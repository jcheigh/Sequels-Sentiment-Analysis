0,9,My Favorite Of The Harry Potter Films,"I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it."
1,8,"Finally, a movie that captures the books' magic","If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet."
2,10,Best Film of the Series; One of the Best Films of All Time,"I wish Alfonso Cuaron would come back to the franchise. I know that he probably won't, but I still hope. After all, as we float through this empty, depressing world, sometimes all we have is hope. He detached this film franchise from its safe-as-a-CIA-file roots and allowed it to grow wings and fly into a silver ether. To anyone who thinks franchise films cannot be art... check out LOTR. But once you are done, check out this film. It is both ironic and darkly appropriate that this is both the lowest grossing Harry Potter film and the one that many film critic types, such as myself, say is the greatest of the octology."
3,9,Darkest and best one yet,"This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger."
4,9,Best of the Harry Potter film series,"The third HARRY POTTER film (still gotta get round to reading the books) and definitely a step in a different direction, with more unpredictable narrative – thank god Harry doesn't have to fight a clichéd monster at the end – and better direction by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, who makes it look darker, gloomier and more magical. It's just as great as the last two (if not better – I think this is my favourite of the three) and despite the over-lengthy running time, the interest doesn't let up. "
5,10,last of the really sweet episodes..,.. and near perfect film making.
6,8,A visual feast with bite,"Harry Potter is growing up! The voice is deepening, the shoulders are broadening and...hurray! You no longer feel like a creep for having a little crush on Daniel Radcliffe...whoops, did I say that out loud? Say what you will, I see him making the jump from child star to adult actor in a way that Haley Joel Osment only dreams of."
7,10,Abstract and dark themes abound; still the most mature HP entry,"Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script."
8,8,The best of the Harry Potter films so far,"This third Harry Potter film is the best one yet. Director Alphonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, A Little Princess) has taken over from Chris Columbus and has stuck less slavishly to the original JK Rowling Books."
9,10,Directing and screenwriter stand out in perfection,"Everyone's favorite of the Harry Potter movies is the first one, right? A close second place for me and my family is the third installment: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only is the story very interesting, fast-paced, and full of mysterious twists, but director Alfonso Cuaron turns ordinary exposition shots into works of art. After seeing the same castle and sets the past two movies, it's intriguing to see them filmed differently. It reminds you to pay attention to details as well as the big picture, and it subtly tells you that you'll need to see the movie at least twice to understand its full potential. There's a famous transition he films through the clock tower that's continually gorgeous no matter how many times you've seen it."
10,8,A valiant effort bringing a truly complex book to screen!,"This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox"
11,9,"So dark, I love it","This is one of my favourites of the franchise because I love Sirius Black and time travelling. Harry Potter's universe was still full of surprises at this point and the films never failed to impress. I also noticed a better soundtrack as well - not that it wasn't already pretty good in the previous ones, I just liked this one better. Oh, and RIP Richard Harris (this is the first one with Michael Gambon)."
12,9,"Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous - Spoilers","If you're anti-Potter you owe it to yourself to see this film. Get past the issues you might have with the immense hype around the franchise and sit down for two hours to be captivated by this creepy, quirky and beautiful film. If you're a Potter-fan and you're unhappy with the film, the novel is probably on the table in front of you and you're better off reading it again. This is a wonderful film despite your expectations or opinions as to how it 'should have been done'."
13,9,A Dark and Impressive Film,"Harry is maturing and becoming more and more involved in that past that has brought him here. Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment."
14,,A new director who proves equal to the task.,"Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the images conjured by J.K. Rowling's magical words and created from her book, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' a film rife with visual symbolism and alive with inventive images beyond those established by the first two films in the series. Cuarón, a native of Mexico City and the acclaimed director of the completely compelling, frequently hilarious and sexually explicit coming-of-age film, 'Y tu mamá también,' was seen by many as an odd choice to follow heartland American Chris Columbus into the Harry Potter director's chair. The selection has resulted in a film darker and more mature than its predecessors, just as was the book, but it is also as approachable for young people as Cuarón's other internationally heralded work, 'A Little Princess.'"
15,8,Best of the three,"Although this film isn't all that I'd hoped it would be, I believe that it was the best of the three 'Harry Potter' films so far, thanks largely due to director Alfonso Cuaron. In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry."
16,8,"Beautifully dark, but with holes","This work is beautifully dark and lovingly done, but it does leave gaping holes in J. K. Rowling's magical world. The close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is obliterated, as is Hermione's almost conspiratorial relationship with McGonagal. You are never told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are (a necessary element). They completely avoid the fact that Snape has knowledge of Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and Harry received the Firebolt at the beginning of this work rather than the end. The whole incident at the Shrieking Shack was changed and lost too much in the translation. Crookshanks was calumniated from a beloved kneazle to a noisome feline who'd be more likely to pee in your shoes than help you, aside of course from his determination to eat Scabbers."
17,6,"A more ""grown-up looking"" Harry Potter adventure, held back by lacklustre plot and over-active camera work.","The third Harry Potter film has a better 'look' than the previous two. The colours and photography are much darker, presumably to reflect the darker turn taken by the story. It's clear that new director Alfonso Cuaron is intent on moving the series into a more grown-up, emotionally engaging, self-consciously moody realm of film-making. What lets Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban down is the absence of a truly compelling storyline (it hovers constantly on the verge of something really good, but never quite gets there). There's also an irritating over-emphasis on the camera work, more of which will be said later."
18,9,Writing in character again --- on Prisoner of Azkaban,"Well, once more we have another journey into the struggle for the future of Hogwarts. This time, the quest involves the saga of Sirius Black. Who is he? Why is he on the prowl for young Harry? And what, ultimately, is the truth behind the murder of James and Lilly Potter, Harry's parents? The tale opens with yet another killer title sequence, this time bringing the familiar Warner Bros. shield to light in spurts before focusing on Harry's 'homework assignment,' if you will --- the Lumos Maxima spell. After this, we come to the first segment of the story proper. Now aged 13, Harry is angrier, and more unsure of his destiny than in his previous adventures at Hogwarts. His rage against one of the Dursleys' relatives intensifies when he finally decides it's not worth it to remain there (""Anywhere's better than here,"" he complains to Uncle Vernon)."
19,9,Charming and Extraordinary,"As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts."
20,8,"""A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who've forgotten how to listen.""","I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the quality of the reviews for this film from fans who follow both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter franchise. To say that they've invested a significant amount of time into their hobby would be an understatement. I don't bring that same intensity to my viewing of the Potter films, for me it's a Saturday evening family entertainment, and the franchise has served well so far. This one had an interesting balance of humor and a more serious dark side, and youngsters might actually wind up with a nightmare or two after watching 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I remember as a kid being scared of a tree in the middle of a meadow that someone told me would make a grab if you got too close, so I made it a point not to get too close."
21,9,One of the best in the series,Harry leaves his adoptive family and returns to Hogwarts.
22,8,Black Could Be Anywhere,"It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry. "
23,10,Nice,Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better
24,9,My favorite book has become my favorite of the movies,"My favorite of the books, and the movie is pretty good, too. I do miss Richard Harris, though, and I was a little disappointed by the look of the werewolf. Too spindly."
25,7,"awesome special effects, decent plot","I think movie wise, this was the best of the Harry Potter films. The story was OK, but of course the books are better because they have so much more detail."
26,9,"A Good Potter Film, But Not The Best!","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fabulous movie for entertainment but a teeny disappointment for avid HP book readers like myself. This time around, Harry enters his third year and he must deal with an escaped convict who is seemingly after Harry. The acting in this film is better than the first two. As the main actors(Radcliffe, Grint,and Watson)grow up, their abilities seem to improve. The supporting actors were good, but they needed a bit more screen time. Also, it's nice to see normal clothing instead of robes. The new director, Cuaron did a good job. He added a different style into this film. The music by the famous John Williams is different, but good. Finally, some sub-plots were cut out. I wished to see Harry and his win of the Quidditch cup. Other than that, this movie is pretty good. I rate this film a 9/10."
27,9,prisoner of azkaban,"Prisoner of azkaban is defienenetly the best part of this series ,the best part is that is also great stand alone film and it can be watched like that and not as part of huge franchise,cuaron brouth to us one visually beautiful film fulled with great story expecely time traveling part that is made percise and with good sense how time traveling works,for that this makes prisoner of azkaban my favourite part and i bealive to many others fans also"
28,9,"The best installment of them all, masterfully directed by Cuaron","It's quite a miracle, actually, that prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite film in the series, seeing as it's book form is not one I find myself returning to very often. However, Cuaron turns what, in my opinion, is one of the weaker storylines in the hp universe, into a power house of a film that far surpasses my expectations of what a hp film could produce. For starters, It takes creative liberties that work seamlessly with the source material (unlike the previous two which were bland carbon copies of the books). It is also a visual treat, well shot and edited, with a signature directorial feel that helps it stand out from the often one note style of the other adaptations. The grounds of hogwarts are expanded through Cuarons vision and make for a more lived in and welcoming world for us outsiders. The atmosphere Cuaron creates aids in ushering in a justifiable dark tone to the series, a tone that continues to deepen in further installments. John Williams is at the top of his game here, perfecting the score he has been building upon in the previous films. The young acting trio of Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint take tremendous steps with the guidance of Cuaron and start to really become comfortable in their respective roles. The additions of David thewlis, Michael Gambon, Timothy spall, and the amazing Gary Oldman (who is perfectly cast as the misunderstood Sirius Black) just continue to stack an already all star British cast. The humor is punctual and never feels out of place, a good reminder that, while this is definitely a darker hp film, it still has the endearing child like vibe of the franchise."
29,10,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,10/10 - the third installment is a cinematic tour de force that does not let up in its wondrous adaptation of the even-better series of novels
30,10,Expecto Patronum!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is easily the best of the Harry Potter films, and there is one simple reason for that: Alfonso Cuarón! After two films done by the capable, but workmanlike Chris Columbus, Warner Brothers realised their needed a stronger storyteller for when the Harry Potter films started to turn darker, and an excellent Mexican director stepped into the frame."
31,9,POWER OF TIME TRAVEL.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes on the power of time travel and does an amazing job explaining itself throughout the movie and making everything tie in. Between the Uncle and the rat, the twists were unforeseeable ending creating a great third movie in the series."
32,9,The Best Wizarding World Movie Available,"In my opinion, it's here where Harry Potter's story really starts to take off. The first two novels are decent books, but they're pretty similar to the dozens of other Orphan-learns-magic storylines that populate (and pollute) YA literature. ""Azkaban"" is where Rowling pulled back the curtain to show us what the Wizarding World really held, and it's also one of the tightest stories in terms of what Harry and his friends set out to accomplish during their year at Hogwarts. Simply stated, ""Azkaban"" is about as magical an adaptation as we could've hoped for."
33,9,One of the best,As for me and many of my friends this is one of the best of the series. 
34,10,The best of the Harry Potter movies!,HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the third installment of the HARRY POTTER film series and it is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.
35,5,Anorexic,There are some sensationalist reviews here that believe the hype that everything Harry Potter is great and give the movie five stars regardless (the book of Azkaban was definitely a 5 starrer) but this movie ain't so great I'm afraid.
36,9,It keeps getting better!,This movie is my second favorite of all the Harry Potters. It's action packed and fun! I loved the whole concept with the time turner! And the new characters are some of my favorites. Everyone is completely fun and quite interesting in this movie. The whole movie is iconic from finish to end!
37,8,Following to Harry Potter films as exciting and amusing as the former and subsequent entries,"Again Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) of J.K. Rowling's saga , he is , nowadays , living with their embittered uncle Richard Griffths and aunt Fiona Lewis and is called to return at Hogwar's college .There , he'll find his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) , Hermione (Emma Watson) and enemies as the malevolent Braco Malfoy (Tom Felton) ; besides , the usual teachers incarnated by Maggie Smith , Alan Rickman , Michael Gambon or other recent ones , as Emma Thompson and David Thewlis , as well as Rubeus (Robbie Coltrane). Meanwhile , a convicted assassin called Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Wizard's prison and he is looking for Harry to kill him . Harry is attempting to cope with the supernatural beings named Dementors sent to chase at Sirius . "
38,,Way to go,"Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as ""Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs."" I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think ""Wow, how young they all are, how naive."" The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path."
39,,Spaniard in the Works,Spoilers herein.
40,10,Perfects The Harry Potter Formula.............,Just such a achievement to me. The character development dives so much deeper in this film then the second (not to put anything against the second) and it works so good. Each character they introduce and continue on are very likeable in there own way. I think this is the only franchise that doesn't have a single character I don't like. The plot develops very far and brings in so much more world building opportunities. Which is always a good thing in the Wizarding world. This movie definitely feels darker but still has that childhood magical wonder to it. Overall this was a great film and is easily one of (if not the) most watchable movie in the franchise.
41,6,"While still a good movie, it's the worst of the series.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the worst film in the series, because too much of the style has been changed. Chris Coloumbus set a standard for how the Harry Potter universe should look. He had everything done a certain way, and it was perfect to the Harry Potter mythos. Now, a new director has come aboard with a completely different vision, and he did it his way."
42,9,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) - Expecto Patronum!,"Chapter 3 of the Harry Potter series, ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" takes place where Harry learns about a wizarding criminal named Sirius Black who escaped Azkaban prison, sent his parents to Voldemort, and is actually Harry Potter's godfather. But it turns out that not everything is actually the same as it looks. Actually, Sirius Black was really innocent, and framed by Peter Pettigrew who actually betrayed Harry's parents, and who was in disguise all along as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. Then other stories start to happen like the new teacher is actually a werewolf, and there are these guards of Azkaban who take away souls called Dementors. But enough of the spoilers, and let's start the real review. Now, there were some moments of charming cleverness in the script, and the movie felt new, unique, and smart. There were even funny scenes in the film that included my favorite scene involving the giant Knight Bus with a Shrunken Head in control. Now although those moments were enjoying, this particular movie in the series didn't feel epic, amazing, excellent, or surprising like the first two movies were. But even though the movie wasn't that stunning like I thought it was, the movie was smart with story and characters. But still, the movie was kind of charming and magical just like the first two movies were. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", in my review, ""smart and clever, but nothing epic""."
43,8,A change in direction...,"Returning for a third year at Hogwarts, it's time for a change in director and a change in tone - resulting in a more grown up feeling film than the first two. There are some genuinely creepy moments here, certainly for any kids watching, and the plot is somewhat more complex than the earlier efforts, with double crosses and time travel elements. I have got say though, as much as I did enjoy this film, it felt very much part of a bigger picture as opposed to its own self contained entry, and as such as viewed as a standalone film struggles to work. It starts assuming you have seen the previous entries, and doesn't really end with any sort of payoff. Its better than chamber of secrets for sure, and an enjoyable watch as part of a saga, but on its own feels like a stepping stone to more. Still, the Dementers were cool, and the main trio are noticably becoming more confident with each film..."
44,10,Where Series Turns Dark,If You Where Wondering When And Were The Harry Potter Movies Turned Dark Will Watch This One
45,8,Cuaron saves this series for me,POSITIVES:
46,9,"A wonderfully put together film, both in style and substance.","Well for me at least, having just had my third viewing of this, the third instalment in the Harry Potter franchise, and I'm pleased to report that now I'm finally at peace with how I feel about Alfonso Cuarón's delightful picture. When I first watched this film upon its DVD release, I found myself yearning for the children to be children again, it was as if the magic had gone, for the reason I liked the first two films was because they allowed me to be childlike again, was the franchise losing it's fantastical ability to draw the viewer in and make us feel magically childlike? Thankfully some four years later I'm positively beaming about it's wonderful adult aura, the professionally handled structure, and yes, the delightful magical charm at every turn."
47,10,Hogwarts is Back in Session,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a masterful addition to the Harry Potter series, bringing a new level of depth and maturity to the beloved characters and story. The film, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, expertly balances darker themes and a more ominous tone with the wonder and magic that has come to define the series. The performances, particularly from the returning cast members and the introduction of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, are top-notch. The special effects are stunning, particularly in the film's action-packed finale. Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is a thrilling and satisfying continuation of the Harry Potter story that will leave fans eagerly anticipating the next installment."
48,8,Alfonso Cuaron Should've Directed the Remaining HP Films,"Its quite fair to say that Chris Colombus did a great job with the first two Harry Potter films. I was quite unsure about what Alfonso was able to produce, but he has done it. He finally captures the true brilliance of JK's story and brilliantly puts it into a film. This film seems closest to the books and I thought it was brilliant. Perhaps the best Harry Potter film out of them all."
49,9,Stylish adaptation with lovely visuals,Rating
50,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"OK, finished the third installment of the Harry Potter series and still doing fine, lol. I have to say that this was a great installment into the series, I still haven't read the books, so I cannot judge on those, only the films. So the Prisoner of Azkaban I must say had a much more dark side of the story, the kids are now a little more grown up and facing much more terrifying things as the head on to become great sorcerers. The cast is still doing great things together, same as the other films with a great addition of Gary Oldman. The story seemed also a bit stronger than the other Harry Potter films."
51,9,Best in the Series.,"Review:<br /><br />'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is a fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and which is the third instalment in the Harry Potter film series.<br /><br />This movie is where the franchise starts to get darker while its core audience gets more mature. Alfonso Cuarón brings a dark tale which feels like a Soviet revenge story and it's so good!<br /><br />The story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and intends to kill him.<br /><br />I feel like Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor in this movie. That's unfortunate because all of these focus around him, and this is one of the most important movies in the series. When he was in a scene leaning his Patronus with Professor Lupin, he was good, and I was invested. But when he learns a secret about Sirius Black and gets angry, he doesn't do a good job at showing emotion. It took me out a bit. However, everybody else brings their A-Game. Gary Oldman being brought into the series is fantastic, and this is the first time we see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fine, but I did find myself missing Richard Harris as the soft spoken and wise Professor.<br /><br />This is the 'Harry Potter' film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. And above all else it is beautifully shot and edited.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion this is the best in the series. It has so much story to tell and adds important characters to the main story of the series.<br /><br />4.5/5"
52,9,"The ""Harry Potter"" franchise at (broomstick's) cruising speed...","Animaguses and werewolves, a flying hypogriff, which is a pleonasm, night buses, talking paintings, time turners and so on and so forth... all these exciting products of J.K. Rowling's fruitful imagination blending with centuries of fantasy literature, bloom as smoothly as naturally in the third opus of the Harry Potter's series: ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I liked it a lot and I was surprised by how much I liked it."
53,8,It was a terrific experience.,"Sometimes I got angry with myself for not reading the books when I was a kid. Even though it was too late, I read the books. I loved this movie (since I didn't read the book when I was a kid) and it was also a little scary for me. It was a terrific experience."
54,9,A solid work of art.,This movie marks the departure of the lightheartedness of the previous movies into a much more serious and somber journey. The moody visuals and cinematography convey the inner emotional experiences of the characters. The scene with the Dementors on the train captured everything I'd imagine when reading the book. They definitely did the book justice w/ this movie.
55,,A darker Potter... could have used more humor...,"What strikes me most about this third Potter film is how truly dark it is during its two hours and twenty minutes of storytelling. Darker both in theme and in cinematography. Although the photography is striking at times, too much of the film is enveloped in darkness which is going to make a lot of the special effects look a lot less intriguing when it makes its transition to home video."
56,10,Beautiful,"Beautiful movie, one of the best of the saga, dark and gloomy. With this film we begin to face dark and more mature themes of the wizard who has now grown up and faces an adventure among the most disturbing that there are against creatures that have become iconic."
57,8,Cuaron never dissapoints,The Prisoner of Azkaban is directed by my favorite Harry Potter director Alfonso Cuaron. Cuaron brings fresh and beautiful shots to Harry Potter universe. This isn't my favorite Harry Potter movie but I would say it is in top 4. This is the best way to start making darker and darker Harry Potter films.
58,10,Superb jump in quality,"It's the same writer, so what changed? Simple, the director.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuarón showed his talent, ingenuity and imagination, to bring to life the already good scripts that were wasted in the first two movies."
59,9,JK And The Film World At Its Best,"I liked this film so much, I read as many of the negative reviews as possible. (In an attempt to remain balanced!) Here, JK is at the height of her literary powers. So, I can completely sympathise with the dedicated book fans who shout loudly regarding the curse of film-making... Plot editing and adaptation."
60,10,Most beautifully directed Harry Potter,"The hippogriff scene with the John Williams score is pure cinematic amazement. The creepy dementors, the night bus, Aunt Marge blowing up, Harry not taking crap from anyone anymore, the ""Ridiculous"" scene, the quidditch scene in the sky, the New Albus Dumbledore, the character of Serious Black, and Harry's personal growth and sense of self-discovery throughout the film is all ""brilliant"" material to say the least!"
61,10,One of the Best Fantasies on Film,"I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all."
62,10,"More than just the best ""Potter"" film (to date). It can also hold it's own against the best of fantasy entertainment.","If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff (""Don't pull out his feathers,"" warns Hagrid, ""cause he won't thank yer for that!""). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration."
63,10,"Not Only the Best Potter Film, but One of the Greatest Films Ever Made",This film defined my childhood. I am a 2000s kid and there is no other the film that gets me to feel like a kid again but this one. Prisoner of Azkaban has everything you want from a cinema-going experience from a perfect cast to perfect cinematography to perfect direction.
64,10,Expect(o) to be let down by future installments,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the only installment of the Harry Potter series to stray from the formula ""Voldemort is trying to kill Harry"". That's one of the reasons I liked this movie so much. It lacks the sense of impending peril present in ""Sorceror's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" and the lack of oppressive atmosphere allows for the most complete (as of movie 4) character exploration of the entire series."
65,10,GREAT,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is great. I can see why this is most Potterheads' favorite HP film, thanks to the perfect story, the time travel sequence and Alfonso Cuaron's direction. It is not my favorite HP film but it is definitely great."
66,10,Much better than the first two movies combined,"Harry Potter is back and this time it's more enjoyable than the first two movies. To be honest here, I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story, but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry, Hermione, and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared, as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor, the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured, and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two."
67,10,8 Great Movies. 1 True Masterpiece.,"You really get a sense of the filmmaker behind the movie here. Chris Columbus's films were brilliant in their warmth and whimsy, but you never got the sheer stylistic watermark present here. Alfonso Curaon's Prisoner of Azkaban can be isolated from the remaining 7 Harry Potter's, and standing alone you'd still have a piece of movie magic."
68,6,Animagus!?!?!,"This is probably my favourite book in the series. I read the books late and after I had watched the films (I recommend reading them first). One of the reasons that it is my favourite book is because this is one of the most least explained films. Why the hell would they not explain why Sirius and Peter are able to be an Animagus???And also in NONE of the films do they ever explain that James Potter is also an animagus and transforms into a stag, hence the reason Harry's patronus is a stag. They also haven't shown they form of Harry's patronus at all in this film. There are loads of other reasons why I have this film a 6/10. It's not awful, like I said I really enjoy watching all the films, but this particular one really gets on my nerves in terms of content from the books."
69,8,Care for tea?,"As a Potter fan, the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle, no more, no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way, but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two, nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books, they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough, there were things I liked, but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did, all of them, those little brats, all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance! "
70,9,Best Film of The Series,Of The 7 films made this is very much my favourite and l would give it 9 out of 10.
71,9,The best in the entire series!,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was directed by Alfonso Cuarón and is the third entry in the Harry Potter franchise. After the second movie, ""Chamber of Secrets"" felt just as childish and very similar to its predecessor, the decision was made to hire a new director for the next instalment. This was not only justified but also much needed for the series, as this is the first movie that is a lot more dedicated to its characters and generally feels much more suited for adults through its dark themes."
72,9,My favourite Harry Potter film,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) directed by Alfonso Cuarón is my favourite of the entire series - due to its clever plot with time-warping, Cuarón's brilliant direction, and the magic intact from the earlier films. As a note, I am also a fan of the later films, which are more ominous and dark in their atmospheric expression."
73,7,a mixed review,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a ""fan film"". By this I mean the makers have made the assumption the majority of viewers, the core audience - are fans of the Potter series. As a stand alone film would leave a viewer confused by a fast moving plot devoid of a lot of detail contained in the original book which the film quite closely follows. To fully appreciate the movie, prior knowledge through reading the book would be most beneficial, it would allow you to fill in the many blanks."
74,7,A darker offering but still as magical,"I have to admit that when I first saw the PoA, I didn't receive it as warmly as the previous two outings. However after viewing PoA again at the cinema and subsequently on DVD, I tend to believe it virtually as well done as Chamber of Secrets and hence slightly less than Philosopher's Stone. There are still the little tricks and quirks that make it 'Harry Potter' and all characters returning are great... except one. It was with great sorrow I heard the passing of Richard Harris and therefore I tried to look with respect and allow that Dumbledore is replaced by Michael Gambon and give him the benefit of the doubt. However the shoes of Richard Harris are too big for him to fill. The majesty of Dumbledore is not the same and regardless of good intentions, it detracts from the movie."
75,8,Harry Potter and the Difference of Direction.,"This third Harry Potter film strays from both the lighter Chris Columbus movies and the book it is based on. This means that it sticks out like a sore thumb, but it is a well directed sore thumb. It is by far the most exciting of the three movies. The movie may not be quite as magical as the first two, but it does capture some of the severity of the book. The scene in the shrieking shack is tense. The scene where Harry goes into a hallway after seeing Peter on the Maurauder's Map, while not in the book, is still an effective scene. I think that it was wise to take out the center of the book, because, none of the movies written by Steven Kloves are very faithful except in structure anyway. Why keep the basic story, but slant everything and say ""we are faithful""? The removal of the middle made the film easier to make exciting without that all that nasty character development that we hate so much. Fans of the book looking for a straight adaptation will be and have been disappointed. If Mike Newell can combine Columbus's whimsy with Cauron's tension, Goblet of Fire may be magical and exciting. Of course, this is assuming that Steve Kloves will stop doing the Reader's Digest versions of the books in his screenplays. The actors are growing up nicely. There is a stronger Daniel Radcliffe and a Hermonie that is ready for her date with Krum. Unfortunately, Richard Harris, who was a fine Dumbledore, is no longer with us. He is missed. The new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon is very different, but stronger in his portrayal. The music by John Williams is impressive as always. This is a very good movie that must be approached openly, although I would be very open to a version that followed the book more closely."
76,,Darker and thus better than the first two but still far too baggy and slow,"Its Harry's third year at Hogswarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry and he returns there in a rush having accidentally used magic at home. Forgiven for this by an understanding Ministry, Harry learns that the murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is supposedly coming to finish his killing spree by murdering Harry. With the cruel and ruthless Dementors circling Hogswarts looking for Black, Harry resides in fear until he learns the truth about Black and longs for to find him and extract his own revenge."
77,8,The First Potter Film to Feel Like a Film,Alfonso Cuaron picks up the reigns of the blockbuster film franchise from Chris Columbus. The result is the first Harry Potter movie to feel like a movie and have its own cinematic vision.
78,10,They got it right,"After all these years since it was released, this has become one of my all-time favorite movies. It took a while to grow on me. I appreciate the artistry and detail that Cuaron and Kloves brought to the adaptation of Rowling's book."
79,8,Something wicked this way comes,"For the third Harry Potter film, director Chris Columbus was replaced with Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, recently a double Academy Award winner for ""Gravity"". The film scored nominations for its score and visual effects with the Academy, but lost out as all the other Potter movies did. Personally, I would say that Azkaban is better than the second installment and worse than the first, but easily one of the three best movies from the whole series. It is also one of the most successful films at the box office from 2004. It starts again at Potter's home as a mean relative comes to visit his aunt and uncle, insults his parents and promptly gets turned into a balloon by Potter. The knight bus (nice wordplay) arrives right in time to save the boy from his raging relatives."
80,9,At Last Harry 's Getting Powerful,"Harry's third outing, is the best yet. Some new characters and some key historical pieces of the plot are weaved into the story. This movie is far darker than the first two and Harry is growing up and growing into the powerful wizard that he is supposed to be. No longer always in Hermione's shadow Harrys magical powers are needed now more than ever, stalked as he is by the Dementors (these are cool) "
81,9,Surprisingly Awesome,"I would like to mention that Alfonso Cuarón has done a great job. The treatment of the movie is totally different from the previous installments. The magical world has not only grown much darker but it has taken for of a thriller. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown not only in age but skills as well as they give a great performance.The movie has taken shape of a much more complexity.Its no longer just about the Quidditch matches or the menacing Malfoy but its much more than that. The whole movie has a suspenseful environment and it holds on to it from beginning to end. The climax especially is great and more mature than the previous installments. Overall I think this is the best installment from the three. Totally amazing experience and close to perfect."
82,8,Greatest of the bunch,"After the success of the first 2 films, the producers knew they needed to step up their game with this one, so they started off with a change of directors with the talented Alfonso Cuarón. Out came a heavily darker, but better developed sequel with great performances and awesome visuals. The additions of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were flawless and the cgi was impressive for the time. A must see!"
83,7,Something wicked this way comes.,"''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' show us a darker look of Harry Potter's stories. The scenarios are dark,we have more mystery, more tension and even more surprises during this film than the other Harry Potters.''Harry Potter and The Globet of Fire'' is the best of all Harry Potters movies until now, but 'Prisoner of Azkaban'' comes in second place because it has more adult elements than the other two previous films,making some people see that Harry Potter is not a book only for little kids. We have now Sirius Black and Lupin, two of the best characters that J.K. Rowlling already have created in all of her life. The things I feel sorry about this film are that many good explanations about Harry's family and life, and also many things about the Marauders are not showed. I also hated the actors they chose to be Sirius Black and Lupin: they are not similar to the real characters I imagined to be, and Lupin's transformation to a werewolf was terrible."
84,10,The best movie in the franchise?,"Wow, just wow! This movie is incredible! It has everything; great acting, excitement, amazing storyline, great new characters, and just an awesome vibe to it."
85,7,Gary Oldman,"I don't know why I pointed him out, but I liked his character here. If you've seen the movie or know the books (I personally haven't done the latter), than you know his serious ... excuse me Sirius Black character is very detailed and fun to play (for him) and to watch (for us the viewers)."
86,9,All grown up,"The third installment in the Harry Potter series sees a significant progression from the cinematic style established in the first two films. Not only is the overall storyline much more dark and sinister, but Alfonso Cuaron, who has replaced Chris Columbus as director for the third film, has revamped the entire Harry Potter ambiance and presentation style."
87,8,Puberty hits at Hogwarts,"I'm discovering the Harry Potter universe only now, and together with my own two kids aged 7 and 13, simply because I felt too old and uninterested to watch the movies when they first came out. Three films and more than eight hours of fabulous fantasy-entertainment later, I can only acknowledge this franchise based on J. K. Rowling's successful novels comes highly recommended to everyone, regardless of what age category you are in."
88,8,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"After giving his rude, overweight aunt her just deserts, teenager Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is off for another year at ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" with fellow magic-makers Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger). You can be sure the trio won't be bored. First out of the gate is dastardly Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black), who was somehow involved in the murder of Mr. Radcliffe's parents. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" referred to in the title, Mr. Oldman looks out for blood. This puts everyone at ""Hogwarts"" in grave danger..."
89,5,What was this one about again?,I have this film totally forgotten as I haven't seen it in years. Pretty much like the first 2 all the actors are back except for the actor who played Dumbledore as he passed away in 2002(Richard Harris) and was replaced by Micheal Gambon. I think this one had a dragon in it or was that the Goblet Of Fire? 
90,7,The Series Darkens,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, and marks a new departure for that series in several ways. It was the first in the series to be released in summer; the original idea was for the series to consist of seven films, one of which was to be released at Christmas every year between 2001 and 2007. This schedule proved to be over-ambitious and the third film was released in midsummer 2004 rather than Christmas 2003."
91,,"Not Bad, But Not Brilliant","***Spoilers*** and References to The Goblet of Fire. Were to start, it's hard to pinpoint were the movie went wrong because there was so much great material to work with. The Prisoner of Azkaban had many things going for it post production. A great actor lineup, two previously successful installments and of course high anticipation of its release. Nevertheless, it was hard to watch. The movie started of quite strongly, and then the quality took a nose dive only to recover at the end. Although that means that more than half of the movie was good it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth since a little editing could have fixed this problem. A lot of people felt that the movie was too dark, well the book was dark. I think the underlying problem was certain parts were just poorly done and other parts were meant to compensate for them. POA starts out quite solid, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is gutting out another summer with the Dursley's and is provoked by his uncle's sister into using magic. At this time in the movie, I was getting over the initial shock of lack of Christopher Columbus while resisting the new hand held camera techniques applied by Alfonso Cuarón."
92,6,Dissatisfied (some SPOILERS ahead),"Comparing this movie with the previous two might seem a little ludicrous considering the different director and the general tone of the movie and book, but after seeing this you can't but long for the bustling hubbub of The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets."
93,5,Good but disappointing,"I have read all 5 Harry Potter books that are out at the time and so far, number 3 is my favorite. You can imagine my excitement in wanting to see this movie. The first one was okay and the second one was much better. Learning a new director was behind this one thrilled me even more, thinking 'Excellent, it'll appear new and be the best movie too'. Wrong. Very wrong. *May contain Spoilers after here* Okay, what enraged me the most was the sudden handgrabbing with Hermione and Ron. That was never even thought of in the book because they fought through almost the entire thing! How dare the stupid movie makers/writers even try to give people that haven't read the book that idea! Another quality I disliked was that they rarely showed teachers from previous movies, it showed not one Charms, Transfiguration, or Potions class. Find that alittle odd? You see Professor McGonagal and Dumbledore maybe three times throughout the film. Next, I must be angry with the wardrobers! Why were they in normal clothing almost throughout the entire thing! We even saw before that outside of classes they still had to wear uniforms! Another thing is the explanation of things. The pace of this movie was too fast and they never explained that Moony was Remus Lupin, Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew, Padfoot was Sirius Black, and Prongs was James Potter. They also didn't explain how Sirius escaped from Azkaban. Other various things were left out. The ending, which usually has Harry leaving the train was left out completely(I mean, all the books ended that way, the movie should've too). Instead we get a shot of Harry trying out his Firebolt..."
94,,No longer for little kids,Spoilers  
95,7,Great Cinematography,"This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. The cinematography is really unique and creative. The original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying. All in all, very good."
96,9,One of the Best Films in the Franchise,"This movie is such a creative shift in the saga. Alfonso Cuarón directs a masterpiece that introduces us to Dementors, and a complex and harrowing Prisoner named Sirius Black. The lighthearted tone of the previous films turns into a dreadful and riveting journey in this movie. This is one of the best Harry Potter films of all time."
97,9,Cuaron and company rise this to the level of near pop-art; Harry Potter moving on up in style and substance,"After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director's seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It's an interesting choice, as he had only done one 'family-friendly' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I've yet to read 'Azkaban' or any of the books, from what I've heard from those that have it's a book that doesn't seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging 'plot'. We're only learning so much about Potter's lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the ""dark lord."" "
98,8,Azkaban,The Prisoner of Azkaban is when the Harry Potter series takes a turn for the better. The quality in film and budget has seemingly increased and the story begins to take a more dark and serious tone. It's very cool to watch the story line evolve with the characters as they also grow and mature. This particular movie really sets the stage for the movies to come while still being entertaining and surprising itself. I think this was one of the better movies of the series for character development and setting the tempo for things to come. Another masterpiece in one of the best series to ever do it.
99,8,The Best of the Harry Potter franchise,"10 Years after it's release, this film remains my favorite of the Harry Potter franchise. The 3 leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) have settled into the characters and the world of movie making and are more than capable of steering these movies. The supporting cast of British acting royalty (Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Robert Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, David Thewliss and Gary Oldman) have a good time playing in this world and the plot is the most interesting of the series."
100,5,A new yardstick for movies,"The Potter series is undoubtedly aimed at the 8-14 age range. I've no doubt that anyone in this age range will measure the films of the future against these films. I've no doubt I'll be castigated for saying this, but I don't think the films work for adults. Ignoring the excessive use of cgi ,I suspect that this is mostly down to the wooden acting of the three leads. Strangely, I've started siding with Malfoy who seems much more sympathetic than the aloof Potter."
101,7,"True to the spirit of the book, though not to the letter","I think this third installment of the HP series is remarkable in that, with a consistent and contagious dark atmosphere, it brings out the psychological dimension of Harry's adventure, and illustrates that his struggle in his own psyche is as fierce as that on conventional battlegrounds.Cuaron¡¯s rather idiosyncratic vision as a director has instilled this movie with a memorable artistic identity, hereby making it something considerably deeper than an ordinary kid¡¯s adventure flick. "
102,5,Not my favorite of the series,"If there is a Harry Potter film that could be removed w/o contributing much to the plot, I'd say it's either this one or the seventh one."
103,10,"Where Harry Potter became ""cool""","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best Harry Potter movie. From a filmmaking standpoint, everything about this film is improved compared to the first two films. The script, the acting, the cinematography, everything is crisp and perfect."
104,1,"PoA has ""magic"" but ""not magical enough"" like the previous 2 ****Spoilers A-Plenty****","(6/10, out of which 4.5 goes to Buckbeak) How I looked forward to this movie cannot be summarized in a paragraph.. and then when I saw it...hmmm...this looked like a regular movie that had some magic but was in ""No way Magical enough"" as I quite liked the Chris Columbus presentation and his attention to detail in the previous two.. Don't get me wrong, Cuaron does a pretty good job but his style is more 'Artsy'."
105,10,The best Harry Potter film!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) follows Harry as he returns to Hogwarts and faces a new threat, an escaped convict name Sirius Black. This is my favourite film of the franchise! It's super entertaining with a lot of tension, mystery, and some very memorable new characters."
106,6,"Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.","After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer."
107,8,A technical master class,Rating-8/10
108,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Now 13, Harry Potter and chums are back off to Hogwarts, only to find that a dangerous escaped prisoner is also heading back to school. Soon nasty prison guards called Dementors have taken up residence in the school grounds."
109,2,Wrong Director and Wrong Dumbledore,"This has never been a favorite of mine in the Harry Potter series. In fact I had some friends who refused to watch anymore Harry films after seeing this one. I had to convince them that the others were better. The arrogance of Sir Michael Gambon knows no bounds. I just read in the trivia that he never read any of the books to get an idea of who Dumbledore is because he just always puts himself into the role. Yes that's right, I really go to the movies just to see home movies of Michael Gambon, not the Harry Potter movies with the wonderful, in control, Albus Dumbledore. The Dumbledore who would never have manhandled Harry in the next movie. My mistake for thinking that I was there to see characters written by J. K. Rowling instead of a piece on Michael Gambon's own ""perfection."" No wonder he always seemed like a weak ghost of the character he was supposed to play."
110,8,Azkaban is better than the other Potters.,The producers made their wisest decision in the Potter franchise yet by switching from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron in the directing position. Cuaron keeps a firm hold on the magical aspects of the story while going into darker territory. The film has more complexities and challenges the viewer more than the previous two chapters. It successfully and even compellingly exploits the intricacies from Rowling's tale and also keeps the content manageable for their marketed age range. Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban tops the other two films well and sets up the fourth chapter well. A victory for Director Alfonso Cuaron and the great cast of talents.
111,7,The good and the bad...,"Like most Harry Potter fans, I found this movie disappointing. I felt that Director Alfonso Cuaron choose style over substance, which is never a good thing in a movie."
112,8,Great use of time,"This movie, about Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger who return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard, is a great third installment of the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011). The story is quite interesting, and the mystery gets more and more intense throughout the movie while it's obvious that this is a darker movie than the previous. What I love the most is the use of time. It's fantastic to watch the interaction between the real-time scenes and the time traveling scenes. And the best of all, the twist where Harry finds out who saved him from the Dementors in a powerful way. Loved every second of it! In addition, this movie didn't disappoint with its script and character development, and the experience was not boring at all. I just had a great time watching this!"
113,1,The Worst Yet,"This movie had me really excited, as the Prisoner of Azkaban was my favourite book. But in the end I was really, honestly disappointed."
114,6,Such mixed feelings about the movie...,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for this movie, I wasn't impressed with it. The trailer was disjointed, it had very odd editing, an odd pacing, it was very short, it showed one scene that I hated the first moment I saw it (Hermione marching down a hill, yelling at Malfoy in the oddest tone, and then punching him... there's just something about that scene that I hate)."
115,8,Interesting,"We have a new actor playing Dumbledore and some new actors as Remus Lupin,Sirius and Pettigrew.Very nice adventure and sets and costumes are still nice and the story is interesting,a bit lighter than Chamber of Secrets to prepares for the darkness which starts with Goblet of Fire.8/10"
116,10,Even wizards go to jail,"Ok it's pretty hard to review each of the potter films as I am a firm believer that a review is not content of the entire film but a mere glimpse and critique of the story and actors. With there being 8 what can I say when I love them all equally, but here goes."
117,10,best of all time,"Harry potter is one of the most outstanding movie of all time.man i just ca not express my feelings that how much i love HR.when i watch it for the first time in 2016 i just totally amazed with this kind of movie and and i totally obsessed with it every time.what a story,characters,settings and especially daniel radcliff's acting.what a amazing movie this is.naive and innocent acting of daniel radclifff's makes me humble every time.each characters each and every character is lovable.what a movie is this."
118,9,Exhilarating to the last shot.,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (""PoA"") is a story identical in structure to the first two books/films. Harry makes a narrow escape to Hogwarts, where he is soon at the center of a complicated mystery. With the help of best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he resolves to unravel the perplexity, which leads to a dramatic and mesmerizing final act."
119,8,My favorite of this series,"Though I'm not really a fan of these types of films, I must say I have enjoyed this entry the most so far. The humor works in this one where it seemed forced in the second. I also enjoyed seeing Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, he's a much stronger presence than Harris's character, and of course buckbeak which to me was like this franchises Falcore. It helped shrinking the quidditch scene as I felt it went too long in the second, and thought the time travel aspect helped in making it more relatable to those of us who grew up with great time travel films ie, Back to the future, Star trek IV the voyage home. Great viewing beginning to end 4.5/5."
120,9,"You're not alone anymore, Harry","The original story may not be as exciting as the first two, but it is the most connotative, to a certain extent, put aside the atmosphere of children's books , the film is also the best in the series. After changing the director,it has a great breakthrough in style, especially at the beginning of the set-up clothing design."
121,10,"JK Rowling says ""Best one yet"" and I agree!!!","You want to slam the director for cutting, cutting, cutting, go for it. I agree, it's painful sometimes to watch a film based on a book and notice the missing pieces everywhere."
122,10,Turn the page 394.,"In my opinion, this is the best one in the series which is odd considering this is my least favorite book in the series (it's still awesome tho). Cuarón was probably the best director this franchise had and it's a shame that he directed only one movie in the series because he captured the magic perfectly. This one was even darker than the 2nd one and I remember how dementors freaked me out as a kid but it's still nothing compared to sequels. Young actors are much better this time, especially Radcliffe. He really surprised me. Watson and Grint did a really good job too. And there is so much new actors in this movie and ,oh my god, they were brilliant. Emma Thompson was hilarious as prof. Trelawney, Timothy Spall in role I'm not gonna mention because, spoilers, and, man, Gary Oldman did such a brilliant job as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon was really good as Dumbledore but still not as good as Richard Harris (R.I.P.) who really was Dumbledore from the book. The effects also look much more realistic in this one and the flight scene with a hipogriff was spectacular and remains one of my favorite scenes in the entire series. At the end, I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie and one of my favorite movies ever!"
123,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"The previous two films were slightly lighter in tone, and this is when it does become much more than a family film, all the following films go up to the 12 certificate, this is obviously the third instalment, from director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) runs away from home after losing his patience living with the Dursleys, and he gets picked up by the Knight Bus, taking him to friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). They all hear that supposedly dangerous criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has done the impossible and escaped from Azkaban Prison, and he apparently has links with Lord Voldermort, and there are rumours he wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. On the way to Hogwarts the three friends and other passengers on the train are encountered by Dementors, the dark creatures that guard Azkaban, they are looking for Black, but they are not thinking when trying to suck out souls from people. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon, replacing Richard Harris who died shortly after the second film) announces these Dementors around, that Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is the new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher, he saved Harry's life from a Dementor. Lessons carry on like normal, including tea life reading from Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and learning to fly Buckbeak the Hippogriff from Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), he is saddened the creature is sentenced to death after attacking Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Professor Lupin teaches a class where a creature called a Boggart is used, this creature turns into whatever someone can think of in the moment that scares them the most, and the given spell defeats it with laughter, Harry unfortunately think of a Dementor and is saved again. He also gets attacked by one during Quittitch, so The Professor decides he needs to learn to defend himself against them, and he also gets a Marauder's Map as he can't go without parental permission to Hogsmeade. After Harry gains more of a want to kill Sirius Black overhearing a conversation, where there is mention that he is his godfather, he, Ron and Hermoine visit Hagrid sympathising that Buckbeak will be killed, and then they run after Ron's rat Scabbers, also avoiding being caught by Dumbledore and others. Chasing him they find a secret passageway under the Whomping Willow that leads to the Shrieking Shack, and there they find a dog that is actually Sirius Black transformed, and Lupin, Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who was Scabbers, also turn up. During the conversation they find out that Black is innocent, it was in fact Pettigrew that committed the crime, but when Lupin sees the full moon and transforms unintentionally into a werewolf he is allowed to escape. Harry and Black are almost finished off again by Dementors, but before fainting Harry thinks he saw his father James defeat them with the Patronus spell, he wakes and is advised by Dumbledore that he and Hermoine should use time to save a life or two. Hermoine reveals she has a time-turner, which explains why she is never late and appears in her lessons, and they have to save Buckbeak, retracing all their steps so as not to be spotted by their past selves, and not change too much. So Buckbeak is saved, the Executioner did not actually kill him, and they wait for the events in the Shrieking Shack to pass, make Lupin the werewolf come their direction to save their past selves, and it isn't Harry's father that saved him, but Harry himself, and they return to the present fine. In the end Sirius decides that it is best that he stays in hiding as he has not been proved innocent of the crime, and the final scene sees that he sent Harry a new Firebolt broomstick, the fastest in the world. Also starring Dame Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Pam Ferris as Aunt Marge, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Dawn French as Fat Lady in Painting, Julie Christie as Madame Rosmerta, Robert Hardy as Cornelius Fudge, Paul Whitehouse as Sir Cadogan (scene cut out), Lenny Henry as Shrunken Head, Warwick Davis as Wizard, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. The young actors grew up very fast and become much more mature, the other actors in the cast do great too, the story is easy to follow, it may be a little odd without Lord Voldermort but it doesn't matter, and of course the scene stealing special effects and action sequences are fantastic, a great fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Written Music for John Williams and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA Audience Award and the Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
124,8,From here it got better,"Prisoner of Azkaban, so far, is still my favourite Harry Potter film, still having not seen them all. This is where everything got better, the way the story was put into action and more importantly the acting from the three main characters. I'm going to admit the first two movies weren't great, particularly Harry, Ron and Hermione. It wasn't believable in the first two because those three characters had the majority amount of screen time. In this movie, the acting was so much better and you could believe it was real. "
125,8,The least cartoon-like of the three films,"Finally, an installment in the Harry Potter series that has a serious amount of intelligence. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the most film-like of the three movies, and definitely the least cartoon-like. It looks like Warner Brothers made a smart move by replacing the director with a professional: Alfonso Cuaron (the new director) sure gives the impression that he knows what he's doing, unlike Chris Columbus' clumsy work on the first two Harry Potter movies. Then again, Cuaron directed some great films, such as ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y tu mama tambien"", while Chris Colombus' major credits are Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. It is quite understandable (and obvious) that Cuaron is the more professional of the two."
126,3,Awful,"Being a big fan of the third book, I had high expectations when I went to see this movie. Boy, was I ever disappointed! This movie has many flaws, but I'll name just a few."
127,10,Um,"Luna lovegood is the backbone of the series, an underused and unapriciated character"
128,8,Harry Potter 3 was Good Enough for Me,"Part two of my Harry Potter reviews is a single review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. This movie is very different from the previous two and also from the next five films. We have the same actors from the other two, the only real difference is the director. The director for this film is Alfonso Cuarón and he put his own directing style into the movie. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did not. He really is the major strength and weakness of the movie itself."
129,6,The Magic is Gone,"The Harry Potter Series is an incredible series, and definitely a must-watch. A young Harry Potter is raised by his strict, inhumane aunt and uncle, with no explanation for the absence of his parents. However, as he grows older he discovers that he has supernatural powers due to being the successor of a legendary wizard. More lore and secrets about Harry are revealed through the series. The world of Harry Potter is a fascinating masterpiece created by JK Rowling, a professional at drawing readers into her work."
130,10,Loved since my childhood,This is truly a perfect Harry Potter movie. I loved the third book and the movie really captured its feeling. I think out of all the movies this one stays the closest to J. K. Rowling's story. The young actors are way better than in the first two and Gary Oldman is just awesome as Sirius Black. I know that some people don't like the story and i agree that it isn't Rowling's best but it's still great and interesting. Cuarón is a fantastic director and the movie looks very beautiful. There is a lot of great dialog and the movie added some amazing new characters.
131,10,Perfect!!!,I was amazed that they were able to do much better than chamber of secrets. Everything was great eccept for the fact that it is still confusing.
132,9,The best harry potter movie.,Now straight away I want to tell you I am not a big Harry Potter fan. I have not read any of the books and I tried in vain to dismiss the phenomenon as a flash in the pan. I sat through the first two movies and found them OK but in large I remained indifferent to them.
133,8,Mischief managed!,"In the first two Harry Potter films, the plots/action are primarily geared towards a much younger audience than the medium. There are some ""tense moments"" and drama in those films, of course, but it isn't until ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" that the series really starts to grow up and deal with some more mature themes."
134,8,The Series Starts To Grow Up,"Why do so many people hail Cuarón as if he's doing something genius with this film? He altered the beginning to add some stupid joke with the wand lighting under the covers (Lumos Maximo would shoot a flare out of the wand. Lumos simply lights it up. - Read the books). And as a 3rd year Harry shouldn't have any trouble with the spell to light his damn wand. It's a dumb joke and it's not even funny when old man Dursly comes in grunting with his weird splotchy cheeks. Who did the make-up on this, btw? This is the worst make up job on everyone except the main cast that I have ever seen in a Harry Potter film. Really, except for the kids and the main teachers everyone seems like they are just plastered on and shoved into the background. Just keep them out of focus. It'll be fine. Sorry, nope. I noticed."
135,4,I don't get it.,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a great sequel and an improvement. The acting is a lot better and the ending is just so wholesome. The plot is very well structured and the pacing is great.
136,9,The best so far.,"I think the only reason to watch any of the Harry Potter movies is to be able to hold on to that Potter ""magic"" a little longer and to be able to see the perfect casting that was done on all the films. The perfect cast only falls short on one occasion and that was the Dumbledore replacement. I just never believed he embodied the humor and deep strength required for that role."
137,5,Read The Book,The third Harry Potter film has finally arrived in cinemas after a rather long two-year wait. Alfonso Cuaron takes over at the director's chair while erstwhile director Chris Columbus becomes a producer.  It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts and this time he must face a new foe in the person of Sirius Black an escaped murderer from Azkaban prison who is out to get Harry.
138,7,"New Director, Same Old Fun","From the beginning, I felt as though I'd come in 5 minutes into the start of the film; as if I'd missed some beginning section, thought I was there from the previews on. This film never got to telling a subset of the story of described in book 3, but rather was a collection of scenes depicting parts of the book, but never evolved into a coherent plot-line that one could follow or feel. I'd read the book; all the books, in fact. That did not help and so I feel those movie goers who had not read, but mearly came for a good film were even more confused and disappointed."
139,5,A hacked job - a sequence of scenes that tell no story.,"First of all let me say that i am a 32 year old man who has never read a harry potter book before, but i love sword and sorcery stories so i've seen all the potter movies. This movie was amazing...the cinematography was the most stunning work i have ever seen on film(and i'm a movie buff and photographer)! It was a visual feast for the eyes...the other potter movies never gave the feel of a magical environment,this did.The night scenes were so beautifully shot that that you felt immersed in an outerworldly realm of magic both good and bad every second.The overall story telling was brilliant and well paced, and i found the story to be very dark and mature.Some moments are a bit too scary for small children ,but everyone should find something to like.This one was about maturing as people and wizards.....and the 3 kids have matured as actors as much as there characters have on screen.It is a travesty that this director doesn't continue with the series. To the potter fans that say this doesn't closely resemble the book, get over it!!! No movie can ever match what you visualized in your mind. As a stand alone movie this was a masterwork."
140,10,amazing.....truly stunning!,What I thought was the highlight of the movie was the two scenes where Harry fights off all of the Dementors when they are attacking him and Sirius. Those scenes were incredible. The score in particular was amazing.
141,6,"Good, but not as good as the first two","Idk about the books but when it comes to the films, I think this is by far the best Harry Potter film. The tone is dark yet still has that magical charm and the cinematography and world building is some of the best in film history."
142,10,The pinnacle of HP,"This movie isn't that great. As a Harry Potter movie, it could be worse. Just because a movie has decent effects and acting, it doesn't mean that a poorly written plot can be easily excused. this movie is entertaining, but is kinda pointless if you think about it. In the end, this movie is mostly filler. Yes, they attempted and succeeded at utilizing time travel in a way that made sense, but the characters are so stupid and the runtime is so long that its hard to care. Watch this movie if you're invested in the franchise, but I wouldn't recommend it."
143,6,Eh,Expectations for one of the most exciting story lines in this series is just overwhelming and this movie does not come close. I thought third time lucky would mean another chance at an objective analysis of this movie. No way. Such an ordinary feel for this magical series. I felt imprisoned to watch it with buckbeak providing much needed relief from time to time. One thing that HAS to be mentioned is the evolution of these kid actors. They have almost become adults but so much more could have been done with their talent.
144,1,'Prisoned' to Watch - Chirs Columbus PLEASE come back!,"A lot of people will tell you this is the best Harry Potter movie, and there's a good reason for that. This is when the series went from enjoyable fun kids movies to a darker and more mature tone suited more for young adults."
145,10,Great directing in this movie.,"When viewing 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', you really begin to see how much more mature the young casting members have become when you cast your mind back to 2001 when they made their Potter debut's, in the 'Philosopher's Stone'. As a member of this current generation, I can soundly say it was a privilege to have grown up with this consistently thrilling and entertaining series of movies - originating from the stimulus of author J.K Rowling."
146,8,From wizarding 11 year old to maturing teenager...Harry's just grown up.,This film is not my favourite shareholder potter movie but I must say that it is really really good.
147,9,Objectively the best of the whole series,Warning: Review includes some mild spoilers.
148,7,Seemed to be a little cut short (mild spoilers),"Harry Potter, the new rage of the century and turning new generations onto reading. Recently this beloved books have been transformed into motion pictures. Other than simple nitpicks the first films, depicting the first two novels in the series were tolerable. They are outlines of the plot and it is understandable why many things were cut and changed so as not to make a PG movie three hours long. Yesterday the new film reflecting the events of the third novel in the series was released and I must say that reviews from the Times to Newsweek are praising it, so it must be better than the satisfactory first two. This assumption is terribly wrong. The turning point of the series the Prisoner of Azkaban is, however unlikely, worse than its sister films. Somewhere at sometime they must've tossed the book out the window and started from scratch. Critical events to the plot were butchered and glazed over and some key points that are important in the future Harry Potter books are not even mentioned. The film went far too fast paced to give the viewer the same satisfaction given when reading the book itself. If you are planning on enjoying this film then I recommend not being a fan of the books or having read them at all. The only ones people who could sit down and watch this film without being purely disappointed are those who have never read the books and aren't planning on it soon. I must say this is absolutely the worst movie adaption and I plan on never seeing this movie ever again, for it has ruined one of the best books in the series. I can only pray that the same writing staff is not hired for the future movies, especially the Order of the Phoenix (e-mail me if you wish me to elaborate or discuss the subject)"
149,1,Disgracing a Noble Series,"Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuaron, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling"
150,8,Incredible,"I did not know who exactly the villain till the end<br /><br />As for quiditch game, it has an improvement compare to the first and the second. This time they have a competition on a stormy days"
151,10,More Exiting and Misterious,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen. It leaves gaping plot holes, is nothing like the book and the only even almost good scene is the time travel in the end."
152,1,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban? I think not,"The Harry Potter Series pulled off to a great start, with two amazing adaptations created by our very own, Chris Columbus. Then I heard about this film and I was quite excited to see it and also very keen that this instalment is going to be better than the two movies I've already seen... after watching this film, I thought it was absolutely brilliant, but it could have been better. "
153,6,"Great movie, full of magic and excitement but sort of lost the essence of Harry Potter ***spoilers***","Amazing movie with a very slow start but it is compensated by the last hour of the movie. I liked Harry and Sirius Black's relationship. It was like that of a father and his son. The acting in the film has improved significantly from the first two parts, the characters of the film were better, and the story of the film was noticeably better than the rest of the parts, I recommend watching it."
154,9,harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"Absolutely phenomenal film with great philosophical messages, acting, producing, directing, etc. It is a renowned and fantastic film! I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
155,10,Phenomenal Film!!,"Listen, I understand that to make a movie from a book you have to leave things out. However, I believe that if a movie is going to made from a book, it should stand on its own. Meaning that you should be able to follow the movie if you haven't read the book. I have read the book, but I saw the movie with people who had not. And we got out of the movie and they were thoroughly confused. And I don't blame them, because the movie failed to explain (1) how Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, (2) how he knew that Pettigrew was Ron's pet and therefore at Hogwarts, and (3) who the 4 Marauders were so it was confusing that Lupin understood what the map was and how it worked. This is just sloppy film making. Add a few lines here and there and it's explained. I can live without the Quiddich and the subplots from the book, but when I have to spend 15 minutes explaining things to people after the movie, the movie is a failure."
156,4,MAJOR plot points left out,"Just finished watching Azkaban for the first time in years (I'm 18, I think I watched Akzaban for the first time when I was about 12). I'm really surprised by how in-depth and detailed this movie is, considering how I thought that only the third film into the series, it would still be quite childish. However, I was proved wrong and left enchanted by a beautifully rich set design and intricate plot- one that in the final act, had me gobsmacked by how interesting and UNIQUE it was!"
157,9,What a wonderful film,"After the first two movies, I expected something similar although the tale was maturing with its characters. What I received was an incredible letdown. I realize that a different director meant a different movie, but I at least wanted a clear and understandable movie. The take jumped from scene to scene, often without connecting information. If I hadn't already read the book, I would never have known why characters were acting the way they were. Also, did anyone notice the altitude change of Hagrid's house? It wasn't that low on the mountain before, was it? I gave this movie a 5, and I'm fervently hoping for a better try next time."
158,5,What a letdown!,"I think all of Hp movies are very interesting that got my attention too. In words too describe as mystery,chills,wizardry, Bravery and comedy.<br /><br />In another topic,I want to say that Michael Gambon's role as Albus Dumbledore was amazing, as we all know, Richard Harris sadly passed away,but you barely can see the difference between both of them. Also,thumbs up to Alfonso Cuaron a mexican director who directed this amazing movie. And here comes the"
159,10,"Few words, a differnce, big spoiler",The scene nearby the lake where Harry and Black are attacked by those dementors (at that moment I experienced best great visual effects) and I thought to myself when one reads the book he might have to imagine what it would be like to face such dastardly health sucking and it is the movie that makes it real (made me feel it).
160,9,Out for a walk in the moonlight!,...turns out I love it!
161,8,Thought I hated it...,"Why couldn't they have Alfonso Cuaron direct the rest of the movies? He did a far superior job than Chris Columbus (what a joke) and David Yates. The transitions, the attention to detail, the comic relief, every part is magic! My favorite part is when Ron is having the nightmare about spiders making him rollerskate, and Harry says, ""You tell those spiders, Ron!"""
162,10,The Best Movie Adaptation In The Franchise,"Who better to play Sirius Black than Gary Oldman, or who better than David Thewlis to play the friendly Professor Lupin. The new characters fit into the story like they have always been a part of it, and maybe indeed they were, as the movie shows the story of the past goes beyond than a small glimpse, and their ties with the boy who lived is much stronger than would have seemed in the first 2 movies. We get a new face to professor Dumbledore who plays a fantastic role, and proves some great acting skills. A captivating, couch gripping story shown in a cinematic depiction for teenagers and young adults, and not only."
163,10,Another great addition to the series,"If this third installment of the Harry Potter series doesn't quite match the magic of the first, it's because - well, this is a sequel, and the 'magic"" no longer surprises quite as much. While it has to be selective due to the fact the novels progressively get longer, this production remains faithful to the book. Alfonso Cuaron as the new series director has been given credit for adding a more substantive darker side and concentrating a bit less on special effects. Regarding the former, the material itself calls for a more grown-up story: the kid characters along with the actors are maturing, and their coming into full-fledged adolescence demands sterner character. There are humorous scenes, but the general tone is more serious, as in fact it must needs be, and Daniel Radcliffe, for one, shows himself quite capable of serious acting as Harry continues to discover his identity. And isn't that Eriksonian quest of youth in fact the real theme of Rowling's series? It looks like most of the cast will be back for the fourth installment: we'll get to see them grow up at least once more."
164,8,Darker but still magical,"I admit to not being a Harry Potter fan but I have seen the other two movies, and found them enjoyable so went to see the new film today."
165,2,Disjointed and Lame,"Maybe I am too jaded today, or maybe I don't like a lot of change, but change came plenty in this third installment of the Harry Potter films. I have never read one printed word of the series, but I did see and enjoy the first two films immensely. They were gorgeous, splendid, exciting films laced with suspenseful action scenes, quirky, genuine acting performances, and likable heroes. Not so for this film. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione age and become teens, I found that I liked them a good deal less as rebellious teenagers(another viewer touched on this earlier). Don't get me wrong. I know it is the natural progression of events. But I see too much of this in real life(and am not fond of it at all), I just didn't seem to care or appreciate Harry's problems in this one. Point number two: the acting in this film was not up to snuff with the other two. There are I think two reasons for this. One, the ""bad"" guy Gary Oldman has virtually nothing to do or say. When he is on screen he gives one of his most boring, humdrum performances I ever seen from someone with his talent. Emma Thompson is wasted in her role as an instructor, and Michael Gambon has none of the charm Richard Harris gave to the Dummbledorf(?) role. There was no Jon Cleese cameo. Richard Griffiths has a very small role as Harry's bad uncle. Maggie Smith has maybe two lines. Why bother having her in the film? At least Alan Rickman and David Thewlis add some meat to this otherwise lean offering in terms of acting. The second reason is that the actors were not nearly as developed as they had been in the previous two films. Where was the tenderness between Harry and Dumbledorf? Daniel Radcliffe's angst over his parent's series of unfortunate events was not realistic nor was it even passably believable. Another thing that happens with child actors as they age is that much that they could get away with as younger children they cannot as they age. The cute factor or the believability factor decreases or in this disappears. What the film does have going for it are some well-shot action sequences with some impressive CGI effects. The game scene in the rain was especially breath-taking and the hippogryph was amazing. The movie is not bad, but, for me at least, it just doesn't conjure the same kind of magic the first Potter films did. Of course much of that change came with a new director with few legitimate screen credits to take on a project of this size. It is a bit darker in some ways, but the plot doesn't seem to be nearly as cohesive as the first two. I guess as its cast will not get any younger - I probably will never feel the same way about future Potter installments. Mouthy teenagers just don't seem to engage me at all but rather enrage me."
166,5,The Least of Potter Films So Far,"Harry Potter goes to Hollywood ... this movie is a two-hour-rush full of ""special"" effects. Large parts of it have the tempo of advertising or music videos. Alas, Harry Potter III lacks the charm of the books, it lacks the wonderful atmosphere of Old England so beautifully captured in the first two movies -- it lacks everything that made the previous films of the series something special, lovely. "
167,3,"Too much, too fast","The third film is the only one in which harry doesn't face up to the death threat, where voldemort never shows up, and the wandering dementors are an outward manifestation of inner fear. When faced with the boggart, the greatest fear is fear itself. In the face of fear, escape is useless, only true happiness, strong positive energy, can resist. There is no shame in acknowledging vulnerability, and one of the signs of not being strong enough is not being able to face up to it."
168,8,Face up and being strong,In these apocalyptic times I've started rereading all the books and following each with their respective film. There are a couple very important details in the book that would have given this film much more emotional depth.
169,7,Important details left out of the film that would have made it great rather than good.,"While travelling for his third year in Hogwarts, the grown-up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is advised that the criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards' Prison Azkaban. Sirius Black is blamed for being responsible for the death of Harry's parents and their best friend, Peter Pettigrew. In the train, Harry Potter faces an evil Dementor, sort of creature who drains good memories and life of their victims and which was sent to chase Sirius Black, but he is saved by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Once in Hogwarts, he realizes that the school is surrounded by Dementors, sent to protect Harry Potter and the students against Sirius Black. After many adventures, the truth is disclosed. Although being a good adventure, I found ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the weakest story of the trilogy. There are many situations used in the other two stories, like the game they play, or the bad treatment of Harry Potter's relatives, the character of Emma Thompson is too silly and not funny and Daniel Radcliffe does not correspond in some dramatic situations. Emma Watson, in the role of Hermion Granger, has another excellent performance. It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years. However, this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint. My vote is eight."
170,8,"Although Being a Good Adventure, It Is the Weakest Story of the Trilogy",This film has no sparkle to it. 
171,1,"Feels more like ""Three Go to Hogwarts"" - no magic.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a film directed by Alfosno Cuaron. I was curious before watching this film as many critics have noted this film a turning point in the series. After watching the film, I can say that this is by far my most favorite film of this series."
172,10,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Review,"Now that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his third year, he has new things with which to contend: Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and escaped prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), in jail for murdering Harry's parents."
173,10,thank God that changing directors didn't diminish the movie's quality,We all know the saying: third time lucky! Well this film is living proof of that.
174,10,Third Time Lucky,"Fans of the book (and I am an obsessed fan, I admit it) will be horrifically disappointed. The movie was not worth the money it took to make it. Actually, it wasn't even worth the overpriced movie ticket. A blistering failure from beginning to end. (Spoilers lie ahead) OK, a confession first: no one could ever possibly play Professor Lupin to my satisfaction. It's just simply not possible; I'm too emotionally invested in the character to accept any actor's interpretation, especially one who had never read the books. I knew before going into the theatre that I would hate the way they butchered my favorite character. But David Thewlis actually fell below my expectations. Not one thing about him was right, from that awful cheesy mustache to the watery blue eyes, to the cane he sauntered away withyes, I said a cane. Lupin would NEVER carry a cane. But just when I thought that they had ruined Lupin's physical appearance beyond all possibility, the actor had to open his mouth. Again, everything was wrong: the voice was wrong, the charm was gone, the sweet and patient honesty was nowhere to be found. They made this proud and unflinching noble character into a simpering pile of self-pity and fear. He couldn't even say Voldemort's name, nor make mention of his 'condition' by name. And please tell me why he spends his free time chatting with students in the Forbidden Forest? Meanwhile, I had hoped his appearance would improve after the transformation, but again I was sorely misguided. Considering the exorbitant amount of money they spent on those awful lake scenes and redressing (or should I say destroying) the set, they might have bothered to get an animal trainer. Instead, they created a CGI nightmare with no aesthetic relation to a wolf. But if I spend all my time discussing the way they ruined Lupin, I'll never get on to the rest of the horror. Everyone's favorite falsely accused murderer? Horrifying. Sirius would never have a menorah tattooed to his chest. And he certainly wouldn't spend his time lecturing Harry on the meaning of life when he had the chance to finally be free. After all, Harry would just tell him to stop kidding himself; Sirius has never exactly been the ideal role model. Oh, and why exactly would Padfoot *growl* at Harry? Then there's the cheesy Grim dog, which showed up everywhere without any actual meaning behind it. Or the Quidditch match that should never have been. I was angry about them cutting Quidditch; now I'm angry that they left it in. Michael Gambon was a horrible replacement. With all his acting experience, you'd think the director would bother telling him that Dumbledore has a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and that he would never say anything straight. Nor would Hermione, the empowered and scholarly (albeit bossy) role model, obsess over her hair, or wear anything preppy, trendy, and teenybopper-esque. But if I get started about Hermione, I'll *never* finish. The plot holes in this disaster were so large that several Mack trucks could be driven through them. Why the director decided that mentioning the authors of the Marauder's Map was a minor detail, I shan't understand. But leaving out the fact that James was an Animagus was just criminal. I won't even get into the ignored Quidditch win. The omission of the Firebolt, until the very end of the movie, and without Pig or the Hogsmeade form, was just stupid. Basically nothing was explained. Beyond that, every one of my favorite scenes was dramatically ruined. The boggart scene was abysmal; the Shrieking Shack was apparently cutting into those wonderful scenes with Buckbeak flying over the lake, so it was rushed and stupid. Oh, and they somehow left the Invisibility cloak out of the entire scene. But once Harry and Hermione went back with the Time Turner, I got fighting mad. It was overt, cheesy, melodramatic, inaccurate, and just plain stupid. Not one character behaved appropriately. Ever, in the length of the film. Well, maybe I should mention the one or two redeeming qualities that kept me from actually asking for my money back. Emma Thompson was surprisingly good, with her airy mysticism and dragonfly-like glasses. Daniel Radcliffe was just hot. And yes, I'm saying this and feeling like a pedophile. The Aunt Marge scene was pretty funny, and the Knight Bus was within the bounds of artistic license. Other than that, I give this film an enthusiastic two thumbs way, way down."
175,1,Don't waste your time,"Although POA might not be the best of the Harry Potter books, the movie managed to be my personal favorite of all the movies.<br /><br />Not only was the directing for the movie great, but the tone that the book managed to capture that the book did not was great. The movie felt more dark than the book, and managed to be suspenseful and entertaining from start to finish (something not all the movies can claim).<br /><br />Of course, the actors are wonderful and the story is one of the best the series has to offer."
176,10,The best movie in the series!,"Meant to update this a long while back. But the movie itself got me so de-motivated, that I didn't even bother to rank it. Some moments in the movie were good - but only thanks to CGI wizardry - nothing original at all in the movie or even the story! Total crap. If I did not care to give regards to the millions of HP-fans, I'd even rank it the lowest 1. The original HP movie was the best in the series, but only because it was new (-sort of) in its genre. All sequels just lack the depth. They only rely on visual tricks to awe the audience. All shine, no ground. This is a plain kids movie - kids who need little to get awed at. I can get equals thrills and probably indulge in more intelligence more whilst watching even Thirteen Ghosts."
177,2,Just did not click,"Yes, this movie bangs. I recently rewatched all the harry potter movies and i can say without a doubt that this one was my favorite. It was an amazing change of pace from the first two and kicked off right away. The first 30 minutes of this movie alone completely changed the mood of how the harry potter movies felt and i knew right away that i was about to have a blast watching this movie."
178,10,The best Harry Potter movie,"If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff (""Don't pull out his feathers,"" warns Hagrid, ""cause he won't thank yer for that!""). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration."
179,10,Something wicked this way comes,"One should never judge a book by its movie or vice versa, this makes rating ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" very difficult. Having read books one to five and being somewhat of a fan of the series, the movies naturally are always worse than the books. Rowling brings so many details, so many sidelines to the story which later reappear or converge to the final act. This and the sheer size of the books make the adaption for the cinema very difficult (perhaps a four-to-eight-hours-miniseries per book would be more effective)."
180,2,Not what you might expect from the book,"It's just the right point in the line of 7(8) pieces, the slow beginning of the dark, in all directions. The story gets intensified in many ways and the plot gets deeper. Our performers grow older and the first deeper steps into the history of magic are taken. The ties in our characters are more developed and naturally attuned to the environment of the more dangerous world."
181,10,My childhood love!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) is a movie I recently rewatcched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Harry finally deciding his aunt and uncle are not a family worth having and as he goes to school he is fully committed to his family at Hogwarts being what he can depend on. Meanwhile a prisoner has escaped the jail known as Azkaban who happens to be the man responsible for his parents death. This has led to Dementors, ghoul like creators, being everywhere around Hogwarts looking for the prisoner. Harry will look to make adjustments to his life while being hunted by the escaped prisoner and maybe someone else.."
182,10,This may be the best Harry Potter film and is definitely the best of the first three,"Everything that I disliked or criticized about the previous two Harry Potter films (which I absolutely didn't like) were masterfully done in the third installment of the series, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. Alfonso Cuaron's direction is a triumph  even scenes that I was cringing in anticipation over based on earlier CGI work, (the Quidditch match, the werewolves, etc.) were brilliant.  Overall, the film was a lot darker, a lot meatier, and had an exponential amount of style over its predecessors. Among the many amazing techniques that could be mentioned, Cuaron briefly introduces hand-held camera work, experimental use of color in various scenes, and best of all, not being a fan of the fantasy genre, steady pacing that never once allowed me to be bored.  "
183,8,Near perfection,Amazing film great director amazing acting great plot and easily the best Harry Potter film and its still on the mostly accurate to the books unlike some of the future films
184,10,Best film ever,"The PoA was my favourite book, with all of the underlying stories of the 4 mischief makers, but none of that was brought out here. There was so much scope for this movie but it failed to reach even close to it's potential."
185,7,Disappointed,"Does this series get better and better as everyone proclaims? Well, yes and, sadly no."
186,5,Something Wicked Finally Came,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan so naturally I went to see this pretty much the day it came out in Canada. I would say it's different, but still great. Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) did an excellent job of directing Dan, Emma and Rupert (Harry, Hermione and Ron respectively). Unlike in the previous two movies, Cuaron filmed these three in normal 'Muggle' clothes at times and not just in their robes."
187,10,Different...but still great. *SPOILERS*,"POA was by far the best of the three Harry Potter films. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have gained more confidence in their abilities. They have become more and more like the characters they play in their own life which has shown in the films."
188,10,Best film of the three so far!,This movie is an utter failure.
189,1,Failure,"I am a devout fan of the Harry Potter series, however, when I saw the Prisoner of Azkaban, needless to say, I was utterly disappointed."
190,1,Whatever.... This movie is so terrible it made me cry,"Although I did not read the book, it is obvious that something's wrong with this movie. In many aspects it is better that two prequels, but then again it leaves impression of weak movie, occasionally even boring. Acting, directing, production, special effects (especially hippogryf), everything is on high level and finale is great, but with story itself something definitely isn't right. Something's missing. Book fans surely know what I am talking about, even if I have no idea myself..."
191,7,Something's wrong,"I thought that this movie was a terrible waste of my time. There really wasn't a beginning and an ending, and I felt as if everything was rushed. The movie starts out with Harry sitting up in bed... DOING MAGIC! Underage wizards aren't allowed to do magic outside of school! Anyway, he does this about 5 times, then he lays back down and goes to sleep. With a blank screen, you hear his aunt shouting at him, but she doesn't sound anything like in the first and second movies. The next few shots are live-action, and very inaccurate to the book. Skipping to the ending... I honestly have to say that I am furious about the ending. Harry receives a broomstick in the mail, and flies with it. The movie ends when... he is flying on his broom in a pause-shot!? Honestly! The entire movie is BAD, and I really don't recommend it to anyone who has read the books. People who have just seen the movies... well that's just great because it doesn't make any sense. Okay, and just a warning, the dementors don't even have feelings in this movie (like they did in the book!!!)."
192,1,Terrible Overall,"Like Tim Burton did with Batman, Chris Columbus ""dumped"" the Harry Potter franchise after the first two movies. Luckily, his replacement, Alfonso Cuaròn, is no Joel Schumacher and the third Potter episode is no Batman Forever."
193,9,Darker and better: the Potter franchise keeps maturing,"I just finished watching all the Harry Potter films back to back to back to back. What a crazy trip. Before starting this review, here is my ranking, from best to worst:"
194,6,Overrated for sure.,"Wow. Before i saw this movie i said, ""after the first 2 movies and a better book to base this one off of, How could they go Wrong??"" Famous last words."
195,1,Not horrible,"For me this is the best 'Harry Potter'-film yet. The story is better, especially the ending, and the characters are really growing up in this one. 'Azkaban' is darker, scarier than the first two, making it more a grown up film. What also helps for that is director Alfonso Cuarón, known from the terrific 'Y Tu Mamá También', who gives the film a better look. The cinematography is more ""European"", if you can say that, and for me that makes the film better."
196,9,The best yet,"1. Not only is the scene where Harry receives the broomstick not in the beginning, but we see Harry practicing magic under his bedsheets. As shown by the second movie/book, practicing magic is not allowed outside Hogwarts. WTF? It's like they want me to hate the movie already."
197,7,"WOW!!!! Did we all watch the same movie... or better yet, read the same book?","I really cannot understand what's make so good to the critics this Harry Potter, it's the one of the worst movies I have seen this year (not so bad as Val Helsing). I know the cast and the acting is good, also is the soundtrack, but the story have nothing original and it's very predictable. Again we see Harry fighting VS the legacy of Voldemort who, as always, is trying to find a way to return. Only this time some new things of his past are revealed and a more sad Potter (but always the good guy, the same saint Potter of every book). Yeah, the story it's just a little more dark, with many monsters, but still too shallow, there's no real drama or realistic characters, as I said Potter is the same ""perfect"" good guy and the villains are always the baddest guys, for this reason he always receive special treatment (from the dumbledore and Hargrid, those who don't do it are the bad guys)to guarantee a forced happy ending, even when you know the next movie some little piece of the puzzle of Voldemort will appear. Some new elements have nothing new if you remember movies like Army of Darkness(the book of monsters) and the Frighteners(the dementors). I thought the end of the first movie was the worst I have seen in a film, but this one is the edge of stupidity. To those who want something more realistic and less shallow I recommend to read the masterpiece of Vertigo from DC comics ""The Books of magic"", and the Trilogy of books ""The Passing of the Technomages"", both have characters like Harry Potter, but the stories are very much better (in the trilogy of Technomage the first character have tragic past like Potter and even when is the hero of the story he never is well treated)"
198,1,Tragedy of poor saga,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the best trilogies to ever exist, it is a dark, murky, brooding film that takes the wizarding world in a scary direction that I don't think many of us were used to, and I love it for that."
199,9,Had me captured,"By now the series has found its sweet spot between dark and light, fear and wonder, childhood and adulthood, strangeness and convention. Cuaron is an excellent director who can seemingly turn his hand to any sort of film that comes his way, and as with every film in the series there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is only briefly seen but is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition and the introduction of the Dementors marks the arrival of one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-packed creations. It's trimmed some of the fat in comparison to the first two films, but is still a little too long - otherwise is probably the series at its peak."
200,9,The Series Hits Its Sweet Spot,This will be the definitive review for the movie.
201,1,Where is the magic? not in this movie!,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I felt this movie to be an absolute waste of my time and money. There was no closure, no regular plot movement, just random pieces of information from the book. Harry looked schizophrenic after they didn't include the explanation as to how Pettigrew was actually responsible for Harry's parents' deaths, instead of Black. Also, they cut the Quidditch matches from that year, except for the one between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff when the dementors arrived. Also, one other thing: the book clearly describes Patronuses as being able to move, so why weren't the ones in the movie? Honestly, the best parts of this horrible film were when the birds would fly too close to the whomping willow and turned into a shower of feathers."
202,1,Absolute garbage,This Harry has a new director in Alfonso Cuarón and a bit of a moodier look. The characters are also growing up and becoming teenagers now with a bit of angst. It all lends to a darker turn in this third installment that also sees the arrival of two fan favorite characters: Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. Brilliant acting by the new additions adds to the unique directing and makes this a turning point in the Harry Potter movies.
203,9,Harry is growing up,"I wasn't the biggest fan of this film's two predecessors, but I did enjoy this film. It's got it's fair share of problems mind you, but it also does quite a bit of things better than the previous ones did. The acting across the board is better, especially Emma Watson who isn't nearly as much of an insufferable hag in this one. The CGI continues to improve and the change in locations add a certain sense of splendor and majesty that the world desperately needed. It remains to be seen how I'll take to Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore as the series goes on but, as of right now, I'm miss Richard Harris in the role."
204,,"Finally, A Good One","I like the Harry Potter books and so far I've liked the Potter films. The casting's been excellent, the realizing of the world has been deftly done, and the movies by and large have retained the flavor of the books while being enjoyable in their own right. When Chris Columbus announced he wouldn't be helming the third one (or exhaustion would have killed him), I was concerned because more or less I felt he was the primary factor in why these films so readily translated the magic of the novels. And while he's still involved with the new film, you can definitely tell someone else is doing the driving."
205,5,Not as charming as the first two,"Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What can I say? Just don't go and see it.. OK? If you've read the book then you'll be outraged at how different and wrong it is and if you haven't then you won't have a clue what's going on and you will most likely fall asleep. Mind you, falling asleep in the nice warmth and comfort of a cinema may sound quite appealing to some what with the rush and business of every day life. I was thoroughly disappointed. I had already seen the first two films and not really enjoyed them much and with the new director I thought that this one might be different and might surprise me. I was surprised at how bad it was. The Lord of the Rings films are so much better in comparison as a novel-based film. I think they need a new, better director who has actually read the books and a new cast of people who actually know how to act. And really... the werewolf at the end was just awful. It looked like an over sized rat."
206,1,Oh dear,"Movies are challenging to make, everyone knows that. I offer my criticism as suggestions on how to improve the future films. "
207,,"A cry for help, what happened to emotional connection and tension? (spoilers)",Sorry to those who liked this film but i have to say that this film was disappointing. there were more bad things about this film than the good things. The good things about about this film were: 1. it was darker than the first two. they outlined the story in a dark way due to its background but that is not an enough of an excuse.
208,1,"Alfonso Cauron, go to hell",(some spoilers) If this HP movie has to be reviewed in one word that would be 'PITIFUL'. I think I was very soft the first time around giving it a 6/10. How the heck this is acclaimed the best of the 3 is just undigestable.
209,1,Azka-BAN this one!,"This movie is a disgrace to the series. The consistency issues in regards to the book and the first two films are readily apparent. Even to fans who have not read the books, the change in the geography of Hogwarts and how the characters dress are easily recognized as a break in continuity."
210,1,What a Disappointment,"Give up! Are the only words of support I can lend to the cast and crew. Dreadful translation from book to script and even more so from script to screen. The films get marked down time after time because Daniel Radcliffe makes a meal of it! An absolute travesty. He cannot act, he loves himself and he is so evidentially unable to act. He pulls the film down. He improves with practise and with each film but his performances are always dire. 1- Dreadful 2- Poor and 3- Below Average. 4 was probably- Below Average. By the next film he should be Average. He is improving but the quality and lack of passion in his performance was a dread and a bore, quite frankly so get some acting tips and and use them."
211,2,Give up!,"I thought this was an undistinguished entry in the series, and I'm surprised at all the good reviews. The most annoying thing was that they changed the location of the filming; Hogwarts, Hagrid's house, and the Whomping Willow were all located in different places from the previous movies and thus looked very different. The credits say it was filmed partly in Scotland, which probably accounts for the change. While the essence of the plot was intact, the pacing was slow. The best part of the movie was the Marauder's Map, which was shown throughout the final credits. While the acting was good and it was well cast, none of the new characters matched Kenneth Branagh's performance in the last film. All in all, this was a major disappointment."
212,4,Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, regarding my summary comment, I don't begrudge any of the money made off the Harry Potter books and now movies. Harry Potter was a good idea and few people in the history of literature have been able to create such interesting characters and stories. What I mean is, after the first movie there isn't much new. We see the continuing story of Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts, supported by a cast that includes many of the best British actors. The movies are done in a style that makes it clear they are fantasy, so even when the protagonists are ""in danger"", wink-wink, we know that they aren't really in danger. because we know that Harry Potter and his friends will always prevail."
213,,Interesting to watch the money-making machine march forward.,It was a really strong movie. An incredibly interesting story. The characters are in place for us. The finish was also great. The stories that deal with Time are really interesting.
214,10,Incredibly attractive,"I probably agree with those who claim this is the best movie of the franchise. I can't explain why I just do. I probably watched it more than the others and the read the book more times than the others. The story is good and there's a plot twist, scary yet not too scary, and the kids I find them more relatable. Of course, adore Hermione punch Malfoy-- love her. And the Time Turner is cool."
215,10,My favorite book and movie of the series,"Alfonso Cuaron was a very bad choice of directors. I just saw this movie today, and it was very bad. I read the book a few years ago, and I thought it was great. But everything that made the book great just seemed to be gone in the movie. I can't even put my finger on it. I think it's because of the change in directors. Alfonso Cuaron seems like a very artistic and gimmicky kind of director to me, and has no sense of story telling. Christopher Columbus told the story better, and made good movies out of it. They didn't omit anything major, and the movies ended up being wonderful. But Alfonso Cuaron cut out some of the best parts of the book, as well as the most important parts (like explaining how Sirius Black knew Peter Pettigrew was at Hogwarts, or even explaining how Sirius Black was wrongfully accused of Peter's murder). One of the worst parts of the movie is the end. It was all wrong. The Firebolt being received was a terrible way to end the movie, and it wasn't even explained who gave it to him. We never get the heartwarming letter from Sirius to tell Harry (and the audience!) that Sirius did indeed make it to safety, and that he wasn't attacked by Dementors (who can fly????) or something on his way to the mountains. There were obviously a lot of omissions from the story, and one must wonder why, when they could have put most of them in, and the movie could have been like 3 hours long, like it should have been. I don't know what they were thinking by making the movie only 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie seemed so rushed, and incomplete. "
216,,"If you liked the first two movies, or the books, you won't like this movie.","This third Harry Potter movie is different from the previous two movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker and much more mature but not better than its predecessors."
217,7,Different but not necessarily better.,"It feels like a transition movie, as the books become darker, obviously their celluloid counterparts will follow suit. But this film doesn't feel that dark, yet still managed to be less magical and less fun then the previous two films. Granted with ""Chamber of Secrets"", the bar was sat extremely high, but this film is definitely missing Chris Columbus's touch. The good acting is there (Gary Olman is great in damn near everything), the good special effects are there, and it's nice to see Rupert Grint growing into his own skin a bit and not looking so weird looking. The substance so much displayed in the first two isn't there, the heart isn't there (not in the same degree at least). This is not to say the the third film isn't good, I DO like it. It's just the worst of the three and I'm glad that Alfonso Cuarón isn't directing the next film ""Goblit of Fire"", as his eye is obviously meant for more pretentious Art-house cinema."
218,7,third time's not the charm,SCORE: 9.6/10
219,10,They need to start background checking their Teachers of Defence Against the Dark Arts,"Being the third of seven, this chapter took a whole different direction from the world established by the first two directed by Chris Columbus. Some might criticize the different style but I was entertained. And the chemistry between the main characters worked nicely. I don't care what anyone else says; this was one of the better Harry Potter films. It may have skimped on some of the scenes but it was entertaining for those who wanted a darker tale. It might be like The Empire Strikes Back of the Harry Potter franchise, but this is modern fantasy plain and simple."
220,8,Harry Potter takes a darker turn,"The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous."
221,8,Y Alfonso Cuaron tambien!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series so far. This is because it takes the strengths of the previous movies (the score, cast, and source material) and unites them with artistic filmmaking. Clearly, Alfonso Cuarón is a directorial step up from Chris Columbus. The imagery is more beautiful because of dramatic lighting, intentional composition, and ambitious camera movement. Meanwhile, there are stylish scene transitions complete with thematic meaning. Lastly, the settings and locations have more depth, which finally worldbuild like the franchise had always strived for. All together, this produces a film that has artistic undertones rather than just light family entertainment."
222,8,The peak film of the franchise,"Did Rowling have to write another ""Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban"" for the film? It certainly has some likeness to the book, I'll say that much. In fact, there was some scenes after the werewolf that were what I had imagined it to be from the book, though that's nearly the end of the film. The rest of it, however was comprised of a rewritten story or highlights from parts of the book not shown in the movie. What did they film then? I guess you could say they showed enough highlights in the story that when piecemealed together, made it a movie. But there are some things in the movie that they touched only lightly on that never had any explanation in the film. Who is Messrs Moony Wormtail Padfoot & Prongs? Well okay, I guess if you watch the movie, you just think it's another Rowling name for a group of mischievous wizards. You'd never consider that Moony is Lupin the werewolf, Wormtail is Pettigrew the rat, Padfoot is Black the dog and Prongs is Potter the Pronghorn. Nor would you consider at that point, they were old school chums. What was the big deal about the Firebolt? Well if you just watched the movie, you'd think it was just an equivalent replacement to Harry's splintered nimbus 2000. You'd never hear about it at the beginning of the story and how it might be enchanted with charms or curses when he gets it before the second gryffindor quidditch match and has to ride an old worn-out broom. In fact, you would never know that he got to ride it on the third quidditch match and take home the quidditch cup at the end. At least in the chamber of secrets, the only major cut they made was Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party. But it seemed such a shame that they use such a wonderful actor to play Sir Nicholas only to take away his moment in the story. I am certain that people who have not read the book will find the movie quite interesting, yet somewhat puzzling. For the readers of this story, you may have also found it disappointing."
223,4,The third movie is even less like the book than the second...,"Yes, I know that if the director went about making the movie an exact copy of the book, the movie would be over 4 hours long. But then again, you can't condense a movie to the point where it looses its entire essence just to keep it within 2 hrs 20 mins."
224,3,Highly disappointing to anyone who read the book.,"I rarely comment on movies, but the stupid backlash against this film by book purists is really making me angry, and I wanted to give them all a good, sound lecture. And I'm just as big a Harry Potter fan as any of you; and yes, Azkaban is my favorite book; and yes, I could quote you verbatim from almost any section of the book. So don't just sneer and dismiss what I'm about to say."
225,,Lovely . . . book purists get off your high horses.,"As the trio gets older the films become a little darker and more mature. Watching the Harry Potter series within days of each other can be a tough adjustment. Especially considering how family friendly the first two installments are, but no matter the subtitle, Harry Potter films always maintain that fun atmosphere."
226,8,"Cuarón Brings a More Mature, Stylistic Approach to the Series",Alfonso Cuarón claims that the film didn't need to be 3-4hrs long; well I have to admit he may be correct; the only problem is he forgot to explain what the hell was going on?
227,1,Cuarón was just showing off...,"The previous two film were still very solid and did a great job establishing the characters and their world, but this film really is the high point of not just the first trilogy but of the series as a whole."
228,10,This is the high point,*spoilers*
229,,A disappointing Sequel,(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS)
230,8,"The darkest of the bunch...and the best, so far","It seems that this third part of the Harry Potter movie sequel is not part of the sequel at all. Its entirely farfetch from the book and the new director even have some fun doing the changes. I am very frustrated by this movie, and my wait hasn't been paid off. My expectations were too far from what i saw on the screen and the new director failed me. It thought this would be a better movie from the two. well, i think JK should be more strict the next time her book is being filmed and see to it that is depicts the events from the books even just a 50 percent from it."
231,,don't tell me they based it from the book!,"1. This movie is the worst of the three. 2. The director decided to create a whole new set for the movie....So Hogwarts changes between year two and year three. 3. The firebolt scene is so cheezy, what is he playing at, this is not some cheap B-rated crap he is filming in Mexico, this is a million dollar production, at least take some filmography classes or something. 4. The filming is horrible, completely like a home-video type thing. The camera was too close to the characters. 5. The director also americanized the movie too much....where are the uniforms....they do not go prancing about the school in casual wear. 6. Who gave the director permission to change such large chunks of the script. Skip some scenes, thats OK....but do not change the damn story. 7. The director also rushed the dialogue. These people are English...and when the English speak (properly that is) they speak slowly so it can be understood....not the rushing that he was telling his actors to do. "
232,1,This Movie is not worth the money,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was amazing. I highly recommend this movie. It was darker and much better than the first two movies.
233,10,I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!,"Harry Potter is a fantasy movie, based on a book, directed by David Yates. We can see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The special effects are really realistic, and costumes match the characters.If you like magic, it is well worth seeing."
234,9,fantasy movie,"Okay, now I understand that everyone is all ""oh, thank goodness they didn't stick so close to the book"" in this movie, but may I say that: a. They weren't that close in the first two b. Who the heck are you kidding?? The similarities with the book I could count on one hand."
235,1,What the heck???,"Someone who hasn't read the book might say this is a good movie or even the best Potter movie ever. But anyone who knows the book will surely be disappointed by it. The most scenes happen in another time, another place, with other persons than or have never took place in the book. But even worse than that is that Hogwarts has become another castle and even the Hogwarts grounds, in the first 2 movies flat and wide are now in mountain style. So where is the continuity in the continuation? In my opinion the movie is really awful! But there is hope for the next one, the Director will be another than this time. Let's hope he has read the books before he starts his work."
236,1,A Potter movie not for Potter fans,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan that has been looking forward to this movie ever since the credits finished rolling for Chamber of Secrets. To say that I am disappointed in this film is a huge understatement. I shall start with the characters. The two most fascinating and powerful characters in the books and first two movies outside of the three kids are Snape and Dumbledore, Snape is reduced to a seldom used butt of a joke and Dumbledore has completely lost his magnificent presence and aura and is closer to a doddering old man. One of the most effective parts of the first two movies is the magical settings and costumes, these are completely missing from this movie. Hogwarts looks shabby and stark, Hagrids Hut more closely resembles a redneck trailer home. The students spend most of their time in street clothes, the entire 'feel' of the movie is more like a cheap imitation of 'Lord of the Rings' than the wonderful settings from the first two movies. However the most disappointing part of the movie is its plot/storyline... While the first two movies brought the books to life in a vivid and spectacular fashion with a faithful presentation Prisoner of Azkaban is a choppy, mutilated version of the book, completely lacking the engrossing nature of the book. Many important elements of the book were completely overlooked or 'changed'. The most important omission to me was the lack of any explanation of the significance of 'Padfoot, Mooney, Prongs and Wormtail and their relationships. Also the book introduced Cedric Diggory as the Hufflepuff seeker that beat Harry and brought about a level of animosity toward him by the Griffyndors... Cuaron seemed to approach POA with an intent to make it a combination of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Men in Black' it was a complete failure..."
237,1,A Review,It was fine but not as good as the first two movies. The movie did have good ideas
238,6,Azkaban,"My favourite of the books, and certainly one of the strongest films in the series, Azkaban heralds an even darker new vision, as our three heroes are faced with an escaped murderer. Cuaron brings a maturity to the film that parallels the now-teen cast. Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black and the final third of the film is a masterclass in fantasy filmmaking. 9/10."
239,9,Masterclass,Wow.
240,9,Somehow deserves the hype,"I saw all Harry Potter movies in the cinema upon their release, and Azkaban stuck with me the most. The combination of actors in their respective roles, and seeing them collide off each other is brilliant, especially the scene between Snape, Remus, Sirius and Pettigrew."
241,10,Best of the series,"The camera angles on this make this a true masterpiece and make this all the more amazing! The clock tower shows up so much in the film showing the plot with Time Turners (which appeared later) is amazing since Hermione used it with Harry to go back in time to save Buckbeak and Sirius. The only thing that's bad about this, but it's only small. The fact that Harry is using magic outside of school seems weird since he isn't of age in the Wizarding World yet it's such a masterpiece and Alfonso (the director) should've gotten an Oscar for his filmmaking skills for the film. Also it does seem weird for Dumbledore, the smartest and most powerful wizard ever TOUCH RON'S BROKEN LEG! It's so unlike Dumbledore and I don't know why he had to do this as Ron reacted in a super painfully way and Dumbledore should've known it would hurt Ron and would make him cry out in pain."
242,10,A cinematic masterpiece,"This is not a good movie, it is a result of excellent marketing. The tricks and effects are good but then the best films would be about theater magicians and illusionists. Does not even worth renting. Most of the effects are a repetition of the previous ones. Hopefully, the probability of a Harry IV are very thin, thanks to the fact that everyone grows up, as in this movie the aging of faces and ideas clearly shows up. A hint to film lovers: A big part of the overall success of the Harry Potter phenomenon seems to be the absence of anything deep enough to think or debate."
243,1,Thank god the main actors have grown up,"i think the idea of changing the director (chris columbus-:HP-1 & HP-2)has completely demented that sensitivity,emotionality and of course its incomparable MAGIC from its formal versions.Alfonso is indeed a very good director but(and there's always a BUT)he does'nt seems to be feet on columbus shoe.Many changes are followed in this film from that of the BOOK."
244,1,Its a good film but nothing compare to their predecessors,"This isn't my favourite story of the franchise - there are a few flaws with the Peter Pettigrew/Scabbers twist (why did Wormtail hide in such an obvious place, for example), and whilst I do like that Voldemort isn't included in any kind of physical form, you could essentially remove this film from the storyline and not that much would change. But this is definitely the most well made film of the franchise. Alfonso Cuaron is a great director, and his use of long takes as well as darker cinematography makes this a visual treat from start to finish. Whilst I would consider Goblet of Fire to be the first truly dark film in the franchise, this is definitely leaning towards that whilst keeping a lot of the fun aswell. The score is arguably the best in the franchise, Lupin is a great addition, the relationship between Sirius and Harry, despite them spending very little time together, is extremely well developed when they are on screen together, Snape has a great arc in this film - it's just the best made of the franchise by far. The performances from the lead three are finally legitimately good, and the effects are once again a big step up from Chamber of Secrets. I love the use of time travel here, which can feel like an excuse to change the past, but is used in the way that time travel would actually work in real life. The relationships between the characters are really well developed on the whole - I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love this film. As much as I love the rest of the franchise, I can't help but wonder what Cuaron would have done in the rest of the franchise, because he clearly shows here that he is a master of his craft. In conclusion, this is my favourite of the rewatch so far, and I would definitely recommend it."
245,9,The Best in the Series so far,"Our family are avid Harry Potter fans, and to say that this installment of the series left us wondering what happened to the Harry Potter style is an understatement. There was so much important information left out of The Prizoner of Azkaban we wondered if it was the same story. Our oldest child who has read all five books several times (even out of order), and our second child who has also read them several times, were telling us what important things were excluded that lead into the fourth installment. "
246,5,This Harry Potter didn't meet expectations.,"To start off with, when I say this review may contain spoilers, I'm not kidding. It's what makes the film great, I'm talking about it for a quarter of this short review. So be warned! I admit that the actors did well, but it's the spoilers that make this movie. Here we go!"
247,9,It's probably one of the best.,"It is said that all knowledge comes from introspection. If viewed from the original novel, the movie's screenplay is very incomplete. Given, it is a story about magic! But its explanations as to how many of its important events occurred are impoverished. First and foremost, Mr. Black's escape from the prison of Azkaban isn't explained. Nor is how Miss. Granger came to be in possession of a time-travel device called a time-turner. In retrospect, the primary theme of the entire movie amounted to the belief that Mr. Black wanted Potter dead. Moving on, the production of the film was very good. The special effects captured the events as I expect the writer Rowlings intended. The performance of the actors was sufficient, but not great. Well, whoever plays Granger is nearly as annoying as the fictional one in the original text. The guy who plays Snape is also nearly as creepy as the fictional one. The beginning of the film is excellent, and quite hilarious. It also seemed as if the entire story could have been told in a film three quarters as long, including the omissions as mentioned above. Overall, I give it a 8 out of 10."
248,8,Above Average Except For Plot Exceptions,"My first review of a movie. And I think Azkaban deserves a great 8/10. Just great entertainment, based on one of my favorite books."
249,8,The third act of this movie is the best of the whole HP series,"Another rating point above part two, so a solid 9 for me. This is my favorite movie of all four of the series. There are basically two main reasons for that. The time-travel sequence had me on the edge of my seat, I was stunned by the complexity and the brilliancy of how this aspect was presented, how it fitted to the scene before and how it was generally linked. That made it for me. The second reason was the complex storyline, in particular the new character of Mr. Lupin, Harry's teacher, and the way he and Sirius Black turned into animals as one of the movies highlights. Also the map of the castle with the mysterious footprints was just utter genius! Harry's fight against the ""Dementor""-guys was a very powerful sequence, when you consider him being emotionally so much involved here, when he created that shield with the memories of his parents. When I look into Harry's eyes there, I can almost feel how much he struggles with his fear and how powerful his magical skills are. Again, my favorite of the series. Just think of the wonderful animal Harry and Hermione save, what an eye-catcher."
250,8,Highlight of the series,"This is the only HP movie to come out so far that I actually disliked. The biggest problem are the many unnecessary changes that Cuaron makes only becuase he wants to. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the Trivia section here at IMDB. There are two items listed as being ""In honor of Alfonos Cuaron's Mexican Heritage"" and not one but TWO director's cameos. More than anything that shows that Cuaron was more interested in himself than the work at hand."
251,1,Less a Harry Potter movie than an homage to Alfonso Cuarón,"I'll simply say, the story was full of holes like a piece of swiss cheese... there was no feel or sense of danger, darkness, anticipation, worry or magical enchantment as the other's possessed before it."
252,5,"Weak, Un-Enchanting","I went into this movie aware of the fact that the 3rd book was a bit darker and different than the first two, but I still came out disappointed. (And FYI, I haven't read any of the books, so please excuse my inability to compare.)"
253,6,Somewhat lacking,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite of the books so far but right off the bat, I have some mixed feelings about the movie. There are some huge differences between this film and the previous installments and that's not necessarily for the best. Let's begin..."
254,,An interesting take on the third installment in the Harry Potter saga,"Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, brings the usual assorted hazards, challenges and life-threatening scrapes we've come to expect from this series. This time Potter is under threat from Sirius Black, an escapee from Azkaban Prison., who is apparently intent on murdering our hero and prematurely ending one of the most successful film series of all time. Along the way Harry must also face the frightening Dementor (the spectral guards of Azkaban Prison), get the better of Draco Malfoy, and save Hagrid's new pet from a sticky end."
255,7,Returns to Hogwarts,I don't know how people rate this film 9 !!! And not what I expected
256,1,Waist of time,"when i read the book, i had a vision of images fleeting fluidly one after the other. however, when i saw the movie, i felt violated. it's like i was seeing something else in my mind's eye and the movie version was garishly disparaging my vision. prof trelawny, whom i envisioned to be statuesque and fluid, although a little eccentric, came across in the movie as just flaky. even the dementors were disjointed. the knight bus was too full of itself to come across as a wizard's chief means of transportation -- it was to glitzy. not only that, the acting, from the first movie, to this installment is getting worse. what's with this? harry potter is a good book. but Hollywood is intent of just cashing in on a good thing and ruining it (turning it into a Hollywood production, full of glitz, lacking in substance). i was just disappointed. i'd rather read the book again and again."
257,1,read the book!,"The darkest film yet, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful film. As a big fan of all Harry Potter related things, I loved this film but, only because it was Harry Potter related. As almost all films, it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages. I must say, that the director this time outdid himself, as the visual effects are no less than fantastic. The dementors, the scenery in general and the outside ambiance, especially Hagrid's hut are really fascinating. The village of Hogsemead is really cute and just as I expected it to be. What really disappointed me, probably disappointed most who are big fans of J.K Rowling's books. The film gave great importance to visual effects (if i might add fascinating ones, especially the computer animated hippogriff, Buckbeak) but almost ignored the whole story and its essence. Certain funny comments and situations were eliminated from the film, such as the Dementor/Malfoy situation in the Quidditch Game and Harry's crush on Cho Chang. The Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book was really emotional and although, true Harry Potter fans did find their eyes watering at the some point in the film, I must say that I almost tore the book's pages with my crying. The whole story of the Maurauder's map is almost deleted entirely and that, in my opinion is not good, as it is a very special part in the book. I really must say that the previous two films were more faithful to the story. But, who am I to comment on such things? After all, J.K Rowling did work entirely with the screen writer, so she, of all people, should know what is important and what's not relevant to future films. Still, I think that certain special moments mean the world to Harry Potter fans, who probably, have lost count of the number of times they had seen the film."
258,9,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Until this day I belive that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of Harry Potter movies. Many secrets revealed. We can now take a closer look at the lessons and the wizarding world. In addition, we learn more characteristics of each character and their psychosynthesis. Last but not least, we have the entry of my favorite character, Sirius Black, in the story."
259,10,Best Harry Potter movie,"This new director did a great job making a movie with a lot of flash and no bang. He did not just CUT things out of the movie but he made HUGE changes to the wizarding world. I will list some of them now. Opening scene Harry is trying to cast a spell under his sheets (a spell that is not even in the books) but DARN in the books its HIGHLY illegal for wizards not of age to be casting spells outside school (let alone in a MUGGLE neighborhood). A huge change that I saw were FLYING dementors, in the books they just hover over the ground...in the movie he has them chasing him like airplanes...zooming all around. In the book they had to list the ways of telling a werewolf from a normal wolf...no where did I hear ""Long thin legs"", in the books a werewolf looks VERY much like a normal wolf (other then a few things like eyes and snout length). In the books there is only ONE time you will catch a wizard in muggle clothes...and thats when he is in a MUGGLE town. In the movie they almost NEVER wear cloaks or robes and thats after JK Rowling did a GREAT job telling us what each of these wizards normally wear. The first two movies followed the book great, it was like reading every other page. This movie was like a friend reading the third book and then a year later trying to tell you what happened. (huge changes in the plot) I'm a avid fan but this movie hurt more then it helped."
260,1,Butchered,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a beautiful movie that perfectly encapsulates the wizarding world in which a constantly engaging story unfolds. The new director brought to the table was an amazing choice and not only did the CGI and cinematography improve to the ""good"" range, but the bad acting present in the first two films of the series is now almost completely gone."
261,,One of (if not) the Best!,"I see that I am not the only one to feel that this movie was a let down compared to the first two. Even though the first two movies may have been more child like, the movies where close in context to the book. Like Nara from Japan, I agree that the move seemed rushed and confusing, even to those who have read the books. I went with many people who had never read the books and they where not excited but still commented it was good. I wish the producers/director would have not changed the setting as much and not have changed how the children where represented (the students wore ""muggle clothes"" instead of wizards clothes and other details that made it what makes the book so great). Overall the more I watched the movie the more I understood it but I have read the book and listened to it on audio tape. The darkness topic just goes with the theme, as evil gets stronger, the darker the books are going to get until evil is defeated. As the Potter gang gets older and so do the subjects. It will then be according to the parents of the children watching the movie to determine if the children are mature enough/ understand enough to be watching the movie. That is why parents should supervise their children when they watch movies. The books are by far 20xs better and I would recommend reading them to your kids before watching the movie so your kids won't be so surprised about the theme."
262,4,liked the first two better,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The plot is relatively the same as the first two and puts you to sleep and the acting hasn't improved one bit, which is hard not to improve. The entire movie was horrible. I did not enjoy myself once sitting through it as it just drags on and on without an end. I felt like I was sitting through the first two all over again, it's the much alike in the story. The only part unique about this one than the other two was the cinematography/directing, which were both horrible. This movie was absolutely boring, although I didn't expect better coming from the books. Don't let your children see this mindless crap, it's awful."
263,1,Horrible,"Finally a Harry Potter film that seems like a real film. The two first movies, directed by Chris Columbus, weren't bad, but seeing them without having read the books was a confusing, and sometimes boring experience."
264,,Cuarón really knows how to do a Potter movie,"Rowling's books, given their references to: English boarding schools; the problems of life in (apparently mundane and, at times, abusive) suburban and middle-class English life; the acquisition of knowledge regardless of cost; the shifting and unreliable input of adults per se; and, surely, the need for a child to believe in the sanctity of missing parent(s), were always going to be problematic when transferred to the ""big/silver screen""."
265,9,School Daze and Knowledge,"Not the best Harry Potter. Here are a couple of reasons, well first, they took out way too many scenes, second, they arranged them in totally different orders and changed the whole story. I agree with some of these comments, because they should get a Director that actually READ the book. Not a Director who just gets the main plot and changes the whole book. The first Harry Potter was far more better than this one because that one at least GOES with the book. All the Harry Potter movies are always missing something very important. In this one, they took out the other Quiddich Match. That's where he ACTUALLY got his Firebolt and beat Ravenclaw. Oh, and they shouldn't change the scenery, that wasn't so smart because everything looks all different."
266,4,"Not so great,",Prisoner of Azkaban is Special in HP series it was way Before it's time and movie with its Darker tone is another plus point to people who say it's For child and no word to say in Action Department and Movie Screenplay was excellence and Takes our Journey to new chapter.
267,9,Glorious,"My opinion of the recently released Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is that the new director totally changed the mood and feeling of the Harry Potter series. Those of you who watched PoA and read the book saw many things cut out, I am aware that a lot had to be cut out for time reasons but in doing this many things were lost that were important in the storyline. An Example of this is how Heromine was able to attend all her classes this was shown briefly in two scene and could have easily been missed. Another thing that was troubling was why was the scenery of the movie changed. The grounds of Hogwarts were totally different than the first two movies.I believe that the change of director could have turned off many Harry Potter fans from the movies. As for myself I enjoyed the first two films and did not like the third. I do very much though enjoy the books and also I hope that the the next movie will be a little better put together."
268,1,Don't like the change of director,"One of, if not the best of the film adaptations which is inevitably a result of the esteemed director. The plot also takes a much darker turn with the ever looming threat of Sirius Black (which in very typical HP fashion isn't a bad guy) and the introduction of dementors changes the tone of things. The plot remains consistently interesting throughout the film with a gripping conflict towards the end of the film. Unfortunately Rowling decides to use a bit of a dangerous plot device with the time turner, a device like that could probably be used for a greater purpose than Hermione attending multiple classes."
269,8,Harry Potter and the best of the bunch,"I think and i know (:)) that... It was brilliant idea to invite Alfonso Cuaron. Perfect directing and book ADAPTATION. Not copy, but adaptation. 1st of all. Harry's Hair. Hermione's Hair, The Leacky Cauldron, Knight Bus etc etc etc. I saw Harry Potter World on the Screen, each detail of it, like chairs in The Leacky Cauldon or a knight walkin' from picture to picture on the background. Yes, i didn't see Harry Potter's 3rd book on 100%. I didn't see a story about animages, and Gambon as Dumbledore not so ""dumbledored"", but i see life in his eyes(sorry about Harris, but i need to say that). If u red ""Albus Dumbledore's Big Game"" - huge Russian theory about Harry Potter books, u will see that Gambon is those ""gamer"". Also, i saw atmosphere of HP. Movie - is not a book. I think it's stupid to read a book on the screen. I can read it in my armchair with cup of tea. I want to see a World. I want to see all, what i can only imagine by reading. And i saw it only in Cuaron's film. And it's cool. Thank you Alfonso, for realism and perfect book ADAPTATION."
270,10,Top-1 of Harry Potter Films.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004):<br /><br />The third Harry Potter film is widely regarded as one of the best in the series, and for good reason. Director Alfonso Cuaron takes the reins and brings a darker, more atmospheric tone to the story, while also exploring the complex emotions and relationships of the characters. The film introduces Sirius Black, played brilliantly by Gary Oldman, and delves deeper into the backstory of Harry's parents. The film also features stunning visual effects and a haunting score by John Williams. While the film may deviate from the source material in some ways, it still captures the spirit of the books and sets a high standard for the rest of the franchise."
271,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004):,"Except for the childish nonsense of the bus in the beginning, it's the most entertaining entry of the three I've seen-the first three. It's also the most darker and adult. This new refreshing air is worth, above all, of the technicians and, also enough, of the Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón."
272,7,A new darker and adult style,"Hope you have read the book because the movie plot is so full of holes it is very hard to figure out what is going on. Don't get me wrong, I liked some of it. But as a whole the movie sucked. It was like taking the book and slicing it into 1/4. The movie didn't explain enough and left out a lot of powerful, interesting scenes and information. Seriously, that was how long the movie seemed. Actually within the first three minutes I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I left angry. I can understand people saying that one must always expect things to be left out of the book when making a movie, why then stick in a whole bunch of slapstick instead of major plot points?"
273,1,What a clueless movie,"Cuarón was a way better choice compared to Columbus! Columbus' versions were clearly meant more for kids than (young) adults, but Cuarón knows how to make a film truly for the whole family. Prisoner of Azkaban is of course scary for kids, but not too terrifying, yet still thrilling for anyone older. "
274,8,Exceeds the two previous movies,"I went to a NYC Screening of this movie and all I have to say is Wow. I didn't know if the movie would be better than the first two or not but Alfonso Cuaron did the movie just as good if better. I recommend going to see this move. As always Dan, Rupert, Emma, and Robbie play there parts well but I was surprised about how good David Thewlis played Lupin he was awesome and was meant for the role. Gary Oldman played Sirius well but he looked a little too old for the part but who cares anyway. Micheal Gambon was just as good as Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Emma Thompson was great as Prof. Trelwany. I recommend again to go see this movie."
275,10,WOW THIS MOVIE TOTALLY Surprised ME!!!!!,"For a film dealing with wizardry and witchery this film is totally lacking in any kind of magic. Instead the screen is filled busy busy busy with twitching, flying, and whirring CGI gimmicks and whizbangs The whole movie is layered so deep, and cluttered up with special effects that there is precious room for anything else."
276,2,Show me the Magic!,This movie could have been cut down to at least an half an hour. The new director was more concerned in putting CGI in this movie than getting to the storyline. Moments of pure boredom. Christopher Columbus is missed.
277,5,Boring,"Best one of the series, I loved this one, This one took Harry Potter in a whole new direction"
278,10,Best one yet,"I've seen this movie so many times, until I turned 15 (2006) and I loved it every time! Of course, back then I was watching it for the story. I'm seventeen right now and almost forgot I am still a teenager. This movie reminds me of so much in my life, because every time I watched it, I was sad or angry and it always helped me distract and then concentrate on a solution."
279,10,~*-Harry Potter and Alfonso Cuarón-*~,"This movie was disgraceful to the great work of JK Rowling. There were countless errors not to mention key parts of the plot were missing. The acting was at best decent, though if the film had one up side it was Hermione (Emma Watson) she really was very good. I left the theater laughing at this horrible attempt at a movie. Next time please stay more loyal to the book. By far this movie was the worst of the three and I didn't think the first two were very good. The special effects were alright but I spent so much time distracted by the mistakes I couldn't enjoy this movie."
280,4,"WORST OF THE THREE, AND THATS SAYING SOMETHING.","As with the other HP movies and one of the main reasons that adults mostly have distaste for this series is that there is really no mystery or feeling in these films. A perfect example is the bus ride in the beginning. The driver is a complete moron, and you would think that witches and wizards would have a higher standard than the humans whom they always make fun of. But it's the fact that the bus can't just be a bus, with a interesting conductor,etc. It has to travel at a ridiculous speed where everyone is flying around driven by a half blind guy, people actually sleep though it and Harry is treated like crap. Why would you want to be a part of this? Is it funny, no. Is it creative, no. Wouldn't it be easier to just drive the bus in a normal way then have to squeeze it and everyone in it to go between two other buses while going the wrong way???"
281,4,ZZZ More of the same,"I loved Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ; this movie was not as childish as the others, and Alfonso Cuaron did a great job. I love the fact that it is darker than the other ones and the characters are more mature (haven't read the book.. i guess in the book it is like that). The only think I didn't like was some of the effects that seemed so fake considering the mega budget for a HP film. They really have to improve on it, specially on the animals. And there were some shots, specially in the ones when Hermione is held by the tree that look so horrible and in the room you could hear a big laugh for the horrible shot."
282,10,Almost perfect.,"Whilst it's much improved after the excruciatingly slow pace of The Chamber of Secrets, the third Harry Potter chapter will definitely receive terrible ratings from fantasy haters. It's even to the first two instalments, including plenty of magic and prolonged excitement. But Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is flat, uninteresting and entirely ridiculous."
283,5,It's Enough for Harry Potter Fans,"This is in no way as good as the previous two films. Granted it was a larger book, but where is the logic in adding new scenes when the time could be spent explaining who, what, when, how and why. Important facts were left out that are used in later books which are larger, so how are they going to fit it all in?"
284,,Big Disappointment,My quest of watching the entire series of the Harry Potter movies continued with the 3th chapter: The Prisoner of Azkaban.
285,10,another interesting story,"I hate the new direction. Harry Potter is supposed to be MOSTLY for kids. But now movie 3 has become an artsy-fartsy German indie film. I hate that; there were too many shadows and the black-out was way over-used. I mean, there ARE other screen transitions."
286,3,Damn art films,"This movie is so fresh... it flows easily are sprinkled with nice humor and is full of creative touches, the music is good, hell even the kids (especially Emma Watson) are good (well... Radclife is passable) and the direction is nothing short of mind blowing."
287,9,a glimpse of what could have been...,"It took me years to warm up to this movie as this one brought a whole new look to the series, I struggled at first to enjoy but after so many years I have finally warmed up to it and boy it's fun and action packed and has a lot of rememberbal scenes like the knight bus which I like the knight bus but I do still prefer the flying ford angila 105e, Sirius black is such a fantastic character at first he came across as a psych but after wards you realise he is a good guy the whole time, the scene location is fantastic being filmed in Scotland is just brilliant, the camera quality is just amazing making it look so real and the cgi effects are fantastic so huge improvement over the first film, which the cgi effects got better around the second film, but say this movie was where the series was getting dark well I kind of disagree there, this film just like the first two films before it was light hearted and fun while having its dark moments here and there, as the series did not start to get really dark until the next film after overall a fantastic movie with plenty of fun and emotional moments and also being the last film to be compused by John Williams fantastic 9/10."
288,9,After 6th rewatch it's fantastic,"The series is getting better which each movie ... this one was superior to the previous 2 and the new cast members were great. The principal cast are now so comfortable with their roles, that they may never be able to work again and it is fun watching them age on screen. Definitely darker and really may not be suitable for young children. This will make more money at the box office than the previous two and I have not seen a line (mob) for a preview that even came close to this. Michael Gambon slides into the Dumbledore role with ease and Oldman is his usual awesome self. Coltrane and Smith are as dependable as usual and Thelwis and Rickman are solid."
289,9,Saw it,"I thought this was the best of the series so far, until it got to the ""back in time"" sequence, when Harry and Hermione try to save the day. Now, let's see: I hate it when a film leaves interesting questions unanswered, or worse, forgets about them on the way. 1. How did Sirius escape from Azkaban and tricked the dormentors? (I hope that's what they're called :) 2. Indeed, Harry has a point towards the end of the movie: nothing is changed with Sirius's escape. Everybody would think he's a murderer who managed to flee. The truth that the 3 little wizards and us know about Sirius is still unknown to the rest of the world (fictional one, that is). 3. And now, here comes the best one, which i think has to do with the way the screenwriters and the director understand the notion of TIME. Or it's sheer stupidity... Let's say that the action of the movie, the way we see it, is a perpetuous present. When Harry and Hermione mess with the time artifact, they go back in the past to modify the future. The problem is some actions we see in the present (the stones thrown in Hagrid's hut, Hermione calling the werewolf, Harry performing the superspell) are coming from the future (the moment when Harry goes back in time comes after those three moments mentioned above, therefore it is the future on the axis of time). What I mean is this: how could the characters hear the stones, the werewolf shout, or see the spell, if these actions never took place? They will take place in the future (of course, by going back in time) It's a little bit tricky and maybe i don't make it clear, but this is a huge plot hole. Maybe someone else tries to explain this better than I? Or at least is there somebody out here who agrees with me?"
290,5,what about the plot holes?,The sheer emotion and the fantastic visuals of this entry into the Harry Potter series alone is enough for me to consider The Prisoner of Azkaban as the best in the series. It has a stroke of genius in its immersion that cannot be matched by any other one of the films in the series.
291,8,Emotionally rich & visually stunning,"Did you notice that, when Hermione used Time-Turner at 1:48 you can hear clock ticking sound all the time, while they travelling in time. It's brilliant idea from sound designers."
292,7,Time-Turner,After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.
293,7,The magic darkens,"This movie is very engaging, I am normally not a fan of witchcraft and magic movies but harry potter is different specially this movie include Time Travel and in perfect way and story is unpredictable too."
294,10,Engaging,"Being an avid fan of all of the Harry Potter line of books I was positively salivating in the queue to see the latest installment of the movie. And quite honestly I was a bit disappointed. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry James Potter), Emma Watson(Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint(Ronald Weasley) all gave their wonderful performances but there were moments in the movie that I did not care for. My main problem was the extra footage that did not belong or add to the storyline i.e. The Frog Chorus, the shrunken head on the Knight Bus. These items were fluff and was not part of the original storyline. I believe that these two parts should have been omitted and their monies used to make Lupin a more realistic werewolf. I am sure that Alfonso Cuarón is a wonderful director but he did not capture the vision as did Chris Colombus had in the previous Potter movies."
295,4,"Disapparate Me, Please!","I have seen a lot of movies over the years with Julie Christie. My favorite is Heaven Can Wait. But, her role in this movie is the very antithesis of the lovely Julie, that it is appropriate on her birthday."
296,8,Happy Birthday Julie,"As the third installment in the Harry Potter series, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' takes a darker turn compared to the first two movies. With the introduction of Sirius Black, the convicted prisoner who has escaped from the wizarding prison of Azkaban, the film dives deeper into the mystery and intrigue that surrounds the wizarding world."
297,9,The Wizarding World gets even more magical in 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban',"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004): Dir: Alfonso Cuaron / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis: Creative third film in the Harry Potter series and every bit as creative and detailed. Its imprisonment has to do with letting go. In this case the prisoner of Azkaban is rumored to be responsible for the death of Harry's parents and he has escaped. Alfonso Cuaron takes over directing after Chris Columbus successfully translated the first two. Cuaron previously made such films as Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Daniel Radcliffe plays Potter who learns the secret of his parents' death but also faces other fears. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are marvelous as his teenage companions who assist him in his quest. Gary Oldman steals scenes as the escape prisoner who not only has a secret regarding Harry's family, but also a specific power of his own. David Thewlis is also a great addition as a new professor who has a secret of his own. Exquisite special effects include a monstrous tree, werewolves, a griffin, a creature that is half horse and half eagle, and a trip back in time that serves different perspectives. Solid entertainment may be too dark for young viewers. Some parents may wish to use discernment with regard to the light-hearted use of witchcraft but the film is magical and adventurous at any rate. Score: 8 / 10"
298,8,Potter of Azkaban.,"Like most human beings, 13-year-old Harry Potter is becoming plain interesting as he gets older.  The newest installment, `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' is a testimony to testosterone and tribulation as Harry, Hermione, and Ron meet the threat of mass murderer Sirus Black, who, upon escaping Azkaban Prison, seriously wants to find Harry.  Even the hundreds of Dementors sent to protect Hogwarts from Black are more trouble than they are worth."
299,,`There's magic in the web of it.',"A change of direction helps bolster the film's darker tone, lending a slightly 'odd' feel to the piece, and a time-travel element introduced later on provides a refreshingly unique third act, but 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban (2004)' feels perhaps the least connected to the overall franchise, with its plot having little lasting impact aside from introducing some interesting new characters and concepts. It is an entertaining movie with several exciting, and occasionally somewhat scary, sequences, but it does feel slightly underwhelming on the whole. Still, it's a great film. It's a unique, enjoyable experience that sits comfortably among its peers. It also serves as a perfect transition from the earlier and generally lighter films to the heavier ones later on, though the transition is much smoother than you might remember and even the first flick has moments of proper grittiness in it. This film is the first in the series to properly capture the wistful tone associated with the character, too. Wonderfully inventive stuff. 8/10"
300,8,A wonderfully inventive and entertaining entry that starts the series' slow transition into darker territory.,"I really liked this one - very mysterious criminal Sirius Black , who was once Voldemort's trusted aide, has escaped from Azkaban Prison and rumor has it he wants to kill Harry Potter. Who is Sirius and why does he want to kill Potter? I won't give it away - you'll just have to watch and find out for yourself."
301,10,Another Cute Film,"Darker in tone than the first two films, with the nightmarish dementors circling Hogwarts and threatening to suck the soul out of both Harry Potter and Sirius Black, the wizard who's broken out of prison with the apparent intent to kill him. Aside from the menacing Snape and annoying Malfoy (who happily we get to see clawed by the hippogriff and punched in the face by Hermione), there is also a werewolf about, the look of which in that dark forest was pretty scary. Even the quidditch match is played in a howling storm. Is all of this darkness a metaphor for the turbulence of adolescence, with the three heroes beginning to mature and face the real horrors of life, both present and past? Maybe. There are also some really sweet little moments, like when the friends console each other gently when one is crying, or when Harry is told that ""the ones that love us never really leave us."" It drags on a bit in its 142 minutes and I'm not sure it's quite head and shoulders above all other installments in the series, but this is certainly a good one, and a nice prelude to the struggles to come."
302,8,Entertaining,"The first two Harry Potter movies were faithful, efficient adaptations of their respective books. I enjoyed them, although since I had read the books and they just retold the story of those books I felt they would have been more fun for someone who did not already know the story."
303,8,The difference between a workmanlike adaptation and cinema art,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, this is the third film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about Harry Potter In his third year at Hogwarts, where he discovers the convicted mass murderer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Black is known as Lord Voldemort's most devoted follower, and he's after Harry to avenge Voldemort. But, Harry soon discovers that there is a bigger culprit behind the conviction and that there is a strong connection between Harry and Sirius."
304,8,Another magical sequel.,"It's a shame some aspect of the movie is missing this time around, at least a lot compared to the previous two movies. Although this movie is missing some scenes I wanted to see from the novel, but I liked the fast pacing of this movie at the same time. But being more faithful to the novel while being fast paced would have been nice. Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the fact that the original actor that played Albus Dumbledore is replaced because of the unfortunate passing away of Richard Harris. The new Dumbledore lacks a lot of aspects that Richard Harris showed while playing the head Wizard of Hogwarts. The new guy simply didn't have the soft and yet someone you should never cross thing going for him, nor did he have that certain look in his eyes that showed wisdom. Yes, for some movies that is based on a book that doesn't go EXACTLY like the book doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But like I said those scenes would have made this movie much better in my opinion. Even if I didn't read the 3rd book in this franchise and saw this movie after watching the previous two movies. I would have thought something was missing in this movie regardless. I personally thought it could fit a lot of the parts in the book in this movie since this movie isn't close to the 3 hour mark. On a positive note though besides the fast pacing, is how this movie somewhat atones for the stuff that is missing from the book and makes it a bit more lively and actually has a bit of satire. Everything seemed slightly more sharp including the humor. Also addition of Gary Oldman is always a plus."
305,6,"Isn't really faithful to the book compared to the previous movies, but it's fast paced and keeps your attention for the most part","This is one of the few movies I have watched where I rapidly lost interest and nearly fell asleep (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the other). The movie was stuffed with details which I assume were faithful interpretations of the book (which I haven't read) but I felt the characters lacked depth and after 45 minutes I didn't really care what happened to them. Special effects were good and I think that the direction was better than the first two movies but overall it just didn't work. I have seen both the previous movies and found them more entertaining - so I am not an anti-Potter person. It was a relief when the credits finally arrived and I could head for the exit..."
306,4,Tedious for non-Potter fans,"I haven't read any of the books (I have much better things to do with my time), but perhaps that makes me more qualified to judge the movies on their own merit. HP 3 is a visually terrific movie, entertaining although not exactly gripping, with predictably good special-effects, and a top adult cast (Gambon, Rickman, Oldman, and Thewlis)."
307,,"Quite watchable, but Rowling's (flawedly conceived) world fails to impress me.","I confess that I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, and I am afraid I will not have the time to do it during the current reincarnation of my soul. This being said, I am judging the film by what I saw on the screen, and I cannot refer to the many details the book afficionados seem to be that familiar with. My opinion is that this film belongs to the category of kids film, and should not be over-estimated or over-judged beyond. It is actually quite good in its own terms, and doing good kids movies should not be under-estimated in a world poluated with that many bad taste or plain boring movies targeting young audiences, unfortunately many claiming Disney descendence, or even bearing Disney labels. My young teen-age soon enjoyed the film, and so did my wife and myself. "
308,8,just a kids movie - a good one though,"Harry and his wand-waving friends return in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the third in the series of high-flying adventures by British author J.K. Rowling."
309,7,enjoyable entry in the series,"this movie just sucked. the only decent harry potter films were 1 and 2. this one was unbelievable. what really annoyed me was the fact that dialogue was taken directly from the book, which is fine, but the character's say those lines (as a matter of fact ALL their lines) in a very boring and un-enthusiastic way, which brings me to my next point. this film was so depressing. just looking at it made me want to cut myself. not just because of the boring acting, but because of the color. THERE WAS SO MUCH GRAY! everything had a dark gray tint. the darkness level was so high, that the Ghostbusters game on Nintendo looks like a Van Gogh painting compared to this. the CGI is that bad, but could've been better. the only film that can use CGI and still be an awesome movie was 300. this film, had mediocre CGI. the only things that were even close to decent was the music and the special effects. that was probably their goal, to have all this CGI and great music to draw the audience away from such an awful film. WELL IT DIDN'T WORK ON ME WARNER BROS.! this film lacked what the two others had. originality. the two other films made up their own lines, amazing music, and they used CGI only when it was necessary. not this film. if you like this movie, fine, but i consider it an awful adaptation of such a great book in the series."
310,1,holy freakin god,"It's absolutely amazing to find out what all can happen when you put a promising story that's full of imaginations, wonders & endless possibilities into the hands of a master storyteller and watch him/her elevate it to a whole new level. Breaking from the monotony of the previous 2 chapters, Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first time we get a genuine taste of how magical, enchanting & mystifying the world of Harry Potter really is and the film as a whole is, in my opinion, the best installment of the Harry Potter franchise."
311,,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Harry Potter is a phenomenon. The books and the films, although I haven't yet read the books. I am convinced that one of the reasons behind the success of these films is that they are the only enormous epic adventures made for kids that don't make them feel like kids. Sure Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks CRANK out the huge films but they are cartoons and made with kids in mind. The Harry Potter series (especially the last two installments) including Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban gives children and adults who love fantasy a very serious epic with no holds barred, it doesn't feel toned down or edited for content but rather very real and intense and scary at times, exciting, masterful, and brilliant. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón takes the helm from director Chris Columbus and gives the series a serious boost in maturity which it definitely needed. Harry is older, his friends are older, the story is darker and his fans watching it have aged too quite likely. Cuarón gives it exactly the dark edge it needs. There is no doubt he is a far more mature director and perhaps even too dark himself to take on a children's movie such as this but he does it and flawlessly."
312,10,A feat of movie making that continues an outstanding series of films,"I have been looking forward to this movie for a very long time. i am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. when i went and sat down in the movie theater i was expecting a movie true to the book and story line. what i got got was nothing of the sort. I understand that things need to be cut in order for the length but critical things in the story were disregarded and never even mentioned. such as the origins of the mauredars map, why harry's patronomus is a stag, Cho, Cedric, and many more things that i don't have room to mention. I was very disappointed in the overall tone of the movie as well. The setting was completely different, Hogwarts looked gloomy and creepy. Lupin came of as kind of sleazy, (and i don't recall werewolves looking like skinny little chiuauas!). i hated every second of it and i hope that they choose a different director for the next movie. this movie put one of the best books in the series to shame! (What was with the chorus and the singing frogs in the beginning?!) Doesn't the director understand that wizards and witches don't wear muggle clothes?! they wear cloaks! everything about the movie was wrong. the three main actors did well for what poorly written script they had to deal with but snape and mcgonogal werent in it enough and the new dumbledore was a poor choice. i walked out of the theater thoroughly upset and disappointed! if you are a harry potter fan, save your time and money. i wish i had."
313,3,HORRIBLE!!! (contains spoilers!),"Both in terms of the actual story but also in the way the film is crafted, there's a major difference between the two first movies, and this one! And it's great! It seems more dark and gloomy, better framed, the CGI is obviously better and its great to work with more screentime for some of the superior, english actors. Emma Thompson as Trelawny, David Thewlis as Lupin etc."
314,8,Major difference!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is without a doubt one of the best fantasy films ever made. Yes, it is a Harry Potter film, but the first two look like TV films compared to this. The special effects are amazing, much better, the cinematography is beautiful, the direction much more confident and focused. Alfonso Cuaron was the best thing that ever happened to this series, and I miss him. Technically, it is one of the best achievements of the decade. The acting, for the most part, is brilliant. Wonderful performances from the adult cast, and most of the child actors. Daniel Radcliffe is weak at times, but he gets better as the series goes along. The writing is superb as well. Nothing but praise for this film, and I think it is a shame that some people think of Harry Potter as some fanboy film series, where it really is something magical (well, besides the first two). I really need to rewatch Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix to see where they stand, but one thing is certain. Alfonso Cuaron's direction was the best this series ever had, and this film is the most beautiful and visually stunning of the Potter films."
315,,Powerful and exhilarating! One of the best fantasy films ever made,"'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban' is a nice follow-up to the previous movie. The special effects are dazzling to look at. Cuaron wonderfully creates a sense of magic and adventure. The magical world of the school is spectacular to look at. The movie moves at a sluggish pace in the beginning but eventually picks up. Cuaron reunites and newly casts a terrific ensemble where Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and co reprise their roles, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis bring freshness and there are the hilarious cameos by Emma Thompson and Dawn French. Of the three protagonists, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are getting worse with their acting (even though I quite liked Hermione in this one). Rupert Grint remains more consistent with his character and he steals the show once again. Overall, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban' is still a nice family entertainer and it's quite sad how the next movie turned out to be so boring."
316,,One of the better Potter films,For a movie for 10-15 year olds and technology improvements this movie pulls off the entertainment value and like it's predecessors is relatively consistent with the books.
317,6,Entertaining while introducing stupidity,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter who is in his third year at Hogwarts and he is hunted by a dangerous prisoner who has escaped from the Wizards Prison."
318,7,The hunt of Harry...,"The best Harry Potter film, mostly thanks to Alfonso Cuarón and his crew."
319,8,The best Harry Potter film,Let's keep this short and sweet.
320,3,What Happened to this movie!!!!!!,"This film is the adaptation of the third book in the Harry Potter's saga written by J.K. Rowling, and is the first in the franchise that isn't directed by Chris Columbus, who makes way for Alfonso Cuarón. The cast, however, remains the same, which allows to this film doesn't seems a totally different thing from the first two, although there are changes in the way the story is told and seen. One of the most obvious changes is the gradual abandonment of the use of black school robes, almost ubiquitous in the first two movies. For some fans, its a transition to another stage of the film franchise. Also notable is the arrival of Michael Gambon to the role of Albus Dumbledore, left vacant by the death of Richard Harris. Although loyalty and attachment to the original book and it's details is a feature that will come to gradually disappearing, this movie still follows closely the history of the book. For all these reasons, this movie entertains, delights but haven't nothing surprising."
321,5,Interesting but not surprising.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a great third installment for the franchise, while a third film is normally when they start to fall flat, this loses no creative energy and clearly has much more story left to tell, and we are in no way sick of these characters yet either. Though I mostly find it to be a delightful entry in to the series, I did feel that it was a bit too dark, there wasn't really any gradual increase in the tone of storytelling that is light and simple in the Chamber of Secrets, to being much more sinister and severe here, I just felt the transition could have been more natural. The cast continues to delight as they deliver more dramatic and intense performances than the previous two movies, regulars such as Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are all outstanding, and newcomers Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon, who is terrific in his first portrayal of Dumbledore after the death of the great Richard Harris, they all add that extra depth that make these movies so much fun. A darker story that will have you at the edge of your seat, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to anyone looking for a good adventure or family film. "
322,8,"Franchise Jumps in to Darker, more Thrilling, Territories,","Well, if you have read the book, then I am begging you please don't watch this movie, you may hate it just like me. Few differences here.<br /><br />BOOK : The firebolt is received in mid days of the school, which goes for testing thinking it may contain some dark magic stuffs and till the end they don't have any idea who sent.<br /><br />MOVIE : He receives it in the last, and they get to know who sent it!<br /><br />BOOK : The story behind Sirius being animagus is revealed.<br /><br />MOVIE : Not revealed!"
323,5,Book readers won't like it.,"Each movie in the Harry Potter series (and of course the books they are based upon) is about the experience of Harry Potter and his two closest friends as they attend Hogwarts. His experience is based upon a wonderfully detailed back-story and interaction with dozens of students, staff, and faculty at the school. I think that Alfonso Cuarón missed the whole idea of the experience at Hogwarts when filming this movie. In the end with the way the movie is cut and the story presented the movie is just a bad horror film for teenagers; a number of people compared this movie to the Goonies, which is a lot better movie. I have read that there was a stated goal to produce a two hour long movie rather than three hour long movies of the first two. I have never understood the idea of shortening a good movie, as a fan I would have seen a better movie no matter what its length three or four times in a theater, rather than just once; there are a number of missing scenes in the movie that would go along way to improving this movie. While there is of course an argument on whether you would almost have to start over to improve this incredible awful movie. Alfonso Cuarón (and others involved in production) was in my opinion in love with the stupid special effects during the movie that did not advance the story line; especially with so much of the back-story missing. The transition between the seasons was interesting, but they took too long, and after watching the deleted scenes they could have been longer. The moving pictures in the frames became a distraction, was the giraffe really necessary? The Knight's Bus scene was way to long for the length of this movie, and the talking head was annoying, and the idea that Harry Potter could lie was entirely skipped. I was upset they changed Harry time at the Leaky cauldron, skipped the scene with McGonagell and Hermione, and I could go on and on. Almost all of the foreshadowing in the book was cut from the movie; however J.K. Rowling indicates that two scenes foreshadow later movies. All in all a dismal movie another movie like this could greatly affect the status of the franchise."
324,2,"My two word summary - ""It's Awful""","This film has a darker style than the previous Harry Potter films which really fits the tone of the story. As usual, we have the same great acting, design and effects that bring the world of magic to life. The story is also quite compelling and can get quite grim which makes it all the more engaging!"
325,8,Darker style,"The movie is still very good and start with a strong moment: harry used magic outside Hogwarts. And the new movie begin with this. The movie is pretty mysterious, have some interesting revelation that keep the interest until the end, we know more of Harry. The Danger here is Sirius Black in this movie it seem to be. I enjoyed also Lupin; he helped a lot harry but he s not what he seem. And the other interest here is the monsters who take all happiness from you. The end is not similar than the previous movies it dont really concern Voldemort. Its more arround Sirius Black. Still very interesting and enjoyable."
326,8,Want to visit Azkaban,"I am a huge HP fan, and I admit I am not his target audience. However, I just have to agree with the previous review about the lacking in this film. I understand that you have to make certain transitions or adjustments between a book and a film. However, there were MANY things about this movie that could have been much better."
327,3,Too Gloomy and Several Critical Aspects were missing,"With Chris Columbus abdicating at the sight of dark material, the Harry Potter was gratefully gobbled up by Alfonso Cuaron, a director having only at that point turned heads with the incredibly sexy Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). This is a vastly different Potter to that which came before. When his dead parents are insulted by an obnoxious aunt (Pam Ferris), Harry blows her out of the window, kicking his bedroom cupboard in a rage. There's no plinky-plonky music or pie-in-the-face sight gags, and when Harry steps outside of his house, the streets are grey and grim, not a cosy suburban horror show."
328,7,The franchise can finally be taken seriously,"It is clear that the new director has not just shaken up the style of the films, adding a touch more darkness and still keeping it funny whilst in a realistic fashion, but he has also had an effect on the younger performers. Either that or they've all been to acting classes between years 2 & 3, because their acting is noticeably better and helps to make the film less cringey and soppy than the last two."
329,8,It's A Kind Of Magic!,"With two Harry Potter films firmly under the belt and many other books, the phenomenon that is Harry Potter is easy to recognise and will stick with generations to come, but how does this film match up against two other reasonably successful films? Surely the curse of the sequel has to strike sooner or later. Not necessarily."
330,7,A healthy blend of fantasy and suspense in an easily manipulative world.,"Well, as soon as we left the Yate's movies, the Potter movies are rather good. Newell brought a touch of humor and levity while Cuaron has a really naturalistic feeling. If I had understood, it's the one who had been shot the most outside in the Scottish country and it's clear: the cinematography are extraordinary, much, much better than the dark Yate's movies. Next, if the movie is as calm and dull as the book (it's about an invisible threat without attacks contrary to the previous one), Cuaron took the opportunity to put Hogwarts and its grounds on the stage. We have never seen the school like this and the passing of seasons was depicted with poetry. In fact, as the only story Voldemort- less, the characters make a step behind and in this void, Cuaron was a best choice to shoot this stillness. For me, it was almost a lynchian movie because it was deeply rooted in nature and grabbed a lot of abstract or symbolic shots. I didn't count them but the ring, the circle is a motive repeated a lot here. Next, Williams succeeds an amazing task to double the great themes of Potter's score: after the Hedwig's one, the new one with the flute is excellent. At last, to explain my title, the climax of the story is as exciting than one its predecessor: with movies traveling into time, it's always great to see the characters watching themselves. On the extras disc, you got the best interviews session of the cast with a very supportive host. Thus, if all the ingredients were there for this great potion, the mystery is why they throw it away? "
331,7,Harry and the prisoner of azkaback to the future (dvd),"Producer Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films made of the Harry Potter series of fantasy books by J.K. Rowling, couldn't have made a better choice than stepping away from the camera and giving the reigns to a seasoned director with a fresh perspective. It's what makes ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" go from merely good to great."
332,9,"""Potter"" is sharper, smarter with new director Cuaron","I love the harry potter movies, and this movie is definitely the prettiest out of all of them. it's also entertaining and the storyline is one of the best storylines out of the entire series. i've seen it at least 20 times (no exaggeration). the only reason i gave it a 9 out of 10 is because it left out a ton of information from the book, but i guess that's understandable because they wouldn't want to make the movie too long."
333,10,beautiful movie,"(spoilers) Okay, I won't make any more jokes about the director, but you really can't help making a crack or two about a director who just made an acclaimed nearly porn film and the turned to a wildly popular adventure series starring a lot of budding teenagers. As it turns out, of course, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, personally chose Alfonso Cuarón to direct the third installment in the Harry Potter films, so that should really end any controversy about how closely the movie follows the book. I read the third book not long after the second film was released, so it has faded a bit in my mind, but it's pretty obvious that the majority of the storyline remains intact, and quite frankly I generally find it boring to hear lists of things that were in the book but not in the movie, or vice versa. I got enough of that while reading reviews of Troy."
334,9,Y tú mago también!,Well it was really good I really like how Daniel Radcliffe presented himself in this film in the face of danger and following his lines with his other cast members also that people that were in the previous Harry potter films were included in there role's from slithering house and other houses too and that dumble dorf and the other's in the film did a great job along with there wardrobe choices and that the guy from the first die hard film took on a role of a teacher because he had the haircut four it and he was honest in his role in Harry Potter films and that Daniel Radcliffe he was still growing up with his other cast members and that a lot of people forgot that besides the money as a actor he went on too make this film a historical event based on the director's guidance and that the movie Harry Potter series is bye far something else that isn't violent and there not a lot of CGI involved but from the hart's of people involved behind the cameras they used in this film and I will never forget what Daniel Radcliffe has done four my family with Harry Potter and the prisoner of askaban.
335,10,My Review four this film,"Like its two predecessors, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an out-of-this-world triumph in production design. But it's the first to depict not only the sensation of yearning propelling the characters at the heart of the world constructed by Stuart Craig, but a grasp of the way the supernatural lies beneath the ordinary, rather than merely frolicking whimsically at a frivolous remoteness from it. It's far less self-conscious about how to gratify an audience as immediately as possible and isn't as unquestioningly cooperative with the conventional modern family blockbuster mold. A new director with a diverse point of view can recoat and ventilate a series that could otherwise fall back on tired reiteration, which it previously seemed poised to do, and Alfonso Cuaron, a clever, unique and energetic filmmaker with a highly sensitive eye for quirky nuances, has done what few sequel custodians ever achieve or care to achieve, stimulating the characters and story arcs."
336,9,The Saga Grows with Its Character.,"This isn't one of my favorite Harry Potter movies, but it's still pretty good."
337,7,A great movie...,"I loved the first 2 Harry Potter movies. Then forgot all about them after watching. Now, everybody told me that the third is the best of the best. After watching it, it's official: they're all wrong!"
338,,Mercy is Sweet !,"Cuarón puts his indelible stamp on this intensely foreboding, visually spectacular third entry where omnipotent young wizard Harry is fed up with his obnoxious family members and out on his own. Returning to Hogwarts he's shocked to learn that Sirius Black--an infamous murderer who may have been involved in the death of his parents--has escaped Azkaban and is tracking him down to settle a score. The liveliest entry yet with an engrossing story, swift pace, rich cinematography, and some truly eye-opening effects that are exciting, and create a genuine sense of awe and wonder. A glorious treat from start to finish. ***½"
339,,a breathtaking and imaginative adventure,"It's the third installment of Harry Potter and already the child actors have done a lot of growing up. Visually and dramatically, they've grown into their roles, and director Alphonso Cuarón lets them flaunt that newfound independence in his only take on the series. The school feels more lived-in and tangible, as opposed to the amusement park it seemed in the first two movies, and its residents (particularly the three central Hogwarts kids) are less buttoned-up and disciplined, more comfortable with their surroundings. It's also darker and more foreboding, foreshadowing the idea that this series was headed into stormy waters."
340,6,Alphonso Cuaron Steers Potter and Friends Into Stormier Waters,"If you enjoyed the first two movies, be warned: There are plenty of differences in this third installment. With a new director on board (Alfonso Cuaron), the tone of the series has shifted somewhat, to a darker, more serious Harry Potter universe."
341,8,"Fun, dark ride","First things first: I took five kids to this. Aged from six to ten. I had been warned it might be too scary for the six year old. At the end they said ""so where are we going to eat?"". The six year old had barely jumped. This is Not Good. The rest of the audience looked the same. Distinctly underwhelmed. It works like this:"
342,2,"Perfunctory, crude, and gimmicky","For anyone who hasn't yet read the book, you'll do yourself no true service by seeing the movie. Harry's interaction with Dumbledore (the school's headmaster) is overwhelming absent. The parts of the story that are filled in by 3rd party dialog or interaction between Harry and other characters is woefully excised and any character development of Hermione dealing with time, her pet cat or her budding relationship with Ron is completely left out. Cuaron's version seems to be directed at hardcore Potter fans who might not mind the How's of the storyline and simply want the MAJOR plot points to fit between the books and the movie adaptation. Columbus' first two versions were true not only to the basic premise that there exists a miniature magician named Harry Potter and that he's cemented into some life and death struggle with the arch villain, Voldemort; those first two films were true to the nuances of the story. They followed the character development and told the backstory so that if you hadn't read the book (as several adults around me hadn't) you could still see the movie and not miss a beat in discussing Harry's life with your eight-year-old nephew or niece. With this installment you would be left to believe that Dementors are ghostly spirits who migrate with pack mentality and that Harry himself could lift off the whole lot of them from Azkaban just by mastering the Patronus curse (the book leans more towards a few Dementors circling him and some other people rather than 30 Dementors). I'm interested to see based on Cuaron's development (or lack thereof) of the Dementors how a future director will handle Dumbledore's assertion regarding who the Dementors will side with in the coming battle when Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge decides to try and hide that Voldemort has returned to human form in book 5 (Order of the Phoenix). Perhaps they are just Biblical demons and Voldemort is the devil incarnate. I like this story because it provides a whole new universe; a new context for fantasy and myths. Cuaron totally dropped the ball on explaining the Dementors and making them less demonic and more of a new type of creature like the books seem to imply they are."
343,3,Cuaron skipped the backstory and apparently assumed everyone has read the book,"The film centers on the escape of the sinister Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from Azkaban Prison; Sirius was convicted in Voldemort's plot to murder Harry's parents, and now it's suspected he must finish the job by killing Harry. As Harry returns for his third year at Hogwarts, grim wraiths named Dementors are stationed at every entrance to the school to ward off Sirius, but the Dementors are hardly reassuring, with their trick of sucking away the soul essence of their victims. Harry, too, has developed an edge. We first met him as the poor adopted relative of a suburban family that mistreated him mercilessly; this time, Harry is no longer the long-suffering victim but zaps an unpleasant dinner guest with a magical revenge that would be truly cruel if it were not, well, truly funny. Harry is no longer someone you can mess with. I like what Cuaron does with the look of the picture, but found the plotting a little murky; just when we should be focusing on exactly who Sirius Black is and why he killed Harry's parents, there is the sudden appearance of a more interesting if less important character, Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), a real rat who undergoes a change of purpose. Here I savored David Thewlis as a teacher too clever by half, Emma Thompson as the embodiment of daffy enthusiasm, Alan Rickman as the meticulously snippy Snape, Robbie Coltrane as the increasingly lovable Hagrid, and Michael Gambon, stepping into the robes and beard of the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore. But the world of Harry Potter remains delightful, amusing and sophisticated; the challenge in the films ahead will be to protect its fragile innocence and not descend into the world of conventional teen thrillers."
344,10,The movie Captures the book's Magic,"..To all the people who thinks this was ""disappointing"" HP : Try to watch the movies when you grow up , you will realize that this one is BY FAR superior to the previous ones, which i consider a total *beep*. My English is not very good as you can see, and the explanation why is better will get too difficult for me to find the words, and anyway no matter what i say, some people will continue thinking this is the worse harry potter , so , for the ones who doubt .. watch it, even if you are not regular to the movies or books. Cuaron made a remarkable job and is very different in many aspects to the other movies. Its even watchable by itself, without the previous ones, and you will find a decent movie with fantastic elements and deep atmosphere, dark , with beauty and enjoyable. By the way , in this one there is a REAL and good taste example of how to mix fantasy with something ""else"" , I'm referring to the magic lessons. In previous movies the magic lessons are just empty fireworks to attract kids with a stupid concept about ""what should be a movie with magic and fantasy""."
345,8,Just want to say ..,"Harry Potter was a huge part of my teenage years, reading the books and watching the movies. I even successfully got my mother into it was well. The magic of Harry Potter can be appreciated by anyone young and old alike. I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire fame, but this one surpassed both and even to this day I come back to this one more than even the sequels as well, courtesy of Alfonso Cuaron's masterful direction. He knows how to add what's both light and dark, young and mature into a perfect mixture. Michael Gambon is great as Dumbledore, replacing the late Richard Harris, David Thewlis has that conviction as Professor Lupin, and Gary Oldman has that edge as Sirius Black. There are many great moments in this movie, almost too many to name! From Aunt Marge getting her (hilarious!) comeuppance, Harry's first flight on a fantastic creature that he and his friends later have to save and then it saves them, to Harry learning an important, though difficult spell that he will have to use against frightening, hooded, soul-sucking creatures, to many playfully mischievious moments inside a cloak of invisibility, trying animal candies and more. Indeed, of all the Harry Potter movies, this one's the most magical of the bunch."
346,10,Third time's the (magical) charm!,"I liked the first two potter movies.  They had poor acting from the kids, and mediocre plots, but they were visually entertaining and there was a silly adventure that you could follow and be entertained by.  This movie was terrible.  The child actors are better now, however, considering the depths of badness they started from their new levels are nowhere near ""good"".  The movie was visually interesting with the fades, but otherwise had lost it's ""magical"" appearance that was so appealing in the other movies.  I can honestly say that there wasn't a single moment in this film that I wasn't bored or wondering when it will all end.  Finally, the plot can be summarized in one word:  pointless.  What is really bad is that movie franchizes like this will make money no matter what.  We're all going to go see it regardless and it will send all the wrong messages to the producers and studio.  If you are a purist and have more self-control than I did, don't go see this movie, make a statement!  :)"
347,4,This movie was awful,"The Harry Potter series begins to enter it's adolescence and leave behind the childishness of the first two films, resulting in one of the best films in the franchise. Oldman as Sirius Black is a delight, especially given he was always my favorite character, the addition of the Dementors add severity to the world as suddenly there is an institutionalized kill squad roaming about of devious creatures that are near unstoppable leading to one of the great moments of the series when they are inevitably overcome in grand fashion."
348,7,HP3,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is stronger than its predecessors. Ironically it starts off slow, the very beginning is trivial and a nod to the younger and earlier films before it gets darker and more eventful. Harry and his friends evolve from children into young adults and as they mature so does the story and filming. Curan does a decent job in pulling this film together. We see a very eventful film unfold in the second half. Sirius Black is not whom he seems to be after all and we see some interesting twists and events. The film really takes things up a notch in its final moments. Some themes are well illustrated, we see isolation in certain scenes with Harry. The first two films made it clear that Harry was special and is already well known in the Wizard world. The Prisoner of Azkaban builds on this theme nicely. Harry does have the support of his friends but we are increasingly seeing him take on more responsibility and live up to his magical destiny."
349,7,Taking things up an notch,"This is by far the best book in the series, and I really think that Cauron was a very bad choice to direct it. He ruined it. He said he wanted to make the movie dark and sinister, just like the book. But I can't help but notice that the later half of the movie is so 'dark' it is hard to even see it. I guess what Cauron failed to understand was that to make the movie dark like the book did not require him to veil the camera lens. He failed to understand that the book was dark because of the story and situations itself. Compare Cauron's movie with the earlier two ones directed by Chris Columbus, and it comes out looking even worse. Chris also took liberties with the plot and the look in the movies but it was a pleasure to watch them."
350,1,Cauron should have read the book.,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the most enjoyable and entertaining of the series so far."
351,10,A Delight for Fans of the Book,"I almost fell asleep during this nerd heaven. If Sirius and Lupin are innocent, is Pettigrew the main antagonist?"
352,2,NERD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The best of all in my opinion, the only ""bad"" bit which isn't that bad is the bizarre cringe ending but the film's allowed to have a bit of fun I think. This episode marks the first of the new era of Harry Potter films, no longer children they are teenagers now and acting and plot have improved."
353,10,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,You can watch the entire Harry Potter series and skip this pointless borefest entry and yet NOTHING would be lost.
354,1,BY FAR the worst film in the series!,"Alfonso Cuarón brought a different look and very pleased that the fans of the books, making The Prisoner of Azkaban, one of the most difficult and complex, one of the most lauded films of the franchise. The Mexican let go once the weather over the first two children and put Harry and the other students at Hogwarts during adolescence, leaving the plot darker, realistic, complex and dangerous. Everything is more compatible with the arrival of the main characters and the secondary stage of adolescence. Cuarón added more pace, humor and especially the adventure to the film, and the story flows without major interruptions. The direction leads to Harry Potter themes denser and deep, stirring with the past of the boy and bringing feelings such as anger, forgiveness and fear."
355,8,"The Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off for a more adult stage for the series, without abandoning the fantasy elements and new Hogwarts","Problems with books are that they inspire disappointing films.  For a change, magic is created from a book that defied adaptation.  The first two films based on the Harry Potter saga were mildly amusing, and we were glad we were given the opportunity to at least see what that magical world looked like.  They just didn't have the magic the prose of J.K. Rowlings had.  Now, Mr. Cuaron has created a darker and more beautiful interpretation of the third book, and this one contains every element the others lacked.  For once, our spirits soar and weep at the right moment.  Even the very short performances are given nuance and details to keep them in memory."
356,10,Superb,"It's Harry and his friends' third term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and the big news is that the sinister Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison. Black was incarcerated for his role in the death of Harry's parents and will be seeking revenge, so headmaster Dumbledore orders the school guarded by the fearsome Dementors and appoints a new teacher in the Black Arts, the mysterious Professor Lupin ..."
357,7,Third Harry Potter Movie Isn't The Best One But Still Terrific Entertainment,"For the third HP film, previous director Chris Columbus has stepped down to be simply co-producer and handed the directorial reigns to Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, until now best known for his comedy ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"". Otherwise the only change of personnel is Michael Gambon, replacing the deceased Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore, which he does exceptionally well. The main difference in this third instalment of the narrative is the tone: except for a humorous opening sequence, this movie is darker than the others and a little more complex in that characters are not always what they seem. Another (smaller but significant) difference is that, unless I'm imagining things, Hogwarts now has more black and Asian pupils."
358,,Mexican waves in part three,"Just rewatching this movie for the 3rd or 4th time. Definitely more than any of the others, and I don't exactly know why."
359,10,Rewatched it for the 3rd or 4th time,"The Knight Bus is really good and Hagrid's course is the best. Hippogriffs are amazing. Lupin is the new professor. Boggarts assume the shape of whatever you fear the most. They go to Hogsmeade village except for Harry because his uncle didn't sign the paper. There are dementors everywhere in Hogwarts because Sirius Black is on the loose. Harry fell off from his broom during a Quidditch game because of the dementors. Marauder's map helped Harry go to Hogsmeade and he found out that Black betrayed his parents and he swore to kill him so he asked Lupin to teach him how to conjure Patronus. Professor Trelawney is hilarious and her classroom at the top of a tower looks really mysterious. Grimm the black dog took Ron into the tunnel under that tree to Shrieking Shack. It turns out Ron's rat was Pettigrew the man who betrayed Harry's parents. And it turns out Lupin is a werewolf. So Lupin if the werewolf, Sirius is the black dog and the rat is Pettigrew. What makes this installment really impressive is Hermione and Harry going back in time to save Sirius who's captured and Buckbeak the Hippogriff who was going to be executed. They also saved themselves from the werewolf and Harry saved himself and Sirius from the dementors. He had thought it's his father who saved them but it was himself. At the end, Sirius got on Buckbeak and flew away. Pettigrew is on the loose and Dumbledore made all these things possible."
360,8,Harry Potter and Back to the Future,This third story with Harry Potter is easily better than the first film and is at least equal to the second and this third chapter seems to have a darker edge to it. Story begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going back for his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and re-teaming with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) but while at school he learns that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and that he is responsible for the death of his parents and now wants to kill him! Harry meets some of the new faculty like Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson) and Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) and while Sirius Black is still roaming the area the Dementors guard every exit but are they really going to protect them?
361,7,Excellent third installment,"Taking the fantasy for granted, it's doubtless that these movies of Harry Potter's saga are indeed and above all, well made. The visual part (special effects, landscapes and the magic of Hogwarts castle interior's) is fascinating. And the stories reveal a limitless and rich imagination that enslaves you. The story of this particular movie is full of spectacular moments, some adventurous and hazardous while others are dazzling and some others humorous but all of them making sense, taking of course the fantasy for granted as we said above. Their rhythm is almost hallucinating. The majority of these wizards (the young ones and the adults) are intrinsically human creatures and behave humanely, displaying humane feelings of love, hate, fear, distaste, friendship and solidarity. The actors and actresses who play their roles, do it in a very efficient and beautiful manner. In short, a movie that in the end leaves you in a good mood."
362,7,Fantastic,"Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to blow Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store."
363,8,Something Wicked This Way Comes!,"A very pretty movie indeed. Cuaron's biggest mistake was sometimes overemphasizing the wackiness. One of the most charming things about Rowling's writing is that she works so hard to immerse you in the world of magic, a lot of very odd things happen but they just sort of happen. Cuaron spends an inordinate amount of time on quirks (see talking heads among other things), time which could have been invested in better storytelling. Aesthetically aside from that complaint ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the most satisfying of the Potter films, as Cuaron does manage to pull off what he's clearly going for and wow the audience with great visuals. While this is a huge step up from the plainly weak Columbus films, Cuaron's sensibility doesn't really sync perfectly with Steve Kloves' screenplay which as per usual is alright but really saves very little room for character development and develops less of the mature confidence Rowling gained in writing ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", a clearly superior effort to the first two installments, instead it's really just more of the same. It seems like Kloves sat down, flipped through the book, picked out the 'most important bits', and converted them to screenplay format. It just whizzes through the story points and doesn't earn its Big Emotional Moments. Also difficult to know exactly how much of this rests on Kloves' shoulders and how much on Cuaron's, after all storytelling is the ultimate responsibility of the director, is it not? The film does grow stronger as it progresses, and the final 40-50 minutes is truly excellent, but the movie as a whole is more flawed than some will let on, although it's easy to see what impresses about it. The score is Williams at his cutesiest too, which is never good."
364,,"Visually dazzling, but lacking in some areas",But still 8 yet I don't know what is gonna happen next but I hope I give another part 8 or 9
365,8,Best harry,"Gone is Chris Columbus and so enters Alfonso Cuaron. Strike up the band, paint a banner, and the parade will be here in a few minutes."
366,8,"If you insult a hippogriff, it will kick you","Well clearly Richard Harris is to be totally missed. He came across as a more sincere Albus. Michael Gambon is good at one thing. Being a bad guy. I can't trust Albus now. Not totally. Now not that Michael isn't a good actor. He's very good when he plays less than goodie tushu characters. He's perfect in Open Range. And not that Richard Harris never played bad guys. But Richard was a far better actor. He was convincing at a bad or good guy. I just can't help but wonder if there could have been a better choice. I suppose Ian Mckellen was taken. But the similarities in Potter 3 to LOTR are matched in more than just actors. So he could have been a great albus. I can't believe how much their ghosts/guards... whatever look like LOTR's Ring Wraiths. No creativity here. Certainly the CGI has massively improved here, but so much so they may have forgotten the characters themselves. I'm not gonna go on a blistering attack on the movie. It's hardly a letdown. But I'm not gonna swoon over it like the first two films. I just hope they get their act together. Because Potter 3 is missing the fun. Wonder if Chris Columbus will ever come back. It was good to see Gary Oldman again. I don't see him in many films of the type he did in the 90's. And he's hardly recognizable in Hannibal. I hope they keep the original 3 friend cast together till the end though. Although I'd hate to be growing up like that. "
367,6,Missing it's magic. But not a total wash.,"HP3 was the last of my favorites. After this, the Harry Potter series kinda went downhill for. This one is darker and different than the previous two movies. An escaped convict named Sirius Black breaks out of Azkaban and tries to find Harry. Black is believed to be a supporter of Voldemort. During his 3rd year at Hogwarts, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin teaches him the Patronus charm to defend him against the Demeontors; the guards of Azkaban searching for Black. With the help of Ron, Hermione, and time-travel; Harry will come face-to-face with the man who betrayed his parents. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!!!"
368,7,Hogwarts: Year Three!!!,"Prisoner of Azkaban one of the best movies of the saga. Also it is an important part of a series also the fact that she is transitional, the plot changes from light and serene to dark and frightening. Yes it is the only part where there is no Dark Lord, but here history of parents of Harry reveals much more, and it on me is so much more interesting than the main plot. Excellent cast, and as always perfectly played Alan Rickman. The only thing that disappoints a little, so is the final. It has turned out some crumpled while in books logical and consecutive."
369,9,Prisoner of Azkaban one of the best movies of the saga,"I am amazed by so much new and positive stuff in this sequel. There are all the beings we hear in fairy tales, and other similar pc games and movies like Nancy Drew and Lord of the Rings like werewolf, dementor, effect of the full moon, magic map, and best of all - time travel. There is constant feeling of excitement, unpredictability, adventure, fun, and hope. So much small funny and realistic stuff, all which reminds me of childhood, jokes, pranks. But unlike in worse movies everything is looking so real and interesting, even the unreal stuff. This movie looks like deep dream, magic, and is enjoyable, probably better than all other sequels."
370,10,more adventurous and positive than two previous sequels,"THe first two Harry Potter films were good. But The third film, THe Prisoner of Azkaban, was the best. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in the three way tie for best Potter film. I liked The Half-Blood Prince and The Goblet of Fire just as much. The first two films weren't as good because in the first film, the three kids were annoying. In the second film, they grew up a little bit. But by the third film, they were all grown up. Daniel Radcliffe was fifteen, Rupert Grint was sixteen, and Emma Watson was fourteen. THey had matured also. They're acting improved also. They got rid of director Chris Columbus and the stupid one liners. They gave it to Alfonso Cuaron, a way better director. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a change to the series. Things got darker and more interesting. They're are tons of new people, including Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson. THe third film is more awesome than the first two also. Introducing things like the dementors, and Animagus's. THe prisoner of Azkaban is far from a disappointment. It actually ""Will broaden your mind into the future""! Emma Thompson's character says in the films. It will broaden your minds into the future of the series."
371,10,In the three way tie.,"I went to the library the other day, ready to pick up my DVD copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when I picked it up though, I swore to myself as I reserved the wrong Harry Potter movie, it was Azkhaban. I didn't really want to see it again. I wasn't sure why, I knew I liked the movie, perhaps it was because I had seen this not too long ago. But nevertheless, I started to watch it again. About half way through, it dawned on me why I wasn't too thrilled to see this again."
372,7,This movie gives me the creeps.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third in the franchise, and so far is the best , even if I liked Chris Columbus, the difference the direction of Alfonso Cuaron is huge , the cast is the same, the novelty is the excellent Gary Oldman as Sirius Black , and he is flawless , the direction of Cuarón is great , the film is more beautiful visually , I admit that scared me when I was a kid , the script is better, have fewer problems , the soundtrack is impeccable , the scene with the Gryphon is very good , the scenes are very good , has great moments, like the scene they each face their greatest fears , it's funny , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film has great moments , not to mention the great cast, the best of the franchise so far . Note 9.6"
373,9,"great movie , the evolution to the previous ones is huge .",LUMOS MAXIMA!! Let there be light.
374,7,Story lost me a bit,"I liked the first two Harry Potter films very much, they were as cheerful and entertaining as their literary templates, and exactly when the novels got darker, so did the films, but in order to make it completely possible, the director had to change. So instead of Chris Columbs, the director became Alfonso Cuaráron, because Chris Columbs is objectively simply unable to adapt Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. This HP film is therefore extremely dark, we have excellent time-back concepts and balancing these events that were subsequently done with what happened then. We also have Gary Oldman who embodied Sirius Black superbly. The film is mysterious and actually the colors of the film are much grayer and washed away than what we've seen before probably to match the tone of the film. Otherwise a great movie, significantly better than the first two as good as they are. But like the first two, worth watching."
375,9,Dark,"All those giddy memories of, 'The Chamber-pot of Dirty Little Secrets' are almost gone now; making room for the infusion of a new and improved escapade of one Harry Potter (or as my fellow movie-critic-wanna-be-snobs would say, H.P.) It has been a long two years since that very forgettable ending of 'Secrets' transpired. As mind-scrubbing as 'Chamber' might have been, we must not forget all the trials and tribulations of our telestic trio. I sense it is now time to return to that mystical land of glue-eating-tinkle-sprinkles and slobbering dog-birds. So come with me - one and all – and let's sneak a peek into that hap-hap-happy land of Her-Very-Very-Winey Granger and her two bestest and most emasculated buds of all timeRon ""The Weasel"" Weasley and Scary Harry Potter. Help me flip open that first movie-page, we will notice that those itsy-bitsy ankle biting-curtain-climbers have all eerily vanished, spookily replaced by older versions of each. Is this witchcraft? Is this some kind of mad wizardry? Whatever this may bedo not tell me this is this nature. Anyways – let's see how happy these pre-adults are – shall we. At first glance, nothing seems amiss. To the person, each student has a 'smiley face' spattered across his or her kisser, gleefully assailing one-another with irreversible spells. Oh the fun, the joy. Disgusting! This is way too happy (and boring)something better be wrong and soon. Thankfully the sickening gladness is squashed by the sudden announcement that the most notoriously spiteful, and evil, and terrible, and unsportsmanlike Sirius Jack Black has escaped from that horrifically, horrible place, we all know as Ask-a-bang-bang Prison. I don't know about the rest of youbut shivers are running up and down my spine. Uh oh, there they go again. This whole movie is a roller-coaster of activity with tailor-made spells and new, made-up words. We have 'The Demanders' who eat souls and make Scary Harry feint. We also find out that 'The Weasel's' hamster is actually a tubby evil, ugly, overweight, mean, scoundrel (who happens to be really bad). Such a snorting wobbler-type should be eviscerated and decapitated - all at the same time. Not really, I am just adding that for effect. Another aspect of the movie is the Walloping Willow Tree and it's spasmodically waving branches. 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Anyone else would have stayed away from this obviously dangerous shrub, but not H.P. No way. Like an idiot Potter flies head-on into the tree and - alas - gets smacked in the head and feints - once again. Do you want more? Not to worry, there is way more and very exciting. For me, this is a movie I can watch once and return in three or four months and watch again. Not only did I enjoy it, but I can enjoy it again and again. This is not Numba 1 in the series nor is it Numba 2 but it is a strong Numba 3. Very good movie."
376,8,Not Numba 1 or Numba 2 but Numba 3,And don't you dare tell me that if I wanted it to be like the book I should get an audio book - there are some things that shouldn't be changed!
377,1,This is what bugs me most (spoiler),My Take: The best of the novels come to the screen as the best of the blockbusters. 
378,10,"Darker, deeper and better. The best 'Potter' so far.","It's the third year, and Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. However, a new defense against the dark arts teacher has been hired, Professor Lupin, played by David Thewlis."
379,8,Begin to Suspect,"In his third year at Hogwarts Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is under the watchful eyes of the Dementors, soulless creatures on the hunt for murderer Sirius Black."
380,8,Likability still intact despite director fault,"I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says ""Oh you just HAVE to read this!"" that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress..."
381,7,Dark Days For Harry,"We now come to ""year #3"" of the ""Harry Potter"" films. After inflating his uncle's sister's with his anger and unconscious magical powers after she insults him and his parents. Harry runs away from the Dursleys, and is also afraid he might get expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside the school."
382,10,Another great Harry Potter installment,"While I wouldn't exactly be in a hurry to watch it again, the third instalment in the series was probably my favourite so far. It is still prone to atrocious acting from Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, as well as more unforgivably poor special effects, but the story is much less cluttered and contains plenty of exciting, well-executed sequences."
383,5,An improvement on the first two movies but still very underwhelming,"Praised by many, hated by many, the third part of this well known fantasy saga is probably the most controversial of all. Nevertheless, and trying to be the most objective about it, this is probably the best movie in the series, and one of the best movies of 2004."
384,8,Outstanding!,"I don't read books.  I have mentioned this in reviews before, but every time a Harry Potter movie comes out, I feel embarrassed that I am one of what seems only a handful of people that have never cracked open a J.K. Rowling experience."
385,7,Potter just keeps getting better,"Ridley Scott really hit on something for cinematic fantasy with 'Legend.' Just think, how many millions of dollars has Warner dumped into the 'Potter' and 'Rings' franchises only for them to blindly rip from Scott's masterpiece?"
386,10,Quixotic Fincher,I have seen all the TV reviews of Harry Potter and I was anxious to see the movie. Don't go. Save your money! It is the worst film of the three that have been released. The worst movie I have seen this year. It left so much of the book out. Some of the great scenes were left out. One scene ended and when the next scene started you were like...uh? It started off OK but went downhill from there. It contained none of the humor or interaction between the characters that makes the books so poplar. I was like so what..who cares what happens to these people in this film. It left me cold. The Prisoner of Azkaban was one of my favorite of all the Potter books and it was just ruined in the movie. I hope that the guy that wrote this screenplay and the guy that directed it will not be involved in the fourth movie.
387,1,I was so disappointed!!!,"As an adult HP fan, I was disappointed in POA. I believe the director did not read the books or watch the films or if he did, didn't understand them."
388,3,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"When they released Harry Potter's first movie I must confess I was a little bit reluctant; I mean, I thought it was gonna be such an stupid thing like all those Walt Disney 90's products (Mermaid, Alladdin, and so), those movies that are to be watched by stupid children. Anyway, I decided to watch it (I hadn't read none of the books neither), and it was quite a surprise. It reminded me of some great fantasy movies that I've always loved such as ""Labyrinth"", ""Neverending Story"", etc. I really liked it, and I liked the second part two. Mr. Columbus made an outstanding job to be enjoyed by children, adults, grandpa's Now this ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" came with some changes: first of all the director wasn't Chris Columbus anymore, and instead of him they recruited Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tu Mamá También""). I thought that he wouldn't be as good as Columbus, just because he has no experience on filming fantasy stuff, full of special effects and with a big big budget But then again I was wrong: Cuarón has demonstrated that he is as good in this genre than in any other else."
389,8,"I'm 27 and I love Potter... is it good, Doctor?",SPOILERS
390,,The series continues to improve,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the 4 films that are out (as of December 2005). The main kudos goes to the director, Alfonso Cuarón (the director of the acclaimed film Y Tu Mamá También). He brought out the adolescent natures of Harry Potter and his friends, starting with their loose clothing (as kids their age would do, whereas in the first 2, the clothes were kempt and proper) and flowing hairstyles (again the kids starting to show their independent natures as opposed to the first two films). The music is also the best of the 4 films, John Williams having outdone himself - this score is the best he has done in quite a long time, putting such varied styles into the film to make it a musical feast. But not only this, unlike the other 3 films which for me are merely adaptations of the beloved books, this one is an actual film which has a proper beginning, middle, and end and not just cut-and-pasted scenes as per book. Therefore, I give this film a well-done 9 out of 10! Highly recommended."
391,9,The best of the 4 so far,"I don't feel the need of writing about Harry Potter movies. I have read the books, I have been (in my mind) inside the magical world, I have witnessed the experiencesNow I'll try to write about the third part of J.K Rowling's fantasy. Why this and not any of the others? Probably because it is the best movie (not novel) of the first three and because I plan to write about the others eventually."
392,8,Well done Cuarón...,"This third outing for Harry Potter sees the franchise beginning to expand on its roots. The feel of this movie is different compared to Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, giving us a darker, more intense experience. Harry and his pals are growing up fast, our hero having to come to terms with the fact that the psychopathic betrayer of his parents to Lord Voldemort has broken out of the wizard's prison Azkaban (a sort of magical version of Broadmoor)and is possibly hunting him."
393,7,"Oooh, It's so dark!","'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sees Harry becoming an older and more rebellious character, this time wanting to escape the escape prisoner Sirius Black. In this story, Potter learns even more about his parents and about himself. This story and film is much more darker than the previous two, and although there is too much to fit into the film, the editing was done well to allow the most important parts crucial to the films success. I would recommend reading the book to get more of the depth of the story because some parts had to be cut out completely, and these are no-doubt relevant to what happens later on. Mainly, these were more character-focused scenes to build up the characters rather than action scenes."
394,7,the best so far,"This film is amazing, it has a really interesting and believable story, it has really endearing characters and the film is extremely well made, it also has the darkest and most interesting elements of the entire story and has much improved world building and pacing compared to the rest of the series."
395,8,The best film in the series,"Charming and Extraordinary<br /><br />As with previous Potter films, this one is wonderful. The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts."
396,10,Epic Sequel,"The first HARRY POTTER we saw on the big screen was pretty young, today he isn't just pretty young; he's a baby! Daniel Radcliffe is much more mature and looking better in every way in this third story of Harry Potter. The movie is much darker, much more thrilling and satisfying than any of the two before. The movie is truly fabulous I tell you, and with all the fantastic characters this movie is even far more interesting than the others!"
397,8,The latest and best,"I've been watching the Harry Potter movies despite being the one person in society who hasn't read the books, and I've been enjoying them. The series got a new director for ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" and that's immediately apparent not just from the name on the credits but from a noticeably different stylistic feel. As a consequence, the strengths and weaknesses of the third film are balanced a little differently from those of the first two. One of the most immediately arresting, memorable, and commendable things about ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the extraordinarily imaginative and well-realized visual style, far outpacing the already-impressive first two films. It's packed with stunningly-created sights such as the aunt who is blown up like a balloon, talking shrunken heads, crooked offices, and rather haunting moving mugshots on the newspapers. I even loved little touches such as the addition of a uniform number and realistic-looking sports equipment to the quiddich game. I don't know how much of this stuff was described is prose form by J. K. Rowling and how much was created for this film, but I'm hugely impressed: I feel as if I could pause the film at any shot and spend fifteen minutes examining the background."
398,7,Shouldn't be held prisoner,"A pretty impressive change in tone for the series, this third Harry Potter movie is a solid one. The story is captivating, the beasts impressive and the lore important. My favourite one to date."
399,9,A Solid Potter Movie,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is pretty impressive for a Harry Potter film. With Alfonso Cuaron at the helm, the film is much more adult and darker in tone. Breathtakingly shot and superbly visualized, there is genuine emotion in the story, unlike the 'americanized' tone of the first two films. Harry is older this time and ready to get angry. Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson provide stand out performances (though only supporting in nature). The young actors are generally competent though Radcliffe struggles a bit compared to Watson and Grint. The special effects are truly magical, specially some scary 'dementors' and an amazing 'hippogriff'. The film is still a bit too long and some parts of the plot aren't fully explained."
400,,dark and stylish Potter with a Mexican sensibility!,"This is not the Harry Potter that we've come to expect. This kid, and his friends Hermione and Ron, have become rebellious...like todays teens. Of course, they ARE teens now. But they've actually become disrespectful, yelling SHUT UP to adults and generally acting a bit too much like I see kids doing everywhere. It make it a bit more difficult to actually LIKE the kids the way we have in the past. The story is, as usual, very good, the acting first-rate and the special effects are better than the previous films. There is a little less ""wonder"" built in, with emphasis on the story and characters rather than the magical stuff at Hogwarts (floating candles and the like). The tone of this film is a good bit darker than the previous two also. However, I still enjoyed watching it and will, as always, eagerly await the next installment of the Harry Potter series. However, I only gave it a 7 out of 10 because of what I cited about the attitudes of the kids."
401,7,Hmmmmmm,This addition to the franchise is quite a bit better then the last two. The other two were pretty boring and childish and this one is somewhat more exciting. This is where the acting starts to get better to which is enjoyable.
402,6,Better then the first two,"I honestly thought that this film was going to be a failure, but I was proven wrong. It is better than the first two films! Not necessarily a triumph over the others though. The prisoner of Azkaban was always my least favorite of the series. To me, the book was too dark. the movie was dark though too. I say the first two films are based upon the magic of Hogwarts while the third is about the true, present darkness of the wizard world. I will not say anymore, so I won't be considered a spoiler! the film is also different for many reasons and the same. here's a list of differences and similarities."
403,8,Alfonzo has directed the best Harry Potter film ever!,"When I heard Alfonso Cuarón is at the helm of affairs for Harry Potter III, I was a bit skeptical owing to his reputation for Y Tu.... But after watching the movie, I must admit that he has done a fantastic job. Right from the start, the movie has an eerriiee feel and most portions of the movie are dark probably signifying the rise of Voldemort in days to come. The movie also seems to the horror for kids. Major portions of the movie are shot in dark and surprisingly the Quedditch game as well."
404,,Horror for kids!!!,This review contains spoilers.
405,8,Darker and more mature themes,"The third Harry Potter movie is a good movie. Compared to the first and second one it is different and I think that the first two movies were better. But with a new director is it normal that everything is different, and that doesn't mind a lot. There also a lot of things better, like the clothes. The Trio wears actually nice clothes and that is way better."
406,10,"Good movie, but too much is skipped","From the get-go, it's clear that the latest Harry Potter film was directed by someone else.  Unlike the first two, which do their damnedest to mimic Rawling's magical and slightly whimsical portrayal of the world she creates, Cuaron's interpretation focuses on a much darker element that is barely evident in the story.  Aside from a few forced jokes, there is very little whimsy in his take on the book, which is a travesty."
407,6,"Overly dramatic, the latest Potter flick fails because of direction","Harry Potters third adventure is darker and grimmer than the first two (probably mainly because of it's new director), but that doesn't necessarily make it better... or worse, for that matter."
408,6,"Yep, they're back again","This movie really captures the books magic, this is by far the most abstract, natural telling of an amazing book. The movie itself lives up to its counterpart really well, the story is iconic, the characters had actors that portrayed them marvelously, all in all this movie was great, the camera angles were intensely satisfying. I've always been a massive Harry Potter fan ever since being a kid but when I watched this again after so many years you pick up on so many different hidden gems and its great when you do see them."
409,8,Same Level Of Magic As The Book!,"I absolutely LOVE this film, but as a Harry Potter book fan I was slightly disappointed in how it had been adapted from the book."
410,9,"Brilliant film, but fairly badly adapted","Harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. It's the crews third year at Hogwarts. Everybody is on high alert when a prisoner Sirius Black(Gary Oldman) escapes from the magical mass security prison of Azkaban. Many believe he might be heading for the school and is looking for someone. The prisoner of Azkaban is often regard by many as one of the best installments in the series primary because of its theme and tone. It was really the first to push more of the darks side of the story. Who is Sirius Black? What is his connection to Voldemort and how does it connect to harry? Many parts of the films there's a lack of color in many shots sort of symbolize the bleak presence here at the school with the dementors these sort of soul sucking Wraith creature looking for black. These are the monsters that everybody associates with harry potter, and for good reason their creepy. You don't really know what they look like under these black robes apart from their corpses like hands. Their used by the ministry of magic to guard Azkaban and feared by most Wizards. That alone make them interesting. When you first see these thing on the train this tell you your getting a slightly different kind of film then the first two. The characters it's also shows harry as more emotional for the first time this point in his life harry not taking anymore lip from anybody he's more assertive in this. Ron and Hermione both the still give great support and the film while it's going for a more serious tone this time it doesn't forget to have fun scene like when the boys' are trying out snacks and their all making these sound effects. Little nods Ron and Hermione as they bicker about each other pets, holding hands for a split second. Hagrid teaching a class this year and you get the scene of harry riding on Buckbeak you still the magic in the air as the talon just graces the water. I have to say that Gary Oldman as Sirius doesn't disappoint with build to him. What they end up doing with his character is handled well. There's a moment where him and harry actually talk and it's one of the best moments in the series. He really added a lot of depth making him one of the most liked characters. Same with Lupin who I personally found as one the most impactful teacher to Harry. Most of the film he gives harry words of advice about conquering his fear and looking from the happy moments in his life. He's was also really close to Harrys parents so there's a lot of connection. It's not really much of a spoiler but it's eventually revealed that he's a werewolf. The movie's pretty on the nose about it, the second werewolves are brought up by Snape it's kinda obvious. With the constant symbolize and references of moons. Lastly I have to talk about is the time turner. Through out the movie Ron's poking fun of how Hermione is always everywhere out of nowhere. It's reveled that she has this device that she using to go back in time to attend her classes and it get used again. This thing is never brought up again in any of the movies. Obviously it been to broken as a plot devices, but you can't ignore that this things existed."
411,8,"""I solemnly swear that I am up to no good""","I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I loved the first two films.When I heard that they got a new director(Alfonso Cuaron) for the third installment I was worried,but I must say I worried over absolutely nothing."
412,10,The Best Potter Yet!!!,"So here we are with number three in the series of a now older 13 year-old Harry Potter that badly limps in story content.  Sure, the movie is full of neat special effects, cute scenarios, and spectacular sets; however, as far as a good tale is concerned, this screenwriter must have been absent during writing 101.  This fable keeps bouncing around from one implausible and twisted situation to another without rhyme nor reason to fortify its transitions.  If I wasn't enthralled by the effects presented on the giant IMAX screen at the Loew's IMAX, I probably would have spent considerably more time at the snack bar and the restroom."
413,5,A Garbled Tale  A Lot of Fluff,"Finally! A breath of fresh air comes to the Harry Potter series! After the two good, but not great, films directed by Chris Columbus, which were both pretty much the same, something new had to come to the series. Something that could take this series and spin it in a whole new direction. Something to make this children's series a bit less childish. That something is director Alfonso Cuaron."
414,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 8/10,Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) is about to start his third year at Hogwart's school of Witchcraft and Wizardy but trouble has started in the world of non-magic folks aka Muggles. It seems Harry has accident inflated his Aunt Marge (Pam Farris) and runs away to be united with his best friends in the whole wide galaxy known as Hermonine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grinn) as he goes back into the world of magic for his new school year. He gets a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher named Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) whom befriends the boy and of course there's talk about an escaped prisoner from Azkaban named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) that is rumored to be heir to Voldermort as he troubles poor Harry. Not only that but also some Death-esquire Dementors are searching around for him to have his soul but can Harry find out who the true heir of Voldermort is and is Sirius really the one behind it? 
415,10,A brilliant installment!,"These days Alfonso Cuaron has proved himself to be one of the finest film directors of his generation thanks to him making great films like ""Children of Men"" (2006) and ""Gravity' (2013) along with adding this movie to his resume of memorable films back in 2004. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third of 8 films in the entire Harry Potter franchise and it is a really good movie even though it isn't really as original as the first two movies in the series, even though Cuaron is very engaged with his storytelling here. Like the first two films the main characters along with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who still continues his adventures at Hogwarts with his two good friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint), but the threat against Harry is much more serious against him this time. The threat to Potter and his friends is realized after he returns to Hogwarts and is told by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) that a convicted murderer by the name of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from the prison of Azkaban who is supposedly out to kill Potter. After the other professors find out about this threat Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells all Hogwarts students that they have set creatures that look like the Grim Reaper called Dementors at every single entrance on the grounds of the Hogwarts campus. Black was convicted in Voldemort's plot to kill Harry Potter's parents but towards the end of the movie Black becomes a changed man, for reasons that I will not spoil. The visuals are still breathtaking as ever, and the supporting characters along with Black and Lupin, as well as the likes of Dumbledore, Snape (Alan Rickman), McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Trelawney (Emma Thompson) are expertly written. There are also other great components of this movie including the script by Steve Kloves who also wrote the screenplays for the first two films, as well as mind-blowing editing, excellent cinematography, brilliant performances, and the haunting score by the legendary John Williams are what make this movie work on a full scale. Though I have no problems with this movie, I do have a problem with Warner Bros. for not honoring the replacement request from Richard Harris who originally played Professor Dumbledore, of which Harris wanted his good friend Peter O'Toole to replace him after his death. Though Michael Gambon was excellent as Dumbledore I do happen to think that O'Toole could have done him one better. Despite that I still think that this is one of the finest films of 2004."
416,10,Just as magical as the first two,"""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best Harry Potter movie so far - and I'm not at all embarrassed to admit that I enjoyed the first two films as well. Critics of this series puzzle me; the books are good potboilers, and so are the movies, so what's to complain about?  The casting and production design in each film has been pretty much perfect.  Certainly, the Potter films are closer in ""look"" and tone to the books' vision than the mysteriously acclaimed Lord of the Rings movies, which drain much of the whimsy out of Middle Earth and turn the whole saga into an Orc-hewing action fest."
417,10,the best entry in a strong series,"Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard."
418,4,Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"At first the third HP-Movie wasn't one of my favorites, but after I became a little older, I began to love that movie. (When you watch it, please pay attention on the scene, when Hermine and Harry are hiding behind the tree, because the werewolf is searching them..and then they're beginning to walk BACKWARTS! That's SO ridiculous! I love that scene and have to laugh everytime I watch it)"
419,10,The best scene of all Harry Potter movies!,"OK the first thing i want to say is that if you have not read the book or seen this movie than do not read this review because it gives away many parts of the story that i don't think should be ruined for you, the second thing i want to say is that the prisoner of Azkaban was my second favorite book out of the series so far, right behind the order of the phenix"
420,8,NEED THE OLD DERECTOR BACK!!,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the third in the series of books and movies.  For the third installment, Alfonso Cuaron takes over for Chris Columbus as director.  And he truly shines as he takes the helm! ""Azkaban"" is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies!  The imagery is beautiful and amazing, such as Buckbeak the hippogriff's appearance.  There has been much creative license taken with the original book, we must admit. But a few of the changes could be called improvements, such as the development of the Marauder's Map.  Anyway, I'll be looking forward to what Mike Newell can do when he directs the fourth installment, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."""
421,9,Harry At His Most Magical!,"(Synopsis-Spoiler?) In `Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' the summer is finally over, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) can leave his Uncle Vernon's home and return to school.  Before he leaves, Harry has an encounter with Aunt Marge.  Harry uses his magic to inflate her into a large balloon, and she floats away.  Harry runs away and is picked up by the Knight Bus, a very special bus for wizards and witches.  Harry is dropped off at the Leaky Cauldron pub, where the Minister of Magic is waiting for him. The Minister has corrected the situation with Aunt Marge, and doesn't punish Harry for using magic in the non-magic world.  The Minister wants to protect Harry, from a dangerous wizard, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from Azkaban prison.  It is believed that Sirius Black played a part in the death of Harry's parents, and now he wants to kill Harry.  Harry meets his two friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), at the pub. They all go to the train station to return for their third year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  They meet Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) on the train.  The Dementors, the terrifying Azkaban guards who can paralyze their victims and suck their souls, stop the train, and search for Sirius Black.  The Dementors paralyze Harry, so Professor Lupin uses the Patronus Charm to shield Harry.  The Dementors are sent to Hogwarts to protect the school and capture Sirius Black.  Harry becomes a friend to Buckbeak, a magical half-horse and half-eagle creature that can fly.  Harry loves to fly with Buckbeak, but when Buckbeak hurts another student, he is ordered to be destroyed.  Harry must try to save Buckbeak.  Sirius Black has been spotted at the school, and Professor Lupin teaches Harry how to use the Patronus Charm to protect himself.  If you are a Harry Potter fan, you will love this movie.  The movie moves at a rapid pace, and it is over before you know it.  I can't wait for number 4.  (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 2:16, Rated PG) (10/10)"
422,,Enjoyable and moves at a rapid pace,I thought the pervious film was a bit tedious and this seemed to follow that.
423,7,If you like magic and cameos then this is the franchise for you,All Harry Potter Fans are sure to be delighted with this movie which was by far the best one yet. The first two movies were good but not that good. The change of director has brought only good things and also the Prisoner of Azkaban book was more exciting than the first two.
424,10,A delight for Harry Potter Fans!,"I have really been looking forward to this film for a long time since I thought the first two films were excellent and this was a MUCH better book/story. The previous films had worked very well even though they left quite large parts of the books out, there was a continuity and a flow that was true to the spirit of the books. Unfortunately this can not be said of this film, and for this I am grateful that the Director is not making the next film in the series."
425,6,"Great in places but a jerky, 2D adaption.","The third film in the Harry Potter film series, based on the book series, this time with a new director on board... with mixed results. While the first two films were visualy stunning I had found them to be a tad on the dull side with too much of the books adapted and too many somewhat dull scenes.. however this one seems to have gone the opposite route..  this film seems somewhat rushed, as though we are missing storylines.. things seemed to move too fast to have much of an impact and many of the characters, particularly the adult ones, seemed to filter in and out with little development.. Someone who missed the first two chapters and then checked in for this one would be completly lost. Not that this one is without its merits, the kid actors are developing into decent thespians and growing with their roles, and I did apreciate the slightly darker tone that this version took.. but the storyline just seemed to lurch along too much without satisfying resolutions.. they really need to kinda split the difference on the next installment. GRADE: C+"
426,5,A bit of a mishmash,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004, Dir. Alfonso Cuarón)"
427,8,Definitely Better than 1 & 2. Simply Amazing,"Just like the first 2 movies, I have seen this one on TV a few times, but not seen it in it's entirety until today. The tone of the movie is different from the first 2 movies which had a family movie tone to it. The story is intriguing right from the beginning and you notice straight away that it's different from the first 2 movies when you see that scene on the train which sets out the dark tone of the movie. What I like about these Harry Potter movies is that there's a few twists and you cannot predict what will happen next. Overall the movie is good, but I enjoyed it slightly less than the first 2 movie which is probably due to the dark tone."
428,7,Different from the first 2 movies,"A great mystery as always. Who is Silas Black, what is he real connection to Voldermort, did he commit the crimes he committed? These are the questions Harry, Hermione and Ron must solve in order to find the truth and save Harry from the killer and the Dementors who seems to have a sick obsession with him. They attacked Harry every change they got, what was that all about? The Dementors have got to be the scariest monsters in the HARRY POTTER universe and one I would never want to meet in the flesh. Now this is allot darker then the first two and really little kids around five or six might find it too scary. But kids 7 and older can handle this scariness of this one. The effects and characters are up to the others in the series. A welcome edition to the HARRY POTTER library and I think I'll give it....9 STARS."
429,9,A great mystery,"With the latest installment, the producers have taken an extra year to produce it and made the inspired decision to put their faith in Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. It was a brave decision however because although his last film Y Tu Mama Tambien was critically acclaimed, it was as far away from a kids fantasy film as you could get, in fact as some people described it, it was a Mexican porn movie. Now don't get me wronged I enjoyed the first two movies but despite all the money and special effects and sets, it did feel too conventional. Chris Columbus did a good job of introducing the Harry Potter universe but he did it simple. The film looked good but much like the Star Wars prequels it didn't get the blood pumping like a film with that scale has the potential too. The third installment really did work as a great movie going experience, I had sweaty palms by the half way stage and got really engrossed, what a great fantasy film should do."
430,9,Film of the year! Best Potter film by a country mile!!!,Directed by: Alfonso Cuaron
431,9,Not just a good Harry Potter movie; a fantastic movie in general,"The start of Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is threatened by the escape from Azkaban Prison of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Voldemort's murderous henchman who betrayed Harry's parents, getting them killed. Along with this pals Hermione and Ron Weasley, Harry must try to stay one step ahead of Black while dealing with the new school year and the horrifying Dementors, Azkaban's jail keepers that now surround the school."
432,7,Harry Potter is back for his best film yet,"It's okey its okey its okey its okey . it because it full of fantasy and magics,I like it"
433,6,It's really really really okey,"Unfortunately, fans did not appreciate this movie at the time. Alfonso Cuaron's vision of the potter World would be better if he had directed the entire saga.<br /><br />I really was disappointed with Columbus, then Cuaron arrived :) and then he left :( So disappointed. It was the fault of the potterheads."
434,9,The best of the series,"Plot: After blowing up his aunt Marge, Harry returns back to Hogwarts to find that mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. Soul sucking beings called dementors are placed all around the school. At first trying to stay away from Sirius as much as possible, Harry soon learns that it was Sirius that sold out his parents location and led to their deaths. "
435,9,"Great, but not my favorite as it is for most",This film is spine chillingly entertaining. Definitely a must watch if you love Harry Potter.
436,10,My fav Harry Potter film,"I really liked this Harry Potter.  Of course, I don't know how credible my review is considering I've read only the first book and haven't seen the second movie.  Nontheless, I found this movie very fascinating.  The story was very captivating and kept my eyes glued to the screen.  This was much darker than the first one (could be because of the new director).  There were a lot more special and visual effects.  I strongly disliked the new Dumbledore.  He seemed like a cold-hearted, sly, cunning person compared to the warm, cozy, grandfather-like one in the first one.  Even though I haven't read the book, I still felt in a few places that something was missing and didn't make complete sense.  For example, I get why Harry saw ""his dad,"" but I don't get why he saw the moose."
437,9,Excellent movie,"Finally, harry potter has a better movie than the book"
438,10,I love you alfonso,"Alfonso Cuarvos takes over from Chris Columbus for the third tale in the ""Harry Potter"" adventures. The plot has a more adult, ambiguous tone than it's predecessors, and Hogwart's feels less like a place of magical wonder and more like a creepy, haunted house that just happens to be a school."
439,9,New director and new tone,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of the Harry Potter books turned into a movie. With a new director, some mite say the film would be destined to fail but in my book, it's honored the book memorably. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is yet again returning to Hogwarts for his third year at the magical school. "
440,7,A Few Minor Changes Have No Affect. It's Still Good.,"After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series)."
441,7,A huge improvement over its prequel,"It's time for the third film of the series, and this one was particularly exciting with a stirring change in director."
442,7,The Journey Takes a Darker Turn!,"Disappointing movie. Wasn't faithful to the book, didn't stand on its own merits."
443,1,Very disappointing,"Dark...I noticed that from the previews in the theaters before the movie came out and on TV when they finally got around the showing the previews. It seems that as the ""kids"" grow up, their plights do as well. This Harry Potter series is not the ""kiddie"" movie that some have said the previous installments were. This movie is more adult with young cast members in almost adult roles."
444,8,Definitely NOT a kids movie...Possible Spoilers...,"Pros:<br /><br />1. The special effects, for the most part, still look incredible and they serve up many memorable moments e.g. an inflated Aunt Marge (Pam Ferris), the dementors floating up the Hogwarts Express, and the Knight Bus tearing through London.<br /><br />2. The cinematography is beautiful with the smooth camera-work that not only creates awe-inspiring shots, but it really helps to involve the viewer in each scene.<br /><br />3. The creature design is brilliant with each creature looking phenomenal from the werewolf, to Buckbeak, to the Dementors.<br /><br />4. The fantastic score is never solely relied upon or overbearing, and it always adds to the atmosphere appropriately.<br /><br />5. The sound design is mesmerising and it helps to create a magical and ethereal tone.<br /><br />6. There are great performances by David Thewlis (Professor Lupin), Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew), Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger).<br /><br />7. The action scenes are engrossing, especially the scenes involving the werewolf and the Dementors.<br /><br />8. There is tremendous chemistry between Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley)."
445,8,"The Best Harry Potter In My Opinion, With An Excellent Mixture Of Mature And Family-Friendly Themes","I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series, and have read all the books several times, up until the sixth, (July 16, 2005) and this movie was for the most part, trash. It left out highly important plot keys like who Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs are, how important it was that Harry's Patronus takes the shape of a Stag. The back story it lacks is highly important to the books, and if they talk about time constraint, then what about that scene where Harry rides Buckbeak the hippogriff for five minutes? The CGI is amazing but I think it would have been a lot better had they kept the back story in. The worst part of this movie is the Shrunken head, who is just down right annoying. He wasn't even in the books but added him for some reason, unknown to us all. So if you want to know what happens to Harry in his third year at Hogwarts, skip the movie, and go buy the book. It costs just as much and is much more worth it."
446,2,Not Nearly Up to Par,"I don't think that this is a film for little kids any more. It has gone beyond simple magic to some sophisticated logic comprehension. I think that this movie is the best among the three. It is no longer just about good versus evil. It actually has a twist, that made this whole movie so much more interesting and more enjoyable. "
447,9,"Time travel story, my favorite.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. New evil. It's a little unusual to perceive the almost new course of the Harry Potter movie about the boy who lived. After two almost childish fairy tales, the third film tries to seem more adult. This is a large amount of a dark filter and constant rain, thunder, despondency. There are also a huge number of smalls, seemingly funny scenes in the film (Hermione hits Harry on the arm, someone gets slapped on the head, someone is bitten by a book, and so on) and this, unfortunately, is very striking, and it seems that all this is superfluous. In general, the story itself is very interesting, thanks to the source."
448,9,New evil.,"Considering that this is the only entry in the series that doesn't revolve around Lord Voldemort (As much). ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", is the turning point. Introducing more talent, more characters and more thorough stories that will happen to effect Harry's life for the rest of the series."
449,8,Alfonso Cuaron Works That Potter Magic.,"It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts. But as soon as after he left the Dursleys and set off for a new year at school, catching up with Ron and Hermione again, things were not as smooth-sailing as it seemed to be."
450,8,Something wicked this way comes.,The Book was one of my favorites and it introduced me to one of my most favorite characters in the sci-fi genre I am talking about Sirius Black the titled prisoner of Azkaban. It is Harry Potter's third year and suddenly things are changing for Harry things that have never been told to him about how his parents died are surfacing and suddenly everyone is worried about Harry's safety a Madman named Sirius Black has done the impossible he's escaped from Azkaban something no one have ever done before. People are worried That Black is going to look for Harry and kill him. THEN things take a twist for the extraordinary as one sub plot meshes with another and another and you end up with the finest entry in the series thus far. Gary oldman is outstanding as Sirius Black a Tragic figure if there ever was one and again the cast pulls together to deliver a fine incredible family movie that is worth watching over and over again. Richard Harris is sorely missed but Michael Dearborn fills Dumbledore's shoes very nicely indeed. One of my all time top favorite movies.
451,,Meet Sirius Black .,Chris Columbus did an excellent job setting up the world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts with two exciting kids movies which adults could also greatly enjoy. Alfonso Cuarón manages to capture the same sense of magic while taking things to the next level in various ways.
452,9,"Great cinematography and music, my favourite Harry Potter movie","It may seem strange to say this about a film that already runs over two hours and twenty minutes, but ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" needs to be longer by fifteen minutes at the very least. The story is a complex one, by Potter standards, and way too many vital plot points race by up on the screen before they can really sink in. A person who had not read the book will likely not be able to tell what the hell is going on (but then that raises the question, do people who haven't read the books actually go to these movies?). "
453,,"""Look"" is Cool, But Story Hopelessly Truncated",I checked the Goblet of Fire director and thank god it's not Alfonso Cuarón.
454,1,Can this new director!,"Ok, this is just a joke. Of course I can´t and I wouldn´t be a wizard. But it would be good if I had the power. Being at Hogwarts would certainly be a great adventure!!! As you can see, I really loved this third Harry Potter´s adventure. It´s intelligent and has lots of action. For the first time, the novel had some of its facts left out. Alfonso Cuaron didn´t do as Chris Columbus did. He selected the most important facts and turned them into this great movie picture. I´m not criticizing Columbu`s job. The first film (made by him) is the best of the already released three ones. But Cuaron had to work with the slowest paced story of all the novels about Potter. Cuaron also created a dark atmosphere. Everything is dark all long the story. There`s also lots of special effects and supernatural facts."
455,8,I wanna be a wizard too!,"My wife & I REALLY wanted to like this movie. We really did. We tried as open-mindedly as possible. We finally managed to stay awake for the entire run on our fourth try. The plot is vague, the pace is slow, and the film wanders about in a floundering sort of way. Characters are thrown in at the last minute (eg: Peter Pettigrew) who are immensely important to Harry Potter's life, but about whom the movie manages to make us care just about zero. ""Azkaban"" touches on much but delves into little, including feeble and fleeting flirtations with Hermioine's maturing sense of sexuality (Who's hand is she holding now? Is that HIS neck she's hugging? Why is she wearing that undersized sweatshirt instead of the Hogwarts robe?)."
456,4,Not that great,"This movie is great, everything in the movi feels right in its place, and it was this movie which set the mood for the other movies in the future, the grey tones, the new designs, the sthetic, etc. This was the peak of Harry Potter."
457,9,Best Harry Potter movie,"Great direction, great writing and great performances make the Prisoner of Azkaban a fantastic step up from the previous two installments (and even some future ones to)"
458,10,A big step up,"So I never saw the second Harry Potter, but a few weeks back on a bus to New York City, I saw the third Harry Potter film. Sure the conditions were less than adequate for viewing such a would-be mega movie, but it managed to keep me occupied on the trip down."
459,7,Internal/darker Harry Potter,"Absolutely outstanding special effects. Daniel Radcliffe bounce back into acting his third Harry Potter movie; Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban. Things get challenging for Harry in this movie, he finds out that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come for him. As Harry is in Hogwarts School with his fellow friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermonie (Emma Watson)he faces new classes such as approaching Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and learning about shape shifting Boggarts and how to transform them in to something hilarious. Then Harry's worries of Sirus Black are getting deeper, when he founds out that he is lurking around the Hogwarts grounds to find Harry.Also soul-sucking deadly dementours are also lurking outside the castle walls...Harry has a lot of mysteries to face in his third year of Hogwarts...Especially Peter Petingrove...Daniel Racliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and the cast all deserve an Oscar for all their hard work and achievements. Also, I understand the crew spended millions of money to make this magical movie for us, so they should all deserve an Oscar for that as well. I would recommend this movie to people ages 7+ despite the lack of fantasy. So grab your popcorn and snuggle up in the sofa and watch it."
460,10,Tremendous,"The third in the Harry Potter was definitely worth the wait.  I didn't get a chance to finish the book before going to the movie so I cannot comment on how it compares to the book, but I loved this movie.  The film is literally darker than the previous two movies.  There are a lot of scenes where it is raining or snowing outside, did I go into The Day After Tomorrow by mistake? Just kidding.  Anyway, Harry must unravel what The Prisoner Of Azkaban has to do with before he gets killed.  The actors are all superb, particularly the actor who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumblebore. I like how the main characters are growing up in these movies.  I look forward to seeing more adventures of Harry, Hermonie, and Ronald in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire."
461,10,Worth the wait,"It's plain that the new director had never read the book - let alone the ten or twenty times many of this movie's viewers have. 90% of the effort went into special effects, to the total detriment of the story. It's as if the director decided he'd film every 20th page in the book, so great were the flying leaps over whole sections of plot. Not a lick-and-a-promise, but rather ignoring the in-between material entirely, as if it didn't matter to the story. Several VERY important scenes from the book that were vital to understanding the plot - such as the explanation of how Sirius, James and Peter had become animagi while still at Hogwarts - were apparently not deemed necessary for the movie. Before seeing this movie I would have thought it inconceivable that I could walk out of a Harry Potter film wanting my money back, but it happened. I sincerely hope that Chris Columbus takes back the helm for Goblet of Fire...!"
462,1,A wonderful book made into a perfectly awful movie.,"I just saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (HP&PoA) tonight. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed."
463,1,Alfonso Cuaron should be sacked for his slaughtering of HP&PoA,"Well I just saw HP3 and I must say that I am very disappointed. So many plot elements were left out (quidditch cup; moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs remain unexplained) that I had to sit down with a friend who had never read the books for half an hour afterwards to explain pretty much the entire story. Also, I do not get the same feel for Hogwarts and the wizarding world as when Chris Columbus directed. I mean, the kids were wearing common street clothes most of the movie, which was ridiculous. Hardly any actual ""wizarding"" took place, and the climax scene where Harry produces the patronus was terribly done. During the first two movies I felt like I was taken into the wizarding world, whereas in PoA I felt like I was watching some kids running around trying to solve a mystery while some neat special effects happened. I am extremely disappointed and I'm just glad that the next movie will feature a new director."
464,3,Terrible Directing leads to an extremely disappointing film,"Not only does ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" manage to shed most of the syrupy ""kid-stuff"" atmosphere of its predecessors, it comes amazingly close to the status of a true fantasy classic."
465,9,The best so far...,"Alfonso Cuarón is probably one of the most eclectic directors in all of Hollywood. I first became interested in him after viewing the film Y Tu Mamá También, and began to devour his other works including Great Expectations and A Little Princess. Every film of his is a gem, and completely different from the previous, but the one film that really stood out in my mind as a showcase of his work was, incredibly enough, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I am by no means a very big Harry Potter fan. Yes, I've read the books, and yes I've seen the movies, but they were never really a very big deal for me, like they were for some of my peers. What drew my attention to the film was the attachment of Alfonso Cuarón to the job of directing."
466,8,Harry's Even More Magical World,"The pacing of this movie is actually brilliant, and the ending is just fantastic."
467,7,Nice!,"I love the actors of every part of this movie. I really enjoyed the adventure and all of the magic that was here. I think that it was the best part. I like that they became friends with the prisoner at the end and help him escape the execution. I think that their acting skills were so good althrough they were like 13 in this part. This part started. This part started with them going to the Hogwarts school knowing that the prisoner escaped and going for them to their school. They solved that he isn't actually a bad guy, so they decided to help him. It ended up. It ended up them helping him so he doesn't get killed."
468,10,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Where it's sequels and prequels lack, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is better. Unfortunately, it doesn't match up to 'Chamber's' excellent suspense and story, and the action is nowhere near 'Goblet'. But what you do have is a well rounded and fun flick for the whole family. Filled with a stellar cast and a great coming of age story, Harry Potter 3 is a real winner."
469,10,"not the best, but the most well done all around","It's difficult for me to comment on this movie in an unbiased fashion, since I am an avid fan of the books. However, I am not the kind of person who automatically thinks that any change of the story from the book is a bad thing."
470,1,I have never cringed more in my life than in the hours I spent watching this.,"Now this is my least favourite of the series and I just cannot place my hands on why, the film has stellar acting performances by all cast and crew and the film keeps to the book quite well but the only problem was, was that it did not keep the same vibe the 1st and 2nd one had. In this third film, Harry becomes a lot more wise, he is now having to face Demeter's and is continuing his feud with Draco Malfoy but overall I do not think the film came off. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and I love the ultimate darkness of the films following but there is something about the unfolding of this one that does not feel right. I think this film overall was OK and deserves to be watched by Harry Potter fans everywhere. I rate it 63%."
471,6,Took a dark turn here and it was certainly a move to the future.,"One thing I really like about the Harry Potter movies is that they are not sentimentalised, babyish, immature trash that is only made for kids and babies whose parents don't wish to scare them - they are all gripping, dark, scary, and actually have brains behind them that will please the adults as well. This film is no exception - it is probably the darkest of all Potter's adventures so far, and easily lives up to the title of a worthy Harry Potter adaptation. The opening scenes with Aunt Marge are very funny, but after that - the adventure begins - and it is dark from the off. The Dementor scene on the train is stunningly and grippingly done, and this film has a real sense of mystery and intrigue to it. John Williams' classic score is once again used to great effect, Hagrid actually has some kind of a soul in this film, and the ending is a superbly done close to another great Harry Potter film. This might have been the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is by no means the worst. Another thumbs-up is the credits sequence - hugely original, and a great end to 2004's greatest fantasy film! Potter's third adventure will not fail to disappoint! 9/10"
472,9,Probably the darkest Harry Potter film yet - this film is one to be reckoned with!,"The first movie was okay, it helped to set the scene. The second movie was okay as well, although it was pretty much just a small change in plot."
473,8,"Visually has improved, story is starting to get better","I have just got back from the cinema, where I caught the first showing of the latest in the Harry Potter saga."
474,8,"A new director, A new formula but the same old magic.","I feel obligated to preface this review by saying I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I haven't read any of the books, and this may surprise you, but I haven't seen either of the first two movies. So I'm asking all you Harry Potter marks not to cry too hard at the fact that this review won't be a total praise-fest. OK, now that I've gotten that out of the way, we may proceed."
475,,An honest review from a non-fan,The best Potter so far. The third installment in Harry Potter is a better movie in every way then the first two.
476,8,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004),"I HATED this Harry Potter. It was murder on the books and they changed everything. They changed the location of Hagrid's hut. They let the kids run around in street clothes. They changed the music. This one just sucked in general. I mean some of the graphics were okay, but it didn't just meet up to the first two. Maybe it was because of the new director of the movie. The creatures were real cool. They changed some of the characters and there wasn't much of the old excitement as there was in the older movies. Another example of changing location was the hotel where Harry stayed at in the first 2 was run by a different tom and it was as befuddled. Another thing was that it was next to a train track. In the first movie. It wasn't anywhere near a train track. So ill say it again, this one stinks!!! I'm a big fan of Harry Potter. I own every movie except this one, because its so bad, thats how bad it is."
477,1,It stunk!!!,"I love the wonderful casting choices the directors of these films consistently make!  Emma Thompson as Professor Trelawny was an inspired choice!  What a hoot.  I wish the filmmakers hadn't cut this film to ribbons, though.  Clearly, there must have been other scenes featuring ""the emmas"" (Watson and Thompson).  In the book, if I remember right, there are lots more sparks that fly between the two.  I wanted to see more of Emma Thompson!  Also, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was absolutely marvelous.  I sure hope he signs on for the future films.  He's always been a favorite of mine, anyway.  I was unfamiliar with David Thewlis, but he was awesome as well as Professor Lupin.  He managed to be weird and slightly menacing as well as a friendly mentor to Harry.  The film felt a bit ""rushed"" as many points were left out (who, for example are Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail, and Prongs??...the only reason I know is that I read the book.  I wonder if those who haven't were completely lost...would it really have taken THAT long to explain who they were???)  Many of the scenes felt rushed and the dialog was a bit contrived to move the plot along.  I know this is often the nature of the translation of books to film; I don't think this film would have suffered had it been 30 minutes longer.  But don't get me wrong.  IT was a fine film and we all enjoyed it.  Yes, it's a bit darker than the others (I was SHOCKED to see many many toddlers in the audience!!  Hello, people??  What are you thinking????  Do you not read?  Every review I've seen warns against taking small children to this as it is quite scary.)  but older elementary kids and up will be fine, for the most part."
478,6,"Not quite as good as the other two, but almost","One of my absolute Harry Potter favorites. I really like how they turned the book into the movie. The special effects are really nice - in some cases I would even say better than in later HP movies since, in my opinion, they really seem to capture the essence of the book."
479,10,Great work,"The Harry Potter movies have never got special treatment from their Directors.   It's fair to say also they were never treated in the same way the Lord of the Rings was but Harry Potter has time against it where Peter Jackson had the money and the time to play around to make it the masterpiece it became.  When reading every Harry Potter book you can easily believe that they could be even better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy with all the twist and turns every thread hole of the story has and thats not including the amount of characters portrayed through the mammoth story.  Philosopher's Stone was good, Chamber of Secrets was very Good and Prisoner of Azakaban was Good but not great.   When Gary Oldman comes into the picture , it is where the films begins to become what we had hoped but till then I think there was huge cuts made in parts where questions were left unanswered.   I know there is always an occurring argument over the films and how much they miss out from the books but this films was nearly twenty minutes shorter than The Chamber of Secrets so they could have easily added more scenes to the films to make up the time.  Film distributors believe that for a child to watch a film then it must be short in time but a child gets lost in films and as long as the film is Magical like Harry Potter then they get lost and have no idea what time even means when watching something like this.  "
480,,"Could have been great, but as always it wasn't",Possible Mild Spoilers . . .
481,1,"Ignore the hype, it's not as good as The Chamber of Secrets","After a less than passable second film, the Harry Potter series got back to greatness as Alfonso Cuarón took place in the director's chair for Prisoner of Azkaban and gave Hogwarts a whole new style I very much enjoyed. "
482,,Visually the best and generally one of the best of the series,POSSIBLE SPOILERS
483,,Good but not amazing,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens."
484,7,Okay,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the one Harry Potter I remember.
485,7,"Harry Potter now has more storyline, mystery and entertainment- enough to fill your satisfaction","I had been looking forward to Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, since I saw the Chamber of Secrets ... and as the story goes, I was sorely disappointed. Having read the comments from ""movie specialist"" and critics in papers and on various TV-channels I had really high expectations - but I was let down. Why? Because although the movie had much better acting skills (at least from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint I was grieved to see Emma Thompsons characterization of professor Trelawney. Not good enough by a long shot. The editing was so so. The direction was probably very good from a movie technical point of view - but ..."
486,6,Sorely needed: An extended version,"The first thing you will notice about the third Harry Potter movie is that the direction is completely different from the first two. Azkaban is much darker, more enchanted and, let's face it, a much more grown up movie than the previous two. Harry Potter is growing up! And whether this is a good or bad thing is left for the viewer to decide. One thing for certain is the series is truly going down a more darker, more sinister path."
487,7,Two Thumbs Up.,"I was thoroughly lukewarm on the first two Harry Potter films, and though I was a little intrigued because this new installment was directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), I still wouldn't say I was looking FORWARD to it. "
488,8,"Wow, and I didn't even LIKE the first two (***1/2)","This film is painful to watch. The tone is way off base. There's something contrived in its whacky feel, shifting away from the grounded feel of the first two films, something Columbus got right, capturing the 'spirit' of the books, a feel which was natural to the characters."
489,3,One of the worst...,Prisoner of Azkaban does a great job of taking what was great about the first two and adding a darker feel to it.
490,9,One of the best in the franchise,"This movie is excellent. I love it. I give it, 10 out of 10 stars. Everything in it is great, acting, costumes, production, cinematography, script, directing, and set decoration. The sky is awesome. All the other things were awesome too."
491,10,Excellent Movie!,I was found of it when i was young and it was released. And still found of it when my baby's able to watching films. Best HP movie in my opinion.
492,10,My favorite HP movie ever,"So many things were out of character, and definitely out of pace with the previous movies. I understand that it strays from the book, the whole movie series has a life of its own and it has been great so far, leaving enough surprises to be found in the books for those who didn't get to read them first. "
493,,Worst director in the Potter series,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) goes through his third year at Hogwarts and has to deal with convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who has escaped from Azkaban prison.
494,7,Decent fare for non-readers. Some fans will be disappointed.,"Once again the expansion of the Potter Universe is brilliantly executed, showing more quirks and details in some of the magical ways in which wizards and witches get around in the ""normal world""."
495,8,Best so far in the series....,I have recently decided to watch the Harry Potter films from start to finish on Netflix. I have never read the books so I am not comparing the stories in these films from the novels.
496,2,Unimaginative and Unoriginal.,"The film version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is not that bad. Acceptable, in fact. What upsets me is it could have been so much more."
497,7,"OK, but could have been outstanding.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter film that is not directed by Chris Columbus. The film is directed by Alfonso Cuarón and it really shows. This film no longer has that magical feeling throughout that the first two had. Instead, the characters are not always surprised and shocked when something magical happens and instead they act a lot like teenagers. The movie is dark, and it really shows how the characters begin to grow up as that magical feeling no longer exists. This is a good thing, in my opinion and this movie is superior than the first two as well. The story is deeper and we get to know some pretty cool characters, it is very dark and very well constructed. But what makes this the best Harry Potter entry so far is the cinematography and directing by Alfonso Cuarón. Every shot looks beautiful, raw and phenomenal. The special effects also get much better in this one and it's just a better movie overall. The pacing is great and the acting is very good as well. This is a great fantasy movie."
498,10,Things are getting pretty dark...,"I have read every book of the Harry Potter series and have liked everyone of them except for this one. This movie in my opinion strays way too far away from the book, and fails to hit all the key points of the book. I hated the ending of this film, as harry flying on his thunderbolt to a freeze frame was lame( Really never end a movie like that), and the exclusion of the quidditch house cup, a huge part of the novel is something that hurts this film. I also don't like any of the rest of this film, or at least its adaptation of the book, which was one of my favorites of the Harry Potter Series. The only movie I would compare this to in terms of being weak is the Half Blood prince, but that gets a pass, as it was much longer than this one. All in all, as much as I love the books, and liked all of the movies except for this one, this movie sucks big time compared to the book"
499,,"Huge Potter Fan, but this Movie sucks","I liked this one better than the second one. I don't know what it was, but something about this movies tone and mood, as well as the way it was crafted together gave me a better feeling for it. Now directed by a new director, a lot of things have changed, including the cinematography, the visuals, the plots, and altogether the directing. This one is more adventurous, more loose, more fitting with the book, and a lot more progressing."
500,7,A slight improvement over the second.,"This is the best movie of the whole series, that says a lot"
501,10,Best one,"Thus far this was the worst movie in the series. My family and I are staunch readers of the Potter series and were exceedingly disappointed in this movie. I can not understand why Chris Columbus stopped directing. He was true to the story and the elements which are necessary to the plot. I disagree with putting the Hogwarts students int to ""muggle"" clothing. It takes away from the feel of the movie. Dressing differently is part of the whole package. They are not meant to be like ""us""."
502,1,An unfortunate waste of time and money.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban begins with a slow pace, but not in a dull setting, the pace matches the setting very well. The story telling ability is on a showcase through the last few scenes of the film, as it pieces everything together magnetically. This film was brilliant!"
503,8,Brilliant,"I was very disappointed by the changes in this movie. There was unneeded scenes of Hermoine achieving ""girl power"" as Draco gets beaten up... there's no ""magical"" feeling and all the wonderful music of the first two movies no longer exists... really lame jokes such as beating Ron's cast were scattered through out. everyone looks more ""hip"" with modern clothes. If anything, Potter has been dumbed down to standard pre-teen movie jokes. This was mostly the first half of the movie. The first half very much rushed the scenes of importance and jumped around so much that a non-reader would be totally confused. Instead of adding things that were unnecessary the huge plot of book three could have had more time to let each scene be presented. The Shrieking Shack scene was wonderful for the most part... the ""married couple"" line was exceptionally amusing. Oldman and Thewlis were superb... sadly Snape has little character in this movie at all. The ending on the Firebolt really destroyed the feeling of this being an ""epic"" sort of story... lack of closure. So, if anything I can rave about Sirius and Remus but otherwise, I found much of the movie ridiculous and unnecessary and lacking. 6/10"
504,3,Lacking that bit of magic and sanity,"Being an avid reader of the books and an admirer of the last two adaptations I was obviously looking forward to this new release. And whilst I realize the genuine impossibility of a literal interpretation of the books events I have some genuine problems with the film. For one, the layout of Hogwarts changed entirely from that of the first two films. The Whomping Willow is in a completely different position, as is Hagrid's hut. Important explanations were also omitted such as the reasons for Lupin and Black transforming in to their animal forms and the relevance of the stag. The short ending also left a lot of things up in the air....including Harry!! Much of this is surely to do with the introduction of a new director. However, surely with the foreknowledge that all seven books will one day be made in to film then some continuity is needed. The film did have some saving graces. The Hippogriff was very good as were the dementors and Harry and Hermiones time travel sequence. Yet all in all I can not help but feel a little let down that such a classic novel has not been done justice."
505,1,very disappointed,I will tell you....the third installment goes almost completely away from the book. I was flabbergasted to see the Alfonso was allowed to butcher JK's book as much as he did. It was really sad. As I don't want to ruin the movie for others I will not go into detail except to say that the movie strays from the book on several occasions. There was little to no flow for the first hour of the movie and it seemed like it was a mish mash of scenes just thrown together. All I can say is thank God Alfonso won't be directing any more of the movies. The saddest part is that the acting was so over done that it lacked the punch and the zest of the acting in the first two movies. Even Daniel seemed to be lacking his typical flow.
506,3,Worst of the Three by far,"I didn't really wanted to see this movie. Why? Because I was 24 years old student who really grew up from this kind of movies. Luckily, that year I was involved in a project of helping problematic kids. So I had an eleven years old boy to look after. Naturally when we decided to go to the cinema together he was the one to choose the film. "
507,8,For every kid,HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the third installment of the HARRY POTTER film series and it is directed by Alfonso Cuaron.
508,10,The best of the Harry Potter movies!,"Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban, was a real trip to watch. In this movie my especially favorite parts were when Hermione punches Draco in the face after a rude comment. As well as some other hilarious parts, this movie was very very enjoyable. I especially love the plots crazy time turning moments where you really have to pay attention. I've never read the books but after seeing this wondrous movie I am on my way to the nearest bookstore to find them all! I'm really looking forward to Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2, So in conclusion, I know this doesn't really reveal a lot about the plot so yes."
509,10,This movie was by far one of the best out of the whole series!,"I know that many of the readers of the books, those that post on IMDb anyway, and the critical mass hailed this as the first authentic recreation of the universe that Rowling created. Again, I come to these films totally ignorant of the books, however, for me, the criticism of Columbus' first 2 films in the franchise is nitpicking. Further, the praise given to this film I think is overdone."
510,8,Darker isn't always better,"I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week."
511,9,"Darker, but definitely more magical",By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.
512,7,Improvement on the first two movies,"The third of the Potter films is, by far, the visually most impressive one. The not-so-great effects from previous films are all gone, and replaced by some top notch work. Also, the overall look and feel of the film is darker and more interesting than before. That said, there are still huge problems."
513,4,Strike three,"What comes to the mind when magic is heard- none other than Harry Potter, What can you do if things go wrong- simple travel to the past and mend the things-- haha. This is an interesting fantasy wherein Harry and Hermoine dive into the past and help Buckbeak and Sirius Black. More interesting was Patronus charm in which Harry helps himself and Sirius. Magic with elements of friendship, sacrifice, betrayals give this movie a great stature. Enjoyed it all through."
514,9,Amazing,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuaron, created the best film as of yet, and arguably the best film of the saga! Cuaron crafted some absolutely gorgeous shots, with beautiful cinematography, popping off the screen with a great color pallet. He brings a lot of style to this film, incorporating many long takes, emotional close ups, with seamless editing, that helped the film stand on it's own. Instead of keeping the film more lighthearted, Cuaron brings this darker tone, that elevates the saga to new heights! Chris Columbus seemed to have a tough time focusing on the premise, and fleshing it out, but Cuaron did a fantastic job keeping the narrative tight and cohesive, while still keeping the continuity of the saga. Cuaron utilized amazing imagery, to create a lot of suspense, and twists throughout the narrative, allowing for countless memorable moments! I really don't have many issues with the story or direction; the only nitpicks I have, is that they incorporated a few filler scenes and exposition dumps, but they made things as interesting and entertaining as possible."
515,9,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) leaves early for Hogwarts after blowing up his aunt (literally) and quickly finds out that a man named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from a high-security prison called Azkaban and may attempt to kill Harry. Harry also learns that Sirius Black is partly responsible for the murdering of his parents and was a big supporter of Lord Voldemort.
516,8,The magic that I have been waiting for...,"Now we're getting to the meaty stuff. Harry cops an attitude! As the children become adolescents, the filmmaking skills surrounding them mature also. Alfonso Cuarón confidently adopts and revitalises a well established cinematic world designed by Chris Columbus. The visual effects are now tighter than ever; the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking; and Radcliffe and his teenage co-stars are now steady on their feet."
517,9,"This one looks and sounds better, and feels awesome too","Direction wise, and screenplay-wise this third outing actually works pretty good. Its got cohesion, and it has its payoffs... if you would settle for a morbid ending, then you'll be disappointed, but if you can appreciate cohesion, you won't feel cheated."
518,,Too cute no longer.,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Cuaron, 2004), the third film in the Harry Potter series still remains my favorite of all. Not only is this movie about good conquering evil, it is also a coming of age movie for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson). This movie continually shows how Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown and matured into their roles. The film also shows how the friendships and the bonds among the three have strengthened and grown as well. Hermione, in particular has grown into a strong adversary for Harry, not only her knowledge but her skills with magic and her wand have also improved. Above all, she deeply cares for Harry and is as pure and good as he is. Ron continues to offer some comedic relief as he grows and we love watching him. The main plot of the film is that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) who was imprisoned for his part in Harry's parent's deaths has escaped Azkaban prison and is coming for Harry. The role of Sirius Black seemed to be made perfectly for Gary Oldman. He portrays Sirius with such tenacity that you find yourself fearing him and at the same time falling for him because you see goodness in him. Ultimately we are cheering for him when we find he was not to blame for Harry's parent's deaths and that he loved them dearly as well as Harry and that he is Harry's Godfather. Harry continues to fight the Dark Lord and his followers throughout the film. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) continues his role as the nasty and unfathomable character we have grown to despise because of his harsh treatment of Harry and the underlying notion that he is fighting on the side of the Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes) and betraying Dumbledore (Michael Sambon). The story behind this movie continues to be gripping from beginning to end. It opens with Harry struggling with his family and the struggles only increasing, to Harry struggling with the fear and reality that Sirius is coming for him and ending with Harry struggling over the threat of Voldermort coming after him. I believe what makes this film so intriguing to the fans of Harry Potter is how true it has remained to the novels. J.K. Rowling has done a magnificent job of bringing these characters and the magic to life in her novels and the reward of seeing them as we imagined while reading on screen is phenomenal. The film continues to open up new avenues for our imaginations to expand with the twists and turns. The continual use of images moving in paintings, stair cases moving and ghosts floating around Hogwarts gives the audience the overall illusion that magic truly does exist. Even though we do not see as much of the Dementors, the special lighting used allows the viewer to feel their looming, dark presence overshadowing the school. The special effects used when Harry is using the invisibility cloak and seeing his foot prints on the map help the audience to have a sense of moving along with him quietly and softly. Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing such a fantastic series of books. The Harry Potter novels and films are truly something I will cherish for years to come. I fell in love with the characters in the books and only hoped that the movies would portray them as I had imagined. In reality, the films were much more than I could have asked for. It was a great experience watching the characters grow, endure and triumph over tragedy and evil."
519,10,Third and Best Film of All in the Harry Potter Series,"Prisoner of Azkaban is a major fan favorite in the Harry Potter fandom. This is ultimately due to the godlike aesthetic the film has. The coloring has much darker and bluer tones than the first films. The lighting is also way darker, reflecting the darker tones of the story. The music carries a different kind of magical enchantment compared to John Williams' early work in the franchise. And the costumes are altered completely, also adding to a new freshness that we see in the 3rd movie."
520,10,All time Favorite in the Franchise!,"Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films were good, and they did a fine job of setting up the Harry Potter universe; but there was something missing from those films. They both lacked a style of their own. Now comes Alfonso Cuaron, whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has style to burn, as well as plenty of substance. Screenwriter Steven Kloves makes many noticeable changes to J.K. Rowling's masterful novel, and the result is a great script. Kloves brings in his own dialogue, and it works; there are plenty of great one-liners. Several subplots had to go to make the film fit (I missed the Quidditch Cup storyline most of all), but it was all for the best. Among the regular castmembers, Emma Watson continues to be the big discovery of this series. Hermione was already my favourite character in the books, but Watson takes the character several steps higher. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint also do great work here. Michael Gambon is great as Albus Dumbledore, bringing to the screen the quirkiness and uniqueness that was largely absent from Richard Harris's portrayal of the Headmaster (no offense is meant to Harris, who was in the twilight of his life at the time, and seemed too tired). David Thewlis is wonderful as Professor Remus Lupin, although I hadn't pictured Lupin as having a moustache. Gary Oldman, likewise, is excellent as Sirius Black."
521,10,"Rich, atmospheric, and one hell of a ride.","Having read all 5 books, I can safely says this one has the most faithful adaptation from the book - yet I do miss Richard Harris and hope Michael Eamon can keep up (although he seems to be closer to the book's version of Dumbledore)!"
522,,"On Parole, hope Goblet has more 2 offer!",Alfonso Cuarón's excellent direction allows the Harry Potter universe to seamlessly transition from the lighthearted prequels to the darker and heavier themed sequels.
523,8,2nd favorite of the series,"This film improves on the previous two in nearly every single way. It looks a lot better, whether we're talking about the special effects or hogwarts. Speaking of the way this film looks, it is one of the best looking Harry Potter films. In my opinion, even the music got better! Overall, this was a great adaptation of the equally enjoyable book that made me very excited to watch Goblet of Fire."
524,9,Better Than the First Two in Nearly Every Way,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/2004/***1/2
525,9,Not as good as the first two but still very imaginative and dark!,"In which Harry escapes from his relatives, goes somewhere a bit weird, gets told the plot, goes to school, sorts everything out.  The usual, in other words.  Except, hang on a second, this time around something is different. My eyelids are not feeling incredibly heavy.  Soul-crushing boredom is not infusing every fibre of my being.  I'm not spending most of the film's running-time staring at the back of someone's head in an effort to get them to turn round.  What on earth has happened?  Until now the HP franchise was a guaranteed insomnia cure.  What has gone wrong?  Slick direction, a not-appalling script, even - gadzooks - tolerable performances from the kids, all are present in this latest instalment.  True, the usual ingredients are also there - an endless roll-call of loveable Brit thesps (Emma, Dawn, Robbie, Maggie, etc.), banal plotting in the early stages that doesn't really make much sense, Daniel Radcliffe's impossible-to-like hero, computer-generated sequences that don't fit into the rest of the movie at all.  But somehow this thing actually works.  The director, Alfonso Cuaron, might be partly to blame.  Cuaron has managed to bring a certain sense of threat and menace to the whole affair.  The camera (or its computerised counterpart) glides eerily through a snow-bound Hogwarts school, the plot rattles along at a decent pace, the performers acquit themselves reasonably well, and one or two scenes actually look a little informal, a little relaxed, as though the people involved are perhaps even enjoying themselves.  That sense of relaxed enjoyment was always missing from HP movies before - everything was spectacular and over-the-top and energetic, but none of it looked like fun to be involved in, and certainly none of it was fun to watch.  But with HP 3 the performers seem more realistic and relaxed while the plot (always a conspicuous absentee from the previous movies) is tightened-up and, to a certain extent, makes sense. In fact I am not ashamed to say that the last twenty minutes are actually pretty good. "
526,,Not utterly rubbish,I thought this third installment of the Harry Potter movies was lacking. lacking of the charm that the first two movies had. The storyline was muddled and thrown together two quickly
527,7,not as good as the first,This third movie is the best movie of harry potter. is magnific
528,10,the best movie of harry potter,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", despite what you might be led to believe, is not an overly curious, ""scary"" installment to the ""Potter"" franchise. It's a harmless, sometimes tepid, children's adventure into the world of magic, featuring Potter and company on the search for an escaped convict who is luring about Hogwarts. Sometimes, the adventure of ""Potter"" can be vivacious, lurid, and effervescent, particularly the zany tour bus rescue chase. Then again, it has its tedious and complacent qualities, particularly when the ""heroes"" band together to solve the great mystery at hand, and the congenial, whimsical theme of magic is deviated to one of impish and tepid ""mystery"". Call me an ignorant cynic, who has yet to read a single ""Potter"" book, but as a curious film buff who demands a degree of action, comedic, and intelligent qualities in my movies, there were some very long, eventless sequences in this film which had me perplexed and even tired. Of course, a vibrant premise such as this must have a conflict, yet the idea of junior wizards exploiting a dangerous criminal was a tad too juvenile for me to enjoy. The film succeeds in its dazzling tale of a world of magic spells, congenial haunts, and zany escapades, yet not quite enough satisfaction to warrant a genuine recommendation. However, it's the fairest ""Potter"" yet, if that's worth acknowledging. **1/2 out of ****"
529,,"Effervescent, If Impish ""Potter"" Installment",(spoilers) This Potter film is not worth seeing. Fans will be sorely
530,,Sub-Par,"I was surely NOT disappointed when I saw this movie, I thought that the change of director was the best thing that happened to this series. He didn't rely on too many special effects to create such a wonderful adaptation of J.K Rowling's third novel. It's great to see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint have really grown into their roles and I think we can expect even more greater things as each novel is made in the future."
531,10,fantastic!,"(spoilers) I resisted going to see this film in the theater because it is my favorite of all the Harry Potter books, and I didn't want to see it butchered. I only watched it because I got a copy free at the grocery store for buying 60 bucks worth of groceries that I would have bought anyway. So I finally watched it, and was horrified and appalled."
532,,Pure and utter crap,"I went to see this movie, with the knowledge that I had seen the first two and liked both of them. They weren't my favorites, but I did really like them. When I went to see this movie I was very disappointed. I felt like the director didn't stay true to the book the way Chris Columbus had. A lot of the main plot scenes, were either cut out, rushed, or completely changed."
533,1,"rushed, and changed","Being a loyal Harry Potter fan I went to see this movie as soon as possible. Prisoner of Azkaban is a great book, my favorite, but this movie was so far from the book that I hated it. They took out everything that was important and added filler that did not need to be there. Also they had alignment with book problems. Such as, when Harry got his firebolt. Though the acting and all that stuff were excellent. In fact anyone who has not read the books will love the movie, but As I see it it was horrible. By far the worst Harry Potter movie yet. I am pleased to say though that there is another new director for movie four and I am confident that he will do a better job than Alfonso Cuaron. Though this movie in the eyes of a book reader is horrible it is still a great movie and I recommend seeing."
534,1,This movie was ruined.,"I was sad when Richard Harris died as I wondered what would happen to the series. I was glad when they said they were not going to stop filming them and had cast Michael Gambon in the role. He does an admirable job but I found his slight Irish twang to be odd, I know he is trying to be different from Richard Harris but it is a little bit silly as it comes and goes."
535,10,My favourite so far,"A great movie, by Cuaron. A mature tone setting which sets it out from its prequels. Although a major part from the book has been excluded, still the rest stands out as OUTSTANDING. Especially the scenes of the Marauder's Map. Also there are plenty of comedy in the movie. There is a hint of a budding romance between Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends. Also the sound and music of the movie is especially awesome. John Williams has left all of us spellbound by his ingenuinity. The portion where young Professor Lupin tells Potter about his parents is magnified by the outstanding slow background music. (A Window To The Past) And most important of all is the deadly ""villain"", Sirius Black, who also happens to Harry's godfather. Although this movie lacks Quidditch, it has Buckbeak the Hippogriff flying over the Lake in the Castle. Overall it's a definite must see for all HP fans."
536,9,A Mature HP Movie,"I had my doubts about this film when I learned that Alfonso Cuaron was to take the director's chair, but they proved to be completely irrational. This film is easily the best of the Potters, excelling in nearly every area. Alfonso brings a new, very spooky quality to the film franchise that was much needed. His new Hogwarts set is perfect for the third film, which was meant to be dark and different. For instance, the pumpkin patch and the ""floating"" walkway give off a very mystical and Halloween-ish aura. In addition, Cuaron and the set designers actually reinforced the themes of the film in every aspect. The newly designed gears and clock chime in the castle reinforce time, which is of utmost importance in the film. Also worth mentioning is the overall look of the characters and visuals."
537,10,The Best Potter Film: Alfonso Delivers,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban lacked CONTINUITY with the previous Harry Potter Movies. Taking the reigns from Chris Columbus was a huge task and unfortunately Alfonso Cuaron wasn't up to the task. The first thing that you will notice during is that the cinematography is quite different than the previous movies. I know that the third installment of J.K. Rowling's series was darker than the other two books but Alfonso Cuaron actually made the cinematography darker also. It reminded me of the SciFi movie ""Pitch Black."""
538,1,"Continuity, What Continuity?","One thing that is immediately noticeable after the end of this third movie is that you just watched a movie with much less comedy in it. That's neither good nor bad, just different. Hope the kids don't get too scared."
539,9,"less comedic, more horrific",This movie was a huge disappointment. Major points were left out while minor or unimportant points were embellished upon. This movie needed to follow the book more closely and probably be longer. (How did they expect to make a longer book into a shorter movie?) 
540,4,The telling of the third book in the Harry Potter series.,"This is a good movie. It has everything that makes the Harry Potter movies great. But it takes a bit of time till things really start moving. The final though is great, and full of good action."
541,9,"Good, but not as good as the 2nd part","Don't believe the hype-- while director Alfonso Cuaron may have provided a slightly more gothic feel to this third Harry Potter franchise Happy Meal, the guiding spirit here is still that of Warner Brothers' executive suite (and promotions department), and he is no more able to transcend the existing problems with these adaptations than a Lee Tamahori or a Michael Apted has been able to impress the stamp of his own personality upon the James Bond franchise.  "
542,,Another tedious Potter movie from Warner Bros.' factory,"I've read and heard many stories about Rowling wanting, before Columbus took charge, Gilliam as a director for a Harry Potter movie. Sure it would have been great... but didn't come true (as many dreams about the movie industry..)."
543,8,"Family movie with guts? Oh Oh, things look brighter...","The third film of the 'Harry Potter' franchise, 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is a very good fantasy film dealing with wizardry (though, if you are to watch this, you already know what 'Harry Potter' is about). With the change in direction, this film marks a deviation from the more childish style of Chris Columbus first two films, with a darker, more sinister tone employed by Alfonso Cuaron."
544,8,Visually excellent book adaptation; a darker turn for the series,"I anticipated the film version of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" with a mixture of excitement and dread.  Excitement, because the third installment in JK Rowling's series is my favorite, and dread because the dialogue-and-exposition heavy story struck me as one which could easily be screwed up on screen.  Done right, it could lift the series to new heights; done wrong, it could easily kill the franchise."
545,,Truly enchanting,"When I first saw this, like most people I saw how the children are getting older. The first two films were good but this film is better. Some say that Harry shows his dark side when he takes revenge on Aunt Marge by blowing her up like a balloon but I personally was completely on his side after what she said about his parents. The scene with the Knight Bus is great. But the films are getting more sinister. A case in point is when the train is halted on the Glenfinnan Viaduct, everything goes dark and the Dementors are on the train. Harry's flight over Hogwarts and Loch Shiel on Buckbeak is spectacular. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot and the pace never flags. This film has definitely set the pattern for the rest of the series. A really good one."
546,10,Getting Darker,"If you are a Harry Potter fan without the benefit of reading the books, then I am sure you really enjoyed this latest movie, and perhaps thought it was the best of the trio so far. Most of the fans of the books have said the same thing to me, they were a little disappointed at how much was left out."
547,9,A good movie  but it leaves out so much of the book!,This movie is the best out of all 8! The character development is amazing and you can see how the characters developed from years 1&2 and the plot twist gave me a huge shock. I definitely recommend that you watch! The visuals were just beautiful and the relationship between Harry and Sirius was so powerful.
548,10,Best Of The Sequels,"It's a peculiar thing. The ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was written by the same author ... adapted by the same screenwriter ... played by the same cast ... so why the hell is it so much better than the previous two? The answer, of course, lies in the change of director. Mr Columbus, I don't want to hurt your feelings but ... you suck. The arrival of foreign director Alfonso Cuarón has saved the franchise for me, just when I was about ready to give up on the whole series of films. The problem was that I could see the potential of the books, which had thus far not been realised on film. They just had no magic about them at all. But this latest offering from Hogwarts has plenty of that magic to spare."
549,6,The best one yet!,"It seems that once again, I am one of the few to criticise Harry Potter films (3/10 for Goblet of Fire). What spoilt this film largely for me was the special effects. The Dementors were a huge disappointment - they looked like men with pieces of black cloth over their heads. As with the Goblet of Fire, not enough time was spent on small but important details. Harry does not meet Cho in this movie, which provokes an unlikely glance at a random Ravenclaw in the fourth movie as Harry's basis for falling in love. Where was the quidditch? Where was Diggory?"
550,6,Poor special effects spoilt the movie,"As Harry Potter returns for another year at Hogwart's, sinister shadows from his past seem to be catching up with him."
551,8,dark family history - with monsters,"If you ask me, ""Prisoner of Azakaban"", directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien), is the weakest Harry Potter film so far."
552,,Twice told tale,"Literally perfect movie that I can keep coming back to over and over, no matter how many times I watch I will cry at the scene over the lake as Harry sames himself from the deatheaters."
553,10,Best Harry Potter movie,"Potter film #3 starts to get a bit dark. The plot isn't as riveting, the kids aren't as ""cute"", and the special effects start to get too ""digital"". And the magic isn't as plausible."
554,6,Not as strong as the first two installments,HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN 
555,8,"PRISONER OF AZKABAN : Stylistically Superior, Though The Storyline Underwhelms","For the first time a film adaptation of one of the series of wildly popular Harry Potter books is presented with the most unaccustomed challenges, ones the previous two ventures had not met up with. First, Chris Columbus, who had directed both the Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets, has moved into the producer's chair in order to give Alfonso Cuaron, director of Y Tu Mama Tambien, a chance to take a stab at the fantasy series. Secondly, though the previous feature films had enjoyed fruitful success at the box office during the Thanksgiving holiday, the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first film in the series to open during the summer. Perhaps WB is trying to prove Harry Potter can have just as much success at changing venues as Pixar did last summer with Finding Nemo? Maybe  The most notable change for the series of film adaptations is the particular demographic it is attempting to play to. Though the first film was aimed mainly at the tweener and teenage crowds, the third movie will shift swiftly by aiming for a more mature audience, namely teens and young adults. Will too many changes all at once be too much for this film to handle? There is no doubt its opening weekend will bring in big numbers, so its final evaluation will depend mainly on the reaction of movie-goers and, of most concern to WB executives, the fans."
556,9,The Moose Hole - Review of Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,Okay first off I am a Harry Potter fan but first and foremost I am a movie fan. This said I gave what I believe was a fair grade. Let's start off as why this movie got a 2.
557,2,Another Lousy Adaptation,Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban is the best Harry Potter movie and the scariest as well. It was nice to hear that it won 9 awards (more than Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets as it was better).
558,9,The best Harry Potter movie.,"I thought this film was very well made. You can see how mature Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe are becoming. Also, I think they made a brilliant choice of casting Dawn French to play the fat lady. She was a brilliant comedy relief to what is otherwise an extremely dark film. Although I loved this film, I have a few criticisms to point out, namely about the book content vs film content."
559,,Not as good as the others.,"I love it! It has humour,action,drama and all. Honestly, it deserves more attention. I recommand you it."
560,10,My favorite Harry Potter movie,"I have yet to read one of the Harry Potter' books and maybe it's high time I did  because, based upon the movies made from them, I have a hard time seeing exactly why they're so popular."
561,,There's got to be SOME reason why these stories are so popular . . .,"The third installment in the Harry Potter series, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" is a step up from the previous two films in many ways. The plot is more complex, the acting is stronger, and the visuals are even more stunning."
562,8,"A Darker, More Complex Adventure That Casts a Spell Despite Some Flaws","J.K. Rowling has creating an amazing universe that Harry Potter and his friends occupy, and I'm fascinated at the way each movie has allowed Harry to grow and mature from childhood to now early teenage years.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all are outstanding as the leads, with Alan Rickman and David Thewlis providing solid support.  The special effects are once again spectacular, and I feel that CGI has never been put to better use than it has in the Potter series.  I found myself missing Richard Harris, however.  His world-weary hoarseness gave Dumbledore a type of regalness not achieved by replacement Michael Gambon.  That aside, the growth given to the characters whets your appetite for more in the series, and I'm already anxious for the next one."
563,,Long live the Potter series,A little disappointing after some of the really good reviews this film got. I saw it a week after Shrek 2 and it pales in comparison. The three main characters are a little older and instead of being impressive child actors they seem little more than average. By the next sequel the two boys will have trouble playing their characters ages. It really had the feel of a Walt Disney TV movie. Kind of a jazzed up Bednobs and Broomsticks. Still the demographic it is aimed at is 13 year olds and it should continue to impress that age group. I would still recommend it for 16 year olds and under but DO NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE! It is not as good as the first film and you will probably be disappointed if you go in expecting that.
564,6,More of the same,"This movie is as entertaining as any other Harry Potter flick, but I feel the story was a little too convoluted. Lots of new characters suddenly introduced with their backstories explained in seconds, overlayed on top of other unrelated plots happening at the same time, it's all a bit much. I did really like the sections closer to the end though, they were nicely done."
565,7,"Entertaining and creative film, but a bit hard to follow","I had the pleasure of watching ""POA"" in an IMAX theater.  It made the scenes such as Harry riding the hippogriff breathtaking."
566,10,Hail Hermione,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But the director had a monumental challenge in adapting a book that most fans have read dozens of times and memorized down to the tiniest detail. Of course, even the slightest deviation from the book was going to be met with aghast cries from the Potter-obsessed. So instead of trying to cram everything into the movie, Cuaron went for style instead and tried to transplant his own vision, instead of Rowlings's, to the screen."
567,7,Good as a film but missing some crucial details,"""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is easily my favourite of the three Harry Potter films so far. The real magic of this film is that, simply put, it is the first in the series to really make optimal use of the medium of film to look at some different aspects of the world of Harry Potter."
568,10,Magical,"If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet."
569,5,Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Daniel Raddcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Tom Felton, Oliver Phelps, James Phelps."
570,,They are all getting older as they play these parts.,"So far, I think I have to say that this episode of the Harry Potter series is my favourite. Radcliffe has obviously gained more experience in acting and it shows on the screen. A lot of Rowling's imaginative material has been portrayed excellently on the screen, for the film is visually striking. This is a very tightly made film and everything makes sense, even at points where you think it might falter."
571,,Potter grows up,I must say I expect a lot from the third installment of the Harry Potter franchise. One thing that concerned me before I went that critics who gave HP1 and HP2 low ratings were now giving HP3 raving reviews.
572,6,Harry Potter and The Prisoner of ME!,I really like this film. But something isn't right with marauders map and peter pettigrew. Ron's brothers if they had the marauders map why they didn't saw that peter pettigrew was with Ron? Something JK Rawlings made mistake. She should think about it that. Other than that this film is one of my favourite. But after the 4th film I think loose it's magic. The last film is also one of my favourites. But 5 and 6 not so good my opinion. Hope they make a sequel like Harry Potters son and his adventures.
573,10,The best film!,"Unlike the first and the second season this one was little bit darker, this one was complete the story and plot are perfect and the twists are amazing and unpredictable, They balanced between Sarcasm and seriousness , the end was emotional and I felt it so much. I think this is The wind before the storm."
574,8,great movie,"First off, it was definitely not as creepy as the trailer made it seem. And secondly, I was a bit disappointed that the whole moral of this book seemed to have been lost in the writing of the script. What happened to Hagrid's talk to Harry and Ron about friends being more important than broomsticks or rats? "
575,9,"A bit disappointing *spoilers, in a way*","Year 3. Harry Finds himself playing host to his Uncle sister. They clearly get along , like oil and water , snake and mongoose. This get better when Vernons sister insults Harry's dead parents. Thing are quickly blown out of proportion and Harry gets his opinions off his chest."
576,2,Turn away,"This is a good movie that Potter fans will enjoy but it is not up to the level of the previous two. Less time is spent with the adults and there is considerably less magic by everyone except Harry. Richard Harris' replacement seems lost in his role; is he wise or lost in the school? The answer isn't clear and I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the time seeking the answer. The plot line is razor thin and the climax is a mere bump in the storyline. Lots of surprises as to why the second week ticket sales drops so sharply. Funny thing was is that I wasn't surprised as all. One can only hope this movie is a segway to something greater else this series has run its course. One last note, you can tell how much everyone has grown up since the last movie. Unfortunately, many of the classmates are not present in the background. Mr. Longshaft was good in the first two movies but is both absent and not even mentioned in the third."
577,7,Missing key elements,"This third installment in the Harry Potter series sports a new style, much different from the previous two films' style. It turns the family-friendly franchise into a new, teenager-friendly offering, complete with teen angst, anger, and puppy love. The films are growing with their audience."
578,10,A new style for a great series.,"I consider myself quite a Potter-maniac. I have seen each of the films based on the novels over and over again and I consider this adaptation of 'Prisoner of Azkaban' to be THE Best! Everything about this film just brings the world of Harry Potter to life more vividly, more convincingly and more movingly - from the Knight Bus, the Dementors, the Marauder's Map, Shrieking Shack, Buckbeak, the Hippogriff and of course, the eponymous Prisoner of Azkaban Sirius Black, is brought to life so well that it's an unforgettable experience! Of course, I do personally think that 'Azkaban' as a novel itself is leaps and bounds better than the previous two novels Rowling wrote. Compared to 'Sorcerer's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets', 'Azkaban' inherently is so fast-paced, action-packed and thrilling that a movie based on it HAD to be good! How could it not?! And yet, this film exceeds expectations... Even the soundtrack for 'Azkaban' is way better and plentiful than in the previous 2 films. The Harry Potter theme given by John Williams, the theme with which this film opens, is one of my most favorite movie themes. I cannot praise John Williams enough for composing that theme... The moment you hear it, you're just transported to that magical world of Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Hagrid and co! I don't think anyone could've composed a better theme to encapsulate the sheer magic of Harry Potter! "
579,10,Superbus Totalus! THE Best adaptation of a Harry Potter book!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a terrific book, but Alfonso Cuaron's direction of the movie was absolutely terrible! There was no Harry Potter feel to it at all! Everything good from the first two movies was ruined in this ridicules excuse for a Harry Potter film! The lighting, the acting, and the sequences were all wrong. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm all for expressing liberties, but for a series like Harry Potter, the movie should follow the book as much as possible because the books are just so great! Chris Columbus did such a terrific job directing the first two movies, and I don't know why he resigned, but he needs to come back and direct the fourth one, or else, this series may very well be doomed..."
580,1,One of the worst movies ever made!,"This isn't my favourite Potter movie, but Sirius Black's character is so great and the central mystery is very strong. A good detective film."
581,8,The one that everyone likes,I am a Harry Potter book fan. And I also loved the first two movies. But the problem with the first two movies was that it was too detailed. I don't mind scriptwriters butchering a novel just as long as its justified. And this Harry Potter is a perfect example.
582,9,"finally, a Harry Potter film with sense!","Despite what you may have heard, Prisoner of Azkaban is very much like the other two Harry Potter movies.  I think it's a safe bet that people who liked the first two will like this one.  On the other hand, if you didn't like one or both of the others, this one has the same flaws.  Prisoner of Azkaban is a little more dark and scary, and the three kids act more like teens.  But it's really the same basic story line.  Harry can't get along with his aunt and uncle.  He performs a few magic tricks.  In short order, he returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with friends, Ron and Hermione.  At the school, the three friends attend various classes in magic and are harassed by Malfoy.  After a game or two of Quiddich, Harry encounters some supernatural menace, which by the end of the movie, he is able to overcome.  The Potter movies, like the books on which they are based, seem to appeal more to children and their mothers than to other demographics.  They don't have the universal appeal of classic children's movies like The Wizard of Oz and E T, the Extraterrestrial.  Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) get to do more acting this time around (especially Watson), but unfortunately, neither is up to the task.  They are caught in that awkward in-between stage that many child actors go through. They are too old to just act cute but haven't yet learned the craft of acting.  They both fare no better than the typical teen actor on the Disney Channel."
583,,Same old story,"As I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie, I wondered, what in the world were the makers thinking?? A colossal amount of money wasted for this???? There is not even an attempt to explain the story to the viewers, its just thrown in their faces. I stil dont know what to think of the silly dementors, and the main story involving Potter's family's murder."
584,2,looked like a spy kids movie,"This latest book conversion in the series lives up to expectations. While the other characters retain a sense of whit and live up to what you would expect, harry reveals more to both sides of himself - his flaws as a child and depth as a growing person. That aside, this movie works quite well independantly - I saw it with 2 people who had no interest in seeing the previous movies and they admired the films other good points: Nice special effects & constant plot twists. A lot of plot detail exists here to attempt to make us think but for me, this is where the movie flounders as an offering for adults as the more intelligent and critical of us will predict crutial plot points quite easily and lead to self awareness, Saying that - the plot points retain their emotion and fight off boredom. Child Acting, Plot (too fast to retain depth, restrained to one location), One very lord of the rings comparable creature & obvious CGI in moments sum up my gripes. The score is top notch and the OST worth an independant listen (- John Williams usual amazing standard)."
585,,Not a bad offering,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban went on general release in the UK yesterday and I caught a late-night showing. 
586,8,A more adult Harry Potter movie.,"If Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the true coming of age story for both Harry and for the series in general, then Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the spiritual coming of age for the series; something which the film adaptation emphasizes subtly but brilliantly. The story itself is a departure from the previous two books; both Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were all Harry and his friends exploring all the wonders of the wizarding world, specifically Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. True, there WERE villains to fight and challenges to overcome and danger, but basically, for all intents and purposes, the first two books are very well-written and elaborate children's fantasy books. Prisoner of Azkaban is different; there is a constant atmosphere of depression, of darkness and evil lingering in the air. Harry is no longer a small innocent child opened up to a world of wonder; he is instead a young teenager filled with emotion, at one point prepared to kill a man he is convinced was responsible for his parents death. Such fantastic elements and trappings as a flying car, a three-headed dog or a giant chessboard are traded in for werewolves and Dementors, the latter personifying the atmosphere of evil and darkness lurking over Hogwarts and over Harry in particular. If the book is a departure from its predecessors, the film is doubly so, for it deviates from the two previous Potter films directed by Columbus both in plot as well as in overall direction (not surprising since we have a new director at the helm, Alfonso Curaro). There is a marked stylistic difference from the previous films-Hogwarts is no longer a wonderland of magic and fantasy, it is a dark ancient castle bubbling with mysterious and invisible forces, some of them evil...danger may well lurk in its every shadow! This transformation is not just something you see, you feel it, quite literally! Add on to this the fact that Harry is the prime target of an escaped convict believed to be a vicious mass murderer, and that he is dogged by omens of death (the Grimm) everywhere he goes, not to mention being particularly susceptible to the despair spread by the Dementors and you get the idea of the atmosphere that is being skillfully and subtly crafted here. And yet, as Dumbledore rightly says early on in the film, 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of places'. For it is in this films that Harry first truly finds a mentor (he and Dumbledore have barely shared any screen time at this point); in Remus Lupin, his new Defence Against the Dark teacher, who teaches him to combat his despair both literally by teaching him a spell to repel the Dementors, and figuratively by offering him moral support throughout the film. One of the few shortcomings about this film was that a lot of the expository dialogs from the book were left out, presumably to maintain a fast pace, in stark contrast to the previous films which were almost word to word adaptations in most regards; while these omissions do not ordinarily detract from the story in any way, die-hard fans may find their absence disquieting The performances are spot on, as expected in any Potter film, though Lupin comes across as being more confident and assertive than in the book (a small liberty) and Draco Malfoy seems reduced almost to comic relief. But overall, my review is an appreciation of the film as a whole. This is definitely the best film in the series too date...it clearly surpasses its otherwise excellent predecessors, and none of its successors have succeeded in coming close to matching it; though Half-Blood Prince may well be the one that beats it when it releases later this week."
587,10,The best of the series so far...truly an 'atmospheric' film...,"This will be short since everyone here pretty much has already said what I think also. The plot does not quite emphasize and skips over most of what the 3rd book was about.. I completely agree that Dumbledore did not possess that unique quality that made you fear nothing in his presence. He didn't make you feel AT ALL that he was the greatest wizard. They just skipped too many things. One thing I haven't heard too often was their trip to Hogsmeade... The person I went with never read the book and had no idea what Hogsmeade was, how important it was to the students, and why harry always had the cloak on him while he was there... I had to just about explain everything to her at the end.. If this director made all the HP movies, I would simply HAVE to read the book just to know what was going on.... It was a good visual, but the story lacks much desired by the fans, and by people just wanting to know why certain things were going on...."
588,6,"not a bad flick, but not so true to the storyline...","This movie would be too dark for a child less than 8 years old but too childish for anyone over 12. The effects were horrible, the plot line disjointed, and the screenplay a far cry from the book. I a 24 year old, avid reader and huge fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies. Now I understand that it is a large book and it is impossible to literally translate a book to the screen but Chris Columbus did a great job with the first two films."
589,3,A Horrible Disappointment!,"Harry Potter 3 is the best of the series as it, like the book before it, takes on a much more darker tone as Harry finds himself the target of one of Voldemort's loyal supporters, the evil Sirius Black."
590,9,The Best of a Great Series,"I've refrained from reviewing this movie for awhile now, but I an finally going to put my two cents in. This may be rather long, but I have a lot to say. I watched this film the first time and absolutely despised it, along with the 3 other people watching it with me. I decided to have another go at it now that my expectations of the movie were blown to smithereens, never to be repaired. The second time, I enjoyed it a little more, but I realized that I was watching the film now as if it was any other film, that didn't have predecessors and could stand alone. This, in and of itself, disturbed me, since the HP movies are meant to flow together and seem like each other. This isn't just any other movie, this was the third part of a many movie installment. "
591,3,Lacking substance and so much more (spoilers),"I am getting pretty tired of the peeps going on and on about how dark this movie is.  Come on Peeps, It is not that dark.  Witch craft.  Mysticism. The undead.  Aren't these supposed to be dark subjects?  School by itself can be a very dark subject.  This was a very light movie and is suitable for all but the most dangerously sheltered individuals."
592,7,"The best so far, by far.","For the first time I was actually entertained watching a Harry Potter film rather than just impressed.  The first two films in the series were certainly watchable but fatally flawed by their slavish devotion to the books on which they were based.  By trying to exactly replicate the novels, rather than be allowed to exist as movies, the first 2 were suffocated - not allowed to 'breath' as it were - and ended up coming across as merely mechanical exercises rather than entertainment in their own right."
593,8,Easily the best one yet,"I was very disappointed with this film. I felt like I was being rushed though the whole movie, and too many crucial parts were left out. The total movie time was approx 2 hours and 12 minutes! I didn't like this new director's interpretation of the book. Everything was changed. I didn't feel any magic (no pun intended), and it seemed as if the movie was filmed in black & white. The golden glow was gone. The teachers only had a cameo, and I didn't feel Dumbledore's presence...not to mention that his beautiful white-silver beard and hair was turned into a muddy grey. Quidditch seemed to be non-existent, and the pitch was stripped of the flowing school banners. I hope the Dementors get Cuaron so he will not mess up any more HP movies. How could Ms. Rowling let him destroy her book?"
594,5,Very Disappointed :-(,I'll never get the 'Harry Potter' craze! I read the first book and thought it was rubbish! I thought it lacked originality in to many places to be considered a 'masterpiece' but I know very little about literature so my argument is limited!
595,4,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"FIRST, this is a wonderful film and well-acted; the little kids of the first films were wonderful actors then and even better now.  The time flew by and I didn't feel I'd been there but a little bit because the story flows so well."
596,10,"a""10"" but with reservations.","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first Harry Potter movie that isn't just an adaptation, it's also a good movie on its own. Not that the first two were bad, but they felt more like adaptations than they do films. Why is this one better? Let's take a look, shall we?"
597,10,The First Harry Potter Movie that isn't Just an Adaptation,"In this prisoner of Azkaban, I like lupin, Sirius and Porter's friendship."
598,10,To Sirius,"From the 3rd Movie onwards Harry Potter stops being a children's movie and becomes a dark adults fantasy series, and this movie has a sense of seriousness that the other movies lacked, with a better execution on cinematography and acting."
599,6,Darkened Story Line,"I disliked this movie enough to write a review on it. I want to start out by saying I have been an unsuspecting fan of the Harry Potter Books. I picked one up as a test, and couldn't put any of them down since."
600,,How Could They Allow This Terrible Potter Sequel?,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2004."
601,9,Magicians not to be messed with,"I gotta say, this movie is good, but not that good. I liked 1 & 2 both movies as well as books. But, here I prefer the book. There seems to be some plot holes. Like when Peter was discovered, they didn't go much deeper like Rowling did in the book. They made some modifications, but I didn't mind them that much. I feel bad Richard Harris died as he was perfect for the role of Dumbledore. Special effects are good. The whooping Willow's location in this movie is different that of the second movie, I guess. There is no final talk between Dumbledore and Harry where Dumbledore explains about Peter Pettigrew's bond and more into the love of Harry's parent's."
602,6,Mischief Managed!,"While Chris Columbus did do his job making worthy adaptations of the first two Potter films and had the loyalty of fans of the book (myself included) they lacked much, entertainment being one of the biggest, as they felt more like a vision with people talking from the book rather than an actual movie. But the Harry Potter series has now met Alfonso Cauron, who proves to not only manage to give the Harry Potter series some much needed spunk and maturity, but also proves to make it a good movie on its own merits."
603,8,"A Darker, More Mature Potter","The movie represents about 25% of the book. Much of it seems to presume that you have read the book. It is a sometimes choppy set of vignettes that barely cover the plot and provides the reader with some visual references for the book. The effects are gorgeous and I was pleasantly surprised by David Thewlis and Gary Oldman who brought Lupin and Black to life. I was also please by the Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, he brought a new strength the for the future."
604,5,"Pretty, but disappointing","Harry finds out a maniac has escaped the wizard prison Azkaban, bent on killing him."
605,8,the first good Harry Potter film,"Goof? In Prof. Lupin's class, after Lupin turns the make believe Dementor into a full moon, the scar on Harry's forehead appears on the left side of his forehead, instead of the right side. I question this mistake because it not only is all too obvious, it is also a mistake that is hard to believe it was made! This film stands with all the others and being top drawer, and will remain a classic for all of those living in centuries to come, provided there are centuries to come! 2015? I fear that I shall live long enough to witness the end of life as we know it to be."
606,10,Terrific and Tantalizing,"Harry Potter 3 is really a good time at the movies, but just not as great as reading the book. Saying that, I did love the special effects, and the Dementors were just as I pictured in my imagination. The Griffin was REALLY well done but the flying scenes on him were a little 'The Neverending Story' for me and lasted too long. There has been talk that this movie is ""darker"" and that it may be too scary for kids, but I don't really find that is the case. None of the little kids in my theatre seemed to be upset over the scenes, and there really isn't ""jump-at-you"" moments that would make small children cry. Even Snape, one of my favorite characters, isn't that scary at all in this installment. There is plenty of silliness to appeal to kids, and I think they would love all the creatures and characters just as much as in the book. It is weird to see all the actors growing up though, with deeper voices and teenage bodies (complete with acne!) and that made a lot of people chatter at the beginning of the movie (""Listen to his voice!""""Ron looks so grown up""). Something though was just missing for me. I just feel like I didn't totally feel the magic like I had in the very first HP movie. I would say see it, but please read the book too - it is so much more rich, vibrant, and magical than the movie."
607,7,Not as fun as reading the book,"This is a movie which demonstrates big-budget special effects franchises can be about something more. Adolescent longing and the feeling of being trapped and misunderstood pervade this story. Although a tad too long, this might well be the richest of all Potter movies in terms of themes and characters."
608,9,The most intimate Potter,"This was a fun film, well told. The change to a darker, more adult theme is set up from the start with grainy film and hand-held camera work (two Columbus no-nos). It is interesting to compare it to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The themes of growing up, leaving one's parents, the inevitability of fate, the possibility of glimpsing the future... it's all in the two of them. Some of the visual stuff is great: the train icing up when the Dementers appear for example. BUT, but - as so many have said, and I have to enter my ha'penneth - this cuts too much from the book. There needs to be more dialogue - difficult when the director obviously was trying to keep something visual and pacy. But so much was left out that is intrinsic to the wonder of the book, which is so moving and wise (yes, really!) The connections between Pettigrew (Wormtail), Lupin (Mooney), Black (Padfoot), and James Potter (Prongs) are not touched on in the film AT ALL. And Dumbledore's final conversation with Harry, when he says it is our choices as much as our abilities that determine who we are. I know that a film can't be a book, but sometimes, just sometimes, you can do something even better. This falls between two stools - too faithful to be a complete re-imagining, too faithless to fully convey the reason why the books are so successful. Timothy Spall was a good rat though!"
609,6,Close...but no cigar (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),"I watched it many times,its so good,the dark story,the time travel complicated story,all is good"
610,8,I love it,"""Tragically underused"" is the first term that seems to come to mind for the Harry Potter films.  All three tragically underuse the charismatic and talented Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, the second and third tragically underuse Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, the second tragically underuses Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, and the third tragically underuses Emma Thompson as Sybil Trelawney.  They have still risen above these mistakes."
611,8,"""Tragically underused"" is becoming their mantra.","I saw this movie and I still feel the same way about this one.  It's just way too ""Disney"" for me.  That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the film, it just means I liked it as much as the other ones.  The kids are doing a great job as usual.  I also really enjoyed the actor they chose to play Dumbledore, even though he really didn't sound like him.  However, I still liked the way Richard Harris played him best.  I hope they decide to keep the same cast for the rest of the movies, but, if they do change certain actors, I understand that too.  I recommend this film for those who have already seen the rest.  I am looking forward to the next one coming out next year.  I give this one a 5 out of 10."
612,,Okay...,Now I have watched this movie so many times and I have grew up with harry potter like most of you here have and I was disappointed with this movie. It was a good movie but also bad at the same time. Let me explain
613,7,"Good, but still the weakest of the franchise","J.K. Rowling showed the world the boy wizard on paper, a place where he could be whatever we wanted him to be. Now that he is on the silver screen, the audience is given a wonderful view of how one person sees the magical world of Hogwarts. However, for some people, if a director strays from the source material even a hair, the movie is immediately deemed a failure. What these people (fondly known as 'potheads') don't understand is that the books they love are many hours in length and the movies have a time crunch of 21/2 hours. And the movies are also based on the books. "
614,8,Better Than the First Two!!,"I love this movie. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed with a few things, but you can't always match your vision with the vision of the director. All of the Harry Potter main characters, played by Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint, were much better this time around (I still like to laugh at their acting jobs in the first two movies, but they were kids). The replacement Dumbledore I actually liked BETTER than the first one because he seemed more quirky, more like the Dumbledore that I picture and that is represented in the books. David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were fine, though I see them differently as well. Not that he is ugly, but Sirius Black is supposed to be very, VERY good-looking, and you could not see a trace of a good-looking man (that I pictured) in the withered Oldman."
615,9,Wonderful. Best one yet.,"I was very excited about this movies. I love the 3rd book of the series and the saga in general, I love the first two movies and so I was very eager to watch this movie. I expected from it to be great. But it was even better than expected. The new director, Alfonso Quaron created a new cool vision of the movie and the result was fascinating - the 3rd movie about Harry Potter looks even better than it's predecessors! Also the kids are playing their characters better and better, Daniel Radcliffe won my sincerest admiration as Harry Potter. The special effects are spectacular, especially the Dementors, which are, in my opinion, one of the coolest monsters in cinema. The film was also very touching, I almost cried in some parts and I'm quite old for this sort of things - 20 years. The movie was much quicker than the previous installments as action, but still, it tells the story from the book very well. I think that the part with"
616,10,the best of them so far.,"Prizoner of Azkaban is definitely one of my favorites out of the seven Harry Potter novels, although perhaps not my favorite. However, I can say without reservation that until the next two films come out and I can pass judgment on them, this is my favorite of the film series. Cuaron's genius at direction and writing is easily tangible in this instant classic."
617,9,Brilliantly done,I enjoyed the film because seeing the young actors and actresses is great fun and the movie was scarry as it should have been.  
618,9,Good scarry film but Cuaron changed way to much.,This is my ultimate favourite book of the Harry Potter series. Its a turning point in Harry's point and it contains two of the best new characters of the HP world: Sirius and Remus. These two characters are portrayed brilliantly by Gary Oldman and David Thewlis respectively.
619,10,Good..... but it has nothing on the book.....,"I thought the movie was spectacular.  I love how the director make it dark to sort of match the theme of this part of the series.  On that note of the director I would like to point of other than the way he shot the movie, I thought he sucked a a director.  For one I hated how he opted to have the movie short, and in the finished product he didn't put  little parts of the story in the correct sequence from the book, making it obvious.  I for one I wonder if the guy read the book and second cared if he was getting it right. I did love the movie but the way it was put together in some areas and especially the ending sucked.  Adding 10 to 15 more minutes would have done the movie a lot more good than harm.  What also bugged me were the fade ins and outs wit the hole circle to cut to another scene.  It worked for one part of the movie but then the others were just thrown in.  I am glad this guys is not directing the fourth film.  But  I thought the movie overall not looking at those aspects was brilliant.  I thought the character have improved a lot and found it nice to be more grown up, though I do still wish they would shoot back to back.  But I hope they keep one with the films so the main characters never become new actors.  These films kick butt!!!!!!"
620,10,Awesome movie...maybe better the the first 2.,"Whatever was Warner Bros. Pictures thinking when they decided that Alfonso Cuarón should direct this film? First of all his well known film is Y tu mamá también, which was good with critics, but not really Harry Potter worthy if you ask me."
621,7,I Wish I Had Been in Azkaban Than Watching This Film :-(,"Frankly I don't know where to begin with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Having not entirely been enamoured by the previous two films both of which were far too long to sustain their storyline and didn't have enough humanity to make the viewer care what happened to anyone I went in with a certain foreboding. My main, if not only reason for turning up this time was the knowledge that Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the beautiful Great Expectations and thrilling Y Tu Mama Tambian was behind the camera -- I wanted to see if someone with his talent would be submerged within the needs of this kind of franchise. I needn't have worried."
622,,Bloody brilliant,"What a disappointment. The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best written, most intriguing story of all the Harry Potter books. It has a great plot with many twists. It is the story and the actors that carry this movie. The cinematography and effects can not compare to the first two movies. The colors are dull and the film has a look and feel of a movie that is 20 years old and has faded or has not kept up with the technology of the times. The new Hogwarts looks old and run down and the colorful, magical feel is completely gone. Most scenes seem washed out as if you were watching an old TV set that had very poor color. The actors are superb and Harry has lost that awkward pre teen look. He has matured and has a confidence that accurately reflects his growth in the book. With the great story and incredible actors, this could have been an all time classic. However with the poor job the new director did and the direction they took with the look of the movie,the Prisoner of Azkaban just okay. ""Just okay"" for such a great story and incredible actors should be considered a failure."
623,1,"Harry Potter 3, The Magic is Gone","If you were impressed by the first two parts in this franchise, prepare to kill yourself as the director change makes the flow drop dead. Looking at the credentials of the guy who directed this movie, its no surprise. The acting by the newly introduced characters is absolutely horrible and even the old ones seem to have lost their touch. The plot takes many inexplicable and highly illogical twists and turns. With utterly crappy CGI and special effects, especially during the werewolf scene, this movie is actually a downgrade. The deatheaters were however, very nicely done. As a movie by itself, this is really not that bad and can be entertaining but has seriously gone downhill after the first two parts."
624,,Mostly terrible,**Spoiler**
625,,like eating McDonalds food . . . .,This film is by far the best HP movie!
626,10,best film ever,"Harry Potter is a sequence of stories beginning with Harry as a child, and then growing up.  Nevertheless, it is a kids story, and this film lacks that kid element - unless we have demented kids running around."
627,6,Not wild about Harry,Onward and upward! 
628,1,Great if you haven't read the book - virtually unrecognizable if you have.,"It's year three at Hogwarts for Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Some may wonder how the trio has grown so much since the last movie. It's simple. While Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban are only one year apart in the story, the movies were filmed two years apart. In storyline the three kids are 13 years old."
629,8,Decent third installment,"In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry becomes trapped in a much darker wizarding world where Harry is hunted after by an fearsome serial killer named Sirius Black, who sold his parents to Voldemort. Harry has a story that isn't as worried about the evil wizards, but more about past that is delved into even deeper because of Professor Lupin, the new DADA teacher, who is a brilliantly cast by David Thewlis. Gary Oldman is great as the dark on the outside, secretly good guy Sirius Black. Again, the trio's acting progresses. I think that this is the best movie in the series. Alfonso Cuaron's directing was pretty good, and change was only expected when they didn't do it in 2003, one year after the previous film like the first two. Change is good, and I think that this series is progressing constantly."
630,10,Everything Has Changed,"Takes a while for this to kick off, however it begins to improve in the middle. The issue is the last half an hour takes too long and becomes quite tiresome, but before that it is great."
631,8,Excellent but a bit too slow,"It's the third Harry Potter film and things are changing. Alfonso Cuarón has taken over directing, and as the characters get more mature, so too do the themes."
632,9,Fantastic Installment of Harry Potter,"This movie impressed me very much. After I saw the second movie I worried that the third story (that incidentally is my Fav. of the series) would be inferior to the first two because of a new director taking the helm, new actors in new roles etc. "
633,,Something brilliant this ways come!,"This film was excellent. Absolutely fantastic. The style made you realise immediately that the movie was in the hands of another director. (Nothing against Chris Columbus... I loved the first two movies as well). It was definitely darker and scarier than the previous ones and the acting and effects were superb. The kids have really grown into mature actors and now that they have a bit more practice and experience, they looked and performed great. I haven't read the books, but I loved the story. Emma Thompson did a good job but I feel she was wasted. The movie could have done without those scenes... A very enjoyable experience... awesome film. *****/*****"
634,10,Brilliant,"I went to see this film expecting something along the lines of the first two films, and was surprised to find that this film was very different. Chunks of the story are missed out so the film isn't so attentative to detail as the Chris Columbus ones were. Also, this film is much more ""artistic"", if you want to put it that way; the seasons are represented colorfully and that sort of thing. But this isn't a bad thing, on the contrary, this film is pretty entertaining with the adult actors doing a good job, but the kids seriously getting on your nerves. Look out for Lenny Henry as the shrunken head on the Knight bus (""It's gonna be a bumpy ride""). Decidedly worth seeing. Enjoy it! 8/10"
635,8,Lamentably better than the first two,"I must say, I am not a big fan of the HARRY POTTER saga, but I must say there y are good books, specially for kids about 10. Cuarón is a great director, and I thought he could improve the movie (compared to the previous films). Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban is definitely different compared to the previous films. In positive factors, this film performances are better (but still can satisfy my expectations), the scenery is better, but Cuaron's desire to change everything and brake Rollwin's traditional books is quite daring. Harry Potter and the sorceress's stone and Harry potter and the chamber of secrets are literal adaptations of the books (which are quite bad, boring and lame) some of the plot in the film is shattered by Cuaron's idea to do some changes. The 3 main actors look to old to be playing 13-year-old teens (Except Hermione). Gary Oldman's performance was insufficient and lame. The visual effects are quite bad compared to other features such as the Lord of the Rings and The perfect Storm. The costumes are not loyal to the book, and in my opinion, the changes of setting was very good. I was glad to find some references to Mexico. When at Hogsmade, Harry enters the sweet shop, you can see some colourful and attractive sugar `calacas' skeletons (Which are traditionally used in Mexico at Dia de Muertos, Mexican celebration of Halloween). I am definitely not watching the fourth one. 5.32/10.00"
636,1,Oh my GOD ¿?!!!!!,Mysterious; Lore Building; Dramatic; Wizardly; Stable time loops are pretty rad
637,8,"Stanley Shunpike Stans ONLY (🖥, 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧, 💭, 📆)","My overwhelming reaction to the movie was, ""Is the movie over yet???"""
638,1,"All fluff and no substance, so don't expect too much.","I really enjoyed watching the first 2 Pothead movies, so I got used to some stuff from the book to be left out. But this movie left out too much. What they should do is put out 2 parts of this movie, and make you see the first part first. That would work perfectly. Overall, a good movie!"
639,8,Director Curion is breathtaking,"Although this movie leaves out some important details from the book, it has something most of the movies don't. The magic And the tone of the book are truly here. And the parts they did have from the book where outstanding.<br /><br />The first two where good and faithful too the most, but didn't have that magical feel for me.."
640,10,This is the best harry potter adaptation!,"This movie was much less faithful to the book than the earlier movies.  Many details were left out and others were changed.  The changes were well done, though, as they made the movie flow smoothly and be much more dramatic.  On the whole, this was the best of the three."
641,,Excellent,"Chamber of Secrets and Philosopher Stone has been done back to back. After the amazing work Chris Columbus did for the Potter movies he was Physically and emotionally exhausted, there was no way he could do another Harry Potter film. Beside this fact I think the Potter universe also needed some changes. Because in the books from book 3 it is going to change something. We get some darker themes and I think it was the right thing to bring on a new director. 1 and 2 were true childish films and you could see that on the look of the film. Hogwarts is going to be darker. So the third one needed a new Director. The choice that Chris remained on in the crew to guide the new film crew onto the Post Chris era was really good."
642,8,Alfonso is the right man,(Spoilers)
643,,Not as good as hoped.,The 3rd instalment in J.K Rowlings multi-billion pound franchise is widely regarded as the best and most confusing of the entire series for people who haven't read the books thus far.
644,8,Truly Magical!,"I went to see the first show today at 10:00 with 3 friends and my sister. During the credits it says ""Based on the novel by J.K Rowling."" That is dead wrong. It should say ""Loosely based on the novel by J.K Rowling."" The movie left out about 80 of the most important pages from the book and replaced it with things like the Hogwarts chorus and prolonged Knight Bus and hippogriff scenes. The various parts of the plot don't line up and the casting was awful. David Thewlis looked nothing like J.K Rowling's descriptions of Lupin. The whole movie is completely messed up. When I rated this movie, on a scale of 1 to 10, I gave it a 5. One word sums it all up: dissatisfied. All my friends agree."
645,5,"""Loosely"" Based","After having seen the first 2 Harry Potter films, I thought I might have seen enough.  In fact, I said I would retire from the series after this film, but after watching it, I can't wait too see what happens next!  Ok, so basically we are taken on another journey to experience yet another year at Hogwarts School for Wizards.  As usual, something is up.  It seems Sirius Black, a wanted murderer has escaped from Azkaban Prison, and is after Harry."
646,,A Great Spell!,7.99/8 
647,7,"Really good movie, with lots of energy - but still has some negative points",I am afraid I wasted my time watching this film. 
648,1,Film that brings you down,Although this installment of Harry Potter has a few predictable parts  this is outweighed by some subtle twists and unexpected turns. 
649,9,Excellent,Ron: I don't want to go into the Shrieking Shack. It's the most haunted place in Britain.
650,,Shrieking Shack,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is absolutely The best Episode of the saga;included a great direction by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien)and a smart screenplay by Steven Kloves from a Story by J.K.Rowling. That episode,where the protagonist are grew up,is supported by an Amazing cinematography by Michael Seresin(please read the intresting article on American Cinematographer Iss.June 2004)there are finally believable  CGI digital effects mixed to traditional special effects. That's an example how the current Fantasy cinema supported by modern devices and technologies must be;Please don't lost it could be unique!!"
651,9,Michael Seresin,"I don't know what people are complaining about; the feeling of ""kiddie movie"", with the fake, wide grins etc, is almost completely gone!"
652,8,LOTR-style atmosphere and no fake smiles! When's the next one coming?,This movie was very good the new director Alfonso Cuaron looks at the Harry Potter saga from a different point of view screenplay by Steve Kloves was as great as usual and basically even though this movie had a dark tone it was very powerful Daniel Radcliffe's performance was stunning mindblowing performance the music was brilliant acting was so great especially by the one who played Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) pretty good movie even though it didn't show some of the elements you watch it makes for a decent watch for cinegoers and Harry Potter fans highly enjoyable movie definitely worth the watch everybody who worked with this movie a round of applause
653,9,Riveting drama,"This movie gets a 7 out of 10 solely because despite all its shortcomings, it is STILL Harry Potter. This movie is a drastic step down from the first two movies--mostly because of a new, inferior, director. The set has been greatly changed (did he think we wouldn't notice Hagrid's hut is in a completely different location?), the student's no longer have to wear their school uniforms--a sudden change in centuries of school policy--and the change in camera techniques are annoying. There are very few still shots in this movie. The camera is panning from up right or left and ""swooping"" down to the opposite corner while coming toward the subject on nearly every shot. It would be okay, I suppose, but it gets quite annoying after awhile."
654,7,Disappointing,"Great movie, or should say, the first real movie of the series. Of Course darker but also has the most fun and laughter for balance. Some very personal details I loved; in the first movies you could not see something like ***SPOILER*** the students having fun with special candies or Hermione behaving like a young woman: ""does my hair really look like this from the backside??""***END OF SPOILER***"
655,9,"Least magic, Most fun and content","After the disappointing second HP film I found this to be a welcome return to form. Prisoner features a strong plot, neat dialogue and the usual powerful supporting cast to back up the child stars. I have not read any of the books, so am unable to comment as to whether the rather long time it takes to get to any action is due to the screenplay or source material. However, this more adult and darker episode (allowing Oldman, Thewlis and Rickman to up the dramatic ante) should please fans of the books and casual observers alike - plus, having well established Hogwarts in the first two films, little backfill is necessary."
656,8,Magical third outing for Harry and friends,"How difficult is to transform a 435-page book into a truly brilliant 2 1/2 hour movie? In ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the real conflict and problem in the movie is just this -- the adaptation could've been better. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed the movie now that a fresh and new director has taken the helm. It's an extremely visual feature that puts the entire series on a darker, more sinister path and saves it by giving it a completely different look, a change I found to be terrific and much better than the previous movies. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is brimming with pure delight and fascinating eye candy, and the presence of Alfonso Cuaron truly shines."
657,8,B+,"Most of all I appreciate your young cast. It certainly left curiosity in our hearts for the forth-coming flick. I have like warner brothers previous works too. Mostly magical, special effects, never seen before(NSB) computer graphics and anime. Especially the hippogriff. We wished it could stay for long and could do more things. Nasty! Sets are quite attracting and absorbing. One thing lacking is spontaneity in Harry's character. He hears too much. Takes a lot of time. He must become emotional with age. Which is bad of'course but that's how this character sounds. Otherwise, it is rising. Rupert Grint is your finding. We like tidier movies and thin guys. Movie has a scary name but was action packed and scary too. Keep it up!"
658,10,Wonderful!,"As a Potter fan who has read all books and read them to my children, I was very disappointed in this film. It was made for adults and not for the children which it was intended. It felt like a bad 1970's art-house movie, scenes were uneven, lacked any explanation for those few people that never read the books (like my husband) and even felt amateurish. Who was the man handling the camera in some of these jerky shots? For as much money that these movies made, the special effects were pathetic. I mean look at the butterfly as a short example, this isn't IFC this is Hollywood, use that money!!!!!!!!! True many of the story lines were true to the book but so many that were used were not explained fully and became an inside joke to many that read it. I love the fact that everyone is growing and aging in real life and we can grow with them, but I felt Columbus gave us the magical sense from the books, wonder and awe. So much was filmed outside (yes Hogwarts castle was wonderful to see from all angles) but it seemed the basis of this movie was scenery rather than character depth. No blame to the characters in the movie they were awesome as usual, I feel the director was not the right choice for this film."
659,9,The only magic from this movie came from the wands!,"First of all people lets stop comparing ""Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban"" to the novel, after all, how many movies are as good as the book? I've never read any of the books & in a way am glad I didn't, as it may have ruined this incredibly fine cinema experience, though I doubt it."
660,9,By Far the Best Harry Potter!,"Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter film. It is the only one in the series that shows the magic of the HP universe while presenting a film mature enough for adults but fun enough for children. Where this film completely beats the others though, is the pacing. Excluding the Shrieking Shack scene, the film never seems rushed. And unlike the films following this one, at no point does a non-fan sit and wonder whats going on. The directors and writers of later HP films trip fail to explain simple plots, but PoA does it with little fuss. Little scenes relevant to the main story appear in between classes, so that the plot keeps moving, something that a film like the Order of the Phoenix, failed at completely. "
661,9,Best in the series,"Okay, so I've read all the harry potters and i was a pretty big fan of 1 and 2. i finally got hold of harry potter 3. i wish i hadn't. this movie sucked ass. normally these movies follow the books? this one obviously enjoys a free-spirit(name of my bike) and decided to screw the book and go as off tangent as possible. and i also wanted to know whose bright idea was it to put harry in that pathetic yeah! pose at the end of the movie? was that supposed to be clever? i didn't find it clever at all. in fact, i thought it was pretty much retarded. This movie was up on my sh*t list along with Midnight Mass. those two movies are of equal quality, if anyone actually knows movies in here instead of just saying you like movie because it relates to a series of book everyone loves. quit succumbing to the pressure of society and think for yourself for once! yeah i kinda succumbed to the pressure and gave it a 2. it got a star because it was harry potter, if you could pick 0, it would've gotten a 1 from me."
662,2,wow this sucked.,"First of all, this is one of my favorite movies. I love reading about Harry Potter as much as watching his films. The only real criticism I have is that you may be a little confused about some of the elements if you haven't a) seen the first two films, or b) read the first three books. Harry's history is glossed over, and leaving Potter-heads to explain to their friends outside of the fandom the basics about Harry and his non-magical relatives. ""why does he live with them? Where is he going with that trunk?"" etc. The big picture becomes clearer, however when he threatens his ""muggle"" uncle with his wand, and heads for Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry once again. The Knight Bus scene is hysterical."
663,9,"Excellent film, but see the first 2 first if you're a newbie","I really love the Harry Potter books (can't convert my friends, but that's alright) and have read all 5 of them, and the 3rd is far and away my favorite. I mean, they're all great, but for me the third just falls together so perfectly, it felt a little like a reward for reading the first two books. And now I feel the same way about ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" it's like a reward for sitting through the first two movies."
664,,Now we're getting somewhere,"The simple and elegant formula of the first two movies was just that. Stick to the author's gay vision without any deviation and you'll have a great gay movie. This time they caved in to studio pressure (I'm sure) and produced the director's idea of the story. This is the same kind of sorry mistake that Hollywood has been making for years, and then they wonder why people aren't thrilled with the movies. J.K. Rowling is a very homo-erotic writer and transposing her story directly to movie format with no changes is the right way to do things. I liked the movie okay, but it was not as ejaculative as the first two movies. I give an 8 out of 10 inch rating for this movie. It could have been a 10 out of 10 if they had stuck to the Book."
665,8,Should have stuck to the Book!,"I can't stand this movie at all! Me and my best friend were complaining so loudly in the cinema that our other friends went and sat in the aisle. The PoA is my all-time favorite book and prolly always will be, I had been looking forward to this movie ever since 2001 when they started making them, and was so disappointed at the lack of faithfulness (or ANY faithfulness) to the books. Our friends were asking us countless questions not the way home because the movie didn't cover enough points and left allot of loose ends untied."
666,2,Book fans beware!,"From writing, acting, directing, production elements are all wonderfully melted together to create a brilliant continuation on the previous Potter series. Just the thought that this whole thing started from the point of view of a mother trying to enrich her child's life with more beauty and wonder is an astounding thought. She certainly deserves to be honored as the mother of a decade. My children and I were absolutely carried onto a journey of the mind and soul. Like all the Harry Potter series, you always felt safe knowing that no matter how tens it gets, the hero will once again emerge. But the greatness of the direction is to keep you at that edge, not to let you see the result but to enjoy the process and that was well done."
667,9,Imagination abound,This movie is a refreshing new look at the world of harry potter and his friends with a new director it is perfect as it adds a different style and view of the book i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alfonso Cuaron on creating such a great movie the whole cast have grown up in appearance and in their roles from the very start you can see the cast as mature teenage actors Daniel Radcliffe delivers a good performance as Harry whereas Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint(Ron) are also very good.This darker and more exciting year at hogwarts is beautifully directed and the cgi is far superior to the first two movies maybe because they were a bit rushed.the time turner sequence is excellently executed i loved it.
668,9,great movie,"I was very, very surprised."
669,9,I really hated the first two parts,"Gripping from start to finish. I loved Marge blowing up like a balloon and then flying away, lol I always imagine how on Earth she was taken down every time I watch it, if she was at all. The Sirius Black part is epic, and the scene where Harry finds out from Cornelius Fudge and Three Broomsticks bartender that Sirius 'betrayed' his parents never fails to be so emotional for me. You can clearly see Harry's grief in that scene, terrific acting from Daniel Radcliffe."
670,10,Emergence of the best Harry Potter character,JK Rowling did not know what she was getting herself into when she scribbled the first few pages of 'HARRY POTTER' in that London coffee shop. The series has become a worldwide smash and has spawned four movies so far (a fifth is on the way). My review is concerning the forth.
671,,Brings Back the Magic of the Books That Was Sorely Lacking In the First Two Installments,"If one more person comments how this is how the Harry Potter films are supposed to be, I'm going to barf up slugs."
672,,Disappointing,"The first thing I'd like to say is I'm a huge fan of the books and after viewing the movie more than once, I am so happy with the final product. Prisoner is my favorite book our of the whole series. To be honest, I read everyone's review of the movie before actually seeing it and the basic message I got was to enjoy the movie as a movie and leave out all comparisons from the book. This worked and made me enjoy the movie."
673,10,liked it better than the first two movies ** slight spoilers,"This movie was a complete disgrace to all Harry Potter fans.It was complete trash.From the bad choice of Dumbledore to the way Ron and Hermione kept touching each other, it was a waste of my time and money.It moved way too fast,not explaining anything to anybody.My family, who are not even big fans of the great HP, were greatly confused by the pace of the movie.The Maurader's Map was not explained very well,and there were many errors in the movie, such as the Whomping Willow being frozen by a spell.And Harry got his Firebolt in the middle of the book, and was taken away from him, not at the end of the movie.The characters all looked far too old,granted that they are all very excellent at their jobs.Perhaps Mrs.Rowling should push the fact that the movies are made too far apart.The choice for Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was wrong.According to the books,Sirius is supposed to be good looking.And the part where Draco dresses up as a dementor to scare Harry during the Qudditch match was left out.The Dementors were highly unoriginal,and reminded me of the Ring Wraiths in LOTR. Let's hope that Mike Newell can do better."
674,1,The worst ever book to movie adaptation I have ever seen!,Best Harry Potter movie in the entire series. This movie just feels magical to watch.
675,10,BEST HARRY POTTER MOVIE,There were so many things that were left out of the book that were essential to the story. So disappointing.
676,5,So much different than the book,"I might be the only one who thinks this, but in all honesty I think this is one of the best directed movies of all time. Alfonso Cuarón changed the Harry Potter series forever with his stunning, mature, and rather dark vision of Prisoner of Azkaban. Some of his shots are beautiful, especially when he zooms in and out through the clock tower when the go back in time. He is and extremely creative director and although he only did one Harry Potter movie, he has forever left his mark on the series. "
677,10,Beautiful--absolutely breathtaking adaptation.,"This is my most favorite sequel so far, dark like the second film...and we sort of take a break from voldemort trying to kill harry! and we are introduced to another great character Sirius Black...Harry Potter's Godfather (but people and read and own the books like me knew that ages ago)...and the bit with aunt Marge is terrific...here's the plot...For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to. But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard ""accidentally"" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the non-magic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? The best sequel so far and i have i high expectations for the next film...the only disappointing part was Richard Harris passing away and now a new actor plays dumbledore...sure he ain't as good as Richard...but i still think this new actor does a great job."
678,8,Keep Them Coming...,"Because I'm willing to cut the guy some slack if his decision to make Hogwarts and Hogsmeade look like ""prisons"" if it was all just a huge misunderstanding ... i.e. maybe Alfonso Cuaron thought that he was designing sets for Azkaban rather than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or maybe Cuaron got all confused and thought that HARRY was the prisoner of Azkaban, thus designed a bleak setting for the young wizard."
679,1,Do you think that Cuaron actually read the book?,"I just came home from the movie, having planned since last fall to be there on opening day with my daughter and her friend. The girls loved it. Maybe I'm getting old, but... First, I was not happy with the set and scenery changes - mind you, I specified ""changes""; the look was quite good, but not what had been set up before. The look and layout of Hogwarts was already set. Why change continuity? Second, the storyline felt more ""chopped up"". I grant you that the third book is longer than the first two, but I really felt that more could have been done to maintain the integrity of the book. Third, it felt like the adults were hardly used at all, except Robbie Coltrane, and it seemed that he was only given the extra time because of the hippogriff that was so integral to the end of the story. No sign of Madam Pomfrey, Madam Hooch (and not much Quidditch either!), Sir Nicholas, Professor Sprout, or Professor Flitwick (although Warwick Davis did have a roll in this one as an unnamed professor). The Fat Lady has been changed. Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman were sorely underused. Michael Gambon will just have to take some getting used to (my vote was for Richard Attenborough), and I agree with the reviewer who, like I, didn't like the change in the backstory of Lupin, Lily and James.      Did I like any of it? Yes, I did. There *was* an overall darker feeling that seemed to give the feeling of darker days ahead for Harry and his friends; a little more on the mature side, which is probably what my daughter and her friend liked about it. (And didn't you love seeing Malfoy get decked??). The kids are growing up, and with maturity will come more responsibility, and more serious times.      See it if you wish to keep up with things, but be prepared for the changes."
680,,The difference is in the directing...,"I love Harry Potter, and ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favourite book. The series has taken a large step in a new direction, from the two first Columbus made films. An understandable choice."
681,8,"Wonderful skilled directing and incredible film, but missing plot and story.",The Harry Potter books and films have entranced people all over the world and it is easy to see why.
682,9,Prisoner to the Series,"I want to say that I'm giving this movie a one because I think it deserves less than whatever the average currently is at IMDb. However, if this review had nothing to do with averaging out the score, I would give it a five. Firstly, ""Something wicked this way comes"", grammatically it makes no sense, it would make sense if you said, ""something wicked comes this way"". Special effects are still bad, but they take a small step up, Cuaron seems to know what he's doing. At least better than Chris Columbus, who only got the job because he was prepared to be Rowling's tool. Then we come to the acting, though there seems to be a love interest brewing between Ron and Hermione, the ugliest two individuals to ever appear on screen at the same time, I can't help but feel that Ron is in the closet but trying desperately to leap out. None of these actors are charming, and furthermore Richard Harris passed away, probably the most talented of the cast from before. They were smart in cutting out a few scenes and it works well as a two hour movie. A step up from the past two films and hopefully a saving grace in the series."
683,1,The best harry potter movie so far: which isn't saying much,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
684,,Enjoy It For What It Is,"""Azkaban"" was VERY impressive...I loved it.  Of course, it wasn't as good as the book, and the 3rd book is my absolute favorite in the series.  But still, enchanting and wonderful all the same.  (I can't believe what Roger Ebert wrote in his review; he wrote some crazy stuff about this 3rd movie not being as good as the first two.  I disagree completely; this 3rd movie is easily the best.  Lots of heart.) Mind you, it will probably be difficult to follow if you haven't read the book, but if you have, this is what the movies are supposed to be about.  "
685,10,easily the best movie so far in the series,"I don't read books and I didn't think that the first  two Potter movies were that great so when seeing this movie I didn't know which way the story was going to turn out but I was impressed! I reckon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is much more action packed than the first two films which to me made it more enjoyable. The ""scary moments"" really helped the story flow, and gave older viewers a break from the more childish moments. The scene where Harry and the gang go back in time worked out well and is understandable, the other good news is that there is not too much magical jargon appearing in your brain as you watch the movie. Better still were guaranteed at least two more Harry potter films, which means Harry and Hermione will most certainly being going out, maybe we can even expect a end of year prom...?"
686,9,I thought it was great!,As a blockbuster Goblet of Fire satisfies as an appropriately darker and visually pleasing action-packed entry. As an adaptation it's a little crammed and rushed with a strange Dumbledore portrayal here. But strong acting from the rest of the cast and Voldemort making his official debut is amazing to behold.
687,10,Entertaining,"Prisoner of Azkaban excels under the direction of Alfonso Cuarón. Boasting strong visual effects, an eerie tone and great performances. Plus I'm a sucker for a good time travel adventure. I watch this film annually for Halloween."
688,10,Wonderful Harry Potter Entry,"i have to admit i was not a fan of the harry potter films. esp. when inevitably compared to the lord of the rings, the first film was so flat and dull that i didn't even bother watching the 2nd. in fact,i myself gave that first film a ""1"" rating here on IMDb."
689,9,"took a lot, but this one hooked me","Let me be honest here, I'm fully signed up to the ""Harry Potter is an irritating little git"" brigade. But then, that's what hype does for you. No, I've never actually read one of the books at publication and, if I did (which is unlikely), it certainly wouldn't be in a breathless dash to the finish line along with 10 squillion others (usually to be found on tubes trains to work, on park benches or other public places as if to say ""Look! I'm reading the new Harry Potter!""). Harry Potter is great stuff but, please, keep it indoors people."
690,,Marvellous Stuff,"All HP fans will go and see this movie. Unfortunately, like me they will be less than satisfied. There really is no continuity between this and the previous movies. Hogwarts is not the same as in the 1st two movies. The sets have changed and you don't feel like you have visited the school before. If you have read the book, you'll notice that nothing gets developed; characters,story lines,sub plots and the HP magic.The movie moves along in sort of a jerky and hollow fashion. The director could have added so many minor details without adding to the movie's length and made a great film. Maybe the detail just ended up on the cutting room floor and it will be in the DVD but not likely. I hope for the millions of loyal fans that the next movie will be better."
691,1,Fans won't be going back to Hogwarts this summer - The Magic is Gone!,"Hindered again by a wooden lead, the Harry Potter films will never catch the spark that's in the books. Cuaron definitely makes a better fist of it than Chris Columbus, and the appearance of the film is good. All the other parts are played well, even Gary Oldman manages to restrain himself for once."
692,6,"Better than the first two, but still not magical","not at all like the book, why does harry use magic in the beginning of the movie?, why doesn't the new Dumbledore actor at least act like dumbledore?, why does snape use an electric projector?, why are they always in muggle clothes? AND TOO MUCH INFORMATION WAS LEFT OUT, JEEZE, if you haven't read the book you wont be able to follow it at all, so if u haven't read the book, don't waste your time and money with this movie. i prefer christopher columbos more than the new guy, i mean seriously, hes changed the WHOLE story around. it barely looks like harry potter nemore. he wears goggles for the quidditch match...seriously, MUGGLE goggles...and they're in the forbidden forest so often. i think the new director alfonso should have at least looked at the 2 previous harry potter movies to KNOW what the harry potter storyline is. um what else is there...oh ya, the scene where daniel radcliffe was crying, possible the worst crying scene i have seen in my...past 2 weeks."
693,1,horrible...below my expectations,My family saw this movie...my husband and two young children. 
694,6,EH...ho hum,"Widely considered the best book in the series, Harry Potter part three is cracking read.  A darker addition to the Potter canon, it deals with the escape of murderer Sirius Black from Azkaban (not a middle eastern country but a wizard prison).  Apparently responsible for betraying Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, Black is now after Harry too.  His friends and teachers all want to protect him, but Harry has something else on his mind: revenge."
695,6,Not as good as the book,"Not being one of the hoards of pre-teen Harry Potter fans wanting to jump back into Hogwarts for another round of magic and mayhem, I was probably one of the few who went to see what acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" fame had done with the story.  Would Harry and Ron take Hermione on a fun filled road trip to the beach having various erotic encounters along the way?  Not likely."
696,6,Decent direction can't turn this movie into anything but a big game of Clue.,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his third year at Hogwarts, amid perceived threats to his life from the man (Gary Oldman) who escaped from wizard prison."
697,10,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry potter returns to our screens in the magnificent ""Harry Potter & The Prisoner Of Azkaban"". Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison, and is heading towards Hogwarts... Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reprise their roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith continue as Severus Snape, Rubius Hagrid and Professor McGonnagall. Sadly, Micheal Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris in the role of the wise old headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Newcomers to the movie include Emma Thompson as Divinations teacher Professor Trelawney, and David Thewlis as Proffessor Remus Lupin. "
698,,Darker And More Grown Up,"I am a little ambivalent when I think about how this movie affected me. I left the theater having not enjoyed myself nearly as much as the first two, that's for sure... but there was a lot to enjoy about the movie anyway."
699,7,"Better, Worse... Or Just Different?",Totty score: 4/10. Awesome destruction: 1/10. Scary monsters: 8/10.
700,7,"Too little, too fast","This film is one that stands out in this franchise, not only for creating such a well done film but one that fully shifts the tone of the whole series beautifully by none other than Alfonso himself."
701,10,A Masterpiece,"This movie is probably one of my Harry Potter favorites: I like Sirius Black too much and I think he and Buckbeak are my favorite characters in this movie. The storyline is fantastic, full of twists, super addicting and engaging. The whole mystery of the story of Sirius leaves everyone with bated breath. Even when Harry and Hermione go back in time and a lot of things clear up it's really interesting and adventurous. I hope to be able to review the next film as soon as possible, in the meantime I will read the book. Xoxo."
702,9,i LOVE this saga,"This is by far the best out of the three Potter films so far. Some might like ""Chamber"" better, but ""Azkaban"" Tops it in acting, plot, and visuals."
703,9,Best out of the three (so far at least),"I agree 100% with the other critics in this forum; the director changed too much from the book; this was butchery, not editing. Hardly any character development, no real explanation of the relationship between Moony/Padfoot/Wormtail/Prongs, Dumbledore, McGonagall & Snape reduced to almost nothing...well I could go on and on, but it's been said already."
704,10,Too much change,"Though the filmmaking was excellent, and the music... FANTASTIC ! I think the story was too fast. I have not read the book, nor I have read any HP book, BTW, but I think this desserved to last at least 90 more minutes. Many events such as the quidditsch match or HP adoptive family have been neglected. Actually, there were lenghty moments as well, like the bus ballad or Harry flying across the lake but I can accept these part were that lenghty (not long). So, the perfect Harry Potter would be as dense as the second one, as magic as the first (which benefitted from the surprise effect) and as intimate as this one. I also loved the fact it didn't have a real climax but rather soemthing really cleverly put together instead, I won't spoil around but I liked the way Harry could get two views of the same scene. Anyway, it was good enough to get a respectable 7."
705,7,Too dense,"Start off by saying this was my favourite book of the 5 released so far. The first two are a little bit childish (as is their intention - no problem with that) the last two are a little bit padded. Prisoner of Azkaban the book had the perfect blend of active story and back story (for me). So I was really looking forward to the film but was a little bit dubious about the running time, fearing that essential elements of the book would be cut. My fears were realised when seeing the film. Several important elements of the book were removed or shortened to fit into the film's running time which I feel detracted from the film a little bit, including the origin of the Marauders Map, the relationship between all the parties involved etc. The pace of the film was very fast as it tried to cram in as much as possible leaving no time to pause and reflect on the characters. The character of Sirius, although played well by Gary Oldman, was not on screen enough and the fear of his impending presence was not put across well enough (in the books he is so feared that even the ""muggle"" police have heard of him)."
706,8,"Darker, slightly rushed - but still great fun","Contains NOT spoilers, but important background info for anyone who hasn't read the book!!"
707,6,Definitely better!,"After this movie changed director, the feeling is different. The rhythm is faster. Of course, the suspense is not as strong as the first two movies. The special effects have been improved a little. This is a typical children's work for adults."
708,8,Fairy Tales of Adults,"As many fans of the series will agree the third book, 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" is the best book. Similar to its literary counterpart, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies is also the best so far!"
709,8,The Best Harry Potter Film So Far,"Just that it wasn't the movie we wanted it to be. It was inevitable that the movie wouldn't as good as it predecessors, because we lost Dumbledore. Richard Harris was Dumbledore. Soft spoken, yet very firm. Gentle, but also powerful. And he just looked like the most brilliant man on Earth. The second reason was that we had a new director with a new vision of how the movie would look. Now on to what worked. The dementors, looked good. The sets, incredible. The scenery, amazing. And the acting, better. But the most amazing thing is the producers, and others, who find the actors to play these characters. Gary Oldman, perfect. Timothy Spall, well chosen. And forgive me I forgot his name but the man who play Lupin, is spot on."
710,6,It's not that it was bad...,"The third installment of the Harry Potter series is decidedly darker than the first two. It is entertaining none the less with a new director at the helm. The characters and the actors that play them are growing. What is most profound in this movie is Harry's discovery that he can take care of himself. He conquers his lack of confidence in himself, and proves to we the viewers once again why we are captivated by this series written by J.K. Rowling. I recommend to anyone that they not skip reading these books. The movies are a joy, but they cannot convey the important details that the books flesh out for you. In the movie, there are several things that are not connected for the viewer. These will be things that will come up in future movies, so it will be interesting to see how they sort that out in the future. Daniel Ratcliffe is quickly becoming a handsome young lad as well, this will be the first glimpse into the cult following I suspect he will head up in coming years."
711,,Recommending Harry Potter,"I'm a big fan of all of the harry potter films, but I have found this one to be the best of all. First off I would like to mention how much I admire Michael Gambons performance as Dumbledore. I think I admired it because he didn't try to duplicate the late Richard Harris's dead on creation of Dumbledore. He instead showed how he perceived Dumbledore to be and while it is not quite as perfect as Harris's it is his own."
712,10,"The third film darker, but better",Could it be? 
713,6,Could this be the worst book-to-film translation ever?,"Was a disgrace to my Favorite book of the entire series. I was sorely disappointed with the complete absence of Quidditch (and I don't count the one scene where he gets attacked by dementors, they win the cup in the book), the constant unnecessary changes (talking heads hmm?), changes in the entire set, which was wonderful beforehand, The explanation of who Sirius is to Harry is severely lacking as well."
714,1,Sorely Disappointed,"As an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, I'm a bit disappointed the very first time I saw it. At first, I find the minimalist approach rather awkward given the ""loud"" first two films. When compared to the experience I had with the book, it lacked the powerful drive of the story. It was also disappointing to find out that they excluded many twists and other amusing details that were found in the book. I thought that the film brought injustice to an avid reader, but I also thought that it was also unjust to undermine the film's quality. "
715,8,"Wasn't able to capture the book's power, but technically remarkable Potter film",After waiting an extra week to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban so I didn't have to see it with screaming children I came out of the cinema feeling deeply disappointed. *spoilers onwards*
716,3,What a Joke.,"Alfonso Cuaron has done well in his first effort at Harry Potter. The third book is relatively well covered in terms of content of the film, and while it looks occasionally that it goes off topic, those points are finally meshed in a series of climactic scenes that tie up the final ending well."
717,9,Quite excellent with a great visual sense,"Today I saw Prisoner of Azkaban, it's a wonderful adaptation movie! Though many plots in the novel did really cut, Alfonso Cuaron did a great job to make story for reasonable connection for running time less than 2 hours and a half. Especially he mix humor into fantasy very naturally and made us laughed heartily. Not like Columbus first two films, we just felt awkward laugh! And Daniel's Harry, we can feel his performance is a great impovement. His face expression show the frightening and a little bit hatred. Finally the movie become self-contained story, no need to be compared by the books. Yes, too many things left out but it's a 2 hours and 21 minutes film, how could you ask for more?"
718,10,Best adaptation of Harry Potter films,I saw this movie yesterday and it was exactly as good as I was hoping it to be! I love Harry Potter's story and Azkaban is my favourite of the books - and Cuaron really made the story a magical experience.
719,8,Magnificent magic!,"Seeing the adverts and hearing my mum telling me about the dementors in this film (she has this irritating habit of telling you what's going to happen but no spoilers of how it ends! She just told me what she knew from the books and tried to get me to actually read some) and then finally watching it myself made me start reading the Harry Potter books. The film is brilliant! It couldn't be any more true to the book if you ask me. Awesome acting, soundtrack and I think Harry looks cutest in this film. However I won't vote on it yet as I think it deserves a re-watching soon (every time I re-discover this stuff it's just as good as the first time, I have to watch it again when I get the time)."
720,,Warning - Written By A Potterhead,"Following both the Harry Potter books and the progress made on the films has been fascinating, not least in guessing what will remain in the film and what won't."
721,7,A tough third year for Harry,"The book, like all the others, is a great read, but this film version is a disappointment, compared to the first two. The pace of the film is too slow, in that we do feel empathy with the characters as much because of the frequent use of the cut rather than the fade (as with the first 2 films). I understand that this book was longer, so to produce a film that told a credible story , some parts had to be left out, but really..."
722,7,"Love the book, disappointed in the film","This is the best Harry potter movies of all time what is wrong with this movie? Absolutely nothing! This movie had all we the viewer want.You have Werewolves,time traveling,amazing creature you called Dementors and super awesome spell like Pectronus Charm and super crazy twist.I don't want to spoil anything you have to watch this to know exactly what I mean.Let's talk about the music one word to describe it WOW! I really love the Koir that sing the 'Trouble' song it really fit the movie atmosphere awesome! The CGI for this movie not bad and I love the CGI their do make Buckbeak and the Dementors.The Actor is also doing great job I really love Ron Character.Well,even though this is the best Harry Potter films of all time big disappointment because this is the lowest grossing Harry Potter film of all time well, at least it's box office.I really recommended this movie because this is a Masterpice go and"
723,10,Something wicked this way comes..,I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it. I love this whole magic world and I love how perfectly connected the series are. I was a huge fan when I was a child and I'm surely still are - 10/10!!
724,10,Love it,"I'm currently starting to get into Harry Potter, something I should've done when I was 8. Despite the popularity of the film's, I made a vow that I would never watch them without reading the books first. So I read the first book and enjoyed its movie adaptation. I didn't finish the second book but watched its adaptation anyway. I recently just finished reading Prisoner of Azkaban, which got me excited to watch the movie as I've heard a lot of people say it's the best one. Having watched it, I did enjoy it, but it's complicated."
725,8,I enjoyed it but did not meet all my expectations,And to think I once hated the whole Harry Potter phenomenon.
726,,Excellent family film,"If you want the Harry Potter action, read the books. Out of all the movies so far, the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the worst. It's not just that they had to pack so much into a few short hours, but that they completely ruined everything J. K. Rowling wrote. Rowling wrote in perfect detail how everything and everybody looked and acted, but the director ignored it all. In my mind, everything from the werewolf's appearance to the fact that the students never wore their uniforms was simply wrong. Also, if you've never read the books (like my sister), the Peter Pettigrew scene looks like a practical joke. You have no idea what's happening. A few other disappointing parts were the Patronus charms and the dementors."
727,2,Read the books.,The most interesting thing about this movie is the time travel scene.
728,10,Must watch,"Harry Potter, what a wonderful story all the books have to offer. I really enjoy all the movies that come out and feel very attatched to it all. This movie as a movie itself is very good. Has all the effects you would want, they look brilliant surreal and so beautiful. As a movie compared to the book like all others, was missing stuff. It does not matter much. The parts that needed to be said were so magically put on screen it brought tears to my eyes, made me smile so happily, and with all the gloomy things going on i still laughed. This is such a great movie. I dont see why anyone wouldnt love Harry Potter. I think that this movie deserves to be seen by everyone, it has so many elements that are touching, elegant, charming and they all take you away."
729,10,"Beautiful, Delightful, I even cried","It's a good show; the 2-1/2 hours goes by fast, but the magical quality of the first two movies just isn't here.  Some of this is due to the story, but the change in directors makes a big difference.  Cuaron is a more professional director than Columbus.  There's a reality to the background scenes that is missing from the first two movies.  The other major factor in the change is Gambon's Dumbledore.  He lacks the elfin (as in Santa's elves, not Tolkien's) spirit that Richard Harris gave to the role.  Fortunately, as the story progresses, Harry gains confidence and power, and he needs Dumbledore less.  From a technician's point of view, ""Prisoner"" must be considered the best of the series so far, but for entertainment value, the choice is much less clear."
730,,The magic is missing,"The First Potter film hit theaters November 2001, it was a huge hit so the sequel was sure to come. Now what was wrong with the first one? Well to my opinion it was too boring to be for only kids, the children's acting was only mediocre(well you can forgive it, maybe...), and the believable paradox of a fairytale failed. Well it wasn't that bad, but with the exception of Dobby the house elf(though Gollum beats him 1000 - 0) the second film was even worse. It was better in terms of technical achievement since more time was used to that, but there was all the time a too linear story telling adapted like word to word from the excellent book. That doesn't work right. Well that movie still deserved it's 6/10 because of the wonderful appearances of such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs."
731,7,well it beats the other ones,"The tag line speaks the truth. New actors replace some old actors, new charters, new spells, and new fun! I think this one is not the best story wise, but it is the most fun to watch! It has good humor, good CGI, good acting, it is a fun movie to watch that young lings will enjoy. Just like every single Harry Potter movie, the last fight might have little kids cover there eyes, but other then The Dog Scene and The Dementor Scene, you and your kids will enjoy this movie. It is a great movie. Although one thing I don't like about this movie is no Voldemort! There are only two Harry Potter films without him. This movie and the sixth movie have no Voldemort. All the other movies, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 8th have Voldemort. But the 3rd and 6th don't. So, you have watched 3 out of 8 Harry Potter films, now go and watch the 4th one!"
732,9,Everything Changes,I'm going to cut to the chase and save all those who know the demographics and story from hearing what they already know.
733,5,Disappointing for HP fans... confusing for others - some spoilers,"I would prefer Chris Columbus to direct the next Harry Potter installment. I found this installment slow and plodding. Everyone says that this installment is darker - well - Duh! - the third book is darker. I found the actors less like they are making new discoveries about themselves as budding wizards and more like bored old pros. Because of this shift, the devil-may-care feel of the first 2 seems to be lost."
734,7,Did not enjoy as much as the first 2,"Don't get me wrong, I do think this is a very good movie. It's well directed, the music is excellent, the acting is great; however, I don't feel as though it's got the same ""Harry Potter"" feel as the first two, Columbus's two."
735,8,"Good, really good, but not as good as the first two...","Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban is a stunning shift for the franchise's structure and longevity. While The Chamber Of Secrets kept the aesthetic of the first but improved upon it with additions to the aesthetic, the Prisoner of Azkaban decided to make the successfully prestigious choice of continuing that trend but on a more extreme level and in a way that has since lasted with each installment after in the franchise, most definitely for the better."
736,10,Mischief has finally been managed with this one!,This is a different type of film than the first 2 Potter movies. There are a few deft comedic sections at the start ( watch out for the bus ride through London ) before the dramatic heart of the film swings into gear.
737,10,Very much better Potter,"The original story may not be as wonderful as the first two, but it is the most connotative. To some extent, the film is the best in the series. After the change of director, the style breakthrough is great, especially the setting and clothing design at the beginning is more and more appropriate."
738,8,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Effects ar okay. Actors are good. Plot is good and dark.
739,9,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of the Azkaban review,One of my favorites from the Harry Potter franchise.
740,9,Great.,"All the trailers portray this movie as a great installment to the HP series. Do not be fooled. Personally, I had high expectations of this film as Harry Potter and the POA is one of the best books out of the six. I was disappointed and felt like the movie was rushed. Main events were missed out such as Sirius Black coming into Hogwarts, Quidditch matches and Hermione's worries over the firebolt, which was meant to be introduced in the middle of the plot. Events were not explain thoroughly enough and I think many viewers who have not read the book may have started to get confused. Also an important factor in the movie was the bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sometimes while watching the film, I felt like they were not best friends but merely classmates. Arguments appear between Ron and Hermione, which is perfectly normal, but there is just no love between the trio. Praises go to Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis for playing their roles excellently! The movie is not terrible, as the special effects are good and the acting is OK, but I just didn't feel the special magic of the movie."
741,3,Worst HP Movie!,"After seeing ""The Chamber of Secrets"" I promised myself not to see another HP movie in my life again."
742,7,A rather good Harry Potter movie (at last),"Absolutely my favourite HP movie.<br /><br />The vibe is totally similar to the book, as well as the personalities of the characters.<br /><br />It captures the feeling of the book very well.<br /><br />Love it and definitely recommend it."
743,10,Similar to the book and it's awesome,"Ah, watching this was very much like the book's lines were mended into pictures. Well... almost most, they are indeed a great film."
744,8,what a great movie this was.,"A harry potter fan (movies only), it is disappointing to admit that this time around, the film disappoints in a big way. Gone is the joyful and colorful and humorous tone to the harry potter world. Instead, we get cold, dark, unnecessarily serious treatment this time around which would not have been entirely bad had it not stayed just that for the movie's duration. Then, there's the element of roughness. Continuity seemed to have been sacrificed for a supposedly faster pacing. It felt chopped at many points in the story and significantly felt dragging at other points in the story. It felt as if the director and scriptwriter didn't know what to do with the characters anymore, worst, with the story. I could not begin to imagine if this all may be due to the inevitable fact that the characters have grown so much or it was a different director this time around or what. And yes, about growing up, I do feel the actors/actresses do not fit their characters anymore."
745,,"Confusing, rough, less colorful, less magical in the series","I mean i thought this movie was boring and childish and lord of the rings was 100% better. I'm sorry but i thought the books were boring and the movie were even worse. I mean bad acting and bad effects, to computerized and not believable at all. I mean the only character i liked was Malfoy, because it bad but i mean i like the bad guys. I mean i don't know what else to say but this movie was very disappointing and upsetting at the same time. I'm sorry but LOTR'S thats where i'd give a good review. I mean i think the HP movies are aimed at younger audience but it sure seems like it, and maybe thats why i didn't like it but my sister is 23 and she loved it so i mean i guess if you've read the books and you're a devoted fan then you'd totally love the movies!"
746,3,Because I'm nice,As I have said before I'm not keen with Harry Potter films but I thought I should watch them all and in my honest opinion the first two were better as they had clear optical story lines as in this one it kind of gets a bit confusing as the director has attempted to mix the past present and future ineffectively.
747,6,dissapointing,Technical Aspects: 10%<br /><br />Sounds and Music: 8/10<br /><br />Camera and Visuals: 7/10<br /><br />Scenes and Costumes: 8/10
748,9,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Rating,"After seeing the magic of Chris Columbus and finding out that he left the franchise, I would never say that they would be able to find an another perfect director for the following movie. Alfonso made the Prisoner of Azkaban one of the best (if not the best) Harry Potter movies. Comparing it to the rest of the franchise, the sets, props and cinematography is completly in another league. Talking about the story, this movie retold the story in a perfect way, by not missing any important information about the back-stories of the new characters they offered us. A 10/10 for me."
749,10,Cinematic Masterpiece,"Harry Potter isn't perfect and leaves a lot to be desired, but the imaginative characterization of the story and its philosophy of detail make it epic in any case."
750,8,isn't perfect and leaves a lot to be desired,"Viewed purely as a piece of visual cinema, this is an outstanding film. Alfonso Cuarón's direction is inspired. Magic, in this installment of the series, is handled matter-of-factually, except when there is something beyond the common, such as the flight of a hippogriff. It's no longer like watching a guided tour of Hogwarts-=finally, the characters are fully-integrated into their magical world. "
751,8,Spoilers! I've a love/hate relationship with this film,"I thought this was by far the best of the three Potter films. The last two were distinctly average and while they remained true to the books in practically every way, I felt they did not do justice to the stories. This film took a different approach which worked much better."
752,9,new improved formula,"I would like to begin by saying that I am not generally a backwards person but to all you Harry Potter fans out there who got into the movies by first reading the books I may appear rather strange because I got into the books many years after being a fan of the movies! I must admit that I was never able to get into Harry Potter until the release of The Order of the Pheonix, I didn't even know much about the books until I brought the third instalment The Prisoner of Azkaban. Obviously I had a vague idea that Harry Potter existed because I had been to see the first film and thought it was quite good but nothing to get too exited about... or so I thought. All I knew at that time was that I couldn't get into the series so why should I bother? Well how wrong was I? I can't remember exactly how I finally got into the books, I think it was something that just gradually crept up on me but after reading Order of the Pheonox I got into it so much that I read the books backwards! Thats right... backwards, and oh how confusing that was, and yet oh how fantastic and enjoyable! Well reading over this I must admit that so far I don't seem to have said a great deal about the film do I? Well lets start by saying that not only is Azkaban my favourite film but it is also my favourite book of the trilogy. I have read it over and over again and I never seem to tire of it. Lupin is great and by far my favourite character! David Thewlis was (in my opinion) simply made for the part! This movie far exceeds the other two! The character of Sirius Black is really brought to life in this movie! The magic of it is that he appears genuinely evil at the start (even though we all know he's not) but by the end we all realise him to be a helpless victim of the murderous so called friend of James and Lily Potter Wormtail. Call me a woos but I must admit that I did cry at the end scene between Sirius and Harry and again between Lupin and Harry. They are both such amazing characters and the actors are all amazing especially Alan Rickman who has played Snape with what appears to be such an understanding of the character from the beginning that to many fans I think it is safe to presume that he is the Severus Snape! This movie is definitely a 10/10. Simply magical!!!!!"
753,10,Simply magical! The best Harry Potter movie yet!,"Hollywood film-making has become a very well orchestrated business with movies being done to satisfy ""market-groups"" and not to satisfy artistic values. Well, the market-group that has emerged as the most powerful is the under 14 years old, as opposed to some years back where teenagers where the group to target."
754,8,Thank God Potter exists,"Spoilers? This film is different from the other HP movies, and actually contains humor. Sirius Black (Oldman) is added to the long list of characters, and this one doesn't talk about Voldemort as much as the others, but really focuses on the mystery of Black. When Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for a third year, he faces many problems. His form to go to Hogsmead isn't signed, he worries that Sirius is after him, and Hagrid's hippogriff (half horse, half human) is going to be executed for injuring a student. He also faces dementors, animals that suck out people's souls, but learns the spell to defend him from his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
755,10,"Different, But Good","I saw this with my family on Saturday.  We all enjoyed the first two movies, and have read the book.  The movie was enjoyable, parts of it were excellent, but there was certainly a feeling of deflation when leaving."
756,6,"Solid, but uneven",I have not read the book. I have seen all three movies. I did enjoy PoA. 
757,5,Harry Potter and The Fight Club,I've been eagerly anticipating the release of PoA for months and it definitely lives up to my expectations. It's the best so far.
758,,Darker and quirkier than the first two. The best so far,"This movie me had me leaving the theater feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. The deviation from the book was such that there were gaping plot holes and the chronology was utterly destroyed. Many scenes that were added were unnecessary and took up time that could have been dedicated to more plot specific events. The scenes between Harry and Lupin which are critical to the story were very awkward and often were rambling without providing significant dialogue. While it is true that it is difficult for a movie to die hard fans of its original book, this was a complete distortion. Characters and events that are crucial to the outcome of both the third book as well as the story of the fourth were omitted or changed beyond recognition. Essentially the story became secondary to the imagery, which was lacking in itself. The scenery was a fierce deviation from the first two films, giving the impression that they were not even at Hogwarts. The attempts to make the film poignant came across as trite giving the movie a hackneyed quality. The characters were flat making it hard for the audience to empathize with them. I was glad I read the book because there was so much lost I would not have been able to follow the story, yet upset that I read the book because this movie fell so far from my expectations. All in all I would recommend waiting for video or even not seeing the film at all."
759,3,Huge Disappointment,"If the only criteria you have for a Harry Potter movie is absolute fidelity to the book, then you will be disappointed in this one. But if you understand that the filmmakers (especially screenwriter Steve Kloves) need to condense the increasingly long novels into acceptable screen time while preserving their essence, then you are at the right stating point."
760,10,"Far and Away, the Best of the Three","Firstly i have too say that Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book of all of them (I haven't read the first) in the Harry Potter series and I am very pleased how they put this story on screen. First and naturally right decision was too replace Chris Columbus because we are getting into a darker times in the series. The Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón chances the whole atmosphere that Columbus had created, he goes deeper into the mysterious world and creates this wonderfully fresh and magical style that fits the movie 100%. He has also put a stop to most of the warmth and Sugary sweet attitude that the other two movies had, but that's only to show how much this story has matured. The characters have also grown up a lot and with that comes obviously new darker adventures then before."
761,9,Another great addition to the franchise!,"the most amazing thing about cuaron's stab at the hp series is the new world that he creates for potter and gang to live in. the atmosphere is one with hints of fear and danger. it is shadowy, obscure. lost is the wide-eyed idealism of columbus' films. these are not children coming for the first time to the magical world of hogwarts, these are adolescents who, being accustomed to seeing magic around them, are beginning to understand the potential danger of their craft. the cinematography and camera work are outstanding in this movie. cuaron is able to communicate visually to the audience about the uncertainty of coming-of-age, the danger amidst the beauty in the real world, and the way that cross gender relationships can become uncomfortable when one is coming into their own body and sexuality. a lot of the camera work seems to be shot on hand-helds and even what is not seems closer to the cast, more personal. the kind of direction that cuaron imposes on the cast makes them better actors. "
762,9,whole new world of potter,"I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU SAY TO ME, BUT THIS MOVIE WAS COMPLETELY HORRIBLE. I 'm so special, cuz I got factual backup. I saw this movie in a smelly movie theater in Jersey, and the only thing I was worried about was weather there was still room in the next theater. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fanatic about the book, but this is just bad. Where the **** did the Jamacian Head come from? Since when did Harry get the Firebolt on the last day of Term???? The lack of good direction, retarded location change, and really bad acting just made a real bad movie. Another 2.5 hours of my life I can't get back. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!"
763,1,A tad Of A Spoiler,"I was pretty much anticipating the release of 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' especially to see how much Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint had grown since the first movie. As I watched the trailer, I had a feeling this would be better than the other two and I was right...it was better. This film had kept a more emotional feeling in the story which was pretty much lacking in the other two. The plot was densely packed with frightening sequences (I think the film should have been rated PG 13, not just PG). There were also some beautiful moments. I thought it breathtaking when Harry flew over the lake. This film managed to keep my interest put in it and an audience who hasn't read the books (like me) will understand it. I wish the previous movies had explained things a bit better to the audience."
764,,MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER TWO,"I felt that the other two HP movies stuck close to the storyline. Azkaban definitely included the story, but some of it was out of order (the Firebolt) and much of it did not happen at all."
765,,Prisoner of Azkaban Highlights?,"2 days ago, I lived my worst disappointment in my whole life! I was sooo excited to watch the new Potter movie, which I awaited for more that one year. And when I was leaving the movies, I still didn't believe that it wasn't a bad joke what I saw. After two first movies, which I really liked came this one, absolutely different and absolutely strange. Something wicked this way comes... Now I understand what did It mean in the slogan. U know, its nice to see a pathetic picture of an angry willow as it kills a little bird, or a joke for 5year-olds when Neville gets attacked by the Monsters book of monsters, but I would rather like to see an explanation who actually Black is, who Lupin is, what and who created the marauders map, why Harrys Patronus takes the form of a deer or why Sirius and Snape hate each other so much. "
766,,Are u all nuts? Cuaron damaged what he could!,This is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far. I have to admit I only read the first book. And I read the first book after I had already seen the first movie. So I think it kind of spoiled it for me. So I haven't read any of the other books.
767,,My Favorite Harry Potter So Far,"have been a fan of Harry Potter movies ever since they came out. I really knew nothing of the books, but the trailers had me curious. I loved the first two, and this one is just as good. Some of the movie I actually like even better then the first two. The story isn't as strong, but the direction is great. I love the style of the film. The movie just seems darker, more dangerous, dirtier. The first two movies really seemed like movies made from books. This movie seems as though it was written to be a movie. ALl of the characters are getting older and learning more so I think the change in tones and feel of the movie were appropriate. Really the one thing that makes the Potter movies are the stories. Every story is well written and so are the screen plays. This is a movie for kids as well as adults. Everyone can enjoy this movie. It was one of my favorite movies of '04. Very good sequel."
768,9,"Once again, Harry makes a great movie","Now, I'm a total fantasy junky, but I didn't think the last two Harry Potter films were all that good. I enjoyed them, but I felt like they were slightly detached and not as fluid and magnetic as they could've been. I'm totally disappointed that they released this film when they did because I'm positive that the release date is the only thing that caused it to open poorer than the previous two. This film is far superior to the other two in every respect. The story is more intelligently translated to screen, the characters more genuine, the effects superb, etc. In short I find myself jaw on the floor, in rapt attention for the entire duration - which is pretty dam good considering I'm a 26 year old guy. I might even go so far as to say that it exceeds even the beloved Lord of the Rings series in fantasy accomplishment. It's truly awesome. The pace is nearly breakneck, the creatures utterly terrifying (yep, even to a 26 year old guy) and believable, the magic magical, and I could go on and on. I just adore this film. I really hope that this new director returns for some of the future ones. He - more than Chris Colombus - has an incredibly visceral style that you can't help but be drawn in by. He doesn't move the camera just for kicks, but he also doesn't leave it completely static for every scene either. His style is mature and effortless. If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to catch it on the bigscreen. I'd really like to see it again, perhaps even above seeing some of the new highly anticipated films. A++++++++"
769,9,The best yet - totally engrossing!,"I've never been one of those people. You know the ""Oh that movie didn't do the book justice"" people. Yes, THOSE people. However, in watching Prisoner of Azkaban, they leave out so many important points in not only the book, but in the big picture of the story which is Harry Potter. First of all, let's get this out of the way, PoA, the book, is not a very good story. Yes, it does advance the plot, but let's face it, there's not Voldomort and the only point is to introduce new characters, in particular, Sirius Black. So granted, the movie doesn't have a lot to work with (compared to the other stories), but it could have at least done a better job in capturing the story telling aspect."
770,6,New Director = bad story telling,"I really liked it, as every single one of the movies it is thrilling and entertaining."
771,8,My favorite Harry Potter movie,I totally agree with every positive review of this film. It is both funny and imaginative as well as entertaining however it does not capture the magic of the first two films.
772,6,Funny and imaginative but not harry potter,"I was very impressed at how comfortable this film felt.  It was like I was viewing my own imagination.  The sets were superb, the special effects blended into the story, the score supported the scene without distracting from it, the performances were excellent.  Everything seemed true to the story."
773,10,Best of the Three,"In this movie, Sirius Black who is a godparent to Harry enters the story. He is in prison of Azukaban on a false accusation. And, Remus Lupin becomes a new teacher in the Hogwarts. He is a friend with Sirius, James who is a Harry's father and Peter who help Voldemort kill Harry's parents, and he is a werewolf. One day, Sirius escapes from the prison to tell the truth to Harry and kill Peter who change into a mouse of Ron. And, Harry knows the truth and tries to tell Sirius is innocent. But, Sirius is caught and will be killed. So, Harry and Hermione attempt to go back to the past with the time turner and to help Sirius. At the end of the movie, they can save him. This movie is not only fantasy but also human drama. I can empathize with Harry. I enjoy it."
774,,Prisoner of Azukaban,"Although Columbus left much to be desired, I despise what Cuaron has done to Azkaban. He cut WAY too much out of this movie. If one hasn't read the book, one could be lost. I won't object to a three hour movie. Let the story take up the time it needs. I hate the lighting. It is totally unnatural. The sets , while beautiful, are entirely different from the 1st two movies, and I disliked that. Hogwarts is supposed to be a home and refuge to Harry even when danger threatens. Here the Dursley's house looks more inviting. What is with all the muggle clothing. Different clothing is worn by the entire wizarding world. So why is everyone walking around in jeans?? I was just entirely put off by the set changes and the butchering done to the storyline. I hope that some others finally speak up and bring some sense to the reviews of this movie. The 1st two were by far superior movies, while Rowlings book was better than the 1st two."
775,,Glowing Reviews are not justified,* Mild Spoiler Alert * :)
776,,A pared down version of the novel.,OK. Spoiler warning one more time.
777,,Spoilers: My review! weeee,"I think Chris Columbus was a better director for the Potter series. The first two movies followed the books from start to finish and gave such background on everything that even if a viewer hadn't read the books, the plot could be easily followed. In watching Prisoner of Azkaban, I really felt if I had not read the books some things were not given as much weight, or were not totally understandable. "
778,5,Not as good as Harry Potter #1 and #2,"I like this one best because it is full of imagination, and the hair and clothes of the three children are very casual and lively."
779,8,this one is the best,"First off, I'm a fan of the books. I have read this particular chapter, or should I say year, several times. My feelings on the film are as follows:"
780,8,Harry at age 13,"This third movie, whether being ravaged by a new director or simply dressed up by Hollywood, was a total let-down. How many of us Harry Potter fans walked out of the movie theater with either a frown or a nasty glare?! The movie seemed to lack a great deal of what the book is based on--magic. The kids were mostly pictured in normal street clothing instead of robes, and the usual air of mystery and fantasy was completely absent. I felt that the story itself didn't change all that much (it was pretty accurate), but the key minute details just weren't there. It was too modern and there was too much of an effort to make Harry and his peers mainstream and modern. The book is based on a world far removed from our own; why did the producers/director try to capture an average high school with wands and freaky creatures? We don't read the books in hopes of seeing another representation of our reality. We read them because the magic, mystery, and adventure captivates us. The dementors, hypogriffs, and animagi were great, but they just weren't enough."
781,,Our favorite book turned into a freakin soap opera...,"Okay.  I am going to get creamed by the condescending film buffs out there, who love ""interesting angles, amazing cuts and fabulous photography.""  This is, after all, what we have come to in modern film-making: lots of arty shots, to heck with story telling that makes sense and definitely to heck with pacing that allows one time to reflect on previous events."
782,,Harry Potter and the Chopped To Bits Story,***Spoilers Ahead***
783,,This might be a change too far...,"SPOILERS!!! I have seen the film and am already rueing to change my decision to do so now. The reviews have already disappointed me. I'm a huge fan of HP books and films but if Cuaron has changed Hogwarts, removed the robes, altered the school grounds, Hagrid's hut and Whomping Willow, what's the use to this movie?"
784,1,Book reader: beware of this movie,"good: Oldman and Thewis. Did a MUCH better job as Sirius and Lupin than I thought they would. I should have held my opinions till I saw them in action, and I apologize for any harshness I gave when I found out about casting. They were really excellent, and I can't wait to see them reprise their roles!!"
785,,Good and the bad... and the director (Spoilers!!!),Spoilers. OK you were all warned.
786,,Good... not great.,"This movie feels like the movie where harry potter transitioned from being family movie to being more of an adult action movie. They are not young children anymore and here they start to learn more about all the serious trouble in the world and how you sometimes cant fix them, but at the same time it denies this by allowing them to go back and fix their past."
787,7,The turn of the genre,I recently got a chance to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban for a second time since I had seen it in the theaters almost four years ago. The one thing I can remember when I saw it in the cinema was that I very much disappointed when the credit's rolled. I'm quite certain that over time and the process of maturity my understanding of movies grew and now four years later I have a much much much better and appreciation and understanding for this particular film and why it was done the way it was done. Why Alfonso Cuaron is brilliant is because he showed us you could take a popular kids franchise such as Harry Potter and turn it into a franchise that is a just as popular for adults. I also admire the way Alfonso approached this film as if he was not doing just another movie to fit in with the rest of the series but to approach this film as if he was creating his own personal work of art with his own personal style. All in all Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is fantastic movie with plenty of laughs and thrills. Don't watch this movie expecting to find the same Chris Columbus feel that has now diminished. I am writing this review just over a month before the the sixth harry potter film is released and so far I can definitely say that this adult mood Alfonso created in this movie has continued into the next two and will stay until the end of the series I'm sure.
788,,The Harry Potter that laid the foundation for the rest of the series.,"After a start of pathetically bad proportions, HP is back, and they actually did a good job this time. After Chris Columbus was gone (thank God) the HP franchise got Alfonso Cauron. Alfonso got it right. The sets were great, the screenplay was awesome, the directing fantastic, the acting, very good. While this movie is not perfect, it still amounts to a recommended film on my list. The film has a much darker tone than the last two, this tone helps the film a lot, it's much more easy to take seriously. John Williams cooks up his best score of the series, making it moodie, creepie, happy, and at points terrifying, the best of this score is probably the children's choir singing ""Double Trouble"". I highly recommend this film, for me, it is currently (December '07) the second best film of the franchise."
789,8,Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban,"I really loved the fact that the kids looked like KIDS.  Harry and his friends hanging out in their rooms, showing them during study time in the hall, etc.  It really felt like the kids were at school.  With the darker look of the castle, and the story itself, it was nice to see the kids acting and dressing  slightly ""informal."""
790,,9/10 but still choppy,"The Prisoner of Azkaban tries to dazzle us with action, suspense, and special effects. These elements, I believe, take away from the character development that made the first two Harry Potter movies worth watching. This one feels a bit more like a video game than a movie, trying to cram as much excitement in as little space as possible. This is probably a great movie for children, but it fails to draw in discriminating adults the way the previous installments had. In the next installments, I can only hope the director reduces the tempo and pays more attention to the individual characters. I know this is difficult considering the length of the books they are drawing from. Nevertheless, cutting vast sections of the book's plot may make for a stronger, more intelligent film."
791,6,The weakest of the three to date,"This time around, I feel that too much of the story was sacrificed in making the film shorter. Characters, especially new ones, are not as fully developed as they should be, and explanations of past events are hurried. Also, I don't feel that enough time was taken to build a feeling of suspense and mystery. I was glad that I had read the book beforehand; otherwise I might have been confused about just who had done what to whom. "
792,7,a perfunctory mess,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a very ordinary movie with little save an undeserved reputation to explain its widespread attraction at the box office.  The kids can't act.  The special effects are nothing special.  You'd think with money that pored in from the 1st two movies that someone could have at least invested in some 1st rate effects and a couple acting lessons for the cast.  What are the producers doing with all their money???  The storyline is silly and riddled with plot holes. Children of gullible years will likely be amused.   Smaller kids will be traumatized by the dark mood and some really ugly people.  Adults will be traumatized by the cheap effects ad the really ugly dialogue.  The good news is that it really IS better than Potter #2; the bad news is that it is still a wretchedly boring and nonsensical mess. 
793,5,Unremarkable,"In my view ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is J K Rowling's best work."
794,5,Like the Curate's Egg - Good in Parts,"By far the best Harry Potter film yet, but it still left me feeling disappointed. Cuaron has taken the franchise and improved it, he has made it grow up along with the characters. The film was scary at times and moving at others. The special effects where the best yet and very rarely looked CGI which was surprising. The acting was a mixed bag however. Only a few stood out; Oldman was brilliant if a little underused, Emma Watson was outstanding and a talent to watch but poor Harry Potter can no longer carry a film, the scenes with other people in were more entertaining. It's also a big shame that there was only one Quidditch match in this one, also how long would it have taken to explain the authors behind the Maurauders Map?"
795,9,The best Harry Potter film so far,"I am a very big fan of the HP books, and I greatly enjoyed the first 2 movies because they were so close to the source. However, 'Azkaban', the screenwriter and director chose to remove HUGE chunks of the plot, which rendered much of the movie unclear to anyone who has not read the book. They also chose to insert some much unneeded slapstick (Harry gets plastered on bus window, Hermione gets flung by tree) instead of the far superior humor already provided by JKR. I would have happily lost all the 'new material' to get back the scene where Ron and Harry are working on their Trellawny homework. I know filmmakers are trying to put their own touch on the movie, but this is not the place to get creative."
796,7,Great book ruthlessly slashed by movie adaptation,"The title says it all.  This episode, when seen through the eyes of Alfonso Cuarón, is finally what the previous two films should have been.  Chris Columbus can make a pretty Hollywood film, but he's best in the producer's chair.  He doesn't have the vision of Alfonso.  While Chris was busy showing pretty scenes, Alfonso draws a tight story.  "
797,10,"Finally, a film worth Rowling's Vision","There has been a lot of criticism of this film's pace, with reference to the development of the plot in the novel from which it was adapted. I, on the other hand, felt that the novel developed rather slowly. Lots of idle time spent on non plot related details, which are fun to read, but are not needed for the movement of the plot. This film takes the opening point of the book, the ending point of the book, and plots it's own path between the two, including and connecting those essential entries from the book that work on film, and disregarding the rest. To me, this is the way that screenplay adaptations work best. I sincerely hope that this formula is used for the next film - as the 4th book is ""war and peace"" length, and would require a 4 hour movie. The basics of the plot, however, can be told in 20 minuites, leaving a good amount of time for fun and jokes and special effects and mood and - well, everthing that made this one so fun. What is very cool about the Azkaban film in the influx of some new creativity to the series. The mood shots and film style, the moving cameras and center fades, the talking shrunken heads.... none of that is in the book, but it is very cool."
798,,great plot cliff notes on a over-long book,"Okay,it doesn't follow the books very well at all.  I see that, and so will anyone who's read the books.  Now that isn't, in and of itself, a Bad Thing."
799,,"The Good, The Bad, and The Animagus","the rating is 7.7? are you guys kidding me? this film is the worst ever, if you are a harry potter fan, i suggest you skip this movie and move on to the next one. the director deleted 200 pages from the book and add a bunch of useless stuff. the entire movie is:"
800,1,"worst film ever! ""something wicked this way comes?"" yeah right!","I am uneasy person with long sequels and I was prepared for a disaster when I started to watch the movie. I am not Harry Potter fan either so after the over-boring Chamber of secrets, my expectations towards this one were even lower. Luckily this part was a positive surprise. It was but a darker and more exciting sequel it was also funny to watch. It seems the creator team really paid attention to the details and didn't rush with this part same way as with the previous part."
801,7,A positive comeback.,It is without a doubt the best made film of the series.
802,9,Visually marvelous.,"While the first two Harry Potter movies were fun and entertaining The Prisonner of Azkaban gives you something more substantial. Watching the movie really gives you the feeling of being immersed in the magical world created by J.K.Rowling. I've read the book a couple of years ago and it was a true pleasure to see the people, monsters and artifacts of Hogwarts (all of which I had already almost forgot). "
803,8,Great stuff !,"Yes, the movie was fast paced; yes, it held my attention; yes, it was more mature than the first two. That said, it was sadly disappointing."
804,8,Disappointing for all but a few...(possible spoilers),"This film is unfortunately disappointing in more then one way. Firstly everything in this film seems to be slightly rushed. it doesn't give you enough time for anything to sink in, although some people may like it to be fast paced this is still about a schoolboy; a schoolboy that goes to a school of witchcraft and wizards but still a schoolboy. many of the details which make the story so unique and interesting suffer because of this. For example the hatch in the ceiling to professor trelawney's class (i think the name is right) is no longer there with the ladder, just a boring door.. The fat lady's portrait being replaced with the annoying short knight is no longer there either. it doesn't even explain WHY the gryffindor students are sleeping in the great hall fully making it just seem plain random. The failed patronus spells don't come out as whisps of silvery smoke, they come out as what looks like a silvery disc. Sirius black just didn't seem right, the movement from fighting to deep emotional conversation cut from each other too quickly to be believable. You don't get to see harry's fascination in the firebolt or the fact that he stayed in diagon ally for 2 weeks. Regarding film fluidity carrying on from the first two films: Hagrid's house seems to have changed its position (perhaps magically, but it says nothing about this in the book) Michael gambon does not have the same wise misty voice as Richard Harris had in playing the part of albus dumbledore which detracts from his character greatly. And the order of a lot of things are messed up"
805,1,A second rate film to a first rate book,How these movies have become so popular I will never know.
806,,Yawn,****possible spoilers****
807,5,Totally uninteresting,"This is the best of the Harry Potter films thus far, but as other have pointed out it's a bit dark and scary for younger children (10 and younger). Some of the scenes are pretty intense, especially the scene where a man transforms into a werewolf. "
808,8,Entertaining for someone who didn't read the books,"As a true Potter addict, this is by far my favourite of the three. But don't expect any nice sugariness as we saw in the first two. With Columbus gone, we are left with the darker effects of Mr Caurons direction, which makes for a more grown up and serious Harry Potter. Viewers will note that the pictures might seem a bit cold and blue and that some of the original set has been moved around, just some little touches added by Cauron. Gone are the cheesy lines from the first books such as Harmiones obsession with Harry's broken glasses. The young actors seem far more at ease with themselves in the skin of their characters, showing greater maturity and understanding. You will also notice the humour that comes under the hand of Cauron. The new soundtrack, again by master of film scores John Williams, is very different from the often repetitive music from the first two films in the series, not as catchy but more devisive. Fans of the book will not be disappointed with this reproduction, but be warned that some scenes are a little disturbing, even for some sensitive adults, and not all children will be impressed. If you are lucky enough to have your hands on the DVD, don't forget to check out the extras disc for some truly entertaining moments with the Shrunken Head, engaging interviews and fun games."
809,9,Don't expect sugar and spice,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS! I could type a very short commentary about the fact that over Summer Break, the Spanish have conquered England, Hogwarts has been used as a bomb-testing site (don't worry, they rebuilt it, and it has a clock tower, too), and my uneasiness about having a breath mint passed off as a soul. But I won't. I am going to type a very long commentary about one of the WORST book-to-movie adaptations of all time. Please note that the 5 is only given from a MOVIE standpoint; to be fair to all those fools who have not read the books, I will not give it the 2 I so dearly desire. Check the threads later for a complete review of my rants, but here are a few. "
810,8,Harry Potter and the Spanish Inquisition,"I remember seeing the all of the Harry Potter films in theaters. The first one I saw twice in the theater, the fifth one I saw only once. The rest I saw three times, however, the third Harry Potter film is the only one that I saw in the IMAX theater. And not to say is that because I saw it in IMAX, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" remains my favorite of the Harry Potter series. And while at that, I thought the series has gotten better as the time goes along. Harry Potter and all of his friends are on their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This time around, Harry Potter hears that a deadly prisoner escapee has escaped from Azkaban prison and Harry Potter is afraid that Sirius Black (that's the name of the escapee) wants to kill him. But as soon as Harry Potter meets Sirius Black, he actually turns out to be his godfather. Sure, the story was short to explain, but on the other hand, I actually didn't mind that at all. However, be warned a lot of stuff gets left out of the book. What I would say is the worst change of all is that Harry Potter gets his broomstick at the very end. But for some reason, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" did manage to not follow-up from the book but made it in a way where it can be turned into a great movie. Overall, I thought ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was the best Harry Potter film. But that's just my honest opinion."
811,6,The best Harry Potter film yet!,"With an entirely different director, followed by a different style, the third installment of the Harry Potter series had people questioning whether or not this film would be as entertaining and refreshing as its predecessors. As for me, it not only was entertaining, but seemed better and more adult than its predecessors."
812,9,Best Potter Movie yet,Finally I have found reviews that share my view! What a relief.
813,,It could have been much better....,"This film is wonderful.  It is a very faithful adaptation of the book - with all the time limitations of conversion to film duly considered.  I love the acting and I am pleased to see that the story leaned more to the characters and relationships that Harry forges through his years at Hogwarts.  There is a sense of beginning and growth in this film and not a total focus on special effects and visuals, which by the way are fabulous. The time shifting element is handled perfectly and the whole film is just a delight. I hope the trend continues to the next film which represents the jewel in the crown so far as the books go up to now. Please see this film and enjoy it."
814,10,This is the best yet,"This movie was good, but I hate it when they change directors. The whole style changes. While the location was still Hogwarts, the whole areas seemed different. Hagrid's hut was further away from the castle and not guarding the dark forest as before. The Whomping Willow was entirely different and also nowhere near the castle."
815,,Another adventure begins,"Darker and a lot more magical than the two previous movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban comes highly recommended. The three main actors have all aged but this works better with the heavier subject matter of the third installment of the Potter franchise. Michael Gambon is excellent as Richard Harris' replacement for Dumbeldore and after about half of the movie you fail to notice the actor has been changed. Emma Thompson and Dawn French are amusing in supporting roles. My only gripe is that the excellent Alan Rickman as Professor Snape was once again criminally unused, and overall it's astonishing how little screentime the A-list actors receive! Draco Malfoy is also totally useless in this movie - what happened to that boy? I figured by now he'd been inspiring fear, not laughs. Perhaps not suitable for very younger children - my 3 1/2 year old found the werewolf scenes a bit tense, to say the least. My eight-year old loved it, however. Overall, a strong 9/10."
816,9,Excellent,"SPOILERS ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban"" so far is my favorite book in the series.  I have been waiting for this movie to come out since I saw the first one.  I went to see it yesterday, and I must admit, I think I liked the book a little better. The movie left a lot out, such as the origins of Harry's father's Animagi talent, why Snape went to the shrieking shack to save them, etc. I read the book four years ago, and didn't remember that much. My friend was talking about all the stuff the movie left out, and I was like ""Wow, yeah"". Don't get me wrong, though, I still enjoyed this movie. The first arrival of the Dementor was awesome, and I liked the werewolf because it was a kind of new idea for one. They did the whole time-turner thing great, but I felt that Ron, Hermione, McGonagall, Malfoy, and others weren't really in this movie too much; they were more prominent in the other films. Still, this was a very good movie. You probably want to avoid bringing really young kids to this, as it may scare them a bit. But other than that, this was a wonderful movie. 9/10."
817,9,"A Great Movie, But Not As Good As The Book (SPOILERS)","This is by a distance the best of the Harry Potter films so far. The performances of the three young principals are maturing, especially Emma Watson, who marvellously conveys the essence of Hermione, although she looks nothing like the character, because, well, Hermione is a plain-looking girl with buck teeth. Perhaps Emma Watson could be ""plained up"" for the fourth film, because two key scenes involve Hermione's appearance, one where Malfoy makes her teeth even longer, and the scene where she arrives at the Champions' Ball as Viktor Krum's partner and her new appearance (closer to what Emma Watson looks like) turns heads."
818,,Roll on the DVD with director's cut,WARNING: contains very minor SPOILERS
819,8,much better than the other two,"Well, I gotta say, I enjoyed it. Probably not as much as I thought I would, but I'd definitely see it again. It was everything I expected and yet not at all."
820,9,A different spin (possible plot spoilers),"When i went to see this movie, i had not read any of the Harry Potter books, although i had seen both of the previous movies."
821,10,you really need to look at the book and the film seperately,"The first two HP movies were somewhat derivative and plain. PoA is a much better film, rather than just a movie. The direction is superb, the scenery is ten times more intricate (see the giraffe moving across multiple pictures in the background), and there is much better acting all around. A lot of people complain that a lot of information is left out. That's how it always is when a book is made into a movie. The medium is totally different. What Cuaron has given us is more lush scenery with excellent visuals. The film is grainier and darker and the special effects are much more exciting. Personally, I'm glad that Chris Columbus has taken a step back from directing PoA and GoF. This will give each successive HP movie its own distinct feel and ambiance. "
822,,Much better than the first two.,WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!
823,6,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!,"This is hard to post this, but I'm disappointed with the third film. Oh, don't get me wrong, the style, the acting, the mood, the intensity and visauls... all were simply awesome, best yet in fact! I was even able to get past some of the major discontinuities. "
824,10,"Too fast, Too cut, Too short","Okay, so I go along to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to enjoy seeing my favourite book of the HP series put on the big screen. The film is excellent, of course, but there is one major problem with it, well, actually two: David Thewlis and Gary Oldman. These two excellent actors stole the whole film. No sooner than Remus J Lupin teaches his class to tackle the Boggart, I was aching to see more of his antics ( as we obviously do in the book ). But when Sirius and Remus take the stage together - my God what chemistry. It could have gone on forever and would have if the scene hadn't been reduced so much ( which I'm angry about by the way >:  ). And of course throw Alan Rickman into the mix and it actually becomes heaven. Roll on Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. I want the talented Gary and David back on screen! :)"
825,10,David Thewlis and Gary Oldman stole the movie.,"So . . . where to begin? Honestly, I think this is the hardest review I've ever written. It is now two hours after the curtain closed on my first viewing of the most recent entry in the Harry Potter film franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"". Numerous thoughts are rushing through my head, some contradictory. I don't think I have yet grasped the full impact of the movie on me, but hopefully, I will know by the time I'm finished writing."
826,9,"Wildly entertaining, totally fun, very dark and enthralling. Like a great ride at an amusement park . . . I wouldn't mind doing it over again.","After seeing the net flooded with Harry Potter fanfiction I can honestly say that the stories Rowling writes seem like nothing BUT fan-fiction. (Perhaps she plays too much fluffy dungeons and dragons) Harry Potter and the Plot of Holes perhaps.  A couple neat innovations and the filmmaking was good but the story and characters are barely watchable with the exception of David Thewlis who absolutely shines as Lupis. He seemd to be the only one given any meaty acting things to do. But when he's not there, there's little else of interest apart from the CGI creatures. (The Grim is probably the best of these)"
827,3,Fanfiction at best,"Maybe I am right out to lunch but did anyone else catch an idea that Lupin and Sirius were more than friends? They seemed very close (that was a really tight hug when they first saw each other again) and the comment about ""did you take your potion today"" sounded very much like an old couple where one person asks the spouse if they took their blood pressure pills today. Also when Snape burst in and said they were quarreling like an old married couple... And lets not forget that Lupin was leaving conveniently when Sirius was on the run. Who else could have told Sirius that Harry's broom got trashed so he would send a new one with a Buckbeak feather?  Why would Sirius care about quidditch? Only a person close to Harry like his teacher would have known how much he loved the game. {and I am SO not getting into the scene where Lupin is packing because ""parents wouldn't want someone like me teaching their kids--so so SO not going there, nice substitution of the werewolf allegory}I'm not trying to get dirty minded about this, it just seemed to me like they were close. I have to admit I haven't read the book yet but I will."
828,9,Relationship between Lupin and Sirius,"Like many Potter fans, I felt that after number two much magic was lost in the series. However, JK Rowlings ever increasingly better plot lines make up what the movie lacks. This was one of my favorite books, so despite a lot quirky things added(hem hem, shrunken heads anyone??), I still found ways to enjoy this movie."
829,8,One of my favorite books...not my favorite movie.,"Alfonso Cuaròn's astounding direction, John Williams' score (not only the best one in the Harry Potter film series but also at the very least one of the composer's finest), Stuart Craig's unparalleled production design, the visual and special effects that still hold up two decades later, the beautiful cinematography and the actors' performances (even the kids' acting got noticeably better from 'Chamber of Secrets'); simply put, this is a masterpiece, and sooner or later even the ones that are still complaining about the story of the marauders being cut and the little changes made by Cuaròn and writer Steve Kloves (at one point you'll have to understand that book to film cannot be a 1:1 translation) will see what an incredible film this truly is. Also, to the picky ones who may have never seen a Harry Potter film or may have abandoned the saga before the third year at Hogwarts, please watch and listen and feel this one, you won't regret it (plus, thanks to Cuaròn's and Kloves' cleverness and ""show not tell"" tricks, and obviously to the story from the book itself, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' can be seen even without having basically any knowledge of the previous entries in the series or having read the books; and hopefully this peculiarity will help the film in the future to stand out as the cult it should already be)."
830,10,It gets even better with time,"Loved th first two, but found that they included just too much of the books. It just shows how a film can become a bit boring if you try and include everything (even though I loved every part of the book)."
831,10,Great! Loved it!,"The third year of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has begun. This year, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who was accused by the Potter's parents murder, has scape from Azkaban Prison - until then considered as leakproof - and now, everything indicates that he's looking for Harry to finish what he had no opportunity to do."
832,8,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (UK/USA, 2004)",The reason I am saying this is because i couldn't believe how crappy Harry Potter 3 was.The movie was too rushed.Here's 10 reasons why i hated Number 3.
833,5,Wasn't sad to see Alfonso Cuaron not do Number 4.,"This movie is the worst of all so far, I didn't finish the last 30 minutes because the storyline is bad."
834,4,storyline is random and confusing,NO SPOILERS
835,8,"Great Book, Good Movie","Hey there's one thing to know about harry potter. like lord of the rings you love him or hate him! Me I love him so come to this with a prejudiced view point lol! Firstly thought azkaban was the weakest of the three on first viewing but after a third look found it to be the strongest in terms of character development and atmosphere. also found it to be the best in terms of real experiences and dilemmas in fact how many of us haven't been through similar experiences albeit of a more physical pattern! Harry just keeps getting better and better as befits the books and hermione is a torch bearer for young girls every where. elsewhere the standard of acting is par excellence, for a fantasy film of course, and the manner in this is maintained harbors well for the sequel!"
836,,the best yet,"I love the Harry Potter books a lot, they're really fun to read and have some good suspenseful moments (except for the end of Book Five, which only really evoked anger. Thank God for Fred and George) and great images that you can think of in your mind. Are the books the best thing ever written? No. Not even close, but they're still great. And my favorite one so far (waiting in anticipation for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and whatever Book Seven will be) is Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. Don't get me wrong, the first two were great, but Book Three took the cake."
837,10,"Excellent Film, Very Well Done by Cuaron (Maybe Some Spoilers)","This movie seemed to go by way too fast. There were some great moments in this film that could have been so much better had they just gone a little slower. It's not like anyone would have fallen asleep during it. Anyway, that was my big complaint. It went too fast in some parts. Below is some of the good and the bad..."
838,,Not sure whether I liked it or not,"hp 3 is the best book in the series, and the movie does not fail to please. it is the best movie thus far, although i believe that the fourth movie will be much better. first: the good. the good things about HP: POA is that the acting is excellent. dan radcliffe is one of the best young actors around, as is emma watson, who is turning into a very pretty young girl, and tom felton is a great actor as a baddie here. the chemistry between the big three (radcliffe, grint, watson) is fantastic. they look like they're the best of friends in real life, and they probably are. Now the bad: this movie is too short. alfonso cuaron destroyed the purpose of the book, altered happenings in the movie or moved the events to different points than they were in the movie. this is the only fault i have of this movie. it's a great one. 9/10 a sure cliffhanger till the end."
839,,oodles of fun,"'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' opens with the young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), under the covers of his bed, doing what most mischievous 13-year-old boys have done at some point or another in the dead of night (Reading! Sheesh!). We're amused to see that Harry's Uncle Vernon is too stupid to catch him (as the villain always is), and so the film begins!"
840,10,"A bit rough around the edges, but it's still better than the other two","Give Alfonso Cuarón some decent material and he could be a major director. The chief pleasure to be derived from the new Harry Potter is his assured handling of the camera. Often the scenes are single shots: the movement is achieved by panning in and out, including different things in the frame. Harry loses consciousness a lot in this instalment. Cuarón fixes on irises  where a pinpoint in blackness widens into a full image - as the best way to communicate his coming to. The device is used repeatedly: the scenes unfold like the turning pages of a fairy tale. The colour too is great. The images are bleached white or yellow, like the pages of an aged storybook. This visual finesse got me excited all on its own: it was such a relief after Harry's previous, lumbering outings."
841,,Cuaron,Spoilers within.
842,,Alakazam,"Hey there. I've read all of the current Harry Potter books, and being in my late 50s didn't spoil the fun for me one bit. In fact I have a huge crush on Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Oh, I love Harry too, Daniel is a real cutey but, I feel so much for the Weasleys, all of them, because of how the horribleMalfoys treat all. It was like when I was a little girl and watched ""Peter Pan"" on TV for the first time, it was a play, and Mary Martin played Peter. That didn't matter, it was the adventure of it all that got me into wanting to read everything and anything I could on those sorts of adventures. Anything that took you away from everyday reality and lead you into another world! I never thought that I would actually get hooked on the Harry Potter books, but a young boy that I was baby-sitting for had gotten the book I think it was ""The Goblet of Fire"", for a Christmas present, and left it over my house for me to read. After I was through, I was thoroughly hooked. I had a sad feeling that the production wouldn't, no, couldn't be as magical as the books were. I thank heaven that I was wrong! To me it is right up there with the thrilling ""Matrix"" series. Yes, I say honestly that I love the Harry Potter movies, and I have seen them all to date, just as much as I loved, ""The Jungle Book"", the ""Star Trek"" series and the movies, the ""Star Wars"" movies, ""Blade Runner"", The TV series, ""Farscape"", ""The X-Files"", ""Star-Gate"", the movie and the series! I could go on and on, 'cause I am a SciFi fanatic! I even loved ""A Wrinkle in Time"", and if you haven't read that book, I really think that you should!!! You wouldn't be sorry! I loved Gary Oldman in Bram Stoker's Dracula, of course, but even more, I loved him in ""The Fifth Element""!!! Zorg was a fantastic character for him to play, and he played him to the hilt! I watch any movie that he is in, when it comes on TV, (He is one of my favorite actors, next to Mickey Rourke, you know)? I also love Jason Isaacs in his part, Malfoy, he is so sleazy, and mean. So different than he was as Mr. Darling and so good as Captain Hook! Or in Resident Evil, which are the only other parts I remember him in! Oh my daughter, Cherokee just told me he was in Elektra!!! Another great movie. I loved Richard Harris as Dumbledore, I'll miss him. I do think that Michael Gambon is doing a wonderful job replacing him. Many people I talked to didn't know the difference, but then they aren't videophiles, like my three children and I am!!! Anyway, I just wanted to give ""Kudos"" to the entire cast of all of the Harry Potter movies!!! You've made me so happy to be able to ""get away from it all"" in your cinema world. Thanks J.K. Rowling for the books. True gifts at ten times the price!!!"
843,10,Harry Potter!!!!!,Rating:8.5/10
844,,Better than the first two technically,"Sadly Chris Columbus stopped with the directing of the ""Harry Potter"" movies after ""The Chamber of Secrets"". In my opinion, he was by far the best director of the saga. He was replaced by Alfonso Cuarón, who, I think so, wasn't a well known director at that point. What you can say from the first seconds on is that his style of adaptating ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is completely different than Columbus did it."
845,9,"Completely Different Style Than The First Two, But Still Great","This movie is not as good as Chamber of Secrets, but better than The Philosopher's Stone. Everybody says that this is the marking point for when the Harry Potter films get dark. But in my opinion, the fourth one is when it gets darker."
846,6,A good movie.,"I must say, I cannot understand those who say this one is the best of the Harry Potters. To me, it is clearly my least favorite. I don't understand, really, how anyone can want *less*. And this is less in every way."
847,7,Not the best of the series,"After a lovely hour queuing together with three year olds on sugar high,"
848,6,"It's meaner, it's darker...but is it better?- SPOILERS","So Columbus and Kloves were accused of being too faithful to the books for the first two movies.  Cuaron and Kloves won't be getting that accusation this time round.  Not having any respect for the book whatsoever, on the other hand... Or rather, for the characters.  Granted, this is something that can only anger book fans, but when Hermione Granger is suddenly a superwoman and Ron Weasley is suddenly a scaredy-cat, beyound, as far as I can tell, the needs of the change of medium, one starts to suspect laziness.  But most of this is their lines, i.e. Kloves. Cuaron actually does a pretty good with the directing.  But Kloves has thrown in some horrible dialogue(mostly to Dumbledore) that his direction doesn't keep the audience from going, ""Huh?""  Scenes are put into place poorly(most jarring example probably being The Three Broomsticks scene), the plot rushes at fever-pace without trying to figure itself out, one desperately needed explanation that could have easily been arranged to fill all of two minutes of running time does not manifest. Unfortunately, Kloves wrote Goblet of Fire too.  Please, please replace him before he butchers Order of the Pheonix!"
849,,Kloves needs to be replaced!,"It was good but had a horrible ending. I really get upset when authors use a timewarp to go back and fix mistakes, it cheats the audience. The only time that Time Travel should be used as a plot device is when the main story is about time travel. Too many times do major movies and tv shows use this plot device to fix problems within the plot. Even superman, star trek, andromeda, and other popular movies and tv shows use it. Lame. The first movie was better. This one is worth seeing though, but I'm waiting for the next one. Hopefully the plot will be better........."
850,,good but horrible ending....,"Of All the Harry Potter movies this is by far the most enjoyable. I am not a big fan of Harry Potter but this is a film that kept me entertained for the whole film ...... Something that is hard for movies to do despite dragging on in some parts. to me the first two Harry potter films were more of a Seven year old movie and despite minor moments that i found entertaining, that only made up for 15-25 minutes of the movie.And an honorable mention has to go to The introduction of Sirius Black who i hoped would get more screen time in the goblet of fire (Luckily we got to see him again in Order of the Pheonix)overall I give this movie an 8 as it is the perfect blend of humor maturity and darkness and it is regarded as the film the first two should have been (At least the last four were OK!!)"
851,8,Perfect blend of darkness and Humour ..... for some,"Azkaban was so good I watched it twice. Everything came together so well in this movie. First off, Cuaron directed his ass off. It's not easy to pull off time travel in film and he did so excellently. Also it was nice seeing a change of pace from the first 2. Where Harry Ron and Hermoine are changing from little kids into adolescence, the themes grow darker and more mature."
852,9,The ones that love us never really leave us,"When I saw previews calling PoA one of the ""best films of all time"", I was worried. Since then, I've seen the movie twice, and could easily go a third."
853,7,Absolutely fantastic. But not 100% faithful to the book.,"The first two HP films are children's fairytales, but part three is a dark,"
854,,Shockingly different...,"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one here who feels that this 3rd installment really bites. Like most fans, we bought tickets long in advance and saw a late night screening to bypass screaming and disruptive children and the audience was quite mature so these were die-hard adult fans here. I should have taken my cue and known in advance that this would disappoint. Taking the escalator up to the third floor of the megaplex, I saw nothing but long, withdrawn silent faces coming down the escalator on the opposite side. It went downhill from there. Granted, the effects were spectacular, the hybrid animal creatures, the transformations etc. etc. etc. Top notch but with an unlimited budget, you can do that and nothing less should be expected or accepted at this stage of the game. What was the serious flaw in this film was the sense of continuity and the sense of flow. Truthfully, there was no flow at all but rather a series of choppy transitions from scene to scene and story point to story point. It did not feel at all like you were flowing along with the story. Rather, it felt like there was a stacatto sense of rhythm and you were being jerked around. Many, many points in the books were completely lost and I agree with another reviewer that if this is the way the film franchise is going, perhaps in the future ""Loosely based on the book..."" should be prominently advertised. Purists of the books will be disappointed and mostly anyone who likes Harry Potter Anything will most likely be the biggest fans."
855,,An utter and thorough disappointment,"I wasn't really a Harry Potter fan going into this film, but a friend convinced me to go, and I am sure glad she did!"
856,,Captured by Potter Magic,"The Prisoner of Azkaban draws quite a different line than the Chamber of Secrets or the Philosopher's Stone. Most of it is summed up in the tag-line 'something wicked this way comes.' The first two installments were pretty light, but relatively long, viewing, introducing you to the world of Harry Potter and its delightful characters and their antagonists. But as Harry grows older, the world grows darker. When Harry's third year at Hogwarts dawns, the news is all aplomb with news of the recently escaped Sirius Black, a supporter of Lord Voldemort and murderer of many people, and for some reason is coming after Harry. Hogwarts, because of this danger, is being protected by evil shrouded Dementors, who guard the wizard prison Azkaban. They affect Harry especially, but he is helped along by his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), along with his new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, the shabby looking but very nice Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) As the story progresses, Harry learns just why Sirius is coming for him, and in a magnificent intricate climax, he learns the truth."
857,10,Something Wicked This Way Comes...,"I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series, but am disappointed in the Prisoner of Azkaban film. There was too much of the book left out and too much silly extra's put in. What was the deal with the bird flying into the whomping willow? To me the new Dumbledor is a disappointment. They need to clean up his nails and he needs to act a tad bit more in touch with reality. I think it would be better if the actor that replaced Richard Harris acted more like he did in the two previous films, The Sorcerer's Stone, and The Chambers of Secrets. I adore the whole cast but am disappointed in the new director and the direction he took. I feel Chris Columbus did a better job."
858,,Not as good,What a brilliant move to have Cuaron direct this movie!
859,,Best of them all!,"When Harry and Sirius Black are being attacked by the Dementors.....why does it look like a glowing deer that saves them....I Just don't get it.....also, when Peter Pettigrew is transformed from being a rat he is fully clothed...However, when he turns back into a rat, the clothes remain. I know these are trivial issues...but that glowing deer thing!!! What is going on there?"
860,7,Why does Harry Potter appear to be a glowing deer????,"Spoilers. The 'new look' of Hogwarts' is great, especially liked Lupin's study and the huge gothic doors - most of the FX were good but some annoying -  felt like taking my quidditch broom to the bulbous head of the Dementor on the train, but the scene where they swirl down to do in HP and SB was totally cool. I didn't think the cgi on the dog and werewolf characters was as good as that on Dobby in HP 2. The aim of this movie was to keep true to the book, which succeeds at the expense of a tightly written screenplay. The young actors except for Rupert Grint are still quite wooden but then I suppose so is a lot of the dialogue in the book. Just the same I think fans of the book and fans of good movies will like this one."
861,,good show,"In the scene where Professor Lupin is instructing the students on repelling the Bogget (shape shifter), its Harry Potter's turn to cast the ridiculous spell. The Bogget's power lies in the ability to assume the shape of the most feared object of the person's mind. Since Harry's fear is the Dementor, the Bogget changed into a Dementor. Harry is scared and can't throw the ridiculous spell, so prof Lupin stands in front of Harry. In doing so, he is now the focus of the Bogget and the fear that the professor is keeping deep inside is transformed by the Bogget. The fear? A full moon. Why? Because Professor Lupin is a Werewolf. You see this full moon picture again in the last part of the movie when the Professor, Harry, Sirus Black and crew are together at night on the hill. The full moon shines through the clouds and the Professor does his wolf thing."
862,,SPOILER--after seeing the movie a few times the little things make sense,this is a movie. its not a visual synopsis of the book. i've seen all three and i'm OLD. and the thing people have to remember is that movies have to be entities of their own. i have never seen a film yet based on a book that was entirely and perfectly representative of it.
863,,give me a break people,"first of all i'm not at all a potter fan, never was but to say this movie is bad, cause its not exactly like the third book is utter nonsense. i didn't read the 3 book but never the less i know what its about i know where and about whom... thats all i need to know."
864,9,gets better with every time i see it,"I've seen it yesterday, and I thought the movie was damn good. I can understand some of the fans are disappointed. Then again, you can't expect the movie to be just like the book. Yes some parts are missing but if you want to literally translate the book into a movie it would take 6 hours. I think a lot of fans don't understand you have to make changes to the book to make a good movie."
865,9,"Didn't read the book, loved the movie.","I thought that the movie would be good! But it was really boring. They're wrecking the story and Mr Cauron made it worser. I am a great fan of the books! I thought that Sir Ian McKellen would be the best instead of Michael Gambon. Mr Gambon did worse. Mr Oldman was okay, but I thought that it'd have been a lot better if Mr. Mortensen or Mr. Bloom would have replaced him. Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Felton, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Devon Murray acted well, but the movie was bad. I only hope that Mike Newell, the director of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will make the movie a good one. The movie's spoiling the story. Chris Columbus was good. Mr. Cauron's not so good in directing. Watching this one is a total waste of time..."
866,5,not so bad...,"I thought that the movie would be good! But it was really boring. They're wrecking the story and Mr Cauron made it worser. I am a great fan of the books! I thought that Sir Ian McKellen would be the best instead of Michael Gambon. Mr Gambon did worse.

Mr. Cauron's not so good in directing."
867,5,not so bad...,"Harry, Hermione, and Ron are back. And better than ever. Alfonso Curon really surprised me with this peice of work that is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alot was cut, sadly, but that was only to help propel the story futher (I hope we get some kind of director's cut or  S**t load of deleted scenes on the DVD). The big three are at there best. That goes double for Dan and Emma, this is hands down their best preformances yet (Plus, Emma has never been so sexy). It is going to take alot for Any other film this year to impress me. I can't wait for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter is here to stay."
868,10,The Best Movie of 2004,"I guess I shouldn't have gone into the movie with such high hopes. This was my favorite book of the series, and I was hoping it would be the best movie of the three. It sucked. I went in excited that I would get to see my favorite parts of the book acted out, but I was wrong. Apparently, Cuaron didn't even read the book before directing this movie. I was very disappointed. Not only did the story not follow the book (too many changes to really call it the same thing), but the directing was horrible. Some of the most climactic moments in the book were some of the most boring in the movie. It was slaughtered!! "
869,,"Harry Potter fans, stay away!!","I was kind of skeptical after the director for the first two HP's left, and didn't think this movie would be as good as the others. I was wrong. This movie doesn't feel like a boring re-telling of the book, but it envisions all that JK Rowling has come to write in her books, lots of imagination and pure action."
870,,More action packed then the first two!,"The 5 stars are purely for the director's ""effort"" to give this movie a more ""personal"" feeling. Although much of that effort turned out badly, but it is still a Harry Potter movie and has its magic... I guess a single star is a little too harsh."
871,5,Total disgrace to the book.,"This is the worst of the 3 current Harry Potter movies. The new director has completely changed the scene of the movie. The castle grounds as well as the castle have been reconstructed. Since when is there a hill on the way to Hagrid's Hut? Also, this movie is horrible when it comes to following the book. The ending scene was terribly messed up. Believe me, I have read the book over 6 times, I should know. The quidditch game is in the wrong time period; and since when do the students wear zip-up hoodies and rainbow belts? That is wrong. In the book they wear sweaters and pants, no flare jeans or anything like that. Please bring back Chris Columbus. This new director screwed up the entire movie."
872,3,Five words: This is a bad movie.,"In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was in fact better than the first two movies. The Sorcerer Stone was not bad at all as it was putting the set for the characters. Lots of CGs, kind of a 'kid' movie with lots of ""oooh"" scenes like the Quidditch match or the Troll rampage."
873,8,Better than the first two...,All who have read the books have come to enjoy/love the Harry Potter series.
874,3,Where is the Magic?,"An edgier, darker, more mature Harry returns to Hogwarts School with his friends Hermione and Ron ready to take on yet another adventure in his world of wizardry. "
875,,The Best Book and the Best Movie....,"This movie is terrible, no wait, it's garbage. There is so much BS put in this movie, and the real stuff is removed! Harry and Professor Lupin don't walk around talking about stuff! They speak once in Lupin's office, then they have anti-dementor lessons! There is no toad choir! Harry doesn't even tell Lupin what his happiest memory is! And it's not even his mom! And the worst part in the whole movie, flying dementors, I mean come on!? That was the most stupid thing ever. Dementors glide an inch above the ground.. They just don't fly! I am extremely disappointed in this fake Harry Potter movie. They could have done so much with the material, but instead they say, here's Harry Potter, this is his year, love it. And oh, how could I forget Professor Trelawny? The just missed what her character is about completely. Really disappointing. I gave this movie a 1, and it barely deserves that. The actors are alright, but the script and directing is terrible, just awful. I can understand that people like the movie if they haven't read the book, but seriously, do read the book. It's just so much better.Can't they just stick to what's in the book? Why add stuff? The books are loved for what they are.. Why ruin it? I'm just gonna stop, please don't see this movie, it's a pure waste of time. Read the book, enjoy a true piece of art."
876,1,A Complete Failure,"Anybody who has read the books will be able to tell you just how good the Prisoner of Azkaban was, and how good the movie really should have been. POA is by far my favorite of the five books that have been so far released and to say I was excited to watch this movie doesn't even come close. This was the first of the Potter movies that I went to see on the big screen and although I did enjoy the amount of information and aspects that made the book so good were sadly missing from this adaptation. Add the fact that due to a new director the grounds were completely changed and you find more reasons for me being upset at Alfonso Cuaron. Richard Harris being replaced didn't help either but that couldn't be changed unfortunately. Harris was the best person for the job and although Gambon did an almighty job in the role there really was no way to replace the man who many people will now see as the face of Albus Dumbeldore."
877,7,Harry 3 the rough version,"I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter. I probably have the books memorized. And ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favorite of the books. So I was well psyched for the movie. And it didn't disappoint. For the most part. The actual cinematography was so much cleaner and better than the first two films. The visual effects were also much tighter and more believable. Sirius as Snuffles was so well done, with a nice tip of the hat to ""The Nothing"" from ""The Neverending Story."" Lupin as a werewolf was pretty cool, not because it was necessarily well done, but because he was clearly a werewolf and not a regular wolf or dog. The new look of the Hogwarts castle and grounds was really more with the mood of the books, if not consistent with the other movies. My main complaints are that the director (Alfonso Cuaron) had never even read the books before being approached about directing ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", so he didn't have any investment in the series or any passion for it. Also, he took a lot of the fun and humor out of the story and kept in things that were unnecessary or lingered too long on certain subjects. The scene where Malfoy, Crab, and Goyle dress as a dementor to scare Harry is one of the most hilarious parts of the book, and I was incredibly disappointed about its disclusion. Finally, why why, oh why, did they change Lupin's relationship from being best friends with Harry's dad to Harry's mom. Lupin's friendship with James Potter, and thus with Sirius and Wormtail is MASSIVELY important to ""The Order of the Pheonix"" and it is just stupid and confusing that the relationship was changed. "
878,7,Fabulous Filming Amidst the Fatal Flubs,the third installment of harry potter franchise as the kids grow older into their teenage hood i would have to say that this film has some good solid filmaking to the point where it is so solid that when i watch it it makes me tear in proudness of the good work that is put into this film Alfonso Caron the director is one of the directors to choose from if u want a good movie. And again the leading actors are once again solid acting as teenagers who play it well. the special and visual effects are not great but its passable for this type of solid filmaking. in my opinion and reaction of the film is that its a film with great solidness and great acting that this movie should be looked at as examples from other directors i would give this movie a low B+ to a high A-
879,9,a film that has very good solid filmaking,"I just recently watched HP and the Prisoner again this past week, after finishing the latest book. I was struck by how wonderfully magical the filming of this instalment has been created with fade in's (don't see many of those anymore), hilarious bridging scenes with the Whomping Willow, and the clock / time theme throughout. This HP movie has a vivid sense of humour playing against the rapid plot, and a screenplay that does a brilliant job of pulling together all the critical elements of Rowling's story. It's a daunting task to recreate something that has played through so many people's imaginations, but Prisoner has done a fantastic job."
880,10,Visual magic and excitement,"The third Harry Potter adaptation is rather darker and more brooding than the previous ones, although the plot is less convoluted. A number of episodes from the book have been deleted, enabling the director to concentrate upon the basic narrative. The young stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have certainly found their feet, each giving a polished performance far in advance of their previous efforts. The real coup of this film is, however, the supporting cast, if one can describe the superb actors Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall and Alan Rickman in such inadequate terms. Their portrayals are, to a man, completely convincing. Of the new members of Hogwarts staff, only Michael Gambon doesn't perhaps quite hit the mark, lacking the mystic air of his predecessor. Emma Thompson is spot-on with other celebrity character-actor cameos effectively inserted. The only drawback is that the unrelenting bad weather at Hogwarts will do little for our tourist trade!"
881,8,A darker Potter,"This is my favorite one in the Harry Potter series. Now that he's aged more, you can take this movie seriously."
882,10,The best in the series so far,THE prisoner OF AZKABAN by Alfonso Cuaron.
883,10,The prisoner,Obviously one of the best Harry<br /><br />Potter films there is and much more darker then the other 2
884,8,good movie,"I had a few qualms with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Mostly, i thought, it was too disconnected and choppy. They just keep throwing everything at you. Second, is there are a few things they did not put enough emphesis on. For example, how much Snape really hates Harry and Sirius. I also though the film was a bit hard to follow (if you haven't read the books). Despite all the misdirections the movie took, I thought it was very entertaining and well made. It went through at a fast pace, had great acting, and beautiful scenery. I thought Gary Oldman's performance was especially well done. As compared to the previous Harry Potter films, it is very different, but in a good way."
885,,Alright,very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.
886,10,perfect movie my favorite,"Okay. I'm gonna start by saying that I am a big fan of the Harry Potter film series. I have not yet read the books, but I will be getting around to it. I enjoyed Philosopher's Stone, and Chamber Of Secrets even more, and deeply enjoyed Prisoner Of Azkaban. "
887,,"Ups and downs, but let's try to be rational here (SPOILERS AHEAD)",The third movie was very good.
888,,Are you a fan of the book?,"*** The review assumes familiarity with the Harry Potter canon *** This isn't the perfect movie by any means. I'll grant that. For one, I'd definitely have liked more about Marauders and a much better clarification of how they were all related to Harry, especially Lupin. (This would've explained so much, like how Lupin could read the map while Snape couldn't and the significance of the stag patronus.) This is also the movie that deviates significantly (for the first time; the earlier two were rather slavish adaptations) from the book. But the differences are what I cherished the most. The whole time turner sequence is quite brilliant IMHO, cheesy but brilliant. There's absolutely no way Rowling could have written in all the visual flourishes and Kloves and Cuaron take full advantage of the possibilities presented with the whole time turner sequence. Sure it's sort of deus ex machina but that's the way it was written in the book and they couldn't possibly alter it entirely. For one, Harry, Ron and Hermoine aren't nearly quite magically or emotionally ready to do the whole thing right in the first go. So, while the deus ex machina weakens the whole plot a bit, this is about the best movie one can come up with, within the plot. Another small distraction is the very first scene when Harry obviously performs magic during summer, which he's not allowed to do. (And it gets stated explicitly multiple times in the movie!) That was a fairly major goof."
889,8,The best Harry Potter movie to date!,"Seems like there are already two camps forming around this movie; the people who like the changes, and the ones who end up missing Columbus. I, for one, do not approve of all of the things Alfonso Cuaron has done but I still think it's a good movie."
890,9,Interesting...,"This movie was outstanding! I absolutely loved it. I recommend it to anyone who is in for an exciting hilarious film, but also has enough time to spare, because it is nearly 3 hours, but it well worth the time. I will have to say that the book is better, because the movie left out many things (such as who actually made the mauanders map and other things), but the director did ant excellent job without making it like 10 hours long."
891,9,"Outstanding....If you thought the first 2 were good then you Have to see this one, it is incredibly good. I loved it!!!","As a fan of the book I was a little disappointed with Prisoner of Azkaban. I felt it was too rushed. Lots of parts from the book which I liked were not there in the movie, and I was surprised not to see any Quidditch matches, the year Gryffindor wins the cup! I know its tough to adapt the book into a movie and please everybody.But even the pre climax sequence in the Shrieking Shack, was cut in half as compared to the book, which was almost three chapters long. Anyway, the performances were nearby excellent. Daniel and Rupert look and act their parts well. Emma was fantastic! Emma has a lot of screen time in this film as compared to the first two films, and she does full justice to the character Hermione. Of the adult actors, all were brilliant, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis to name a few. The music score is excellent, the visuals are breathtaking, and the special effects are really good. I give it 8.5/10."
892,,Little Disappointing,I can't believe how good this film is. I have always thought Goblet of Fire was the best of the series. But today that title has officially gone to Prisoner of Azkaban.
893,10,Childhood Revisited,"The only thing I hated about this movie was how fast it went. I can understand them rushing the film till we get inside the Shrieking Shack. However, when Lupin and Black are explaining everything they needed to slow down. It was like bang, bang, bang Sirius is innocent. How did that happened ? Now I loved everything else. Yes , I'm looking forward to the next one. I wonder if Ron and Hermione are going to get together. I'm also wondering if something is going to happened between Harry and Jenny. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I wonder what Percy would do if Harry and Jenny got engaged. I love to see his face. Is it true that someone will die in book six and seven ?"
894,5,O .k .,"Alfonso Cuarón deu a este filme uma personalidade, sendo o melhor filme da Saga. Do início ao fim você fica preso a narrativa, sem barrigas ou cenas que não desenvolvem o filme. Parabéns!"
895,8,O Melhor filme da Saga!!!,(No spoilers review)
896,9,New Director Invigorates the Potter Series.,"Reviewing in 2020 , Harry Potter third magical outing is very different from first two films which contains more as drama magical mystery movie. There has some controversial issues for this movie i have heard before but myself realize the fans can be satisfied at the end of the film. Overall it's slowly paced engaging Young Potter's drama in his third year with some horrific visuals and excellence of Young Hermione survive to great film."
897,7,Azkaban's Prisoner almost ruined Harry Potter's magic.,"This is the best movie from all the Harry Potter series. Alfonso Cuaron captured the magic and so many little details from the book perfectly. When I miss Harry Potter, I always come back to this movie. I absolutely adore it! Although my favorite HP book is The Half Blood Prince, my favorite movie is this one! After this, the movies started going downhill."
898,10,After all this time this is still my favorite!,"Me and my kids have waited for this movie for a long time and when we seen it it was like seeing a whole different movie. everything can't make the movie but the movie should follow the book. The movie was chopped up, they left things out & add things that did not matter or was not in the book. they said that they would follow the book and they didn't. we did not like the movie at all it was poorly done but will buy the DVD, only because it is a set. Hope #4 is better. They will have to put some things form this movie in the next or you will not understand a thing. They have to work ever harder to make up for this mess. If they don't do better on the next movie they will start losing fans if they haven't already."
899,1,I did not like this movie at all,Missing Sirius. It turns out that Ron is also afraid of Snape's fluorescence flashing!
900,10,Azkaban,"Well, this movie may be the ""best"" movie of the Harry Potter movies, but it is the most untrue to the book. Sure in the 4th one the maze was all wrong, and in the 1st they left out trials before Harry gets to the stone. But in the 3rd, not only are some characters just portrayed incorrectly, the plot is twisted, and many things are not explained. For example, if you have not read the book, you don't understand anything about Sirius and why he really isn't guilty (my brother was super confused for example). Also there was barely any quidditch, quidditch is one of the most important aspects in the book. On that note, Sirius was supposed to send Harry his fire bolt in the middle of the book, and there was a big conflict about if the broom is bewitched. Also, it says specifically in the book that the students at Hogwarts don't know how to dress in the ""current styles"" because they only wear their robes, that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie. Also the dementors are wrong, they don't fly, they float, the kiss was not them attacking you and pulling your face off, they was supposed to be huge lips somewhere, i didn't see any. Also i cant seem to decide whether Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are good actors or not, in the 4th they are fine, no overacting or anything, but in the 3rd, i don't know what to think, for example, when Harry finds out about SIrius and his parents, he does some sort of cry thing, that looks like he is having an asthma attack. Also, this isn't really any ones fault, but Emma Watson is way too gorgeous for her character, i mean, Hermione is supposed to have bushy hair and buck teeth, Emma Watson has perfect teeth and amazing hair. The movie was disappointing, when you have a Harry Potter marathon, watch 1, 2, and 4. because the only reason you should watch 3 is when you are in a ""omg this movie is wrong"" mood, and want to point out everything incorrect in the movie."
901,3,oh no,"Its been more than a year since I read the book that was made into this film, so I can't count point by point whether this film followed the book exactly. That being said, the narrative was beautifully done and conveyed the full impact of the story to the screen. "
902,,Summary from the premiere in Germany,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan, have read all the books and enjoyed them immensely. The first 2 films captured the adventure and mood that J.K.Rowling incorporated into the books. They were exciting and full of mystery and intrigue."
903,3,Prisoner of Azkaban,"Purists will be muttering about the departures from the book (check out some of the other reviews); while no purist myself I am puzzled about one or two of the changes in the setting and direction. What has not been mentioned is the location of Hagrids cottage. It has suddenly jumped from being just outside the main gate of Hogwarts (and adjacent to the Haunted Forest) to a wooded valley and reached by a path down a stony hillside. I believe that the castle was also visible in the background on a hill top. What was the point of that, I wonder? I also found the whole film entirely lacking the feel of the first two. OK, new Director wanting to put his own stamp on the series, I can understand that, but the film has suffered. It compares badly (in my opinion) with the others - sadly, it was mostly dull with definitely a touch of the ""ho hum"" factor. Michael Gambon is a damn good actor - why was his character so low key? As it was, you are reminded that Richard Harris is dead and this is the replacement, instead of just presenting Dumbledore as a lead part. Sorry, but I can only give this a 5 out of 10"
904,5,Disappointing,"The film is made up by special effects and nothing else, it has hardly any story to it and poor acting, Alfonso even calls hogwarts hoerts in the interviews and has clearly never read the book as he wanted to put Buckbeak in a graveyard when clearly in the book is not correct, J K rowling must know that the film should be made with a limit to the special effects and not to waste time flying around castles and sucking Harrys face off with weird dementors that freeze things when they're just suppose to make it feel cold and drain the happiness out of you, Hogwarts castle also seems to have gained a clock tower which it shouldn't, overall i think this film is an insult to the book."
905,3,The film is nothing to the book,"I watched this again on HBO tonight, and am quite content to state that this is the best movie of its type since the Wizard of Oz."
906,10,The best of its type,Spoilers within.
907,,A Disappointment to Die-hards,I have seen this movie multiple times and I still enjoy it as much as I watched it for the first time. It has a lot of good scary moments which keeps it exciting. The film has a great plot too. If you love fantasy and mystery than this movie is definitely for you. You are able to understand it even if you haven't seen de first two movies yet. However the experience would be better if you watched those first. The film follows an amazing story which makes it one of my favorites.
908,9,extraordinary good,"hmmm, not much to say about this movie, I guess. I thought it was better than the first 2 movies. The acting was a lot better too, I really think you can see that the actors have grown during the movies. I've read all the books (until the 5th one) and I sometimes think somethings are left behind, which were quite important in the book. (I can't think of one at the moment, but I do know it is!) I really wonder what the next movies are gonna be like. I hope that they hury up with the books, before Harry, Ron and Harmoine are grown up and they have to find new actors, I think that would really be sad. I love prof. lupin btw! I've seen him as the bad guy in Dragonheart (God I hated him in that movie, spoiled little prince) But he's REALLY freakin' cool as a werewolf :D I like this one! Keep up the good work guys, now that you've got a good movie of Harry Potter, DON'T MESS IT UP AGAIN!!!"
909,,something wicked this way comes,"The story:  Harry Potter has returned to Hogwarts for his third year. However this year won't be all fun and games.  A convicted murderer and supposed supporter of You-Know-Who called Sirius Black has escaped the wizard prison of Azkaban and is on the loose, supposedly to hunt down Harry and take revenge.  As a result the mysterious Dementors, the wraith-like guards of Azkaban have been stationed at Hogwarts to look for Black and protect the students.  But that is only the beginning "
910,,"The pendulum swings the other way - Columbus tried to cram too much in, whereas Cuaron cuts too much out.","First off I should start by saying that if you are a die-hard anal-retentive fan of the books and you are expecting a page by page adaption sequentially than listen to an audio book because this is not what you are looking for. One thing I really enjoyed about this film in comparison to the other two is its new look and cinematography, it really captures the darkness of Rowlings book and I cannot wait to see what they will continue with in the future (the books only get darker). Cuaron is most definitely a stronger visual director and perhaps even a stronger transporter of the literary medium to film than Columbus was. He shows the wizarding world in a much more fun and colorful way than Columbus ever did and I sincerely hope that Cuaron stays on board for the upcoming films. He is excellent at showing lots of neat stuff going on around Harry that simply brings the world to life a lot more. He also brings key scenes that might have not been touched on very much in the books to exciting life, the knight bus sequence for instance was really a hoot and a lot of fun to watch."
911,10,Page by Page Adaption this is not...Great Fantasy Film it is...,"This latest Harry potter film is the first (and last) film to be directed by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron. He is also the films most striking (but by no means greatest) flaw. Being his big chance to break into Hollywood (and feeling the need to break out of Columbus' shadow) he overdoes the directing of this film so dramatically that you at times feel you are watching the world's mos expensive student film. One minute into the film he brings in the Dogma 95 -style hand-held camera. And throughout the film he sticks in shrunken heads (yes Alfonso, we know you are from Central America, but you ARE aware that this takes place in Britain aren't you?). THREE times we are treated to swooping shots of birds flying though the air, leaves falling off the trees etc. Like Potter himself, it felt like Cuaron was an eager adolescent trying to show off what he could do. On top of that, the architecture of Hogwarts itself was filled with freudian symbolism. Sure. In an adult movie this would be great - Cuaron should do more of those. But this is completely out of tone with the rest of the Harry Potter universe. A good (professionalistic) director knows his genre and sticks to it. This felt a bit like the Tom and Jerry episodes from the 70's where they ruined it with all kinds of modernistic, artsy-fartsy details. For all his technical show-offing, Cuaron fails to ever bring genuine suspense to the story. He simply makes it a bit more depressing and feels satisfied with that."
912,,Art-house Potter,"Anyway, I felt that from this movie onwards there was a lot missing. Richard Harris played Dumbledore as a very wise, fair and most importantly kind old man. Gambon plays him with an Ulster accent like that of Ian Paisley. It sounds abrupt, preaching and everything but friendly. The Dawn French lines made me cringe, and the Granger girl seemed to become the main protagonist. There seems a lot of cost cutting like, ""Don't bother going to the Alley to get your books because I've conveniently got them all for you"" and let's just cut out Platform 9 and 3/4 and jump straight to the train chugging along with everyone aboard. Many scenes are drawn out to a yawn inducing length which sacrifices quality for quantity."
913,5,Be Prepared (Very Minor Spoiler),"I used to be one of those stubborn people who wasn't going to read the Harry Potter series books. However, after seeing the first movie (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), I was hooked! I read everything Harry Potter I could get my hands on. At that time, only four books had been released and the third (Prisoner of Azkaban) was my hands-down favorite. It had so much intrigue and plot development, I couldn't wait to see it portrayed on screen!"
914,1,Utterly Disappointing,"The movie didn't follow the book as closely this time around, but the film itself was great. I loved the casting and the special effects were wonderful. Those dementors were CREEPY! I wouldn't want to come up on one of them in a dark alley. Gary Oldman was brilliant and I really liked David Thewlis. I was more neutral on Michael Gambon, but Richard Harris left big shoes to fill. I will be curious to see how he tackles Goblet of Fire. The kids are really becoming quite gifted actors and are growing up so quickly. What a difference between the three movies. The cinematography was very unique in this one and there was much more of a feel to the castle. I loved the intro scenes with the Dursley's and the scenes with Ron and Hermione arguing about Scabbers and Crookshanks..."
915,10,Great entertainment,"I can say i enjoyed this movie but i can't say it was a fabulous adaption of the book. I mean they took out so many important scenes that would be useful in the later movies, aside from that the acting was terrific Dan, Emma, Rupert, Robbie, tom and etc all played there roles perfectly. And Professor Mcgonnagal played by Maggie smith was once again brilliant, and Gary old man's performance as Sirius Black was my favorite. David Thewlis gave a terrific performance as Professor Lupin, and the visual effects were great and my favorite was Buckbeak he was so beautiful i wish i could just take him home. A downfall was the director Alfonso Cuaron now i'm not being mean i don't think he is a bad director but he was bad director at making a harry potter movie. And what was with tom the barkeeper he turned all goofy and weird, and even though tom felton did a great performance as Malfoy his character was sissy than ever...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a fairly good entertaining movie but it was missing stuff the other two potter movie's had."
916,7,fairly entertaining...,"I used to think that Harry Potter' couldn't be taken seriously. I thought that only inexperienced children could read and love these books. I had no doubt about it until last summer I saw my own 10-year-old niece intently reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'. I was amazed as she had never read a book on her own will. `Ok then' I said to myself, `I must have my own opinion'. So when everybody went to sleep I took the book from the table, went to my room and started reading."
917,8,Something Wicked This Way Came!,Finally! A film with only ten minutes or so of Quidditch! It's a miracle. (Spoilers...I think)
918,,Halleluiah!,First of all I have to say that I love the books and I'm really fond of the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like the previous Harry Potter movies at all because the acting was just so bad. And it hasn't improved much.
919,5,Better than predecessors but still not what I'd expected.,"I was really disappointed with this outing, though I realize I may be prejudiced because this was my favorite book of the series. I knew that having a new director would give a different look, I just don't think it was necessarily a good thing. There were some major things left out that could be confusing to anyone not familiar with the books. For instance in regards to the marauders map...they never explain just who Prongs, Wormtail, Padfoot or Mooney are. There may be something wrong that I know this at my age without having to reference the book...but I love these stories and its disappointing to see them tweeked on the big screen. There is also Harry's patronis taking the shape of a stag...that is never explained either. Further they didn't explain a lot about what an animagious is. Like I said, I know the books so well...maybe that is why I didn't care as much about this rendition. See the movie......but please....read the books! They are so much fun!!!!!! And if tackling a long book keeps you from wanting to read it, then get the audio books. A English actor, Jim Dale, reads them with voice inflections for each character...they are wonderful!"
920,6,Disappointing! Just don't skip the books in lieu of the movie!!!,"Whew!!! Did the beginning rock your insides or what?! It was fabulous and dark and brain cell burning fast! Quidditch was outstanding, my nose hairs quivered! I wanted more more more! The dementors/flowers-to-ice scene was incredible! I love Dawn French!!! And THEWLIS is the man...I mean Rickman...no Thewlis...wait..."
921,,Brilliance - drop the ball - Brilliance - drop the ball...,"Whew!!! Did the beginning rock your insides or what?!  It was fabulous and dark and brain cell burning fast! Quidditch was outstanding, my nose hairs quivered!  I wanted more more more!  The dementors/flowers-to-ice scene was incredible!  I love Dawn French!!!  And THEWLIS is the man...Rickman is still my love."
922,,Brilliance - drop the ball - Brilliance - drop the ball...,"First of all, I would like to say that these 3 kids are horrible actors and I absolutely HATE British accents! Anyways..."
923,5,This kid shouldn't be having any problems!,"If Sirius Black in fact was a friend of the Potters and did NOT betray them to Voldemort, why did he want to kill Harry? The scene where they all meet in the Shrieking Shack is so confusing: First we see Sirius about to kill Harry, but as soon as he and Lupin explain that Pettigrew is the real culprit, Sirius doesn't want to kill Harry anymore. Did anyone else have a problem with this? The same question must be asked about the book. It would have made sense if everyone THOUGHT Sirius had betrayed the Potters, which they did, but then when we meet Sirius, he explains that it was Pettigrew who was to blame and that he never wanted to kill Harry, that it just a rumor. All this said, I loved the film and all the others, too!"
924,8,Big Question,"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the best Harry Potter movie and here's why. The time travel is very logical and unique, the acting is great, the vfx are pretty good and overall pretty much everything is great."
925,10,Probably the best Harry Potter movie,"This movie fixes everything that went wrong in the others. the first two had (in my opinion) underdeveloped snape compared to him in the books. here, he gets more screen time. so does the current defense against the dark arts teacher, who has much more screen time than the teacher from the sorcerers stone."
926,10,best hp movie,"Now, I own this movie and one night when I watched it at home, I was fascinated by it. I think that the main soundtrack to it really fits in with the genre. The music sounds like magic! Another thing is, the acting is outstanding especially by Rupert Grint. He's a brilliant actor when it comes to being scared. But my favourite thing about this movie is the animation. The hippogrith that Hagrid owns looks real. The domentors look really freaky and all this clever animations look like it's actually there! But the reason that it lost a mark was because Albus Dumbledore sounds younger than the second and the first and I understand why. Also I thought Dumbledore's last actor was better than his new one. But I still think the movie is fantastic."
927,9,Fabulous animation! Fabulous acting! Fabulous music!,The best movie I've ever seen really I love it definitely deserves a better vote
928,10,Very good,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie because, although I haven't liked any of the movies as much as the books, they were still pretty good. However, this one left out too many important details from the book. I sat in the theater, bored and rolling my eyes. They focused too much on things that weren't important to the book and didn't stick to the story enough. Some key elements of the story aren't included in the movie, which was aggravating. I am aware that some things needed to be cut for time purposes, but there were things in the movie that weren't in the book. They could easily have left those things out and gotten the story right. It was pretty disappointing."
929,5,Disappointing,"I went to see the film with five small children (ages 6 to 9) ... while they all quite enjoyed it, none of them enthused about it, which is pretty damning given the huge success of the first two films."
930,2,Very disappointing ... (think of 'Batman and Robin'),"I am stunned to see opinion so strongly divided on this film, with many deriding it as a great disappointment and as the worst of the three Potter films so far. Personally, I believe the film to be in a completely different league to its two predecessors, surpassing and outclassing them so astoundingly it's almost embarrassing for poor old Columbus."
931,9,Completely outclasses the previous two,"I was never a huge fan of this movie. Everything changed and we feared the loss of Chris Columbus at the helm. With the unheard of director at the time, I feared that we would lose the fantasy element that we had with Chris Columbus, especially when Alfonso Cuaron started talking about ""coming of age"" rather than pure unadulterated magic."
932,8,Better With Time,"This film had a lot of potential. The third book was easily one of the best in the series, so naturally you shouldn't have to alter the storyline of the movie to much to make it dark and fun."
933,,It had it's moments.,(Possibly some spoilers)
934,,Cuaron delivers a more believable Potter,"I was so excited to see this movie. I thought it would be so great and amazing and better than all the others. I had only heard good things about it. But when I saw it, it was quite the contrary. "
935,,Terrible Abomination of the book,"This is far the best HP so far. This director should make all the sequels yet to come. There are some really beautiful shots. The way Alfonso Cuarón handles the camera is just great! And even those wizards get something believable now, where in the first two movies they all looked like out of place Halloween characters."
936,10,Great,"Harry Potter was a fantastic and well thought up series. The first and second films were pretty mature for children's movies, and I still admired their stories. However, I can see why they didn't pay up plot-wise to Prisoner of Azkaban. First things first, I'm a little reluctant about series that are directed by a numerous amount of directors. It gets... messy. However, this one film is the exception. Alfonso knows what he was doing. "
937,9,This film is holding no one prisoner,"I love the Harry Potter books.  I've read them several times, search obsessively for information about the new books and, yes, went to see the first two movies.  They left me flat.  Yes, they hit the plot points of Rowlings' books, but (in spite of their special effects) they lacked, frankly, the magic."
938,10,"Finally, The Spirit of The Books on Screen","WITHOUT considering the book(s), POA is probably the best of the Potter movies so far. It looks and feels more real than either of the first two, thanks in large part to improved special effects and striking scenery changes. Somehow, the spirit of Potter's world is more believable than before. It kept me engaged, excited, and talking to the screen, which is pretty remarkable, considering that I'm 41."
939,5,"Super Movie, But Only If You Haven't Read The Book","Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is a curious movie. It is probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, being a bit more sinister & gothic in both the look & content. It has, on the whole, better performances from the cast than the other movies. It doesn't seem to drag like the first 2 did in places. And the special effects are dazzling. Yet, as I pondered the movie a couple of hours after I had seen it. I found myself thinking `Yes it was probably the best of the 3 HP films so far, but what was missing' Well I eventually realised what was missing after watching the HP & the Chamber of Secrets' with my kids later that evening. I shall come to the missing ingredient a little later. It's Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts School of Wichcraft & Wizardry, & yet again he is caught up in mysterious goings on. The mass murderer Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard's prison `Azkaban' & is making a B-line for Hogwarts & in particular, it seems, Harry himself. It transpires that Sirius Black was the wizard responsible for the Death of Harry's parents, at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. As a result, the guards of Azkaban, or Dementors (think floaty Ringwraiths), have been stationed at Hogwarts to try to stop him. They do seem more intent on trying to suck the soul out of our hero. (That's what a Dementor does to its victim. It sucks all of the goodness out them until they are nothing but a living shell of a human). Add to this a Werewolf, a Hippogriff (a half horse, half eagle that can fly) & a menacing black dog that seems to be stalking Harry, & you have movie choc full of mystery & marvel. Now to the positives & negatives. Alfonso Cuaron has managed to get the best out of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter). He seems to be more at ease in front of a camera, when delivering his dialogue & you get the feeling that he has actually been given the proper encouragement & coaching. He seems to be a far more confident actor than the wooden puppet of the previous films. The other child actors are also very good, with both Emma Watson & Rupert Grint (Hermione Grainger & Ron Weasley) showing that they could have big careers ahead of them. In fact, the cast as a whole are pretty damn good. Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane & Dame Maggie Smith all slide comfortably back in to their usual rolls & are, as usual, excellent. The new members of the cast are also very good, with David Thewlis excellent as Professor Lupin and the magnificent Gary Oldman (chewing up & spitting out every scene he is in, with relish) as the sinister Sirius Black. The actor with the hardest job out of the whole cast was Sir Michael Gambon. He had the unenviable task of replacing the late Sir Richard Harris. Thankfully he slips in to Dumbledore's robes with the minimum of fuss, playing it more as a bumbling old hippy rather than the imperious & imposing Harris' Dumbledore."
940,8,The best so far.,"What I liked most about the movie was its ending. Harry zooming on his Firebolt and appearing really happy was, in my opinion, a different, but good ending. And just prior to the ending were some disappointing parts. Like the part where Peter Pettigrew is seen on the Marauders' Map, the complete absence of the concept of the Marauders, the Firebolt coming in pretty late into the movie, the werewolf looking like something that I could swat away with a tennis racquet, no Cho Chang :-) ... I could go on."
941,,"Good in parts, bad in parts, but needs to be watched!","O.K., I write this as a ""Harry Potter BOOK fan."" My sister and I are huge fans of the five novels, and the first two films (great adaptions!) But when we saw this film, we were greatly disappointed! They took out A LOT, and added A LOT. There was a shrunken head on the night bus. They took out the quidditch cup, they took out Crookshanks' involvement with Sirius Black. They did not explain the whole ""protection spell"" Dumbledore used on Harry and his parents. And what was with changing Hogwarts so much?! Dememtors flying?! Sirius NOT slashing Ron's drapes with a knife?! This film being shorter than BOTH of the previous films?! That new director RUINED my second favorite Harry Potter novel! They deleted AT LEAST a hundred and fifty pages of the book, and added TOO MUCH new (and stupid) material. There was some dumb hunchback, and Harry behaved too much like a hero. The novel is 435 pages, and the fourth novel is 734 pages. I shudder to think how much they'll butcher the fourth film. If you are a loyal book fan, DO NOT see this film, read the books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ** out of **********"
942,4,A poor adaption of one of the greatest novels of all time (SPOILERS),"As a film very good, as an adaption from a novel not so good."
943,7,"As a film very good, as an adaption from a novel not so good.",[Caution: May contain spoilers]
944,9,8¾/10 [with explanation],"In the third installment in the box office phenomena, Harry Potter, Harry is confronted with some new dangers. Hogwarts might not be enough to protect Harry from his new nemesis (or so everyone thinks), Sirius Black. The ending of this film has the most spectacular plot-twists of all the films (er... books) in my opinion. It introduces us to Harry's father's two best friends and the man who betrayed them."
945,9,PoA is a big yay!,"Unlike Harry Potter 2, this film showed a lot of improvements on the screen in terms of things that I characterized as bad in commenting on the previous sequel to Harry Potter. Compared to the previous sequel, this sequel shows better acting and an increased presence of uncertainty and drama which is good. The actors have matured and their acting skills have slowly begun to improve (although they have shown very good skills as beginners in their work in the first part of Harry Potter). In that sense, I would like to thank to the screenwriter for throwing out unnecessary dialogues and dramatic breaks, as well as the directors who removed children's facial expressions from actors and thus opened the way for the Harry Potter franchise to move from the children's world to the adult world. In my opinion, JKR took a short ,,break,, in writing story for filming this part of the movie, because it is obvious that the story is not as interesting as it was in the first two parts of the film. But that's ok. It is important that all of them react in time to the question of making the unreal become real, both by writing and screening. In this sequel to the film, the emphasis is on mysticism and the relationships between people, both for solving the mystery in this part and for evaluating the characters themselves, and I support that. What is missing in this part are those interesting activities, events and actions that complement the film itself, which in the case of the theme of this film is already accustomed to his audience because they are constantly hungry for magic, strange and new things and knowledge from the world of magic. I liked the inversion of mysticism regarding the original suspicion of Sirius Black, which later got its positive turn, as well as solving that mystery with a part of returning time. What I would work on a little more is the relationship between Harry Potter and his family with Draco Malfoy because it is still childish and pathetic and deserves a more serious and realistic look. The part with the Dementors deserved a longer and more meaningful epilogue as well, and the evaluation of Professor McGonagall's character should be done urgently, she seems to be becoming an old grandmother who doesn't know what she's talking about or where she is and her position is quite demanding.<br /><br />I will see this sequel as a break, as I said, and an opportunity to turn Harry Potter into a more realistic magical world, if it can be called that at all, and catch the train to gain a big name in the world of cinema, both in the field of action and in the field of filming. We are waiting for the next sequel to see what has been done on this issue."
946,7,Things are starting to get better!,"Whoever hired this director should be smacked hard. That was about the worst choice they could have possibly made for Director. He needlessly changed so much. Why change the whole look of the school? It was wonderfully magical in the first two movies. In this one it looked totally different, and to no purpose. The costumes also were terrible. Dumbledore looked more like a homeless person than a headmaster of Hogwarts. I realize you were working with a different actor, but you could at least stay true to the character from the book. And what was the deal with the kids' costumes? They were always wearing street clothes when the books made it clear they only wore clothes like that when they were in the Muggle world. Effects were okay, although I agree with a lot of other people that the werewolf stunk. It looked like he somehow stopped transforming half way through. Finally, the look, the tone of the film was all wrong. In the first two movies the muggle world was all gray and flat, reflecting Harry's view of that world. Then the wizard world at Hogwarts was colorful and vibrant because that was where Harry really came alive. This movie, though, has the wizard world all flat and gray and dingy. Why? To what purpose? I know the kids are growing up and becoming more adult, but Hogwarts shouldn't change. We could get a perfectly good picture of the kids growing up without changing the school from a vibrant magical world to a dreary awful place. I was horribly disappointed in this movie. Whoever hired this director for this movie must have been drunk to think he could pull it off. One final thing: the imdb trivia mentions that the fountain at the school has eagles eating snakes because it is the symbol on the Mexican flag where the director comes from. What rubbish! It is perfectly fine and appropriate for him to put imagery like that into a movie about Mexico. But this is a British film about a British school in Great Britain, for pity's sake! Get over yourself already and don't put pointless extra stuff in that doesn't fit in the story. Sheesh!"
947,4,Disappointing,"How do you fit a 560+ page book into a 2 hr. 20 minute movie? Well, the answer is, you don't. Kloves and Cuaron hacked and slashed the original story down to a barely passable minimum, which will no doubt be somewhat confusing to those who've not read the book. However, the original Prisoner of Azkaban story by author J.K. Rowling is so brilliant that even Kloves and Cuaron couldn't deal it a death blow."
948,7,"""Cliff Notes"" version of PoA still pretty good!",My favorite film harry potter. And favori character is Snape ! Amazing :)
949,10,The film was breatinthting,"(possible spoiler) FIRE the director, FIRE the wardrobe, and DEFINITELY FIRE the screenwriter. Did they even read the book?? I read the book several times and once again before going to the movie and don't even know where to begin with all that they did wrong. They didn't even tell Harry who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are/ were! They screwed up so many times on this that I'm just p***ed and am expecting an apology. They better at least read the book before doing the next few! I'm appalled. They added unnecessary scenes, took out necessary scenes, trashed the book, forgot very important aspects, and included many distracting scenes that had, well, nothing to do with anything! I honestly think that this movie is only good if you aren't a true fan of the books. If you've read this one at all, don't be surprised by how much they trashed it. It was such a good base for a movie, why change it?"
950,,Did they even read the book??,"Having not read this, or indeed any of the Harry Potter books I enjoy these movies with an open mind. I have read many of the comments placed here and it is clear I am in a minority because I haven't read the books. As a non-reader I am happy to report that this movie is by far the best."
951,10,Having not read the book...,"First, I have to say that I have never read a Harry Potter book. Although I know several people, including my wife, who LOVE the books, and they have had very positive responses to this series of films. For a non-reader of the books, I have come to love Harry Potter through the films. Many believe that since the films are not strict enough to their adherence of the source material, they shouldn't even bother. I can't argue with that since I have never read any of the books, since the films are so good, I don't really intend to anytime soon. I actually dreaded the first of the Harry Potter films (""...and the Sorcerer's Stone"") but after its release on DVD, I really enjoyed it. I found the cast to be incredible, particularly its three young stars whose talent belies their age. The second film ""...and the Chamber of Secrets"" was even more enjoyable since the film got to play with the characters more without the pains of exposition. I found that Chris Columbus, who I thought was a relatively talented screenwriter but not a very good director, finally started taking some cues from his mentor, Steven Spielberg, for his work on the first two Potter films. Now we have a new director in Alfonso Cuaron and a very different tone to the series. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is much darker in tone, in story, and in pallette than either of the previous films. The performances are stronger and more mature and the subject matter is decidedly less child-friendly. This film is literally and figuratively Harry Potter's puberty; a time of great change and fear and development. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are all pitch-perfect in this film, as are the newest members of the story, Professor Lupin (Another brilliant performance by the great David Thewlis) and Sirius Black (the always fascinating Gary Oldman). This film should almost have been called ""Chamber of More Secrets"" since the film has so many vast and important revelations that the world of Harry Potter will change forever. I almost forgot to mention the wonderful Alan Rickman, who once again reprising his role as the serpentine Professor Severus Snape, has a much larger part to play in this film and in Harry's future. This film also is forced to deal with the very unfortunate loss of Sir Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but bounces back because of the great Michael Gambon taking the character in not a different direction, but certainly a change from the sage-like saintly portrayal of Harris's into more of a spry and jocular Dumbledore, one who can command respect but still has a great twinkle in his eye. All in all, this is a great film, not just as a piece of summer escapism, but as a real film that could hold its own against almost any of the recent award-winning films."
952,,"The Best of the Series, and the Best Summer Release thus far.","Let me first say that I love the books, so I know automatically that the movies aren't going to satisfy me as well, but I loved the first two movies, and I was not satisfied with this one.  First of all, and the biggest flaw, was the adaptation from book to movie.  The book had rich detail in the new things readers discover at Hogwarts, while the movie talks about them for 2 minutes and forgets about them.  To me, the books were so good because Rowling used amazing atmosphere to drive the story.  Around every corner there is something new and fascinating happening, she describes happenings in the book in a way that lets you SEE what you are reading.  Rowling succeeds more in giving us a visual picture by reading than the whole movie put together gives us.  half of the movie is not like I imagined it in the book.  Also, they shortened the dialogue I believe to keep the children's attention, and made the pace of the movie far too fast.  Some people would consider this a great thing, but for me, after reading a 300 page book with great dialogue, I want to see some good conversations to further develop the characters.  Ron Weasley, one of the main stars in the books(and previous movies) is given maybe, and that's just maybe, 6 or 7 lines in the entire movie!!  The rest of the time he stands around holding Scabbers.  Professor Mconagall is given one line and Dumbledore is given one good scene, and then completely disregarded.  No one can replace Richard Harris as Dumbledore properly.  So, I may be the only one that sees this, but making a movie that is fast paced like this, and forgetting about the characters is pointless. I would have rather had a 3 hour long movie with an actual plot intact than this 2 hour 20 minute mess. However there are some good things about this movie that force me to give a higher rating than you would expect. The opening of the movie is just right, and is exteremely funny to watch.  Alfonso Cauron's vision for the movie is amazing as well.  He has his own visual style for this one that is atmospheric most of the time. Some of the scenes are like I imagined in the book, but unfortunately many of the scenes were not, especially the demontors attack. "
953,,Not satisfying (May be a couple of spoilers),"Perhaps I'm writing this review as a Mexican who is proud of the mexican director of the film, but aside some nationalistic feelings this is probably the best of the three Potter films so far. I've read the book before watching the film, just as I did with the other two Potter films and one way that tells me that is better is that I didn't get bored at the middle of the movie (because I knew all the things)."
954,9,Probably the best so far...,So there Chris Columbus.
955,,my favorite of the Potter films,"I saw the film last night with great anticipation, and boy did it deliver! The whole look of the film looks so much better, the uniforms, the style, Hogwarts itself, Cuaron has done a great job too in creating a darker film. The film is rushed and yes there are bits from the book missing but I think Steve Kloves has done a great job in creating a screenplay perfect for the big screen. Remember this is a film and not a book! The problem with the first two was that they were too long especially Chamber of Secrets which, with the deleted scenes felt like  they were trying to film the entire book! This film though is perfect for timing, the Quidditch match is long enough as are the rest of the scenes. Everything rolled out quite nicely. I will see it again most notably for the scene where Ian Brown (ex Stone Roses singer) makes a cameo appearance! He is the first wizard you see in the Leaky Cauldron. Overall I give the film 9/10"
956,9,Best film of the year so far! Best of the three!,"This movie was definitely an interesting watch, seeing it in an IMAX theatre increased the suspense particularly in the Quidditch match, but the larger image did make the CGI look noticeable, but not too bad."
957,9,"Great, even better in IMAX","First off the VISUAL STYLE of this film was very artistic and dark. It went in a new direction that tossed aside the established world of wonder that Chris Columbus set us up with in the first two films. In some ways this is good, in others distracting and uncomfortable. "
958,7,Interesting visuals that fail to make up for poor Storytelling.,"I have always loved the Harry Potter series. I have read them all 3 times, and prisoner of Azkaban I have read 4. PoA is my favorite book in the series and because of that I was greatly looking forward to seeing the movie. I have been anticipating its release since the release of CoS and was finally able to see the movie. "
959,,Slightly disappointed,Harry potter and the prison of azkaban is definitely the best Harry potter movie it has a good story and I like how the villain is from the beginning is ron mouse and I like how he's live with ron family for 20 years<br /><br />And i like the time travel it's almost airtight<br /><br />And things I don't like it you can't just put the time travel without missing the things a little bit and now I have a question about you know why is not everybody traveling time and careful the most before he's killed Harry's parents I really hate this JK Rowling can say it's just travel time 24 hours.
960,8,Spoiler: warning,"I am almost 27 years old. A lawyer. A pianist. A computer freak. But above all, a Harry Potter maniac. And I feel proud to admit that, because, for me, the HP universe is something extremely exceptional, powerful, full of substance and every true value we hold. A whole new complicated, parallel to ours, world with a lot to teach every kid or adult, capable of making each and every one of us think and think again. The character analysis is awesome and the plot childly enjoyable but brilliantly mature. So, I'm a HP fan. And, naturally, I've read all the books (10 times each) and I've watched all the movies (20 times each!!).I loved the first movie, I had some objections about but still I enjoyed much the second one. But the third book was destined to give the best motion picture. Because it has everything in it, all the very fine ingredients to provide a great total!! Because of the Olympic Games, the movie came out in Athens in September 2004 and after a lot of irritating waiting we rushed to the cinema the very first day, full of excitement and predisposed absolutely positively. The result: THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF MY LIFE.THE HARDEST ONE TOO... Is that movie an ""adult"" movie as they baptized it?Why? Because it has nothing to do with Potter?Because it was deprived of everything that matters in the Potter universe? Because ""magic"" is a ""childish"" thing and we have to eliminate it to make a mature movie?Or the kids wearing cloaks and uniforms of Hogwarts would humiliate Cuaron's creation?And I ask all of those who have read the sixth book, how in the name of God is this little ""sissy"" of Cuaron's Draco going to be the person he is supposed to be in the 6th movie??? The atmosphere is changed dramatically and not because of the Dementor's presence. The Hogwarts is changed substantially too, and not because of the different location. Of all the classical British super-actors, only few remain decent and even fewer do something more than that. From all the new characters only Trelawney makes a statement-but that's because she is Ema Thompson-and Thewlis' Lupin is also something relatively memorable, while Gary Oldman's Black is not acting but absolutely overreacting, making you think whether Black was in Azkaban or in St Mungus' Hospital!!And that's definitely not Odlman's fault.Further more, the unavoidable replacement of the late Harris' Dubbledore with the Gambon's one has seemed to have a deteriorating effect on the Headmaster!He simply is...less magical, less proud, less grave, less ""aristocratic"", less important and less.....clean.And that's not Gambon's fault either..... The only really decent element of the movie is the artistic creation of the beasts. Hippogriff is a piece of art and Dementors exactly as anybody would picture them reading Rowling's description.Some elements of the plot - things that could not be anyway altered - also remain thrilling or sentimental or terrorizing but the question is whether all these are enough to save the movie... When, in the beginning of the movie, the Knight bus is running on the streets of London and it is IT that gets out of the way of things and not THE THINGS getting out of ITS way (like in the book), we overpass it without difficulty.But, in the end, it's all about the same thing: GET THE MAGIC OUT OF THE WAY. Deminisize it. Reduce it. Eliminate it...Or even humiliate it (see shrieking heads, the most ridiculous idea in the history of ridiculous ideas...). Cuaron is no fan of HP. He knows it. We know it.I doubt whether he has ever read any other HP book except from the 3rd one//If we accept that he has really read that too!And he has the right too hate HP and magic in general.What he is not allowed to do is force us to witness the desecration of our beloved world!!!THAT HE CANNOT DO!! 6/10 only because it is theoretically based on the third HP book, a triumph of J.Rowling..."
961,6,The best book...the worst movie...,I have to say I thought the first Harry potter film (Harry potter and the philosophers stone) was incredibly rushed and not thought through. It seemed as if the director was in such a rush to get the film on the big screen that he did not take his time to do it. The second (Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets) was better than the first but I still felt it was rushed.
962,6,New director and a better potter film,"The third book of the Harry Potter series has by far been my most favorite, and I would have liked its movie to go along with the book. The change of a lot of things have caused it to be slightly different and strange than the rest of the two movies. Hogwarts castle seems to be amidst tonnes of greenery and was much better in the first two movies."
963,,"Good, Bad... Not fantastic!","I have read a lot of comments written by fans of the books who disliked the movie because it was not faithful to the most minute detail. I, for one, must say that I am a stickler for detail as well as a big fan of the books. I LOVED ""THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN."" The magical tone of the movie covered up any minor discontinuities between the book and the movie. The acting was fabulous, especially the three young leads, who have matured brilliantly since ""CofS"". Also amazing was David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the series, and I was a little nervous as to how his character was going to be treated. But from the first scene on the train, my fears were blown away. The one disclaimer I must add is that if you have not read the book, you might get really confused as to what is going on, because many plot elements are left unexplained (this, however, is not a problem if you've read the book). 10 out of 10. A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS OF THE BOOK"
964,10,"Loved the book, loved the movie!","Right away, you can tell that a much more talented person directed this. I noticed the better performances from the kids, the camera-work, and the stylized way it ended. You just couldn't ask for a better director. We still get some of the good qualities that made the first two movies into entertaining adventures like the humor, special effects, the musical score, and some likable characters. My favorite character is still Snape but I went on to prefer Prof. Lupin instead, I felt sorry for him at the end. Another character that stood out for me was Buckbeat, he has to be one the most beautiful non-existent creatures to ever be made by CGI."
965,9,Almost a Masterpiece,"I went to see Harry Potter and the Prizener of Azkaban In theaters and I saw it on DVD and each time I could not believe how badly It was written. I don't even think they read the book and If you didn't read the book then turn off your computer go to Barnes and Noble and buy all six Harry potter books. Now this movie would not be entirely bad if they just left stuff out but they actually changed the book! And it wasn't just a little thing here and there they changed major things. I'm not going to say what they where all I can say is that you should get the book, read it, and then watch the movie again to see how much worse the are then the books. The S.E. were pretty good even though every time any one cast a spell it looked like wind shot out and that was that. The acting wasn't very good and the best actor by far was Allen Rickman who is a perfect Snape. All in all I hated this movie"
966,2,did they even read the book?!?,"When I saw Harry Potter Three, I was utterly psyched. The first and second movies had been so good so that I thought the third would be awesome (especially because of the Dementors). Turns out the Dementors were quite different then in the book. I mean, they're not supposed to fly or freeze things over...and why did they skip so much other important stuff? Unless you've actually read the book, the movie makes no sense. In fact, I've read the book numerous times, and I was a little confused. "
967,,Not great...kind of disappointing...,Harry Potter and The prisoner of Azkaban ----- 9/10
968,9,Fantastic,"I really enjoyed watching this new installment of the Harry Potter series. I thought that the special effects were a brilliant part that helped bring Hogwarts, Buckbeak, and many other animations to life. Although I liked the book better, I do give credit to Alfonso Cuaron for giving the audience a good and enjoyable movie. He managed to use great special effects with a good story, although the book had a much better story, and I was more anxious to find out the ending of the book than watching the movie. And one part of the movie that I missed very much was Richard Harris who had a great performance in the previous installments. I think the new Dumbledore didn't have the voice and the look to make it seem that Dumbledore was one of the greatest wizards of the wizard world. Again all three young actors, Harry, Ron, and Hermione pull off another great performance together. Including the acting from Sirius, Snape, and Lupin who give outstanding performances that gives the movie a better feel. So I certainly await with great excitement the fourth installment of Harry Potter, which by the way is my favorite book."
969,7,The book was better...But it was Great!!,"Like almost half this planet I am a Harry Potter fan and yes I did queue up outside a cinema on the day of release to see this film (despite the fact I was on holiday in France and had to behave like a true fan and sit through the French dubbed version before I could see it in English, just so I could see it on the day it came out)"
970,10,Better than the first two,I will start by voicing my initial disappointment when I first saw the film in the movie theater in 2004. I was so disappointed I've avoided watching it again until recently. I had hoped I'd like it better the second time but sadly I did not.
971,5,Somewhat entertaining at it's best but mostly disappointing,"You see the books are excellent in fact, the prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite. But the thing is the movie missed out sooooo much and it didn't make sense. Like for instance. Lupin new how to use the Marauders map but it never said why. Sirius and Peter were animagus but it never explained how that came to be. It never said how they were the marauders and how they used to run around the school with a werewolf and how it was THEM that wrote the marauders map. i think that if you make a movie then you should do it right and not change the story line. they even changed the prophecy that Professor Trelawny made! the effects were good but the story line was lo lo."
972,,MMM it was OK...,"(Disclaimer: Minor, non-plot-centered spoilers)"
973,6,"Enjoyable, but many unnecessary changes","After many years of avoiding the harry potter films my mum invited me to sit down with her and watch a few. after watching the first movie i wasn't particularly surprised or looking forward to the next films. i read the first 3 books when they were first out and was looking forward to this film remembering that i enjoyed the story. I think the choice of getting in the new director was a masterstroke, although the first two films were aimed towards the younger audience this one was less predictable and far more entertaining. Without initially realising it director Cuarón was involved with both Y tu mama tambien and Great expectations(or which i enjoy both), i was still keen to look up what he had done previously."
974,7,fun for all ages,"I started my career as a Harry Potter fan at the age of 6. When I discovered that they would be made into movies, I immediately felt hesitant to see them. What if they were completely manipulated? Changed around? What if the actors and actresses were no good? Fortunately, I was not disappointed. Though many things were changed about the movies, they left all of the important things in there, while throwing in several new twists. This movie is no exception. I was delighted at how well everything was portrayed. Almost exactly as I had read it. I was delighted at the wonderful one-liners thrown in, and was completely mystified by the concept of going back in time. Yet another spectacular feeling was fear. The dementors, the fear of facing a boggart, and the idea of having a killer looking for you are quite terrifying. The stars of this series may be growing up, but they still manage to act out the characters magnificently."
975,,One of my favorite Potter films...,"The third chapter of Harry's life at Hogwarts begins. This film is better than the first two Harry Potter movies because it's so much funnier. One of the funny scenes was when Aunt Marge come over for dinner. She calls Harry's parents ""unemployed drunks"" and finally Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has had it. All of a sudden she starts blowing up like a balloon and floated out of the house. The funny thing was that two scenes later you see her floating over a house, yelling for someone to help her. Another was when Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) were bickering about Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, chasing Scabbers, Ron's pet rat. They will later be seen arguing about whether or not Scabbers is dead and if it was killed by Crookshanks. The Fat Lady singing was also funny. She can't sing and she was trying to break a glass cup that she was holding. She started to scream causing everyone to shut their eyes and cover their ears. She broke the class on the wall behind her and claimed that she did it by singing. I think that everyone's favorite part of the movie was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione caught Malfoy (Tom Felton)about to witness the execution of Buckbeak, a hippogriff that attacked after Malfoy insulted it. Hermione walked over to him and pointed her wand at him. Ron told Hermione that ""he's not worth it"". She looks at Malfoy, who it seems started crying, and lowers her wand. She turns and him laughing. All of a sudden she turns around really fast and punching in the face. Some parts of the movie were scary. The scene where the dementer enters the train to Hogwarts. It almost sucked the happiness out Harry. Luckily, Professor Lupin made it go away. Another was when the dementer attacked Harry at a Quidditch match. He fell off his broom and wake in the hospital where he learned that only they lost the game but his broom went into the Whomping Willow (it was destroyed in other words). Harry also, later in the film, learns Hermione's secret to getting to all her classes was a time-turner when they traveled back in time to free Buckbeak and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a falsely accused murderer. At the end of the movie Harry receives a Firebolt, the fastest broom in the world, by Sirius. I think this movie was the best also because more people watched it more than the first two films. Before my cousin saw it she thought Harry Potter was alright. After she saw it she bought all the books and we now talk about Harry Potter every time she calls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, tragedy, and magic all in a film."
976,10,The Hogwarts Trio start their third year with magical creatures and learn about past betrayals,"i remember when i watched this movie in the movie theater. i loved it. definitely one of the best ones of the harry potter franchise. then, in Christmas, my parents gave me the widescreen DVD version of this film. in that time, i didn't liked the widescreen format, now i love it. but, since back then i didn't liked the widescreen format, i sold the widescreen DVD version i got, and i bought the fullscreen version later. that was one of the biggest mistakes i've made in my life. i mean, when you watch the movie, the picture quality is horrible!another thing is that,like, in one shot, harry potter might be talking to Professor Lupin, and you see harry but you don't see Professor Lupin! that's retarded! it looks as if harry was talking to himself! and, there's drizzle in the whole movie! warner bros. might have forgotten to clean the picture quality of this movie. the picture quality for this movie is surely of the worst I've seen in my life. another thing is that, in one scene, harry potter and rons dad are talking in the leaky cauldron, in the left down side of the screen you see a code or something like that. i think those things come in every DVD in history. im not sure what they are for, but in this movie, they are so easy to catch! so, overall, don't buy this fullscreen version. its such a wonderful movie and it is a real shame to watch it in such a horrible picture quality. even if you don't like widescreen pictures, still buy the widescreen version for this movie. you will find out that some buy black bars and a small picture are nothing compared to drizzle an sloppy camera angles."
977,6,"wonderful movie, horrible DVD","I'm sorry to put it this hard, but the director ruined the movie entirely!!!"
978,,The magic is lost! And he stole it!,"No longer a disney magic kingdom Hogwarts, but a mystical place of the imagination.  Not a rote by the numbers read along with the story film, but a cinematic vision of the book.  Of course there are more differences but the spirit is truer.  It will get harder and harder to keep all the details of each book as the books get longer and longer.  This director took the bull by the horns, wrestled with it, and put his stamp on it.  I find myself so enthralled with his vision that yesterday I just had to visit Hogwarts again and took an extended lunch hour to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 4th time.  Went back to work humming Double Trouble.  I do think that the Mauraders Map and the relationship of Prongs, et al. especially with the shape of the Patronus could have been explicated in just a few more lines with Sirius and the final Lupin scene, and needed to be. But when I compare how rote the other films were, especially the 2nd, and I think of Buck Beak dragging his claw in the loche and the four seasons of the whomping willow, Harry's talks with Lupin, all the details that just melt into the affectionate yet dangerous landscape, well I just sigh with happiness that there is finally a HP movie that I like as much of the books. I had almost given up.  Gets a 92 from me!"
979,9,"Finally, a cinematic Harry Potter!",Chris Columbus where are you?!  Unlike the first two Harry Potter films this film was made only for those who have read the book.  It is close to impossible to understand exactly what the heck is going on if you have not previously read the book.  
980,3,The Worst of the Harry Potter Films,When I first started watching the movie I was having troubles with it I was POed how many changes that where made and wished they kept the same people all the people in it and as well as me catching a few glitches in the movie like the scar changing positions in the movie from hiss right brow to his left as in the first two harry potter movies I didn't catch any glitches. sos&cos where greater by far and wished the directors stayed the same and actors needed to be the same for as of professor Dumbodurf needed to be the same character would have mad it a little better of chores the change in the castle was awful how you got to Hacrids place was way off in it you mad it down hill when in sos&cos it was on flat land to it now mad it down hill I now thing lord of the rings out beat this movie by far.
981,1,This movie isn't the greatest at all,"This excellent film was easy to follow since we had read the book with our kids. However, had I been the director (not much chance of that) I definitely would have explained the meaning, on the Maurauder's Map, of ""Mooney (Lupin), Wormtail (Petegrew), Padfoot (Black), and Prongs (Potter's dad, James). The context/depth of their friendship was absent as was the significance of Harry's Patronis - the stag. The degree of Petegrew's betrayal can't be fully appreciated without that background. Without the book, following the reltionships would have been confusing. Superb, even touching, scenes of Harry having several discussions with Proff. Lupin while the other kids were in town."
982,8,Editing cut out important detail,I saw the film today. What can I say?
983,,Whimsical Confusion,"My wife and I have read all of the books and own the first two movies on DVD. We recently went to see the Prisoner of Azkaban and were both greatly disappointed in what we saw. Granted you can't make a movie with every scene from the book but there were too many scenes left out that make you understand a little more about the characters. The softer, darker environment is not as inviting to the viewer as the first movies. It had a too real quality to it where this has always been a fantasy world. The Hogwarts grounds look nothing like what we saw in the first movies, which makes you feel they have changed locations and didn't tell anyone. This director did a terrible job with this movie and I hope they don't allow him to do another. My only suggestion is for them to hurry up and finish the movies before they have to change main actors because of them being too old. We can't wait for the next two books. But, what will we do when it's all over?"
984,1,Movie lacks the fantasy world of the book,So let me try to explain my feelings about this movie.
985,8,I don't believe in one line summaries...,"This movie I personally thought was better than the first two. It had a lot more humor, better filming, and yes, almost every single guy was A LOT hotter! Malfoy, Harry, Ron, the Weasley twins... Need I mention more? I think in some ways this movie was better but in other ways it wasn't. One thing I didn't like was that there wasn't as much music in the background and it didn't follow the books as much as the first two did. There were also a lot of scary scenes. The first two were okay for little kids but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one! I'm even debating whether to take my 9 year old sister or not! I definitely think this was an awesome movie and I hope you think the same!!!!!!"
986,10,Better than the first two in some ways...,"The third installment in the Harry Potter film series is upon us. Finally, Chris Columbus has relinquished the directorial chair to Alfonso Cuaron, director of such diverse fare as the racy Y Tu Mama Tambien and the enthralling A Little Princess. That has been the best move in three movies so far. Sorry Chris C., Cuaron has basically kicked your a$s on this one. Because the third installment is decidedly darker in theme than the first two (and gets even darker as the series progresses--JK Rowling where is your sixth book!), Cuaron has reflected this in the more pensive and muted tones and colors of this movie. It seems more real (and more depressing) than the all-too-magical feel of its predecessors. Hence, additional quaint charm. This does not detract one bit from the story and the action, still suspenseful and awe-inspiring even if you have read and re-read the books countless times. Of course, fangirls like your truly everywhere will not hesitate to point out that much of the story has been cut and simplified to better fit the genre of feature film--something that Chris Columbus seems to have been loathe to do, but which Alfonso Cuaron uses to full advantage here. (Would that he would direct the rest of the series.)"
987,,'Prisoner' Captivates,"OK, I went into this movie with hope that it would be better than what I'd seen on TV of it. However, I was sadly disappointed with it. "
988,,... Where's the book's influence?,"Many people have done it before, ruin a great book by making a film about it, but this is by far one of the worst book movies ever. I love the Harry Potter books, every single one of them has a sort of magic that's very rare, a magic that both kids and adults like. The movies on the other hand, are a totally different story."
989,5,How to turn in a great book into a bad movie,"With Alfonso Cuaron on board as the new director for the third Harry Potter movie, the movies start to make a turn-around. While Columbus's movies were good, he adapted every single part of the book into the movie, which caused them to be good adaptions, but without any original material. Cuaron's new approach allows this movie to have an equal balance of original material and adaptation."
990,9,Cuaron takes a new approach,"Well, I just saw the 3rd, and for my money, least effective of the Harry Potter films. The first were made by Chris Columbus, who created and held the interest of the famous books, and also delved into special effects magic to create exciting, and yet, somewhat dramatic films. This 3rd film, directed by Alfonso Cuaroz, who directed the far over-rated ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", fails to understand the true efforts of the novels. He has created a dark and somewhat moody film, but one, also that has the slowest pacing of all 3...(and this is the shortest). it simply drags on, no interesting new characters..(one is an obvious villain from the start) and the other, Emma Thompson, no less, is so broad and silly, she fails to communicate the intricate comedy she attempts to. And the special effects here, as sadly disappointing. A creation introduced by Robbie Coltrane, looks pale in comparison to some of the greater effects in the earlier films. "
991,,"Good, but....","This is possibly the worst attempt by Hollywood to convert a 1000+ page book into a movie less than 2 hours long. It was like seeing a Cliff Notes on screen...many of my favorite parts from the book were cut, the little touches that made the book so endearing. The characters were not fleshed out at all, none of the child actors can act (They should have been replaced for this movie...children that can kind of act when they're young do not always mature into great actors in their teens), and it seemed to me that if the viewer came in with no prior knowledge of the Harry Potter, they would be lost, and what's more, I doubt they would care. Pitiful."
992,5,Shallow and ultimately pointless,"Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban was the longest of the three books they made into movies, yet it was the shortest movie. I happen to love Harry Potter and was looking forward to this movie a great deal. It was my favorite book throughout the entire series. I would have loved it if it was more like the book. I have a few complaints about it. One, the werewolf was horrible, it reminded me of Gollum. Two, the dementors don't follow HArry into the storm, and he reads more on the Marauders Map. Three, since when does Peter Pettigrews get found by Harry? Four, where did the Quidditch cup match go. Five, why was the firebolt at the end and why did he know Sirius sent it to him. Six, why wasn't the Quidditch World Cup mentioned at the end along with Ron getting the owl. And when, when did Sirius speech only take five minutes when it was two chapters of Dialog. I know if someone Killed MY parents I wouldn't believe them in five minutes. Especially if i know they went to a jail that's supposed to drive them mad. But that's just my opinion, I'm glad they got another director for the fourth book."
993,,Wish it was more like the books some spoilers.,"I saw this movie about a month ago and i kept thinking about it. i think the new director is much better than Chris Colombus. i read the book just before i saw the movie and if you compare the book with the film the film is disappointing but anyway, the acting keeps getting better and better and i loved the acting of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis. the film is about Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts school. this time Harry and his friends are supposed to find out about a murderer called Sirius Black. meanwhile the new defense against the dark arts teachers might be able to help Harry and his friends. this time we learn some new spells that will prepare us for the goblet of fire(fourth movie). i would definitely recommend to you."
994,8,My comments about Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"I was truly disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to it but the movie was a total mess. People might say Alfonso Cuaron 'got the real idea of Harry Potter' but the truth is, he didn't at all get the idea of Harry Potter. I must say Chris Columbus was much, much more better. He got the real vision of the world of Harry Potter.There were a lot of things that were messed up in the movie. In the Leaky Cauldron, you must have noticed that the bartender swished his hand and the chair went up and the fact that there was a wizard waving his finger around a spoon. Well, that's not supposed to happen since Wizards and witches in Harry Potter books can only perform magic using wands, the fingers and the hand are useless. Ron did not have a crush for Madame Rosmerta and the Three Broomsticks was not suppose to be closed. Lupin looks bit of than what I imagined him to look like. Hermione doesn't have bushy hair, which is just simply wrong cuz she's suppose to have bushy hair only on the fourth book, during the Yule Ball she made her hair looked sleek and shiny, not the third book. And by the way, Lupin in this movie sounded like he had a crush on Lily Potter. The script writer had said that that was an assumption but the way he is saying that he thinks Remus has a crush on Lily is wrong. They are creating a movie that shows the third book, not assumptions. The bad thing is people are going to assume that Remus does have a crush on lily. Well if it's correct, it's not a matter anymore but if it isn't, well, that's is going to be a problem for non-Harry Potter readers. Neville is thin, for goodness's sake! He's suppose to be plum and fat, not thin! The Neville in the 1st and 2nd movie looked like the Nevill I know in the books."
995,5,Worst HP movie ever!,"PG(Supernatural Themes, Some Violence|142MINS|Adventure, Family, Fantasy Users need to know that this third installment in the Harry Potter series is growing up with the Hogwarts crew; the themes are darker, the peril is more intense, and the images of fantasy creatures are grotesque and frightening. For a great percentage of the school year, Harry believes he is marked for death and hunted by an escaped prisoner. He also battles a creature of kids' worst nightmare: the Dementors are black-cloaked floating beings that suck out happiness and feed on your worst fears, which is why Harry hears the sound of his mother's last scream when he sees them. While this can be frightening for young and sensitive viewers, the bright side is the Boggart lesson in Defence Against The Dark Arks. Boggarts can turn into a person's worst fears, but the children learn to yell 'Ridiculous!' and turn their fears into something humorous."
996,10,Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban,"Effects are amazing, it's a fun spectacle."
997,6,"Be a movie, or be a book. Not this half-assed thing.","Once again, I sold my soul to Satan and took in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, adapted from the third novel of J. K. Rowling's blockbuster series of juvenile fantasy."
998,8,A solid continuation of the series,"I have never seen a movie of Cuarón before, but it was definitely a good choice to let him direct the third movie. What Columbus did was a boring and annoyingly long illustration of the books, not noticing that the passionate Harry Potter readers had grown older, so the audience expected more than a nice and sweet Disney-like entertainment. Cuarón changed the whole look of the set and gave the characters a chance to play. He also used a lot of nice shots full of metaphoric quality. There are a lot of detail shots with huge parts of the picture out of focus, e.g freezing flowers. One of the best and innovative things he did, was to give symbolic materiality to a camera, that doesn't exist with respect to digital image generation. There is a viewing view (Sobchack) that flies through windows, the gigantic clockwork, ... . It is the best Harry Potter picture so far and I hope Newell will follow this path."
999,9,iced flowers,"This is the best of the three Potter-Movies. Cuaron leaves out unimportant details and completely concentrates on the story. The Dursley-Sequence is filmed like an Independent-Movie with the hand-camera, while the scene when Sirius appears the first time as a wolf seems to be part of a Suspense-Horror-Movie. There are no more special effects than necessary - I don't wanna know what George Lucas would have made of it. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson get better and better, but the greatest attraction of the movie is David Thewlis as Professor Lupin - already now my favorite for the Supporting-Role-Oscar. The Soundtrack is another Williams-Masterpiece, which contains a waltz, freejazz, a choir, medieval sounds and a typical Williams-Theme (Buckbeak's Flight). Cuaron even makes references to ""Titanic"" and ""The Hulk"". A brilliant movie, which you can see several times without getting bored."
1000,10,"Thank you, Mr. Cuaron","the prisoner of azkaban is the only potter movie i've seen so far (i always tend to avoid hyped movie series until the biggest hype is gone), and i have to say it was surprisingly well put together. the director obviously knew what he was doing, and the cast is doing a good job too, not to mention everyone at the special effects crew all the way to the end titles...nicely done! always gives me a warm fuzzy feeling to see alan rickman act, too."
1001,8,good potter movie,This is one of my favourite Harry Potter films. I am a huge potter head and I can tell you that this movie made me that way. I loved the first two of course but this one was special. It really sets the stage for the next movies to come and turns the mood into the dark setting it needs to be. The actors are really developing who they are at this point as well. And of course Gary Oldman is in it so how do you not love it!! I HIGHLY recommend this movie and the whole series.
1002,10,A MUST watch,"What a great film!  I was very impressed with this third installment of the series.  I was a little wary, having read some mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Though I had just finished rereading the book and knew what was coming, I found myself startled more than a few times.  What great special effects!  The three actors portraying Harry, Ron, and Hermione have grown quite a bit as actors and have reached a certain level of maturity that is very evident in this film.  For those who haven't read the book, it may be hard to understand some things.  SPOILER:  For instance, someone who didn't read the book wouldn't know what Sirius Black was talking about when he asked Professor Lupin if he had taken his potion that day.  They wouldn't know that Professor Snape was the one who prepared the potion.  There are a lot of things like that left out of the movie, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.  I would have gladly spent a couple more hours in the theater if they had wanted to expand the movie to fill in those gaps because I didn't want it to be over so soon.  I'll just have to see it again! and again! and again!"
1003,10,I didn't want it to be over! (Possible spoiler included),"Book 2 is my least favorite of the books, but this Azkaban was completely ruined by Alfonso Cuarón. He has characters acting out of character and crammed the movie together without sufficient explanation or character development. Most of his ""cute"" bits were just plain stupid."
1004,3,Alfonso Cuarón ruined this movie!,"They have finally made the movie that has the greatest acting in the whole HP series. I liked the plot, and it just followed the book so well."
1005,8,Excellent!,"I was a bit disappointed, as The Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite book, but, inevitably, as we progress into longer and more complicated books, more and"
1006,,"Beautiful trees, yes, but the forest is lacking.","The camera-work and art direction seem much more solid in this film; it is noticeably darker than the previous films. (Although there were a few bright spots, I found the lack of color somewhat overdone.)"
1007,8,Better.,"Don't let the naysayers talk you out of seeing this movie. It is beautifully filmed, with wonderful transitions from scene to scene. "
1008,8,Better then people think,"**SPOILER ALERT** First I would like to apologize for my bad English and possible misspelling. Anyway ... As so many people before me I have read all the books of the Harry Potter Franchise. This particular movie captures almost everything that is essential to the story. I must say that even though late Richard Harris was an outstanding actor (Gladiator, The Count of Monte Cristo ...) I still feel that Michael Gambon is better as Dumbledore. I certainly like the new outfit - Dubledore seems much more elegant. You can notice that Hogwarts is also changed and looks much less fairy tale-like. It is logical that it's practically impossible to capture all the book scenes in one movie. What bothers me most was the scene in the Shrieking shack. It's quite different from the one in the book and I just can't understand why. I think it would be much better if Lupin returned the wands to three young wizards after disarming them and after that Sirius and him would start to explain the real story. Those may be details but in my opinion important ones. "
1009,9,Decent Harry Potter Movie,"Well - after all the hype, i finally went to see the film. Ive read good reviews and bad reviews - i i have to agree with the former."
1010,,Bloody brilliant!!!,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since I started reading the books around 8 years ago. I've seen most of the movies, and this one is by far the best. New characters such as Sirius Black and Remus Lupin are added into the story, and they have important roles in this film."
1011,,Fantastic movie-- best out of all of them.,*Some (very limited) spoilers*
1012,7,So much better than Columbus,I thought that the movie was excellent. It was much better than the previous two which were like book reviews. A madman has escaped Azkaban to supposedly come after Harry. I thought that Gary Oldman was brilliant as Sirius Black. Even Michael Gambon as the new Headmaster Dumbledore was a great role. I actually like him better as Dumbledore than I did Richard Harris.
1013,,"Great movie, if not well explained","i love the harry potter series. i absolutely do, but i have some criticisms of this movie in particular. There were so many things that were changed, unfortunately, for the worse. not that I'm not gonna buy th DVD or anything, its just, when i saw it in theaters....# 1? the scenery. it was the same in the first 2 movies, so it would have been so much better in this one if it had stayed the same. i know that replacing dumbledore had to happen, poor richard harris, but the new one coulda at least tried to sound a little raspier like the old one so that people who didn't know harris had died would find it harder to tell this was a new cast member. and the prophecy... i know they have to cut things out of th story and all, but there is supposed to bee like a month or 2 difference from the day hermione leaves divination til the prophecy. certain things just shouldn't be changed, and certain things must be made with real timing. oh, and peter pedigrew!!! he was fat!!! peter pedigrew is supposed to be a thin and frail, tiny man. yeah, the guy looked like a rat, but he definitely wasn't thin!!!!!and the whole movie just seemed so much darker.... the others had a realistic coloring, this one was just like it was always dark, when thats not the case..."
1014,9,scenery,"why oh why did they they decide to make a wonderfully entertaining and magic set of books into too short, badly acted feature films. I, myself love the books; the way that Rowling manages to create a completely enthralling world of magic and mystery's through the eyes of a young boy, but the films- although they are mildly amusing they are completely ruined by the need to constantly compare them to the books. i realize this is going to be a problem with any book transformed into a film (just look at Alex Garland's The Beach) but its just made even worse by the knowledge that Rowlings books get even longer and the hope that they won't continue to try and fit them all into the regulation 2 1/2 hours. having said all that i do think that this film is the best of the bunch, the new angsty/dark style of Alfonso Cauron make the films more 'realistic' if you can use that word for a wizarding film! The renowned director of Y Tu Mama Tambien really makes his mark on main stream cinema with this sure to be summer blockbuster!"
1015,,why oh why,"I got chills early on in this movie. The acting was that much better than the others. It took a much different direction than the first two movies, being much darker, almost Gothic to a degree, but instead of alienating every the audience and jumping around too quickly, like Van Helsing, I think POA was very engaging and accessible. Disappointments include, the werewolf and Dumbledore not being silly enough. I know that the new guy might have a different interpretation, but I like the goofiness that Richard Harris had brought to the role. I do like how the new dumbledore is a powerful character and we'll see what happens with the next one I guess..."
1016,8,woah,"I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and have read all that have been released so far. However, the last two movies, I have utterly despised because in my opinion they did not capture the real magic of Harry Potter. Instead they were filled with what I like to call ""false innocence"". Chris Columbus made them too childish for my liking, and I seriously thought Daniel Radcliffe was BAD."
1017,,Magical in an amazingly dark way,"At least...something wicked this way comes! finally, a good movie from an Harry Potter books. I live in England at the moment and yesterday I had the possibility to see the pictures. Best things about it: THE DIRECTOR: finally someone that's not scared to change something from the book! Oh don't worry, not BIG changes but that movie isn't only a replicant of the book and this takes the possibility to see the director' s point of view. I don't hate the Columbus' movies but they're TOO stuck on the books! No personality was in the first two movies! THE ACTING: especially daniel Radcliffe, that was very believable, particularly in the anger scenes. Nothing to say about Emma and Rupert: they were good also in the others. Bravo to Gary Oldman and to Twhelis: their characters are well playe by both of them. THE EFFECTS: after the disappointing phoenix of the Chamber I was very frightened about Buckbeak but the special effects team doesn't disappoint me this time. They were also good in creating the Dementors, especially, in making some differences from the Ringwraiths of LOTR THE MUSIC: John Williams knows that something is changed in the story and in the characters so he was able to create some marvellous new theme. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY: the third book is the one where the story grow and it makes in a very dark way...and so the photography of the picture. A very little scene were illuminated by sun; it' s always grey or dark because the story becomes so! This has a reflection also in the location. Hogwarts wasn-'t never so scary! there are also some lacks; I prefer to see more Ron and hermione scenes, especially when the two were quarrel in the books: it's a clear signal of the changing of their feeling for the other one. I hope to explore a little bit more Hogsmeade but this isn't a great mistake. Maybe also the Lumos effect to end a scene is too abused by the director but also this one is a little lack. So enjoy the movie. I gave it an 8/10."
1018,8,Very Good...finally,"I am a HUGE fan of both the Harry Potter books and the films. Prisoner is still my favourite book yet, and consequently I was very much looking forward to the third movie. However, I was thoroughly disappointed. Although I agree that Alfonso Cuarón introduced a much needed darker side of the story of Harry Potter, I found the movie to be lacking in several important aspects introduced in the books. For example the explanation of the Maurders Map, I feel that it was important to explain the connection between the map, James Potter and Harry, which in turn would explain the patronus that Harry produces (in addition the seen with the patronus by the lake could and should have been better). Also, the very short explanation of what occurred between Sirius and Peter should have been longer, it eliminated the character building of Peter, Lupin and Sirius, and did not give the watcher the chance to understand why Harry forgave Sirius so quickly. Also, many of the events were out of order or completely missing, of course the firebolt, the letter of permission for Harry to go to Hogsmede the next year, and the introduction of ""Pig"" Ron's new pet. "
1019,5,Big Disappointment,"I went and saw ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" at midnight this morning. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while, having read the books. Unfortunately, the movie may be a bit of a disappointment to readers of the book. To anyone going to the movie without reading the books, it should still be great. But Cuaron left out a lot of smaller details that should have been involved, taking away a bit of the true charm of the stories... However, Cuaron did a great job at making the movie darker and grittier than the first two. At times, you forget that he's made changes because you're so caught up in the fantastic work on the movie. The acting is especially brilliant, since the kids have matured and we have some great new additions to the cast. Even though he doesn't have much screen time, Gary Oldman does a fantastic job as Sirius Black. Over all, the movie is very good, and I still suggest you see it. Though it may not have everything some readers hope for, it's still fantastic to see it on the screen."
1020,7,Missing a little of the magic...,"Like most other user say, I think this film was passable. It wasn't great. The main concern I have is that Hermione and Ron don't continually fight, then not talk to each other and then make up. "
1021,,Little character development,"I only watched the first two Harry Potter movies because I am in love with Emma Watson. I thought both movies were, otherwise, unwatchable. The Prisoner of Azkaban is different - it has a rational plot and believable adult story line. The star of this movie is Hermoine. She gets all the witty lines and all the good scenes. Emma Watson has improved greatly as an actress. It's truly hard to believe that she was only 12 when they first started filming it(13 in later scenes), she's incredibly mature for her age. Except for a preposterous grab of Harry's shirt in the tree swinging scene, a lack of fear in a werewolf scene, and a silly line regarding Hermoine's hair in a serious moment - the movie is quite believable within its magical boundaries. The time reversing sequences are exceptional with Hermoine taking charge. The intelligent plot twists are an unexpected welcome addition. It is a dark, beautiful, mysterious, and enjoyable film which even adults are welcome."
1022,8,Watchable,"The new director is awesome. Not necessarily for kids.. The dementors kept you on the edge of your seat! I don't know why everyone says harry looks too old for his age. HE'S NOT AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT. Adam Lamberg from Lizzie McGuire was 16/17 and playing a 12/13 year old. It's a trend and true. Look at the people in their same grades in my school. A few have beards and mustaches growing! It's crazy. I loved had much darker it was. Very good! The new director would be wonderful for the fourth movie, but he's not going to direct it :frowns: Professor McGonnagol could have shown up more and some more humor could have been shown, but Ron had me laughing! SO did the shrunken heads. I want to ride the night bus! That rocked! I like how Harry is about the only hot guy there and Hermione is very pretty. The movie is good to not be based on good looking people, no offense because I love every character and wouldn't change them for the world. Good movie!"
1023,10,Loved it!!! =P,"This movie was great! But seeing how Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book it didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I would have been very confused if I hadn't read the book. And some things just p*** me off like how Harry didn't get the firebolt until the end, and how they didn't say who Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs were. But overall it was good. The scene where Lupin turns into a werewolf was great. I pictured him as more of a wolf though. And who else thinks that Ron and Hermione are going to start dating in the seventh or sixth book? I love when Harry blows up Aunt Marge! I'm kinda a Harry Potter addict. This was truly a great film and you should go see it!"
1024,9,Good but not as good as the book.,"I love Harry Potter with all my heart. And I was sooo disappointed after watching this movie! In my opinion changing of the director was not good. OK, J.K. Rowling wanted the reader grow with the book. But is it why the director was changed from the one who was a specialist in filming movies for children to the other who doesn't know a thing about movies for children! Oh, please. This is no longer a movie for the youngsters! All those beautiful landscapes, Hogwarts sooo big... I just don't understand. How can someone do something like this to this GREAT book? So many things are different... I was disguised when I went out of the cinema."
1025,3,"oh, not good at all.","I have read all the Harry Potter novels so far and I saw the first two movies before I watched 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which is definitely the best Harry Potter movie yet. The acting skills of the youngsters improve steadily, the CGI was nice but not breath-taking and there were some tense and exciting moments. Cuarón did a much better job than Columbus, that's for sure."
1026,6,"Best Harry Potter movie yet, but ...","I have watched Harry Potter 1 and 2 previously. Compared to the other two movie, I will say rather critically that Harry Potter was a bit of shock to me as the location of the set was changed. In the two previous movie of Harry Potter, it was set to be very like what the book wrote and I like the effects. However, In Harry Potter 3, in order to like this movie, the book must be forgotten as the plot is switched about and love-at-first-sight can be seen between the Ron and Herimone. The game that is played in the wizard world- one of them was not shown and that is the game where supposely Harry caught the snitch and won the cup. That was not shown as well as the fact that the mouse and cat's attacks. But after all, it is quite 'dark' movie and it is to highlight the power of the show."
1027,10,Fantastic Show..Watch it...,"Harry Potter films are always entertaining but this one fell short of my expectations. I was disappointed that it lacked the charm the first two films produced and fell short mainly due to the plot which just was not well executed. More magical moments, more action and more humor would have made this movie as spellbinding as the first two."
1028,6,Pulled it off? Not Quite,"Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the third film from popcorn culture and entered the realm of true cinema. One might, at first, be taken aback by the washed-out colors and lack of ""wizard clothing"" in favor of more modern ""muggle"" wear, but it somehow works, although I must admit to sorely missing the richness and jewel-like look of the previous two films. The sets and props are darker as well and even Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry takes on an almost dilapidated, sinister look for this scarier installment."
1029,9,"A darker, grungier ""Potter""","Cuaron puts the vision of a great director in the Harry Potter world, and the result is the most enjoyable film of the saga. The photography and design of the wizarding world is a big plus point of the film: simple but with great meaning and substance. However, the transition of the trio to his teenage version seen somewhat forced, botched. Especially in the dialogues and some situations that seem obvious for this purpose. Yet, some scenes featuring the boys have an interesting force. The acting is not the strong point of the film, as many want to believe, but the cadence and the visual art. Cuaron manages to, however, succeed and provide the most interesting film in the series (even for non-fans)"
1030,9,The best Harry Potter movie,"Another amazing, action movie I liked. In this movie, Harry Potter finds out that a mass murderer, who escaped from Azkaban prison and also who is his father's best friend is his Godfather. He who is the godfather of Harry Potter is Sirius Black. "
1031,10,"Another amazing, action movie I liked","It has been said that the new director, Alfonso Cuaron asked the young stars to go away and write an essay on their characters. Emma Watson came back with a 16-page(!) essay on Hermione, Daniel Radcliffe, a 1-page summary on Harry and Rupert Grint didn't even bother handing his in. The point of mentioning this? Well, the film feels as though Cuaron had also asked the screenplay writer to do the same thing with the book and this film is his 1-page summary."
1032,7,The screenplay writer's one-page summary...,"Here's how I feel about Harry Potter, so you know how I align with the fandom:"
1033,10,Best by far,"I need to preface my comments by stating that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter novels, which means my opinion of the films are somewhat colored by my opinion of the books. While I enjoyed ""Sorcerer's Stone"" as both a book and a film, they were both, at heart, stories for children. I thought Chris Columbus did a good job of capturing the essential nature of the book, and I appreciated the effort. I gave ""Sorcerer's Stone"" an 8."
1034,7,Not a step forward for this franchise,"Brilliant This film is magnificent. The best of the three by far. The use of imagination, set design, cinematography, lighting, all wonderful. This film has much more depth than the other three. Cuaron's direction sends the film into a world that is more believable and slightly sinister. Breathtaking sequence after sequence. These kid actors are growing up, and getting good. Emma Watson has matured and lost that annoying girlish whine. After you leave the theater you may wish that the world of Harry Potter would continue. Think about that as the water automatically turns on in the washroom and you read these words off a glowing screen."
1035,8,Brilliant,"I must say that i'm disappointed about the 3rd film. I waited a long time for it and...it wasn't what i expected. 1st, Sirius wasn't at all what i expected. i think he looked old and i thought he wasn't THAT scary..but the acting was good after all. 2nd, the during of the movie was too short. i know it's long sitting for 4 hours in a theater, but if the movie is excellent, we won't"
1036,,disappointed,"Oh dear, what a great disappointment."
1037,7,Butchered the Book,"Don't expect much of the magic, or cute details from the magical life..."
1038,1,Very disappointed - not recommended for any ferret owner.,"Moments after leaving the theater, I was still a little confused to whether I liked the film or not. After a few day of letting it soak in, I realized Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban finally took the series to a whole new level of movie making. Alfonso takes a very huge leap away from the first two movies but the leap was greatly needed. Azkaban finally makes Harry Potter feel like a movie, rather than a book made into a movie. The environments and moods he creates are what really make this film stand out from 1 and 2. The dementors were especially creepy and were done perfectly. Azkaban shines in all of the areas it's predecessors were weak and Alfonso has improved on the already strong foundations left by Columbus. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban receives a 10/10."
1039,10,Alfonso Cuarón is just want Harry Potter needed!,This is ridiculous. Hasn't it occurred to them to do the whole Volumes 1 and 2 like Tarrantino did for Kill Bill? They are cutting out HUGE amounts of information and not even bothering to explain how/why certain characters are aware of what they do know. Newsflash! The books are getting longer! It's only going to get worse...
1040,,Too Short,"If you are one of those HP fans who list every departure from the books, don't watch this this film, it will only infuriate you and ruin the whole experience. You want the unchanged story? Read the book, it's excellent."
1041,8,movie magic,"despite that the cinema was crammed to the ceiling with magic loving 7 year olds! this movie was really enjoyable! daniel radcliffe is still a bit overly dramatic at the wrong times, but emma watson and rupert grint are much improved from the kiddish rompings of the philosopher's stone!"
1042,9,worth a visit to the multiplex!,"*possible spoiler, no detail though, spoiler ends at end, where it say s ""***end spoiler***""*Much like every sequel this one was by far inferior to its prequels. The movie started out with Harry using a wand in the middle of summer and continued by uncle Vernon telling him about five minutes later that he's not allowed to. Then the movie continues it's wonderful streak of mess-ups by making it clear that they're skipping out the first few chapters and condensing everything before the eventful dinner into less than two minutes. After that when Harry gets on the night bus it doesn't make objects jump out of the way, it just goes out of the way itself, through aids of time-warping magic. Shortly after harry has a Quidditch game in GOGGLES, where a few people are hit by thunder during which dementors come FLYING in. They mess up the order of all of the events, cutting out many completely and at times inserting ones that were never there. The scene with Lupin turning into a werewolf was completely ruined, along with the imitation of the werewolf. "
1043,5,A disappointment and a 4-5,"Saw the film yesterday. Aspects of it were very interesting - but they rearranged and left out very important markers in the movie. The don't celebrate Christmas - just kind of keep going - don't even mention it. There are other things I was disappointed in but that would spoil it. The acting was really good - and the effects are wonderful. I would just hate to see the effects over shadow the story, or ""carry"" the story. The kids have really grown up! Especially NEVILLE! The score was also very good, but don't bother staying to the end of the credits - nothing fun at the end and they go on FOREVER. Maybe the next time I see it I'll like it more...."
1044,,Very different,"MOSHI MOSHI. I have to give props to the new director for taking on a continuing movie series first of all. That being said, he made a few... let me rephrase that a lot of mistakes. Coming from a book fan, the first two movies were splendid, however The Prisoner was a movie I have mixed feelings for. The got the main points were covered, but a lot of detail was looked over. My main beef with the detail was the lack of explaining Harry's fathers relationship with Lupin, Black, and Pettigrew. If you havn't read the books you cannot appreciate the marauders map as much, and you might be confused as to why Lupin knew how to use it. They did not explain who Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs were. That erked me hardcore. However the hippogriff was done above my expectation. Without the hippogriff I may not have liked the movie at all. Fabulous Casting. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and Emma Thompson as Proff. Trelawny, exactly how I pictured them. Michael Gambon did his best at Dumbledore, however no one will ever replace Richard Harris, an all time classy guy and a beautiful dumbledore. But the neglect to Rowlings detail makes this my least favorite Harry Potter movie yet. I look forward to The Goblet of Fire (my all time favorite Harry Potter Book) due in November 2005. I do suggest that Harry Potter Fans go see it, but take heed when taking children with you, the dementors might be a little scary. Oh yeah, one more thing. THE EXPELLIARMUS SPELL WAS REALLY WEAK AND THE PATRONUS CHARM IS SUPPOSE TO BE A STAG!!! GET IT RIGHT. BUT THE HIPPOGRIFF WAS COOL BETTER THAN DOBBY. IT WAS REALLY COOL. ***what the bloody hell was that all about***"
1045,,Harry Potter POA; Too many changes???*may contain spoilers*,Wow!! Thanks Alfonzo!! He does great justice to all of the people we have come to love. Michael Gambon does a great job with staying true to Dumbledore. Only one thing you should be aware of..If you are an avid Harry Potter fan and know the books forwards and backwards like myself (my husband say I need a support group) know that some key things are missing. I would have liked to see the explanation of some of the plot twist. But overall it is an excellent film and I know that if everything in the book was in the movie then we would be sitting in the theater for about five hours. Overall this was a great film and definitely worth the time standing in line and worth the 20 bucks. I just wanted so much more.
1046,8,Excellent film but could I have more,"OK, granted, this was a long, complicated book, thus it was challenging to condense it into a 2 hour movie, but there was very limited character development. The whole movie just felt rushed, from the very first minute, and it made the entire movie a bit confusing. The dialogue was so fast that the acting seemed poor. Basically this was a 2 hour movie that needed to be closer to 3 hours. And if they felt that they could not make the movie much longer, they should have cut out superfluous scenes such as the singing with the giant toads, or the part where Harry is flying around on Buckbeak's back (which frankly, looked so cliché and ""titanic-esque"" that everyone in the theatre laughed). Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew are very important characters, especially in later books (and subsequently movies) but they were not fully developed. I don't think it was even clear that they, in addition to Harry's father, James, created the Marauders's Map. The Prisoner of Azkaban was shot in a very different way from the first two movies. You can definitely tell this was a different director. Instead of focusing on the individual, it was ""bigger."" You get to see more of the Hogwarts' grounds, which was great. And this movie was funnier than the previous two. I also really enjoyed seeing the relationship develop between Hermione and Ron! I did not care for the new Dumbledore, Michael Gambon. He did not have Richard Harris's warmth, which portrayed Dumbledore's light-hearted humor. Gambon's humor was sardonic, and just did not make Dumbledore as likable."
1047,7,Harry Potter on speed,"I must say that the third Harry Potter movie was greatly disappointing. However, I won't write a lengthy review pointing out how the changes from the book detracted from the film, as I'm sure this has been pointed out (I agree btw). Anyhow, I couldn't help feeling that this film seemed somewhat disjointed, or choppy--The story line did not flow from beginning to end as it did in the first two films. I can't help but blame this on a poor screenplay and the new director's inability. The entire film just seemed a bit cheesy and poorly planned out. I assumed that reading the books and expecting a faithful adaptation caused my dislike for this film; however, my brother who has not read the novels felt similarly (actually he rated the movie worse than I). All in all, I felt the first two Harry Potter films were quite good; whereas, the third is simply AVERAGE (at best)."
1048,2,Not impressed,"Where do I begin? Well, I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series. I have read it entirely around 4 times! Prisoner Of Azkaban was one of my favourites (The other is the 4th one). So, when the movie released, I naturally went for it First Day First Show. But I was let down badly."
1049,,The biggest disappointment of 2004,I had to comment after seeing this film. *CONTAINS SPOILERS*
1050,10,A must see!,"I absolutely love this story and the books by J.K. Rowling but every time I see the next Harry Potter movie, something inside of me aches. I remember reading these books and feeling so surprised at the turn of events, but when you see it in a movie, it just seems so much more obvious. When (SPOILER) Harry sees someone across the lake conjuring the patronus, he assumes it's his father, but in the movie, it's so much more obvious that it's actually him! I mean, things such as Scabbers and Buckbeak and the Time Turner (to name a few) were so much more magical and surprising in the book. In the movie, they seem...well..mundane. I wish they would go into more details, I would still see these movies if they were three or four hours long! Intermissions, hello?! Titanic pulled it off! Stop sacrificing the story and magic for time and expenses. I'm so afraid of what's going to happen to the ""Goblet of Fire"". This book is over twice as long as the previous three. I must say, the direction in this movie has been my favorite, though. He took some liberties and changed a few things, but he knew which things could be changed, and which to leave alone. To wrap up and reiterate what I've said (because it's killing me) please, let the characters speak more and explain everything. It was so much better in the book when we finally saw Petunia explode, because she was so mean and awful to Harry. In the movie, she says approx. three mean comments and BOOM! Harry loses it. It just doesn't cut it. Let Harry, Ron and Hermione become vivid characters, not merely the shells of who we've read about. Take your time, Hollywood! (Or the British equivalent of Hollywood...lol) These are movies, not Cliffs Notes."
1051,,From someone who loved the books,"Apparently, Peter Jackson (and Mel Gibson for that matter) have not gotten their point across to Hollywood. (After seeing POA I'm not sure they ever will). Why is it so difficult to understand that if a story is well known and has a strong fan base, people will be willing to spend not only their money, but their time to see it. Didn't POTC prove this (in another language no less)? Didn't LOTR prove this? Three times?"
1052,,Sigh!,----SPOILERS ALERT-----
1053,7,BRING BACK COLUMBUS (Spoilers),*SPOILERS*
1054,9,The magic still lives,SPOILERS
1055,10,Third Time's The Charm...,"I went to the midnight showing of HP and I thought it was fantastic! The special effects left the other movies far behind. I thought Michael Gambone did a very good Dumbledore, though it was different. The pace of the movie seemed faster, and it was shorter, yet it still managed to capture the main points of the book. I had high expectations for this movie, b/c Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the books, and I'm happy to say that it met them. I wasn't sure if I could see Gary Oldman as Sirius, but he played it well. Oh, and if I hear one more person say this was a ""darker"" movie, I will scream! The book itself was darker than the others before it, and all of the books become increasingly darker as Harry grows up. By making the film have a darker tone, the filmmakers have tried to be true to the books and I feel they succeeded."
1056,10,Better than the rest,"The movie I waited for finally hit the screens, I waited for it for 1,5 years, and I can honestly say that it was worth waiting for a whole 100%!"
1057,,"Something wicked this film is... (In a good way, though!)","I enjoyed this movie much better than the first two Harry Potter movies. I will have to completely disagree with the people who said that if you have read and loved the books, this movie will disappoint you. I am huge fan of the books, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series."
1058,10,Great movie!,"I simply cannot believe they have done it again. Even after switching directors and creating a more serious tone for the movie (perfect for Alan), the people making Harry Potter continue to underuse one of the most important characters in the movie. In the first two combined, I doubt Rickman had 20 minutes of on screen time. What makes the third even more tragic is the fact that all of the Harry Potter trailers were FILLED with images of Alan Rickman, but again, Snape fans get the shaft. What is the use of hiring these intelligent and highly trained and talented British actors if they're only in the film for 10 minutes, especially after showing those trailers. It was like sitting through a ballet after you thought you bought tickets to a comedy show: you feel robbed and p***ed throughout. For Shame."
1059,,Same Formula: Underuse of Rickman,"With a lot of enthusiasm I start writing this comment. Potter 3 is again a superior release, with all the ingredients needed. The story continues in a sturdy manner, the characters grow, as the actors do as well. And I notice that we as an audience are spoiled to the bone. Spoiled by the overwhelming specials effects as we've seen in 1 and 2, now we almost would take them for granted in this third edition. The whole surrounding in which the story takes place seems so natural and normal, what is at the same time a huge compliment to the makes of this picture, as they can convince us in believing the craftsmanship of special effects.  The story, just as the book, brings the viewer to a new dimension in the saga. And everything in this story matches as a glove, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat till the end. Also the new but familiar faces in the cast are a nice surprise, and very well fitted in. "
1060,,We're spoiled!,I cannot contain my disappointment with the movie - and this is the most damning comment considering I have not even read the book to be disappointed with its (apparent) lack of fidelity.
1061,,YYYyyyyyaaaaawwwwwwn!,I just saw the travesty that was supposed to be the jewel of the Harry Potter series. I don't know where they got the director from but it was the biggest mistake ever. I loved the book and very much disliked this movie.
1062,,WHAT WAS ONCE GOLD IS NOW LEAD,"I really liked the first two films, so when i heard about the change in director i had my doubts. Unfortunately they were mostly correct. I'm a huge fan of the books, and this third film did not follow the book very well. The best part of the movie were the special effects if you ask me. The casting of Trelawny was awesome! She looked exactly as I pictured her in my head. Pettigrew on the other hand, looked so much like a rat, it was unrealistic. He was totally different from what I imagined. Further, there were so many accents on minor details,that bigger parts of the story were left out. I understand that they can't film the entire book, but really. Things I missed: no mention of who Prongs, Moony, Wormtail and Padfoot are. No end of year banquet and no train home. I also missed the sorting hat. (Harry and Hermione miss the sorting, I know, but why do we have to watch that choir sing?????) The film focused too much on the Dementors and other stupid scenes, like the Womping Willow-scene. I'm not interested in a tree swinging its branches, I want to see Harry's Firebolt at Christmas (not at the end) and more Quidditch!! Some of the special effects were pretty useless, like the headless hunters. There is no mention of them in the story, so why cast them?? Just leave them out entirely if you don't want to mention them. What also annoyed me, was the fact that teachers (like Snape and Mcgonagal, who I loved in the first movies) were almost completely missing in this movie. Perhaps this was because the students have hardly any classes. It's a school! Students tend to attend classes there. (strange isn't it?) And what happened to the castle?? Did the old one fall down or something? There was this huge clock i hadn't seen before, the gardens were all weird and there was a bridge to go to Hagrids. Come on people, places don't change that much. The fact that the actors have grown doesn't really disturb me, because they grow older in the books too. The new Dumbledore was OK too. So all in all, i didn't really liked this movie. I really wanted to see it and I felt a bit disappointed when I left. Hopefully the next movie will be better (stick to the book guys!)."
1063,,Mixed feelings,"People who have seen the third harry potter film will be surprised by the sudden change of tone and direction taken to create a dark and mysterious film unlike a happy family related movie. The first time i seen it i really didn't like it because of that but as the other harry potter films were released, they all sucked. So in retrospect this makes the third much better. I am not saying i like it because the others sucked but the more you watch it and compare, you will like it. As a 10 year old kid, i was hyped with harry potter, having read all the books, owning a lot of merchandise and knowing all bout the classic books. I was mad into it. I needed something to get into after the end of the lord of the rings (with one more star wars and more hp, things started looking great for me as a kid)."
1064,9,Different from the first two...but in a good way.,"This film is the third instalment in the Harry Potter series, following on from the Philosophers Stone (2001) and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) I went to the cinema on the day it came out, expecting the film to be better than the first two. How wrong I was. "
1065,5,Some parts are very disappointing,"This Harry Potter was really good. I enjoyed watching it and the plot was just as interesting as the first two. It followed the book and it was very well put together. But this movie was different from the first two movies. This one felt more...""dark."" I think this may be because of the plot, and how disturbing it is to Harry, so I think that is why it's different from the other two Harry Potter movies. The acting was a lot more dramatic in this movie. I think the events of the story engage this more dramatic acting. I was extremely impressed by all the actors and seen how they've improved from the previous films. All in all this movie was great. I recommend it to all Harry Potter fans."
1066,8,Good but different,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third instalment of the impressive Harry Potter series. This blows the first two films out of the water. I can't believe it was the least successful Potter movie! Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Harry Potter, finally getting used to being the talk of the planet. Rupert Grint again is wonderful as Ron Weasley. Emma Watson is great as clever Hermione Granger, who has mysteriously turned into a spunky character."
1067,10,Best Film of the Series So Far,"The first two Potter films were not bad movies. On the contrary, they were ""pretty good"". Of course, they were following Rowling's excellent stories as close as humanly possible within the span of a motion picture, so that does a lot to explain why they don't entirely suck."
1068,9,Takes Columbus' mundanity and turns it into magic,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is part of the highest caliber in literature. One that not only appeals to every age group; but shines with an excellent storyline full of plot twists and imagination. This book is part of the current most popular book series that has possibly ever existed. It is expected that the film interpretation of this book would be critically acclaimed with cleverness and great appeal to all audiences. Unfortunately this is not the case.
1069,6,A decent film but still lacking,"A real disappointment if you're a true fan of the books. If you don't read the books or didn't completely follow the previous movies, it'll be confusing. It was well-directed and really looked like the Hogwarts the books portray, but the acting is terrible and the plot-line is hard to follow. The movie has been built up to be a comedy and teen romance flick, where the plot line is thrown to the side, into the background, making it difficult to understand."
1070,5,Harry goes back for his third year at Hogwarts and learns that a murderer is at large and after Harry.,"I'll keep this review short since the movie came out more than a decade ago and it has been universally viewed. 5 movies came after this one in the series and 2 movies came before, yet Prisoner of Azkaban still remains my favorite (and many peoples') Harry Potter movie. This movie is the one of the few in the franchise that tells and completes a story. It deals with Harry uncovering a truth about his past involving his parents' murder, and explores how he adjusts to this truth. Here's what makes that sentence special: was there any mention of Voldemort in that summary? You'd be hard pressed to find any mention of him either in the movie, except in a couple sentences. This movie can be seen as separate from the rest of the Harry Potter movies because it holds up as its own, without having to build up the universe or service the Voldemort storyline at all. It's also the first movie to feature the dark undertones that the first two implied but never fully explored. He must deal with his darkest fears while also dealing with the danger of a murderer seeking to kill him. This is more personal, but this movie ironically deals with time travel better than any sci fi movie I've seen about it because it portrays it in a way that time is immutable, which makes the most sense."
1071,9,The first one in the series made for grown-ups and kids,"A much better plot, and excellent acting by the three pupils - probably because they are now older and therefore more capable - makes this the best of the series so far."
1072,8,Best so far,"I quite enjoyed the third Harry Potter movie. It was perhaps somewhat silly during the first 30 minutes, but the film grows darker and more interesting."
1073,8,Quite good movie but with one huge flaw (major spoiler),"I found this third Harry Potter film to be plenty of fun, good story telling, and decent acting all around. The kids are certainly older, but they still work well enough together, and in some ways their transformations give us something new and fresh to enjoy. The new (to the movies) characters are all fine too. The animation has certainly kept up with the times - Hogwarts is more alive than ever, and Buckbeak is a sight to behold."
1074,7,"Fine film, but I found the music lacking","If you haven't read the book, this movie will most likely baffle you at several points. If you have read the book, you'll wonder why they cut as much as they did. The movie could have sustained another 20-30 minutes without becoming excessively long, and the scenes which were cut would have made it a much more cohesive and enjoyable film."
1075,7,"Too much cut, too little left",In short -- it's beautiful. Further -- I feel great pain and sorrow to know that the remaining Harry Potter's will not be directed by the one who should've done them all: Alfonso Cuarón. I don't think I can ever watch another Harry Potter film (old or new) again. :-(
1076,10,What a wonderful film,"I have read all the books so far, and enjoyed all the films so far. I didn't fault the first two films for their almost slavish loyalty to the books. This film, however, made more judicious cuts and a few more slight alterations, and I think it is to be commended for it. This is the first in the series that was truly and adaptation, rather than a transcription. As the books get longer, you can expect more changes as the series gets on, to get each story down to a manageable movie length."
1077,10,A good adaptation,In the first part of the movie the lightning scar was over the left eye. >From the Quidditch match onward the scar was over the right eye.
1078,,possible goof,Very faithful adaptation of the book but overall unsatisfying addition to the series. Radcliffe and Watson continue to grow into their roles but Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley has lost his charm. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are utterly wasted with almost no screen time to develop their characters.
1079,6,Good adaptation,"If you have not previously read the books, do so before watching, else you shall be even more confused by a film that misses out so much background that it fails to develop the plot correctly."
1080,5,"Alfonso makes a good effort, yet fails to stay faithful to the books.","And I was impressed. By far the best Potter movie up till now. Great story trustworthy characters and convincing special effects. I'll give the movie 7/10, it really caught my attention and watched in suspension. "
1081,7,"I watch movies, no books on film!","***may contain spoilers*** I must say that I was rather disappointed with this film. This is my favorite book out of the series, and I was expecting the movie to be as well. I might have been expecting too much, but I just didn't like the movie very much."
1082,3,Not the best of the 4 movies,"I have to say this is the worst out of all of them in my opinion, but it is still a good movie. I think that this movie is the least exciting, and is the only one that doesn't have much involving Voldemort which i think is what made this a tad less interesting. I also didn't like the demetors but some how it seemed like they were taking the place of voldemort(besides Serious black). What i personally thought was the best part of this movie was when Hermionie punched Malfoy in the face, that was the best part of this movie to me. So to conclude my comment i have to say that it was kind of a let down to the other Harry potter movies but still a good movie"
1083,10,A good movie but it does not capture the essence of the first two,"Was a solid book adaptation, was true enough to the book that I could enjoy a 2-hour version of what could be managed to fit into it."
1084,7,Always a reader first,"Where do i even start...this movie may be good for those that have not read the books. But this movie really needs to be redone. Does JK Rowling not care about her fans anymore how could she approve this movie... They cut out so much stuff, like you know Christmas....and lots of others things...if you have read the books you will hate this movie as a Harry Potter movie, it makes a good movie just not a harry potter movie, they need to get the old director back this one must not have read any of the harry potter books or was just so high on his horse he thought he could change every little detail and add pointless crap...if you liked harry potter especially the 3rd one which was my favorite book do not watch the movie...i have to re-read the book because the movie was so bad...actually go see it and then we should all write jk rowling a big letter about it i give the movie as a harry potter movie a 1/10 but as a movie a 7/10"
1085,1,How Bad can this get? 1/10,I loved this film and I just can't get it out of my head.
1086,10,10/10 stars,"This is a wonderful movie. It's very gripping and the special effects are beyond brilliant. It's much darker than the first two, and we are introduced to three new characters, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Professor Trelawney. Oldman, Thewlis and Thomson deliver fantastic performances as the three newcomers... The Dementors are crossovers of Wraiths and dark ghosts, and they left much of the audience in awe. Even though the director left out quite a few of the parts from the book, this movie doesn't disappoint at all. It's fun, and it really captures the imagination of even those who aren't Harry Potter fans. I just hope the Goblet of Fire is half as good as this one was - I'll be very satisfied indeed."
1087,10,Something Wicked This Way Comes...,***SPOILERS***
1088,,"Almost great, but lacking explanation and continuity","Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is indeed the best movie in the trilogy. This is obviously because of the switch of director from Chris Columbus to Afonso Curalon, and it is because of Curalon's impressive directing style that almost every aspect of the production is better, from the acting (especially from the kids) to the costumes (the students only wear their uniforms during classes, and outside classes they dress like normal teen agers)to the score, (Personally, I think The Chamber of Secrets score was just a mish mash of themes from The Sorcere's stone). Also this film gives Gary Oldman, one of my favorite actors, an incredible comeback and a great performance. Very good movie, lets just pray that the series continues this successful turn."
1089,,New director = better movie,"First off, I am a Harry Potter fan and have read all of the books, through and through. I own the first two movies, and I think they did a good job in portraying the story and being faithful to J.K. Rowling. The third installment of Harry Potter was, to me, a disappointment. With a new director, Alfonso Cuaron, at the helm, the movie undertook a new feel that I didn't care for. I understand that the books keep on getting darker, but Chris Columbus gave Chamber a much darker tone than Sorceror's Stone without changing the atmosphere of the Harry Potter saga. Cuaron wrecked it with his rapid fire paced scenes. True, this book had a lot more to dive into, but the pace of the scenes throws you from scene to scene before you can take in what just happened. Also, the new Dumbledore doesn't capture the character as did Richard Harris, which made me feel that it was an entirely new character rather than Dumbledore."
1090,,Zoom zoom zoom,"If these movies keep getting better, the academy of motion pictures will eventually have to recognize them . . . Nah,will never happen. But just remember, the same critics that panned, downplayed, or just plain ignored Star Wars back in 1976, are today using it as a benchmark movie. I like Epert and Ropers comparison to these movies (specifically Chamber) to the Wizard of Oz. They definitely are succeeding in creating Rowlings world for us to visually enjoy. "
1091,,Doesn't let us down.,"On its own, this movie was good. But for the large majority of people who have read the book, and/or seen the other two films, this was a letdown in my opinion. This does not mean it was a complete failure, or even anything close to it. I still enjoyed it very much. However, this film (unlike the other two) strayed from the book at several places (some of them major). I have read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it, and having the movie leave out or change so many parts was very disappointing. Also, I felt that the story was very rushed and fragmented. It jumped from scene to scene with little or no transition. It wasn't until the climactic ending portion that it actually elaborated on anything. Finally, I agree with the people who say the the new director has seriously cut back on the sense of magic and wonderment which was found in the first two. It's focused too much on the story (the much altered, and choppy one at that) to pay much attention to any ""frills"", which are much needed in a movie like this one."
1092,8,"Good, but not great","I should start by saying that I really enjoyed the film. As many people are saying, it is a little bit more ""mature"" and even ""dark"" than the first two, a transition which I think worked out fairly well (though I still appreciate the first two for their own value). My biggest impression was that it really grabbed me at first (partially from having noticed the changes in style), but wasn't quite as exciting at the end. I was really looking forward to seeing Gary Oldman's performance, but was slightly disappointed to see that he wasn't in too much of the film. What part he did play, though, was quite good. I should also probably note that I say all of this having not read the book, so I don't really have any complaints as to what was left out, etc., and I'm inclined to think that it's probably better that way. I gave it an 8."
1093,8,"Maybe a little bit of lag towards the end, but very enjoyable.","Personally, I don't really like any films based on the books, and I don't even enjoy first two Harry Potter films. However, this film really impressed me by the director's amazing talents. Of course, no film is as the same as the book, but the film delivered great elements for people to enjoy watching. I give it 8 out of 10 for everything all together."
1094,,Impressive!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of both the Harry Potter movies, as well as the books written by acclaimed author J.K. Rowling. This movie was directed by Alfonso Cuaron, whereas the first two films were directed by Chris Columbus, and I find there is quite a bit of a difference--a very good one."
1095,10,A truly magical movie experience! *may contain spoilers*,"An excellent adaptation, with the necessary darker feel to it from the first two films. The cast keeps improving with each film, although Daniel Radcliffe still struggled with the emotional outbursts - ""He was their friend and he betrayed them"" a little cringe-making. Also, Draco was far too afraid too quickly of Hermione in the fight scene - good punch though. I don't think this was a fault in the actor, but rather a fault in the direction."
1096,8,Excellent although flawed - contains spoilers,"Well I want to start out by saying, this is a constructive criticsm of the movie... not saying it was horrible. I did kinda liked it. but here are my criticsms."
1097,,"Book3 was my fave book, but.... (Spoilers)","OK, first off, those of you who have read the books and are complaining that the movie doesn't follow the book, you all need to settle down and back off. Who cares if the movie didn't follow the book. The movie isn't a direct copy of the book, that would take too long and would cost much, much more. Instead, the movie, like most adaptations of books, is merely based on the book. Who cares that there wasn't as much Quidditch or there weren't as many fights between Ron and Hermione. It's only a movie, strictly for entertainment purposes. They weren't competing for a special reward for following the book word for word. YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN FILM!!! There are some things that are better expressed as actual objects instead of just words on a page. "
1098,9,the best potter movie yet,"All in all, I would give this movie 4 stars (out of 5) if taken by itself. Compared to the first two, I would give it only 3 stars. Now here is why..."
1099,,"Shame, shame, shame...","I was very very surprised with the quality of this movie. Cuaron is just what the series needed, he is fantastic director,I don't mind the changes in the Griffindor entrance, or the location of W. Willow or Hagrid's Hut, or the fact that Harry got his Firebolt at the end of the term or other situations of the book that got the ax because of time limitations. I say that those arguments against the movie are miscellaneous, even when I adore the books and in fact have read them 5 times each. The scenery, the special effects are better, the camera angles, the movie is funnier, darker, and much more enjoyable to watch and it is not only because the story is better. Well yes the story is much better than the previous books but Cuaron had a lot do with the fact that The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 3. Also, I have to add the magnificent cast who were perfect in every way in their portrayals, Dan Radcliffe(Harry), Emma Watson(Hermione), Rupert Grint(Ron), Gary Oldman(the Prisoner), Maggie Smith(Prof. Minerva M.), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), David Thewlis(Lupin) and even Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) for which I had reservations(because I wanted another actor who portrayed another wizard ""Gandalf"") but he was also very good and exceeded my expectations just as the movie has. I give this movie a 10 and hope Cuaron does come back to direct the Order of the Phoenix or one of the other remaining stories and I also hope for no more changes in the actors PLEASE the series would never be the same if they change any of the actors who portray the main characters."
1100,10,WOW!!!,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series (so far), so I must admit that I was anxious to see this movie. Though there were scenes that I would have liked to see from the book, I loved this movie. The imagery in terms of the dementors was excellent, they were scarier even then I thought they would be. "
1101,10,"Favorite Book, Loved The Movie","What can I say? I'm a book fan and I loved it. There are the ones who hate it, the ones who love it and the ones who shrug and live with it. The only annoying thing when you like a movie is have people forcing down on you the ""But it was horrible!"" oh well, to each its own, right? Let me love it and I'll let you hate it and we can all live happily ever after."
1102,,I love it,"There was absolutely nothing wrong with the first two Harry Potter films, and Chris Columbus did an admirable job of capturing much of the feel of the first two books after which they were made. But Book Three, Prisoner of Azkaban, started on a darker path, and here is where a change of mood was required. No longer does Hogwarts look like a Disney film, but rather like the medieval castle it is. Cuaron sees the world of Wizardry and Witchcraft for what it is, that is, essentially Middle Ages in aspect. Wizards' homes have no electricity, none of the regular modern amenities, and their world, even as Rowling paints it, is more like the Dark Ages. Rowling herself advised Cuaron that while the first two films followed the books faithfully, they lacked the spark of creative storytelling quite necessary to take the much larger book and pare it down into a couple of hours. Others have written that the story felt rushed, but that is a tribute to the complexity of Rowling's story. Ask a person who has not read the book what they think of ""Prisoner"" and I think you'll find they followed it very well. In thinking about this, I too felt that the set-up for the ""three turns"" time twist was a bit weak, but only because Rowling reiterates it so often in the book. This is really unnecessary for the film, and the few references in the middle of the film work quite nicely."
1103,,"Finally, a Harry Potter movie not just for kids.","I'm not particularly a fan of Harry Potter, although I understand the over-hype and fever thats hit the young impressionable youths of the world. The movies are always just a little over-rated due to the expectancy of them. Yet regardless of this they remain entertaining with a good contrast of British cast with only a few exceptions (Oldman). I acknowledge Gary Oldman as a good actor for his diversity of roles (Murder In The 1st - 5th Element) and he plays his role very well in this. Daniel Radcliffe is a bit weak in the lead and although it is a role that carries pressure with it hand in hand he does his best. Radcliffe for his age is not a bad actor but not a very good one, the same could be said for his counterparts (Grint and Watson). Although this cannot be overcome the fact the cast is mainly youngsters takes a chip of the overall acting quality as none of them are outstanding, and few satisfactory. The movie is made primarily for youngsters, the dark contrast of Cuaron's directing clashes with this leaving a mixed mood of film. This is not always a bad thing but for something that should be consistent its a disadvantage. Grint adds some comic relief whilst Watson looks good for the young men watching. The Potter films are average in an ever growing fantasy genre but will be forgotten soon after the hype which is catapulting it to such success that the second movie is the third highest grossing. Then again Titanic wasn't the greatest piece of film art, when putting any Harry Potter film next to any Lord of The Rings film it puts into context the sheer mediocrity of the Potter films, only catapulted to such extreme success due to the volatile and fickle interests of a young and naive audience. Overall, entertaining if your into fantasy, average if your not. 6.7/10"
1104,6,"A Treat For Fans, Mediocre For Others",Possible Spoilers herein
1105,8,Best Harry POtter Film,"Wow! This one's really good, by far the best of the three Harry Potter movies. Criticising a film based on a book is always difficult. After all, there are two ways to look at it: you can compare it with the book, or you can look at it forgetting about the book and rate is as a film as such (which, of course, is almost impossible if you have read the book). This one turns out very good either way. Whereas in The Chamber of Secrets it looked like possibly all the wrong choices had been made concerning what to include and - most of all - what to exclude from the film, here this very difficult task is done perfectly. The film would become a couple of hours longer if the director should choose to include everything (we're not even talking about the next two parts...), so you have to make choices. And yes, this means that a lot about the classes, the yearly competition, the frictions between our main characters, Hagrid's creatures, the trips to Hogsmeade etc is left out, the director concentrates on the plot. And this he does in an excellent way. Although it is a rather complicated story, it is brought to you as clear as, well, anything. Even the time travel part, which is done perfectly. OK, one remark: the whole story about Potter sr and his friends could or should have gotten a little more attention and explication. There are a couple of points where the film deviates from the book, but always in a supportive and OK manner. Two more compliments. Harry Potter in the books starts to become a more and more annoying teenager, not to say an insufferable jerk (is it adult's eyes reading a children's book?); here there's nothing of that, he remains sympathetic all the way. Although I must say that this gets worse especially in the next books, and certainly in the Phoenix-one. Secondly, and more important. I hate - and I mean HATE - digital effects. That has got nothing - and I repeat myself: NOTHING - to do with making a film. Just a cheap trick, and that was a bad (and commercial) band in the seventies already... Of course it's unavoidable here, and I must say that it is done in a brilliant way. The effects really are perfect. Well, you can see it is fake (how could you not?), but it's not disturbing, even nice to see. So even as you look at it as just a film and forget about the book it's a pleasure to watch. Can't imagine that little children have any fun when watching it, though. But that is not my problem..."
1106,9,Excellent!,"Wow. I love the new direction. The style fits the movie perfectly. I also think the kids acted much better in this one. I really hope they don't get rid of Daniel Radcliff, even if he does get too broad in the shoulders. You can't swap horses mid-stream. Also, did anyone recognize the kid who played Neville at first? The biggest problem that I had was that there were a lot of things the movie didn't explain, such as ""Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs."" I think that it may have been hard for those who hadn't read the book to understand. It also didn't show that Harry's Patronus was a stag, which I thought was important. And Harry's eyes aren't green (which is mentioned at least once in each book), but that's a minor thing. I felt that the style fits the book well. I go back and read the first book and think ""Wow, how young they all are, how naive."" The books age, and I think that comes out in this movie. I hope they continue to follow the same path."
1107,6,Wow,This is definitely the best Harry Potter movie to date. I am actually quite surprised that this film got by the MPAA with only a PG rating (It really feels like it should have been PG-13.) And that's a good thing. Cuaron's direction is much darker than Columbus' previous two and the three main leads seem more comfortable in there roles than ever before. The performances are much stronger and the subject matter is much more developed than what we've come to expect from this franchise. Cuaron's transitions between scenes and the note on which he ends the film (Does anyone remember freeze-frames?) really add to the visual style and in my opinion give the film a much more ominous impact. Not to mention that there is barely a frame in this film with any sunlight (Think Tim Burton's Batman.) The end result is a very engrossing and entertaining mainstream film that will be enjoyed by even the most sophisticated moviegoer but may actually scare the little ones a bit!
1108,8,Best of three.,"The color palette of this movie is cold and spooky, starting from the metallic WB logo at the outset. The use of silver and gray made the film look sharp and less over-blown than the first two in the series. "
1109,,Harry Stunning in Silver,"I just saw Harry Potter 3. Wow, a lot of changes, in a good way. First off, Daniel Radcliffe's acting is still as crappy as usual, but not as bad as Malfoy. The thing that amazed me the most was the very different style of cinematography, which is dark, grainy, and much better than Columbus's boring Directing. You can definitely see the change. Well, unfortunately this movie started off a little slow. I felt like there was a lot of missing material and was a bit to short (142 min), considering how big the book is. There was not as much action or comedy in this installment which left it a bit bland. Bottom line is: Slower than the other HPs, better Directing, still crap acting (Daniel Radcliffe). This may be worth seeing if your family takes you, otherwise not. Much better quality than the other HPs. 7/10"
1110,7,Much better style than the others.,THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
1111,10,Feel thoroughly pleased.,"Well, I am not a great Harry Potter Fan. I watched the first two movies, because everybody of my friends had watched it. So these two movies were o.k.. The first was interesting because of this magical world full of wizards etc.. The second wasn't as good as the first one, but too long from my point of view. So I went to see this one with no great expectations. Only because of a cheap offer of the cinema I watched this film. And then it came."
1112,,Best of all (Spoilers)!,"Anyone who disses this movie is clearly a bitter lord of the rings fan or too proud to want to like it. The actors have grown into their roles so much more, and even though Rupert Grint's character Ron hasn't grown much, Rupert definitely has grown as an actor and is clearly the most natural of the three leads. And as much as i HATE Emma Watson, even she is really good in this film, making you forget about the ham she was in the first two. The biggest improvement however is in Daniel Radcliffe, who has improved incredibly and even drew tears in his emotional scenes from may in the audience. Tom Felton is also particularly good as Draco, and I think he is the most professional out of all of the child actors. Hey, even Fred and George are funny now, (though still not doing justice to the twins in the book). "
1113,10,I've seen it more than once - so should you! 10/10,"Hi there, sorry to throw a spanner in the reviews of the people that did like it, but I was thoroughly disappointed with it. The good things were the special effects, but even then, I was more impressed with the effects in ""The chamber of secrets"". I thought the movie was too grey/dark in it's setup, and it did not even scratch the surface of the book. Now I know this is normally the case, but I think the first 2 movies were a bit more following the lines of the books."
1114,5,Such a shame,"I have yet to read any of the Harry Potter books but I intend to eventually. My review is strictly based on the merits of the film, NOT the book."
1115,,"NOT ONLY THE BEST OF THE THREE, BUT A HUGE ARTISTIC LEAP","This was such a huge disappointment. I am stunned Rowling didn't complain about the movie when she saw it. The director spent a good deal of effort on the scenery and environment, although he changed the location of places within Hogwarts, but seemed not to care about the plot line. This movie makes no sense unless you have read the books and seen the previous movies and even then it is sad. Lines by Dumbledore are given to Sirius and Lupine, their relationship with James is barely explained. The director also altered much of the story in a way that makes no sense in furthering the plot. Saddest of all might be his sacrificing character development as the relationships in the movie frequently make no sense, why are Harry and Lupine hanging out with barely an introduction? why is Harry pouring out his heart to him? The lack of character development, continuity and plot are further diminished by his seeking the cheap laugh. Random jokes are put in which supplant humor which makes sense leaving the characters awkward and sometimes behaving in ways they wouldn't according to their personality. All in all this was a very sad disappointment"
1116,,a bad choice,I was amazed at this movie! I am so pleased about the latest movie installment in the Harry Potter Series! 
1117,10,Probably the best yet! (SPOILERS),"I mildly enjoyed it, but all this fuss about it being better than the first two is not true."
1118,7,Good but not great,"Even more so than the previous movies, tons of content from the book was completely ripped out for the movie. In addition, more content was added that was not in the book, which the other movies didn't even really do, and this movie had it in bucket loads. Some of the twists were interesting, but at the expense of some of the important scenes in the book, they were unjustified. Although, it may be possible there are many additional scenes on the DVD or something, many of my friends seem to think this was possibly the worst of their movies so far. Personally, I also felt the movie to be a bit shorter than it could have been (length wise) and due to the increasing age bracket they wish to target, I don't see any reason with making it a bit longer than it was."
1119,6,OK,"One thing I will say right off the bat is that Alfonso Cuaron was a terrible choice of directing. His infamous Yu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess hardly made the mark, but his adaption of HP missed it completely. J.K. Rowling said that she would make sure the movies followed the books, so I wonder why she wasn't paying attention. I love Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, and Emma Thompson, but they definitely could have been given better material than what they received. The kids show a mediocre talent which matches the movie to a T. HP and the POA is not a movie for Harry Potter fans, hands down. I'm sorry, but I did not like this adaption ***TWO THUMBS DOWN***"
1120,,Harry Potter and the Disappointment of Fans,"Chris Columbus set the bar for directing the HP movies, and Alfonso tries hard to live up to Columbus. Unfortunately, his best efforts fall a little short. While the acting is good, with film prodigies Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith to name a few. Unfortunately, they could have definitely been given better material. Cuaron, with other amazing pieces of work including Yu Mama Tambien and A Little Princess, got me looking forward to his newest ""masterpiece."" Unfortuately, it wasn't the masterpiece it could have been. The children, however, managed to follow through and act like naturals. I am very impressed with Emma Watson's portrayal as Hermione, almost reminding me of a young Keira Knightley. However, some cheesy one-liners and apparent CGI covers her smart performance. Being a fan of the other two movies, I walked out of the theater quite disappointed."
1121,,Disappointing,"(This review is for the cinema-goer who is only interested in if the film is worth spending money on to watch it, NOT for those who get excited about camera angles and editing!)"
1122,8,Some things missing but generally a good adaptation.,"Watching HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban is like having the suits in Hollywood tell you a bedtime story. --They always bring it back to the bottom line where THEY live happily ever after. It's not the story. It's not the art. It's certainly not the fans... It's just the money, the whole money and nothing but the money. Harry Potter is the biggest cash cow in the history of entertainment in any medium, and Warner Bros. has a good grip."
1123,8,Follow the Money with Warner Bros?,"The latest of Rowling's offerings to make the screen has all of the humor and interaction of the last two, but not as much of the magic (pardon the pun) of the previous editions. The new director, Alfonso Cuaron didn't pull off the same adolescent light-heartedness that Chris Columbus was able to portray in his two takes, adding a rather gloomy look to the film."
1124,8,"Maturing cast, new director.","The movie itself was great. It was really good for those who havn't read the book... but for those who have it may leave you wanting more. I would suggest waiting for the next move to see what happens. I have heard that they will be going into a little more detail then. The parts that were left out left out details that make for a better story, but the movie was still terrific visually and plot wise. More could have been done to give a bigger punch to the important sences. I only hope that there will be more in the next one. I have to say all the new aspects of the movie were better than what i had pictured them from the dementors to buckbeak. they were terrific. I can't wait to see the next one."
1125,,Good movie,"A much more mature movie compared to the other ones before it. This one lacks all the special effects of the two before it, however it was really good and I found that the lack 'whiz bang' effects were a welcome change. The storyline was much easier to follow because of it and the characters were more mature with just a hint of romance - and about time. A much more individual performance was given by each actor bringing each one into their own. Harry is finally more confident and his co-stars are less like groupies to him. Nice to see more than one character get the on screen attention. I love the twist of time storyline and the surprise about the prisoner. Who would have guessed! This movie is really worth seeing as the actors have really settled into the whole amazing life a Hogwarts giving them more time to personally find their own strengths. I can't wait to see the next one (but one year is too long) so I can again see the next development stage of these characters and their talent for tricks and mischief."
1126,6,movie,"I, personally, liked very much Harry Potter 3. It was such a amazing movie, and every time I see it I appreciate the actors' talents and do's... Ron Weasley become bigger and stronger than Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter's hair become more messed up and Hermione Granger's clothes changed well! That stayed good on a movie like this. The thing that me and many other watchers want to see is Ron and Hermione's love. In Goblet of Fire, that's explicit and obvious, when Ron becomes angry after Krum invites her to that dancing thing... well it's worth watching! 4 stars out of 5! P.S.: Why they never stop growing??? They're mutants? Harry Potter's not so BIG in 3rd book... well, thanks!"
1127,,It was good...,**Warning! Spoilers throughout**
1128,,"In Most Ways, this was a let-down. SPOILERS TO FOLLOW",harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is a excellent film although it doesn't all ways keep to the book. It also proves that girls can be just as good a boys when it comes to fighting. All members of the family will enjoy the third film of the collection.This is the best one of the harry potter films that have been released due to how the characters mature as the film does. And because more new characters have been brought into the new world of harry potter so over all i give this film 8 out of 10. i would recommend this film to anyone because it has been put together with such skill and perception that it is a masterpiece that every one should have the chance to see such a spectacular film and get pulled into the magical world of harry potter
1129,8,who will enjoy this film,"This without a doubt is the best movie yet. That is major because of the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, who really knows how to put magic into a movie. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved the first two movies, but something was missing and so was a flowing story. Cuaron improves on many things, from better sets too the movie rushing past you that you have to pay attention or you will get lost. While, he does all these good things, their are some things which hard-core fans of the books will dislike. Firstly, the movie isn't as faithful as the first two. While I think the first 2 were too faithful and they suffered because of it, many fans think a faithful movie is all that matters. Secondly, Cuaron has moved some things in the movie around to fit better with the story. This may bother some people who hate dis-continuity. Regardless of those things, Poa is a far better movie all-around, and I would love Cuaron to direct another hp movie."
1130,10,Definitely The best yet,"Critics of this film should just stop complaining and watch it for what it really is, a great, if very probably difficult adaptation to produce. The book I think most people will undoubtedly agree is one of the best in the series, containing all that is going to be hard isn't it. I agree that the changes that were made were unnecessary, moving Hagrid's hut and the whomping willow, but don't critics get it, the changes actually I think bring the film closer to the book than the first two. David Thewlis as Lupin just stole the film, he made it feel as if he was always on screen he had such presence. Gary Oldman was just great as Sirius Black, if only they had more screen time. Alfonso Cuaron, I just can't praise enough his influence on the film, it feels less like a bad children's film franchise now, and more like the magical world it was meant to be. Visually his influence is most notable, but I think the difference in all the actors shows as well. The harry potter world has grown up, just like it did in the book, and it got a lot better."
1131,9,Great adaptation belongs to Thewlis and Cuaron,I am sure that Harry Potter fans will turn out in true form to see this movie. The reputation of J.K. Rowling's story and Steve Kloves' (screen writer) adaptations of previous books have been exceptionally well done.
1132,6,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban/Falls Short,Alfonso Cuaron has made a common mistake among directors these days: just because a movie pretty doesn't mean it's good.
1133,6,"I paid to see a movie, not a piece of art!","and all-around excellent movie, but that guy playing dumbledore, just doesn't have the magic that Richard harrison had. The dude does NOT have the white beard, its a dirty beige, and when he talks, he sounds more old mannish and strict, rathere than eccentric, like Richard harrison did such a fantastic job playing. (may he rest in peace)i luv the flick, but i hate the guy who plays dumbledore. you could never replace Richard harrison. My fave part is buckbeak, the special effects in this movie are really cool. and harry is HOT. i like the girl who plays hermione. i think ron should seriously CUT HIS HAIr, he is really ugly. I especially liked this movie because, the timeturner was cooler because when they went back, it so happened that some of the things that happened in the original time, happened because they were there in past time, like the rock hitting harry in the head, and hermione threw it, but when they were traveling. That was complicated."
1134,9,"excellent, but that old man freaks me out",I like the character mr Black<br /><br />No doubt a true masterpiece it was.
1135,10,Masterpiece,**Spoilers ahead**
1136,9,"Hugely enjoyable, overall - some important flaws, alas.","I fell asleep, literally, several times - at a noon hour showing. Very little that kept me even mildly interested. This 3rd offering is by far and away the worst. It's no Shrek 2. There were few scenes at the School. And very limited use of the School's teachers. There were a few scary scenes, perhaps too horrific for the younger ones (under 6?). The cinematography was pretty good. Both my daughter and I found this film's storyline and plot confusing and non-sensical. Okay, the Special Effects were pretty good, but that does not make a movie great. And this film is a long, long way from great. Boring bigtime. Bring your jammies and be prepared to sleep. Yawn!!!"
1137,1,Boring waste of time and film stock,This movie was good. I loved the energy and the atmosphere that the new director brought to the franchise. Dan Radcliffe has really improved has an actor in this one - except for the crying scene that was quite ridiculous. Emma and Rupert are still delightful. 
1138,,Hermione is not superwoman and Ron is not a Coward,"The more I thought about it after seeing the movie the more it made me mad. It is different from the book in a few small ways that I don't mind and I am not going to get into how, except that having the firebolt in the movie as it was in the book could have been nice. "
1139,,Possible Spoiler Definite Rant,I am clearly addicted to Harry Potter stories.
1140,,the only reason I will see this again is because ...,"Cuaron's adaptation may stray from the source material far more than Chris Columbus' previous films did, but he's managed to capture the spirit of Rowling's world far more successfully. Several scenes in this film had more heart that the previous movies combined. A fantastic, warm, scary and pleasing fantasy. The kids shine as Harry, Ron and Hermione, while Gambon's Dumbledore has a liveliness befitting the character that was absent in the late Harris' portrayal. Gary Oldman is in the film for far too brief a time, but his presence looms large, and he's certainly arresting -- no pun intended -- when he is on screen. Buckbeak is a far more effective use of CGI than any of the previous creatures, as well. Is it wrong to want a hippogriff of your own?"
1141,9,This is the film the first two should have been,"Let's start at the beginning or the lack there of, as the film started some 45 minutes into the book missing out all the muggle news casts that Vernon rants about. OK we can forgive them for jumping in and starting filming there. But what happened to the rest of the book, Harry spends two weeks in diagon ally but its not in the film, Harry gets the firebult for Christmas in the film he gets it at the end. Hagrid's cabin has moved and so has the whole school. The quiddich match Harry uses the Protrinus charm on Drako not in the film. Drako Telling Snape that he saw Harry's head at the shack not in the film. The train ride back were Pigwidgen brings Harry his letter and were at the station Harry tells Vernon that Black is his godfather, not in the film, Blacks story of his escape not in the film. In the film Harry sees Worm tail  in the book its Loopin. The film Jumps around from chapter to chapter missing out vital parts that give us the insight into the life of Harry and his friends. Three books down and three books destroyed, the 3rd book was almost 12 hours long on audio cd the film was just over 2 hours. With the 4th film waiting in the wings and it being 20 hours long what savagery can we expect to bring this film in less than 3 hours? "
1142,,An Interpretation Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Very happy to see this film and eager to see it again, unlike the 2nd in the series!"
1143,9,Efficient screen adaptation---a change in director makes all the difference!,"What I've noticed is that every person who likes the movie always first says ""the special effects were great!"" When did special effects make a movie? "
1144,,Movies,"I was seriously excited for this movie and was really disappointed. I didn't mind the differences. I didn't care that the Firebolt was thrown out at the end, the dementors froze stuff and flew, the school looked different."
1145,,What happened to the story and characters?!,Believe me when I say that this is by far the best Potter film. Steve Kloves has out done himself on this one. He and Alfonso Cuaron are a perfect match for this one.
1146,10,This is the best of the Potter's!,"Before anybody reads this, I want you all to know that I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I am a fan of each and every one of them. Saying that, I'd like to express how much of a fan I am of this movie. I must confess that I was a little disappointed that the explanation of Harry's patronus and how it relates to the Marauder's Map was left out, but everything else about this movie made up for it. The music, special effects, acting, scenery, and surprisingly dark and stylish cinematography are all high points of this film. The book is something else, but this movie stands out on its own. I was so astonished and excited on how different this film was from the others, and I think that a change in director was very necessary, and it worked out fantastic. I am an avid fan of both books and movies and their adaptations, and I am able to view a film separate from it's book. This is a brilliant film and I still find it very enjoyable while being a fan of the book as well."
1147,10,Could I have asked for a better movie?,"Its amazing to see how all the the kids(teens) have grown since the first movie. Which Rupert, Daniel , and Tom look rather cute I must say. And to me I think Tom has grown the most out of them all. I can't wait to see how they all look by the end of the all the movies. And I can't wait till the final book. Its going to be amazing. And its sad that Richard Harris has died but they did get a good dumbldore. I'm truly looking forward to my Harry Potter Movie Marathon. Thats gonna be fun! What else could I say to use up the rest of lines so I can have this comment submitted. I'm not really doing much rite btw. And yeah so I HOPE everyone likes the movies!"
1148,10,Wow they have grown,"this movie really wasn't all that great nothing amazing. my main problem with this movie was the new director. he came in for the third movie and changed sooo many things. 1)the way the castle looks, he made that clock tower thing, which wasn't there in the first two. 2) in the first two the grounds were flat. the way to hagrids cabin was a grassy field. in this one is was rocky and tree covered with steps that lead down there (sure this was a better set up, but you can't change it so much in the middle of the series) thats just annoying. Crookshanks was supposed to be super fat!!!! i was looking forward to seeing a fat orange cat as sad as that sounds."
1149,5,ehhhh,Not bad as a movie. 
1150,,"bad bad bad, wait for the DVD !","I so wanted to love this movie! But it's not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Parts of the movie have improved over the other two films, but it also lost something they had. The acting was awesome--the kids have so much improved, and Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman were superb, as usual. And the visuals, the camera work, and the scenery were fantastic. But the film lacked a great story. There was so much left out of what happened in the book, and it went way too fast! I don't see how the longest book can turn into the shortest movie. I would have gladly sat through an extra half-hour to further develop the details of the story and characters. As I read in a magazine before I saw the film, Columbus is storyteller, and Cuaron is an artist. It's so true. Give me a great story any day!"
1151,6,"Great acting, lousy story","There isn't much else to say than that this movie was awesome. Cuaron's vision and dark tones was the perfect setting for what is the beginning of Harry's dark, downward spiral to the end of the series. I loved the 1st two movies that Chris Columbus directed because they set the scenario and established the characters for the viewers to understand and fall in love with. HPPoA is a dark book and therefore needed to be a dark movie. The actors have grown into their characters and all of the new characters had only nominal face time; with the exception of Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black . These two characters, Black especially become as important to the series as Harry, Hermione and Ron. I look forward to seeing the next installment,Goblet of Fire."
1152,10,The beginning of the end,"Can't you see how poorly the other actors, except for masters like Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman and Maggie Smith, are preparing for their roles in the film, which shows how much more we can lose when the books are translated into films? Let's get to my problems with the movie. If I cover it scene by scene, it will be very noticeable, so I've made a small list of the events that drive me crazy the most."
1153,1,Worst Book Translation,"The first two installments were so in-line with the book, but Azkaban left out so many critical and interesting points that the story suffers for it. This movies run time was too short and while the bird flying into the Whomping Willow was cute, there were too many redundant scenes and if these were cut, there would have been more time for the important dialogue in the Shreiking Shack. The school choir was another example of this, interesting, but not in the book. Also it was disappointing that this movie did not begin with Harry's birthday and end as the first two ended. But, the dementors were absolutely fantastic, as was the Maruaders map!! Stay until the end credits are over for a small bonus; besides that the Map is worth watching the complete credits."
1154,6,Much of story missing,"If you have not read the book you may not understand a couple of items, but you won't really notice them or think about them for long, if at all (ie. the stag, etc.). If you have read the books you must separate movie from book. Hey, I'm a Lord of the Rings fanatic and am completely able to LET GO of the many areas of lost content that leave most of the story unexplained and just ENJOY THE MOVIE. Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of the 4 - the first two were just too childish and sort of lame to enjoy if you are over 14, and the 4th was inexplicably odd - I have no idea why the characters whined so much and had inner fighting for no apparent reason and it was too dark and depressing, leaving nothing at the end to really care about - ie. why would i want to watch these characters again? Azkaban is a great time - much improved acting, great characters, engaging story - this is the HP that made me actually care about the characters, especially Harry, and the more I watch it the more moving and interesting it gets. Class act movie great for 10 - 99 year olds."
1155,8,I loved this movie - of the 4 this is the one i can put in and enjoy over and over.,"Having been deeply disappointed by the first 2 films, which missed the mark utterly despite the great cast and attention to small details, i went in to Azkaban thinking that it couldn't get much worse.. And i was right! "
1156,9,"Finally, a real film",I was totally dumbfounded when we walked out of this movie. All the buildup and hype for THIS? Incredible. :-(
1157,,Absolute crap.,"My daughter and I have been waiting with anticipation for the third of the harry potters to be released, but sadly were both extremely disappointed with the results. This third film should have been excellent as the book was the best of all 5. How can it have been made into an absolute mockery of the novel? My partner never reading the books, was left wondering what was happening and couldn't follow the plot fully without myself filling him in. I sincerely hope that the fact that there is yet another director working on the 4th film, will improve the viewing,plot and relation to the novel."
1158,1,A total disappointment,"After the colourful, warm and enchanting films that were ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""The Chamber of Secrets"", I had expected that ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- quite possibly the best of the Harry Potter books -- would be a quite splendid affair. Not so. Clearly, Alfonso Cuaran has failed. Dialouge is good, picture nice, but too little time is given to the brilliant actors, the movie is too short and rushed and does not live up to its potential. Very disappointing. I suggest you read the book instead. "
1159,3,A big disappointment!,"In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the movie takes on a less whimsical air than the previous two; while some of the same elements are present, Harry Potter's world is portrayed as more of a parallel yet normal reality for a young wizard. Things are also darker in the sense that, rather than being threatened by a three-headed dog or a deadly basilisk (which in their own rights are formidable), Harry Potter faces the potential danger of being a victim of less supernatural threats--murder and revenge."
1160,,Growing Up Harry,Spoilers Below (especially if you haven't read the books)
1161,10,"Amazing, trimmed a touch too much.","I loved the movie, but truth be told, I've read all the published books. I have no idea what I would think of the movies if I didn't love the books."
1162,10,"It's Just a Movie, People","It all sounded so promising... A darker film, no more Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron - a man whose films are stunningly beautiful, unfortunately Steve Kloves was still writing the script but hey we can't have everything can we..."
1163,5,What did they do to my film????,I was SO looking forward to the 3rd Harry Potter film. The story was a big step forward from the two previous books and they made some great additions to the cast. Unfortunately this film badly needed an extra 20-30 minutes to flesh out the story and add character depth. I feel they cut it down far too much and it has suffered as a result. Please let there be an extended version on DVD in the future.
1164,,A wasted opportunity with the best book so far,"I went along to this film expecting it to be pretty good. Not because I liked the other films because I only found them OK, nothing special, but because I heard good reviews, the trailers were impressive and because I wanted to see how the new director handled it."
1165,6,"Good, but not great","I saw this movie 1 and 1/3 times; the 1/3 stemming from the fact that the first time the sound broke down to unacceptable quality due to some unsolvable technical glitch. So a week later, I tried again, and got to enjoy the entire movie."
1166,,"From Hogwarts With Love, Some Of It Forgotten","As a Harry Potter Fans, this film can really satisfied me. It is full of excitement and fun. The acting of all actors, esp. Daniel and Gary Oldman is great. The story of the film is quite different from the book, but I think the changes are good. They suit the film. My favourite parts of the movie are the sense that Harry and Hermione go back into the past and the conversation between Sirius and Harry, very touching. The music by John Williams is excellent and I really hope that he can get an Oscar nomination. However, if the movie can explain more clearly about the relation between Lupin, Sirius and James,and why Harry's Patronum is Prongs, it will be better. This film is worth seeing!"
1167,10,Best of three!!!,"In my Harry potter and the prisoner of askaban, the best of the 3 potter movies is one the best movies of 2004. Its very good movie that tells ALMOST everything thats in the novel. This movie is good from start to finish and its a shame that shrek 2 has mad more money then askaban.The acting and visual effects are superb and like all a potter novels the story is first class. I really and truly hope that they will keep these actors it wouldn't feel the same if we replace these in which they have put a lot of effort to make the stories first class."
1168,10,The Magic still lives,"OK, here is my beef with this movie. For one There is way too much changed in the movie and taken out, and also way to much unnecessarily added. I don't know what the heck Quaron was thinking about with the addition of the rostafarion shrunken heads, but it was definitely not needed. the disappearance of goyle and the complete materialization of malfoys unknown friend was something that puzzled me. The recasting of tom at the leaky cauldron was downright annoying! I felt that his mere presence during the chat between the minister and harry took focus on what was really at stake, the matter of Harry's predicament with expulsion and possible arrest. No where in the book did it ever make tom out to be an annoying hunchback. Bad directorial intervention! Also, the absence of harry's visits down diagon alley make the whole firebolt thing at the end completely worthless. The audience has no concept whatsoever that this broom is among the greatest gifts Harry could receive, and the fact that once you see it, it looks like a piece of trash and not the state of the art masterpiece that it is supposed to be. They changed placement and look of the womping willow, which doesn't demonstrate ingenious directing style, but rather horrible sense of continuity. The dementors, looked good at first, but Quaron for some stupid reason left out the most terrifying thing about them. In Harry's conversations with Lupin, it is asked what is under the Dementor's hood, and it goes in about the dementors kiss. when reading the book, I found that finally seeing the gaping hole that is the dementors mouth and the eyeless face was the creepiest thing about them, and truly puts their horrific nature into scope, but of course it is left out. I have read many reviews discussing how the director's ""brisk feel"" he gives to the movie is refreshing and stylistic. What the Heck is that! The ""Brisk Feel"" is nothing more than trying to cram as much dialog into a short amount of time without emphasis on any of it, but merely saying it so that it could be said. For example...All of Proffessor Trelawny's scenes (Boy did they screw her up) They just let some things happen without explanation or anything. They go through all the trouble of shooting the scene where the kids are eating the jinxed candy to sound like animals, but don't even spend a sentence informing that ""Fred and George made them"". There, 5 words, 2 seconds, and you would have at least made some half hearted attempt to indicate how much of jokers fred and george really are (which regretfully has been neglected through all the movies). They say the map is the secret of their success...WHAT SUCCESS?!?! And as good of personalities as they are, they should get touched upon more often. Now lets focus on lupin. His illness is only lightly touched upon,his office was completely devoid of the specimans that made it so interesting, it looked more like a dark wizards den. The connection between him and the map is totally forgotten about, as are his and his friends' nicknames. And am i the only one that thinks that the scene on the bridge where he and harry are talking it is implied that he had feelings for Lily...Where the heck was that in the book. And now casting. I'm Sorry Michael Gamdon, but you not Richard Harris, and it is a tragedy that he is lost forever, for was truly dumbledore. But i thought he could have at least put forth a little more effort to match his characters personality. when reading the book, i couldn't help but imagine a disheveled Kevin Kline as Lupin, not saying the other guy did a bad job, far from it. But appearance wise I thought the got it wrong. Tom the inkeeper I have already touched upon, Trelawny's character could have been better if they would have just slowed the scene down a bit, give the poor woman time to breath. and Macnair the executioner looked like a goblin from lord of the rings. And now the Thing that bugs me most about the film, the proof that the director didn't even read the thing. The emphasis on the book is on friendship. true connection between people that is strong enough to sacrifice oneself for. The connection between Lupin, Sirius, James, and Peter (whose history should have at least been tried to explain) is what truly makes the betrayal so painful. The bonding between Hagrid and the kids to Buckbeak was the only thing that barely came acrossed as strong. When peter is reveled, the whole lecture about self-sacrifice for ones friends is rushed through and completely not felt. The only thing that i felt was good about this movie was the performances by the three main kids. Other than that, this movie was a horrible disappointment. I'll have more to complain about if i see this movie again."
1169,,horrible disappointment(spoilers),"I really enjoyed the feel of this movie. It does deviate from the books in many ways, but I felt the director captured that feeling you get when reading the book."
1170,10,Movie does book artisic justice,HP& THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is the best movie of the series so far. I did not like the book that much but i loved the film. The story was good. The stayed true the story and added some great improvements. The acting was superior. The special effects were awesome. Great job Alfonso! Wish you were on to direct the 4th installment. Well done! It was scary and funny! The script was beautifully written. The Dementors were awesome! The Hippogrith was a beautiful creature. Hermione rocks. Ron and Harry are so cute. I liked Draco's new sense of fear was so cool. I like him in that role. I cant wait for Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire. I now have to go and dust of the book and read it before the movie comes out.
1171,10,the best movie so far of the three!!!!!!!!!!!!,"No, I haven't read the books; I am more of a Thomas Pynchon reader, but I actually adore these films while I detest mainstream cinema. The direction in this film is much more thoughtful than the previous two. The camera angles are highly effective at setting the mood and intensity of the scenes, and the cinematography is more organic creating a ambient magical realism. The acting is brilliant, to state the obvious and expected, and there is a bit more humor and emotion in this version."
1172,9,"Dark, and Bloody Brilliant!",They are very different when you compare the first two movies and this third one. I just saw it and must say that I will have to see it at least once more to appreciate it fully. But non the less it is a good movie with a very different scenery this time. 
1173,8,very different,"The third book, to any of you who have actually read the series, will know that the books are a million times better than the films and J.K. Rowling although trying her best is not delivering films to the standards of her books. I do believe it is the best film so far but doesn't do the book a huge amount of justice. For those who liked the film i suggest reading the book it is after all so much better! The first couple of books cannot compete with the third which i believe to be the best out of all five. It is very disappointing to such a harry potter fan as me to see the books be destroyed by these films! I do believe that the film is recommendable but reading the books is far more enjoyable!"
1174,,Will never be as good,There may be spoilers below but nothing that HP fans wouldn't already know.
1175,,Fantastic!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the greatest film in the Harry Potter franchise.Spooky and Mysterious, a lot darker than the two previous attempts. However brilliant acting from Dan Radcliff and Emma Watson. Note about Rupert Grint: He definitely has a talent for comedy. Brill acting from Dame Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman. Also new cast members were brilliant, notably Emma Thompson as spooky Professor Trelawny and David Thewlis as Professor Lupin. However the Dursleys part was underrated. Richard Grifitths and Fiona Shaw should have had more screen time. In all a brill movie.Best book and best movie matched together. A treat for all true Potter fans!!!"
1176,,Mysterious and Spooky,"I'm not sure what movie others were viewing but the Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban I saw was a badly disjointed cinematic effort which left my date totally confused. Those who have not read the books or at least seen the previous two movies had no chance to follow the storyline, if indeed there was a storyline. The seemingly endless movie was more of a series of out-of-context skits strung together for over two hours. The misery ended for me and I sincerely hope other Harry Potter fans avoid this one as a true stinker. "
1177,6,This was NOT an enjoyable movie.,"I've only read the book twice and it was quite a while ago, so many of the little details that they left out that so upset everyone else, I didn't even remember anyway. Fans had better get used to this - how else are they going to squash the 4 inch thick unedited tome of book 5 into less than 8 hours?"
1178,,A vast improvement on its predecessors,"I like Harry potter series VERY VERY much, but the same thing is repeated in every movie, that many many things are not included in the movie which are there in story which makes it not very likable for my those friends who has not read the story. Otherwise each and very detail present in the movie is EXCELLENT. I like Harry potter series VERY VERY much, but the same thing is repeated in every movie, that many many things are not included in the movie which are there in story which makes it not very likable for my those friends who hasn't read the story. Otherwise each and very detail present in the movie is EXCELLENT."
1179,9,Ultra Fast Paced movie,"I saw the movie yesterday and I loved it! The camera work was amazing using extreme angles, and shots which last up to a minute. The 'moving' camera really did create a great effect. The acting is so much better this film too. A lot of people have felt that the darker feel has meant that the film doesn't seem as magical now but I disagree, its such an improvement from films 1 and 2. They were OK films and people loved them because it was harry potter but PoA is in a different league. "
1180,9,The best harry potter film yet...by far,"It's always tough watching a film when you've read the book, but this entry in the Potter series is by far the best so far. Perhaps it was the fact that the books themselves have improved with each new offering. In any case, the visuals, pacing and story are all tighter and focused than previous films."
1181,9,Best of the Series So Far,"I preface my comments by stating that I had exceedingly high expectations for this film. Harry Potter is one of my many obsessions, and after watching the trailer, I was sure that this film would be by far the best of the three. I was, however, disappointed. The cinematography was beautiful, and most of the acting was much improved (aside from Radcliffe's pitiful crying scene and Hermione's pathetic dependency acts), but the movie was so poorly thrown together. The first twenty minutes were hilarious. I was rolling in my seat laughing as Aunt Marge blew up, busting buttons (which consequently hit Dudley in the face), and the Knight Bus was equally amusing. Sadly, however, once you get any farther, disappointments ensue. The set is entirely different. This isn't necessarily always a bad thing. The set was much extended, but certain aspects of the it were noticeably different. The whomping willow decreased to about half of its size and also changed locations."
1182,10,"A Good Movie, but not True to Harry Potter",Put it this way....
1183,9,Even people who thought they hated Harry Potter will love it!,"One thing that goes without saying, this was much better than the first two. The adaptation from the book to the movie was done very well, and the three main actors (especially Daniel Radcliffe) did much better. Some other great movies I've seen this year are ""Passion of the Christ"", ""Troy"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Super Size Me"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""Kill Bill 2"", ""Shrek 2"", but this movie beats all of them, this is the best movie of the year by far! I thought everything about this movie was excellent, and the part that I enjoyed most was that when Hermione didn't have class, she'd be walkin' around with the coolest clothes ever, like light jeans with a belt, and a pink buttoned downed shirt with a cool pattern on it, not to mention her hair looked pretty good. Also an excellent popcorn movie. And take my advice, don't see ""Shrek 2"", see ""Harry Potter 3."" It will be more appropriate for your kids, and much, much better too."
1184,10,THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR BY FAR!!!!!!!,"A guy walked straight up to me at the end of the movie and asked what I thought, and I answered right away that it had the exact 'feeling' of the book. It totally felt like 'Prisoner of Azkaban'! Yes, loads (lol) were missing, but I felt none of it during the film... unlike the jarring missing parts of 'Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone', which I still adore none-the-less. "
1185,10,It FEELS like the book,So was the latest Harry Potter Installment worth the wait?
1186,8,My own review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"My best friend got me started on the Harry Potter books, and I've read every one. The first two movies seemed pretty true to the book, but I felt this one left out some pretty important things. I understand that for a book as long as this they have to slim things down a bit to put it on film, I felt they slimed down too much. In the book you really felt the closeness Harry felt toward Sirrus, and the relationship that Sirrus, Lupin & Peter had with his father, James. I didn't really feel a sense of either in the movie. As a matter of fact, all that was said in the movie was that they were friends of his parents. This book gave the reader an idea of how much Harry is like his father, the movie never does. My biggest pet peeve about this film though, is that at the end, when Harry does the spell to hold back the Dementors, they show the white stag, but never mention it. If the person watching didn't read the book they'll have no idea what that was or why it appeared. It was also never told why Sirrus, Peter, and James turned into animal forms or that James form was a white stag. Which is why Harry sees the stag during the spell. Over all, the movie was wonderful visually, but I was very disappointed in the story. I'm not too sure I'll go to see the next movie."
1187,5,"Good, but missing important points(POSSIBLE SPOILERS).","Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch."
1188,10,Absolutely Brilliant!!!!,"Using our previous knowledge of the Harry Potter universe to his advantage, Alfonso Cuaron has created the first sophisticated film foray into the world of wizards, witches, werewolves and hippogriffs. Cuaron benefits from the experience his lead actors have in performing these roles in two prior films. Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron have all become these characters before our eyes, and it is wonderful to watch."
1189,10,Cuaron creates masterpiece,"I went to see this in Imax which made it a lot more fun! It was the opening day and I was sooooo excited, Not only do I get to see the now mature and hot Emma Watson again on film, I get to see one of the 5 books that made me read and get some knowledge into my brain put on the screen. I had trouble thinking that the director of a raunchy sex film would make a good adaptation of Mrs.Rowling's perfect story. he turned out to be a great choice! the movie is superb in every way. The only put down for me was that Harry got his Firebolt at the end. The werewolf was cool, too! Dementors are actually scary, and the monster book of monsters was kind of freaky! I give this film a perfect 100%"
1190,10,Beautiful and delightful are the 2 words that sum this film up,"This movie was most clearly better adapted from the previous Harry Potter films not because of being true to the book, but the spirit. What struck me the most of what was wrong with the first two were that they were *too* close on following JK Rowling's Harry Potter, and left the wow factor at that, save for the pause-to-awe of the awesome magic that really made the films too childish and stupifying. This film weaves the magic throughout the experience and causing wizardry to be more normal and casual, helping to add to the darker, more adult act. I was especially pleased by Gary Oldman's Sirius Black, in fact most out of the new characters added to Harry Potter. The actors for Peter Pettigrew and Prof. Trelawney was passable, and the acting for Prof. Lupin was a good choice. This was definitely the best of the three so far, but unfortunately I will be happy to see the director skip HP 4, because of this history that he would go over many of the very significant plots of the book."
1191,9,Best adaptation of the spirit of Harry Potter,"As Harry and Hermione crouch near the pumpkin patch, she in her light pink hoodie and he in his blue jacket, their microphone packs/ battery packs/ whatever they are can be seen on their backs. Watch carefully... it's in quite a few scenes, but not in all. I do wonder why they would have these packs on their backs, with ADR and boom operators, I didn't know they used packs like these. It upsets me that I noticed the packs, I was impressed with the film up to that point, but then I was taken out of the fantasy world right-quick and it had a negative affect on my viewing experience... although I was able to put it out of my mind for the duration of the film. It denotes a sloppiness that makes the movie less impressive."
1192,,Technical Mistake!!!,"Saw harry potter 3 today, it didn't exceed my expectations cause everyone was hyping it up saying it was amazing and scary and all, i thought that it wasn't scary, definitely for children maybe, but i didn't get creeped out at all. The direction is much better and improved, i'm glad to see this guy was chosen cause i think the film is better with a darker tone. Harry potter still is a not the greatest actor if u ask me, i didn't like him that much, never have. Hermoine did better, and Ron is just as good as he has been. I thought the special effects were really good, the dementors were crazy, that was cool. (SPOILERS) Gary Oldman i guess did o.k. cause he was only in the movie for like literally 10-15mins, and it goes by fast making it seem like 5mins. I definitely enjoyed this movie, but it could have been better in ways, like the very last shot of the film wasn't very good it hough, and the ending was kinda rushed. Besides that, lupin was great, and the movie goes by really fast, enjoy it."
1193,8,Big Imporvement,"Having been unable to see or rent this DVD since its release, I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy for the first time last night. Wow! I've never read the books and now feel I never need to after watching the third and most challenging of the three films (I'd seen the other two and was so bowled over by the plots, CGI and acting of the hundred or more central characters that I didn't feel I was worthy enough of being able to endure a third, classic, masterpiece)."
1194,1,Who needs to read the books now?,"Harry Potter is one of those phenomenons that you either get or you don't. Having a little sister who has read all of the books and is properly immersed in Potter-lore I can understand to a certain extent why kids are so enamoured by the boy wizard. I myself have read all the books over the last few years, which I enjoyed even if they were relatively unremarkable."
1195,7,Harry Potter and the New Lease of Life,"I have been reading some of the comments and reviews for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and most of what I have read have been comments on how disappointing the overall movie itself was. Especially to the people who have read all of the books and who are adamant on staying faithful to the books and having the whole story involved in the film. Some of the comments I agree with. Like for instance, the movie was a little bit choppy, certain scenes in the movie were not explained in full detail, and at times the scenery and props like the Whomping Willow , Hagrid's House, and Hogwarts itself was completely invisioned in a different way than what we were use to in Chris Columbus'first two versions and that can be a shock and in a way weird to us fans but Columbus and Cuaron' are two totally different directors and they each had an interpretation and vision of what Harry's world would look like. To me, Cuaron' captured a more realistic approach to the film and he allowed a more dark, organic, and even daring feel to POA. I think he did a great job of combining more natural elements with the world of magic. There is nothing wrong with change if you have an open enough mind to except it. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are growing into young adults with adult problems and adult situations and the overall tone of the film coincides with that growth. I give the man much respect and props for being so bold as to completely unveil his version of POA without the sugarcoating and child like qualities that the first two movies had. Harry Potter is geared towards children but all children grow up. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, like I said before in my first review, has it's minor filming flaws but was fantastic in my eyes and I can't wait for all of the other films. I will be very interested in how Mike Newell will interpret Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."
1196,10,"Sometimes, Change is Good","I recently saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I thought it was fantastic. I am a 30 year old, African American woman from New Jersey and I love the Harry Potter series. I know that the series is geared towards children but I just love the series so very much. I have yet to read any of the books but I have seen all of the movies and so far this one is my absolute favorite. This movie is so terrific and so different than the other two films. I love that the film was geared towards more darker, scarier and adult themes. I also loved the fact that Harry Potter is growing up and he is showing a more emotional side to himself. I am glad that we get to see his anger, his sadness, and his strength. I like the way he stood up against the Dursleys, I loved how the students were relaxed and wearing street clothes, I liked the guys hanging out just acting like teenage guys. The special effects were amazing, I loved the blossoming romance between Hermoine and Ron even though they pretend to hate each other. Daniel Radcliffe is turning into a seasoned actor, Emma Watson has grown into a beautiful, strong, and smart character in the film, and Rupert Grint is just a red haired cutie pie with great acting and comedy timing. All in all I thought the movie was great. I love all of the changes and all of the characters and if this is the growth of Harry Potter then they are definitely going in the right direction. This is the best film so far and I predict that its just going to get better and better."
1197,10,THE MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC,"for me , the film concentrated on being scary ... it was over all a waste of money for everyone who worked on this film... to think the director / script writer didn't go in depth with the characters enough was just plain stupid... it had the potential to be a great film , after all it was my favorite book... it was also way to short ... and very very choppy... i did like the depiction of the dementors and i do like how the character of Sirius and Remus came out ... just next movie i hope they try to be more about the feelings of the book , than trying to scare people... i did enjoy seeing Harry's aunt blow up...and the fact that all the characters have slightly evolved... well thats all i guess , i would have liked it a lot more if it were in depth just even a bit."
1198,8,Not the greatest,"Thanke ye godds for Alfonso Cuaron! This film is far, far better than the first two. The young actors have learned how to act, the set is absolutely bootyful, the costumes are modern(hallelujah! they really add 2 it), and, to top it all, the younger actors are really growing up to look a lot more like the characters as i saw them in my head (yes, people live in my head. if you have a problem with it, speak 2 my psychiatrist :]). Daniel Radcliffe (harry)... wahey! He's beginning 2 be really good looking! As is Tom Felton(malfoy), who, incidentally, looks so much better with floppy hair... what was with the gelled back crash helmet from the last two films? Richard Harris is greatly missed, not only in himself, but as dumbledore, however, Michael Gambon steps in brilliantly, and does a lovely job, all the same (albeit without the marvellous twinkle of the eye that Harris so marvelously possessed)"
1199,,"to quote Ron ""Bloody hell! that was brilliant!""","The latest installment in the Harry Potter septology has swerved away from the lighter, childish approach of the first two movies, which I believe is for the best, adopting a darker tone."
1200,,"By the Pricking of My Thumbs, Something Darker This Way Comes",(Spoilers)
1201,10,The magic Within!,"The film was absolutely amazing. Alfonso has worked his own magic to truly bring Harry Potter to life. The direction and cinematography were not at all hindered by Hollywood pressure, and this is by far one of the best major studio films I've seen. It is truly a brilliant piece of art."
1202,10,Amazing piece of art,"Alright, I'll admit it, when I first heard of the Potter books I thought ""another pre-teen fad"". But then I read them and I couldn't put them down. Ms. Rowling is a very good story teller who really knows how to throw in twists. This is one reason why the movie version of The Prisoner of Azkaban is so disappointing."
1203,,Could have used another twist of the Time-Turner,"Rule1 : If the film (or theatre play) comes first the book will in fact be awful. Rule2: If the book comes first the film will only be good if the book was already awful (cf starship troopers). As a result filmmakers have a hard time to meet expectations when the books are superb. The films can only be ""not as bad as expected"". They will only be good if the film makers are bold enough to simply scrap parts of the book and/or introduce something new. So where are we now with the Harry Potter films? HP I: not as bad as expected. Indeed, people who don't know the book are rightfully impressed. HP II: Outrageous because the house elf Dobby(in the way he is portrayed) is something new. The film is not a film for children any more but more in the Gothic genre. This makes the film outrageous, but very good indeed. HP III: Good cutting down to the essential plot. This makes it giving a somewhat breath-taking rushing impression while it leaves facts and scenes which are very impressing in the book look somewhat flat. People who don't know the book find this a very speedy movie. My rating: better than expected indeed. The only true disappointment is the prophecy teacher, she is not just very different from the book but outright ridiculous."
1204,,"Comparing them all, mixed feelings.",Now how does the time travel in this film work?!!!! It doesn't make sense what so ever when the time travel is introduced and even before it is. when harry is in Hagrids hut before Buckbeak is executed he clearly gets hit on the head with a pumpkin stone and another stone smashes a jar in the hut and when harry turns around no-body is there. But when Harry and Hermione go back into the past it is Hermione that throws the stone at harry to warn him the executioner is coming this leads to a very confusing story line of how originally hit harry with the stone because this would mean they had already went back in the past which would have meant again they had went back in the past before that and also when Ron is in the hospital wing and harry and Hermione come back after saving Serius black and Buckbeak we see an other Hermione and harry leaving to go back in time which would mean it would happen all over again which is very confusing.
1205,10,Confusing.,"hello first off i want anyone reading this to understand that i have read the books all the way. OK, i found this movie to be more or a disappointment than some people say it was. but i would recommend this movie to any one who doesn't mind violence. or action. seeing how there is a good bit or that in the movie. if your looking for a movie you can see time after time, this is not the movie for you. a person could most likely see this movie about two (2) times before it lost all or most of the fun, surprise, and everything else. i recommend you to read the book before or after the movie. and i m sorry about any spelling mistakes"
1206,6,worth the 8 bucks but not really,"As good as the first 2 Harry Potter films were, there was always something missing for me. It's hard to know what exactly, but the first two films felt a little like 'Famous 5' even if there were 3 main characters. Too much unlikely dialogue."
1207,,At Last - A film to do the book justice,"I went to see HP for the second time last night and I have to admit it grows on you. I think it could be because your expectations are more realistic second time round and so appreciate what is there rather than notice what is not. The kids aren't too bad. There are some dodgy moments, especially Harry's upset/angry scene (""He killed my parents!"") which was appalling, but overall he has improved no end and is finally becoming the Harry that the books portray. Hermione ha also improved and there were moments when I really thought that she WAS Hermione, but there were still the odd wooden line or things that just didn't hold true for the character. Ron was excellent and definitely Ron for me, though I think it's a shame that his part was so limited. The Hermione/Ron love thing was developed well and the chemistry was excellent, but i still don't like it cus it's too obvious too soon (in the series). The setting was magical and magnificent and the effects were perfect. I loved the humour of the script, but hated the feeling that everything was being rushed for the purpose of time. I want to relax when i watch a film! The adults were superb, especially Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson, and Michael gambon was a better Dumbledore for me (no dis-respect to Harris). An all round huge improvement in the series, if only the first two had been that good. Getting better as an adaption but will never satisfy the hard-core book fans. Its on the right track, but I still feel that if I didn't love the books then the movies would be nothing. Its a good film of a truly fantastic book, so although the film is good, still doesn't do an amazing book 100% justice. Aside from that, a very good film, i would like to see it again."
1208,,Better 2nd time round,In the scene after Prof Lupin demonstrates the way to get over the worst fears - i noticed harry's scar was on his left temple...did I make a mistake or was it wrong..did anyone else notice?
1209,6,the scar - right or left temple,"well well well - what can i say - it is a great movie - well done - visually it is a treat. it starts with the usual drama of how harry is being treated badly and his dose of sweet revenge - perhaps a bit overdone and it is beginning to look dated. the bus to the leaky cauldron is terrific. superb editing and a nice tension mixed with some comic elements - not kiddish at all. the main reason this movie falls below the second one is because the plot is not well developed by the director. i don't feel the angst for the escaped prisoner and i keep asking myself what has he done - of course, of course, he has been involved in the murder of his parents you dumbo - that qualifies for him to be hated so much, to be imprisoned for 12 years......wish the director had some visualisation of the murder of Harry's parents or about Azkaban and its horrific nature etc. or simply about Siruis himself...the movie almost starts with the character in it and goes no further to create that tension to dislike him....i did'nt develop strong feelings for Sirius black and there the plot feel a few notches compared to the previous movie the chamber of secrets i felt here the story line is a bit weak. the chamber of secrets had a great ending with the fight sequence with voldermot et al. the ending here - the tim e travel etc is lever but not so engaging and feels a bit affected...the dementors have been conceived very well...the cold, dark, menace they are comes across superbly. hermione's character is well developed while Rons's roles is too shallow. Harry of course is the hero and has done a great job. some predictable elements like poor malfoy getting bashed up etc...and i wonder whether it was at all necessary to have the divination teacher ( emma thompson)...felt very flaky and purposeless."
1210,6,liked chamber of secrets better,---SPOILERS---
1211,,Mixed Opinions,"Us at the Odeon all saw the run-through of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban this morning- and boy does it rock. I mean, the acting is still a little dodgy and the new Dumbledore is a little sketchy but maaaaannnnnn...."
1212,8,Fan-bloody-tastic,"I am going to start by saying how much I have loved the Harry Potter books; their growing complexity and J.K. Rowling's ability to have the characters mature is amazing. Unfortunately, the movie adaptations are falling away from quality of the original written work. The Prisoner of Azkaban is visually stunning and the casting is superb, but the filmmaker is assuming that the audience will have read the books before having seen the movie. This is probably a fair assumption, but it was in the omission of minor details that bothered me the most about this film. A few extra lines of exposition would have made all the difference in the world to the quality of the film and its continuity. "
1213,6,Not quite all there,I really liked this film.
1214,9,Very good.,"Maybe I am just a Potter purist, but part of me thinks the movie could have been a little better. Granted, it stuck to the main points of the book, but it moved a little fast for my taste and I was sad to see that they did not show the quidditch house cup scene. There were a few times where the movie strayed from the book, like the whole scene with Harry looking for Pettigrew in the corridor, but nothing really too major. I did enjoy the new music and look that this new director added to the films, and i thought that the acting was much better. I was also pleased with Thewlis' Portrayal of Lupin and Oldmans portrayal of Sirius. But I just think they took too much out. Granted the movie was already 2 1/2 hours long and they stuck to the main points, but there were some parts that I was looking forward to seeing and didn't. But, then again, I am a Potter purist. I give it a 9 out of 10."
1215,10,Not too bad,"First Batman, then The Matrix, and now Harry Potter! Why does Warner Bros. have to ruin every series of movies they turn out?"
1216,1,Warner Bros. Does It Again,"Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, there were some cool scenes, but the director altered it SO MUCH, not only from the book, but from the other freaking films. I mean, the landscape of Hogwarts looks like the result of a devastating mudslide based on how much it has changed. It really is noticeable. There are also so many minor alterations from the book that seemed out of place. For example, what the heck was with the talking head on the Knight Bus? That was just dumb. Also, the pace of the entire time they were at school seemed like it went all too quickly and it was rushed. The pace was really off and they never really had an ending to the SCHOOL, just an ending of Harry's adventure/quest. "
1217,6,"I have to admit, as an AVID READER, this movie was not that great...","I honestly thought that this was the most brilliant of the three movies. All three of the kids have grown so much as young actors and actresses. The performance given by Gary Oldman (Sirius Black), and the chemistry between him and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) were completely brilliant. The only lacking part of this movie was the quidditch scene. Brilliant and beautiful as it was, it was cut way too short (around five minutes, mostly of Harry dodging dementors), and this is a problem as this is many young children's favourite part of the Harry Potter movies. Both Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger)have transitioned gracefully into teenagers, both very good looking, while Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley)has kept with his character's lanky, less smooth looks. Congratulations, Alfonso Cuaron, 10 out of 10."
1218,10,What I Thought,"This has got to be the best Harry Potter movie yet, it is way better than the first two. I love it sooo much that I am going to see it again for my friends birthday! I saw it 9:45 31st May 2004, I was one of the first people in Wales to see it, or so I have been told! It is very funny in various parts of the movie (nearly all of those funny moments were provided by Rupert Grint-Ron Weasley!) The animals in the movie are soooooo cute (even Crookshanks)! Aunt Marge being blown up was one of the highlights of the movie! My personal favourite part of the movie was the boggart scenes, snape in a dress = HILARIOUS! Honestly I think Rupert Grint was the best in that movie and overall although the position of Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow was changed from the first two movies it was an excellent movie!!!"
1219,10,"WOW! I think it contains SPOILERS, not sure though!",how disappointing! i expected so much from this film... i guess columbus was better as a director... it felt bad to see how the harry potter series was ruined. the first two are definitely great but this one lacked story and it's just plain boring! it runs for over 2 hours but there were so many dull moments unlike the first two harry potter films which were flooded with lots of fun and surprises... i hope (no offense to cuaron) that the director will be changed on the next hp film. 
1220,,disappointing... i expected so much..,"I was thoroughly disappointed with Harry Potter 3. They didn't stick to the book at all! This movie missed so many important details and explanations of why things were the way they were. My dad, who has never read the books, said it went straight to the point, but he didn't understand why some things happened. I think one of the things he had trouble with was the time turner. It's hardly played up in the movie and it is one of the most important things because that's what saves the day. "
1221,,what's up with this?,"It was the greatest film ever! It's exciting and a bit scary... The pace is great, you fly through the story, so there is enough time to show the important bits. There are many things directly taken from the book, and if you are a huge fan like me that's nice. And Sirius Black, I think they couldn't have casted a more brilliant man than Oldman. He's wonderfully crazy and weird. Not so great is that when you haven't read the books you'd probably not understand everything. There's no explanation of Potter, Black and Pettigrew becoming Animangi for Lupin....And you wouldn't recognize james potter....but ahh what the hell, It's an amazing movie....you should all go see it!!"
1222,10,Brilliant,"Its Harrys 3rd year in Hogwarts and yes the trio are still getting themselves into trouble at any chance. This is one of the plus points of the film, which in my opinion is some way off the other 2. As a huge fan of the ""Harry Potter"" series and having read all the books i feel this film left out a bit to much of the fun material associated with Harry Potter. Instead the film had a very rigid storyline and without the fun most of us love in these films lost my attention very soon. Of course this opinion is as a HP lover and is compared to the other 2 films. In all it is a Very very good film but not one that reminds me very much of the Harry Potter saga."
1223,6,"A good film,but some way off the others.",Straight off I think the film was visually stunning and the effects are great. The dementors turned up and i was impressed they sent a chill down my spine almost as effectively as when i first read about them.
1224,,Mixed feelings,"The third book was definitely more exciting than the first two. However the movie did not do it justice. The actors did a superb job with their characters and the movie was well made, but important and exciting parts of the book were left out. Here's the spoiler: Harry never got presents from his friends, there was no visit for Harry to Diagon Alley, no second Quidditch game for the Cup, the chapter on the Firebolt was left out only to be thrown in at the very end, the movie didn't explain why Lupin and Black were Animagus, they also left out the part where Black tries to attack Ron in the Gryffindor tower, Ron doesn't get his new owl nor does Harry get permission to visit Hogsmeade, and Crookshanks was hardly included and you kind of needed him to be. Hopefully they will and try and include that in the beginning of the next movie And there are more. I understand that the book was long and they couldn't include it all but I think fans of the book will be disappointed. Another thing that has me worried is that if they cut out all of that from this book cause it was so long, what will the leave out of the next two which are longer than this one, especially The Order of the Phoenix? I'm sure there's more they left out that I forgot. Like I said, the movie was made well and the actors did a great job, but I just felt a little cheated. Glad as I was to see it, I think I prefer the book more. So that's my thinking on the movie. I understand that nothing can be perfect but some things just shouldn't be messed with."
1225,6,Book is better...Spoiler...,"Sorry for my poor English, I will be trying to do my best to be as clear and understandable as possible..."
1226,,"Good Visuals, Spirit Missing","Sorry for my poor English, I will be trying to do my best to be as clear and understandable as possible..."
1227,,"Good Visuals, Spirit Missing, -SPOILER warning-","It is very obvious that alfonso cuaron never read the series of books, if he did he would have never turned it into the rubbish that it is. Thanks a lot alfonso for ruining my favorite book with the dribble that you directed.I was waiting in anticipation for Azkaban to come out. When it did I have never been so disappointed in my life with a movie. The utter lack of very important storyline, like why was Harry's patrouns a stag, was left out of the movie. As a matter of fact the only people I have found who enjoyed the movie was people who didn't read the books. Plus the new Dumbledore was horrible. Dumbledore is supposed to be wise and grandfatherly, the new player was not convincing as either."
1228,,Very upset Harry fan.,There are as many great things about this movie as there are sad disappointments.
1229,6,win lose situation,"Last night I had the distinct pleasure of going to see the third installment of the Harry Potter films. I, like so many others of you out there, have read every book and am anxiously awaiting the sixth book's arrival. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was my favorite book of the five that are out so far. I cannot say, however, that the movie was my favorite. So many things were contradictory in the third as compared to the first and second. For example, weren't Hagrid's hut and the Weeping Willow quite close to the castle in the first and second movies? In the third they are a tremendous distance away. Also, I haven't gone back to check, but I'm pretty sure Professor Flitwick (or who I thought was playing Professor Flitwick) was a completely different actor that looked nothing like the original. Those are just some differences and contradictions from the three movies. That says nothing of all the things they left out from the amazing book. What happened to two of the three Quidditch games? Didn't Gryffindor win the Quidditch and House Cups? I thought it was very important for Harry to meet Cho Chang in the third book considering they somewhat get together in the fourth, but she was nowhere to be seen. One of the biggest reasons I was looking forward to the third movie was Hogsmeade. I couldn't wait to see Zonko's Joke Shop, Honeydukes, and the Three Broomsticks. Not there. Didn't see a bit of it. No Butterbear, no Chocolate frogs. Nothing. I'm disappointed in the movie, but don't get me wrong; it was an excellent movie and I understand that they could not get everything in there. I just think they left out some key elements. "
1230,,Disappointment,"Please, people, remember that books can not be translated to screen without some changes. I thought personally that there were things that should have been different (Some of Dumbledore's actions) However, The makers of this film didn't ask me. To be honest, they only wanted to make a good movie, not be slammed for doing the best that they could. The acting was very good, and it was good to see David Thewis in a role that was not a villain (i.e. Cyrus Crabb)I was very pleased with the movie over all. STOP COMPARING THE BOOK TO THE MOVIE. JK Rowling said on her own website that she was pleased with the movie. To the Cast and Crew, Well Done. Only one thing, please don't make 4 only in one movie, that would cut out way too much. Good Luck in your futures."
1231,,Oh For Crying Out Loud,I liked the film and i thought it was funny...but it was far from true to the book and i wish they could have tried a little harder to stay true to the book. Maybe a least put the scenes in the right order. The film seemed a bit quick to me almost choppy. I loved the funny lines that really didn't come to play in the first to movies.
1232,,Positive yet Negative yet not really at all,"I've heard both sides. The Harry Potter movies are brilliant!...and the Harry Potter movies aren't all that fantastic. I've heard the same about the books. What I remembered quickly after seeing this film, is either way, don't believe the hype."
1233,7,"My first Harry Potter movie. All I can say is, hype is overrated.","First off, I have read all the Potter books at least four times. I can practically remember every detail in every book. I went into the movie theatre prepared to be disappointed but being a harry potter fan, i couldn't help myself. I saw this movie and loved it. The atmosphere is great and so much better than the ball of fluff the first two movies were. Unlike some people I found the humor to be just right. "
1234,10,Best Ever!!! WARNING-MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS,"Out of every Harry Potter movie I have seen, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best thus far. It fulfilled and exceeded my expectations in each area-it was funny, serious, scary and mature enough to keep me intrigued. It is wonderful to see these young actors taking on roles that in some areas of the world are hard to make believable. With their talents, enthusiasm, apparent dedication to the film and a great script, they have made the Harry Potter series what it has become: something for everyone.I have read the books and I must say it is a true pleasure being able to put characters' names to faces-It makes the reading experience so much better. I give it a 10 out of 10!"
1235,10,Expectations met...,"While I would have liked to see better explanation of the Marauders, I really think this one is a superior movie to the first two. The kids are all getting better, and the CGI this time was wonderful. Buckbeak was breathtaking. The patronus was so well done, and the imagery was just beautiful."
1236,9,Best of the three made so far,"I was disappointed at this movie. As the book is my favorite so far, I expected much more. The casting wasn't great at all, and they missed too many important things, including the explanation of the map. I thought Emma Watson's acting has improved greatly, compared to the annoyance that it was in the first and second movies. The set of Hogwarts, to me, was much better than before. The scenes with Aunt Marge were so much better than I'd expected, and the humor of it was fantastic. I think the change in directors really improved the movie, but the screenplay shouldn't have been like it was. They should not have deleted so much stuff from the book. I thought that some parts should have been changed, but the special effects were better than Columbus' special effects. Overall, it could have been better if Rupert Grint hadn't been so whiny, and the screenplay had been different."
1237,6,Disappointment,The first two tried so hard to follow the books and at first I thought that was how I would like them. But seeing the completely anticlimactic way they told Harry he was a wizard in SS was my first let down. I think this film was adapted pretty well for being such a large book. There were some things I was very disappointed with though such as the total lack of explanation about Moony Wormtail Padfoot and Prongs. I think it was an important part about understanding the relationship between Harry's Dad and his friends. And the lack of explanation about the shreaking shack. And I am not a fan of the actor who played Prof. Lupin. Didn't like him in Dragonheart and don't like him here. The other things I wasn't thrilled about was lack of screentime for Alan Rickman (Snape) and the new actor playing Dumbledore could have been good- had he been given any lines to work with. And lastly I didn't get the feeling that Harry really came to like Prof Lupin or Sirius-it just ended too quickly. On the upside I think the direction was good and the cinematography was great. I think it is the perfect film to introduce younger (age 7 maybe) kids to scary movies. Nothing bloody or gory but good enough effects to provide a jump or 2. Also I think this film had depth since it was filled with a little action with some comic relief. Loved the Knight's bus scene.
1238,,Overall I was happy about how this one turned out.,"Harry Potter 3 was a fantastic movie from all angles. I thought that the new director did a good job for a first time with the series. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson), have also grown into their characters now that they have done this for the past three movies. The movie was a lot darker than the first two but, a lot funnier than the first two. The movie left out a lot of story lines from the book, though. For instance, they left out the quidditch cup final where Gryffindor wins the cup. The dementors looked like ripoffs from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The dementors look exactly like the black riders except, they have ripped robes. Now you can tell that Ron and Hermione are going to be dating pretty soon by the looks of this movie. The movie is an explosive event that is the greatest movie ever made. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, make me give this movie an A+."
1239,,Good 3rd movie.,"As many of the Harry Potter fans, I have waited years to have this movie produced. However I was greatly let down when I saw the movie today. The actors are wonderful and I still have much love for them. Daniel greatly reminded me of the Harry from the book, Emma's character had so much more depth and strength and Rupert was still able to put a smile on my face. However, I strongly believe that Alfonso has disappointed me in the outcome of this movie. The movie was rather choppy and unclear. Much of the main plot was changed from the original book, as well as many places from the original movies were randomly changed. It was a very poor adaptation of the movie. I do not blame the actors because they bring the books to life for me. I did not expect an exact copy of the book when I went to the movie, but I expected better. I was extremely disappointed...I believe that this movie would of greatly succeeded under Chris's directing hands. Chris...Please come back!!!"
1240,5,Chris Columbus....Please Come Back!!,"To tell you the truth i wasn't expecting much from the film, i had always enjoyed the books so much more then i ever did the movies as i never felt they truly explored what it meant to be apart of the magical world that is Harry Potter. This film almost did it, and thats how close a film will ever get to it, because nothing will ever be able to compare to the books. The dark themes were right alongside the simplicity and beauty. It was much more streamlined which helped but at the same time there were the poignant scenes between harry and Lupin. I wish more of a relationship could have developed between Harry and Sirius as that was never really explored but other then that, it kept me captivated."
1241,9,Something Fresh!,"Warning: Possible Spoiller. I don't think what I have to say would spoil the movie, but just in case I want to put it down."
1242,,A 6 out of 10.,I think this movie was good. I thought since it was a new director that it wasn't going to be good but i was wrong. It didn't have that much of the magical experiences but it was good.I like how the did the movie overall. Some people who pay attention to all the details will not like the movie since they did change a lot of the settings.i like how they were trying to show that something was going on between Ron and Hermione. I hate how they did leave out some things from the book.they did leave out some parts that they had in the book. That i thought personally they could have added.For the plot lie they did good even though they didn't put some things in.the graphics were good to Buckbeak was also very good for animation wise.But this movie was the best of the three.
1243,,better then i thought,"This could be construed as having minor spoilers. I found the latest of the Harry Potter films to be very unsatisfying. While the acting was good, the story line was very episodic with no flow that told a coherent story. Too many things were left out such as the winning of the Quidditch cup and the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map. Nothing was said about Sirius giving Harry permission to visit Hogsmeade. Not enough was made of Percy making Head Boy. Other unnecessary scenes were added, The chorus singing near the beginning of the movie was cute, but not pertinent to the story or even derived from the book. The Knight bus scene was too long and some characters changed. I don't remember a hunchback at the Leaky Cauldron. "
1244,6,"Disappointing and unsatisfactory, still better than most of what is out there.","Warning right away that I may say something that might reveal plot. Overall, though, I think that this third installment was a good installment."
1245,,"Better mood, less story","Now the movie in general is good, but if you are a faithful Harry Potter fan there were a number of changes, and not for the better. Completely new sequences were put into the movie that were not in the book, and some scenes that didn't need to be shortened were. As i said before watching it from a different perspective (as in someone who's only read harry potter a couple times) it is a good movie with spectacular special effects and undeniable humor (yay ron!) but i also think some of the casting is shotty. Some of the people (ahem, lupin & sirius) were not as i pictured them, but i suppose some people will not agree. I cant wait for the fourth movie and i really cant wait for the 6th book. I'm shaking with anticipation."
1246,5,"Completely butchered the book, but...",Hi
1247,,poor quality,"It's entertaining, if a bit confusing, to read reviews that praise a director's style while complaining that it's hard to follow the story. One of the things we might ask of a director of a film based on a complex novel is that he or she tell us that story without sacrificing narrative to flashy visuals. If Prisoner of Azkaban is an indication of the route to be taken the ads for the next Harry Potter film will read something like:"
1248,,Rowling! Kloves! Columbus! Take back your movies!,"This movie is visually as stunning as anything I've seen in a long time. I'm excited to see it several more times, and I'm looking forward to Curon's handling of the next movie and more."
1249,8,"Visually stunning, but edited poorly","Warning.. *spoilers* below. Don't read unless you saw the movie or don't care. I confess that I did read the book first and later saw the movie to see how the effects came out and such. The first movie was a pretty good translation and the second wasn't too bad, but the third movie was quite disappointing. The characters also didn't seem to keep they're usual dress routine and started wearing street clothes. I do say that the movie was really sped up much faster than the others as the biggest problem. Guessing how the book had 100 extra pages at least, they had to really squeeze the action to keep a balanced budget. (I wouldn't have minded a longer movie though). In the end, they completely threw out the part were Harry reads his godfather's letter and finds that there is quite a stronger hope for moving away from the Durselys after all. Instead, they put in a new scene were Harry gets the fire bolt (Supposed to be in the middle of the movie!) and flies towards the camera with a hilariously sad fade to credits..."
1250,,Missing Important Scenes,A few things are different in the movie then in the book.
1251,8,Keep an open mind...,"I recently saw a behind the scenes on t.v and heard director Alfonso Cuaron say that when he knew he was to direct he went and read the book through, I'd just like to know what book he was reading because it certainly wasn't the one I'd read several times over. If you haven't read the books then enjoy the film, if you have read the book then go to the cinema with the idea of watching an original version of what you haven't read. All the settings and characters we have enjoyed meeting in the first 2 films are totally turfed out for a darker more depressing feel, gone is Hagrid's cabin across the lawns it now can be found halfway down a mountain, Gone is the fatherly Dumbledore instead he's more like a music hall comedy magician. J.K. Rowling if you have any sympathy for your legions of book fans,oust this director from film 4 before you lose your audience. Of course I will have to buy the films on DVD otherwise you have an incomplete set, which is a very shrewd move on Warners behalf.Go see this at your peril."
1252,5,What has gone wrong?,"Harry Potter is without a doubt the best contemporary fantasy today. The books are yes, better than the movies, but can be brought to life through the films. With that said, I must say that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best film adaption of the current trilogy. The actors were amazing; the set, as much as it changed, was fulfilling; the story was faithful despite minor alterations; and lastly, the wizard world was greatly explored. I gave it a 10/10 for it lived up to all expectations quite dutifully."
1253,10,Great Progression,This movie was made for those who haven't read the books. If it were a stand alone movie instead of one in the middle of a series it might not be so bad. Unfortunately for Harry Potter fans it is one from the middle of the series. When the series is done and you sit down to watch them one after the other this one will be a jarring note. Hogwarts has been changed inside and out. Even poor professor Flitwick doesn't look like himself.
1254,5,Very disappointing,"I've seen this movie after seeing ""Spider-Man 2"", and in my opinion this is a much better ""fantasy"" movie. While Spider-Man attempts to ground the fantasy aspect amidst everyday real-life situations, this move is not encumbered by any such goals. Its a fantasy movie through and through. It therefore succeeds in making the audience suspend their disbelief far better than Spider-Man, making it enjoyable escapist fare. I certainly did not want to leave the theatre after, I wanted to linger in that world of magic for just a little bit longer. I suppose I have to wait for the next installment of Harry Potter."
1255,,A Film with true Magic,"Prisoner of Azkaban exceeds its predecessors in almost all respects, which isn't to say that Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were bad, just that this is better. The acting from all concerned is top notch (especially Thewlis as Professor Lupin) - the young actors have come on leaps and bounds from their previous efforts - and the special effects are so much more realistic (who can say Buckbeak is awful?). What impressed me most though, is the way the whole idea of magic is portrayed: whereas Chris Columbus presented it as some wondrous, awe-inspiring thing that has to be marveled at at all opportunities, Alfonso Cuaron let's the camera just glide by, as if seeing a spoon stirring itself or pouring a cuppa from a teapot suspended in midair are completely normal, everyday things!"
1256,9,A large improvement,"Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie of 2004! Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent actor and did well in this movie. I love this movie and the people in it! I feel so sorry for anybody who does not like Harry Potter or hasn't seen this movie yet. I can't wait until The Goblet of Fire is released! I know that it's going to be even better than The Prisoner of Azkaban, if that is possible! My favorite character is Daniel Radcliffe. I think he's so hot but none of my friends do! They all say I'm weird for liking him but I think that they are weird. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite movie and I'm obsessed with Lord of the Rings and the Butterfly Effect but The Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the best movie that I have ever seen!"
1257,,The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie!,"I beg to differ from the people who think that Harry Potter is just a child's' movie. While the storyline may be designed for children, I know of many adults who have enjoyed all three films so far."
1258,,Bloody Brilliant,"When I first found out that a Mexican was directing the third installment in the phenomenal ""potter"" series was kind of a shock,a good one that is.Alfonso Cuaron directing the beautiful ""a little princess"" and the sexy ""y tu mama tambien"" has crafted a fantasy story worth remembering."
1259,10,Pure magic and a lot more mischief.,"Okay, there is not a bigger ""Harry Potter"" fan out there but me. However, the energy and time I have put into reading and watching the books and movies feels like rubbish. I believe that the ""different approach"" by Alfonso Cauron couldn't have been worse. It came out on June 4th and I went to see it on July 29th. Your probably thinking ""some big fan"" but believe me, I am. Yes, in the fourth book J.K. Rowling shows a little spark going on between Ron and Hermione, yet, that is no excuse for putting such garbage in the movie of their friendship, such as; the part when Hagrid's hippogriff (Buckbeak) ""supposedly"" dies, Hermione rests her head against Ron's shoulder and clings onto his neck, then, Harry puts his arms around her. HOW LAME!!!!!! I hated it. I was THIS close to throwing my shoe at the big screen. Yes, most people do like the ""new approach"" by Mr. Cauron, yet, I believe he has changed my whole view of ""Harry Potter"" movies from ""good"" to ""horrible."" I personally think he should simply STOP making the movies of ""Harry Potter"" anymore because he will make me not want to read the upcoming 6th book."
1260,,A snort of disappointment,I really cannot understand the number of people complaining how disappointed they were with this wonderful third installment of the HP movies.
1261,,Stop complaining!!,"Hello! I want to first say that I'm not some twenty year old here to pick apart the movie, just a fifteen year old girl with the common persons review. Well, i liked it. Although it didn't perfectly follow the book (what movie does?) it was good. Here were some things i Didn't like though:"
1262,10,It was nice,"I have read the book not to long ago. It was very interesting to find the the movie is missing loads of important details. It was a small disappointment to see that the movie only had a fraction of the details that the book had. I am hoping that when the goblet of fire is finished that it matches the book a lot more then this one did. I have read the goblet of fire as well and I could not put it down. I have a feeling that this movie to will be a bit of a disappointment. I do think that the actors and actresses are great but I don't think that this movie was put together that well. I think that the director could have done a better job at putting the movie together. To be completely honest, the movie left me a bit confused as to what has going on and how thing had happened. All in all, I hope the the next one will be a lot better."
1263,,Small disappointment,"I thought that out of all three of the Harry Potter films, this was the worst, not because of the story or the acting, but because it was simply the worst adaptation of the book."
1264,4,Worst of all the movies,This movie was great! The kids get better and better in the acting. they were a lot less tense this time around. I feel like a dork cuz I am 21 and like the Harry Potter movies. I never read the books but if they are like the movies they are great. J.K. Rawling has a very wild imagination. It would be great if we could all have friends like those 3. The effects in it are great. The scenery is awesome too. The bird type creature cracks me up. I think I would have a heart attack if I ever seen one of those. It would be great to fly on though. Whoever did they casting in these movies sure did pick a great Harry Potter. Looks just like him. He is adorable.
1265,10,This movie was excellent!!!,"I could not disagree more with the review done by ladypythia. I am a humongous Harry Potter fan and was not disappointed. Granted some plot points were left out of the movie. However this is the fault of the studio who insisted on cutting and cutting, and the fault of the people who chose a person who was not interested in the Harry Potter world to direct. Cuaron did a good job, but had never even read the books before being asked to direct. He could have made the movie more all inclusive and from what I heard he did shoot more footage, but it all got cut. All in all I think what you get here is the best harry potter movie of the three in spite of all this. The mood that was created was better than the others and it sets the tone for the fourth movie which should be longer and more inclusive. Also, the issues that were left out are for the die hard harry potter fans, but for those who just want to see the movie and keep up they wont sit through a 3 and a half hour movie. So it had to be left with what it was to ensure that it would appeal to a broader spectrum of viewers."
1266,9,Disagree with review,"don't get me wrong. i LOVE the harry potter series. i haven't fully enjoyed the movies as muck as the books, but this one has hit an all time low. the third movie has a new director. and he got the whole harry potter thing wrong. i should know, after reading each book 20+ times. first of all, he makes the night bus sequence all wrong. there is NO shrunken head no the bus, and when the night bus travels through the world, it doesn't get smaller as it runs into objects. the objects jump out of the way. second of all, the characters act all different than how Miss J.K Rowling portrays them in the books. thirdly, the quiddich scene sucks. the other guys did a much better job. doing the quiddich scenes. fourthly, why didn't he put cho Chang in the movie! she was an important part of the third book! fifthly, harry potter CRIES during the movie where in hell did THIS ALPHONSO GUY GET THE IDEA THAT HARRY SHOULD CRY DURING THE DAMN MOVIE! he does get one thing right though. the magical creatures look awesome this time around. the Dementors, Buckbeak, and Werewolf Lupin are portrayed perfectly. that is the only thing saving this movie from a two. i do not recommend this movie. if you wan't a good cinematic harry potter experience, watch harry potter one and two. it gets a five, out of ten"
1267,5,watch the others. they are BETTER!,"Harry, Ron and Hermione are growing up, in this film. In fact i thought this was the best out of the three films. For a stat, the narrative of the film, and the plot change near the end. Completely twisting at the end was a good way in the book, and works even better on film."
1268,8,Good Movie....,"I went to the Theater in the hopes of another great adaptation of J.K. Rowlings fantastic series and came away somewhat disappointed. There was so much that had been left out of the movie. Gryffindor winning the quidditch cup, Ron and Harry having a huge fight with Hermione over the Firebolt and refusing to even speak with her, The significance of Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. The movie left you wondering how Professor Lupin knew that the map was even a map, or how he knew to work it. Harry attacks Snape in the shrieking shack and the school year just continues on for him? Snape does nothing about it? On another note I felt that the acting jobs of the three main characters was done fairly well. Emma Watson seems to be leading the pack in acting abilities and I wish that screenwriters would allow Rupert's character to develop more fully. In the books Ron is a colorful and fun character and is a great contrast to both Harry and Hermione. As for the newly added cast, David Thewlis did a terrible job as Professor Lupin, but I suspect that has more to do with a poor choice of Director, rather than Thewlis' acting abilities. I do actually like the additional scenes of the school, the showing of the grounds, etc. It gives Hogwarts more the feel of a real place. I have since watched the movie a couple of times on DVD at home and have become more comfortable with it, but no matter what I do I can't get past Lupin's rushed lines in his various discussions with Harry. Sorry but it really lowered my opinion of the movie."
1269,6,"As a movie, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban' falls somewhat short of the novel.","I think that this movie shows A lot of potential and I really enjoyed watching it. I mean the fact that someone can do magic is a little unrealistic but it fun! And it makes want to believe. Actually it MAKES you believe. The graphics were also amazing and the casting, it couldn't have been better! It also followed the basics of the book and also had character building, in which I mean you could tell that the actors really felt their characters. For anyone who hasn't watched the movie I suggest you watch and the first 2 movies as well, you should also read the books, they are amazing! (There are currently 6 of them) I hope that you enjoy Harry Potter as much as I did!"
1270,10,Harry Potter,"Well, it's difficult to find any words for the film Alfonso Cuarón made of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. I had so many many expectations to this adaptation from  for me the best of JK Rowlings novels  that book so i feared it would become as boring as his predecessors are."
1271,9,From a sorcerer's student to his master... followed by a try to describe what magic is....,Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite book of the series and is also my favourite film of the series.
1272,10,Best film of the series,"This potter film i believe went downhill from the first two. I believe that warner brothers should have never changed directors. I had many problems with this installment. Me being a Potter fan myself i had an idea about what this film would look like. I am sad to say that many portions of the film were not only done wrong but out of time sequence, there was also a lot of things missing from this film that could have been done if other minor parts were left out."
1273,6,Could of been better,"I am an avid reader and I really liked the Harry potter books. I was very very excited when I heard that warner bros. were going to film the movies. The first two were exceptional and lived up to my expectations. But.... the third one was waaaaaay below the standards set by the first two. B/c ,first, the acting was horrible,second, the geography was nothing like the other movies, third, none of the big aspects of the book were explained. People who have not read the book do not know why the stag came in Harry's patronus or what wormttail exactly did. The direction, screenplay, writing and editing were very poor. I give this HP movie a generously kind 3 out of 10."
1274,2,"extremely disappointing, in other words... it stank","Harry Potter was not specifically designed for the cinema, that is why adapting a Harry Potter book for the big screen was, in itself, a challenge. The first two of the movies were quite faithful to the book, but took the time to show some details of the world of HP, for example life at school or others things that were not indispensable to understand the story completely. With the change of the director (Cuaron replaces Colombus) comes a change in the way the story is set up for the screen. Cuaron didn't think it was necessary to keep the previous details, in order to focus exclusively on the story. It might be a bit embarrassing for the people who are not familiar with the atmosphere of Harry Potter, but for the other it is really efficient: The story turns to be more intensive and breath-taking. Nothing to say about the actors, they are mainly the same than in the previous movies. A last word concerning the music: when will Williams retire??? He could have composed a much more interesting music, given what he'd written in the past!"
1275,6,"The Best ""Harry Potter"" among the first ones","At first, I didn't care for it. Too many things taken out and the plot was almost ruined."
1276,7,A really good movie,"Oh My Gosh! Why did they get rid of Christopher Columbus?! This movie has lost the charm of the rest of the Harry Potter movies. It doesn't help that Alfonso Cuaron never read the book! The one and only part that I liked was the Patronus charm, which earned 4 stars. The other one was for Alfonso Cuaron's Effort and the fabulous soundtrack by John Williams. I hope that the Goblet of Fire will be better. The Maruder's Map was cool. I do recommend the video game. I think this movie is worth seeing, even though I was disappointed. The bonus disc on the DVD has lots of cool activities. I hope Mike Newell will use Chris Columbus' style."
1277,5,A disappointment,"This was the best movie from the Harry Potter series. In fact it was also the best book. In the beginning, the part where they show you that Harry is reading in the Dursleys' home was kind of a lame part. What was the point of it? When Aunt Marge showed up it was an upsetting, yet funny part. It was upsetting because it would make you feel sorry for Harry because his parents are dead and no someone just makes fun of them because they are mean. Funny because Aunt Marge gets blown up.When he runs away and sees the dog it was a little freaky, especially if you haven't read the book. "
1278,10,Harry Potter 3 was the best movie from series,I'm sorry i thought this movie was horrible. The director ruined it! From what i can tell lots of other people agree with me. Anyone who thought this director was good or have read the books and liked it is a complete moran! Where was Cho Chang? Dementors don't fly they glide!!!! I for one am glad the director is going. CHRIS COLUMBUS WE NEED YOU I CANT STAND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! The actors were superb as always. What the heck is with these regular clothes? What happened to McGonagall taking the firebolt? Where is Pig? Ron needs more lines!!!!!!!!! Wasn't Hermione supposed to have a breakdown? Wasn't Ron and Hermione supposed to have a huge fight? Wasn't Malfoy and his crew supposed to come on to the quidditch pitch as dementors? HELLO!!!! This movie was ruined!!! The head on the knight bus? Harry was supposed to fret about the grim!!! Where was Dumbledore at the end! I used to be like glued to these books now i am more than ever!!!!! Checking their faults. Hogsmeade wasn't as i imagined it but i can deal. What happened to the grounds? Hagrids hut was closer to the water there were no hills. Hermione didn't wolf call so lupin would leave sirius alone!!!! Well I was really disappointed. I'm so ready for the new director!
1279,,HORRIBLE,"I loved it It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry."
1280,9,Daniella,"Wacky atmosphere, lacking scenario, pathetic villains (speaking of Draco & Co, the Dursleys, Aunt Marge) and generally bad directing  especially regarding kids, Peter Pettigrew and Emma Thompson. It's clear that it's difficult to say at the tender age of 10-11 years if some kid will be able to act at all . Nevertheless, there are no excuses for letting a generally good actress entirely out of control. It was as if Mrs. Thompson played in a different movie. Thanks God there were also Allan Rickman, Gary Oldman and David Thwelis, so the movie wasn't completely ruined."
1281,,Disappointing,"When I saw the first two films I thought something along the lines of: ""Wow, they've brought this over to film very authentically to the book"" When I saw this film, I realised how much there was that I didn't even know I was missing. This film is grittier (in every way - even the kids are dirtier) and more realistic (I know - for a fantasy film)."
1282,9,Surprisingly better than the first two,"This movie was great, dark like the book and the cinematography was spectacular. Harry's ride on Buckbeak was amazing except for the Titanic-esquire part. (Cheesiest part since the freeze-frame ending to Philosopher's stone!) I really liked how they animated the map. Only thing I find missing is an explanation of the Marauders and why they had the nicknames they had. Everyone I know who hasn't read the book was confused by that and the stag at the end makes no sense unless you know who ""Prongs"" is! They should have Alfonzo Cuoron back to do more! He did a much better job than Chris Columbus and I think he got the tone of the book down pat!"
1283,9,the best harry potter movie so far,"... he delivered the first entry in the Harry Potter series, that turns out to be areal movie! And what a brilliant movie. Gone are all the ludicrous CGI-moments from the first two movies, what we get are flawless and sometimes amazing effects with one or two exceptions **spoilers start like the werewolf-scenes. But even the are not too bad. But the way, the movie depicts the meandering and moving set af the Shrieking Shack, the horrifying dementors and some other creatures is just incredible! ** spoilers end Where the first two movies apologized their lengths with ""sticking to the books"", the script here is fast-paced, clever and atmospheric. Where most oft the roles in HP 1 and 2 felt like ""cameos"", the cast is superb in this one, even the kids are not only delivering their lines, but acting all the way. Kudos to Alfonso Cuarón!"
1284,9,Cuarón is a real Whizard ...,"The mise-én-scene of Harry Potter Happiness can be found, in the darkest of times, if one simply remembers to turn on the light. Welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter! Our feature presentation is Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. It is Harry's third year at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is a thirteen year old boy, shaping his future while learning more and more about his dark and heroic past. ""A true kid's classic is just as magical for adults. "" Says Peter Rainer of the New York Magazine. But just how was it created so that adults sit spell bounded in their seats. Enchanted.... Charmed.... Bewitched.... If it weren't for the excellent use of mise-én-scene, it probably wouldn't be the same. No, my fellow Harry Potter fan, mise-én-scene is not a spell, nor is it the name of a character or actor. It is the thaumaturgy of the director and the Director of Photography; it is the sum and substance of the directors' wits that draws you attention to the screen. Mise-én-scene was originally a French theatrical term that meant ""placing on stage"". It is the use of many different elements in movies, kind of like painting a picture on the closed space of the canvas and placing objects appropriately where they belong. Some elements of mise-én-scene amongst the hundred of others used on the set of Harry Potter are composition and design, territorial space, and the superb use of proxemic use of proxemic patterns."
1285,10,The Film maker's aspect of the wondorous world of Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry Potter (Danielle Radcliffe), Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) have returned to their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And yet again, Harry's life seems to be in great danger from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), a prisoner who has most recently escaped from Azkaban in order to kill Harry for He-who-must-not-be-named. It also seems that the school has become under the protection of hundreds of Dementors from Azkaban. Soon Harry realizes that things may not go as they planned for him or his friends either."
1286,8,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"For the most part this was an OK movie, but not as good as the first two. Without reveling plot points the movie was a trimmed down version of the book; however, the new director took too many liberties with the local geography. The next items are not spoilers in plot, but in scenery. The Griffindor Entrance, which was in a hall in the first two movies, is now in front of a staircase. Haggrid's house and the whomping willow, which were originally a few yards from the castle, are now way down a hill that is accessed via a bridge not shown in the first two movies or mentioned in the books. If you are rigid about detail and continuity of movies in a series then this will take away from the movie. The characters are required to show a little more acting range than before and their is a big difference in their appearances now that are a year older which adds to the movie. I'd give it two and half out of four stars."
1287,,Too many geography changes.,"I saw this film while in NY this past weekend with my daughter and best friend, and it was great. It did leave out some of the details of the book that will make true Harry Potter fans find it somewhat lacking but it had some awesome special effects and a nice plot twist or two thrown in. There's not so much focus on their studies and Hermione's part is more minor than I expected. It was enjoyable and I would go see it again. My daughter loved it as she loved the first two and Malfois get smacked for his insults as I've been desiring to do myself. There was a bird / pegasus creature in there that was interesting. And yet another glimpse of Muggle London life in comparison with the magical lifestyle. The characters are more down to earth in this film and you learn still more about Harry's parents, and the past. Overall, a worthy to see at the theater's film, and I don't say that about too many movies."
1288,,Great New Harry Potter film with awesome special effects,"Overall, I didn't mind the movie. I mean, once again, the visual effects, acting etc. were very good. But the most disappointing part was the fact that they changed the set. For example, the books say the Whomping Willow is a tree by itself in the middle of the grounds, and it was in the 1st and 2nd movies, whereas here it was in the middle of the forbidden forest (and even that wasn't scary, eg. where they met Buckbeak). And since when did dementors fly?? Also, i can't believe that the director left out Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup, that is such an amazingly happy and brilliant part of the movie. "
1289,6,"Good, but too much changed/left out","Taking this film on its own, not as the third film in the series or as an adaptation of a book this would be excellent. It has a good story, though as mentioned later it is full of holes, great acting and some good set pieces. But as an adaptation and a third film it is very disappointing."
1290,6,"A fun film if you have not read the book, a let down if you have","This film was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The credits should have read ""LOOSELY based on the novel by J.K. Rowling."" If you're a fan of the books, don't waste your money on this film. The film itself was okay, but VERY different from the book and VERY different from the first two films. Sure, the first two films were a little different from the books, but nothing like the most recent film. There are many big differences between the film & the book (i.e. how/when Harry acquires the Firebolt). The sequence of events & how things happen are quite messed up. Harry didn't face the boggart during class (in the book), so why does he in the movie? Also, whatever happened to Crookshanks later in the movie? "
1291,,VERY DISAPPOINTED!! (Spoiler),Repeat: The film is not the same as the book.
1292,8,The fun keeps rolling on,A massive improvement on The Chamber of Secrets which I found seriously disappointing. Although Master Radcliffe's voice has broken it doesn't appear to have improved his acting ability.
1293,,It's surprisingly good!,"The 3rd movie was absolutely phenomenal! Cuarón made the actors' (esp. EMMA, Daniel, Rupert, Tom) true abilities evident, and the cinematography was enthralling! I thought the first two movies were good, but after PoA...GoF has some big shoes to fill, movie-wise (not to mention living up to the book)!"
1294,,PoA is Absolutely Phenomenal,"This was the first of the Harry Potter books that I read after seeing the first two movies. My son read the book, so I picked it up to make sure he read it, and was really good. The two parts that were missing I though were important and easy to do so I don't understand why they were left out! The first, is no explanation of how they know Sirius Black set up the Potters. The second was the Marauders Map, how did Prof. Lupin know how to use it. That shows just how close the four friends really were and why everyone thought that Black was so evil their nicknames on the map were not even mentioned. Hopefully, that will be on the DVD. Otherwise it was very good."
1295,7,Missed two important parts,"You expect to be disappointed by a much awaited and hyped new release, but 10 minutes in and I knew this was a great film. Radcliffe really can act, depending on the situation he appears like a young boy, someone bearing a heavy burden, an angry teenager...It's fairly creepy, I would be wary of taking young children, particularly if they haven't read the book. The film is liberated from the confines of the school, very little happening in the classroom. Cuaron certainly wields his own magic on the film even doing well incorporating the effects (something he is not known for) smoothly. The Knight Bus sequence is fun and thrilling, and there is a lot to laugh at without breaking the mystery. This is my favourite Potter book, but the film did not let me down. The plot concentrates on the more important characters, most of the other pupils are just background. I would quite happily have sat in the cinema all day. Mike Newell, you have a hard act to follow."
1296,10,"All aboard, a blockbuster directed by a true director","'Harry potter and the prisoner of Azerbaijan' as well as all the other movies of harry potter have been fabulous.i have really enjoyed seeing the movies as well as reading the books.While reading harry potter books ,i just drift into another world away from this real world.I MUST CONFESS that I'm a great fan of J.K ROWLING ,the character HARRY POTTER and DANIEL RADCLIFFE.In fact i would really like it if Daniel becomes my friend and mails me at ash_4_u_2@yahoo.com.In fact i liked all the characters ,specially harry's friends ,Hermione and Ron."
1297,10,The best!,"This film was fabulous, it is 1 of my favourite!!!! Harry Potter books mean so much to me and this film stayed close to it unlike the 4thfilm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if u haven't seen this film WATCH IT NOW PLLLEEEEZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1298,10,Fabulous,"I don't understand why so many people aren't pleased with this movie, I think the other 2 movies don't even compare with this one."
1299,8,Surprise,Most definitely not. Not even in the general vicinity. Think interstellar distances. 
1300,,This is a movie? (spoilers within),"i was one of those readers who fell into the magic of hogwarts and loved the childish scenes portrayed in the first two movies. The quiddich scenes, the jovial music and overall juvenile feeling made those first two movies special. Now, with the third movie and a different director, you can expect a very different story. Apparently harry isn't a kid anymore because we aren't allowed to enjoy the movies like we enjoyed the books. not only is there a totally different feel, but the actions in the movie are jittery and some scenes are almost scary. The third movie completely changed the way hogwarts looks and how the grounds look. The new castle has this feeling of darkness, not the overwhelming happiness that harry originally felt by coming to hogwarts. I have seen the movie a few times since the first viewing, and i will admit it has grown on me. The new style is definitely an art, and should be respected. It is just sad to me that the magic of hogwarts will never appear the same.."
1301,7,overall displeased..but it grew on me,"I just saw the new Harry Potter movie today, and although I liked it, it had a very different feel to it. Even my son noted that Hagrids Hut had been moved, the area surrounding the school looked very different, etc...I own all the books and the first 2 movies on DVD and have watched them numerous times, and it was strange to see Hermione, Harry and Ron in street clothes as opposed to their school robes. The quidditch match was VERY short, and Cho was not mentioned at all. The way one would stop the Whomping Willow was changed from pushing a stump to using a spell and wand, and Draco went from being a villain worthy of Harry to a wimp in one film. I felt the time travel aspect of the film was reminiscent of Back To The Future II, whereas I didn't get that feeling reading the book. I'll always be a fan, but I enjoyed the look and feel of the first 2 films more than this one, and hope the author retains the control for the fourth film that she obviously didn't for this one, as Goblet of Fire was my favorite harry potter book so far, and I'd hate to see it condensed to the extent that this one was."
1302,,This had a different feel...,"First, I must say I was really impressed by Alfonso Cuaron's vision of the Harry Potter's world. I read and loved all of the 5 books but disliked the first 2 films by Chris Colombus : in my opinion, there was no real adaptation work on these 2 ; they were nothing but a flat and scholar illustration of the books without any drama or flavor. With the same kind of original material and the same scriptwriter, you can have total crap or absolute grace. That's why the director makes all the difference to me ! To adapt a novel, I think you have to make it yours by being deeply moved and inspired by it. You'll have to make choices in the process and take liberties with the written material. This way, the movie may have its own atmosphere, making sense as a stand-alone work of art."
1303,,A New Hope * SPOILER *,In case you didn't know.
1304,,"Just so you know, it was great.","I love the Harry Potter books, and I was thrilled with the first two movies. Except for Fawkes, who looks like a musclebound chicken, I thought that the producers had done an amazing job of bringing JK Rowling's vision to the screen. I"
1305,,A HUGE Disappointment,"This movie was disappointing in that it left out large chunks of the story. Granted, it was a long movie without the missing parts, but frankly, the unexplained portions will make it somewhat confusing to people who have not read the book, and made the pace seem odd. Also, many of the things that were left out set the stage for the subsequent installments. They also made dramatic changes to ground of Hogwarts, which play havoc with the continuity of the series. That said, the kids were all wonderful, and despite the cast changes, I always enjoy Dawn French and Robert Hardy. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie, but all the changes and incongruities were distracting."
1306,,I was disappointed by this movie.,I've never read any of the Potter books (yet). I enjoyed the first two movies but was disappointed by the last. The only thing I enjoyed about this one was the music really.
1307,,Lacks coherence and direction: least of the Potter movies,"It skipped some major scenes, and I didn't particularly like some of the actors. The special effects, though, were AMAZING. All of the scenes in town were pretty good. My personal favorite was Honeydukes. There was some added stuff, but it didn't matter much to me. The amount of shrunken heads, however, confused me, especially the ones that stopped Hermione and Ron from entering the Three Broomsticks. Maybe my memory isn't too good, but I don't remember that many heads in the book. Or any, for that matter. I can't say much more without spoiling a lot, so I'll stop here. But it was worth seeing, being my favorite of the books."
1308,6,Not the best of the series.,"An eagerly awaited treat to be treasured in the collection. Partly because of what it is;- the third film of the most exciting ""children's"" story in modern times and therefore a must have if you are following the adventure. (I am 46 but that is not old for a child........) A fabulous book needs a fabulous film to re-create it perfectly, a very difficult job. But then, if you are eagerly following as I am, there were slight disappointments. Unavoidable as it is, I feel Michael Gambon is only a substitute Dumbledore, not the real thing. Not his fault, it would have worked fine if he had been in from the start, it is the sad fact that he had to pick up where others left off. If only he had stuck with his own wonderful speaking voice and not used an Irish accent the exchange might not have been so noticeable. Other differences stood out rather glaringly, the alteration in position for Hagrid's shack gave us all a jolt. My friends and I felt there was rather too much attention to scene setting at the expense of the plot - why could we not have been told who Messrs Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs were, for instance? Why did not the children "
1309,,"Pleased,touched with slight disappointments","I liked the movie a lot because of the change. Overall, there are some characters that have changed like all of the main characters that are Harry, Ron and Hermione who are 13 but look bigger. For example, one of the changes could be that Neville Longbottom has lost some weight. Draco Malfoy also has changed because he also looks bigger. By the way, I loved the change that Alfonso Cuarón made to this movie and that is why I rated it 8/10."
1310,8,Changed Characters,"Oh my God, it was horrible! First, this man (Cuaron) is a professional director?! I could've done better than that! And it was way to ""artsy""! Like the leaf falling from the tree and the rest of the crap! What's with that!? I wanted to see a Harry Potter movie, not some crazy movie on Sundance about a Goth chick finding love (or whatever)."
1311,5,Harry Potter is a teenager and seriously finds out more about his parents' past.,This is a awesome movie of whole fantasy eorld for kid and family it have mind blowing next level graphic .......
1312,8,Famliy,"I like Fantasy movie or movie about magic ,supernatural. so l like this movie all part.every time I watch this movie,I never bored. It's very amazing .i really enjoyed all part. the backdrops ,light,sound, Effects. it's very good and make me feel like I can Dropped in the movie really. I'm big fan of this movie. I've been watching it throughout the school holidays. But my best part of Harry Potter is part 3 or Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I like every scene of this story. Example, Double decker bus, magic shop in LonDon, the magic village near Hogwarts and more. That's so impressived. All the great scenes. For me, I think the plot is interesting. The actors is very good. In addition make up and costume is very nice,beautiful . Excellent design. Harry Potter movies is my favorite movie forever."
1313,10,My bast part of this movie,"The story is good (of course not identical to the book but then for me part of the fun is discussing how I would have included bits the director didn't), scenery is breathtaking, and the acting is excellent. I know people have said it is scarier than the previous two but to be honest I found the second film with the spiders and big snake scarier. The dementors really just looked like bits of torn material floating around. I took my 8 month old she spent the first half of the movie transfixed."
1314,,I loved it,My favorite episode of harry potter series.
1315,10,The best,Amazing.arry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)arry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)arry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)
1316,10,Amazing,"The sets were totally different from the previous two movies. Hogwarts appeared to be smaller, even the Great Hall seems smaller. The location of the school was inconsistent with with previous movies. The landscape is completely different, with the Whomping Willow on a cliff instead of on flat ground next to the school; Hagrids hut is down in a valley at the bottom a series of stairs when it was just outside an entrance to the school on flat ground and I recall no pendulum at the school. "
1317,,Lacks continuity with the previous movies,"I thought this movie was very good, considering they went and got themselves a new director. The way the movie transitioned and went from scene to scene was pretty well, nothing was dragged out or moved too fast. The only thing that I thought was silly was the end when they froze on Harry's face when he was riding the broom XD Hahahaha, but hey it is a movie meant for kids, so who cares if its childish :) It overall was great though in my opinion. Sure everything that was in the book wasn't included, but thats understandable because if they stayed faithful to the book, then well you know, it would end up 16 hours long or something, so they did fine with what they had. They kept you wondering and interested about what was going to happen next (for those who didn't read the book) and wondering just what it is that certain monsters or spells do. Of course, all of it eventually gets answered anyway, so its all good n gravey, and pretty much all of your questions (or mine were) answered by the end. I dunno why you'd go and strain yourself over something like that anyway, and go out of your way to find some unanswered question or something wrong. You can't ever really bottle perfection, and sometimes just have to be happy with what you have."
1318,9,In Contrast to the other Summary...,I think it's safe to say this is the best film in the series. The direction/aesthetic plus John William's final score are absolute fantastic. I can't believe they'll studio never tried to bring Alfonso or John back again.
1319,10,The best,Warning: Spoilers!
1320,,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of...Cuaron,"This was a really good movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I have watched it about 5 times now. The story lines are engaging.I would say that the acting is phenonmenon. I am glad that Harry Potter is growing up so now that he can fight evil like a man. The 2 other characters are very entertaining. Omini and the red head boy. I am so glad they picked these three kids to be in the movie. I heard that there was a major attack on the Asian girl playing Harry potter's new girlfriend. I don't understand what the jealousy is about, if you really take a good perspective, harry potter, the real boyis still single, he is now the richest young man in the UK and yes, you have a chance to marry him, but you might have to fly out there to meet him first!http://localsandtourist.blogspot.com/"
1321,9,Excellent Movie!,"I believe that this film is a turning point in the entire series of films . Both the film and the book exalt a fair amount of drama and darkness into the world of good magic. Movies stop being so colorful and a certain gloom appears. This film is like a transition from childhood and unrestrained fun to the youth of the characters, where the responsibility they bear for their actions already appears. I also liked the way the new character played the villain. After all, I think we all thought to the end that Sirius is an evil hero. In general, I advise everyone to watch."
1322,10,Childhood is over...,"By this point the series has found its place between dark and light, fear and wonder, childhood and adulthood, strangeness and conventionality. Cuarón is an excellent director who can seemingly take on any film that comes his way, and, as with every film in the series, there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is shown only glimpses, but she is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition, and the appearance of Dementors marks one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-filled creations. Compared to the first two films, the film has taken away some of the fat, but it's still too long--otherwise, it's probably a series at its peak."
1323,10,I loved this movie really much,"The third Harry Potter movie is without a doubt the best of the lot. In it, the heroes are revealed from the best sides, showing their unity and love for their neighbors, ingenuity, the ability to objectively assess reality and make informed decisions. The young wizards are no longer children, so they have to face more serious responsibility, they had to prevent the death of several innocent lives. In this part, they learn independence and grow up. At the same time, fascinating scenes and a time-traveling story thought out to the smallest detail amaze the viewer and capture the magical world throughout the entire viewing."
1324,10,Amazing film!!!!,"i love harry potter saga!! the books are beautiful, the movie are gorgeous!! this one is the best of the trio, i think that the director is a genius because has made a masterpiece!! of course, the one and the second are beautiful, but this one is my favorite!! and now i'm waiting for the goblet of fire, that will be amazing of course!! but talking about the prisoner, i think that Dan, Rup and Emma are very very good, and i absolutely love Sirius-Oldman!!is too good!!he is the best actor for the part of Sirius!! ending, i absolutely love the harry potter world, and i have to thank Joanne k. Rowling because she had created this beautiful world!! sorry for my English, bye bye!!"
1325,10,the best in the world,"Thank goodness for the new director on this one! We get a more realistic setting (as Hogwart's actually looks like it's in Scotland and not in some large bland flat cartoony field), more realistic teens (note variances in students' ties... do you honestly think youths would be able to properly tie their own ties perfectly? I like this touch, along with other similar ones), properly used CG (physical effects were used more, allowing computer effects to really shine when employed), and a new musical theme that also utilizes the old to emphasize change between this movie and the last two."
1326,,A Much Improved Addition to the Series...,"I must say I was very pleasantly surprised at this latest installment of the HarrY Potter series. I know that many Harry Potter Fans are pounding the table about not staying true to the first film or staying accurate to the book, but once again , this is NOT the book. It is very difficult to translate every single line, every single situation from the book to the screen. First off as many would wish to believe that the film needs to take the same route as the first two films I HEARTILY disagree. The first two films got Me interested in this series, but they seemed more like a ""kiddie"" film and I think this newest foray into Harry Potter, it its headed in the right direction making the film much more appealing to movie goers of ALL ages. Alfonso Cuarón did a magnificent job in bringing an edge to the film and to begin bringing the dark shadow of future events slowly into focus, but not delving too deeply into the darker edges just yet. If there is any issues that I have with the film is that in many spots the storyline did move a bit fast for Me. If I didn't know the films or the story that well, there are a number of explanations that were either very briefly visited or were insufficient to explain certain events farther into the film. I believe this is more a problem with a decision about how long the film would take and most likely many of these issues were edited out(hopefully) to keep the film's running time down. The explanation about the makers of the Marauder's map, more of an explanation of the events surroundings His parents death, the time traveling Hermione had been doing. Hopefully these explanations will make it to the DVD of this film and they take heade of this fact when putting together ""Goblets of Fire"". All in all a very good and promising film, much better atmosphere than the first two, but a more darker edge to them. After all the author of the book was also very pleased with the overall direction this film has taken, so that in itself is a good sign."
1327,,"Very Nice Transition, But still needs work","I'm not a fan of Harry Potter. I read the first book and it was fairly enjoyable but by the time I got halfway through the second I had experienced too many feelings of deja vu to want to continue. I saw the first two movies with the kids and was distinctly underwhelmed by the experience. Again, the first much hyped film struggled to be average and the second film felt like a rehash of the first. "
1328,9,Huge improvement,"Played by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Gary Oldman, the soundtrack was written by John Williams and is based on the novel written by J. K Rowling Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."
1329,10,A dark and a mysterious film,"I know many people think that Prisoner of Azkaban was a great film and I agree that it was visually stunning, well directed, and much more mature than either of the previous films. There's more to a movie than that, though, especially this movie. Prisoner of Azkaban is an adaption of a book, part of a larger series, and ,most importantly, already extremely popular and well known. It is also the favorite of the series (so far) among the majority of those I have asked. There were many important issues to consider when making this movie."
1330,6,Where did the story go?,"The Harry Potter movie series, so far, stands among only a few movie series that have improved with each successive film--the Evil Dead series and The Man With No Name trilogy to name two others. Chris Columbus, director of the first two films, gained a steadier grasp on his material with the second film, but it was Cuaron, director of this third, that moved the series into a much needed different direction."
1331,8,A welcome rejuvenation,The Movie starts off really good. New style and a more grown up look. The Plot starts off right and fits into the Universe and bigger story it is trying to tell. It is in the Second half of the Movie where the questions starts to arise.
1332,3,Good cinematography with an absolutely horrible plot,With much anticipation I went to see PoA last night. Feelings mixed.
1333,,A mixed bag of bullseye's and humbugs,"Cuaron is the best thing that happened to the Harry Potter series. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" is darker then the other two Potter installments, which is important for the subject matter of the film. ""Stone"" and ""Secrets"" were too cheesy concentrating too much on little details within the stories. Although ""Azkaban"" differs in many way from the book, it is easier to watch because the plot flows better. The scenes end the begin in a much smoother fashion, probably an addition of Cuaron. The only criticism I have is the ending, there has yet to be a Harry Potter film where the ending leaves me completely satisfied. I can only hope that the next ""Potter"" film is as good as this one was."
1334,8,By far the best Harry Potter film yet.,"This is the best of the Harry Potter movies. The critically acclaimed director Alfonso Cuaron brings his own unique vision to J.K. Rowling's wonderful story. He adds nice touches like the showing the Whomping Willow snagging passing birds. This movie can stand apart from the books and other movies as a good movie in its own right. It has poignant moments between Harry and his friends and with Professor Lupin, scary moments, and of course lots of adventure. The only complaint that I have that the movie does not explain why Harry thought the Patronus that saved him was from his dad. The book explains that his dad's Patronus is in the form of a stag."
1335,9,The Best Harry Potter Movie so far,"The Harry Potter books are loved for their wealth of detail and twisting story lines. The Prisoner of Azkaban is in my opinion where JKR changes gear after the first two and gives us a great book. I fully accept that transferring to film is a tricky balance to achieve, however in my view there was more than enough to pull out of the book to make for a great movie - and they failed. I suspect that parts of the film had to be made less scary or cut in order to get a PG certificate, however I would dearly love for the darker tale to be told. What on earth is the graveyard scene in the Goblet of Fire going to be like if this is the precedent? It seems the series is heading towards a backlash from the older readers over dumbing down for the younger kids. I say leave the twists and have the kids use their brains - and I think and hope that JKR is with me on that one. I'm quite happy to answer any of the questions the young ones might have."
1336,8,Keeping the kids entertained and telling a good story does not combine well,"I love the Potter yarn so I of course I liked this film. However, the gutting of the book for this one seems much more apparent than it did in the previous two. At times I felt as if I was on a roller-coaster, rushing through the story, hard cut to hard cut. Having read the book I could fill-in easily but for those who did not, following the story could be a challenge. Important second tier characters such as Snape, Black, Hagrid and many others got very light treatment which left me wanting more. I hope that IV and V are done in a 4 hour format to be released on separate dates, say Thanksgiving and Christmas of the same year. If these much longer books are compressed into 2 or even 3 hour films, I feel they will be rendered unrecognizable. As far as I can tell these films make a lot of money so a double release (double profit)makes sense."
1337,,Lots of gaps from the source material makes this film difficult to follow,"Harry Potter grows. We see the start of teenage angst. Harry begins to understand what his mother and father were like. He discovers his godfather and himself in the process. A slightly grimmer Harry than we've seen in the previous two films, location shots change as does Dumbledore with Michael Gambon giving a harder edge to the character(respect to the late Richard Harris)."
1338,,"Brief nitpick, however loved the rest.","The third movie is darker than the past two, but it is better. Director Alfonso Cuarón shows his talents in this film, but I can't say that I honestly mean that he is the most suited director for a movie like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. My feel is that some of the books elements come out wrong, even though this is the best Harry Potter so far. Of course some of this can probably be blamed on scriptwriter Steve Kloves. Some parts of the film seems a bit long, but that's a bit like the book actually."
1339,10,"Darker, but better","Having heard some good things about this third installment, and having enjoyed the first two films i was quite looking forward to seeing Harry Potter 3. The first obvious thing about this film is how much it has changed due to having a different director. Even though the book is darker the film is completely different. For a start, i don't think their is a brightly lit shot in almost the entire film!"
1340,9,Better than the other 2 and the book.,The third installment to the Harry Potter series just got better. With a new director on the helm (among other things) the movie and its cast has grown out of its shell and into maturity.
1341,10,A refreshing new take on the series.,"The main problem with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the fact that it glossed over too many important things in the book. Also Lupin and Harry's relationship developed far too quickly and they NEVER mentioned who Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. To me the movie felt like a poor summarization or book report of a great book. That being said the acting was good, the characterization was pretty good and the mood of the film was much more ominous. And seeing Hermione punch Malfoy was a real treat. If you're not a fan of the books the movie seems great. If you are you'll probably leave the theater thinking about what the movie could have been had it been longer or left in someone else's hands."
1342,7,Great atmosphere but too little back story.,"Of the first five Harry Potter novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite. It was as if J.K. Rowling had spent the first two stories on a steep professional learning curve, gradually improving her prose while she was finding her feet stylistically. Only in the third book was she so able to focus on the story, weaving an ingenious plot which builds to an immensely satisfying conclusion. I was pleased to learn that a new director had been found to tackle the Prisoner of Azkaban, and the results are, in the main, wonderful. The music and visuals are great, with Hogwarts looking better than in the first two films. There is often so much background detail in each shot, that you will have little chance of taking it all in until the film reaches DVD. The Dementors are scary (though the full horror of their soul-leeching kiss is not really dwelt upon) and the animagus / werewolf effects are effective too. Each of the three lead players has enough to do to develop their character a little more. The assurance of Emma Watson's level-headed Hermione is such that having her, and only her, squealing in every scary scene is a bit difficult to understand. The time traveling plot mechanism is well handled, and unlikely to confuse even younger viewers. This makes it odd that the film makes no effort to state clearly who the characters Wormtail, Moony, Padfoot, and (most importantly) Prongs are discovered to be. The obvious clues are all there, and readers already knew, but at what moment did Harry, Ron and Hermione share this realisation? Overall, this film is well worth going to see. Enjoy!"
1343,8,Best Director for Best Installment,"(first of all, apologies for my bad English. It's not my mother language)"
1344,10,"Love it, love it, love it!","For a while I still had not come around to the idea that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was as good as some critics have said. I think I was even left a little cold by this third entry in the series when I first saw it. I still really liked the film, considering it with ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" as the one of the strongest in the franchise so far. I never quite agreed that Chris Columbus's two Harry Potter films, which I loved were as weak as some critics believe but last night I found myself really coming around to the idea that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" may be the best entry in the franchise; and even if it isn't it still a terrific movie. The director of this film is Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron, director of ""Y tu mama tambien,"" which I have yet to see, and also the excellent ""Children of Men."" Even though I loved the first two Columbus films I think Cuaron is probably the best director to direct a film in the franchise. He has a keener visual sense than Columbus, meaning that Cuaron is able to make a CGI sequence like the train sequence when the Dementors first appear into a sequence that owes just as much to the way it is shot and lit as it is to the CGI artistry present. He even makes CGI-less scenes and shots very interesting. The whole movie is visually alive in a way that the first two, as great as they were, were not."
1345,9,Maybe the best Harry Potter film yet.,"I think that this movie was very well done. The characters were very well chosen, and it captured all of the fans' imagination! Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint were the best people for the roles. I think that Emma Watson is a great role model for all teenagers...especially me! Overall, it's one of the best movies, and I cannot wait for the rest of the movies! The movie was very well done and the cast worked the roles great. One of my favorite parts was when Hermione smacked Draco. Wow! What power! I think that they could have included more detail from the book. I am a huge Harry Potter fanatic!! I have read all the books more than once, and they I can never put them down! J.K. Rowling is an amazing author, and she captures everyone's imagination. All of my friends say that Harry Potter is the best movie ever! I agree with that...to sum up everything, I LOVED Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, and Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe are amazing! :)"
1346,10,One of the most action filled movies!,"ah, the third installment of the harry potter saga. it's probably the prettiest and atmospherically the most magical of all harry potter movies, however! oh, there's a big ""however"", and the only way I can describe it aptly is - well, it's stuttering! "
1347,8,"visually enchanting, but flawed","Overall, the latest installment in the Harry Potter series is a bit of a disappointment, primarily due to the many changes. Not only the unavoidable replacement of the late Richard Harris with Michael Gambon, but the alterations in architecture, landscaping and costuming. It just seemed more like a retelling than a continuation of the first two movies, with the familiar Hogwarts we had got to know from the first two movies replaced with a new vision. More darkness, not as much wonder."
1348,6,Where's the Continuity? Possible spoilers.,"Saw it in a preview yesterday. I'm no HP fan, but I've accompanied my daughter (now 10) to all three movies. Hoped this one would have some (chaste) ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" teenage exuberance, but it's not much different than the other movies. This one is better--and probably scarier--but not much better. It's slow-paced until near the end, and, if you haven't the read the book, somewhat incomprehensible. Most fun is spotting familiar English actors--Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Julie Christie, Dawn French, Timothy Spall. Daughter complained that important elements of the book were omitted. Tried to explain that as Rowling's books keep getting longer and movies needed to stay more or less the same length, something had to go. She remains unpersuaded."
1349,6,Won't disappoint true believers,Okay yes it was better then the first two. But if you a huge Harry Potter book fan like I am then you were probably left very disappointed.
1350,,Good.,"I am a mature viewer who loved everything about the first two movies but,I was disappointed with this third movie. I felt that it failed to expand on the story lines and on character's actions. Some parts of it made me feel as if i was only watching a ""trailer"" or a ""tease"". The plot and story telling in my estimation is more important to me than, the special effects. I felt short changed, because there was so little of the movie dealing with the interactions among the great characters in the book. The teachers were monotonous with their talk only of the ""prisoner going to come and get Harry"" and the interesting school and it's other students were almost completely ignored. My vote is a ""boo"" to this director for not holding my attention. His special effects were good, but the movie lacked a smooth story line and more character interactions in the daily school life."
1351,,"i was not pleased, it was too cut up and perhaps over-edited",I was sad that there was so little of the classic Hogwarts theme. 
1352,6,"short and sweet, don't read this if you haven't seen the film and don't want it spoiled.","Having never read the books i went into this film with no idea what to expect as i knew nothing that was going to happen. I was more than pleased with what i saw, the new director is a step up from Chris Columbus who did a very good job with the last two. The acting was of a good standard...i enjoyed Gary Oldman as Black, having never read the books i thought the character was very good and well played. Michael Gambon did a great job taking over for the now deceased Richard Harris. The special effects were of a high standard and while impressive never over powered the film and took more of a back seat to the characters and story. I liked this one also because of the darker tone and the whole style of the film made it very enjoyable."
1353,7,A New Angle - Possible Spoilers,"The film itself was good at it's own judgment. I wouldn't recommend it to those who want to see an adaptation of the books, but to see a interpretation of what J.K. Rowling, the actors, and the producers view it as. Before seeing this, I would honestly say to anyone who hasn't read the book to at least pick it up and get the important facts out of it and understand them. This movie does not explain why some things came about and many would get lost if you haven't never read the book. Still, don't read every page of the book. Doing so will lead you to be confused in the theater saying, 'That never happened,' and you won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as you'd like to."
1354,,"Plot bad, overall movie good!","I saw this movie at the midnight premiere in my town. I am well read in the Harry Potter series (almost obsessively so), and I have seen the previous two film adaptations of the books. In all objectivity, this film left a great deal of things out that were important in the book (such as the makers of the Marauders Map, how Black knew you-know-who was you-know-where, how Black escaped from Azkaban). In all objectivity acting was done really well - Emma Watson, whom I was previously slightly disappointed with, turned in a particularly beautiful performance. Cinematography was undoubtedly stronger than in the first two movies, it had much more depth. As for all the add-ins peculiar to the movie, there were things I did like and things I didn't like. I did like the addition of the ghosts, and the dorm room scenes, which helped to show the excitement and joy of Hogwarts life. I did not, however, like the Jar Jar Binx-esque co-navigator shrunken head on the Knights bus. The screenplay was really well written, but a lot of the main plot was either very rushed or left out, and a lot of more emotional points were put in (""You can always find [the ones you love who've left you] - in here [indicates heart]""). "
1355,,"Alfonso Cuarón's Interpretation of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""",The books growing thicker it's more and more difficult to fit in all the essential stuff in 2 and a half hour (max). I would've liked to see more about how Sirius escaped and about James Potters's friends back in the school days. Some scenes were added/changed but nothing crucial.
1356,8,"Nice conversion, although really missed some parts of the story.","I saw the movie yesterday and I gotta tell ya', it's one hell of a movie."
1357,,Get real guys!,***Caution: Spoilers if you haven't seen it yet***
1358,10,Best movie...but lacking,"I have been waiting for this film for a very long time, ever since I read the 3rd book and, after seeing the previews, I knew it would be something special. I believe the films are improving each time so I now have high expectations for the next one. One reason for this improvement would be that the leading cast members (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) now seem to be much more comfortable in their roles and achieve much more convincing performances this time around. I also think that Alfonso Cuarón has created a much darker atmosphere in this film than that of the first two and I am just sad that he will not be returning for the ""Goblet of Fire"". Gary Oldman, who I already considered a great actor, provides a very enjoyable performance as Sirius Black despite the small amount of screen time he is given. The Dementors were portrayed brilliantly and their animation was superb. The only disappointment I had was that the film had quite a few differences to the book. Anyone who has not read the books would not have found major holes in the plot but I, having read the book quite recently, noticed quite a few details missing from the film and parts of the plot that i think would have worked well on screen. Also, some things are never properly explained, such as how Sirius actually escaped from Azkaban in the first place."
1359,,A definite improvement on the previous films and worth the wait!,"In this third installment of the Harry Potter franchise, the action is much more fast-paced, the characters more developed (for the good or the bad) and the cinematography much, much darker. "
1360,,worthy entertainment,"I thought the movie was great. It was so much funnier than the other two. The places they shot the scenes in were beautiful, and the acting was brilliant. In the scene where harry tells hermione about sirius black betraying his parents made me cry almost. Also, the outfits made them look so much better. It made sense, because it proved that they are normal teenagers. teenagers wouldn't walk around in there robes in there free time. The ending was my favorite part. When they went back in time it was great. Also, i really liked the whole stone thing. It wasn't in the book, but it was a great add in. The only thing i didn't like was that I think they could have added a little more to the end. Overall, a great movie, see it, it's worth every penny."
1361,10,A great movie (spoilers),"Well, I have waited forever to see this movie come out to theaters since the Fall of 2002. After I saw the movie I was pretty disappointed by how much stuff was mixed around and how much stuff was cut out. But the fluid kept pumping and the story kept rolling."
1362,10,Terrifyingly great,"First let me start-out by saying that I have not read any of the books, so what I say here is only from the movie perspective. I have found all three of these movies very entertaining although I feel this last one was more of a breakaway from the first two. I suppose this is why I like it better. Nothing against the first two though. I guess I just like that Harry is starting to realize his destiny lies on a different path than most others."
1363,8,Interesting Movies,I just got home from seeing this movie. All I can say is WOW!
1364,9,WOW!,"Compared to the previous two movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has improved drastically. Although many avid Harry Potter fans (one being myself) are a bit disappointed with the many changes, I think that those specific changes can be overlooked with how well this movie has been directed, written, and acted."
1365,10,A definite improvement,"After a few days of thinking about PoA, after reading other comments and the message boards about what others thought...I have a much happier spin on the movie version of this wonderful story. I read an interview with Cuaron, I believe it was in Rolling Stone, and I was so super-excited about seeing the movie (which was wonderful)!"
1366,9,An interesting ride,"I have read the Harry Potter books many times and consider myself an avid fan. The first two films were good; they at least followed the spirit of the books. This film has very little to do with the book, the characters, location and story have been completely ignored. I feel, we the fans, have been totally betrayed. I left the cinema one hour ago and still feel angry. If you like the books and the first two films DO NOT go to see this film. Hope and pray that for the next one they go back to the old formula and get a director who cares about the books. Send a list of all the things that are wrong with this film to: Warner Bros. [us]"
1367,3,If you love the books...,CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN
1368,,Sat on the Fence,"I am not a fan of the books. I have never read one of them. I am not mad at the changes or misses from it. Still a bad director is a bad director. Alfonso Cuaron proves to be another me too 'audiences are dumb' blockbuster director wannabe. One thing I admire from Columbus is how he can pick and direct children to be believable. Alfonso just makes kids overact and/or underact. One cannot forget at any point that Harry and friends are acting in a set. Never you can believe they are having fun, scared or sad or anything. "
1369,,Bad directing,"Before assessing the good point of the movie, I start with the most obvious problem: it's length. If you've read the book, you'll know that it is a complex story with rich details and background and puzzles, so a 141 minutes is too short. "
1370,,"the best movie of the HP series so far, 8/10","Hail to Alfonso Cuarón! This film was easily the most exciting, not because of the story but because of the direction - The special effects were finally a bit ""special"" the previous films didn't even have smoking potions and every spell in the dual did the same thing.... $5 in dry ice would have gone a long way... I hope Alfonso Cuarón sticks with the series, he has vision and I think actually cared about the story in a way Chris Columbus didn't."
1371,,Best one yet - Hail to Alfonso Cuarón - appropriately dark & a fresh new feel,well... the movie... i didn't like it.... i thought it was the worst one yet... i got mad because most of the book is missing in the movie! they don't explain who padfoot is or the map at all! the whole scene in the whopping willow is all chopped off.... and there is just so much more that was gone... to me the movie was based on the spark note version of harry potter
1372,,not happy....,"It's amazing and beautiful. The Time subject is the main concern on the movie and that is pleasant. Big plans of the clocks working, the way they have to change their path going back, shown in a decent way. The difference between reality and perception, how harry gets to do things believing in something that it's not the truth, but it's what makes him deal with his problems. Of course it's not perfect, i think the Shapeless monster scene, where harry tries make his spell it's not really credible in some parts. And the one where Hermione grabs him while bouncing on the tree. Nhaaac, not really the best way to show it. But still these scenes are smashed by the beautiful concept of the castle and the greatness it inspires. Buckbeak it's amazing too. Never blinked to think it was CGI or how it was made, but still i was finding the story much lovely to worry about that."
1373,9,Time and Perception,"My review of HPPOA, the IMAX experience. The beginning was really good. Very funny, yet serious, faithful to the book. When they got to hogwarts, thats when the problem starts. First of all, what happened to the robes? Why weren't WIZARDS wearing robes? When did wizards began wearing MUGGLE clothes? HUH??? Did i miss a HP book or something? Where? Sorry, can't find it!! They did wear robes ONLY to classes, and they all looked like muggle going on a field trip when 3rd year/older students go to hogsmead. Whats so special? It looked like a scene from an American TV show!! (don't get me wrong, i love TV, well only dramas. Reality TV watchers, you need to get a REALITY CHECK!!) Second of all, I think HP movies are not suppose to be funny, some comedy is good, but definitely there shouldn't be too much. I have a question. Why did Lupin have to play some jazzy music when they practiced on the boggart???? I mean i can see its funny already, the music just made it so regular and non-magical. Plus, I gaged my way through the middle/end part (especially the part where hermione holds Ron's hand when she was frightened by buckbeak and the other more gaggy, part where she puts her head on rons shoulder after thinking she saw buckfeat was executed.) It was like, gag, go get a room, and where in the book did that happen???? 3rd of all, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were suppose to be SKINNY, BONEY!! Why, they were the bulkest/fatest people in the entire movie! And the worst part was this: the patronous was a stag the first time he sees it and the second time, he goes back in time to do it, where was the stag? the scenes didn't cordinate! I mean the tone of this movie is like one big joke..hahhaa..the director seems like he haven't read the book or something. I don't hate this movie, but its definitely not the best HP movie. Despite of what you would say or whatever, Dan isn't ugly, Rupert was OK (for once), Emma was beautiful, and Tom (Draco) was hot (for once). p.s. The only extremely kool thing about this movie was the IMAX screen and atmosphere. Very kool, it didn't seem as big as the IMAX at Navy Pier, but it was close enough. I hope that the next HP movie w/ also premiere @ IMAX and the new director can bring back some of the HP magic."
1374,,"Not good, but i don't hate it either.",Watching this movie was a an experience much alike reading the books... It contained some of the same magic emotion...
1375,10,Finally it did it...,"Being a loyal Potter fan myself I was very disappointed with POA. The flow of the movie was not very good. It jumped from event to event and didn't explain things very well. I can accept some changes from the book but this is not at all what I expected. Aside from the script the acting was very good!! Daniel, Rupert, Emma, Gary and others shined through the script to salvage what was left of my favorite story. Daniel rose to the challenge of portraying Harry in a darker sense.The special effects were very good, especially the Dementors. They at least held up to expectation. Those who have not read the books most likely will enjoy the movie, however readers will be disappointed."
1376,,POA is a disappointment to loyal Potter fans.,"I have seen all the movies and read all of the books at this point. I have no problem with the movie being dark, but I feel that they did the book a huge injustice. Not only did they leave out some crucial scenes, but there was no continuity and the movie was choppy. I did enjoy the FX and the dementors were very good. The movie itself was , in my opinion, too short. Also, I believe the characters have done an excellent job as they are growing up. David Thewlis did an exceptional performance as Prof. Lupin, but I did have a problem with a bald-headed werewolf. The best I can give this movie in all honesty is a ""C"" and that was because of Thewlis. I hope they can do a better job with GOF."
1377,5,Not up to par,"This film is without a doubt the best of the three ... It is so visually rich with detail ... Interesting angles, lots of exterior shots, special effects were seamless ... The acting of the three majors is improved, raw and natural ... While staying true to the essence of the book, what is delivered here is a pleasing, fast-paced, extremely witty, visual feast ..."
1378,10,Visual Feast,"I have been a Harry Potter fan since the books came out in the USA in 1999. To me, the books will always be a wonderful escape from reality. Prisoner of Azkaban just happens to be my favorite of the series. "
1379,10,Do not expect a replica of the book,"As a big fan of the books, I found this movie to be quite awful. I understand that the director has to cut parts of the book to make this into a condensed film, and I've made my peace with that. However, this movie seemed rushed and too many important details were left out. Not only that, scenes were added that weren't in the book which didn't add to the movie in any way. I tried to watch this as an unbiased observer, pretending I had never read the book, and that made it worse. If I were a neutral observer, I would say that the characters are not developed enough, and the story was too rushed and sparse of details to give any real clarity as to what was going on. I just got done watching the first two movies, and while the cut scenes annoyed me, I ultimately decided that it was okay. I do not feel this way about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and I can't believe anybody who hasn't read the books enjoyed this. As much as I cherish the books, I don't feel like this story is easily translated into film, and I think it shows."
1380,2,Terrible Adaptation,"This film makes one terrible mistake right out of the gate. It assumes you've read the book. The first two hours of the movie are several vignettes which are moments in the book, but you do not understand WHY they are happening, nor are they tied to together at all. Emma Thompson is wasted as Professor Trelawney...I assume most of her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. David Thewlis did a credible job as Professor Lupin, but there needed to be more star power in this important role. Alan Rickman also underused in this movie as Professor Snape...his role is larger in the book. I also hated Michael Gambon as Dumbeldore if for no other reason than Dumbledore needs to be a more imposing figure (ie, tall). The late Richard Harris was imposing, but also kindly. Gambon just comes off as befuddled. The kids did a great job overall...although it is startling how much many of them have changed as they become teenagers (they need to hurry and make the next two films before they become full-fledged adults). Also curious was that Malfoy's henchman Crabbe shows up in early in the film, but is replaced by another unnamed thug later in the movie. The last half hour of the movie is excellent...precisely when Gary Oldman enters the film and Alfonso Cuarón decided he better start actually telling the story at hand. Cuaron was so hell bent on putting his mark on this film that he did an awful job in the storytelling. People will see this movie regardless of what any critic says, I just doubt they will go see it again."
1381,,You're paying for the last 30 minutes.,"Although I've posted bits of this in a thread, I thought I'd like to leave a comment. "
1382,10,Just keeps getting better...,"This is a movie worth seeing again. I read the book more than 3 times. So I went with the eye of how the book was adapted to a screenplay. The basic storyline was there. But the way it was presented really branched off from the book. Which I found very interesting, but also exciting. I think any true Harry Potter fan would have sat thru a 3 hour Movie, so the movie director could have showed some of the details that were left out like how he really received the Firebolt or how Snape was really involved in the end book. Daniel, Emma and Rupert were superb in this movie. Emma Thompson role as Professor Trelawney was exactly has I pictured from reading the book. Gary Oldman portrayal of Sirius Black was I think worthy of a Oscar nomination. I can't wait to see what how The Goblet of Fire turns out."
1383,8,A movie worth seeing again,"Alfonso Cuaron has done it!! He has actually been able to improve the Harry Potter films. I will not give exact details, see the film please. The cinematography is brilliant. It is one of the most beautifully filmed movie i have ever seen. I teach these novels in my classes and Cuaron has nailed the third book perfectly. He has kept all of the best parts. The actors were all wonderful. Kudos to the three main actors for maintaining a new sense of maturity that grows within the books. I cannot wait for the fourth film, unfortunately, Cuaron is not directing it!! What a total shame. Radcliffe is great in the film as is Gary Oldman, his Sirius Black is worth waiting for in the second half of the film. David Thewlis was very good. Michael Gambon an inspired choice for Dumbledore. He is very good too. You will not believe how much everyone has grown as far as the children go either. Harry is a summer must see for all ages!"
1384,,"A Wonderful, Exciting New Addition to the Series!","Darker, tenser, scarier... the Harry Potter film has left its childhood behind. And it's fantastic."
1385,,The saviour of the Harry Potter films,"This is my first time posting a review, so bare with me. I also have a 1,000 word limit, and that hurts me to because of how much there is to talk about in regards to this movie."
1386,,Like Harry Potter? You'll Like The Film!,"It is remarkable just how much better this was than the first two films. The cinematography was better, the screenplay was better. Even the acting, though still not wonderful, was better. I have to say, I was supremely apprehensive about seeing this, being as it is my favorite book of the series. I was terrified for those bits of story that always somehow seemed to be left out. To tell the truth, there were plenty of bits left behind, but the rest of the movie was so joyous to an extreme Harry Potter fan such as myself that those bits didn't seem to matter. Anyone still defending Chris Columbus and his tendency to gloss the story over will hang their heads in shame at first sight of this film. Long live Alfonso Cuaron! If only he were coming back for a second turn. Long live midnight viewings as well, while I'm at it. ;D"
1387,,PoA as I saw it,"I must say that this film was BRILLIANT!! It's true, like people say, that it's as much for children as the other HP movies were, but that's because the books start to get more advanced also!! One must remember, that the movies cannot always live up to the books! But this movie was simply splendid! Alfonso Cuaron was the PERFECT director for this movie! He made it seem more realistic(if Hogwarts and such existed, that's more like how it would've been and how people would act nowadays!)!! And Stuart Craig deserves the ""Art Director of the Year"" award at the Hollywood Film Festival's 8th annual awards 100%!!!! I couldn't have asked for the movie to be ANY better than it was! Anyone that thinks this movie was not good enough(or entertaining enough) has either not read the books or is simply not open minded enough!! It is a funny, interesting, and wonderful movie that everyone should go see!! (unless you're an old grumpy person that doesn't like movies!!)! SO GO SEE IT! If you're a loyal Harry Potter fan, you'll love it that much more!! :D :D"
1388,,My plain opinion,"This is a good movie...but I really was hoping for it to be AMAZING...I think that Cuaron takes a bit too much liberties, especially in the way he has changed Hogwarts, and he cuts some parts that would have slowed the pace down a bit but that are really important...(Harry's patronus shape...who wrote the map...how Sirius knew that Pettigrew was at Hogwarts...Ron & Hermione that don't talk to each other for a while...). Anyway, has I say the movie is good, sometimes extremely good other times less; the kids are growing well in their roles, the choice for Dumbledor is adequate (even if he will always be Richard Harris in my mind), and the new professors also are well choose (especially Lupin)...so let's wait for the fourth one!!!!!!W HP!!!!!!"
1389,7,"Good, but hoping for better","Just an aside - Too old to play Harry? - give me a break! In a world in which Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta play high school seniors (Grease), some people find a 14 year old playing a 13 year old too hard to swallow? Hogwash!"
1390,10,Deviations from book add to story,"Not impressed :( The film seemed very rushed and somewhat hollow and could really have benefited from an extra half-hour or so, whether this is the fault of the studio or the director I would not like to speculate. There was very little character development, you never really find out much about Prof Lupin and his connections to Harrys parents. Many important descriptive details remained absent (e.g. just who are Mssrs Prongs, Moonie, Padfoot and Wormtail?)meaning that if you haven't read the books you could well remain in the dark about whats going on. On the plus side, the special effects where good, but these days a movie can not rely on effects alone."
1391,,Rushed and hollow,"OK , I just got back from POA and I am quite p***ed off , the last time I had the same feelings was when I watched LOTR for the first time (my feelings have changed majorly for it though-in a positive way of course) I know that adapting books means changing stuff and not mentioning sub-plots which aren't that important but what we have here is a film which isn't explaining it's main plot, what is that all about? I swear , if I hadn't read the books I would have probably left the cinema clueless of what I have just saw , just like my friends which I went with who liked the first two films but hadn't read the books... Why Sirius is innocent or who the hell is Peter? was the major questions rising in many heads and will have to be answered by Mike Newell in the fourth film , poor Mike!!"
1392,5,"Too fast, no details... (possible spoilers)","First off all I like the movie but i think it could be much better. Alfonso Cuarón Orozco should at least read the book 20 times. Just to get in the mood of the Harry potter world. Then he had to see at the previous movies, so that he knew how that it looked like, you just can't change the castle and the grounds, you got to work with the seem things."
1393,,"Great book, bat movie",the film was not bad but i expected more excitement comparing the book. for instance the part that they were in the tree .when i was reading this part i got so excited that i couldn't put down the book.but in the film this part didn't satisfy me . another part which didn't satisfy me was the part that harry encountered the dementor for the first time. but it had some interesting parts when they were in the defense against the dark art class and they were practicing their lesson for instance when Snape's cloths changed into a ridiculous one. i think as many people has read harry potter series the director would better make a film that attracts the viewer so much that he/she finds new interesting parts in it i don't mean to add new parts to the whole story.i mean something that seems new and exciting.
1394,6,it didn't excite me as much as the book,"Personally for me the third movie was definitely the best out of the three. I think it also helped that the third book was my favorite. It also helped me understand the movie a lot more although if you haven't read the 3rd book then i suggest you do after or before you see it, because it helps you to appreciate the story more. "
1395,,Almost Brilliant,"When I went into the theatre, I knew just as Cuaron did, that every page of the book would appear on screen, but I think he did a great job of capturing the essence of the book. I mean it is ultimately about Harry and his journey of accepting his fame and trying to understand the events in his past while trying to deal with adolescence. This film is really fast paced, and I completely understand why some fans will hate it, but it gave me the same feeling I got from reading the book. Whenever I sit to read the books it seems like the pages go so fast, and Rowling always leaves me wanting more, and I think Cuaron really captures that feel. No film can ever really be as good as the book....there is just so much characterization that must be left out, but I think this is the best attempt so far for the three feature films. Visually it was so spectacular! Buckbeak and Hogsmeade looked exactly as I pictured them and the cast was great, even though Micheal Gambon can never compare to the perfection of Richard Harris, I just wish I could get to see more mischief from the twins, because they are the comic relief in the book and they kind of lighten up the mood a bit. Nevertheless, it's a must see on my list and I can't wait to see it again!"
1396,10,"Of course its not the book, but...",I've been eagerly awaiting this film and was not disappointed. I caught a midnight show and not once did I start to fall asleep. 
1397,10,The wait is over!,"I found that the movie was great! Alfonso CuarÃ³n seems like a great director, especially after hearing so many great things about him from interviews with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Very different compared to the first two movies, but still very good. I honestly prefer Richard Harris as professor Dumbledore over Michael Gambon. It's a shame he passed away, because I'm sure he'll be missed greatly. However, the rest of the cast was amazing such as Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson and David Thewlis. I'm unsure why, but Professor Lupin was, without a doubt, my favourite character in the movie. I really felt for him and Sirius Black. Overall, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone and ensure you'll love it. ^_^"
1398,10,"Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant!",This has got to be the best of the three films! It was incredible!
1399,10,Absolutely WICKED!,"Well first off the directing in this movie was brilliant! I really liked the way that he did his own thing but kind of kept some things that Chris Columbus would've done. The movie was okay but it didn't do any justice to the book because they cut out scenes that were needed. What happens if people who haven't read the book in there? Nothing is really explained. I think that I loved the movie only because I was waiting for it for such a long time so just seeing made me love it. The acting in it was fantastic though. Even Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all did brilliant jobs. They all matured really and I think they just knew their characters the third time around. Overall on a scale to 1-10 I'd give it a 6."
1400,,Fantastic Directing...not so fantastic movie,"Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban is by far the best film in the Harry Potter series yet.Intriguing from the start to finish.Deeper and darker then the past two films Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.I am very satisfied with the new director Alfonso Cuaron.He handles the legacy of growing up very well,since this is the third installment of J.K.Rowling's fantastic series in which Harry Potter reaches his teenager years at age thirteen.(Possible Spoiler Warning) Harry's abilities are put to the test when he learns of a very dark wizard's secret...that involves him.He needs to know when to follow his gut instincts.Dealing with average teen problems is only half of what he has to cope with.Suffering still on his grief of his parent's death he reaches the boiling point."
1401,,Gets Better And Better:Best Yet,"I must admit. When the first teaser trailers came out in theaters I couldn't care less. I had seen the first and second potter films, but only rented them and watched them once. I didn't really care until one day I say who was the director. Legendary Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. Because of this, I read and now own all the books and movies in the series. I knew this film would be better because of the fact that this book totally beat the first to books. But once I saw the film, I was amazed. This film is better not only because of the detail and stunning visuals. But because of the way the filmmakers took the essential essence of the books and made a film with new and interesting sub-plot points. All in all 10/10."
1402,10,best potter movie yet.,"I thought the movie was bad..especially the end. What the hell is Harry doing? Riding a broom, looking so happy. Childish really. I think the director rush it too much. I thought there is gonna be Pigwidgeon. Where is he anyway?? I think Alfonso did an OK job.. not an excellent one. The movie is all mess up. Most people that hasn't read the book will wonder like how did Prof. Lupin know how to open the Marauders Map, or, Who is Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs? Oh well, the movie has been made and I don't like it. I think the first two is better even though it is the introduction and has not have much things in it. The third one is suppose to be the ""WOW"" one."
1403,1,Really Bad...,"This movie was great, the new director did a really good job. They changed Hogwarts a little bit, like adding a giant clock, a long bridge, and moving Hagrid's cabin, but it doesn't change a thing. I actually thought this movie captured the book better than the first two, especially the part when Hermione turns back her watch."
1404,,Buyable Good,"OK this may contain spoilers, you've been warned! So I've just got back from seeing this, and I liked it."
1405,8,"Its Different, but its Good","Was it just me or did Hogwarts change completely.!! Don't you think the students would of realized it.!!!Duh!!!! I read the book more than ten times and its my favourite of the Harry Potter installment. But it just disappointed me. I thought the only thing funny about it was Ron Weasley, who was actually a good actor. Despite the few puns here and there, I am disappointed in the screenplay writer and am more upset with the way it ended. Just flash, bang oh oh.... wow credits... But I suppose I couldn't find fault with the set. It was going to be different anyway. They don't know the image I had in my head. It did bug me abit though because Hogwarts was different. Different to the books. Smaller. It's not that way in the books. I just hope Steve can write a better script for the next one. It shouldn't be that hard. He has the f**king books."
1406,,Bit confusing!!!,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was great installment from the book to the movie!! It was funnier and it showed more on Ron and Hermione's relationship!! I know that they are missing some parts from the book but look at it if they put every part into the movie the movie might have been over 4 hours long or even longer!!! i think that its a great movie and Alfonso did a spectacular job directing it!!! I can't wait to see Goblet of Fire next year!!! I hope Mike Newell does a great job on the next installment!! I do hope everyone comes back for the 4th installment!! They are a great cast and they do spectacular job portraying the roles!! One of the funniest scenes in Prisoner of Azkaban was when the aunt was blowing up and her buttons were popping off and hitting Dudley in the face!! The other part was when Harry was on the Knight Bus and the driver stopped quick because the old lady was crossing the road and Harry went flying into the window and his face was sticking to the window!!! there are even more funnier parts but if i write all of them i will be here for hours!! Well anyways Go see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban because its by far the best installment of the Harry Potter books to Movies!!!
1407,10,That was such an incredible movie!,"Where to begin? Let's start with the fact that this director has NO knowledge of Harry Potter, either the previous movies or the books. Some background knowledge would have gone a long way. I realize the issue and pressure put on by the time constraints of a movie; no one wants to sit through a five hour film. HOWEVER - why leave out all of the important threads that tie this story together and instead include elaborate scenes that do not pertain to the storyline nor enhance anything or did not happen at all? To J.K. Rowling I give my deepest sympathy that her ""baby"" has been massacred (I'm seeing a parallel between Voldemort killing Harry's parents and Cuaron destroying this book). As many others have said there is no continuity between the previous two movies and this one. Landscape changes, a random massive clock, the giant (or maybe he's changed to miniature for this film) squid's puddle of a lake and the small, insignificant dementors that are supposed to frighten all but instead look like wisps of cloth that a slight breeze would blow them to the moon. I feel pity for the actors, who in the previous movies portrayed happy-go-lucky youngsters who through courage and wits were able to come out victorious. In this movie it looks as if they all need some happy pills- where is the emotion? The acting seems forced - and if it were me I would be a little depressed too if the films that were my life suddenly took a turn towards a very large cliff. "
1408,,Absolutely horrified - spoiler within,"The film was good - I paid £5 to get in and I think it was worth every penny, if indeed not just to sit in the comfortable seats for all of two and a half hours."
1409,,Interesting - well worth the money,Anybody expecting another kids film will be surprised. Everything has grown up. Hogwarts is no longer a fantasy castle but actually seems real. The 'kids' are young adults and the focus on 'childish' activities to appeal to a young audience has been replaced by something darker and more threatening.
1410,9,Surprised,"Not bad. Less childish. Though I have to admit I was waiting for more suspense in the movie. As an avid Harry Potter fan I was not disappointed with the movie per se but perhaps it could have been a little longer. That would have allowed those who are unfamiliar with the books to be less confused. I've spent almost all day explaining parts to friends who have never read harry potter. That was too bad because in some ways it seemed the more important dialogues were discarded for more trivial ones. For example, why wasn't Black's situation explained better? Instead we had a part where Hermione and Draco are arguing near Hagrid's cottage. I would have rather seen the former as possibly would have others. Then again, its not easy to capture the intricacy of such long and complex storytelling in a movie. It makes one wonder what they would do with part 4? I hope they spend less time on special effects and more on the story. Though of course, the special effects were great!"
1411,8,better than the others,This film was the best so far.
1412,,Very Dark!!,"I saw this film yesterday. I think it is the best one yet. The new director has done an excellent job. This is an interesting movie because Harry, Hermione, and Ron all begin to grow up in this film and the actors are growing with them. This movie stays very true to the book even though some of the more detailed parts had to be left out due to obvious time constraints. I really liked the Marauder's map and the special effects they were absolutely incredible. Buckbeak, the hippogriff, looked pretty computer animated to me but he even seemed pretty real. I think more than anything it was just amazing to see this book come to life. When Harry casts the Expecto Patromum it is really sweet how you get to see him save himself. Lupin is an important character to this film as well. It is pretty interesting how they show him transform from a man to a werewolf. Anyways, long story short this is a great movie, I think it gives the first two a run for their money. I highly recommend it."
1413,,Harry Potter grows up,"Overall this was a good movie, it was much better than the other two. Alfonso Cuaron did an excellent job. The movie included a lot more humor and the actors have greatly improved their performances. It's quite a bit more realistic and convincing. Compliments to the young actors and actresses."
1414,8,In very few aspects was it poorly-done... Overall it was wonderful!,"I really enjoyed the film, but i had to constantly keep in mind that i could read the book again if i wanted a better version. As humans we all have faults - the director and screen writer are human in the fact that they did not follow this book. Why is so important to follow it? Because it is bloody good! All of the suspense and emotion was taken out (for the most part) I would think that viewers who have not read the books would be confused at times. Curon says that the left out parts will be incorporated into another movie - but with what time? Books 4 and 5 are both longer than book 3 - so how the heck could they fit those missing parts into one of the other books? Plus there was a lot of wasted time on artsy poses and things that were not in the book- so why add it if they wanted to make it short and sweet?"
1415,10,Loved it but they missed major parts,"Definitely one not to be missed,although the film is missing lots of the original story and can be confusing to young people or people who haven't read the book - like my dad. The film is well made and is darker than the previous two films,but there is also a lot of humour in it.Be prepared not to see all of what is in the book! The acting is very good but is a different style to the other two films and takes a while to get used to.Some parts of the story can be a bit slow but the main part of the story is very well made and the special effects are brilliant. the story always has you on the edge of your seat and some scenes may be frightening for younger children -definatly worth seeing."
1416,9,enjoyable for all ages,"OK SO let's get straight into it yeah? harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was AMAZING! it was so good it just blew me away! from the opening scene to the end credits all was one incredible action packed adventure! definitely take the kids and the grown ups to see this one! daniel radcliffe and rupert grint and also emma watson have greatly improved in their acting skills. they no longer seem to be reading lines from a script they are living the whole story. another incredible acting performance was done by David thewlis, the man who was chosen to play professor R.J.Lupin. in my opinion it was the best casting ever for a harry potter character not to mention really good acting too. compared to the first and second movies this third one by alfonso cuaron is definitely worthy of praise. the director was a great choice too, not that chris columbus was bad, but alfonso really did keep to the spirit of the books. it also had a more adult feel to it unlike the last two and he really knows how to make a movie darkeningly exciting, does alfonso cuaron. it wasn't so scary, more thrilling and it was perfect. gary oldman was excellent as sirius black the escaped murderer after harry and daniel radcliffe really played the emotional scenes very well. the best ones were with David thewlis. also the new dumbledore, michael gambon, really slipped into richard harris's shoes. if anyone could live up to him then gambon could and did. there weren't many scenes with gambon but it was a good introduction of him into the movie. so in conclusion: watch this movie, it's the best of the three. and if this is number three then i can't wait for number four. bring it on i say! and alfonso by the way kudos!"
1417,,was this movie good? I THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!,"Chris Columbus was roundly castigated for his ""slavish"" adherence to the J.K. Rowling books when he directed the first two films. Ironically, Alfonso Curon's very different approach has yielded a film that gives a better sense of the spirit of the books. "
1418,9,Best Potter yet.Comes closest to the feeling of the books.,"Alfonso Cuaron has made a film worthy of the title ""Harry Potter."" Allow me to say: it's about time! After Columbus' slow and obtuse movies, Cuaron's creativity and movement seems like a work of genius. "
1419,7,"Creative, Charming, and Clever","OMG!!!! I was having trouble deciding which of the first two movies I liked best but when I saw PoA, I was like, ""This is the best movie EVER!"" ( I saw it on Sunday) I loved the Gothicy thing the movie had going. It was definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. I'm going to go see it again on Saturday this weekend! After I saw the movie on Sunday, my hand was itching for the remote to press play and watch it again....it was that good! I've never had it happen with my hand before. My husband loved the movie too. He said that it's also his favourite out of the three. We are definitely going to buy the DVD as soon as the movie comes out."
1420,10,PoA,"Ah yes, we are back at Hogwarts for a third year. To be completely honest with you, I own all the books and the DVD'S. I love the story of Harry Potter. It is truly storytelling at it's best. At any rate, this installment of the HP movie franchise is quite surprisingly the best of all three. I was shocked to hear Prisoner Of Azkaban was going into production sans Chris Columbus at the helm. His successor Alfonso Cuaron (Tu Mama Tambien-or something like that) brought a whole new dimension to the story. It was much darker than Sorcerers Stone, and Chamber Of Secrets. He allowed the young Brits to show that yes, they are aging and going through puberty. Ahem, Rupert Grint going through his Peter Brady phase? I especially enjoyed Gary Oldmans jumpy performance as Sirius. As to be expected, solid performances from Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. SPOILER: The scene where Harry is trying to track Sirius through the footsteps of Peter Pettigrew through the halls at night only to be caught by Snape was excellent. The tension between Harry and Snape was so wonderfully displayed. While the script did sway a little from the story, i.e the touchy feely stuff between Hermione and Ron, I didn't mind it though. Overall the screenplay was truthful to J.K Rowlings story. By the way, how much is she worth now? I digress. This movie is worth seeing, if not just to see Emma Watson who is growing into quite the cutie!!"
1421,,Third times a charm.,"The third Harry Potter book is one of the best of the series. Many had hoped to believe that the movie would match the same criteria. But it has failed to show, in my opinion."
1422,,Not much to say...,"Well.. I went to see the movie yesterday. Being someone who has read and re-read the books several times (although I don't claim to be an obsessive), I have to say I left the cinema rather disappointed. It's not that I thought the movie itself as a whole was so bad.. but for this budget I didn't feel it made the grade. The quality of the shooting felt to me almost like a low budget British movie from the 1970's, where as the darkened tone of colours may have been effective in parts, it was overkill using it through the entire movie. Personally I LIKED the more colourful fantasy world feel Chris Columbus gave. "
1423,4,What spoiled it for me......,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie with great special effects. Though they could have gone into better depth of his parents like they do in the book, but I'm sure they had a reason for timing for that. But otherwise, the actors and actresses were all wonderful as their characters. They did not over-act any parts and they did not under-act. I also think that they did a great job explaining everything, making it so if you didn't read or see the first two Harry Potters, then you could still understand the movie. The only bad thing I still think was the depth of the parents. So overall it was a great movie with great effects and great actors and actresses. I cannot wait for the next movie to come out!!"
1424,9,Harry's third year at Hogwarts. He meets Sirius Black and finds him to be innocent.,"I have mixed feelings towards this new Harry Potter installment; while it is decidedly better then the first two it felt very rushed. Previosly Columbus would strive to include vital plot details and explore the many subplots that make the books interesting. In this version however the movie feels rushed. I read the book when it came out and do not remember every small detail but is was extremely obvious to me that the director was paying lipservice to many of the subplots by casually mentioning them. The main plot itself was not well explained was not well explained. The relationships between the characters was not explored, and there was very little development. The film just seemed to be a cliff-notes of the book; mention the important details, get a few wrong, and make sure it is done with in a couple of hours As usual the ensemble of British character actors was wonderful and the children seem to be getting better. One major compliant i had with the first two films is that the camera would somewhat stop and focus on a little piece of handiwork that the special effects team put together. This self appreciating habit has all but disappeared in this film except for several laughable gags with a extremely violent tree."
1425,,The Cliff-Notes Version of the Book on Film,"I understand that as the books get longer there is more and more that needs to be condensed into the typical two and a half hour movie, but when such crucial characters and story lines that are pivotal for future movies are left out, i have to wonder if there even planning on finishing The Goblet of Fire. Daniel, Emma, and Rupert did yet again an amazing job, but after hearing there E! interviews, and how excited for this movie, i'm left guessing if they ever read the books. ARGH!, they left out Cedric Diggory, they didn't explain why Harry Patronum is a stag, they barely explained Hermione's schedule conflicts, and David Thewlis is a wonderful Prof. Lupin, but they cut his role in half!"
1426,,What the heck happened???,"I am shocked to see that this movie is not getting rave reviews from everyone! I am at a loss to see where anyone could criticize it; I assume they must be fans of the movies only and not the books. Yes, this movie is ""darker"" than the previous two. Readers of the books will know that each book leads Harry one step closer to the eventual (long-awaited) ultimate showdown with Voldemort, so each book is a little darker, and a little more suspenseful and thus each movie will be a little darker and more suspenseful."
1427,10,Perfect for the Whole Family!,"The movie is so boring that i started dozing off towards the end. The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best novel in the series, and the movie did no justice to the book. I understand that it's difficult to adapt an entire book into a 2 Hr movie. But they should have at least included the crucial chapters which they never did. "
1428,,Dumbest of the 3,"How dare someone give this movie a good review without having read the book! In short, seeing this movie is like reading the cliff notes on the book. I can't believe that JKR allowed this screenwriter to butcher her work in this manner! The film is disjointed, merely randomly hitting the ""high points"" of the book without paying any attention to the subtle details that tie into Harry's past. This screenwriter completely ignored all the wonderfully rich details concerning the Marauders' Map. This movie is so lacking that it never even ties the stag to Harry's father. In fact, the significance of the stag is never even mentioned. The film, in comparison to the two previous ones, is a sad sad SAD disappointment. The reason that the first two were successful is that they respected the readers and fans of the Harry Potter series enough to show the complete story. (with the exception of the dead-day party in book two). This movie is an insult. It was written apparently in a short form to ""hold the attention"" of viewers. Alas, the idiotic screenwriter forgot the important fact that the people paying to see the movie actually read the books -- and expect them to be done in a manner that pays homage to the genius of JKR. If you go to this movie expecting the excellence of the first two, don't bother. No matter how this failure is presented with ""excellent"" cinematography, and beautiful ""changing of the seasons,"" it is still nothing more than a glorious failure. I wish JKR more success in the future with the choice of screenwriters. (And how could Draco Malfoy be given such a teeny tiny part? Give me a break!)"
1429,,Do not bother seeing this if you are a fan of the book!,"I just loved the movie, and i'm going to check him out a second time in the movies !It think it is just great that you see the actors like daniël and emma and rupert evolve like they evolve in the story. I am now reading the fourth story of harry potter 'the goblet of fire'. I think it's a movie that anyone must see, it doesn't mather whether you are old or something, just go and watch the movie ! Or buy, borrow it on DVD when he comes out in the videostore (I'm sure as hell going to buy it). But aren't there rumors going that daniël is going to leave the movie after the fourth is recorded ? they are saying he is becoming to old ? Well, I think it's just rubbish that they are going to replace him, without him, harry isn't really harry, if you know what i'm saying."
1430,10,Just perfect !,"I was highly anticipating this film ever since ""Sorcerer's Stone"", but really feel that I have been let down. I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan, and I feel that Alfonso Cuaron has left out much of the detail found in the books and the first two movies. This movie felt as if you could never follow the story unless you have already read the books. And this movie doesn't seem to fall into place with the rest of the in-progress series."
1431,6,Pretty disappointing and hard to follow,"I'd like to start off this review by stating that I have read and love the Harry Potter books. I would also like to state that the first two movies were very good. Now...Prisoner of Azkaban sucked. It was the worst movie out of the series. It was choppy, didn't stay close to the book at all, invented things that never happened, didn't include a lot of important details and put things out of order. It sucked! That's all I can say about it, really. If a person who hasn't read the books goes to see this movie, they won't get it at all. My mom was so confused throughout the whole movie. I had to continually lean over and explain things to her. If you haven't read the books, don't see this movie. If you have read the books, see the movie so you can complain later. It was a piece of crap (and that's putting it nicely). I am ticked that JK Rowling would even approve this crap! Argh!"
1432,,A Piece of Crap!,I saw this movie yesterday at a screening in Chicago. I thought there was more humor in this film than the other two. The characters are older and this makes them better actors. There are some new additions to the cast and they add a lot to the film. Harry's uncle is meaner then ever.The new director did a good job of being true to the book. The action focuses less on life at Hogwarts this time. I wish there was more Quidditch. The special effects were good. The end gets a little confusing because there is a lot of time travel. The movie is not too scary and it is probably appropriate for all school age children. I think people of all ages will enjoy this movie. I will probably see it again.
1433,8,Funniest so far,"There is something about this movie that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Something about it didn't satisfy me. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series whether we're talking about the books or the movies and I think this movie was great besides the fact something was missing. The first two movies were good too but not as good. I think the only better thing in the first two is that they were longer. The sets were brilliant, if only they had used them in the first two. Hagrids hut was excellent (not so sure about the pumpkins though) with it now set next to the lake that was featured in the book. The whomping willow too was good and was much more different to the one in the second movie."
1434,,Something Missing!,"Exquisite storytelling with a twist, that gives the Potter series a much more interesting direction than the first or second film did. People, things, places and time are not what they seem in this installment of the Potter franchise and make it this film enjoyable not only for fans of Harry Potter, but basically for everyone looking for a captivating story, great images and the right amount of special effects to enhance the story. Bravo!"
1435,,Exquisite storytelling with a twist,"After having seen a screening of the movie in Hollywood last night I regret to say that I do not understand the enthusiasm I've seen written in other reviews. I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series, I have read all of the books,and the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of my favorites. Nevertheless, I regret to say that it would appear from this film that Mr Cuaron is a muggle. The change of direction was evident throughout. The entire 'feel' of the Harry Potter universe was changed, the 'magic' so skillfully created by Ms Rowling and captured by Mr Columbus was all but gone. The actors themselves seemed ill at ease at times and there was 'staged' feel in many of the scenes. I also cannot see how anyone unfamiliar with the book would have a chance of following the disjointed and highly diluted plot. Nevertheless, there were some high points. There were many humorous and well acted scenes, and the cast is a collection of some of the finest actors around today. Despite its failings, I would recommend anyone even a little bit interested in Harry Potter to see it."
1436,,Overall quite disappointing,"A little dark, almost too scary with the shrunken head guiding the bus driver on the Knight Bus in the beginning to the dementors guarding Hogwarts, not to mention the skulking werewolf in the shadows. It's quite far into the movie before we see Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), I would have liked it if his character had a larger part. Hopefully in the next movie we will see Harry living with his ""Godfather"" instead of that awful Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. And how many of us would love to do to someone what Harry was able to do to ""Aunt Marge""??? I am very happy and lucky to have been able to see this movie as a treat. It was actually my niece (my Goddaughter) who won the tickets and took me!!! I know it should have been the other way around, but way to go Kendall! (BTW good luck with the Constitution Test today, I love you, call me if you need me) And thank you! I can only hope Goblet of Fire is as good. I believe I will need to start reading the books before seeing the movies. I really wanted to be Hermione when she socked Draco one! Want to go see this movie again but I guess I will have to wait until it comes to the theaters, I KNOW I will be buying this one when it is released for home sales and keep my collection growing. My friend Denise bought me the first one and I thank you, too Denise! The introduction of new Professors and new creatures in this movie really re-directs some interest. Shame, shame on anyone who would behead a lovely little Buckbeak. I hadn't read the book and was hoping that somehow, maybe with the use of the time tuner we would find that Harry's parents (James and Lily) aren't really dead after all, maybe just hidden in one of the paintings (maybe behind a cow with the fat lady) or trapped in a mirror. This is a very exciting and wonderful movie, EVERYONE must see it! AND ENJOY!!!"
1437,,The absolute best Harry Potter yet!,"This was an amazing movie. The actors have gotten much better, although Hermione isn't what she's supposed to be. They lost her character. It's a shame they did not stick to the book more, putting Oliver Wood and Cho Chang in. However, there's another movie... but Oliver Wood will not be returning unless J.K. Rowling puts it in her book. It was a good movie - I saw it cuz my friend won sneak passes to the movie-- it's really good and much better. the new characters were much better and i think that in the next few movies, if the books are good, then the cast/plot/lightening/scenery/tech/sound fx will be much better and we will be very pleased. GO HARRY POTTER!! YOU GUYS ROCK FOR LIFE!!"
1438,,Pretty good,"Fairly enjoyable way of spending 2 hours if you enjoyed the first two films. However, this film deviates the most from the book it represents so if you are desperately expecting a re enactment of the book stay at home ! The acting is up to the usual standard, with the principles still believable as 13 year olds (a feat in itself) and the supporting cast are fine, though probably less on screen than the first two.. A time filler that probably wastes Gary Oldman and spends too much time on ""arty"" direction..a new director for number 4 is a relief, though Chris Columbus would have been fine. Despite these reservations an enjoyable film that will keep the harry potter dynasty alive and looking to number 4 next year.."
1439,8,"Enjoyable, though not entirely true to the book","I had just read the book when i saw the movie, and to be honest, i was really disappointed by the film. Not only are they not following the book (harry receives his new nimbus2000 at the end of the movie, while in the book it is much more earlier). Besides, they are jumping around in the movie, without a good explanation of the story. (it was not told who did make the map with the secret rooms ). Last but not least, in almost all the movie, the characters are wearing normal clothing If the next movie will continue like that, it will destroy the secret of harry potter itself. I have read the book almost every day till late at night, but i had to fight myself not to fall asleep during the movie"
1440,2,harry potter 3,"Harry Potter 3 was not what I expected. Not even a tad better. The change in directors is probably the reason for this. Sure, its darker, with the softer lighting and the quick flash close ups whenever the moment for facial emotion changes to fear - even though many was uncalled for as it was too over dramatized in some areas. The movie gave the viewers nothing and I say this. If you had not read the book, you will truly never understand the movie. Columbus, though leaving out some partial essentials, was a good director, putting what he could into his movies while this new director has taken a new turn and has focused entirely on practically all the new characters and places. You hardly get a glimpse of a teacher, a proper class - the school in general is minimized completely and unlike when watching the Columbus movies, you feel that a year actually hasn't passed in Hogwarts. I really did want to fall asleep in this movie, but felt if I did, I'd have to watch it again to see the rest and I did not want to do that. You don't feel comfortable in the movie, there's no explanations set out, and its too quick. The camera passes over so many sub conversations, like when Malfoy broke his arm and is exaggerating its real pain in the dining hall, the camera passed over quickly hitting straight on the famous three, that you never truly received the humour of Malfoy. And personally I think that Dumbledore did a terrible job. He was no longer the gentle wizard who Harry warmed to - he was just another face that saved Harry from dropping. And Lupin, I did not seem to get anything from either, and it was definitely most sad as how the movie took away the explanations of the Maurauder's Map, Harry's Patronus, Padfoot, Prongs, Moony and Wormtail, etc etc, which was essential to tell. The only real part I enjoyed was from when they went to Hagrid's hut before Buckbeak's murder. That was when Cuaron's darker filming techniques were needed, to which he used to his advantage brilliantly. I do not think Cuaron was the best choice as he did not know how to add depth to the characters and let them grow for the audience to love. Many mistakes were made in this movie and I think him as the directing choice was only a small part of it."
1441,,A lot went wrong,"I saw the prisoner of azkaban no less than a few hours ago and I must say I was was very impressed. Before viewing I had it clearly cemented in my mind that there will never be a movie to justify the greatness of the Harry Potter books. I simply went to see this movie as a Harry Potter fan and not to compare it (which in my opinion is the best book along with the goblet of fire). Having sat through the movie with this frame of mind I was well and truly entertained throughout! My frame of mind excusing the small details which were left out and the very ropey performance of the new Dumbledore (quirky old man, very unsure of himself). Instead I found that the whole cinematography of the film was far superior to Columbous's efforts, as was the general day to day aspect of Hogwarts. Everything felt much more 'real' and the misty, fantasy style camera work was superb."
1442,,Impressive,"An excellent interpretation of the book (the best one). The performances of the three leads were vastly improved and David Thewlis' turn as Lupin is a highlight. However, the real hero is Alfonso Cuaron who has created a mesmerizing movie which fully encapsulates the darkness of the Prisoner of Azkaban and is wonderfully shot!! The cinematography was spot on as Hogwarts and the surrounding countryside has never looked so beautiful. The Dementors are just as imagined and the cinema was full of fear everytime they appeared. All in all an excellent movie in its own right and one which will get multiple viewings."
1443,10,Dementingly Good!!!,"I thought this movie was a pretty good adaption of the book. It had even better graphics than the first two and you could see a more artistic taste to the directing. I thought that in some situations the movie didn't get descriptive enough and through off people who hadn't read the book. Things like not explaining who prongs, padfoot, wormtail and moony confused why they randomly were mentioned. Also when Harry received the Firebolt was a horrible timing and did not flow at all, it made more sense when he was giving it during the quidditch season. I think the movie should've also showed more quidditch scenes because they won the cup this year and there was quite a few chapters on it. I did enjoy the shrieking shack scene, it was very great portray from the book and it was cool to see it on film. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD so I can buy it. I also can't wait until the fourth movie comes out."
1444,8,Opinion about the movie,"Well, what can i say? Harry Potter had definitely changed thats for sure. The movie has a much darker, more Gothic feel to it. The sunny, pleasant Hogwarts now seems to have turned into a dark, dingy, possibly evil castle, like the one you find in horror movies (not that thats a good thing) - and the clock is waaay freaky - especially that pendulum! I'm sure that violates some health and safety laws. The new Direction is clear - the scene transitions are excellent, the changing of seasons and camera movements work really well, the CGI is good, and i feel the acting has improved. This however is where i feel the good points stop."
1445,,!! SPOILERS !! HP Turned Gothic?,"This film marks what I hope to be a turning point in the books adaptation to film, although I should say that I find the first two books somewhat duller than the rest of the series so far."
1446,10,My review,This version is very dark and the filming and directing certainly differs greatly from the previous films. I however find this just and evolutionary.
1447,10,Simply irresistible!,Spoiler
1448,,"A review, saw it last night.","Okay, I saw PoA, and I was wowed by the film. Cuaron did a great job of taking the movie in the darker and more focused direction of the book. Thewlis and Oldman were great as Lupin and Sirius. The camera in this movie actually gives the idea that Hogwarts is a huge boarding school. The camera moves along finding the characters, not being static as the actors move in a scene. Columbus was faithful to the novels, and for that he can be commended, but he never took any risks. That is where credit goes to Cuaron, who made the world of Harry Potter his own. That being said, there are some flaws. Michael Gambon is very good as Dumbledore, but he just can't live up to what Richard Harris did with the role. I would've been much happier to see Ian McKellen, or even (dare I say, it would be devilishly entertaining)Sean Connery. There are some discrepancies in the plot, but those can be overlooked. One major flaw sticks out to me, however. These books are fantasy tales: stories of witches and wizards and magic. Cuaron sort of forgets that this is fairy tale and focuses soley on the realistic characteristics of the movie. Given, he is very talented at this, but it seems to me his talent is mismatched with the material. He is given fantasy, and he tries to make it realistic. That is the only real problem, that the world of this movie isn't fantastical enough to be truly as engrossing as the first two."
1449,,"Great film, but sub-par adaptation","The overall movie was just okay when viewing it by itself. Having to be the third movie of the series, it lacked fluidity with the first two movies. It was a disappointment. "
1450,,A Bitter Disappointment,"In one word, the first two installments of the HP series sucked. In two words, they EXTREMELY sucked. And that's not an understatement. I lost faith in the movies being as great as the books."
1451,1,Past Pitiful Performance Repeated,"Liked it ! It's delightful, almost beautiful... "
1452,9,Great movie but could've even better. (Contains SPOILERS),"The best Harry Potter movie yet?! Arguably, no. I would say that this film is on par with the last two - all entertaining and magical films."
1453,8,Very good but feeling rushed,"We went to see the third in the series of Harry Potter films last night, and were hugely disappointed. Why oh why has the director changed? The effect on the film is immeasurable, and completely ruins a very successful precedent set by the first two."
1454,,What a disappointment (Spoiler),"OK ! I had the pleasure of watching this at the Odeon in Leicester Square on the 31st, part of the reason I enjoyed the film was down to the excellent atmosphere created by so many fans in one place, and the sheer scale of this old theatre."
1455,8,So So,"I saw this film last night and I was extremely disappointed. The film was extremely light on plot and was comic in parts where a more sober tone was called for. The child actors have improved a great deal since the first film but Malfoy has become a caricature and his hair is now a scarily un-natural shade of platinum, which really doesn't make him more believable. I felt really let-down watching this film - the pace was slow and I constantly had a feeling that something was missing."
1456,,Disappointment,"I must say, I had high expectations for the third installment, and having enjoyed the first 2 was hoping for something of better quality than was on offer. "
1457,,"OK, but a tad disappointing","As a massive Harry Potter fan I have to say that I was very disappointed with the third film. So much important detail has been left out in this film. It seems almost too humorous in places e.g. Harry and Hermoine have turned back time to save both the buckbeak and Sirius Blacks life and all Hermoine can say is ''does my hair really look like that from the back''? What happened in the shrieking shack? There was no explanation of Peter Pettigrew being the 'secret keeper' for the Potters and no mention of the fact that the four men were once great friends who developed the marauders map? This was supposed to be the part of the story where everything was explained e.g. how Sirius escaped from Azkaban and how Harry finally had someone who cared deeply for him after losing his parents, you know, the part in the book at which most of us struggled not to shed a tear or two.....I'm sorry but the film just didn't achieve this. Harry has gone from being a polite, almost timid boy at the Dursleys, to losing his temper at the first negative comment. The worst part for me was the ending. What happened to the Hogwarts Express, the letter Harry receives from Sirius, Ron being given his own owl and why didn't ron even mention that Harry was invited along with the Weasleys to watch the Quidditch world cup? Bring back the previous director and we might get the original scenery, uniforms and the magic back."
1458,,Disappointed.....,"I have not read any of the books and I have never watched the first two films from start to finish, but I saw ""...Azkaban"" at an advance screening under the worst conditions (theater too warm, lots of cell phones ringing, babies crying!)with three FANS, all of whom had read the book-and I enjoyed it! The story was more than adequate, the effects were extremely well done and I don't think it was too intense for younger viewers. The 6 year-old girl in our group (who has seen the 1st two films repeatedly) also enjoyed it. "
1459,,"Very Good, but fans of the book say not as good as SS & CofS","Went to see this with great anticipation, as a massive fan of all the books so far. Left feeling somewhat satisfied, somewhat bemused and slightly outraged - they have butchered some of the most crucial parts of the book."
1460,,"Good, great, OK, bit disappointed (spoiler)",I have just got back from the cinema and have to say that I enjoyed the movie. The effects were really good a lot better than the other 2.
1461,,Could you change any more,"It was as I suspected a great movie, the camera man's fading in and out was a little strange, but good over all. The movie was wonderful, and Micheal Gambon as I suspected wasn't great at all, he was OK at best. That is probably why they gave him so few lines which was best for every one. I can't wait too buy it when it comes out to DVD. I wonder how many more movies they will have, but I will but and see all them in theaters. I hope the others keep getting better each one is better than the one before. People are worried because Daniel and rest of the cast are growing older, Daniel is taller than me supposedly and I'm 20 years old. I think it won't matter if they grow even more because they are great actors and actresses. Go see the movie if you haven't already. And I didn't spoil anything."
1462,10,"Harry Potter 3, Great Movie","It's most definitely the best one in the series of film adaptations so far. The humor throughout the film, makes the 2 hour and 19 minute running time fly by. It helps that the young actors, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, are all developing into very fine actors. The whole cast is wonderful and Alfonso Cuaron should be proud. He did a magnificent directing job. The film takes the heart of the novel and portrays it well on-screen. Though, die-hard Potter fans may notice some major scenes missing from the film that were in the book, they will not be disappointed by the film. From beginning to end, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a funny, suspenseful, enjoyable ride!"
1463,9,The Best So Far...,"The movie was really bad. So much was taken out and changed that my mom and sister, who never read the books, kept asking constantly,-what happened? who's that? I basically didn't like it at all. So many people here who saw it came to school and were all talking about how bad it was. The only good thing I can say was how funny Rupert Grint(Ron Weasley)was,and of course Dan Radcliffe(Harry Potter). The effects were good such as the Hippogriff, Buckbeak, and the Dimentors(except for the fact that they were flying in the movie). The first two movies were a lot better. I really liked them, although they too could have had a little more of the book in them."
1464,2,bad,Where should I begin?
1465,,My favourite book turned movie...,"I was SO excited to watch the third HARRY POTTER film.. mainly because of the cast, the story, and everything else that comes with it.."
1466,,wicked!!!!!,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the darkest of the movies so far. Cuarôn has done a great job on the emotional part and the special effects, but the movie should have been twice as long. Unfortunately the storyline is quite different from the book as they have cut so much, that people who haven't read the books have difficulties to follow the plot - I don't think they can actually understand it."
1467,,very odd indeed..,"First of all, I apologize for my English, I'm a French girl so be kind.."
1468,4,Anything but That !,"Okay needless to say that the visuals are striking,the performances of the now wellknown cast are better then ever but...what about the story...or lack of it? It seems like the director has taken a few parts of the book,filmed them wonderfully but never thought about the people watching the movie without having read the book first.Is this ""the best of""? The whole Lupin,Black,Pettigrew,Snape situation in the end kept my friends guessing to what was going on,Crookshanks(my favourite)wasn't given the time of day,the struggle between Hermione and Ron that actually continues throughout the book because of the rat scabbers so called being eaten by Crookshanks is nowhere to be noticed. The ending changed so the hippogriff has a heroic thing going on by shaking off Lupin as a weerwolf.What about Harry's head showing in Hogsmeade and thus having problems with Snape... Yes I think this is a big problem and I do hope the DVD will remedy this. Greetz from Ghent,Belgium"
1469,,Where did the story go?,"In the book, Azkaban has been the best of the 5 series. So far it is too in screen. Alfonso Cuaron deserves the credit. The 3rd installment of the book as we know has been the longest compared to the 2 first and as we have also known they cut a lot of scenes to fit into the 150 mins screening. When still losing some touches, Azkaban has got the best cutting and replacing and modifying some scenes. I enjoy the superb visual effects especially when Harry riding on Buckbeak."
1470,8,Improvement From Prequels,"I have been an avid Harry Potter fan ever sense the Sorcerer's Stone. Books of course are always better because you jam more information and don't have to worry about time, I understand this. The first half of this film was jammed packed with so much information they should have just had a scrolling story like star wars does. The characters in the first half of the film was so dry I couldn't relate to the characters. The first two films left a lot out as well but it still felt it was following the story. Showing a cleaning witch for a funny scene in the movie or the womping willow killing a bird? What does that have to do with Harry Potter. Or the firebolt at the end of the film?! I felt thats a key part of the movie because it shows Harry in defeat. Which doesn't happen much in the films. I got to like oliver wood in the first two films and he just wasn't in this one?! Malfoy had no key part in the film they should have just not had him in the movie either. They talked so much about this director Alfonso Cuarón I think hes terrible. I saw Y tu mamá también I thought that movie was not good. Great expectations was a terrible adaption as well. He needs to stick with ""Y tu mamá también"" films. Thank God hes not directing the fourth film maybe Mike Newell will do better. Come back Chris!!!"
1471,4,This film was very poorly directed!! And I love Harry Potter!!!,"I just got back from the 12:01am opening of HP: PoA in NYC, Times Square (June 4th). Now 3:44am :)"
1472,10,Absolutely brilliant.,"In my opinion the strongest of the books, definitely the best film. If the first two suffered from too literal translations into film, Azkaban brings a magic of its own to the screen - dark colours, Christmas card snow scenes - less quidditch! Some of the changes and additions are improvements - incidentally it means that you can't be sure what will happen next, even if you've read the book. A pity that the director isn't doing Goblet of Fire too - now that will be a challenge"
1473,9,The best so far ..,"I was disappointed with this film. Caught up in the Potter excitement, I stayed up to watch the 12:01 am premier, only to find that the whole feeling of the movie was like the Knight's Bus. That is - the movie moved swiftly, allowing for brief passing glimpses of the story, all in order to get to the destination (the scene with Sirius, Pettigrew, Lupin, et. al). While I think the visuals were MUCH better than the previous two, I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the novels could even begin to comprehend the story. I understand that Cuarón felt he didn't need to explain things as it was in the first two movies, I felt no connection with Lupin or Sirius, and felt that the other well established characters were caricatures, not developing individuals. This is not to say that the acting was bad. I think everyone did a fine job, there was just too much emphasis on hitting certain plot points along the way to the climax. My husband described it as picking certain pages from the book and throwing them on the screen, with no previous or following pages to help you understand the significance. Perhaps fewer individual scenes would have been appropriate in order to develop the storyline."
1474,6,Film is the Knight Bus,"Personally, I was disappointed in the way the movie turned out. It was as if they cut the book apart and rearranged it. I mean if the movie were standing on it's own, it would have been OK...but there is a book with it and the movie didn't follow the book as closely as the other two movies did."
1475,,Something was missing...,"I must admit, I was pretty exited to see this film. I read the book at least twice, and wanted to see if the film makers could honour it. "
1476,,Harry Potter 3 Adaptation is a complete letdown,"For those who have read and love the book, they will understand everything in the movie (though will be mad about what is left out). For those of you who haven't read the book, you will probably be lost. There isn't a whole heck of a lot of explaining of events in the movie. My advice to non-readers: 1. Read the book!!! but if you don't have time 2. have someone give you a run down of the some of the details after you see it. Then, go read the book! All in all though, I loved it. The new director really took the series into a new direction and it was great. I liked the new sets and the new Dumbledore works out well and I have to say I like him better than Richard Harris. And, since when did the Weasley twins get HOT??"
1477,9,book lovers vs. non-readers,"I think this adaptation is the truest yet to the spirit of Rowlings' books, though they clearly streamlined quite a bit. Sure, I missed some of the details of the books, like finally winning the Quidditch cup, but I think that it was actually a better movie for not trying to cover every detail. That's what the books are for -- all the wonderful details. I was sorely disappointed in the first movie, OK with the second one, and pretty happy with this third one."
1478,10,Best of the movie adaptations so far! Minor spoilers in my quibbles.,"Much darker than two previous, I would keep small kids at home. The action is intense in spots and the dementors will probably scare lots of folks."
1479,9,Scarier with lots of details,I was thoroughly disappointed by watching this movie last night. The director simply stuck with the main storyline and never added in some of the minor sub-plots that made the book so great.
1480,,Ready for a fast paced ride?,"I thought this movie was fantastic. It truly became an entity of its own in its ability to not rely on all of the events of the book so much and still be magical enough to be Harry Potter and convey the message that Azkaban portrayed. The direction was wonderful (I loved the added elements such as shrunken heads and hump-backed bell-boys), and I find that the imperfections of the before perfect setting of Hogwarts and the grounds around it a very nice addition to this movie. I feel that this movie was made more magical with the rocky hills and rickety overpasses. The teenage actors, as well as the older ones that have been in the other movies, did a much better job in this movie, I think that they now have the feel of their characters down. The new characters were casted wonderfully, and they also added to the magic of the movie. All in all, I simply loved it."
1481,10,Simply Grand,I am disappointed that it appears the humble but talented work of Chris Columbus in providing an accurate big screen rendition of J.K. Rawlings inspired writings has come to an abrupt end.
1482,7,Disappointing Diversion from Author's Storyline & Detail,"I really thought the movie went too fast. There was so much more they could have done to make the story better. I also believe that the movie was just a little too weird. Of course the movie was supposed to be dark, but I think the director took too many liberties. I know they kept too the book, but it just didn't feel right. Maybe I'm just looking too much into it, but I still could have asked for more. Oh, and where did all the Quiddich go? That was a great part of the book and it was nearly snubbed. The special effects were wonderful though. Buckbeak and the Dementors looked great. I just think the whole movie was missing something."
1483,,Weird and Fast,"This was a great book and had potential to be a great movie, unfortunately it was disappointing. Being the shortest of the 3 films I felt pushed through the movie, instead of a full year at Hogwarts it seemed more like a week. Only it didn't seem like Hogwarts at all, it was like a whole new school that I was lost in. Unlike the first two movies which were wonderfully done, I felt that this movie was not true to the book. Too much new (and unnecessary) stuff was added in and too much of the book was left out and twisted around. So much of it was wrong or missing I wouldn't know where to start. I would like to see the previous Director return for the Goblet of Fire. I felt that he had actually read and enjoyed/respected the series~ and it showed in his films."
1484,,Disappointing and not true enough to the book.,"Amongst all the Harry Potter films, I think that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is my favourite because there's a lot of doubt hanging over the entire story. At the beginning, we don't know who Sirius Black really is. First, he is depicted as a very dangerous man and as time goes by, we realize that he is endearing. The same applies to Professor Lupin. I already liked the previous movies of the saga but I found this one even better! Besides, the film set is quite amazing, the special effects are incredible and I particularly enjoyed the idea of ""the Marauder's Map"". For all these reasons, I warmly recommend this film!"
1485,10,A great movie,"When I go to a movie that is over two hours long and find myself looking at my watch one hour in because I am bored, I know the movie is bad."
1486,,"Sorry guys, I just don't' see it",If I had not read the book before hand I would most certainly not have this lingering feeling that the movie is missing something.
1487,7,Good Film - Bad Book Conversion,Well I did love the movie but they did make some pretty drastic changes in the transition from book to movie. Most them involved the sequence events that revolved around Harry.
1488,,A lot of changes,"Alfonso Cuaron did exactly what I feared he would do to the Harry Pottery story. He created a dark, dreary world with mediocre special effects, a choppy story, and art-house cinematography that almost ruined the movie for me. Harry Potter is not about gratuitous and grainy close-ups of the actors saying their lines. It's not about rearranging the story to fit an artistic vision. It's a children's film franchise that, in the hands of Cuaron, came dangerously close to becoming a big budget mess. "
1489,,Too dark. Too dreary. Too choppy. Too artsyfartsy.,I had waited months for this movie to come out. I even took the day off with a couple of friends so that we may be able to see it at the first showing at the Cine Capri. We all re-read the book the week before just to make sure we were up-to-date on all the pertinent information.
1490,,Disappointed and Betrayed,"I saw this movie last night at midnight. so no matter what I say , go and see the movie for yourself, because I was very tired."
1491,,What I thought.........,"This film was very poorly done in my opinion. The beginning jumped right to the school and they totally skipped some very important things from the book. The filming was poor it almost looked like a cam corder in the beginning. And you almost wouldn't even know it was his aunt that came over unless you have read the books. The story was not well put together too much information was left out. The costumes were poorly made, and looked crappy. I was thoroughly disappointed with this film and I will not go see it again. The film went too quickly and they didn't spend enough time on important things in the film, like the fact that harrys dad was an animagus and all about their friends at school. I was upset about the outcome of the movie."
1492,,I was disappointed!!,Wow. I guess the third time really is the charm eh? 
1493,,"Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching","Anyone who is a true harry potter fan will find this movie to be very little like the book. The director obviously just used the name of Harry Potter and cut and pasted what he thought would sell. This director (what's his mane) is not a Potter fan and it would seem by his work he only read the 3rd book. Not to mention the grounds are totally different and shows a lack of consistency in the movies. By the way, this movie did not have to be as dark as everyone says, He purposely made it that way. The 3rd book is the best of the series, in my opinion, and the previous director Columbus should have done this one as well. You know it is sad that the best Harry Potter book, The Prisoner of Azkaban, which had the best story, mystery, suspense and twisting of plot, has to be the worst of ALL the Harry Potter movies!"
1494,,Terrible!!!,****Some Spoilers*******
1495,,"Stylish, but not by the book",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a disappointment to me as an Hp fan.
1496,,Disappointment,"Though the special effects and actors' performances in this film are quite good, this film seems to lack nearly all of the subtleties and nuances that made the book an enjoyable read. Granted, it would be impossible to capture all the wit and plot twists of the novel, but the writers and director seem to have sucked much of the fun and suspense out of the storyline. The result is a film that feels hurried, leaves several annoying loose-ends, and is peppered with humor that is stale rather than fun."
1497,,"Enjoyable, but lacking that certain...","Having read the book prior to seeing the movie, it was very good. However, having gone with others who had not read the book, a lot was left unexplained. I found myself explaining 1/2 the movie to them so they would understand. Otherwise, a true joy as always - My son and I look forward to the next one! There were spots that seemed slow and unconnected. But again, if you read the book those lapses disappeared. It was nice to the kids in ""street"" clothes , they seemed more real. It was also nice to see Hermonie show some true personality this time around. She is really coming out of her shell and showing her true colors. The humor in the movie was great too. It broke up the dark and sometimes depressing theme. I would love to know when the next book (book 6) will be out. I can't imagine how she could end with only 7 books. Hopefully she will see fit to continue on with this story."
1498,9,Comments on Movie,***MaJoR SpOiLeR***
1499,,Viewer's Review of the New Movie ***Major Spoiler***,No Spoilers.
1500,,As a MOVIE (NOT A BOOK ON SCREEN)...it was Awesome!,"I am an admitted Potter-phile....however, my boyfriend is not. He has not read the books, but enjoyed the first two movies. The third however, is another story. The first two movies took the extra couple of minutes to explain a new concept, so that when it would be referred to later in the movie, the audience would be able to fit the pieces of the puzzle together. In the Prisoner of Azkaban, however, much of the information was skipped over."
1501,,Don't see if you haven't read the books,"As an avid fan of the books, and of the first two films, I went to see ""Azkaban"" at the very first available showing in my area (as I did with the first two). I came away excited, and a little disappointed, too."
1502,,"Wonderful, despite some changes and omissions","I was very disappointed when i recently went to go see the hp3 movie. i Have read all the hp books and know my potter pretty well. The movie did not do the book justice. It came off as confusing to a lot of my friends that went to go see it, and i was left trying to fill everyone in. I was feeling nauseous while watching it just knowing everything they were leaving out. The whole origin of the map and that it was everybodys nicknames is one thing i thought to be the coolest part of the book, and they talked nothing of it. they did not Show much of crookshanks either, who was a big part in the book. My favorite teacher Hagrid was not shown nor was any other professor really given a chance to shine. The third book was my favhp book and to me they ruined it. I had a picture in my mind of how it was and they did not depict it right to me anyways. Don't get me wrong the movie had great effects, and you can see the actors maturing before your eyes, but the whole story was just jumbled up and made into a something that ""hollywood"" would like. it was as if they did not care about how to make a good movie based on the book, but rather how to make a ""cool"" movie and sell the most copies. i was VERY disappointed."
1503,,Don't go see it!,"The new director has made an excellent conversion, boiling down the filler and getting straight to the core action, moments, and message as intended by J.K.R. really raised the bar compared to the first two movies."
1504,10,New director gives a straight to the action view on the movie,"It is such a thrill to see a fine book become a fine film -- more so in this than even in the previous two films in this series. The kids are becoming quality screen performers, and the adult actors are uniformly of high quality. The look and feel of the film are very true to the book, and yet it is clearly very cinematic, not literary, in plotting and style. Our whole family, all fans of the books, enjoyed it immensely."
1505,10,"Great acting, true to the book in spirit and detail.","Well I just saw it tonight and wow did the director read the books? The movie wasn't too bad but I think little things would have made it much better. For instance when harry was caught in the hall by Snape, the reason Snape was up was because he had a potion to give to Lupin. Another little thing that bothers me is when did they start wearing normal cloths? What is wrong with the robes? And when did Hermione start wearing her hair up. One of her vices , so to speak, is her bushy hair. And what is up with Harry's Patronus Charm? Why did they leave out that it took the shape of a Buck and chased the dementors away? That was a big part of Harry's memory of his father. What happened to Hogwart's too? I guess the producer forgot to watch the first two movies and didn't realize Columbus already made it up. Instead he created his own school. What the heck? Also to me, the movie seemed to move to fast. I don't think it would have been a bad movie if they just fixed some little things. I hope Chris Columbus take a hand in the next movies to come and gets them back on track."
1506,,Little Things = Bad movie,"I could barely sit through this butchered version of one of the best books in the series. The first order of business to save the Potter franchise is fire both the director and screenwriter. Did either of these two read the 3rd book, and if so did they feel what Rowling was trying to convey? Parts completely omitted, others added not relevant to the story at all. Who wants to see a bird get smashed by the willow over 3 times? What a waste of money. The Firebolt at the end of the movie ? No explanation of the Mauraders map. I could go on, but what for, everyone who read the book already knows. I just found out the same people are doing Goblet of Fire. How do they expect me to trust their vision of a book twice the size of the third ? Look what they did to that one. I will go on record and say Goblet of Fire will be even worse. They'll probably cut out one challenge completely. Well fool me once shame on you....I'm keeping my money. I'll stick with the books."
1507,,Total crap...Fire the buffoons who made this tripe,"Please tell me this because they left a whole lot out. First of all, they didn't explain ANYTHING. They didn't explain that Lupin, Black, Potter, and Pettigrew were all best friends and classmates. They didn't explain that Sirius, James, and Peter became unregistered animagi to help Remus in his werewolf state. They didn't explain about the map. They didn't put in anything about Harry's parents which was all through the book as the dementors appeared. The fact that Harry spent a lot of time working on his Patronus was a big part of the book too. They left out the part about Harry seeing the Firebolt and getting it before he did in the movie....not to mention the fact that Hermione told Professor McGonagall and she took it away because she thought it may be cursed. That being only a few things that they left out. Needless to say I'm not pleased with this movie at all."
1508,,How are they supposed to lead into the next one?,"just seen HP3 while stopping over in kuching, borneo. Unfortunately it was a little cut - why? i know not!"
1509,,marvellous,"Let's begin with the change of scenery at Hogwarts. Where did that long corridor down to Hagrid's cabin come from? What happened to Hagrid's cabin being across the lawn? The whomping willow, entry to the forest, mountains and rocks, the list goes on and on. "
1510,,Harry Potter- No explanation? No suspense?,"I had been greatly anticipating this movie, not only because I love the Harry Potter books but also because I'm a great fan of Alfonso Cuarón. I must say that I was not at all disappointed."
1511,,"Good adaptation, great movie","My wife and I saw the new Harry Potter movie on its opening day, while most kids were still in school. I have fallen asleep each of the many times I have tried to watch the two previous movies in the series, much to my granddaughters' amusement. What with strep throat, penicillin, and a monstrously full work week, I fully expected to do so again."
1512,,If you want to be a kid again... see it.,With the couple of hundred reviews already said there is not much i can add.
1513,,If you going to make a book into a movie try to read it first,"Not only was this movie shorter (IT SEEMED LONGER) It is missing all the warmth hogwarts offered. Though the actors were fantastic, The sets were cold and humorless...Everything we know and love about HOGWARTS (AND Dumbledore) IS gone! In its place a gloomy version of its former self. DUMBLEDORE twittering around in tatty grey robes is almost as disturbing as the completely different layout of the school grounds.Where is the color, humor,and splendor of hogwarts!!??I don't understand how they can have meaningless scenes with shrunken heads but can't seem to find time for QUIDDITCH. Where is Ginny Weasley? WE SAW HER 1 TIME FOR 2 SECONDS,AND OLIVER WOOD!ONE OF OUR FAVORITES!Is completely cut from the film."
1514,,"DARK,WHERE'S THE HUMOR, THE DIRECTOR CHANGED TO MUCH!","I saw and liked it, but I did not love it. I love the books and I loved the first two movies because they were as true as can be to the books. Maybe I need to see it again, because I was so caught up with it being true to the book that I believed it stood in the way of my enjoying it."
1515,,I saw it...,This film style was a turn for the worse in Harry Potter. The film
1516,7,A completely disappointing film.,"What people need to understand about the Harry Potter movies is that, they're following suit with the books. As the books progress, they get darker and scarier. It's necessary to keep the mood that was in the books to stay as true to them as possible. Not only do Harry and his friends have to deal with scary wizarding situations, (Voldemort, Sirius Black, freaky creatures and dementors), but they're also entering the ever dreaded teen years. Years that when we adults look back at them, we don't want to go there ever again. Also, Harry is constantly dealing with the loss of parents he never knew. He thinks the prisoner of Azkaban is the one that killed them and he's a little mad. That is the reason this movie and the ones to follow aren't exactly light-hearted. I give the movie a 10."
1517,,It needs to be dark.,My feelings on this are mixed because I am a lover of the books and thus a nit-picker. I was disturbed by the changing of sequence and by the lack of details (especially the explanation of who wrote the map and why Harry called up a stag) but all in all I liked the movie quite a lot.
1518,,Mixed Feelings,"I'm glad that I'm not the only one who was disappointed by this film. I would love to know what the director was ""going for"". The story wasn't just muddled OMG that's an understatement. Any Harry Potter fan is sure to be very disappointed. There were very necessary bits of information left out of this film. What about the relationship with sirius and Harry's parents ?"
1519,8,Very disappointed -,"I have to confess that when my three young sons insisted on taking me to the latest Harry Potter incarnation, I thought it would be a good opportunity to catch up on a bit of sleep. Having read the two previous books and endured the subsequent films, an afternoon of shopping would have even sounded more appealing. So imagine my surprise when I left the theatre having thoroughly enjoyed this most recent episode. Now I don't care that it didn't follow the book exactly, this was a movie. It had a decent script, developed the characters so that I actually cared about them and moved along at a pace that didn't have me reaching for a pillow. Sure there are flaws, Daniel Radcliffe will not win an Oscar and Michael Gambon, though good, did not have the same presence or charm of Richard Harris. However, it is rattling good entertainment and when the time comes for me to shell out £15 on the DVD, I shall do so with a bit more grace."
1520,8,"At last, a Harry Potter movie","This one was the best of the three, but I did not like the fact that Sean Biggerstaff ""Oliver Wood"" was nowhere to be found in it. He's the best part of the movie, and this one was supposed to be the one with the Quidditch Cup - aka lots of Sean Biggerstaff, but no he wasn't in there at all!"
1521,,Good - but extreme lack of Sean Biggerstaff!,"I am, first and foremost, a Harry fan. I have read all five books (numerous times, I might add), and year three has proven my favorite of all the books. That being said, I loved this movie. Yes, there are many changes within the plot, some of which could be considered major. However, with each book, Rowling's storyline becomes increasingly more complex, not to mention the pages increase in number as well. Therefore, it seems reasonable that each movie will have to make sacrifices in order to make the best film possible. This latest installment in the series is still faithful to the characters and the spirit of the books, which makes any change to the plot justifiable."
1522,,Not in the least disappointing (possible spoilers),"I can't believe what a bad movie this was...I loved the other two, but PoA stunk. Hogwarts must have had major earthquakes to end up looking the way it did in this movie. The story line was so bad that if I hadn't read the book I would have never know what the heck was going on. Ron and Malfoy were way to wimpy. Harry was crying and acting like a girl half the time...I don't know too many 13 year old boys that act like that. The book and the movie have only a few things in common. I hope that for the 5th movie they ask back the director of the first two movies...If this director ever does another Harry Potter I will never watch another H.P. movie again."
1523,,Worst Movie Ever!,the acting was great the special effects superb but i cant imagine what the director was thinking it was like he took a 10 hour movie and completely destroyed it. this movie was cut up so bad that it really didn't make much sense and i really cant imagine why they would ruin such a great book by making such a horrible movie i have to suggest that the next time around they bring back chris columbus as director because this guy was a moron this was supposed to be a fantasy film but he ended up making some really cheesy action movie that would make segal cry again what were they thinking I'm surprised ms rowling didn't die from the horror of it a big waste of time if they wanted to make this book a movie it should have been at least an hour longer
1524,,what were they thinking,"This was another fine adaptation of the Harry Potter books, and one could tell that a different director was at the helm. I came away wanting more though, because the action / story made the time go by so quickly. I thought there were a number of things that were left out of the film that will be important in the later films (in terms of the story). For example, there was no mention of the fact that the names from the Marauder's Map (Mooney, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prong) were Harry's Father and his friends. That is important because they picked on Severus Snape as a classmate, which explains why Snape treats Harry the way he does."
1525,9,Another great film in the series!,"This has to be the worst book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen. Although movies don't necessary have to be slaves to the books they're based on in order to be good (The Shining is a classic example), this was simply AWFUL. Instead of cutting out fluff, they added more and decided to cut out some really intricate portions of the plot. One of the friends that I went to the movie with who hadn't read the book before had this glassy look in his eyes after it was over, then turned to us and said, ""What just happened? I'm so lost."" He wasn't alone. "
1526,,Awful,"I loved Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I thought it was by far the best out of all three so far. It was more faithful to the book, unlike the other two and much more ""mature"" is the best way to describe it. Harry and his friends are growing up, and it's getting much more serious than it was. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was clever, speedy, well-acted and truly, truly amazing! Well done Alfonso Cuáron! WELL DONE! I've noticed how much the acting has improved also - especially Emma Watson. She played an outstanding role. I'm looking forward to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the next director, who is new again, obviously has a big challenge to live up to. Let's see if it will be good! They've already begun filming and it's looking good. So, cross your fingers!"
1527,10,Fantastic!,"I have to say that the movies keep getting better. The first was a dog. This one was really great. The Hippogryph was unbelievable. I don't think i've ever seen a non-humanoid monster look so real. There were some shortcuts in the story line that, had i not read the book, might have left me a little bewildered. But i did, and i loved it! Very exciting! Hope the rest turn out this good.."
1528,10,The first HP movie that lived up to the books - really great,!!!!SPOILERS!!!!
1529,,Bad Thoughts,"I've been so excited to see this movie. I was so excited. From about 5 minutes into the movie until the credit roll, i had my mouth open, and a look of shock on my face. This movie could have been great, but instead, this director with a total lack of talent butchered one of the better Potter stories. Its understandable that pieces will have to be cut out, but this was just terribly done. It was like he didn't even read the story, he just wanted to show everyone that he knows how to use special effects and different camera angles. From the very start, important pieces of the plot of the story were missing, and in their place were shaky-shots (which were intended to be shaky, but looked terrible nonetheless) and attempted uses of dramatic effects. This movie had absolutely NO continuity with the last two movies whatsoever. It appeared that it wasn't even attempted. The movie lost a lot of its ""magical"" feel with the lack of proper costume, owing again, to the lack of continuity. So, the movie is here, we all waited for it with great excitement and anticipation, and it was a total disappointment. I guess the only good thing to look forward to in the next movie of the series is that they changed directors.. thank goodness. *PLEASE make the next movie(s) follow the path of the first two... please!!*"
1530,,The movie is a BIG disappointment...,"I may be overly critical seeing as for me and many others the 3rd book is the favorite of the so far 5 book series. It was well casted and the information was given in a good way, and let's be honest, the special effects were great. The 3rd book being my favorite, and having read it many times, I knew what was going on at every instant of the 2hr 21min film. There were times though, when I was a bit perplexed. There were many things put out of order (there is my overly-critical side kicking up again) and there were things that weren't in the book that could have been omitted to make room for several scenes that I think to be crucial. My examples and reasons are as follows:"
1531,,"3rd movie was good, not great","Grrr... I LOVE the artistic vision!!!!!! For the first time the wizarding world of JK Rowling appears truly bizarre and bohemian and wonderful and its all great!!!! I love Cuaron's choices and interpretations and felt that they were very appropriate given the wizarding world is supposed to be as far away from normal as possible. I am totally willing to be contented with his vision... But after two viewings of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban I'm left without also hearing the things I love, and need to hear. Rowling has a very gifted way of telling us her character's messages: messages that guide the reader in a very gentle and acceptable way. These messages were present in the first two movies, but it feels like they are ignored this time around. "
1532,,Left wanting more...,"I was a little disappointed in ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"". A lot of the story was either left out or changed. If you have read the book, you will see what I mean. If you haven't read the book, I think you will still feel like something is missing. It doesn't ""pull you in"" like the first two.The three main actors in the movie were very good, the computer graphics were were very good but the story was lacking. I don't think this new director understood the essence of Harry Potter. The film seemed ""rushed""and a few things that needed to be explained, weren't. I recommend the film but read the book as well if you haven't already. I hate to say this is one of those movies that the book was better."
1533,,A little disappointing,"I'm a great fan of the Potter series! Having said that ... I was disappointed in the Prisoner of Azkaban movie. Things were changed that added nothing significant to the movie. Example, McGonagall! She had such a small part, nothing about her clothing should have changed. Also the trek to Hagrid's cabin became a climbing adventure for no good reason. Energy was spent watching the scenery and distracting from the story. This movie was full of these unnecessary changes. So many opportunities were missed to promote continuity and join the series, not step off in a different direction. The actors did a fabulous job but the director missed opportunities again in not capturing proper emotion during a scene. Ex. Sirius and Harry! Harry is just realizing that his dream may be coming true to leave the Dursley's. He's found a family in Sirius! Sirius is thinking back to fond days with James and the more innocent days of teen year friendships. These are heavy emotions that are part of Rowling's story. The scene missed it! In a fast paced story line, the opportunity was gone. Subtlety and feeling is what brings magic to this story! This movie lost some of the magic!"
1534,6,Too much change and opportunities missed,"I admit that as a Snape-aholic I had very strong hopes that there would be the oft-promised, never delivered 'more Snape' in this film. After all, Snape figured fairly prominently in the book 'Prisoner of Azkaban,' in a way he hadn't in the previous books. We found out a bit about the motivations for his behavior toward Harry, didn't we? We found out about the relationship between Snape and the Mauraders during their Hogwarts days. In fact, it turns out to be important in a later book, doesn't it? And didn't Rowling once advise us to keep our eyes on Snape because he will turn out to be important?"
1535,,"Toto, I don't think we're at Hogwarts anymore","The third film of the Harry potter saga is by far the best yet, but still wasn't quite there. But then could did anyone really expect them to get it a perfect this time? Third time may be a charm, but no director could completely save this series in one film. But Alfonso Cuarón has obviously put the Harry potter franchise back on track. There are still some bugs that need fixing, like the fact that the whole film seems incredibly rushed. Yet, how is one to avoid that? Especially when the books keep getting longer and longer. The rushing also lead to a good bit of plot cuts, most which are understandable, though a few were unwisely made. But looking at it with a movie makers eye and not a book fans, you can be amazed at what Mr. Cuarón has done. He has finally established a solid feel for the films. Unlike Chris Columbus who just presented the material but didn't put any true artistic vision into it. The first to the stuff just kinda happened. In the third you can get a sense of more complex things happening than what you see on the screen and start to get a sense of emotion from the characters. It was nice to see the characters, especially the children, being there characters. In the first two films it was extremely obvious that these kids were acting, a problem that is still in the third at parts, but is improving immensely. The performances of the adults are improving too. All except Robbie Coltrane's, he seems to be turning the character of Hagrid into more of a caricature than a person. Michael Gambon does a wonderful job filling Richard Harrison's shoes as Albus Dumbledore. Although he doesn't keep the same sort a persona about him, his version of the character is much more enjoyable and, in my opinion, much more true to the book. David Thewlis does a splendid job portraying Professor Lupin. Although he does not look the part, he does a wonderful job playing it, giving Lupin the emotional feel I always imaged. He also does a great job setting a solid relationship between himself and Harry. A very master and apprentice feel is giving between them which, although it is not the kind of relationship you find between people is there situation, works very effectively. I would also like to note the great change in the music. John Williams new score contributes to the film much more than in the previous two. Very rarely do you hear the original theme he wrote that sounded more like clown music than anything else. Instead you here a wonderful score with a much more unique feel and seems to be played by more of a small chamber ensemble rather than a huge orchestra. All in all it is a much better film that actually makes you wait to see what happens next."
1536,,They're starting to get it right,"First I wish to congratulate the actors. They had some horrible constraints to work with and I thought they did a valiant job. I wish we could have seen more of Snape, Hagrid, and McGonagall in classroom settings. All of those actors are excellent, I especially love Alan Rickman. His lines are few but he delivers them with such beautiful timing and emphasis. Michael Gambon had to step into some very large shoes to fill and I think that while he will never be the perfect Dumbledore that Harris was, he held his own. The kids I thought were fantastic. Felton just continues to perfect his nastiness and we got to see that he really is a coward underneath it all. Watson was shown to be a stronger character and person and I cheer her on. Hermione is a wonderful character with passion and conviction. Grint is perfect as Ron, lovable and yet fierce at the same time. While J.K. is leading the relationship of Hermione and Ron slowly in the books, I realize that Hollywood nearly demands that it be broken sooner. I thought it was well dealt with and never left any question in my mind that the two will eventually be a couple. As for Radcliffe, to me he IS Harry. I believe him to be an extremely likable hero, brave, yet not afraid to show fear, loyal to his parents memories and friends and I love the tenderness he shows with Hermione. I have heard some say that they should be a couple, remember this is J.K.'s story arc not ours. His gentleness is not to be confused with romantic feelings for Hermione, it merely shows that even though he was unloved for most of his life he is strong enough and pure enough of heart to show love for others. Cheers Radcliffe, I think you were marvelous. I know it's unrealistic, but I hope they are able to keep the kids and the teachers the same for all the movies. They have brought to life the characters I dearly love and I would feel a real loss at some other actor trying to take the part. Please stick with it guys. I thought that the CGI Buckbeak and dementors were fabulous. I wish we could have seen multiple hippogryphs, but what they created was just as beautiful, proud and majestic as could be."
1537,,"my pos two cents worth (possible spoiler, beware)","i have read all of the books and have been anticipating the movies ever since. the 3rd book wasn't really my favorite of them all, but it was definitely in the top 5 (joke). the film with its new director and sort of revolutionary direction from the original 2 has made this film quite enjoyable. the movie was put together nicely and the story was portrayed very well; my only disappointments were that the scenery was different. i don't know if anyone else seems to notice or care, but as the film progressed i became ever more agitated that the castle was different, the lake and hagrids cabin were in different locations. again the film was very well done, yet my only qualm is with the different set. throughout the film i was very disappointed in this difference, because the original set seemed to be exactly what i imagined as i read the books. the change in directors was a good idea, but the change in setting feels like its taking away from the film and experience. i suppose i'll just leave this to conjecture; my opinion has been voiced."
1538,,good film; some disappointment... may contain spoiler,"Having read various reviews from film critics touting this film as the greatest Harry Potter of them all I was terribly disappointed upon seeing this poor rendition of a charming book. These critics seem to feel that going away from the book as much as possible makes the film great, where I feel that the director's portrayal did nothing by leech out all the magic and charm of the movie and make it into a typical mundane story about teenagers. "
1539,,A magical story directed by a Muggle,"After viewing the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, myself along with my accompaniment were quite downcast. This was probably due to the fact that we have read the books and the movie did not display the content in an enjoyable fashion. However, seeing this movie without reading the books beforehand may allow a person to enjoy it more so. The new director made a great movie alone, but whilst being compared to the novel it was quite substandard. The setting was different than in the previous movies and there was barely any character personality development. If seeing this movie without reading the books or seeing the previous two films, the audience would have no idea as to who or what the characters were truly like. The sequencing of events was out of order and the major events were not displayed to be very important. For being only a 2 and some hour movie, I would think the director could have added 15 more minutes to expand upon the plot line. The film moved at a very quick pace, which took away from the characters and events in the story. All in all, if the reason the film hardly compared to the novel was because it was a larger book than the previous two, I am barely looking forward to how the Goblet of Fire shall be portrayed after being over 100 more pages. Good luck next time Harry Potter."
1540,,Good luck next time!,"I am a great fan of Harry Potter. I love the books, and I loved the first two movies. They kept reasonably close to the plot, to please the die-hard fans, and let the average person who never read any of the books to enjoy the movies too. With that said, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, did not live up to the same standards of the first two movies."
1541,,Very Disappointing,"First of all, what was with the magic being used under the sheets at the beginning. To me, it looked a lot like he was trying to do something else other than homework. Anyway, two minutes later, Uncle Vernon tells Harry he knows he's not allowed to do magic outside of school. Another thing, they explained Aunt Marge's visit and the Knight Bus VERY poorly. What was with the talking Jamaican Head anyway? They added crap in place of very important scenes. Crap added: animal crackers that make you sound like the animal, the Fat Lady's opera ""humor"", that one kid that was always with Malfoy (Malfoy was never with both Crabbe and Goyle, he was with Crabbe OR Goyle plus with that random tall kid never mentioned in the book). Things that shouldn't have been left out: explanation of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs; how Lupin knew the Marauder's Map was a map, the Three Broomsticks (should have allowed children), Pigwidgeon (Ron's new owl), and the origin of the Firebolt. Where were half of the characters in this movie? Ginny had all of one line in the movie, Fred and George mainly just gave the Marauder's map to Harry, Mrs. Weasley's entire role was giving Scabbers back to Ron. And some of the characters were just.... off. Flitwick looked forty years younger, Parvati was ugly instead of pretty like she's described in book four, Dumbledore's beard was in a ponytail holder and Professor Lupin looked like a child molester. I had to explain what was happening to my friends who had never read the book, though I barely knew what was happening, what with the choppiness of the script and the negative explanation of half of the things. Those who are major fans of Harry Potter, like I am, don't bother wasting your money on the movie. I waited two hours in line for good seats at the movie for Hermione's fake looking punch (Hermione punched Malfoy instead of slap him) and an entirely different sounding prediction from Professor Trelawney which also wasn't explained!"
1542,,What a load of CRAP,"The movie is very good. I gave it an 8, but if you haven't read the book there are going to be parts where you won't know what's happening because they cut out some of the main points to make sure that the movie didn't run too long. So my suggestion is to read the book first or if you've already seen it and haven't read the book read it now. And the fact that the books keep getting longer is going to be a problem when making the movies because they, everyone involved with the film, have to cut out a lot of stuff so that people will be able to sit through the whole movie. Otherwise, and again, it was a very good movie and I recommend that you see it."
1543,8,Hey,"Well for the third installment of the Harry Potter flicks, this one was definitely the best. I did not like the first 2 very much but I found myself getting wrapped up in this one. I don't know if it was the slightly more decent acting, or the awesome story development. But either way I found this movie easier to follow without having read any of the books. And it seemed like all the old fans enjoyed this to. I mean one of the things I love the most about going to show is to see how the audience as a whole reacts, and it was definitely positive for this film. Overall I would rate this movie as scoring a 7 out of 10 in my book, Congrats to Alfonso Cuaron and crew for hooking another fan."
1544,,Not Bad,"First let me say that I realize that certain elements of the book had to be cut, but I feel that there were some very important elements left out, such as explanations for everything that happened throughout the entire movie. I saw the movie with my boyfriend (I have read the books several times, and he has not read them) and I had to explain more than half of the movie. I was so disappointed that I left the theatre actually ANGY, however, seeing that I have already read several reviews with the obvious complaints, I would like to add some of the small things that I was really looking forward to seeing in the movie, such as the Weasley twins, the Pocket Sneakoscope, and especially Sir Cadogan (who we saw briefly in the background). I am hoping that the new director for The Goblet of Fire will do a better job of explaining the new events that happen at Hogwarts and that some of the small details that make the books so wonderful will be included in the final cut."
1545,,Very Disappointed,"I was sorely disappointed when I watched this movie, especially since it is my favorite book of the series. The part I found most disturbing was the fact that the setting was all changed. Hagrid's hunt was in a noticeably different location, and everything from the paintings and certain structural differences in the castle were glaringly obvious. I was also really disappointed when they took the liberty of adding in their own scenes that had nothing to do with the book, like the shrunken heads, for instance, and the part were the boys are in the dormitory making animal noises. Now, I understand that certain liberties need to be taken when translating a book into a movie, but I felt they went to far. The movie was really busy and noisy and I felt it took away from the whole plot. I felt they did do a good job with Buckbeak, but the werewolf looked more like a mix between an alien and a skinny, hairless ape. It's going to take me a while to get used to this movie, and I'm not sure I ever will. I just hope the next one isn't so disappointing, especially if I'm going to wait in line for 4 hours to get tickets."
1546,,They made the movie into abstract art.,"After waiting for what seemed an eternity, I finally saw my favorite Harry Potter book on screen. I was terribly disappointed! There was so much depth from J.K. Rowlings book that was left out or simply trampled on by this new director. I was thrilled to see Gary Oldman on screen. However, the interaction between all of the characters seemed forced. Potter purists may come from this new movie unfulfilled. I truly hope that a new director is chosen to bring the Goblet of Fire to the screen and give us what we have come to expect. I must say that the portrayal of Buckbeak was right on the money. I don't know if the screen writers were trying to avoid another three hour movie but I am sure I speak for thousands when I say, we would have gladly sat four hours or more for a chance to see a genuine portrayal of emotions and ties that were captured in the books."
1547,,Director Disappointment,So many important details from the book were left out in the movie.
1548,,Okay...but certainly not as good as the first 2!,i cant believe I've seen a better movie at 10:30 at night that kept me up sure its darker then the first two and sure dumbledore isn't the same but its still awesome and it rocked my socks right back on and i would hope youd stop reading this and see the movie for the first second third fourth(still reading you should go and teen it!) fifth sixth great movie this movie lets us see how the school is with the third year of their schooling. All of the special effects looked sooo real that i actually thought that it was happening and it was real. i sound like I'm ten which I'm really not. it was very the same as the books. and it was very well directed out of ten i give it a ten so you should go out and see it right now!!!!
1549,10,so it rocked my socks on,"The movie did not do the book justice! This is my favorite book in the HP series, and I was disappointed not to feel the suspense and action I felt while reading it."
1550,,"best book, worst film","Overall, the movie was good but in the aspect of the story, it was awful and misleading. Several important details were missing that were very crucial to make the movie complete. The chronology of the events was intertwined and the director focused more on cinematography rather than staying close as possible from the book. The Headmaster was altered drastically, his personality and appearance were far from J.K Rowlings description and he had no longer have his powerful presence and commanding aura. There were many scenes that were unnecessary and the location of Hogwarts were also confusing and the way the director ended the movie was very lame, it should have ended on the part of the Dursley's knowing that the lunatic on the loose Sirius Black was indeed been Harry Potter's grandfather. The best rating that I could give this film is 5 out of 10."
1551,,Critics and Comments,"The only problem with this film, is that my expectations were too high. I should not have been a fan of the books because I came away feeling very disappointed. I would have liked to have seen Harry receive his Firebolt and it being confiscated, an explanation as to why Harry's Patronos took the shape that it did, and as it is crucial to the plot, reference to the fact that Lupin, James, Sirus, Peter and Snape all attended Hogwarts at the same time and with the exclusion of Snape, were friends. The fact that Padfoot, Wormtail etc were aware of Lupin's condition and the purpose of the Whomping Willow should also have been stated. The map was created by them and again no mention of this. It also would have been compelling to see the flashbacks of Harry's memory when the dementators were around. "
1552,,Disappointing,"Not only was the movie horrible, it was a waste of my $8.00. Harry Potter is one of my favorite book series, the third book my favorite. I've been waiting for June 4th for a long while counting down the days from 100. Going into the movie theatre excited as I was, almost peeing my pants with frenzy, just to be crashed down with the horrible graphic animations. Oh, and referring to Joseph Pintars comment, the new Dumbledore IS NOT better than the late Richard Harris. He didn't even look like him for god sakes! It's not a movie worth waiting to see, and I suggest that any whom haven't seen it, don't because it's not worth it. In conclusion: I shook my fist many a times at the screen."
1553,,A movie NOT worth waiting to see.,I have read sixty or so comments about Harry Potter 3. A lot of people seemed upset that the film took out a lot of important information from the books. I am not going to disagree and that is certainly a very valid complaint. However I still think that Harry Potter 3 was easily the best of Potter movies so far.
1554,,Character Development Film,Last night my wife and I went to the cinema to see Harry Potter. We watched a very long trailer and suddenly there were the credits. Apparently that was the movie.
1555,,"Nice Trailer, where's the movie?","I am a huge fan of JKR and her talent. However, I was a bit disappointed with the 3rd film. I thought the director did a rather poor job on the continuity of the storyline when compared to the book (too choppy), there were changes (ie. Hagrid's hut had been moved, the whomping willow was in a new location, etc.) that should not have been made. I enjoyed seeing the characters again but feel it should have been better. I hope they find another director for the 4th film that will bring the quality of the book into the movie. Afterall, the entire cast is wonderful but they need someone with the vision from the book to bring out their characters so the story, as written, will be brought to life! I would only give it a 3 out of 5 stars."
1556,,My Thoughts on the Third Film,"I felt that the acting was better in this film and Harry's character was a little more developed. Hermione's character was also great, but the movie did not fully capture her growth from the book. For instance, in the book Hermione is overextended with classes, is in a fight with Ron because of her cat Crookshanks, and alienates Harry because of the broom situation and his illegal visit to Hogsmeade (and getting caught by Malfoy and having to rush back only to be caught by Snape). My friend who watched the movie, but didn't read the book, asked what was wrong with Hermione when she"
1557,8,PoA critique...,Yesterday I finally got a chance to go to the theater and to watch it.
1558,,"Reflections about this new movie (ATTENTION for the ones who hasn't watched it yet, it's a SPOILER: I might be spoiling the movie for you by giving away some events)","Frankly, the film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, was sort of a disappointment. Of course, as with the previous movies, even Chris Columbus' directing could not--by far--compare to Rowling's superb series. The new director took the movies on a whole different level. I liked how Cuaron delved into the series on a darker note, because this book was definitely a turning point in the series. Nevertheless, seeing as Cuaron--until he began directing--had never read a page of the Harry Potter books, or even seen the first two films, he wasn't a fan of the young wizard from the start. Because it is an ongoing series, the movie needed a little bit more ""flow"" to it because it fits out of place from the rest of the films. Hogwarts had always been a cheery place that Harry looked forward to each summer. Yet, in this movie, everything--including Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--seemed all too dreary. The worst part of the new directing was how much was cut out of the movie. For example, Quidditch was always a big part of Harry's life, but in the film they cut the entire season down to just one extremely short scene. Unfortunately, the movie just seemed so rushed, when some parts needed to be lengthened in order to get an effect. All in all, the movie was indeed, enjoyable, but there is much room for improvement. My fellow Potter-heads will see where I'm coming from :)."
1559,,"I'd recommend it, but...",(this review will contain spoilers to the movie)
1560,,mixed feelings on the movie,"Very disappointing. This movie does not have the spark & magic of the first two, possibly because there was a different director. It also left out important details and ended differently from the book. I'm surprised Ms. Rowling allowed this as a representation of her book, which has been a favorite with many fans. Everyone I've talked to feels the same way. Also, Harry, Ron and Hermione are looking a little too ""glamorous"" for their ages, and older than the 13 they're supposed to portray. The other youths in the movie are also growing up too quickly, and are almost unrecognizable from the 1st 2 movies. Perhaps take advice from the making of LOTR and speed things up before they start looking too old? Emma Thompson's character of ""Professor Trelawny"" did not have enough exposure, and left out a vital, dire prediction for Harry!"
1561,,I waited this long for ...!,"Spoiler I went to this movie with the expectation of it being as good as the book. Sadly it was not as good as the book. The book kinda carried you away, I felt like while i watched the movie there was a barrier there keeping me from seeing what was really going on. "
1562,,"Good, but needed more!","After a year of waiting, I was not satisfied to see this movie. If you LOVE only the special effects (I loved them too) then this movie is more than great but this movie didn't keep the story straight. If you haven't read the book you'll find it hard to relate a few scenes.The movie also lack COLORS.... Buckbeak seems gray, almost like made out of clay.I expected a bit color in it's feathers, eyes.Dumbledore is supposed to be a strong yet comforting character not a ponytail bearded old man.Being in Hogwarts supposed to be dressed as witches or wizards not as muggles.Muggle clothes in Hogwarts is absolutely disturbing.Also didn't see suspicion build up about Hermione getting 2 classes at a time.I sure hope to see different director for next movie who might try to be honest to the books."
1563,,"This movie is based on special effects only,story is not straight.",*WARNING: A few spoilers are located in this review*
1564,,"Huh, I was slightly disappointed...",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best yet. The plot was amazing and all the humor in the movie made it even better. Alfonso Cuarón did a great job taking over as director. 
1565,10,the best yet,"I don't think I have ever been so excited to see a movie before. I was honestly giddy. Here I am, a nineteen year old girl who is literally skipping into the movie theatre and can't stop giggling because she is so excited. And then the lights go down and I'm hysterical. I thought, ""It's time, finally!"" For the first part of the movie I thought ""This is great"", then came the middle of the movie-""ummm...OK"", then the end, ""are you joking me?"". All in all I don't know what to think. Obviously I'm a fan of Harry Potter, I love the books and saying I've read each one(with the exception of OOTP)at least 15 times is not an overstatement. Reading the Harry Potter series, as sad as it might sound, is a hobby of mine. When the first two movies came out I was pleasantly surprised with how accurate they were, yes there were many changes, but for those non-readers who only saw the movies I felt they were still able to get the jist out of them. But after this one I feel like they need an explanation of what was going on. Looking at the movie, from a movie perspective, the movie was good. It had great special effects and did a really good job with keeping your attention. "
1566,,What to think?,"Bring Back Chris Columbus PLease!!!!I hate the movie changing the sets squeezing parts of the book in a 2 min sequence cutting the characters to hec... if the movie takes 3 hours to follow the book then make the movie 3 hours.... This hast to be the worst choice for a director of Harry potter possible.. if you did not read the book you probably would not even know y sequences were in the movie..secondary characters were cut to shreds. In what book is dumbledorf portrayed as an Oof ...hes supposed to be the best wizard in the world and this movie makes him look like an imbecile ...WARNER BROThERS, the books are a success so if your not gonna follow the book , Don't MAKE The MOVIE The original sets are different hogwarts is different all for the worst.. The quidditch match is a travesty I wont even buy the DVD this movie sucks"
1567,,IF your not gonna make the book don't make the movie,"I've seen the movie twice now. The second time was better because I knew what to expect. Overall, the movie was good. I thought some of the scenes were too short and valuable information was left out for the sake of time. This information such as the history of the Maurarder's Map and the role of Crookshanks the cat in helping Sirius get into the castle will come up later in the later film adaptations. They will have to in order for the story to make sense."
1568,9,Almost but not quite,"Being a Harry Potter purist the 3rd movie in the series was a large disappointment. I sat through the very short movie constantly thinking to myself and sometimes outloud, ""WHAT!"", ""They cut that out"", ""thats not right."" The largest gripes that I have with the movie are as follows:"
1569,,Disappointing,"In general I enjoyed the movie, but I was not pleased with it. The hippogriff was really well made, hagrid was taller, as tall as he should be (in the book), but that's about it. The movie was too fast, there were no transitions and it should've been much more longer, at least 3 hours. There was no Christmas, Halloween, nor any other scenes that would bring warmth to the movie. In general, it was much too dark and Hogwarts was too small from the interior. The 2 first movies were much better, because they had more magic in it, by that I mean that they were more enchanting to the eyes. Cuaron tried to do a horror movie, Harry potter is suppose to be wonderful, but the prisoner of Azkaban was not! It was a good movie, but only ordinary and it don't deserve to be in the top 250 best movies from IMDb, so an average of 7.9 is much too high for a movie like this. People aren't enough subjective, they loved the potter saga and they voted with it... they rated that movie too high."
1570,6,"The film is not bad, but there's a big lack of magic!","I just saw Prisoner of Azkaban on IMAX and it just blew me away, it was so immersive. The big detailed picture and the amazing soundsystem made this the best Hollywood movie I have seen in the last 5 years."
1571,9,IMAX version is stunning!,"The director did AMAZING magic with this movie; he managed to absolutely and completely suck ALL the charm out of Harry Potter! True book fans will be sadly disappointed. It was Hitchcock does Harry Potter. The only bright light was Emma Thompson. She did a great job as Professor Trelawny. Even the HP regulars seemed to have forgotten how to act. I agree with a previous comment; I just can't believe that JK Rowling approves of this movie. It was very oddly filmed too. All of the characters seemed abnormally tall and thin. Some odd filming. Everything was oddly lighted. Everything was just ugly. They stunted significant plot points and, well, at risk of repeating myself - left out all of the charm of the books. What a shame."
1572,,Amazing (bad) magic!,"I went to a movie last night, although, I'm not quite sure which one. I THOUGHT I was going to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but I saw a jumbled mess of teen with a hint of a wand. The actors did a superb job with what they were given, but if you start a series, you must follow the format and see it through to the end. This had none of the magical feeling upon arriving at Hogwarts. Dumbledore seemed like he was comic relief, instead of the wise and fatherly figure he had been. The scenes that were there, half of THOSE could have been omitted to allow the actual story to appear. I agree with an earlier reader that it would have been interesting to see the Christmas gift broomstick instead of the end. There was absolutely no connection between the first set of movies and these, it felt as though I was not watching Harry Potter at all. Snape was not at all important in the movie. He didn't even accuse Harry of letting Black go free. There was no outstanding revelation as there had been in the first two. And I missed seeing the ride home on the train. "
1573,,Where's the magic?,"although i enjoyed this installment of HARRY POTTER, i can't say that i wasn't just a little disappointed by it's inconsistencies from the first two. the complete change to the settings were a little distracting after having them be identical in the other films (i.e., hogwarts grounds being on hillsides, the dursley kitchen, hagrid's hut, etc.), the cgi of buckbeak & the dementors was AMAZING, but the werewolf was a little too wyle e. coyote for me, the lack of uniform standards when they were worn was puzzling, & the addition of a new crony for malfoy was odd. the storyline was also a little choppy, but i expected that from a 350+ page book. needless to say, ""somewhat sloppy & choppy"" are the VERY worst things i can say about a film that i'll be sure to see several more times in the theater & own the day it becomes available on DVD. i look forward to the fourth."
1574,,a little disappointing,"Yes, sure i suppose you could say i was drawn into the whole ""Harry Potter phenomenon"" but i was extremely pleased to see the new installment in theaters. Although i have read the book many times, it was exciting for me to witness the story being played out in the theater. The music was amazing as well. I was very pleased by the changes of it too. The setting had a lot more depth to it and much more interest. The castle changes were interesting too. All of the characters have obtained a more advanced view on their roles and that pleased me. I am a bit disappointed how they have left out a few parts of the book which i felt were important, or at least very interesting in the film. Overall though i found the movie to be exciting and intriguing and i would suggest it to anyone that was willing to listen to me to go see it."
1575,10,absolutely amazing,"Don't get me wrong, the head was cool (creepy, but cool) but NOWHERE was there a shrunken head in the book. Just a pet peeve, lol."
1576,,What the heck was that shrunken head doing on the bus??,"Because this movie was based on my favorite HP book and because I had also read some very encouraging film reviews, I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I found that I was majorly disappointed. The biggest disappointment I think for me was the fact that they completely left out the explanation of the map and who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were. I'm sorry but that's an integral part of the whole book!They also just glossed over Harry's patronus taking the form of a stag and it's significance. I would have gladly had them trim the Aunt Marge scene and the Knight Bus scene and have had them add another 15 minutes to the pivotal scene in the whole movie (the scene in the Shrieking Shack). The dialogue and interaction between Lupin, Sirius, Snape and Pettigrew could have been so much more exciting, enthralling and informative had they followed the book. On the upside the scenery and cinematography was outstanding. The special effects for the dementors and Buckbeak were fabulous. But here again they majorly disappointed me with a werewolf that was totally horrendous. They went the Hollywood way and make a creature that was so unlike a wolf it was pathetic and not particularly scary. If they bothered to read JKR's books they'd know that the werewolf she describes is so close to a real wolf that there are only 5 minor differences that tell them apart (eyes, snout shape, tuft on tail...). Overall I enjoyed the movie but I guess I should have learned by now that they will always disappoint. The books will always and forever be better."
1577,,Disappointing,"OK, if you've liked the harry potter books, you will hate the movie! there are many things that either A. didn't happen in the movie, but happened in the book. B. happened in the movie, but not the book. C happened in the book, and was portrayed HORRIBLY in the movie! and nothing's the way that it's supposed to be! the director didn't know what he was doing, with two movies already done, he changed the image of many of the characters, and changed the costumes! i'm not going to write what happened exactly at the end, but i'll tell you this, IF YOU'VE READ THE BOOK, DON'T THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING! well that's true through out the movie, but it becomes too much to take at the end! and if you've noticed from Hermione's hair in the poster, she doesn't have frizzy hair anymore! her hair is perfectly fine, and she's pretty! Hermione's not supposed to get pretty until the yule ball in the 4th book!!!!!!!!!!"
1578,1,NOTHI NG like the book!,First of all I am a huge Harry Potter book fan. That being said i was unimpressed with the movie being true to the book. i realize that sometimes there are certain liberties taken with movie that were books first but this movie took too many. 
1579,,What were they thinking?,"Harry potter is an amazing set of books, and, up until now, has made some really enjoyable movies, however, this latest movie disappoints anyone who truly likes harry potter. I think I can safely say that what really makes people love Harry Potter books and movies, is the feeling you get when you are enveloped in the Hogwarts way of life. The Prizoner Of Azkaban COMPLETELY missed the mark. Lack of robes, and a real drought where magic class scenes are concerned really dampens the spirit, along with the fact that, even though the new hogwarts is, i suppose, more majestic and grand, it lacks the magic spark and the aura of awe that the old one most definitely had. Aside from that issue, the movie is also very confusing to those who have not read the book (or have forgotten it since they read it), and disconnected (the ending is SHOCKING! Myself, and everyone else I have talked to have been speechless at how they ended it. Completely LAME) Therew is also no character development, especially on important new characters such as Professor Lupin, and Serius Black. j.K. Rowling Intended for the reader to warm up to the former by the end of the movie, but the exact opposite happened in the movie. Also, there are random things thrown in an a seeming attempt to add some ""humor"". A talking Rastafarian skull in the knight bus? I mean... come on. All in all, I was SO disappointed, especially that I will now have to wait AGAIN for more good Harry Potter stuff. I advise just reading the book. If you really wanna go see a movie, see shrek 2."
1580,,"Sadly, a HUGE letdown. Director change = BAD IDEA","Personally, I found the movie to be quite amusing on several occasions. It was much different than the first two films. I only have a few complaints of the movie. I realize that you can't expect any director to put everything from a book to a movie. The movie wasn't exactly a ""perfect"" adaption. The movie seemed to be in a hurry with the story. Being that I have read the story twice and it is my favorite out of all of the books (I'm admitting to be a bookworm), I practically know the story by heart. Just watching the movie made me feel as though the director was quickly presenting to the audience a summary of the story. "
1581,,Better than the first two . . . but still not quite satisfactory,"This installment of the Harry Potter series had many highs and many lows. With the new director you could certainly sense a different feel for the movie. From the opening camera shot that wasn't as clean as the past two, to the beautiful camera angles throughout the movie, Harry Potter 3 had an independent film's artsy quality. The beautiful way in which it was shot aside, this movie was very rushed. I felt many of the important details were left aside and shouldn't have been. The lack of explanation of Lupin and Sirius was the most disappointing. Those of us who have read the books understand their importance, but those who watched this for the first time were left in the dark."
1582,8,Details left aside,I was disappointed in this film for a few reasons. 
1583,5,Disappointment,"Having been much disappointed by the deviations from the Harry Potter book series by the first two films, all was redeemed with ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"". The movies-for-commercialism's sake had driven the story lines in a non-Potter direction, but they find the road again with this latest edition."
1584,,Prisoner break's free of commercialized plots - Spoilers -,All of the shots were much too tight. 
1585,,Firebolt... the Freshmaker (some SPOILERs),"I have just watched the film and I am so disappointed with what I saw. I am a huge Harry Potter fan as are my children. I think the books are fantastic and just keep getting better with each installment. I expected the movies to follow suit. I was disappointed with the first two movies as well as they seemed a little cheesy but they followed the books' story lines fairly well and I felt that was the most important thing. With a new director I had high hopes for the third movie, and in some ways it was better, but there were more ways in which it was worse."
1586,,So disappointed!,"The Harry Potter books used to be my favorites (until I discovered Tolkien), and like the books these movies can't hold a candle to the LOTR films. However, this was definitely a good film, the best so far. The Chamber of Secrets was my favorite in the series, but this movie is much more well done. Still, so many major details were omitted from the film, things that didn't necessarily confuse me, but disappointed me, especially more info on moony/wormtail/padfoot/prongs, because those names symbolize so much throughout the book (like Harry's stag patronus)and even more they are important in the fourth and fifth books too. Also,I thought Emma Thompson was awesome as Professor Trelawney (my favorite HP character), but was underused. The Quidditch Cup was a hilarious scene from the book, an extra 15 minutes or so wouldn't hurt the running time of this movie, so why not include it? Maybe I shouldn't, but I can't help but compare it to LOTR, which is unfair, but still. PJ's changes from the LOTR novels made relevant sense (except for the omission of Glorfindel) and didn't bother me but these HP changes are just too much. Also, in the books Hermione was mildly annoying yet amusing, but in the movie she was downright grating on my nerves. I wanted Malfoy to punch her instead. There was too much sexual innuendo as well...This is a good movie,very well done with nice scenery but I think you can appreciate it more if you HAVEN'T read the books, because then the omissions won't be as glaring and noticeable. Still, 8 out of 10."
1587,9,Best of the moves,"I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high for the film, but when I left the theater I was left with the ""that's it"" feeling in my stomach. I was so excited to go, I had been waiting for what seemed an eternity to see the third installment of Harry Potter and it just wasn't as good as it could have been. By far the third book is my favorite in the series but the movie cuts out a lot of the personal interaction of the characters (especially Ron and Hermione). The movie just feels like it's moving too fast. One of my friends with whom I saw the movie, had seen both of the other two movies but had not read the books, by the end of the movie he was actually asking us to explain what in the world had happened, he had got entirely lost. This begin said, This movie was be far not the worst movie that I've seen lately. Some of my other friends actually thought that it was really good (although they were disappointed that there was not more Quidditch). I did think that it had superb special effects (as always). I just think that I liked the directing of Christopher Columbus better. Apparently, the fourth movie is going to have still another director so I'm hoping that the it will be better. I'm not going to let this disappointment turn me off of Harry Potter I am eagerly awaiting the fourth film."
1588,7,I thought it was disappointing but my friends enjoyed it,"harry potter 3, the movie, was such crap i was insulted by it. dementors are supposed to be gliding, tall, towering creatures with hoods over their heads: not 4 feet tall, flying, with balloon-like heads and holes where their mouths are supposed to be."
1589,,Crap,"Harry Potter 3- Prisoner of Azkaban, perhaps the most interesting book because it leads the plot into the Comeback of You-Know-Who himself BUTTTT the movie does not do that!! My assumption is that the Producers had made TOO MANY assumptions that the WATCHERS have already read the book and are only watching the movie for the graphics...which is NOT the case.... Simply put, the movie was not long enough....the scene changes were too abrupt it was more like a theater show...transitions weren't smooth enough...though yes they had to have the blackout scenes...and the comments of Ron on Hermoine was too repetitive...the film was to short for him to comment about it in every class....and Hermoine's temper outburst, was due to too much stress, which they did not really portray, also, the writers of the Marauder Map...How else will Moony know how to use the map?!"
1590,,Truthful opinions about the entire production..,"The problem when we take literature and turn it into a film, the reading purists never seem to be satisfied. The other problem is for the average movie goers, and why sequels are never good enough, is our expectations become too high for the film to succeed. Harry Potter is a series, not a trilogy, or whatever the correct term will be when all whatever are made. It is not one epic story; instead it is several small adventures that the characters experience. With that said, the ultimate ""problem"" Harry Fans are the fans that did not read the first book, until they saw the movie, then started reading, so in there minds eye, Daniel Radcliffe is used for Harry, and Columbus's vision of Hogwarts et all becomes our vision. So now we bring in another interpretation, and quite frankly I was very satisfied. This film had a more naturalistic approach to lighting and framing, and the Director used his style and the use of a grainier film to achieve something that this story has, that the others do not. A darker, more realistic use of imagery that goes hand in hand with the book. "
1591,,Get over it please?,"I've read all five books several times each and I just LOVE them. That's why, when the first film came, I just had to see it. At first I didn't really like it, but it grew on me and now I love the two first films. And then came the third..."
1592,,What was he thinking?!,"I usually attend a movie like the Prisoner of Azkaban, a movie which has had a rather large buildup, with high expectations. Generally this is asking for trouble. However this time I left the cinema feeling more than content with what I had seen. The last movie I attended was the third part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I prayed that the Prisoner of Azkaban would not be a similar experience as I had spent the majority of the second half of the Return of the King worrying more about my numb bottom than the story. The Prisoner of Azkaban easily left me feeling more comfortable with spending my money at the cinemas than any movie I have seen for many years. It was quick paced, funny in parts, yet still darker as the books have described and did a great justice for the terrific ending that j.k rowling had created. Sure there were some parts of the third book totally ignored in the movie of the prisoner of azkaban but I didn't intend on seeing a 5 hour movie. I thought the director did a wonderful job and after almost falling asleep during the chamber of secrets I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the movie flowed. It is not often I return to the cinemas to see the same movie a second time but I think I may have to break that trend this time around!"
1593,,Going back for more,"Sorry, you guys blew it, big time!!!! This one is impossible to follow if you haven't read the book. Dumbledore looks more like he is wandering around in his pyjamas, which hardly befits the headmaster of such a school. Also, I seriously doubt that the kids would have been allowed to attend classes with their shirts poking out and looking like a bunch of slobs. Hogwarts has standards you know. Sorry, I doubt if I will see this one again. The first two movies, I saw a minimum of five times each while it was still in the theaters. Even my grandchildren found this film lack luster and have not asked to see it again. YOUR LOSS, literally. It might be a good idea if you tried to remember who your audience is. Please tell me that number 4 will not be ""edgy"" and ""hip"" as Azkaban was ""suppose"" to been. That would only turn off Potter fans and they are the ones that buy the tickets. Better luck with the next director."
1594,,Better luck next time.,"I was thoroughly disappointed with PoA. Maybe it's because I am 21, and I'm not into all the fun, silly stuff; or maybe because I like the dark stuff more than younger kids would. Either way, I just felt that this story and all the left out scenes were too important to the continuance of the whole Harry Potter story to have been left out or not explained. I actually enjoyed the first two movies a whole lot. GoF is nearly twice the size of PoA, and if anyone thinks they can fit the whole story into less than at least 3 1/2 hours, without making two movies of it, they must be mental. I liked Malfoy always being a bully, but I liked him being taught the hard way who was really in charge. I didn't like seeing him near tears though, it was kinda out of character. I also wanted to see Snape under the Mobilus Corpus, or whatever, spell; where he was purposely allowed to hit his head along the tunnel. And I didn't care to much for the Shrunken heads, but once again maybe it's because of my age. They need to get over the whole cheesy crap, the shortening films, and trying to sugarcoat the whole troublesome and dark reality of the great Harry Potter stories, even if they have to make it PG-13. Like that is a bad thing!!! I want to see some reall action like in the first two movies. I want to see Snape and Harry go at it. I want to see the Death Eaters show their faces once and for all. Am I wrong for wanting this?"
1595,,I don't care what you others may think....,"Azkaban is very much a middle chapter of a work in progress. It moves the Harry Potter story forward by introducing Sirius Black and filling in more of the back story. As a stand alone film though it has weaknesses summed up by Harry himself in the coda at the end of the film when he says that nothing that has happened has made very much difference. In the previous two films there was an identifiable bad guy who got his comeuppance, at least temporarily, giving the films a sense of closure. This chapter doesn't really close it just sets up the next film. "
1596,9,Very much a middle chapter,"This movie was not of what i expected. The character development was absent and many important parts of the plot were missing. The direction was taken to a new level. I understand the 3rd book was a little more intense and ""horror"" like, but the movie presented itself in a almost ""creepy"" way. Also, there was minimal transitions from the 2nd movie to the 3rd movie, and left little doors open for the next movie. It almost seemed like the series could of ended with the 3rd book. The replacement of dumbledore was disappointing as well. Although no one can live up to Richard Harris's role as the famous Headmaster, the new actor could have tried to fit the role. So i hope with the new direction of the 4th movie, it will be better."
1597,6,Disappointed,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a great movie. The story line was great and the special effects were great as well, not just like the book but great still the same. I've seen it twice in the first week that it opened and still think it's a great movie. I don't understand all this stuff about people saying it's to scary for small kids and some of the content isn't for younger viewers. Watching the movie I didn't see anything that shouldn't have been there. I think people just ignore the fact that people in real life and characters in stories do grow up and change. That being said there still wasn't any offensive material in the movie or material that isn't fit for younger viewers. Sure there were events that were left out of the movie that were in the book but all and all it was a great movie and I recommend it for all to see. Another thing I liked was how from the first movie to the third you can see the actors who play the rolls get better and better. The casting for this movie couldn't have been better and I'm looking forward to the next and future installments that I hope continue to have the same actors playing the rolls!!! If I had to give this movie a letter grade it would get an A-, the A- because there is always room for improvement."
1598,10,Harry Potter 3,"I think Alfonso did a terrible job at keeping the movie true to the book. If you didn't read the books, then it was a good movie. if you did read the book, then it was an insult to J. K. Rowling."
1599,6,Not true to the book!,"SPOILERS POSSIBLY AHEAD I was so ready to see the beautifully written PoA on screen. To see the enchanting vision that J.K.Rowling so aptly created. I could not wait to see; the village of Hogsmeade,prepare to meet Buckbeak and the tiny owl, who Sirius gives to Ron, experience the Knight bus, to be frightened by the Dementors, be thrilled by the Marauder's Map, and all of its secrets, just to be transported once again into that excellent world of magic where broomsticks fly and willows whomp,but alas the film fell flat. Some of the previous were addressed, but not in a fashion befitting this book, more like an episode of any gritty crime drama on T.V.."
1600,,"Very disappointed, not transported.","Well... For starters: I liked it very much. It has a kind of darkness to it we haven't seen in a Harry Potter movie before. The only reason i give a 9 instead of 10 is because you notice certain changes. Perhaps because there a new director... But you still use the first 15 min. to find the spirit of the film. I'm sorry that A. Cuarón does not hit the same stile as the first 2 Harry Potter films, but it is a fresh new angle and whether you like it or not IT WORKS. That said... Enjoy the best Harry Potter movie to this date..."
1601,9,Almost there...,"I highly praise the job well done by the new director of the third installment of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Altho the plot stretched a bit thin at times, it is completely understandable considering the fact they only had 2 and a half hours to work with, given the length of the book. I have not read the 3rd book yet (in fact, I only bought the first book this past weekend) I did not feel lost at any point in this film. However, anyone watching this film without having either read the previous books or seen the previous movies will have a tougher time deciphering, but that's b/c this IS the third installment. (A friend of mine had that very problem.) I highly suggest that anyone slightly interested in Harry Potter go to see this film, b/c it is the best of the three. (I also find that each new movie is better than the preceding film.)"
1602,10,two thumbs up,"i though this film was absolutely awesome! alfonso was directed the film exactly as it should have been from the book/film 1 to now. Chris columbus also did a great job and i can see good sides in both directors. I did however feel the time lapse in the first one, wheras in Azkaban i didn't look down at my watch. It lacked some of the detail which the book provides you with but so have the first ones and its a fact of life that you cannot fit all that detail in. We basically saw snapes hatred for Harry- however it wasn't so much shown for lupin, yet neither was any of the Mooney, Padfoot, Prongs and Wormtail scenario so it didn't need to be. "
1603,,AWESOME!,I've been weighting for this movie to be released for over a year and when it finally came out I couldn't wait to see it  wish I could say I had the same feeling after.
1604,10,"Good, but disappointing",I only want to add a very short comment from me :
1605,10,Too short to be Harry Potter !,"It is obvious that the director of the latest Harry Potter is unaware of the proprietary attitude that fans have towards the books, it appears to me that he has cut and pasted the story to suit himself. Although the main story was faithful to the book the quirky details that make Harry Potter what it is are noticeable by there absence. Where's Peeves?? Where are the other ghosts especially Sir Nicolas? Why only one Hippogriff. I feel that it is a very well done and entertaining movie. but as a die hard Potter fan I think it is not a faithful rendition and is missing many of the fun elements that make Harry Potter such an original. Finally he made unnecessary changes to things such as scenery. Hagrid's Hut and the Whomping Willow are now outside the castle grounds. Fans feel comfortable with continuity and are upset when it is not maintained. The movie will be much enjoyed by people who haven't read the book, fans of the novel will not be as impressed."
1606,,A radical departure.,"Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban a film directed by:Alfonso Cuaron,produced by:Chris Colombus(former director of HP),David Heyman & Mark Radcliffe & written by the talented J.K.Rowling.The Film is full of Adventure,Fantasy & is comforting for the whole family to sit and watch.The film is set in a magical world full of witches & wizards but the main place is Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry.The main characters in the film are:Harry Potter,Ron Weasley,Hermione Granger,Sirus Black and Professer R.J.Lupin. Harry is about to start his third year at Hogwarts but he accidentally blows up his aunt and runs away.He is picked up by a magical bus(Knight bus) & meets the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge and he remains in the Leaky Cauldron.But he wasn't expelled from school because he used magic.Harry finds out that a convicted mad murderer named Sirus Black has escaped from Azkaban prison & that he's possibly coming after him.Harry now is in great danger because Black is known to be one of the supporters of You Know Who(Lord Voldmeort).But this isn't Harry's only problem when going to Hogwarts school Harry discovers that the Dementors(guards of Azkaban prison)are guarding the school until Black is captured.The dementors are vicious,demonic creatures that suck your worst memories and fears.The dementors have great affect on Harry because of his past.So Professer Lupin,the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher,teaches Harry a spell to repel the dementors but we discover that Professer Lupin has some secrets of his own. The roles of Harry,Ron,Hermione,Sirus Black & Professer Lupin are played by the magnificent Daniel Radcliffe,the humorus Rupert Grint,the brilliant Emma Watson,the talented Gary Oldman & the wolf of movies David Thewlis."
1607,,It was OK!!!!!!!!,"i really didn't like this movie because it was too short they left too many things out, had things in the wrong place the special effects did nothing for me !!!!"
1608,,i was disappointed,"After anticipating this movie for so long, I was sorely disappointed. Why has the whole set changed? Did Hogwarts move to a different school and location? In the first 2 movies directed by Chris Columbus gave you an insite about what the book was about. They flowed smoothly from scene to scene and really established a connection to the characters. I've read all J.K.Rowlings books and was surprised to see that she accepted ""The Prizoner of Azkaban"" script. It didn't follow what we all have come to expect of the Harry Potter movies; the places we have all become familiar with, the grounds, Hogwarts and the Great Hall. It's as though you are going to the same school since your first year, you know the lay out and the grounds very well, then you attend the same school and your lost! The movie was very choppy and was directed as though the person didn't read the book at all, just did a little scene from each chapter and thought;let me get this over with as quickly as possible. Please.......Chris Columbus come back. No one can do justice to J.K.Rowlings books but you."
1609,,Sooo Disappointed,"I read somewhere that Cuaron did not read Harry Potter 3 before commencing work on the movie. I was therefore NOT expecting too much when I viewed the film on opening day. (Don't expect too much and you are often pleasantly surprised) Mostly, I was disappointed in the length, and depth. The length of the film is relatively short, BUT why? There is so much from the book that was left out, you always expect that. But surely the film could be longer to fit more in. I found myself staring at the screen credits searching for more (I never do that)."
1610,4,"A brave adaptation of HP3, but not enough depth.","I'm a big fan of the books, but I can't stand the movies. While the acting abilities of the lead actors have improved, the movies cannot be compared to the books. What's the use of making a movie, if you do not stick to the book. If you wanna make a movie appealing, at least follow the book in some manner. This movie deprives us of our right to watch a movie which actually gives us a sense of feeling that we are reading the book. While it shows the darker side of Harry, what else does it offer? If we want to see a film driven by a fantasy of art we will go and see it. Harry Potter is not driven by art, it is driven by compelling wizardry, teenage fantasy, and evil. Reading the books gave me pleasure, watching the movies make me cringe."
1611,,Just like the rest of the movies,"I thought that HP3 was very good. All the twists and turns that J.K. Rowling and the producers/writers include in the movies and books are great. It keeps people wanting more. Whoever thought that HP, HP2, and HP3 weren't good or even remotely worth watching a second time needs to read the books. So many people can relate to Harry Potter, that is why people like him. If you don't like HP and have/haven't read the books please tell me why, I would like to know. So I can't wait until the next movie comes out and I advise all people to see the movies and read the books. Happy reading and watching!"
1612,10,HP3 was awesome!,"The third Harry Potter installment begins fresh. For a moment one thinks: ""oh, Cuarón wants to try something new, how brave of the lad"". Indeed, the mandatory Dursley beginning is filmed in a gritty, faded color, real world like TV style. And there's tons of atmosphere, nice images, good acting, some humor, some excitement, some scares and some action. It's all there except...where's the story? "
1613,,fair but where's the story at...,"I have now seen this film 3 times, and it just gets better and better. However, if you haven't seen it yet then be warned, Alfonso Cuaron has completely reworked the set. Hagrid's hut is no longer across the lawn, as in the first 2 films and all of the books, but is halfway down a mountain. Michal Gambon is good as Dumbledore, and Professor Trelawny is brilliant, but Lupin is a disappointment."
1614,7,Different...,"As a true lover of the book series and having read all of them (some more than once), I was disappointed in the film basically because I felt it was not true to the book. It deleted information that I felt was important and added scenes not in the book, or used elements from the book and put them together in a fashion that did not happen in the book. I may be boring, but I am the person who wants to see the ""book come to life"" the way the author wrote it, not just an interpretation of it. "
1615,,Very Disappointed,"First of all, i have read all of the harry potter books to date and i think they are all amazing. With the first being introductory to the series and a bit confusing at first, but necessary. The second one i think was mainly filler, but it was still good, the movie wasn't that great, however. prisoners of Azkaban introduced the idea that the series was going to get darker and finally got the story moving and twisting into a spiral that leads to the last book. Goblet of fire was also a great book like the others, it became even darker and emphasized on prisoners of azkaban in the fact that harry potter isn't going to be a nice calm story about a wizard though. and finally the order of the pheonix introduced action and responsibility to the characters of harry potter. Wow i got a little of subject but its hard not to review everything thats out so far. Anyway, I highly recommend that fans and non-fans of harry potter go see this movie. It really hops back and makes up for what the chamber of secrets wasn't. Thankfully under a new director, alfonzo cuaron or however its spelled. I hope he does the 5th book because his idea of how the harry potter series should work is by far the best seen on the silver screen yet. It rivals with the first movie, but it improves on everything that everyone loved about the first one. Also, the characters are growing up, and so are the actors. I think they portray this very well with hermione getting a sense of style, even though shes not really supposed to look great until the 4th installment. I think the way the harry potter movies have slowly but surely made her more and more mature have done a great job in doing that. As Emma always been a great actor for hermione. Not to mention rons character, he was great in the first one, and annoying in the second one. But in prisoners of azkaban he really shows his color as hes learned more about the character. Rupert really got the character down this time. And Daniel playing harry, he has improved the character a lot, he still needs to show more emotion at times, but all in all he did a wonderful job of portraying harry in the prisoners of azkaban. All in all, this movie is by far the best installment in the series yet, the actors have gotten down the parts of their characters very well, while there still is room for improvement, the job they have done in this movie is excellent. I hope that the rest of the movies improve upon the awesomeness of the prisoners of azkaban. Which is looking to be i an fairly bright like right now, there's no more to complain about. They have it down and are ready to grow along with the characters."
1616,,"Great Movie, best yet","Well, I watched the film last night. If I were to describe it in a word or perhaps two, they would be ""Scrappily Random"". Granted, the first may not be an actual word... but I think it fits the bill quite merrily."
1617,2,I say... what?,"Of the three HP movies, this has become my favorite. The very first time I saw it, there were things I missed from the book, of course, but these had faded into insignificance by the time I saw it the second time, the next day, and I could appreciate this movie for the truly artistic piece of work that it is. The hallmark of a great movie, for me, is it's ability to encapture me no matter how many times I see it, and this movie does exactly that. Director Alphonso Curan has completely captured the spirit of the books without necessarily replicating every little detail. The only disappointment that carried over past my first viewing was that the Marauder's Map and the significance of who wrote it was left unexplained for those who have not read the books (like my father). I'm looking forward to the movie's release on DVD already!"
1618,10,Terrific movie,"I saw the movie ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" at the movie theater the day that it first opened. I really enjoyed this movie except for the fact that there was a lot of the story left out of the movie. I know this because I actually read the book. An extra 30 minutes in the movie would have allowed some more of the story to be told. I hope that when this movie is released on DVD, these missing scenes will appear as an extra on the DVD."
1619,9,"I loved this movie, but...",Even with the attention to detail of a ridiculous fan and the love of the Harry Potter books the third film in this series should not in any way disappoint.
1620,,Third installment grows and darkens with the characters,"Spoiler alert The third installment in the book series-turned movie franchise was all around was excellent. Staying true to Rowling's mood in the third book, the movie is darker, scarier and has more complexity than the first two, which shows that the story is moving forward, that we are not just having a simple story of a boy wizard going through school at Hogwart's. "
1621,,Harry Potter...Kepp'em Coming!,"As the Harry Potter books got longer I wondered how they were going to be able to transfer all of them to film. This third film starts to show us how, and to book fans it's a little painful to watch."
1622,4,Disappointment to Book Fans,"I saw the first two Harry Potter movies before I began reading the books (I know -- pretty lame, but oh, well!). Thank goodness I'd read Books 1, 2, 3 and 4 before seeing this movie! Out of the first 4 books, Book 3 was my favorite and I was so looking forward to the movie. Although the acting continues to improve and it is clear that these three have developed real friendships, not just screen friendships, I so wish that the screenwriter had chosen to stay more true to the book and not put in unnecessary changes."
1623,,"Great cinematography, disappointing plot","This is by far the best Harry Potter yet. Alfonso Cuaron has an amazing vision. The screenplay writing is ten times better than the previous 2 films. They left out much of the book but kept in what was central to the plot. Visually, the film flows & Cuaron does a great job of keeping the story moving along without skipping a beat. "
1624,10,Amazing!,"Overall: brilliant, beautiful."
1625,,Beautiful,Harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban is a great movie! It's my favorite book out of the series and i think Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton) and Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe)are really hot!! I thought they producers did a really great job but they kind of rushed the movie. It could have been better if they slowed down abit and made the movie longer. But other than that i thought the movie was really well. I also noticed that the actors have gotten better at acting and i thought that made the movie better than the rest. Also i like that in the movies they are older than they r supposed to be in the books. So all together the movie was BRILLIANT!! and the actors are really good looking except Tom and Daniel they aren't good looking they are HOT!! lol
1626,10,Great!,"I just give a short statement here. Having seen the first two movies, although not a Harry Potter reader, I went to see this movie because I expected it to be something like a linear extension of the whole thing. I haven't read the books because A) I don't have the time and B) I prefer other types of books, but strange for me, I did like the first two movies. Why? Because they take you away into another world for two hours and give you a nice, fairy tale like story that is easy going and very nice for the eye. Chris Columbus was a great director for this kind of movies. I own both on DVD and sometimes when I want to relax, I throw them in, lean back and eat some candies."
1627,,Worse than the first two,"Time travel, the way it was presented in this movie, is completely impossible for the following reasons : Time is not a dimension, if anything, it's more of a ribbon. "
1628,,Time Travel Trimpossible !,"To me it was unfortunate that Richard Harris passed away and had to be replaced. I did not like how they changed Dumbledores personality, since they did that I was pleased he was not in the movie much. I also didn't like how they changed the scenery of the film compared to the other films. They put cliffs and rocky terrain in the 3rd movie where there wasn't in the other two. All in all it was a great film and story except for the things I listed above. I look forward to seeing Harry Potter and the Goblits of fire next year which I am currently reading and I believe will be the best so far. I do hope they take in consideration the changes they made and realize they were significant changes and in a sense changed the whole movie. It was also a mistake I think to have waited so long to make this film, the children are growing up and pretty soon they wont be looking like children in school any longer."
1629,,"Pretty good movie, some disappointments though","I just got back from seeing Harry Potter and the POA and I am UTTERLY MAD. The movie didn't do the book justice by a long shot! I think that that Alfonzo guy did a half asked job on the movie. I mean, it didn't follow the book worth crap! I mean common- if a movie is made after a book it should follow it pretty well - look at SS and COS. It skipped 4 chapters in the beginning and left out some major parts in the end. Not to mention all the foreshadowing that was supposed to be done that wasn't. And the set and Hogwarts grounds were completely different. Ugh it just all around ticked me off. And they should have done a butt load of coaching for Michael Gambon (the new Dumbledore). He didn't have the characteristics that were expected of Dumbledore. NOw for a TOTAL Harry Potter fan like me, this is like the apocalypse. WHY Didn't CHRIS COLOMBUS DO IT??? I thought that the actors were capable of a better job, so why didn't Alfonso give them that opportunity? AND WHERE DID THE TALKING HEAD COME FROM?"
1630,,UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT,"Okay. I was so excited to see this movie when it came out. I had my grandmother and my sister come with me because my best friends wouldn't come with me. This was the first book I read from the series and I loved the two movies. I was kind of upset that they didn't show more of the friendship of James, Sirius, Professor Lupin, and Peter and why it was so horrible that Harry's parents were betrayed. Also they didn't explain that map more. If I just watched the movie without reading the book I would been confused how Professor Lupin knew how to use it. Other wise the movie was amazing. The three actors have gotten so much better and continue to grow as actors. I nothing but respect for them. Ron is always funny and my favorite. I love how the director made this his own movie. Great job as a whole"
1631,8,The things left out.,"I absolutely loved this movie and I so want to see it again. The scenery was amazing, the Knight bus bit cracked me up, Buckbeak looked so real, the Dementors had a creepiness which was...um..creepy? The actors were really good as well. Rupert Grint did well as the confused Ron, Emma Watson was yet again perfect as brainy Hermione, Tom Felton was evilly good, though I hate his hair and Gary Oldman really shone as the murderer Sirius Black. But I have to say all major gratification goes to Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. Even though he's slightly older than his character, he still manages to express the emotion of a 13 year old. Harry also starts to develop a kind of moody side, like not being able to control his temper at times. I can relate to that in a different way, obviously coz I'm a girl! (He's also pretty fit, too!) On the whole, this movie was the best HP movie yet! Great job, Alfonso Cuaron!!"
1632,,Best Harry Potter Film Ever!,"Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his close wizard friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are starting their third year at Hogwarts. When the audience finds Harry he is at his Aunts home in England practicing magic and avoiding his ever watchful Uncle, when his Uncles sister arrives and sends all into chaos. Obviously she has a great disliking of Harry as she continually insults him and his parents. Harry, in an adolescent fit ends up blowing her up like a balloon and running away from the house. And now the turmoil begins as Harry starts to see spectres of the grim, as an escaped madman hunt him. As if this wasn't enough the ministry for magic has sent Dementors to guard the school (Hogwarts)."
1633,,Not the Harry I remember!!!,"This film in my point of view was not anywhere near as good as the first two. The director was different so i can understand the different ways of directing, but the entire set has changed, and so has everything in the castle. In the movie they wore ""muggle"" cloths most of the time, except for possibly two or three scenes, and Dan Radcliffe still does not have green eyes, which completely ruins no offense to dan the character harry potter who is supposed to have ""briliant green eyes"" and Dan has blue eyes."
1634,,It was okay.,"After waiting with baited breath for the release of my favorite book in the series (so far), I was, to put it bluntly, disappointed. This is such an excellent literary work, with so many subtle nuances, and subplot stories which add so much to the whole of the story. The movie in comparison was choppy and ill handled. In fact I believe this is the worst transition from book to film I believe I have ever seen. I know that a director has 'creative' license. But when that creativity adds to his goal of creating a flashy special effects show with no regard to the book then I would suggest that a director with a passion for the series (or at least someone who has read them http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190859/bio) is chosen."
1635,,Not impressed *SPOILER*,"Let me just say that i thought this movie was very good and entertaining. True it went by fast and left some things out but what you need to remember is that this is NOT the book it's a MOVIE. It's not going to be just like the book. That's why having the books is such a treasure because you have that extra bit of information and just ... more. Like i heard Stephen King say once ""Movies and Books are like apples and oranges, they are both delicious, but in many ways are different"" I've already seen it 3 times and tomorrow i'm going to see it again, and then next week with my grandmother. I have to say i LOVE this movie that much. I thought that the acting was wonderful by all the actors. And that Gary Oldman did a perfect job portraying Sirius. The new Dumbledore , i have to say, was nothing like the other one, but i don't think replacing what Richard Harris had done to the character was the plan. The new one did a good job making him his own Dumbledore, it's going to be hard to get used to him, and i think he needed to smile a bit more... but other than that he did well. I suggest anyone to see this movie ... HP fan or not, it's just that good of a movie. Better than the first two. Go HP!"
1636,,"""Bloody Brilliant""","I thought this was the best of the Harry Potter films so far. Quite possibly because I couldn't remember the little details in the book, and it had been years since I read it. The first two movies, although good, didn't seem quite like what I pictured. Because I had little preconceptions, I liked it more overall. I thought it was very easy to follow, and a cute movie. It's nice seeing the main actors older, and acting more like teenagers. Their non-uniform attire also makes it better, in my opinion. The effects were good, and beautiful backgrounds only added. Some construe it as darker than the others, and perhaps it is, but only a little. The characters are growing older, after all. It was a good movie, I really liked it, and I can't wait for the next one."
1637,8,The best of the Harry Potter films so far.,"I was finally able to see the new Harry Potter movie this past weekend and was amazed at how well the movie was made; the continued maturing of Harry, Ron and Hermiane. Seeing all the professors back, yes even Snape. I thought the role of the Divinity Instructor was cast and played very well. Kudos. The only thing I was truly disappointed in was the casting of Dumbledore. I felt the actor was a little too quick with the wit and humor."
1638,,Dumbledore,"This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It was one-hundred percent better than the first two. The only down was that the same Dumbledore wasn't there. You can tell. I wish Professor McGonagoll was in it more. She was only in a few sections of the movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone. There is a few intense parts of the movie that might scare little children. Professor Trawlorny was excellent. I just love here. I saw the movie three times and it was better and better each time. I can't wait till it comes out on video, so I can watch it over and over again. I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie. Again I give It a ten out of ten. Harry Potter Rocks Like Crazy!!!!"
1639,10,10 out of 10,"Harry Potter series has always been kind of solemn, not much jokes in the whole story. This time, it's different. With Alfonso Cuarón, it has a sense of comedy. There are also some touching part in the movie. You will be excited, amused and impressed. Ron and Malfoy become comedian this time. They are hilarious! I'm so glad that I've watched this movie in cinema, not at home(as I always do). It's really upsetting that Alfonso Cuarón is not going to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. He made the movie complete, with a sense of humor. Maybe it's due to the work of the Steven Kloves, I don't know. Anyway, it's brilliant. 10/10"
1640,10,Brilliant,"Although I still think the books are some of the greatest kids' literature in a generation, the direction taken by this movie has left me somewhat cold. It was brought to my attention in spades when I took my grandson to see the film."
1641,,**SPOILER** Something went wrong,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has virtually none of the good parts of the book. All of the stories are muddled up, and where is the quidditch game that Griffindor wins? How did the Weasley family afford a trip to Egypt? Why were Hermione and Ron not allowed in the pub, when they were all in there in the book? Peter Pettigrew was not on the maurauders map in the book, why was he there in the film? Weren't Hermione and Ron meant to have a huge fallout? Hermione wasn't meant to just appear in the classrooms! And Sirius was meant to explain all about the secret keeper and how he fought Peter. All together a film that, any one who has read the book will agree, doesn't follow the book at all."
1642,,Realistic viewpoints,"I've seen all three of the films produced so far and have read all of the novels out in print so I think I am qualified to say that the new movie is sadly lacking from the first two in depth of character and explanations. Until this film the studio had been careful to include all the scenes in the book producing a faithful representation of the novel as JK Rowling envisioned it. Much as the makers of the LoTR trilogy was painstakingly careful to produce a COMPLETE telling of the novels. In my opinion it was this change in format that led to the films being so very believable, emotional, enveloping, and ultimately popular. "
1643,,A shallow representation of the novel,"This movie was somewhat disappointing because it did not follow the book closely enough. The movie did not seem to stress enough Harry's fear of the big dog following him. Dementors do not fly, they float. Malfoy and gang appeared to Harry as dementors and this was not shown.. Snape regularly gives Lupin a potion for his peculiar affliction and this was not mentioned. There were many other omissions and it is my opinion that these omissions did not serve that movie well. Some of the things which were left out are going to be crucial to the next installments. I think the director made the movies banking on the fact that many people have already read the books. I know the books are getting longer but I also think that the writers of the film need to read the next installment to ascertain what they should emphasize in the current movie."
1644,,I was a little disappointed,"Like so many others I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books. It is a totally different story when it comes to the movies. For example I've never seen worse acting in a series of movies before. Yeah I can understand that it is hard to find good 12-year-old actors, but I want to puke every time I see Daniel Radcliffe try and throw out a punch line. In the first two films it was a treat to see one real actor in Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, but their replacement is a different story. Maybe I am being too hard on these sad movies because the books were so good, but could they have done no better? Maybe they couldn't afford any better, I mean how much has the three films grossed? Only 2.5 Billion? (Joking) I give this movie a generous 6."
1645,6,"RATED 7.7? How is this Possible, These movies are horrible!","I'm sure glad I ran across all the other negative reviews for this movie on your website....if you listen to the professional reviewers you'd think this movie was the best thing since coca cola.....if you truly are a Harry Potter fan, you know this movie was not done properly and what a shame....Mr. Gambone turned my favorite of the Harry Potter books into my least favorite of the movie versions. There was so much I was looking forward to seeing on the screen that I nearly cried when I saw the opportunities that were wasted. I hope JK puts her foot down or takes more control over book fours production. I really don't want to be disappointed yet again. I realize that Harry needs to become a more grown-up, darker character....but that happens by grace of the story line.....and it was happening, on its own."
1646,,What a disappointment,"The movie stank. It was not in line with the first two. The sets changed, the location looks totally different. All those little details in 1 and 2 that made for a common look and feel element to the movie (the book always attempted for the same feel when you read it) are lost. The director can't have read the book or had his kids there to make the movie honest otherwise they would have burned dad at the stake for blatant mistakes. I won't say that the director could not have done a great job but they obviously let em have 2 many liberties. What's the frakin deal anyway. I mean just study the fricking first two movies, work the same magic, keep things as similar as possible for the feel and it would have been a hit. Who the heck approved this piece, it wrecked the whole series. So much left out, so much out of order, no details with even a remote similarity. You would think the author would have had a shi% storm once she saw it. Do us all a favor and re-do this one with the original formula in tact. We don't care what it costs just do it right! Yes, we would pay to see it done right and I think that all the viewers of the first two would agree to that. Let's keep the movies on par with the book. It's damn stu&1d to put out such great book work and then two brilliant movies only to allow a #3 to be so bad. Heck I was looking forward someday to buying the entire movie collection but with #3 out there I feel it would be a waste of good money. I could rip this third movies up on details after detail either gotten wrong or left out or out of sequence but whats the point. Overall they did it wrong and they need to get back and do it over again. Oh BTW, the new Dumbeldore needs talk slower and more to the point, he never rattled off his dialog like the new guys doing. If I were Harry I'd hide under a rock an pray that they fire the new director or set him straight, whatever it takes to remake it. It wasn't bad it just wasn't in line with the book."
1647,,Aw common people......,"this movie was the very best potter movie. it beat the crap out of the first two. don't get me wrong, i like the first two, but after seeing the third film, which was so full of emotion, it made the other two look completely dull."
1648,,Best Movie Ever Seen,"Watching this installment was a roller-coaster ride in 2 ways: the quality of the various aspects e.g. acting, writing, balance (what got included / what was edited out) etc. was uneven; but the film itself was also an emotional roller-coaster ride. "
1649,,A Roller-coaster Ride,"I watched the movie first and thought it was brilliant. Then i read the books. I still think the movies are brilliant, but not quite as good as the books."
1650,,not as good as the book,"Hello, I am great fan of Harry Potter. I have read all the Harry Potter books and seen all the three movies. I was very glad when I first listen that Harry potter is filming. I waited for that very much. And my waiting was successful when I saw the first 2 movies of Harry potter. So, I waiting much more curiously for the 3rd part of Harry potter movie. But what I have seen in this movie? Before understanding the movie it was completed. What is this movie? It is not familiar with the first two. Alfonso Cuarón was failed to reach the inside of Harry potter. The facts were not related with each other. There were some extra facts on the movie but some important facts that were written in the book were totally absent. The campus of Hogwarts also not so good. It is very small and crowded. The previous one was very good. What type of quidch match is this? Alfonso Cuarón missed some important character too. And another failure was Dumbledore.He was very young as a headmaster of such an academy. His voice is not much good. I was very sad to see the movie. It was failed to satisfy me and all the children who were great fan of Harry potter. Now the 4th part is filming. Another new director has came, Mike Newell. I do not know whether he be success or not. Please bring Chris Columbus back as he has experience to make first two part of Harry potter. Chris Columbus is successful to those movies. He knows all about Harry potter. So, for the 5th part please bring him."
1651,,What is this movie?,I was disappointed in the movie because they left out an important part
1652,,good but disappointing,"i enjoyed the movie greatly. I don't have many complaints about the movie. The only thing i didn't like about the movie was how the whomping willow was in a different location as was hagrids house. Also the movie could have included who moony,wormtail,padfoot and prongs were and how lupin new how to open the map etc. But besides that i thought the movie was awesome! harry,ron and hermione were amazing. Although the new dumbledore could act a bit more mysteriouse and enchanting since he is a very powerful amazing wizard. I cant wait until harry potter and the goblet of fire. I think it will be an amazing addition to the 3 harry potter movies and just as good and hopefully better. Cant wait to see it!"
1653,,pretty good,"We all enjoyed the books, right? Are they exclusively children's books? NO. The first two Harry Potter movies are simplistic, uninspired, bland, yet enjoyable adaptations of the books, and they are evidently aimed squarely at kids, in this they differ from their counterparts. "
1654,9,First inspired Harry Potter movie,What was the director thinking! This film was so bad i was so disappointed when i went to see the 3rd movie i fell to sleep. The book was so good it was my second favorite book and the movie was so horrible. Everything was so different and they didn't even show everything in the book. There were so many parts i wanted to see in the movie and didn't get to see that i was mad. If you watch the movie it doesn't explain everything so you get confused if you didn't read the book. I wanted to see more of the things that Harry did with the Marauders Map and all the things that Sirius and Harry went through. This director is suppose to be directing part 4 and that is going to be another disappointment for all TRUE Harry Potter fans. The old director was so much better because he showed every important detail and he didn't change anything around.
1655,,This film was a disappointment,"Being an avid fan of the Harry Potter series, I was delighted to hear that Columbus was being replaced. I wanted a darker, mature Harry Potter. So I went to see the movie as soon as possible."
1656,,Artistic License?,"when i first hear anything of Harry Potter, i didn't like it. I only watched the first and the second movie, because my father wanted it. then I go to cinema to watch the third one. I thought before i saw it ""oh it will be OK"" but than i saw it, and it was fantastic. The Story was brilliant, the actors were great. it was all so fantastic, i watched the movie again and again. I would do it anytime again. When i went out of the cinema i can't think about anything else, i only can think about this movie."
1657,10,a wonderful movie,"OK, I loved this movie better than the other two films, but I also hated it. When i watch the film and just watch the film without trying to analyze whats happening I think it is amazing. But, when I compare it to the book and see all of the crucial information that was left out, I really don't like it. I mean, the least they could do was explain what and who moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs were. And also why Harry's patronus took the form that it did. But no, that would just be silly to have people actually understand the movie. OK, sorry, I got a little off track."
1658,,Love it/Hate It,"I think it's really necessary that you've seen the previous Harry Potter - Movies to like this one. I did not - and during the whole film I had the feeling that this Movie was full of allusions and references to Harry Potter Part 1 and 2. Frequently there were scenes in the cinema, when the complete audience (the average age was something between 13 and 16 years, many of them ""Potter-fans"") was laughing and screaming. The complete audience - except of me. Am I to old (22) for such kind of movie? Am I to serious? If yes, why do I like ""Lord of the rings"" and other fantasy stuff that much? So better read the book(s) or watch the previous movies to enjoy this one."
1659,5,You need background-information to enjoy this movie,I think Harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban (the latest installment of the Harry Potter trilogy if you will) Is if nothing more a refreshing change for older audiences which makes sense considering that the actors are getting older along with the whole concept.
1660,,A refreshing yet not altogether welcome change.,"The new director was horrible. Not even comparable to Chris Columbus. He changed the entire format of the school, Hagrid's hut was in a completely new place!!?? He left out a lot of important parts. For example, why was there a deer next to harry across the lake, he didn't mention that and yet he still put the deer in the movie. I am very glad there will be a new director for the 4th installment. The actors did a great job in this movie though. The end freeze frame was also very lame and cheesy. He tried too hard to focus on being comical than being true to the book. I understand that it is a long book and you have to cut things out but he cut out too many important things in place of not so important things. He also left out the whole cute story about how his dad was one of the guys that made that map he was using, just things like that which made book so good and heart warming."
1661,6,Bad Director,"I have seen Harry potter, The prisoner of Azaban three times and I found it so much more fascinating than the the first two movies. I love the camera shots and music that gave it awesome atmosphere to the movie. I was impressed to hear that two New Zealander's took part in the making of the move. Percy and Professer Lupin who was on Lord of the Rings as Faramir. I cannot wait for the next movie. The main actors must be finding it hard to grow up on film and I was impressed with their acting ability in the third film. I am worried that the main actors are to old to be playing their characters as they are so much older and it is starting to show.Especially with Rupert who plays Ron and the Weasley twins. It took half the film for me to figure out who the twins were. With the change of hair and everything. I am sure with the process of make up today for movies, it will work out that problem. But with movies everyone is to their own and I am sure there will be people who will disagree with me and think that the movies are ruining the books.I am a proud fan of Harry potter, and love the books and the movies."
1662,,"I extremely pleased with the movies, harry potter.","Hi all Harry Potter fans, I would firstly like to say that this is by far the best film. But I must note that this is not due to the new director it is because that the book was better than the first and second. I agree with many of the other comments that there were many parts of the book that were failed to be shown in the film. For instance it failed to show that there was a lot of speculation that the Firbolt was sent by Sirus Black. In the book there was a large argument between Hermoine&Ron and this was lost in he book. Which I believe was due to the fact that the film makers want it ti be like a Disney movie happy throughout. I think that the film makers need to include these parts as it will make us care about the characters a lot more.I think anyone who watches the film and doesn't read the books misses out on caring about the characters. I do hope the next book is created well and that the happy and sad parts are all included."
1663,,A good film,"Sadly I must confess that the newest Potter film was a great disappointment. I expected a lot, especially having read all the praising reviews. I found the film far too incoherent and fragmentary. If I hadn't read the book previously, I would have been totally lost with the ""storyline"" as the film just sort of jumped from one sequence to another. Not even the highly praised dementours impressed me that much--I expected more and was---disappointed. The book is much better--as it often is the case. As for the actors, the main characters did a pretty good job. Professor Dumbledore, again, was a far cry from his previous self--had the ending been more like in the book, his true character would have been more evident. Maybe the movie would have been better, if it had been a bit longer. In contrast to Spiderman 2--this movie didn't seem TOOO long but managed to hold its grip--even of a critical viewer."
1664,,incoherent,"I was really disappointed w/the third movie. The new director really screwed up some key things. I hated the fact that he changed the scenery. I hated how he left things out and rearranged the storyline. From what I heard about the film, the director was trying to make this installment more ""real"" and a little darker than the previous two movies. He wanted to show that the kids were growing up. That's fine. However, these stories aren't based on anything ""real"". They're fantasy. I liked the magical quality of the first two movies. I liked seeing all the neat magical gadgets that I'd read about in the books. And I definitely appreciated the first director's efforts to stick to the books as much as possible. All the little details that make Harry Potter so special were totally discarded for the third movie. If I was JK Rowling, I would never have approved this screenplay. When the third book is longer than both of the first two, and the third movie is NOT as long as either of the first two movies, that is a dead giveaway that the story has been totally cut up and screwed up. VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED! I hope that the next director will do a better job w/#4."
1665,6,disappointed,"this film was by the far the best so far. they will have to work very hard to out do this one. i was very impressed with this film as i'm sure i will be with the rest of them. i am patiently waiting as is everyone else to see the next movie. the books have also been something that i cannot get enough of. i find myself not being able to put the books down one i start to read them. i hope that every other Harry Potter fan feels the same way that I do. And if you haven't tried it yet I truly recommend that you try the Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban pc/cd rom game. it is very entertaining and follows along with the movie well. its a great experience. I'm sure that if you do not love it, if you have kids then they will. share the fun. cast a few spells and have a good night."
1666,10,"Thank you, I'm a great movie lover","I agree with the people that said the they were disappointed with the directing, the special effects were great, but they flipped too many things around; like Hagrid's cabin and the whopping willow were totally different place (also the tree looked nothing like it did in the 2nd movie). What was it with Harry doing magic during the vacations, that totally contradicts what Harry had to go through because he did magic in the 5th book. I really wasn't happy with the Dumbledor, i mean, why didn't they just make him look the same as before, with a different person playing the roll. I was really unhappy with this movie and i just hope the put a bit more effort into the movie following the what the book says instead of trying to make it shorter. i would much rather see a good movie about a great book i read then a movie that has a couple of reference to the book. the 4th book is my favorites book and i hope i'm not disappointed when i go to see it."
1667,,"Didn't like it, hope that next ones are better","okay....I'm going to quote my cousin on this movie...""It's really good, but it sucked compared to the books."" It moved way to fast, all of a sudden it was Christmas, then it was the last day..if it would have been longer they could have added more of the better points...and the animation wasn't that good, and the grounds were different than in the first two movies, the terrain was way different, and it should have stayed the same. Personally I think the movie should be re-made with the previous director Christopher Columbus. I liked the way he directed the movies. I think the main thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that it went to fast, Hermione didn't have time to be smart, and Harry didn't get his broom until at the end. But I think the acting got a lot better, especially Daniel and Tom's acting....I liked their acting way better than in the previous movies, but thats because they have had more experience two."
1668,7,This is just my opinion....you think what you want,"To answer your question, he appears as that because a true patronus takes the shape of something that truly protects you. That is the animal that Harry's dad transformed into (all 4 of the friends were animagus) Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and liked the new director much better than the other one, though he was good too."
1669,10,Question answer and summary,"O.K. here's my beef, I saw the first movie (with low expectations I might add), then the second movie... then I read the books. The first movie and the second movie adhered masterfully to the books, which is how it should be with such superior literature. Needless to say I was incredibly anxious to see the new movie, and was disappointed in the extreme. This is the longest book of the bunch thus far (speaking chronologically as movies come out) and yet it's the shortest movie. Whole large chunks of the story have been left out, scenes are not in the same order as in the book, and all in all I was left wondering how something that started so well fell so far down hill. I understand that there is a new director for this one, and in that case I would seriously suggest not using him again and sticking with the original or at least someone who respects the written version as much as his vision of it. Also, I have to give kudos to the whole cast. While the story itself was chopped up and butchered in comparison to previous two movies, the actors all portrayed their characters to perfection, giving glimpses of the personalities that would have been clearer had the movie been done appropriately. And lastly; our new Dumbledore gives a great performance, while I respect the others work and applaud it, he is now more like the literature version of the character with his jokes, smiles and twinkling eyes."
1670,,What happened????,I think that Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban is a great movie. I just watched it.It's the best one from all the Harry Potters I have
1671,10,Don't miss!!!,"I too resisted reading these books due to the fact that they were books my 10 yr old was reading and it didn't seem like my thing. Of course when the first movie came out I took her to see it to be a good mommy. I actually really enjoyed it and later bought it when it was released. Then the 2nd movie came out and of course we went to see it together. Harry Potter became a good mommy/daughter thing to do. After seeing the 2nd movie (of which I loved) I decided I'd better read the books so that I could stay up with what was going on. I read all 5 consecutivly like they were one book. Though I loved them all, Goblet of Fire is my favorite. "
1672,,You people who rated P of A a 10 are on drugs!!!,"I loved the title because it had to do a lot with the movie. I think that this movie is too scary for young children, but still I loved it very much. I think that if you make it less scary, everyone can watch this movie without worrying in having nightmares. I, personally, loved this movie and have seen it lots of times, because it has comedy, drama, action, adventure, horror, and lots of things of science fiction mixed up. I also loved the way that all these genres were mixed up to form this unique movie of wizards and witches. I also liked the title because I really thought that the bad guy had really been locked up in the Azkaban Prison. It didn't even occurred to me that the bad guy was Ron's rat."
1673,,"I think that this movie is too scary for very young children, but still I loved it very much.",The credits do not do it justice. I enjoyed it so much on the big screen. I had seen the first two on video only. In the theatre was awesome. Very touching and moving film. I have read all the books and was very pleased with how well the story was adapted to the big screen. As an adult viewer I had my doubts if a new director was the answer and am very happy my fears were put to rest. POA is awesome and definitely different from the first two films. The book is also different from the previous two books. I want to see it again. And I also plan to add the VHS tape to my collection. This is a must see film for anyone who enjoys fantasy and larger than life storytelling!!
