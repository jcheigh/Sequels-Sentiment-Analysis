0,,Slow First Half Picks Up in Finale,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) 
1,9,Playtimes over,Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.
2,8,"Separate the film from the book, and you will be impressed","I actually was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview on Monday. The ""experience"" was lousy, but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book, you won't be disappointed."
3,6,"My Least Favorite Up To This Point, Maybe Overall","With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts."
4,4,Order of the Plot-Holes,"For those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, this film isn't it. How director David Yates got the go to direct completely baffles me. Not since Chris Columbus' stilted pacing has a HP film disappointed me. I realize that in a book as rich in detail as the HP series something is bound to be left out in the film version, but the direction and editing of this film leave much to be desired."
5,10,Order of the Phoenix is about the Real World,"Why do Harry Potter movies give me, but not the children, nightmares? I've been wondering this for the past few years. Today, watching Movie No. 5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Warner Bros., 2007), I got my answer. Simply: Harry's world is the real world. As Harry and his friends mature, the line between the world of wizardry, magic, and Hogwarts and the world of self-centered, manipulative, cruel adults thins to the point of almost magical invisibility."
6,10,"Best out of the five, but if you are only going to focus on the plot problems, don't bother because your whining will only give the rest of us headaches...",Longest Book. Shortest movie.
7,,Nothing Up My Sleeve,There were previous editions of the franchise that I liked. One had a real rhythm; another leveraged architecture in a truly competent way.
8,7,"A great movie, yet completely surpassed by the book","When I first walked into the movie, my expectations were not very high. The first two movies, I thought, were the best of the series mainly due to Richard Harris' dead-on portrayal of Dumbledore and screenplays that closely followed the original books. Though the third and fourth movies were very artistic and dramatic, I couldn't really connect to them in the way i had with the books. They glossed over many of the little things that made the Harry Potter series so magical in the first place, focusing on a select few plot lines and limiting dialog to only what was necessary to further the story. "
9,10,Simply Put...Phenomenal (A Book-Reader's Review),"OK. Yes stuff was left out. Yes some things were inaccurate. And yes, at times the story jumped around. But I'll tell you what, if that's the price to pay for being able to see fantastic literature on the big-screen...I'll take a few inconsistencies any day."
10,4,Everything is going downhill,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter movie directed by David Yates. Some fans love Yates and his different style, but there are people who don't like him, myself included. Sure, he's the one responsible for my favourite half of the series, where Harry is growing up and everything is darker. But in the movies the characters aren't as deep and the darkness feels more like a colour scheme than a change in the story telling."
11,8,"Slow story, but ends with the highest high of the series.","For the first time in the series, HP and his friends are left to their own devices due to the bureaucratic takeover of Hogwarts. Slow plot development aside, this movie culminates in the breathtaking and visually stunning duel between Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort."
12,9,"JK's biggest book to the screen, mission impossible? Mission accomplished!!!","For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word ""how"". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta."
13,1,Who ruined Harry Potter?,"I have read and enjoyed all 7 Harry potter novels, and I watched and enjoyed the first 2 films, Azkaban and GOF were OK but not good. This however was awful, and when I say awful I really mean awful. I was genuinely on the verge of walking out of the theatre after about 30 minutes, the only reason I sat through this was because of my wife."
14,8,"Excellent, the magic is still alive","Well, the magic is back and its stronger than ever. By far this is the best Harry Potter movie of the series, it has everything, humor, action and adventure, suspense and mystery and some moments of drama too. A film that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Its story is excellent, the first part is kinda slow but it gets better when it came the time to fight for Harry Potter and all his friends, the plot convince me to the fullest and with a great adaptation from the book, there's some parts from the same book that doesn't appear on the film, but its comprehensible because they do it that way so that the movie won't lose rhythm and turn boring to watch. Everyone from the cast gives excellent performances, specially Daniel Radcliffe and Ralph Fiennes as Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort respectively, Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter all three are excellent in their roles that gives the necessary support to the leading ones, just one complaint, I expected to see more of Cho Chang I think that her participation was to short. The direction of David Yates is simply wonderful he gives the movie a dark enjoyable vision and a good rhythm that never falls. The makeup is great specially on Lord Voldemort and the CG effects were just awesome. In conclusion this 5th Harry Potter movie was very entertaining for people of all ages and a must see for everyone."
15,2,Riddikulus,I feel cheated. I really do. Too much omitted this time.
16,4,"Tries hard, but lacks the charm of the other Potters","In some ways the film makers were on a hiding to nothing with Order of The Phoenix; it's the least interesting, most over-blown of Rowling's usually wonderful books, in which Harry spends most of his time skulking around and shouting at people. Discovering his father was a bit of a school bully doesn't help much, I suppose."
17,5,The Magic is Gone,"In Order of the Phoenix, David Yates gives us a bland spectacle that lacks any real magic or character development and features a disjointed storyline and over-the-top acting. I reasonably enjoyed the book, even though it was over long and nothing really happened, but I didn't really like the movie, and as I'll show you, most of that has nothing to do with the book."
18,4,We were so disappointed!,Our family waited for six hours to get in to see this film at the midnight showing and wish we had gotten a good night sleep instead! I am only grateful that we weren't stupid enough to wait until the 3:15 am showing in 3D! So much was missing from the film that it hardly made sense to the members of our family who have not read the book and those of us that have read it were upset about what was missing and angry about what had been shoved together.
19,1,Trashing J K Rowling --- Warner's $242 million Rip-Off!,"Any Harry Potter movie is a special event, so we chose Washington DC's finest movie theater, the UPTOWN, with its giant Cinerama curved screen and superior stereo, laid down our $8 per ticket, and expected the best."
20,6,"Humorous, But Hard To Follow If You Haven't Read The Book","If you scan the first hundred reviews of this movie on this website, I think you'll see the words ""disappointed"" and ""disappointment"" more than any other adjectives. I, too, found it the same. I have not read any of the books, but I've seen - and enjoyed - the four previous movies, so I expected to full enjoy this one."
21,8,Number 5 is pretty good as well,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth from 8 Harry Potter films. It is the first directed by David Yates. So far, directors switched quickly, but Yates continued and returned to the franchise for films 6, 7 and 8. The screenplay comes not from the guy who made it all the other movies based on Rowling's novels, but from the writer of ""Peter Pan"", Michael Goldenberg. This is one of 2 (I believe) Harry Potter films that did not score a single Academy Award nomination and were ""only"" honored by BAFTA."
22,10,Snivellus Snape gets what he deserves!,"Oh you can shake Snape up! Oh you anyone can shake Snape up! Like boob fat, shake shake Snape, shake shake Snape, shake shake! Oh I love this film so much!"
23,9,Loved it,"I have not yet read any of these books but find myself very much engaged in the films. That being said, im not the best judge to the faithfulness of movie to book. However, I can say this, I loved this film. In my opinion it did go with less of the magic, which really made you feel what the kids were going through. The pacing is very good, slow in some parts, but overall good. The performances are much better this time around and it has quite a few stand up and clap moments. It is much better written and directed than the previous efforts, although azkaban is still my favorite, this would have to be second. The ending felt a little rushed and I wish there was more voldemort, but these are very little gripes for a great film truly pushing the limitations of children's story. It really makes you drool for the next picture, especially if you do not read the books. I really hope harry becomes this amazing wizard like it keeps promising and the final battle is full fledged amazing. We will see. Anyway, it's a beautiful film with great performances and dazzling special effects. This one really steers toward an older crowd and I feel younger children might get bored with it, but not us older kids. I don't want to spoil this for everyone, so ill just sum it up by saying that I don't feel this series is losing steam, just gearing up for an amazing finale, and if this transitional film has anything to say about it, I can't wait to see where it goes."
24,2,"Too Short, Too Little, TOO LATE!",THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! CAUTION!!!
25,5,Slow Down!,"I love the Harry Potter books, and I've always liked the movies. That's why I was very excited to go see the latest installment of the series. However the movie did not at all live up to my expectations; to me it felt rushed and choppy. I realize that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a very long book, but so was The Goblet of Fire and I enjoyed it's movie adaptation a lot. In this movie seemed as though the director merely had a check list of scenes that he needed to but in the movie put no thought into connecting them. The speed and choppiness of the movie took away from the characters. It was just events and there was hardly any character development at all. Which was a shame because the young cast continues to get better, and there were some amazing acting veterans (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter etc.) In my opinion if the director had slowed everything down, only a little, he could've added a lot more (character development, humor, fluidity) However, despite by prier comments, the movie was not terrible. It did have it's good moments, but I think it could have been done a lot better."
26,8,The Order,The Order of the Phoenix is the first of the series from the best Director Harry Potter had (David Yates) and it shows. I'm going back and rewatching these all in sequential order and this one surprised me the most as it's a lot better and more enjoyable than I remember. The story line is fantastic. Harry and his crew train and gear up for what's to come. The Order is introduced and helps. And Voldemort and his side also start to gain power and momentum. We also get to see the Order fight Voldemort's minions AND Dumbledore fight Voldemort. This was an extremely fun and underrated movie in the series.
27,10,Stupefied!!! Three Words- Potter 5 is BEST,"I was very lucky, watched screening of this movie in IMAX 3-D yesterday night. I want to confess that I was not a die hard fan of Harry Potter films (but now I am). I have read the book, slightly disappointed due to plot editing. I want to share several points of this movie, so i'll start with bad ones."
28,1,Never been so disappointed in my life,"Yates, be ashamed. Goldenberg, be ashamed. This is the worst HP movie a die hard fan had to sit through. To start off, just because the movie is an adaptation of the book does not mean it should leave out entire story lines, change others, and expose only those that will glitter and impress those who have not read the book. Lord of the Rings... ring a bell, followers of the book... did it stray as much from the books as OOTP did? Now for serious talk, whoever decided that Grawp should look like a 20' middle-aged man with Down's Syndrome should be tortured for the rest of their life. Not only did Grawp look slow, but behaved, moved, and got the audience's sympathy NOT how the book describes him at all. And how about entire chunks of the book thrown away for a cheap (but likely profitable) movie? How about being 3/4 through the book in 60 minutes? How about Kreacher, 2 scenes? How about Sirius' mother's portrait? How about Quidditch? How about the Patronus charm being ""very advanced magic"" yet the director felt every character needed an animal? How about classes, wizard clothing, Diagon Alley... is Hogwart's set in London now for some reason? How about Harry is the only one that does lines in Umbridge's office (so as to isolate him further from his friends in his loneliness)? How about Firenze taking over Divination, showing that it is not a lost art and course? How about Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, the twins' decision making, the money Harry gave them to open up their shop? How about knowing the names of the escaped convicts, was it going to cost too much to PRINT 10 names of the villains who are in the finale on the Prophet? I realize this is a film ""based"" on the book, but to be able to say that the movie should reflect at least 50% of the book, if the craptacular disappointment duo of Yates/Goldenberg sign on for Half Blood Prince, I hope I am not alone in wishing them to buy a few extra letter openers for the ""angry"" mail they will certainly receive. If another duo appears, my advice is to stick to the book, even Mel Gibson did that..."
29,9,Amazing movie put forth by a stellar cast!,"Once again, I believe that the series is only getting better with each progressive movie. I attended a preview screening tonight and was completely blown away by the movie. While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie, how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said, Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book, and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried, I laughed, and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn't breathe from the tension."
30,10,Excellent and keeps your heart racing with excitement.!!!!,"Speaking as someone who has never read any of the books but has gotten more and more hooked on the whole Harry Potter mystic by reading up on it in on different websites, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix. Sometimes maybe its best if you haven't read the books before seeing the movie. I saw the Lord Of The Rings trilogy after having read the books many times and things were changed and things left out and I was a little critical myself but I still loved them.Lets face it if they wanted to stuff the amt of material the author wrote into one movie ,youd have to make two movies for each book. I've enjoyed each Harry Potter movie and eventually I will read the books to get the whole story but Id rather not do it yet since its so refreshing to not know what is going to happen going in.Its hard though with the net not getting spoilers everywhere so I will try not to followed the Deathly Hallows spoilers when the book comes out.Of course it will be 3 yrs before the final movie comes out. Now back to OOP - it was fantastic, the acting was good especially Dan Radcliffe ,such a range of expression and emotion on his face and the beautiful Emma Watson returns as a fierce Hermione. She really has punch. I loved the final battle at the end with the Death Eaters and of course Dumbledore vs Voldemort. It was sad seeing the fate of one of the main characters whom many fans have enjoyed. Hmm I wonder if that character will return in HBP or DH. All in all a grand time . I cant wait till HBP comes out next yr but we will have to wait until near Xmas time. And then 2 yrs after that what a wait that will be until DH comes out. See you at the movies.Cheers"
31,9,Perhaps a tiny slip in the so far increasingly brilliant series...but so far it's been absolutely breath taking,"I would not for a minute tell you that Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was not worth seeing or that as many critics have stated Harry Potter had ""lost it's magic,"" fact is Order Of The Phoenix continues and achieves what few else if any film series has ever carried out and that's the continuity of absolute epic brilliance. So far from the very first film this series has only gotten better and better with maturity and story and part of that is the brilliance of the author of the original stories (which I have not read yet and likely won't until the films are behind me.) J.K. Rowling is so involved in these films and insists on absolute authority on each character and what makes it in the film and certainly if anyone knows how to bring her amazing and epic story to life it would be her. Order Of The Phoenix I 'think' is the bridge between everything from Hogwarts in the beginning unraveling to lead up to the epic ending of this series. Being the bridge can't be easy and probably doesn't fulfill some of the previous installments glory but it's still very important and still has some incredible scenes including an absolutely breath taking battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore that is easily on the top ten list next to Vadar and Skywalker, or anything from Lord Of The Rings. It's simply stunning!! The film does start out a little slower than most and yet seems to rush through everything but I understand The Order of The Phoenix is a massive book (in fact the longest in the series---870 pages) and that alone is enough to understand why there might have been a struggle to jam everything into this film that they possibly could and I have no doubt they did a stellar job but it still might have seemed slightly rushed and maybe a little incomplete. One of the most amazing aspects of the films to this point has been the incredible ensemble cast which sadly and unfortunately (but perhaps necessarily) leaves them in the back seat (especially the teachers and professors and adult characters.) However we do get far more from the students, from Harry himself and his best friends are still on the forefront. It was just sad to not have the more adult characters around more (especially Hagrid.) "
32,8,"Not without its flaws, but highly entertaining.","After his fourth traumatic year at Hogwarts that ended with a showdown with the franchise's very own Mr Bad, Lord Voldemort, it doesn't seem too much for Harry Potter to be asking for a peaceful Summer. However, he doesn't get such a wish  from the opening scene in which Harry and his despised cousin Dudley have close encounters of the life-threatening kind with two dementors in an underground passage, it is clear that Voldemort has unfinished business with the scarred lad, and that he has every intention of finishing it. Plus, nearly everyone in Harry's school believe him to be a liar, Professor Dumbledore refuses to look him in the eye, his friends don't understand him, and, on top of that, Harry must grapple with the skills required in mastering his first kiss. My, my, aren't teenage lives complicated?!"
33,7,Another Entertaining Adventure,"After defending himself and Dudley Dursley with magic from an attack of the Dementors, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a hearing and found not guilty from the accusation of inappropriate use of magic in front of humans. Then he returns to Hogwarts and finds that most people do not believe that Voldemort is back. Further, the Ministry of Magic has assigned the annoying and despicable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to change the directions in the school affecting the lives of the teachers and mainly the students. She suspends the practical course of self-defense spells, and Harry Potter and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronnie (Rupert Grint) form a clandestine group to learn magic with Harry Potter. Meanwhile Harry Potter has horrible visions and nightmares and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) tells him that he is mentally connected to the Dark Lord, teaching him how to defend from an intrusion in his mind."
34,9,'Phoenix' May Be Best 'Potter' Yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 5th installment out of 7 in the story of Harry Potter. With the release of this film as well as the final literary installment of the series, 'Potter 'has received a great abundance of exposure (as if it needed it). In 'Phoenix', Harry and Dumbeldore are targeted by the Ministry of Magic after claiming (correctly) that the dark Lord Voldemort has been reborn. A sadistic member of the Ministry is installed in Hogwarts who slowly takes over the entire school. Meanwhile, a secret organization, the Order of the Phoenix, recruits Harry, and prepares for the Dark Lord's return. As the story gets darker, the films get better. This film (while it was not the best book in the series), is quite possibly the 'Potter' film yet. The teenage as well as adult cast excel while visuals and special effects are nothing less than top notch. While the film did do a good job making a page 896 book into a 2 hour and 15 minute movie, I do wish that it could have been longer to include more details and sub-plots which were cut either in post production or during the writing process. The explosive finale is incredible and will cast a spell on you throughout. 'Phoenix' is a must see for any 'Potter' fan, while others will still find it an enjoyable ride."
35,7,Haphazard film-making makes for a rather disappointing fifth part of the series,"Even though I am only a moderate fan of the books (meaning I have yet to finish the last book, despite having it since the day it came out), I usually look at the release of a new Harry Potter as something to get excited about. Even though the quality is not always spot-on, there is just something about them that allows them to feel wondrous and fantastical all at once. And even with their numerous problems (albeit, not as bad as those associated with The Lord of the Rings trilogy), they still end up being rather enjoyable. Sadly, I think the quality has really begun to slip, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the first film since Philosopher's Stone that actually disappointed me as a film-goer and reader of the books."
36,2,Over hyped rubbish... I'm going to watch paint dry...,"Well I just saw OotP, and the only actors I would keep would be Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham-Carter, Gary Oldman, George Harris, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Alan Rickman."
37,9,A Great Transition From Book to Film!,"Whenever I watched this movie for the first time years ago, I was very skeptical as to how this movie would play out, considering they are cramming an 800 page book into less than two-and-a-half hours. Nevertheless, somehow, someway, they managed to succeed in what they were doing, and made (in my opinion) the best film in the series yet. I like better than the previous four films because the stakes were a lot higher and it just felt grander and everything that happened felt like it happened for a reason. I really just think that everything was improved since the last film. Overall, they somehow managed to make an enjoyable film out of an 800 page book, without having a massive runtime of like three hours."
38,10,Well worth the wait...AMAZING!!!,"I, like millions of other people, am a hard-core Harry Potter fan. After seeing the Fourth movie (which, in my opinion, was the weakest yet) I was a bit optimistic when I stepped foot into the private screening for this film. I feared that it was follow the steps of it's proceeder. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!! Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is absolutely amazing! Filled with eye-popping special effects, great acting (Daniel captured Harry's feelings and emotions with pitch perfect accuracy) a great cast, and wonderful cinematography! This film has a Prisoner of Azkaban feel to it, but is MUCH darker."
39,9,Probably my favourite of the bunch,"Though I perceive the whole series pretty much as a single entity to be binged completely or not watched at all, when I think about an order of preference this movie is definitely up there contending for the first place. The reason is Umbridge. Though while binging I kind of dread her arrival, she is a character I just love to hate. As pointed out many times already, she is a sort of villain, many of us have met and will meet in our lives which makes her all the more real, the story more personal. Add on top of that Sirius personal consequences and a killer third act that IMO superseeds any of the later movies and this might just be my favourite. FYI the next in line would be the first movie, which though has its problems, the nostalgia is just heavy. It (the first one) captured how I imagined the books pretty much exactly."
40,6,"A ""Cliff Notes"" version of the book","I've been eagerly awaiting this episode, thinking it was going to be much more action-packed or incorporating some of the more juicy bits of narrative from the over-800 page book. I ought to have known going in that, at 2:18 running time, the movie was too short. Even considering the tweaking that needed to be done to incorporate information differently than the book presents it (like by-passing the house elves storyline), at least a half-hour more could've been left in to really build up the story. The scenes we do see are well acted, there are obvious clues alluding to the final installment, and the special effects are dazzling. But one leaves the theater breathless and disoriented as if one ate a rich meal too quickly. Especially exasperating considering we had to sit through 20 minutes of TV commercials and coming attractions--I would've paid extra to see another 20 minutes of movie instead."
41,2,A Huge Disappointment,"When I first saw the previews for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I was giddy because i actually thought that OOTP would be magical, amazing, and action-packed. How ignorant i was. Now i know it is a 870 page book but if a fantasy movie based on a book is going to be done right, it calls for a longer movie or the possibility of doing a part two. Trying to cram all this information in two hours makes the audience member feel incredibly stuffed and congested. The cameras were too fast, actors spoke their lines too fast. Probably the greatest example is the scene where Severus gets his pants pulled down by James. A great scene in the book but turned into five seconds of incoherence in the movie. Uncle Vernon is a yeller, plain and simple. He did not shout once in OOTP. And when did Dudley become a gangster? Why did Flitwick, who looked normal in the first two films, become a guy with black hair and moustache? That's not Flitwick and his arm pump is not something he would do (although i must admit it was hilarious). George and Fred deserved a bigger finish. Sure the fireworks were OK, but in the book how the were cornered and they grab their brooms, talk to peeves, and escape. That was a finish. Now i understand that the films are becoming darker and more sinister and stuff. And because they're so creative, they make the set and the movie more visually darker to convey this metaphor. However, as an audience member, i want to see the faces of the actors and set. Having the centaur scene with no lines and unable to see things clearly makes it look disorientated and confusing. Actors and actresses that make a grand appearance in the book would get more time in the movie. If i didn't read the books and saw Tonks doing her pig and duck thing i would seriously be like ""WTF?"" Seriously, people who are not die-hard fans need to be explained things. You would think they would explain the prophecy a bit better with Neville and all, but no they couldn't take the time to do that. They just made silly mistakes. Poking a dementor in the eye when it is choking you? Seriously now. And what happened to Quidditch? It was action packed and amazing in the first two films, but yet again, they succeeded in taking away the magic that made the first two films fabulous. I believed the final battle would be breath-taking but was I robbed on that notion. Like the movie, the prophecy room was tight and overcrowded. No brain room? And it wasn't avada kedarva that killed sirius. However, i grow tired of complaining about this movie. Hopefully people will just read the book instead, which unlike the movie, is good."
42,10,A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Finally, Harry Potter's gotten a decent clean cut hairstyle, compared to that ghastly shaggy dog manes that he spotted in the previous installment Goblet of Fire. The much touted scene here is The Kiss (about 1 hour into the movie), but seriously, that's much ado about nothing compared to what the rest of the movie has in store for audiences around the world. Just so you know, I've still not read any of the books by JK Rowling thus far, preferring to rely on cinematic magic to condense the ever increasing thickness of the novels into 2hrs and 10-20mins of full sensory invasion."
43,1,Utterly dreadful compared to the books,"Book 5 is my favorite out of the entire Harry Potter series. It's roaringly funny, has great interactions between all the characters, has a highly interesting plot, and of course, the Quidditch matches you can't help but care about. The movie somehow manages to take all of that energy, humor, and magic and make one of the most disorganized, uninteresting, and boring films I have ever seen. The screenwriters and Daniel Yates should be embarrassed over how bad this was. Stilted doesn't begin to describe the script. Where are the jokes? The fun exchanges between the characters? Where is the drama of teenagers struggling to navigate a deteriorating situation? Why do the actors spend far more time staring at each other and mumbling their lines instead of actively engaging with each other? Why are so many important plots stripped from the screen?"
44,3,"If your head spins when you see HP 5, don't worry, it's not just you.","To be honest I didn't have very high hopes for this film. However, that kind of situation can usually allow for one to be impressed. This, however, was not the case."
45,2,Yet again the movie disappointed me,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix surpassed even my lowest expectations for the film. The movies have been steadily declining since the third movie. It's not that they're bad just standing alone, but as they are based on the phenomenal books by J K Rowling they should at least try to stick somewhat close to them. This however almost never happens, it's as though the director just wants to make his film and get his money, it doesn't do the books justice in the least. I left the theater fuming because of all the changes made to the books. I'm not naive, I understand that a lot must be taken out to fit the time length but good God they could have shortened the 10 minute broom ride in the beginning and used it to make the confrontation in Dumbledore's office a little more accurate, or they could have added the rest of the rooms in the Department of Mysteries which were noticeably absent. Those were the 2 parts of the films that I was actually looking forward to seeing but was yet again disappointed. Instead of hexing every person trying to take him to Azkaban,as is written, Dumbledore simply grabs Fawkes the phoenix and disappears...ooh wow wonderful...God! Also, the Department of Mysteries was almost a joke in itself...apart from the missing rooms the fight between the students/Order and the eaters was also sub par. I just saw flashes of wands as the people just flew around attempting to kill each other, it was an incoherent mess. There are other major flaws in the movies but i don't have to time or patience to discuss them at the moment. If you are going to see the movie and haven't read the books or aren't extremely familiar with them, then the movie will probably be very good to you, however if you are like me, and have read the books multiple times, lower your expectations for the film and grit your teeth, you'll probably leave disappointed."
46,1,Best Book........WORST FILM,"As an avid Harry Potter fan i have grown vary as to not build my hopes up for the Harry Potter films as (apart from the Philosophers Stone), the films has not been up to scratch. Nevertheless i went to go and see the film and boy what a disappointment."
47,1,really bad,"This film was pathetic totally compared to the rest! the plot was thin, the acting dull, the delivery poor and the style the director/producer has chosen created a waste of time watching this movie."
48,8,"An improvement on Goblet of Fire, but still not perfect!","My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better. All in all, a lovely looking film, with some flaws in the first half. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
49,9,Harry Potter Back in Hogwarts,"Harry comes back on to our screens for his fifth year at Hogwarts School. This time, Lord Voldermot is back after the cliffhanger of him at the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire. Everyone is concerned about the Dark Lord's return, but things get worse The Ministry Of Magic hired a mysterious women named Dorles Umbridge who is the new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts... Harry forms up a group of Hogwarts students and gathered Dumbledore's Army. So Harry taught them about magical spells to defend Lord Voldermout's dark forces... Harry and his army is in the biggest battle yet between Lord Voldermout and his deadly Death-Eathers... Absoutley outstanding special effects, the quality of the acting was 100/100, the script was mind-blowing and the casting was top-notch!!! Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and all of the outstanding cast should deserve an Oscar for all their stupendous work! Seriously I was speechless when I left the theatres! This is the BEST Harry Potter movie yet!"
50,6,An adaptation that cannot stand on its own,"It's been years since I wrote the following words in my user comment for the first Harry Potter movie: ""I enjoyed this movie immensely. But...I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books."" By now, I must admit that the movie has held up well over all those years. It is a superior fantasy, despite my reservations about Chris Columbus's directorial style."
51,4,An Expensive Mess,"To whom it may concern, I also reviewed 'HP and the Goblet of Fire' and gave it 8 stars. Read it if you like because I sort of touch on the same issues here."
52,5,"Not bad as a movie, but definitely under explained","As a very dedicated Harry Potter fan, I have very high, sometimes unfair, expectations for the movies. It was not a terrible movie, but it was definitely the worst adapation yet and very fast paced and under explained. To the person who has not read the books, and only seen the movies they may be lost/easily confused as to what is happening. I expected that they would leave out many things, and I had already forgiven them for that before I entered the theatre. What bothered me the most was the fact that they couldn't seem to set on a mood. It seemed like the movie was confused as to whether it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. They added in American one line humour, changed some of the plot lines around, and failed to make Harry seem more than a cardboard person. The CGI effects are amazing, the soundtrack is great and will put you in the mood. However, be warned that : Quidditch was taken out of the movie, Draco was reduced to a cameo appearance, Hermoine is unlike herself, and it seemed to drag on towards the end."
53,5,The worst one,"This is probably the worst film of the entire series, it has bad pacing, a lot of plot holes and has a much worse story than the other films, some of the lore additions in this film are interesting and this film is extremely nostalgic for me but it's honestly not very good."
54,1,Why change the book ?,"First of all, i want to comment on the high points of the movie. I think the acting was great, the characters looked great, and the way they played out their parts were great. I like how Bellatrix looked and acted, it really gave you the feel for the type of character she is. On another note, the parts they cut out were parts most people were probably excited for. The circular room not being there? Honestly, why cut out one of the most interesting parts of the movie? The brain room, and the other rooms were important keys to the excitement of the movie. Also the fact that none of the children were hurt like in the book was a little overrated. Yes, this is a child's movie, but including an unconscious Hermione, Neville's broken nose, Ron being attacked by the brains and Ginny's broken ankle wouldn't have been too disgusting. Also the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort was cheap because it did not happen like it should have in the book. Neville and Harry should have been the only people in the veil room when the Death eaters were threatening for the prophecy and Bellatrix didn't even use Crucio on Neville like she does in the book to get the prophecy. The prophecy wasn't supposed to be heard till the 6th book. It was supposed to say the prophecy when it breaks. Siruis' death went way too fast, Harry didn't even mourn it. And what was up with the absence of the two way mirrors? That was such an emotional, important part of the story. Knowing that if he would have used the mirror instead of rushing out. Why was there no Marietta? In the book Cho never told, Hermione jinxed the list to put boils on the persons face. There was no dating between Harry and Cho. There was no DA coins to tell of the meetings. How are they going to do the 6th movie where Malfoy says ""i used Grangers idea with the coin, like the DA used to talk with the death eaters without being intercepted"" if there was no coins! And Harry breaking into Snapes mind instead of dipping his head into the penseive was stupid. Not to mention they cut the memory way too short. And didn't even have Lily stick up for him. It was cheap. "
55,7,Nothing like the book but a decent enough movie,"So many great parts were skipped over, rushed with ridiculous cliché transition scenes, or simply changed because, apparently, it's impossible to include everything. But what can anyone reasonably expect? "
56,1,if you've read the book....,"Well, let me put it this way, it's 2 1/2 hours of my life that I'll never get back."
57,4,two thumbs down,"I am the biggest Potter fan that I know, and i can honestly say that i HATED this movie. The acting was a touch better and the effects were up to their normal standard, but the complex, involved plot that the novel provides was completely butchered on screen. I do understand that they cannot include every detail of an 800+ page book, but certain obvious details, such as Lily Evans in Snape's memory, any mention of Neville's inclusion in the prophecy, the two-way mirror from Sirius, the locket in Grimmauld Place, Regulus Black...these details are important to future plots. They SHOULD make an appearance. The story doesn't make any sense without them. The memory itself, my favorite scene in all six books so far, is all of twenty seconds and the only characters you see clearly are James and Severus. Bellatrix says Avada Kedavra to kill Sirius. There is a reason JK Rowling did not specify the name of that jet of light that killed Sirius, and by putting the no-returns-possible Avada Kedavra on it squashes any sort of believable return from him in future. While still visually appealing, and though it hurts to type it, the film is, overall, terrible. You can't make excuses for the plot-moving details that were left on the cutting room floor."
58,6,"its OK, but don't expect too much","Pretty much what you'd expect, I wanted to like it but found it hard to."
59,5,Incredibly disappointing!,"I am a huge fan of the books. I own a popular fansite, snitchseeker.com, just so you know I'm more than an average fan."
60,1,Waste of MONEY!!!!,"This movie could not have been more of a let down! I wasn't expecting much from this film, I have grown to understand the movies can not be as detailed as the books, but really. This film should have been the Empire Strikes Back of the series, with a few great bits of action and lots and lots of set up with a OK pay off that left you counting the days till the next film. Instead we get a VERY VERY VERY watered down version of the story, with changes so people with a short attention span don't have to remember anything about this film for the next one. At least with the last 4 films the story was the underscore to the action or special effects, with this one none of that came across. This film turned into a disjointed grouping of odd scenes with nothing really to 1. set the time line of the over all film and 2. does nothing to forward the ongoing story of good vs. evil."
61,7,Darker and Darker,"After the encounter with Voldemort at The Triwizard Tournament, opinions are divided on Harry Potter. Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge is determine to squash the news of Voldemort's return, and demonize Potter and Dumbledore. The world is coming down on Potter. First he's charged with underage magic when he fought off 2 dementors. Then he finds that Dumbledore has been keeping his distance. Finally, there's a new strict devious teacher Dolores Umbridge play by the amazing Imelda Staunton."
62,7,A low down,I was pretty much excited about this installments as by now I've become a fan of Harry Potter. The movie though didn't stand on my expectations. It has plot holes and things are left unexplained mostly. Rushing the things just offers us to wonder. People are saying that the book is lengthy and therefore they were not able to accommodate things properly in the short duration of movie. Nonetheless its still a good movie and you won't wanna miss it. Well no comments on vfx which is always appealing and a treat. So again its visually good and screenplay is good as well. Yes you will find yourself waiting for the next eventually.
63,5,Not overly excited,"While the effects where superb, the movie felt like a long montage. Good job to the director for taking the heart out of a great story. For 2.5 hours I sat and couldn't' help but to think, if I hadn't read the book, I would have no clue what was going on. I had to answer plenty of questions afterwards to my friends (that haven't ever read the books) about this movie. I felt that there were many, very important parts missing from this movie. Parts that will be very important in the upcoming films."
64,,A complete and utter disappointment: An obvious terrible adaptation but by itself just a bad movie,"I at first scanned the other comment titles before writing this an i'm baffled as to how many people actually thought this movie was good. I on the other hand found the movie to be anything but that. Yes, I am a hardcore book reader but i must say this first. I have come to terms with the fact that the movies are not the books and so from there i say that the 1 and 2 weren't bad adaptations and 3 and 4 were decent movies minus my feelings about the book. As movie alone they can stand on their own but this movie is a different story."
65,1,Misses most of the book out!!!,"I love the Harry Potter series and I have to be dragged away from them, so this film came as a big disappointment."
66,6,"What Was Done, Was Done Well, But HP5 Does Not Even BEGIN To Live Up To Its Potential!!","I wanted to love it. I have anticipated this movie for several years, now, but I have to say I was terribly disappointed by this installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise. This was one rich novel, and one horribly chopped-up film! It's almost as if the director was handed a few sequences and told, ""Make a movie,"" and the remaining 2/3 of the book were left unattended."
67,1,A huge disappointment for fans and newcomers alike,"I simply do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this movie. As a standalone work without reference to the book it was dull, yet glitzy, incomprehensible drivel. It became almost impossible for someone who had not read the texts to understand a thing, especially for one who had not before seen the films. Many characters were never introduced and there was no significant character development nor was there real motivation for actions given."
68,3,Choppy vignettes don't make a film,"I used to like the HARRY POTTER movies and books – the first three at least. They were everything I expected from children's entertainment. Then the books started getting longer, it was obvious Rowling was only doing them for the money, and I personally believe they should have ended with the fourth book, as the last three add absolutely nothing to the storyline apart from extraneous detail. The same goes with the films."
69,9,Daniel Radcliffe finally grows into the role of Harry Potter and gives the performance of his career. Yates is the best director the series has had.,"There is no doubt that Harry Potter is an iconic character of a generation, and it would be very easy for filmmakers to go 'typical Hollywood' on the film adaptations and coast through for the sake of money. It is remarkable, however, to witness the awesome dedication from people such as David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, and especially the young Daniel Radcliffe. The crew of these films work so hard to preserve the magic and brilliance of JK Rowling's novels, and it really shows on screen in the brilliant performances, beautiful sets, and masterful direction."
70,1,Yates Transformed the best book in the worst movie,"The HP's 5th book is the best for me, who still not read the 7th book yet. The book makes me fly to Hogwarts and the history is complete and fabulous."
71,5,"As the series grow darker, Harry grows older, and in this new installment, adaptation is nicely done but lame visuals.","As a die-hard Harry Potter fan, I can't help but say I left the movie feeling a little disappointed. No, it was not because of the cut scenes that were in the book, but the visuals itself was bad. Acting, I was impressed with. Imelda Stauton as Dolores Umbridge was wicked, and she added a bit of light humor to the dark movie. Evanna Lynch, her first on-screen performance, does a truly believable job as Luna Lovegood, balancing well with her bizarre ways and her light-hearted ways. Helena Bonham Carter, as the psycho Bellatrix Lestrange, proves that she had fun portraying an evil person. Despite her short time on-screen, she leaves us with a haunting effect. The story, I'm not complaining. It was well paced, (not fast nor slow)and I enjoyed the tender moments between Harry and Sirius. The screenplay did not take us right into the action, but had built the momentum for the final sequence. I'm not going to reveal anything, but the final sequence (included scenes with Voldemort vs. Dumbledore, and the gang in the Hall of Prophecy) was visually and actively stunning, but I wished the action was a tad bit longer. The part of the screenplay that disappointed me was Harry venturing through Snapes' mind, where we see a brief look at James Potter, Harry's father, which not well shot at all. Now, the visuals. The howler/envelope at the beginning for Harry, telling him he had done underage magic in the presence of a Muggle, was the fakest thing I had ever saw. The howler looked like it had come out a Blue Clues show, for it was so... aminated, so unrealistic. I remember being so distracted by the fake thing I even didn't hear what it said. Next, the giant, another fake-ish creature in the movie, I mean, seriously, it looked like it was plucked out of a cartoon show. And the centaurs, you know what, let's not get started on that one. Warner Bros. is an extremely successful movie company, and a lot of money went into this movie, and yet they provide us with sloppy CGI. On the other hand, the thestral were impressive, not what I had pictured at all, but will do. The scenes with Harry teaching the DA was well done, to my relief. It had humor, ambition, visually stunning spells, and us viewing Harry maturing as he teaches others. Despite sloppy scenes and visuals, I did sort of like this movie, for its darkness, for the final sequence, for Imelda Stauton, Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter, and for its steady pace."
72,7,"Magic adventure with full of imagination , fantasy , emotion and state-of-art CGI","New episode known as ¨Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone¨ deals with Harry Potter and friends fighting dark forces in an amazing adventure .

73,1,"Yet another tiring, and repetitive adventure with Harry Potter, this series feels like it's running out of steam!",This review contains some spoilers.
74,,By the book,"Those who have read number 5 of the Harry Potter series can see that director David Yates has rendered the events in the book in a faithful and orderly manner in this movie. He has lost no time in setting up the scene, the Order of the Phoenix in earnest preparation against the onslaught of evil and the final showdown between light and darkness not unlike what you see in the Narnia Chronicles. That however will take some time to come, two more movies, to be exact."
75,8,Front and Center for Dumbledore's Army.,"Term 5 at Hogwarts for Harry and the gang and it's a deeply unsettling time. Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again."
76,1,Harry Potter and the Abysmal Waste of Talent,"I have discovered tonight one of the reasons that I normally DON'T pay full price to see movies! I have just returned from seeing the latest Harry Potter movie adaptation, and suffice to say, I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! The Hollywood movie machine just keeps making progressively worse adaptations of J.K. Rowling's beloved books. I don't know who's making the decisions about this franchise, but whoever they are, obviously never read any of the books, or just doesn't CARE. I mean, who let this slipshod, hacked-up, cinematic Dungbomb get through? For those of you who ""just see the movies"", and have never read the books, or at least THIS one, you may or may not be disappointed. Those of you who complain that the ""movies are just too long"" will be happy, as this is the SHORTEST of all the HP adaptations yet. (Frankly, I just think that America's attention span in general is just TOO DAMN SHORT!) However, therein lies one of the reasons it was so awful. The general spirit of the book, that of The Ministry of Magic trying to quash rumors of Lord Voldemort's return, and the subsequent rebellion by Harry and company, is kept alive, but only to a certain point. I went into the movie expecting a whole hell of a lot more for my movie-going dollar than I got. I even had just finished rereading the book to refresh my mind on all the points of the plot, most of which were just.....not there! "
77,8,"At last, a Potter that stands head and shoulders above its origins","The above heading might be a bit misleading. it birth in books was no mean feat---Rowling clearly dipped into a pool of immeasurable imagination to spring seven consecutive stories upon us in a rather short time. But where the books have begun to fail, and where this film triumphs, is in INDEPENDENCE."
78,7,Introducing the Nurse Ratched of Hogwarts,"This fifth installment in the Harry Potter franchise doesn't match Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic vision brought to life in the third film, but it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor, ""Goblet of Fire."" It shares some of that film's sense that a tremendous amount of plot is being squeezed into too short a film, and that all sorts of things that might bring subtlety and nuance to the story are being left out, but it's crisper and better adapted -- you don't have to have read the book to understand what's going on."
79,2,AVADA KEDAVRA to this Muggle filth,I LOVE the Harry Potter series; this was my favorite book so you can imagine my excitement when the movie came out. After reading some of the reviews I feel like I missed something because my excitement quickly turned into frustration as I spent most of the movie pulling at my hair and yelling at the screen. I cannot believe that it took 2 years to create a movie that strayed so far from the book that to call it Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is false advertising. 
80,1,Simly a puppet show!,"What was expected to blow me away, like the 3rd and 4th films did, turned out to be the worst movie experience I've had since the passion of the Christ. And let me make what I think absolutely clear: It is NOT OK that they've altered so much from the book. They could have stuck with the book without necessarily facing too much screen time. There was much cut out from Goblet Of Fire but it didn't prevent it from bringing as much magic to the screen as humanly possible."
81,1,This summer...Transformers rules,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a wonderful book that I thoroughly enjoyed. And so, I thought that the movie would be equally good, and I also thought this because the other movies were excellent. However, the 5th movie was absolutely awful. They left out so much in the movie that would have had a great impact that it was astonishing to me that it wasn't included.Why does the fifth Harry Potter film show so little feeling for its characters? Possibly because it is directed by David Yates, the fourth director to work on this series and the first with no experience on a Hollywood movie; most of his work so far has been in British television. Perhaps he was too busy learning the ropes of such a technically challenging film to keep his eye on the story's heart and soul. I do like Harry Potter movies, but this one...watch something else. Worst part in series :("
82,7,Hogwarts united against the forces of evil... and oppressive bureaucracy?,"Looking back at the first films, I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have expanded the story so generously hadn't she been carried away by the success of the first books and their respective adaptations; probably getting new ideas with -this time- the cast members in mind and so many vehicles for new CGI ""wizardry"". Her 'baby' was undeniably caught in a virtuous circle and the fifth opus ""Order of Phoenix"" was no exception."
83,6,Needed more of the Order of the Phoenix.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, this is the fifth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry and Albus Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities when authoritarian bureaucrat Dolores Umbridge takes over control of Hogwarts, all the while the threat of Dark Lord Voldemort returns full force. "
84,10,Best Harry Potter Yet,"I am a big Harry Potter fan and I loved the books and movies, as soon as I saw the international trailer for U.K and U.S.A I knew it was going to be the best Potter yet. Last night I came back from my vacation from U.K and I went to the advance screening and it was the best one yet. It left out some stuff but you can't except them to make a film from a book and make it only 2 hours. It would be about 15 hours it the translated the whole book. "
85,,Arguably The Weakest Harry Potter Film.,"After the truly magical Prisoner of Azkaban & darkly fascinating Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix arrives as the fifth instalment in the 8-film series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. And while its source material was the longest in the series, the movie is surprisingly short. And not just that, the film in itself is a major step down as the narration & presentation never really clicked this time."
86,7,"Finally, an HP film worthy of the name","While 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' isn't quite the epic that fans of the books had hoped the HP films would grow to be, it is a worthy film and joins 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as the most redeeming of the film series. OotP sees Harry, now aged fifteen and more a man than a child, entering his Fifth Year at Hogwarts. Although Ron and Hermione continue to provide unyielding friendship and support, our hero is bitter and jaded in the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and questions his role in bringing down destiny. In addition to his burdens, he also has to deal with the new harsh, unsympathetic DADA teacher Umbridge, appointed by the Ministry and determined to discredit Harry's claim that darkness stalks the wizarding world once more, and Voldemort plundering his mind through telepathic (leglimency, for fans) means."
87,6,The Order of the Phoenix...,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter and a few more people believing that Lord Voldemort is back and as in all the movies of Harry Potter and in this one we have a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry also has some strange dreams which can not explain but only one thing he can understand and that is that Lord Voldemort is searching for something important."
88,9,"Darker, Moodier But Rushed!","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie, no doubt about that. The only thing that went wrong is the how the movie was adapted from the novel. Many action-packed scenes were left out. Any way, Harry goes for Year 5 at Hogwarts and he must endure the hateful Umbridge and teach some students magic that Umbridge refuses to teach. The acting in this film is the best. Radcliffe did a good job showing Harry's emotions from the book. Everyone else was good as well. The technical aspects(cinematography, camera work etc) of the film is fantastic. The score is not that bad. Hooper put together a nice piece of work. There should've been more scenes that were in the book including Quidditch(Weasley Is A King, Fight with Malfoy), the Rita Skeeter interview, and the explosive anger towards Dumbledore. Other than that, this is a good film. I rate this film a 9/10."
89,9,"Well, I Admit It, The Best Potter Film Yet! (SPOILERS)",SPOILERS
90,10,Much to Praise in This Outstanding Adaptation,"The Potter films have been getting better as they are released. Some of the subtleties that were notably absent from the first two entries are now very much in evidence, and unlike other series, the main actors have developed and grown into more assured professionals; a fact that is remarkable, considering that the young protagonists must hold their own against some classically trained actors. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe is so confident that he owns the screen with visual expressions that allows us to understand the growing pains of the character, his turmoil, and his ever increasing crisis."
91,1,"Terrible Adaptation, With Awful Direction and a Screenplay to Match...","Easily the most-anticipated of all the Harry Potter books to be made into film was The Order of the Phoenix. It was a book that I read at a certain milestone in my life, and to finally see it in a movie theater was a treat."
92,8,Darkness Grows,This is the first Harry Potter movie that I've given a rewatch. Jaime watches them regularly as they are comfort food for her. We been busy and she considers them to be Christmas movies since they usually feature the holiday since it is during the school year. Something I want to include is that this is when the books started to get interesting for me. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is having more of a presence.
93,6,Imelda Staunton steals the film...a darker than usual Potter...,"For a film that has been doing fantastic box-office business, one would hope that HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX would be a much more energized and fascinating movie than it is. Instead, it's like watching a rehash of previous Potter subplots, previous ingredients stirred into a new stew leading to a climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort that ends in a blaze of fireworks."
94,1,"Man, I really HATED this movie completely!","I'm a fan of good fantasy movies, but so far everyone of the five Harry Potter movies have been fairly dull, boring, and incomplete."
95,1,Disappointed,May Contain Spoilers
96,8,Characters Development,"The Order of the Phoenix does what every HP movie does. There is significant world-building, new elements to be added to the larger plot, and a satisfying wizardry action. Yet, Order of the Phoenix shines best by its use of character development."
97,,A delightful and gripping transformation of a boring book,"This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord."
98,7,Going down,Okay before this movie it really is feeling like the movie series is scarily is only about the money and name now
99,9,Harry Potter gets dark!,"HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) is really, IMHO, the first Harry Potter film to be purely dark in overall tone and mood. There is a sense of doom, sadness, and dread that permeates throughout that is not really completely present in the earlier films. ORDER is actually the 2nd Harry Potter film that I saw when it first came out (GOBLET OF FIRE being the 1st), then I went back and watched the first 3 (SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZKABAN) on DVD. All films before ORDER definitely had lighthearted moments of fun and whimsy. ORDER does not and I think that's a good thing! In that sense, I'd say that ORDER is the first ""mature"" Harry Potter film."
100,8,When it started to get REAL dark.,"Professor Umbridge is of course a character that we all love to hate and has a very dislikable quality, and it was good to see her get some good well-deserved justice whenever she did. I thought the action in the 3rd act was good as well (mainly with Dumbledore and Voldemort) and it was also very emotional when Sirius Black got killed (reminding me of the Godfather part 3 with the silent scream Harry did). The film had many good, intriguing ideas like the prophecy and the part of the ministry where all of them were stored. With that being said, I never read the book so I don't know how well a lot of the material carries over. But I still can't care too much, I'm a movie person and this was a good Harry Potter movie! (However they're never bad really)"
101,7,Everything is beginning to change...,"I'm not a Harry Potter fan and have never picked up a Harry Potter book, but I find the concept quite interesting as the world of the wizard becomes more fascinating as each book comes out..."
102,6,the weakest of the franchise.,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , and the fifth of the franchise, most unfortunately is the worst, I do not like this movie, more does not mean it's bad , it has positive points , the villain of the film is good , Imelda Staunton, this excellent as Dolores Umbridge , you feel hate her in the film, Helena Bonham Carter , is another who is back in the squad, and she also sends well , has good moments , the moments in the room need are good , plus the script has problems , the pace is low, the film is tiring , is unnecessary moments , the direction of David Yates (who will be forgiven by the next film ) , is only average , the soundtrack is good , and the special effects are great , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the worst in the franchise, is more watchable. Note 6.7"
103,1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the movie, if you read any of the book you found yourself wondering if you walked into the wrong film. I have just returned home from the 12:01 showing of the film and I can't believe that I will never get those two hours of my life back. I had my reservations about some of the actors chosen to play the characters (Umbridge, Tonks, Luna) but these portrayals were not bad, Tonks because you really have no idea who she is, she is only in 2 scenes. Trelawney was sacked before Christmas, all Weasley products were banned by a decree, (apparently Umbridge was way ahead of us all because Weasley products don't really come out until book 6)Grimmauld place is never cleaned during the holidays, so the locket that is so crucial to book 7 never shows itself as being in the house, I could go on and on. It makes me wonder if anyone at Warner Bros has read the book, and how in the world JKR let this movie be made. On the other hand, 3 of the people who went with me had never read the books and they thought that the movie was great, action packed."
104,9,Another fun and great showing of wizardry,EXPECTO PATRONUM!!
105,1,It Stunk miserably,"I thought this was the second worst movie in the series (number 3 being the worst). I know it is not possible to put the whole book into a movie but they left out some pretty important stuff. No quidditch, no prefects, no St. Mungos, etc. Also, why could they not follow the same timeline at least. Snape giving Occlumency lessons before holiday break. I think they could have gotten a little closer to the book. The bad thing is that because of all the stuff they left out, I don't see how HBP could possibly be a good movie. If you watch the movies and don't read the books, you are truly missing out on the story. The movies after 1 and 2 have not done the richness and depth of Rowling's story any justice."
106,3,A Good Looking Movie with a great ending...but an extreme let-down to fans of the books,First let's get this out of the way: this movie looks fantastic. The visual effects are top notch with realistic looking fireworks and spell casting.
107,1,Worst Movie Yet,"All the other Harry Potter movies nearly followed the book and were like each other, but Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix was absolutely horrible. It didn't follow the book, and it was unlike all the other movies. In the third movie, the dementors looked like they had black cloaks over them, but in this movie, they had faces and looked like they were wearing normal clothes; they didn't even have the hoods that were mentioned in the book. And, the carriages didn't look the same as they did in the fourth movie; in the fourth movie, there were roofs for the carriages, but in this movie, the carriages didn't have roofs. In the book, Professor Umbridge and Harry were supposed to be super friendly with each other, but in the movie, Harry was super rude to Professor Umbridge, and Professor Umbridge was mean to him. There was absolutely no quidditch, Creecher was barely shown, and when Sirius died, it was supposed to be really, really sad, but it barely looked like that. I admit, I did cry when he died and it showed Harry ""screaming,"" but when I read the book and learned that Sirius died, I cried more. This movie was nothing I expected it to be; so much was taken out from the book! In the first, second, third, and fourth movies, it pretty much followed the book, but this movie did nothing of the sort. 1/10 stars!"
108,10,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"The movie was so amazing. I enjoyed the movie, the story was better than the first parts, the action scenes were excellent, better in the stages than the rest of the parts, the acting in the movie was excellent, a wonderful movie and I recommend watching the movie and rating it. For movie 9.5."
109,7,All in order,"I recently enjoyed ""The Order of the Phoenix"" while watching through all the Harry Potter films without having read the originating books. In a sense, it seems that it might be called ""Harry Potter does political thriller,"" and, as it turns out, Harry Potter does a pretty good political thriller. It means that the intriguing and vast fictional world that these take place in is sufficiently developed that its characters and situations can theoretically be dropped into all kinds of different story and the associated references can be assumed to be understood."
110,8,One of the better HP movies,Harry Potter finally got a haircut lol.
111,10,I HATE UMBRIDGE & LESTRANGE!,"Although the story is not as interesting nor great as the previous HP films, therefore deserving a rating of 9 out of 10, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" still gets a 10 thanks to the actresses who played Dolores Umbridge and Belltrix Lestrange. They were scene stealers!"
112,1,"Not bad, but not good, and too short","This movie, put simply, was made for anyone that has NOT read the books. The plot was really just small snippets of major plot points, with their only purpose, to lead us into the intense final battle scenes. The fight scenes were part of the movie that were done quite well."
113,10,The most underrated Harry Potter film!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) follows Harry as he finds his warnings of Voldemort's return have gone largely ignored in the wizarding world. This film is brilliant and really builds up the danger Voldemort poses! It's tense, with a lot of emotional weight and so much character development!"
114,7,Lots of talking but has it's fine points,Rating-7/10
115,7,"Good movie, Mediocre Adabtation","Plot: Harry saves his cousin Dudley from two dementors, but by using magic outside of school he needs to go to a trial. After being found not guilty, he spends the rest of the summer at his Godfathers Sirius' house. When he goes back to school, his new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher Miss. Umbridge basically tortures him, Hagrid is missing, Dumbledore won't look at him, and Harry keeps having dreams about a door at the end of a long hallway. "
116,9,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Yes! I cannot believe I have now seen all the Harry Potter films, at least for now ;). Well after watching the last four Harry Potter films, I was definitely interested in seeing where the story would lead us next. The Order of Phoenix was absolutely astonishing and without a doubt the best Harry Potter yet. See, my friends who read the books didn't get much of a kick out it like I did, but I think they were just comparing too much book to movie. Who knows? After reading the books, I'm sure I'd be like that too, but movie wise I thought this was a great movie to watch and a terrific film for the summer."
117,7,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) - I Must Not Tell Lies? I'm Telling the Truth!,"Chapter 5 of the adventures of Harry Potter, ""The Order of the Phoenix"", has reached more complex ideas that makes this movie darker and dramatic so far. Now, although some parts in the movie were too pointless, I thought it couldn't beat the awesome new storyline added with cool cinematography and awesome music. And also, the new performances provided by Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, and newcomer Evanna Lynch were all quite wonderful and super well-performed. I also love the change in Harry Potter's character where he starts becoming a teacher to the students, when teaching them to defend themselves, but he ends up being controlled by Voldemort and needs help of his own. Also, it looks to me that this Harry Potter flick got even darker with everything that is dramatic and mind bending. Now, I think I have another personal favorite Harry Potter film because of the drama, and dark material. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", in my review, ""dark storyline, but way too pointless""."
118,3,worst one so far,"I admit the shortening was not done that bad, we got a nice whole story, but some things were just missing. Seriously, I can understand that they can't do the whole book exactly like it is, but there are some little things that are important, perhaps not for the plot of this movie, but for the two coming up, like Ginny having a boyfriend (as for her ""giving up"" on Harry), or Ron and Hermione being prefects. Of course it may be, that these things seem only important to me.. whatever, I missed these things,although not as much as I missed Quidditch, which did not occur at all =( OK, I CAN see, that it is not really sufficient for the whole story, and takes precious time away, but I can still miss it, right? And what was that about the completely different Dementors? I mean, OK, different director, different style, but this? They weren't even hooded... So I didn't like the dementors, but I really liked the Ministry of Magic, the Atrium looked fabulous, I just loved that scene, although that big Fudge picture was a bit funny. (perhaps a bit too dictator-like..) The worst scene was the one in the Department of Mysteries. I was really disappointed by that scene. They really should have done that circular room and at least some of the other rooms as well. I don't care tooooo much about the other things I missed, but this really sucked. I mean, how could they leave out that room of time, the Death Eater with the baby face, the brains in the tank? And of course, my favourite, Ron behaving strange, laughing about everything, and calling out something like ""Look, there are brains in there. Brains... Accio brain!"" and actually summoning a brain. And not just the Department itself, but Sirius' death.. THAT really was the worst part of the scene. They actually managed to do it so badly, that I felt absolutely nothing about seeing one of my favourite characters die (I cried a LOT when I read the book) and like that wasn't enough, they even make you forget about his death in less than a minute, as no one really seems to care about it. So they really did a bad job on the end, which is really really bad, because it's THE END, and even if you enjoyed the movie until then, you go out of the cinema with that horrible ending on your mind and end up hating the whole movie, just like I did."
119,5,"The Biggest Book In The Series, Becomes The Shortest Movie.","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", is the biggest book in the series, yet the shortest film. Anyone who has read my review of the last instalments knows that I was impressed so much with the series, I finally decided to pick up the books."
120,1,"An awful director, an awful movie, an awful bit of foreshadowing for HBP","I just got back from the midnight premiere, and I'm completely disgusted. The movie was a bland, sepia-toned mess! Hogwarts has apparently shrunk. The Grand Hall was pathetic, and it seems roughly 50 students attend Hogwarts now."
121,8,Much more mature and much better,POSITIVES:
122,4,The Downfall...,This is where the downfall of the Harry Potter movies began.
123,7,Order Of The Phoenix Entertaining For The Most Part,"Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix is an entertaining film for the most part. It's a worthy addition to the franchise and director David Yates does an admirable job of turning this book into a movie which can go either way depending on how close they stay to the material. For the most part Order Of The Phoenix is enjoyable with some flaws. The talented cast are good in their roles including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman are great in their supporting roles but most of them don't have much to do and lack screen time. The movie still seems to be juggling too many characters with some of them getting the short end of the stick. Despite its flaws the film still has some action maybe not as much as the previous one but they're well executed with great special effects, a little romance, and some humor that make it enjoyable. I do prefer the Goblet Of Fire over this one but Order Of The Phoenix isn't that bad of a movie. It just could've been a little better if the movie was faster paced with less supporting characters and more action."
124,,"Editing and Plot holes aside, it was amazing!","Out of five stars . . . I'd give OotP four of them. The movie is very emotional, not just because of what Harry is going through, but because the movie really tries, I think, to pull the audience into Harry's emotions so that you can connect with him more and really feel what he's feeling. They use very quick, brief flashbacks from previous movies to help achieve this and it's done really well. It's incredibly ingenious and I loved it."
125,8,A Marked Improvement,"Well written & well paced, a marked improvement over its predecessor, even with some of its (forgivably) dated effects; as the characters mature, so does the filmmaking."
126,8,Complement to the Book,Those who read the books first may be disappointed in the film. Those who haven't may be puzzled by some of the plot. But reading the book first makes some of the action in the film more understandable.
127,4,I really liked the Harry Potter movie series... until now.,"There were so many integral parts of the book that were completely left out, or altered so severely that they didn't even resemble the book any longer."
128,9,I-MAXimum Loved it!,"Yes, after reading all The HP Books 2 or more times, I found much to love in this ""Illustration"" of the ""Order of the Phoenix"". Our Cast has developed as have their characters - From a Darker, Moodier, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, to a Rule Breaking Emma Watson as Hermione. Maggie Smith as the uptight McGonagall now turns some of her Ire Against an Authority figure (Umbridge)! "
129,7,The coolest one in the series!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth installment in the HP series and this film may be a little bit action-packed, but it works for me."
130,8,Older and even darker,"I thought the last two installments of the Potter films had been dark, but none, to include the fan-favorite 3rd film, has been this dark or this good."
131,4,"Sorry folks, this one just doesn't fly!","I was so looking forward to this installment of the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed this book immensely and just knew that it would make for a great movie. Well, was I ever wrong! The first mistake was in the choice of director. David Yates might be good at directing TV shows or crime dramas, but he totally screwed this up. Can we say welcome to the Imelda Staunton Show? Were they sleeping together or what? I mean REALLY! And yes, I understand the need to compress a very long book into a workable movie script, but there were so very many important plot points that were either totally ignored or else so changed as to be unrecognizable. Would it have been so difficult to work in that Ron and Hermione were PREFECTS? Did they have to make Cho the traitor - I mean what is one more small part (Marietta) in a movie that consisted of small parts - except for Imelda Staunton's part! I didn't even recognize Mark Williams for heaven sake! I thought they had gotten an actor who kinda maybe looked like him! And whose idea was the revolting...i mean revolving Daily Prophet???? Show the damn thing once and get on with the movie!! That was simply a waste of time and made most of the audience dizzy."
132,1,"Anyone who gave this movie a 10 is Stupid, Delusional, or Lying.","Before I start, let me say that if you a fan and you gave it a 10, your category is delusional. Don't worry, I included you."
133,6,Ehh,"While this isn't the worst adaptation of the books to movies in my opinion - that goes to PoA - this is a very close second. I think the acting was great, the directing fine & special effects spectacular, except for the dementors: why did we need to change them from their earlier wonderfully-creepy look? Unfortunately, I think the screenplay was abysmal, & I'm ever-so grateful that Steve Kloves is back for HBP! I understand that, this being the longest of the books to date, there were bound to be many omissions. I can (grudgingly) accept that. However, when integral plot points are completely altered (Cho Chang is the snitch?!?) I have a HUGE problem with it."
134,7,Not as worthy as other parts,This did not do very well on account of the hateful character of Dolores Umbrish; the unclear contexts; poor chemistry of Harry and Cho. Nevertheless there were interesting elements like direct encounter between the death eaters and order of Phoenix; of Dumbledore and Voldemort (who can forget). Also the importance of friendship and love as above any fear or evil is crux of the part. The surprise that the Wesley brothers offered in the middle is also worth mentioning. Overall you just cannot miss it as it is part of the legendary series.
135,5,Harry Potter 5 a BIG disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this movie all the others have followed the books rather closely(with a few exceptions) This Movie did NOT!! there were so many things left out or Drastically changed(The coins for D/A,Umbridge blew a hole in the wall to get to the Room or Requirment(in which they do show forming)They never show Sirus mother screeming or Buckbeak(weatherwings Btw Sirus looks Like a pirate not a wizard.).. Necessary Things that held the book together. There were scenes where it never happened in the book and harry scar was missing from 3/4 of the movie. the Story was weak but the cinematography was good."
136,10,The fight of the Voldemort and dumbledore,The right of the Voldemort and Dumbledore is magnific
137,4,Great book.... poor movie,"Book was so full of information, it would be difficult if not impossible to make the transformation. They took out so much that most of movie I felt that I was witness to repeated inside jokes, because of all the material that was mentioned but not explained... I don't think the movie would make much sense if you hadn't read the book..."
138,6,"Like a firmly built bridge in connecting the series, but not very memorable on its own","While it is a step up from the previous film, the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still does not quite capture the figurative 'magic' that the first three ( Especially the third )."
139,7,Surprisingly Bad. (SPOILERS),"The Order of The Phoenix book was my favorite. However, the movie failed to impress me. I felt like putting an almost 900 page book into two hours and eighteen minutes is horrible. The single reason I am giving this movie a 7 out of 10 is because the climax was putrid. In all the other Harry Potter films the story starts off small and slowly leads up to the dramatic climax. For the order of the phoenix, the climax is the fight scene between Voldemort's death eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix. However, in the film the climax is only two minutes long. In the book, it described in detail, the fight scene in which harry, his friends, and members of the order took on the ministry. I was so EXCITED to see that fight and I became disappointed when it only lasted a few seconds. I would've love to see Tonks battle Bellatrix Lestrange. The thing I really wanted to see was how Ron, Neville, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, got away from Umbridge and her ""army."" I thought the director spent too much time concentrating on Umbridge, and Dumbledore's army. The climax wasn't exciting like the other films. I did however, really enjoy the acting. When I read the book, I had a picture in my mind about what Umbridge was like, and it was exact. She was portrayed impeccably. Same thing with Luna Lovegood. I guess my expectations are getting higher, and higher. And my expectations weren't met."
140,6,This is my blog entry after watching the film.,"==========TO SOME, THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILER, SO STOP HERE IF YOU ARE STRONGLY AGAINST SPOILERS.============="
141,,complete disappointment,"i do not understand how anyone who claims to be a ""die-hard fan of the novels"" could regard this movie with anything other than disappointment. from this point on there will be spoilers so if you haven't seen it yet, read no further."
142,5,A bit of a drag,"One always knew that, as the length of the HP books increased, turning them into films was going to get harder. So to be fair, one must remember that the Order of the Phoenix is a heavily padded book lacking the tautness of the first three novels as well as their clever plots. With the Goblet of Fire one still had an excellent plot but the padding had begun."
143,7,I was expecting better,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not a bad movie. It's just... I think this was the first case when a HP movie could have been better than the book, as the book is simply too long; it has too many plot points that it has to tell as an exposition for the last two chapters; too many new characters etc. (don't get me wrong, I love all the HP books but I find OotP the weakest of them). This movie runs through the story which results in a very long hour of talking. After the unexpectedly dark, thrilling opening sequence it's all about talking maybe until 1:35 or something like that in the movie, which is actually necessary for the 7-book story but a bit...dare I say, boring. Yes, we can say it is more 'grown-up' but grown-up does not necessarily mean boring; even if politics take part in the conversation. As this is the shortest movie of the five, maybe this time they should have included some quidditch in ten minutes just for fun and excitement (the quidditch story line is, once again, totally missing); maybe there should have been a little more emphasis on the romantic part as well. We see all the necessary new characters like Tonks or Bellatrix but they get way too short time on-screen. During this talking part the director tries to add some momentum several times but usually fails; maybe it's all because of the mentioned 'too much plot, too many characters' problem. It should have become a kind of thriller but even the nightmare sequences can't help creating real tension. Then, in the last 30-40 minutes, action begins and while this action is not really awe-inspiring, it is on par with the spectacular action sequences of the previous movies. So... It's not a bad movie, it is functional and I am sure the next one will be better (partly because that has a much stronger story)."
144,9,ONE OF THE BEST !,"This is definitely one of my top 3. The character development was amazing , I love how they displayed the trauma Harry Potter had during his life , that's not something many movies do. The acting was very powerful, it's like I actually felt the characters pain and the way they displayed the differences between Harry and Voldermort was amazing . My only problem with this movie is that it can come off as slow, some scenes were unnecessary and can cause the movie to look boring. Other than that it's really good."
145,1,Worse even than Fracture,"The scriptwriter for this movie should be made to cut a switch for himself to be whipped with. The dramatic scenes were terribly done, and the transitions from sad scenes to happy and back were completely disjointed. Had it been but a half-hour shorter the movie would have turned into a series of unconnected sketches. Every scene was cut far shorter than it needed to be to convey all its information, and there was little transitional material. The action scenes were shot in a manner that reminded me of concert cameramen from the 60s, with almost every shot zoomed in so they could make the ""special effects"" large flashes of color, instead of something requiring effort."
146,10,HP 5 - The Best yet !,I went through a lot of comments on IMDb & realized that most of the people who were disappointed with the film had one common reason to give - It did not match up to the book i.e Many important scenes were left out.
147,9,Haters: It can't include everything!!!,Granted... as someone who has read all the books countless times and listened to Jim Dale audiobooks too. I would have loved the movie to have everything that's in the book.... BUT that would have been a 12 to 15 hour movie and STILL not cover the fine points.
148,7,Another entertaining addition,The fifth film in the Harry Potter series was always going to be the one that could have been a problem in my opinion.I say this because the book 'Order of the Phoenix' was very long and there were parts of it that were drawn out too much although it was still a good read.I am happy to report that I feel that the film makers got it just about right with what they left out of the book and left in the film.
149,5,Impressive... but not as amazing as the book,"As many other people are saying, the movie was impressive, but not as impressive as the book. I understand that it is nearly impossible to fit certain details into the movie, but I felt that there were some of vital importance that were left out. For example, Hermione and Ron becoming prefects was a big deal in the book, at least as I remember it. Didn't that create some of the turmoil between the three that was clearly shown in the movie? I could list many other things that the director left out, but although they may not have been the most important details that JK provides in the book, everything connected back to each other. I felt that the movie was choppy and switched from scene to scene without really detailing how the characters got there. I was extremely disappointed with the plot line at the end of the movie, at the Ministry, because they did leave out all the battles that Harry and friends face before he and Dumbledore battle Voldemort. I don't know about you, but I was interested in seeing how the movie would portray Ron being attacked by a vat of brains. I thought the effects were great during that whole part, but I was annoyed that they revealed the prophecy to Harry in the presence of his friends. In the book, he doesn't learn what the prophecy says until after wards, when he and Dumbledore finally meet in his office. This also unleashes a problem for the 6th movie, because in the book, no one knows if Harry really is ""The Chosen One"", except for Dumbledore, and Ron and Hermione, who he tells later."
150,4,Virtually no interest for non-devotees of the book series.,"The action in this movie is completely mechanized and the plot only serves us to move us from point A to point B (more like point A.001, actually) in the Potter saga, unlike in previous films where the plots themselves had arcs of their own and the revelations, such as they were, were actually dramatic."
151,7,This was a letdown.,"The 5th movie in the Harry Potter series is just alright. It's not as good as I remember and it's the worst so far. The acting could have been better and I wish we got to see more of Voldemort. The thing I really liked were the characters, I really liked their development in this movie."
152,7,Now I see: they're portraying totalitarianism.,"Whereas it's been a few years since I read the novel on which this movie is based, I had forgotten a few things, so the movie refreshed my memory. Obviously, any book-to-movie adaptation is bound to have at least a few flaws. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" certainly can't equal the book exactly, but I really like Imelda Staunton's role as fascistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (I assume that if you're reading this, then you know what that class is; if not, then read the books first). This vile woman, dressed like a slightly drabber version of Jackie Kennedy, makes it her goal to overthrow Albus Dumbledore and totally seize control of Hogwarts,* engaging in all manner of torture when she deems it necessary, all the while sporting an unctuous smirk. Maybe it's just me, but I derive that this installment in the series is an indictment of totalitarian regimes."
153,5,"Nothing New, Just Another Year Older","I don't want to do it but I have to talk about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It is the 5th highest grossing movie from 2007 coming in at $292 million. I think we all know why Harry Potter was able to hit such a high number for 2007. Two words...Harry Potter. That's right. The franchise has now hit such dizzying levels that now no matter what author J.K. Rowling hands out it will be bought up and sought out in such high numbers so quickly that there is no stopping its success. This time out in the story we find Harry wrongly accused by the Ministry of Magic. Harry is coming into his teenage years and with that comes angst which even manifests against Dumbledore. Voldemort is stronger than ever and in an effort to squash him out again Harry and his posse of wizards form Dumbledore's Army. Well this leads to conflict as you can well imagine and does not sit well with Dolores Umbridge, the new Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts. With all this conflict around in combination with a 14 year standoff with Lord Voldemort it should be no surprise that all of this leads to a giant wizard face off of good and evil with loads of special effects. Daniel Radcliff along with his companions Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as the three main characters know this material well and their performances are right on par with what is expected. This is also not Ralph Fiennes first time in the ballpark as Voldemort and along with the rest of the cast of characters, they all play their parts with ease and comfort. They all look very comfortable in their skins this 5th time around. A shinning spot is actress Imelda Stauton as the Dark Arts Professor Dolores Umbridge. She is fresh and fascinating to watch. Where the movie lets us down is the script. There are some of our favorite characters that don't get a single word in the film. And shockingly some of the special effects, the ones over London especially, seem like 1970s film-making. I don't blame Rowling at all as she has given the screen writers more than enough material to work with. Because of them the movie is stale and it feels like most of the film is just filling us in on their series rather than making it new for us like the first time.  Poster fans will love all the variations of the characters and we're even treated to an IMAX 3D version of the film and a poster."
154,3,Rushed and disappointing,"I found this movie very disappointing and the weakest in the series so far. The exposition is very rushed and jerky, as if the director was checking plot points off a list and dashing through them as quickly as possible. Also, very annoyingly, he doesn't trust you to notice something he wants you to notice and has to beat you over the head with it, whether it's the Harry-Cho-Ginny triangle or a simple detail like Luna Lovegood being barefoot in the forest. Speaking of which, Evanna Lynch's performance was disappointing - Luna came across as more smug and self-satisfied than dreamy and unself-conscious like she should have been."
155,5,Disappointed,"I am so strongly disappointed at this movie that I can't even bear in words. Although I had expected this, as no previous movie was any match to the real book, I really wanted more."
156,8,skillful adaptation,"This is a first: a Harry Potter movie that bests its source. The first, second, and fourth movies were okay at best, and the third one was as good as the book. But book 5 is the weakest of the bunch, and the filmmakers have done what I was hoping they would do - distill it. In the book, Harry's life reaches new levels of miserableness, and he turns into an irritating teenager. Making matters worse for the reader is the fact that the book sorely needs editing; it takes forever to get to Hogwarts. The book is filled with so much unpleasantness that it's a chore to trudge through. Plus, it introduces the series' most annoyingly cutesy secondary character, Tonks."
157,7,Harry Potter movies no longer good for book fans.,"Let me first preface my comments by saying that above all I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. And until now, I was a fan of the movies as well. But Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a book fan's nightmare. Not only are the most pivotal emotional scenes robbed of meaning (Snape's worst memory, Dumbledore's office scene at the end), but basic themes from the book are crushed into powder finer than the glass shards from the climactic, yet mostly garish final battle sequence. The best line in the movie is lifted directly from the book (Hermione's line about Ron's emotional range). Perhaps most atrocious of all is the constant innuendo towards a Harry/Hermione romantic attachment. I understand that Dan Radcliffe/Emma Watson is a more desirable on screen couple for movie marketers, but the sixth book dispels any chance of that, so what is it doing in movie 5. Most disappointing of all was the Dumbledore/Voldemort duel. The book version is filled with banter and new and interesting magic. The movie version relies on wowing us with shiny particle effects which were no doubt expensive."
158,10,Very very excellent movie,"A lot of people criticise this movie. Before I watched it I though I'll be disappointed but contrary was the case. Helena-Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was pretty fantastic, she did very good job. As well Evanna Lynch aka Luna Loved or Imelda Stunton aka Dolores Umbridge. But Jason Isaacs in the role of Lucius Malfoy will be for me the most fantastic person forever. You know I am deep-rooted fan of Jason/Lucius and I love him. I gotta say that he was the most handsome in The Order Of The Phoenix. My the most favorite scene was the one when Sirius says ""Get away from my godson!"" and punches Lucius (lol). Or when Harry says ""I've waited fourteen years"" and Lucius does the perfect sympathetic face and says ""I know"". If If I'd have to write my favorite scenes I would be here from dusk till dawn. As well Severus Snape is amazing. He is my second favorite character. But it's a shame he isn't in The Order Of The Phoenix more often. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are getting older but their performances are really good. By the way Voldemort was brilliant. I don't want to say that this movie is without mistakes. There are some. I think The Order Of The Phoenix is too short. I lack for Quidditch. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is really indispensable character. He is on the scene too little. Of course everyone confronts the movie with the book. Over these minute reservations, I want David Yates to shoot the 6th and the 7th part. Sorry for my English."
159,8,For A Film Based On A Terrible Book...Not Bad,"I've read the first 3 Harry Potter books. I usually see the movies first then read the books, otherwise I'll just nit pick the movies to death. Just ask anyone that was lucky enough to see any movie based on a comic book with me. My wife on the other hand is a Potter fanatic, and has read all 6 novels and is waiting with bated breath for the 7th and final book to come out."
160,7,Steady start for Yates as he takes Order of the franchise.,"David Yates may not be able to rekindle the excellent form shown in movies two, three and four however his first of four Potter films he directs is a fine entry into the collection - even if it is a little disappointing."
161,9,"Loved it, Warts and All {:-}","Evening descends on Hogwarts . Hagrid stares out of a window in his hut; Harry, Hermoine and Ron follow his gaze. A storm approaches, billowing ominously. Howling wind blows between the cracks in Hagrid's door, seeming to spread to the very edges of the wizarding world. Hagrid broods: ""It's happening again you three... just like last time."" Alas, I can only paraphrase, but Hagrid's warning captures a pervasive, unmistakable sense of impending doom. The characters - and the audience - begin to feel; to understand: Lord Voldemort has truly returned, and his campaign to terrorize the wizarding world - all over again - has begun."
162,10,"Excellent, Best Harry movie so far!!!!","By the time i saw the very first trailer for this movie, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I was completely amazed and I knew I needed to see it. When I seen the movie the first day it came out i was speechless. David Yates the director did a fantastic job on this movie and it is the best one in the whole series. Although the movie cut out some of the most important parts of the book, he made it even better adding great scenes that made the movie so good. Goldenburg, the screenwriter wanted to make it shorter because if he had put everything in the movie would end up being 3 to 3 and a half hours long. The sixth movie should be even better because Yates is directing this one as well and the original screenwriter Steve Kloves is coming back for this and hopefully the last movie as well. I have no problem with the screenwriter for the 5th movie but he cut out much and I love the 6th book so Im sure Kloves will do much better to put in all important scenes. But if you love Harry Potter and like the movies the YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It is the greatest one so far..."
163,10,best Harry Potter yet and one of the best of the year,I have always like the Harry Potter and after I saw the third which I loved and the fourth I really like I could not wait for the fifth and which I was told that one was the best book by my friends. When I first saw the trailer I knew this movie was going to be great and then when I saw the movie when it came out I got a little more than I thought I would. This movie mood and feeling is very dark and you kinda felt what Harry was going though. The directing is fantastic for someone just come to the Harry Potter series and kept up with the good movie. The acting like the other movies are great and even better. I really don't know if the film keeps true to the book but I have heard mix reactions with that and other than that the writing is pretty good. If you are a fan of Harry Potter and fantasy film this is no question you have too see this film.
164,8,A great improvement on the book,"I was very pleased with this movie; in contrast to the other books, I found Order of the Phoenix as a book pretty dull and forgettable. But I felt the movie really brought it to life and narrowed it down into a much more succinct story. Some people would see this as a negative and others will think it is a positive."
165,8,An underrated installment that thankfully maintains an appropriately dark tone,"It's more than just Voldemort that Harry's going against now. It's the fact that he's fifteen. What I'm surprised not many others have pointed out is that Harry's actions, feelings, and self-""justifications"" are very much in line with how some fifteen-year-old boys act. He thinks he's alone, no one wants to help him (it doesn't help that many students now distrust him), he's not confiding in his friends, and he thinks the world's out to get him. Well, he's half right. People are out to get him, use him, and ultimately bring him down. But what he needs to learn is that friends are at his side, that there are allies to trust in dark times. Unfortunately for him, growing up is going to get in the way of discerning dreams from reality."
166,,Lessons learned.,"""What makes Harry and buds more interesting than ever is that they care more deeply about each other and take more time to figure out their strategies, the way intelligent adults do."" So I said about the third Harry Potter installment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I can't say that for the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which uses much elementary wizardry and too little caring, except for Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) ambivalent kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), in honor of diversity, I suppose."
167,7,"Alright , but true to the book",Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix is a real war movie. In this movie it is more about human rights but also about the first confrontation between the wizards.
168,10,Great and emotional,"Well, for me it was a pretty great movie. I am too, a huge book fan. But I know that cinema and literature are two well respected but totally different arts. The narrative in both has to be managed differently so the message can get to the spectators. So I understand the challenged it is to adapt a novel and turn it into a script. "
169,10,Spectacular!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth installment of the J.K. Rowling saga and like each of its films, they keep getting darker and better not to mention bringing along a different crowd rather than the readers, the fans of the atmosphere, or people who have crushes on the actors."
170,6,Don't set your hopes too high,Let me preface this by saying that I've never read any of the books.
171,10,Blimey Harry! Since when did you pick up acting?,I thought it was brilliant. (although I am MUCH more anticipating DH -i can not sleep waiting for it's release~!! :<) 
172,10,Harry getting more like James with every scene,"If you compare every Harry Potter film to the books, this is the biggest disappointment. Although the book it was based on was the longest Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 2nd shortest Harry Potter movie."
173,10,The Best Harry Potter to Date,"With the fifth Harry Potter film finally arriving, there were huge expectations that many were upholding. Would new director David Yates ruin the series or would he effectively translate the magnificent J. K. Rowling book to the screen? Who would play the loopy Luna Lovegood? Would the fifth film be sufficient in establishing a mature and dark mood? All these questions and more were answered, all with incredibly positive effects in the best film out of the whole series. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix translates perfectly on screen in the most flawless installment yet. Starring in the film are regulars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, and this time around they are joined by newcomer Evanna Lynch, and a supporting cast that can only be described as ""amazing""."
174,6,My Least Favorite HP Book Was Loads Better than the Movie.,"This Harry Potter movie was way too different from the other HP movies. I'm not sure who is the person that is the most to blame for this. It could be the director David Yates, who has never directed anything else that is recognizable. It could be the screenplaywright Michael Goldenberg, who is filling in for Steve Kloves, who is leaving this HP episode as the only one he's not screen writing. Or maybe J.K. Rowling herself, for writing books that are so varied in length, and for forcing the makers of the movies based on longer books to compress stuff and cut important stuff out."
175,8,Finally an adaptation worthy of Rowling's name!,Note: this review is for those who already read the book! 
176,1,A disappointment...,"I was extremely depressed by the way this movie turned out. I, being one who read and appreciated the story in the book, was forced to compare it constantly to the movie. The movie lacked significant parts of the book, parts that do end up in later texts, such as Siruis' two-way mirror, Ron and Hermione being prefects, and Neville being able to see Thestrals and hear the voices from the arch, while Ron and Hermione can not, which they made viewers believe that Neville could not.."
177,10,Still going strong,"It might seem at first like the slowest moving episode, in the whole series, as the plot its a bit more relaxed and yet will cause the viewers too grow some towards a certain character, not wanting to say more for not revealing too much, but it is worth it to watch and find out who I am talking about. This movie will tie the knot between past and present, the former battles and the present one's. The former combatants and the contemporary one's who are actually for the most part, their children. It is still going strong in captivating its audience, but you could never expect less from the great author that is J K Rowling."
178,2,like sitting under a cruciatus curse,"OK, I simply cannot understand all the glowing reviews! ""Separate the movie from the book...""????? Why in the world should someone have to separate a movie from the very book upon which it was supposedly based???? The reason I went to the movie was to see the things I loved about the book - except I didn't get to see them."
179,4,Very disappointed,"There were so many crucial plot elements for the next two films that were glossed over, that I wonder how they can ever recover. Mundungus Fletcher was the first glaring omission. Yes, he doesn't add too much to this plot, but he is crucial for later films. They didn't spend enough time at Grimmauld Place. Kreacher, RAB, Phineas Nigellus Black, the locket - all are critical to the next two installments. The omission of the new prefects, Harry missing the Quidditch matches, both of these contribute to Harry's state of mind throughout the story. Fred and George experimenting on the first-years, and the goal of opening their own shop? Gone. Their spectacular exit and the long term repercussions? Gone. The Department of Mysteries apparently only includes prophecies. And snake bites aren't really all that dangerous. Harry sneaking into Snape's pensieve? Gone. The OWL's? Apparently just another test. Oh I could go on and on. There was so much wrong with this movie, I fear for the next two."
180,1,What a crappy movie,"As a big fan of the books (read them in German, Danish and English and all of them about 10 - 20 times)... so I had a lot of expectations, especially after knowing what you can do today - just see how well Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings... so I have thought that Yates would have been more faithful to the books, but again NO... none of the instructors have made a half decent movie... The lines are awful, and all that happy clapping... fx. when Mr. Weasley returns from hospital is just annoying... What made me most angry was the way thinks were changed... fx. Why is Harry telling Dumbledore the prophecy? Dumbledore knows it... The way the movie started was also changed (Harry would NEVER have shown his wand to Dudley's friends)... And why is the Dursleys going to the hospital?"
181,7,"Good, but was kind of awkward...","This movie was not my favorite when I first watched itnot going to lie. They never really went into Sirius Black's character as much as I would have likedand even for the book to kill of Harry's only ""family"" left was depressing. It's like Harry can't catch a break when it comes to the people he loves. I was actually surprised Rowling didn't kill of Ron or Hermione in the books...but that's another subject. The second time I watched it...it was better. When you watch this movie for the first time, you get lost and confused because they are moving the story line way too fast. One minute Harry is in London, and the next thing you know he was kicked out of Hogwarts and on trial to get back in. That is why I didn't really like it as much as I should have. Honestly...take this movie, and watch it once, then watch it again a few days later and it all makes sense! If you're not up for watching a movie twice to understand it's meaning...then this is NOT the movie for you. I loved it...mainly because I'm a sucker for epic fantasy movies."
182,5,Not worth 8+ rating..,Hey guys i dunno how i could see 8+ rating for this film..This film is not really worth that rating...i understand I'm being skeptical but no matter this film is completely off the book..I missed magic in this film..The story moves very slowly in the first half and moreover the duel at the ministry of magic was very disappointing...The whole shelf of prophecies smashing etc etc and where did the half moon spectacles of Dumbeldore gone??I was an ardent fan of movies and books of harry potter but this really brought the heck out of me...Luna was perfect for the story so is Imelda Staunton...At least the forthcoming movies should be made according to the book..
183,5,The Worst One Yet!!!!,"This is my favorite HP book and I was quite excited to see the next installment in the series. My brother and I saw it the second day it came out I was so excited. During and After the film I could definitely notice that a lot was left out from the book . I thought that this movie should've been spilt into 2 parts maybe but thats just my opinion. The acting was good and the actors who played umbridge and Bellatrix were great and were my favorite characters in film.Steve Kloves should've come back for this movie, David Yates isn't a great director in my opinion and they should've hired a much better director for this one. As a film and for people who haven't read the book you'll enjoy it I think. JK Rowling said this was the best one yet apparently thats what is quoted on the Order of the Phoenix wiki page. SPOILER ALERT Spoiler Alert this is about 10 or 20% close to the book, please do yourself a favor and avoid this awful and sad film "
184,5,series showing signs of age,"In ""The Order of the Phoenix, "" the time-marking fifth installment of the lucrative ""Harry Potter"" series, the teen wizard and his fellow Hogwarts sidekicks are girding for battle against the recently returned villain, Lord Valdemort. They also have to wage a battle on a second front, against a sadistic dictatorial teacher named Dolores Umbridge, who has decided to remedy the ""lax"" standards at the academy and, in doing so, usurp Professor Dumbledor's position as headmaster of the school."
185,4,David Yates should be incarcerated,I have waited a good time between reading the books and seeing this movie the first time to try to give the film a second chance with more of an advantage. It did not work at all.
186,1,Horribly Magical,The previous four Harry Potter movies have been designed for people who are too lazy to read the most amazing book series to land on this planet in years. This movie left fans dazed and confused as they searched for understanding in this year's adventure for Harry and his friends. This movie did JK Rowling's work absolutely no justice. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a faithful Harry Potter fan. I have been in line at midnight on several occasions and am not afraid to admit it. This movie has ruined Harry Potter for many people in my life who left the theater utterly confused. It also didn't make me happy that I had to sit and explain certain things from the movie for over an hour. I understand that this is a long book to be condensed into a movie. I give the directors credit for condensing. They could have had another hour of my time without a care. This was the most wasted two hours I have ever spent in my entire life. I recommend that no one sees this movie ever but that instead you read this book and the rest of the series so that you can truly understand the magic that is Harry Potter.
187,9,Do people who hate this movie understand what an adaptation is?,"I'm literally laughing at some of these reviews and wondering if they even know what an adaptation is. This movie in my opinion did a great job of bringing OOTP to life. Maybe it's too short and 10 minutes, which knocks it from being a 10, could've been added but I don't care. Let's just get with the review."
188,1,Please don't waste your time! **** SPOILER WARNING!! ****,"Well, I just returned from seeing it and I must confess only two words come to mind: astoundingly bad. I mean, really, how can you spend all that time, effort and money only to produce something like this? I'm sad to say this movie made me feel absolutely NOTHING. It is a soulless, emotionless empty shell. For me, nothing demonstrates this film's emptiness better than the post dementor attack scene with Mrs. Figg. The actor was obviously directed to behave as if nothing unusual has happened as opposed to the wild terror the character shows in the book."
189,1,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix rolling around in its grave,"It was by far the most disappointing movie-related experience of my life. I wouldn't even go as far as saying that this film was movie based. It was, perhaps, inspired by a book, who knows."
190,6,something is missing in this film but I can't decide what,"This is the first Harry Potter film I have seen, with no prior knowledge of the series or the books. Perhaps not the best place to start, but with the considerable recaps of what has gone before, 'The Order of the Phoenix' proved reasonably easy to follow."
191,3,How can you call this amazing?,"Seeing the midnight show like i have before every other Harry Potter movie, i never thought i would be so disappointed. Every aspect of the book was either changed, not in the movie or crammed into 10 seconds of dialouge. The whole movie seemed rushed and trying to catch up with itself.The blatant use of unnecessary computer graphics was bland and uninteresting. The fight scenes at the end were fabricated and had little meaning to them. Sirius died the wrong way and before i could emotionally react. I also believe that harry was begging to be killed under the cruciatus curse."
192,5,I-Max 3-D Potter Disappoints on All Levels,"Television director David Yates makes his first foray into cinema with the latest Harry Potter entry and does so with decidedly mediocre results. Although he does show some stylistic restraint at appropriate times, his handling of narrative elements leaves something to be desired. Also, his movie is literally just too dark, which seems to be an unfortunate trend of recent comic book films (Spiderman, Superman, and of course Batman) that pose as serious-minded and penetrating ventures into the human psyche but are actually just as shallow as their predecessors. The darkness of the new HP adds little to the story and is too literal-minded. But more to the point, it is entirely inappropriate for the IMAX DMR 3-D format."
193,8,Amazing entry and very important movie to the franchise,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was directed by David Yates and is the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter franchise. This movie shows how much Harry has grown, as he and his friends have to stand up against authorities that try to takeover Hogwarts."
194,1,Disappointing acting and poor editing,"Compared with Mike Newell's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, David Yates's Harry Potter is such a disaster. Its failure, in my opinion, is due to poor acting and disappointing editing. Daniel Radcliffe's acting is getting worse and worse; his poker facial expression and unnatural body language disengage the audience largely. Editing slows down the flow of the whole film while the acting of the cast is not strong enough to boost it up. I found the appearance of the Chinese woman 'Cho Chang' particularly vexing and unnecessary as well. Harry could have fall in love with other characters such as Ginny Weasley or Luna Lovegood. This Harry Potter simply cannot be more engaging even with Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange."
195,6,Nothing impressive,"yes its another harry potter film but it brings nothing new from the last one really (past storyline advancement) and with the exception of the 10 minute climactic fight at the end, you can literally sleep through the movie."
196,10,Magical and,"First of all, I would like to say that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of all of J.K Rowling's masterful books thus far. Which is why I was extremely nervous to watch the movie, for fear that it would not live up to my expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the movie began. Through this movie, the new director has managed to maintain the darkness and political satire of the novel and portray it in a way that was not only fun but beautiful to watch on screen. Despite the fact that there were many parts of the book that were cut out of the movie, I was left feeling utterly fulfilled. While the first two films were extremely precise and technical, they lacked the magic that the audience feels while reading the books. This movie brought back that feeling for me and allowed me to become completely immersed in the characters and their journey through adulthood. The details simply don't matter when watching the important movie, it's all about the tone, and this one was full of darkness, much like the book. Ron and Herminor, played by Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, were extremely lovable in this film in their everlasting pursuit to stand by their best friend. They add many funny extras to the movie, as does the PERFECT Luna Lovegood. Professor Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Alan Rickman were also stunning in their roles. Please go watch this film! Don't listen to any bad reviews, they simply aren't true."
197,7,Imelda steals the show,"Overall, not a bad film, especially the opening sequence which'll have you quivering behind the seat in front! Great effects as always."
198,7,Feast or famine? A little of both.,"Let me start by saying that book 5 of J.K. Rowling's is my least favorite of the wonderful Harry Potter series. It's too long, with too much run-on writing, and it seemed to me that she had to manipulate Harry's personality to make the plot work, so much so that it often came off as contrived. That being said, the movie has gone a long way toward trimming the fat, and improving on the meandering of the book's nearly 900 pages. I'd have to say that, plot-wise, I enjoyed this Harry Potter more than any of the others. The new non-CGI characters, Dolores Umbridge, and Luna Lovegood, are transferred from the page to the screen with near perfection by Imelda Staunton and Evanna Lynch, respectively."
199,9,The best of the 5 so far!!!,"If i'm honest, i watched the first 3 films before i had starting reading the books so i had no problem with not comparing them so it was a strange,10 minutes in i was thinking about the bits that were missing from the book BUT i soon forgot about all that and started enjoying it for what it was..a FILM and an excellent one at that. The action, the fast pace of the narrative, the effects, the first-class acting..the sets aremind-blowing...it was definitely worth sitting 2 hours and a bit for. if there's one film you must go and see this year it's this one- i've already got seats booked for the 3d version at the imax which i've never done before."
200,7,"""There's a storm coming Harry. We'd all best be ready when she does.""","I'm not a reader of the Harry Potter books but I've been watching the film adaptations in order and I'm starting to hit a sticking point. Reading other reviews of this installment in the series I don't feel so bad now that it was somewhat hard to follow for me. The principal characters don't seem to be as engaging as they were when first starting out, and even though that might be a result of the actors getting older in their roles, there's just something elusive that's missing here to make the adventure enjoyable. The situations and dialog seemed to enter clichéd territory a good part of the time, and the overall impression I had when it was over was that I was simply tired of it all. Which doesn't bode well for the remainder of the stories, even though I'm sure enough that I'll go on to finish the films in due time. As usual, great special effects and colorful use of Hogwarts language, but the return of Voldemort wasn't epic, and the introduction of new characters left me uninterested. How about a Petronus charm to liven things up next time."
201,3,"David Yates, you have the right to remain silent.","OK, WHO ASKED THIS GUY TO DIRECT?!?! What IDIOT wrote this thing?!?! I always liked the Harry Potter movies, but THIS...I didn't get a thing that was going on, and I READ THE BOOKS!!! Nothing flowed, it was like the guy in the projection room was fast-forwarding the film at random intervals (""Hey let's have fun with the audience!"") The only reason I gave this a 3 was because Umbridge and Luna were FANTASTIC!!! "
202,4,Film: Underwhelming; Radcliffe: Cute; Fiennes: Evil; Women: Lose,It amazes me that seven billion of the six billion people on the planet (slight exaggeration) are fervent Harry Potter fans.
203,6,A Handsome Runt of a Phoenix,"The phoenix of legends died in flames and then rose from the ashes to new life. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" does no such thing. It neither croaks nor soars. "
204,3,"Worst of the lot, and that's saying something.","If I hadn't previously known this movie had been adapted from a book, I would've expected to come here and find a trivia item stating: ""filming started before the script was finished."" There's no storytelling here - it's just a collection of scenes put on film so ineptly that one must have read the book AND watched all four prequels IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO VIEWING! Assume that you're about to see an intelligent, engrossing tale which stands on its own as far as emotional investment goes... and you'll be as lost as I was."
205,3,A world of pain!,"I wasn't a big fan of Goblet of Fire and went to Order of the Phoenix with the illusion that it could only be better than its predecessor. Now that I have seen the movie it depresses me that I have been wrong to have nourished this hope. The acting has reached a new low. Daniel Radcliffe manages to mess up every scene he has. Because the movie is more about Harry Potter than about actions, the scenes that Daniel has are many and shortly in the movie become too much too handle. There were moments when I buried my head in my hands out of awkwardness for the shame full performance I was being presented. Ron is also being portrayed badly, but has the luck of being off-screen most of the times. The Hermione moments are being force fed with a lethal high dose of girl power which ruined the performance of Emma Watson whose was not bad (at least not compared to the rest). As for most of the other characters, (with the exception of Snape) there is not much screen time for them, but they manage to ruin these brief moments with out of character performances. The leader of this gang of hoodlums is Michael Gambon whose performance hasn't managed to make us forget the late great Richard Harris, but make us miss him with every second Michael Gambon is on screen. Gambon has turned Dumbledore into a unstable loon who threats his enemies with more kindness than his students. The character who stand out positively are Snape (brilliant as always), Voldemort (as steady as in Goblet of Fire), Luna (she breathes Luna without trying), Lucius and Bellatrix who do not stand out, neither positive or negative. The script is impossible to follow for someone who hasn't read the book and confusing for those who have. The scene hopping is worse than Goblet of Fire, although the newspaper montages have been done well. The movie rushes through the huge storyline and the few action scenes which could have boosted the movie are not spectacular and over before you know it. There is no time for emotions because the moments have passed and become incomprehensible seconds later, leaving the viewer confused and busy trying to catch up again. Actions from characters are illogical and in conflict with the books, most of the time backed up with special effects which are illogical and in conflict with the books. The rather small amount of special effects (compared to the other Potter movies) manage to turn out disappointing and make you wonder if they have the right people behind this, because other movies have managed to show believable special effects. All in all a disappointment and new dept in the Harry Potter movie franchise."
206,7,HUGE disappointment,"OK, I am a really big Harry Potter fan, and for the movies I don't ask too much. I loved all of them and I have read all the books. First the movie starts well, It was faithful to the book and I was really enjoying it. Then the kids got to Hogwarts and Dolores Umbridge was introduced, Imelda Staunton was perfect. Then... I got really bored about the film, the problem is that all was happening like the book except that it was not as funny and entertaining. There was no action and I was expecting a huge battle between the Inquisitorial Squad and Dumbledore's Army. Umbrdige said GET THEM!! and nothing happened. I loved the conflicts about Harry's connection with Voldemort. And loved everything. Although some bits with Sirius were a bit dull. But the film got so bored that it got really repetitive. They talked and talked and then Harry goes to sleep and he has a nightmare, this happened so many times I lost count. I was expecting the big finale between lord Voldemort Death Eaters and the good guys. And when the battle started, boy, I was so disappointed. It last practically nothing and I couldn't believe it. I had seen the behind the scenes specials and what they have filmed was amazing! But in the movie there was really little of it and it seems stupid. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was good but not enough to justify the rest of the battle scenes. Although the possession scene was actually pretty intense, excellent. In conclusion this film seemed like Star Wars Episode II, too many dialogs and trying to be funny and no action and at the end there was not enough. I am actually very worried about movie 6. I am hoping this film doesn't kill the franchise. 6/10"
207,7,The Worst Harry Potter,I think the outcome of the Order of the Phoenix was poor and i didn't really enjoy the film. I thought the storyline was boring and i think they have lost ideas. I really hate Dolorus Umbridge she makes my skin crawl. In the other films there was an interesting plot but this one didn't engage me. Although it's the worst Harry Potter movie i still don't think it's a bad movie because some parts were entertaining and funny for example the introduction of Luna Lovegood. I also enjoyed the ending of the film i thought it was very dark. It's good to see all the characters grown up and matured. It is propably the most underatted one and of the most hated ones.
208,3,"Hated it, hated the Director & most importantly hated the Screenwriter **SPOILER**","Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books, many times, and watched every film with baited breathe. This was my least favorite movie, but not only that, I truly hated it! **Please excuse my spelling of the names, I am writing fast and have no time to check**"
209,3,"A movie full of magic, but with little heart","First off let me say that as a die hard Potterholic, I tried to like this film, honestly I did. Now, that being said, this was the closest I've ever come in my entire life to walking out on a film, and for those who know me that is really saying something. The first half of the film was simply put, horrendous. The movie begins as a collage of mis-matched scenes accompanied by stilted dialogue, which is followed by a tolerable second and confusing third act with a disappointing finale. I don't know if it was the script they were given, or perhaps the direction of David Yates, but the actors seemed incredibly uncomfortable in their characters for most of the movie. I don't know what happened with Michael Goldenberg, or how he confused exclamation marks in the novel for simple periods in the screenplay. At times it seemed that all Harry would do in the book was scream and yell, yet he quietly delivers his lines with little to no anger, only a tired reservation in the movies. The Weasley twins even go so far as to poke fun at Harry for shouting, which was supposed to be funny, but only leaves you confused as to what ""shouting"" they're referencing."
210,5,Worst Adaptation of a Popular Book in a Long While,"I will never understand why studios take popular (in this case WILDLY POPULAR) books, and create movies with scripts that at best dumb down and leave out important details and characters, and at worst, totally eviscerate the plot with an insulting screenplay. This movie falls into the latter category. As a Potter series fan, this screenplay basically says we will throw what is the most commercial money grab--time compressed--second grader appealing film possible and for those who are looking to enjoy what they found most appealing about the books-- Get Bent; we don't care about what made these books so popular in the first place. I've now watched the movie several times over the last year and a half and dislike it more and more. To the point that I would rather not ever see it again. A good example of successful book adaptation can be seen with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. With the Potter films they had a perfect opportunity to have long running, detail dense, faithful adaptations. They even could've split a book such as should've been done here (which Tarantino and others have already proved to be commercially successful). Instead we find ourselves insulted with a half-assed attempt at resembling the source material. The best book in the series is reduced to the worst film. Shameful and one for fans of the books to avoid."
211,8,"Good movie, but it could have been so much better","The fifth movie in the Harry Potter tale has been taken on a new journey with a new director and a new style, however after seeing it's debut tonight in the ACT I can't help but feel a little disappointed. "
212,10,As a Harry Potter Skeptic.. Best movie of the series,"I grew up in the hype of HP but only ever watched 1-3 and eventually the last three movies as they came out. I enjoyed the first ones for the nostalgia but never sat down and filled in the gaps. I started rewatching all of the movies and after suffering through the goblet of fire this movie was one of the best of the entire franchise. It is absolutely pivotal for me to of seen to understand the emotional significance of the rest of the series. I saw some reviews that said it wasn't enough like the book, I'm grateful I never read the book and so I could just enjoy this for the cinematic marvel it is. I'm deeply impressed by the cgi after many years and a decade later. The acting, storytelling, and emotion far surpassed any of the other movies."
213,1,if you really love the book...then please don't watch it!!!,In one line I hate it!!!! I m a true harry potter fan...and i just hated the movie they ruined the novel... heres a better suggestion...they should have borrowed the idea and made a whole new movie out of it instead of ruining the story... the movie is nothing like the book...and this one was the best out of the whole series.... Another suggestion would be that they read the whole novel before making a movie out of it instead of skimming through the pages....this movie somehow makes u feel as if you are just watching highlights or a promo...all the fun parts are missing...and the ones that the director was kind enough to keep...well i wish they weren't there at least... How can J.K allow this.... I don't understand why don't they try to stick to the story line....its perfect as it is... so my advice would be to all the harry potter book fans...if u love the book really love it...then just don't watch it... For the parents...make your kids read the book instead of taking a shortcut and torturing their brains
214,7,Harry reborns from ashes (dvd),"Before his lame three future movies of HP, Yates delivers at last one good movie! First, the movie benefits from the excellent story of the eponymous book. It's not that i don't like the others but after this one, HP turns into private Potter and wizardry becoming war isn't my cup of tea. Here, they are still students and it's really their last one when they look still childish. Next, there's a great addition of new characters: Evanna is as eerie as Luna and Nat/Tonks directed a very funny making-of in the extras. But only the books will give you a deep view into them because in the movie, they are only fly over. I don't forget Dolores Umbridge who teaches a good lesson for audience: bad, mean people can look sweet and gentle! The trio faces a interesting evolution as well: Harry lacks patience and shows anger while Hermione and Ron are really true friends, accepting him as he is. So, it's really about helping each other and not fighting. The production and sets are beautiful, especially the Ministry. Its gloomy and mazing architecture recalls ""Brazil"" and above all, the entire movie is fortunately not salvaged by a poor cinematography. In conclusion, it's a vivid, full-colored phoenix that we got there!"
215,8,"Under Yates, ""Potter"" No. 5 beautifully embraces the dark side of the novels","Despite its fourth director in five tries and even a new screenwriter, the Harry Potter franchise takes a huge step forward in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" based off the fifth book in the young adult fantasy series by J.K Rowling. Whereas Harry's character growth took a backseat in the Mike Newell-directed fourth film, ""Goblet of Fire,"" ""Order of the Phoneix"" restores our protagonist to a place of inner turmoil where he is set to achieve great personal growth."
216,2,Big Fan + Big Book + Big Let Down = Bad Movie,"OK so I am a huge fans of all the Harry Potter books, but then again i am not super obsessed with everything Harry Potter (no Quiditch Sheets on my bed)."
217,1,Order Of The Phoenix is a huge and giant disappointment !,"I am one of the biggest Harry Potter book fans on the planet, and have bought each and every one of the wizard's fantasies since the 1990s, from Philosopher's Stone, to Half Blood Prince. I even have my deposit slip for the Deathly Hollows on the 21st."
218,10,The Best Potter flick so far,"The book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is unwieldy and cluttered, so much so that it is by far the most boring and weak of the books so far. However the movie has taken the ingredients of what could have been a great book and turned them into a great film by trimming off most of the excess fat."
219,,Fantastic,"Usually, if a film series ever reaches a fifth installment, the franchise has long shown strain and popular interest is long gone. 'The Order of The Phoenix' is something of a miracle in several respects. It shows great imagination and no sign of fatigue or lack of ideas despite it being the fourth sequel. This is due almost exclusively to the novel's author. It also offers the audience a delicious peak into the minds of a radically talented writer and director."
220,6,"No magic, no fun","I saw HP and the Order of the Phoenix when it opened in theaters last year and now I have just finished watching the DVD of the film. I found the film quite disappointing. The script and the direction reminded me of old TV series. The ones where everyone stands around while the main character carries the load. Yes, there are fine actors in the movie and I am thankful for the few lines they spoke. This far down on the list of comments, I don't imagine anyone will be reading my remarks so I can babble on for a bit."
221,5,No Fun !,"When I say, it's dare to say, among (Harry Potter)'s fans that I had no fun watching its series after part 2, it's more or less an unforgivable SIN!"
222,5,This is why content should not be removed for Cinema releases...,The Film started quickly and badly and also ended that way. The story was a poor parody of the film and missed out many key plot developments and the characters which brought them about.
223,4,The Best Book! The Worst Movie!,"I strongly believe this movie is a case of watch the film then read the book to get your epic experience of JK Rowling's Harry Potter adventure. I like many thought if done properly this movie would almost be like what The Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars, boy were we wrong! From the Start, The Film is rushed into play with a scramble of scenes to set the (to fast) pace for this adventure, along the way shortly into the film undersized scenarios and many disjointed plots creep onto screen, whilst some capture the book for a split second, others become irrelevant to the point of why were they even shown? The change in screenplay writer and the Editing along with the direction of this film is very much lacking and it begins to feel more like a made for T.V movie than a box office Blockbuster. PLEASE Bring back Steve Kloves! Many people in my theater who were egger to see HP5 Order of The Phoenix became lost with plot and were trying to understand what was going on, as the entire cast looked like Extras except for Harry? "
224,7,Something different,Something new; new themes were added but the characteristics and the form of the series continued.
225,7,"Now, the situation is becomes serous!","I can't say that the plot of this part of the film is as interesting as the plot we are used to in previous parts of the film, but I can definitely say that this part breathed life into the idea of a new dimension of the film. To everything else in the film (characters, scenes, dialogues, etc.). All this heat-up of the plot, accompanied by the development of Lord Voldemort in the background, is a very nice way to say goodbye to the elements of the film that make it childish. Watching this part of the film, the world of magic we are used to becomes more realistic and thus better in the domain that no matter how much we know that magic is beautiful and useful it can also be dangerous and uncontrolled and that is a good effect. The plot in this part of the film is not as interesting to me personally as it was in the previous parts of the film, but I am willing to relax and let JKR do what it intended to do, and that is to finish this story spectacularly and as much as possible realistically. Introducing the character of Professor Dolores is a great idea but I think her tyranny could have been portrayed a little better with stronger effects to the detriment of other actions in the film that were unnecessary. I don't like the way Dolores was eliminated because I think it could have been a more spectacular way to symbolize the end of a disgusting tyranny. The Order of the Phoenix is a great idea, but unfortunately it has not been given the attention it deserves. I believe this is because it is impossible to screen a book, which we are used to when it comes to Harry Potter books. Perhaps we could have paid a little more attention to the Order of the Phoenix itself as well as Dumbledore's army because somehow Professor Dolores, the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army and Lord Voldemort are key elements of the film. I see this film as a continuation of the seriousness of Harry Potter, which in the last scene in this part of the film made it clear that the next sequels will be more serious, darker and more realistic and therefore worthy of the name Harry Potter and his fame in the world. Finally all the children go into oblivion and all the adults enter the game. I would praise the murder of one of the main characters, at the end of the film, but I personally didn't like the way it was done because I think it was supposed to be more emotional and somehow stronger and bigger. Either way, I am ready to enter the final phase of this film from which I expect a dramatic and screenwriting spectacle."
226,10,Fantastic!!!!,"The movie is fantastic, but it is way to short It's like only the high lights from the book is in this movie, and it lives me whit a empty feeling when it's over I know that almost 900 pages would make a very long film, but then again, what true Potter fan would mind a move that last 3 + hour ;o)"
227,1,"If you have never seen a movie, don't make an exception for this one!","When I walked out of the theater, somebody behind me said, and I quote: ""All in all, another good film."" Personally I think this film is an approach to what Rowling means with the agony of the cruciatus curse: You'd rather die than going through this much pain any longer! I felt violated and never wanted to inflict physical pain on someone (preferably the director of this pile of nose-pulk) more than after seeing this film. It would probably have been better if Daniel Radcliffe at least tried to remember anything from his acting classes (though I seriously doubt he has ever taken them), and would at least show SOME interest in the art of acting. Furthermore, this movie makes me wish for an early death of Harry Potter in the books. If he can die right at the beginning of number 7, that would be swell! We can watch Daniel Radcliffe die in the film, and maybe (and that is a huge maybe) enjoy the remainder of the film. The character development has been incredibly bad from the first movie on. But in this part, they have hit an ultimate low. I went to the theater without any expectations. It is something like a miracle to experience that the people responsible for this pile of garbage have been able to crush even the complete absence of expectations. They can crush emptiness as it were. Along with Alan Rickman, this last thing is worth applauding. Alan, you're great! Your performance in comparison with the other actors in this film makes you a God! (which after out-acting Kevin Costner you of course already were, but now you're an even bigger god, you're like, THE GOD of acting). But than again, everything in comparison with... makes it godlike! Team of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, go die! (except for you, Alan, you know I love you, you God you)"
228,3,What a mess,"I was shocked. The novel was so good and I don't see why they have to make a 2.5 hour movie for a novel as big as 800 pages. Not only many scenes were missing, the duals with the death eaters was awful. People flying every where and no real dueling with the wands for death eaters. They can glide as the dementors do... Oh I guess David Yates should be writing a new book instead. And the Dudley demented and a peck of owls chapters, it was complete mess! There was only one owl and the post was like a polite howler (really funny), and the acting of the artists on the screen was horrible. The occlumency classes were horrible and I did not like the dialog delivery myself. And the Sirius death and the emotions after that were real mess. It was cut short. And why was Kreacher present in the movie. His role was so cut short and I thought it was a waste of time. If J.K. Rowling wanted Kreacher to be there give the role some time on the screen. And finally Dumbledore's dual with Voldermort, this was as horrible as the other parts of the film. I wish the movie had been more than 3 hours. If this movie is like this I don't know what they make out of sixth book which I like it most of the series. I wish they don't make it as horrible as this part."
229,4,I was Disappointed,"It was no where near as bad as I had expected it to be. But this was the longest book and yet it was the shortest movie. I did not get that. Also the movie was way to rushed and it missed so many parts. The end was about 20 min and in the book it is like 200 pages, I was so disappointed. Although the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort was pretty cool. I thought that Tonks was done pretty well, but at first I was disappointed with Looney, however just her voice was creepy enough. As I said it was way too rushed and too many parts were left out, so I was disappointed, but I had originally thought it was going to be worse."
230,10,The darkest most serious & BEST Harry Potter to date,"First, let me say, I have not read any of the books in this series."
231,3,Truly Disappointing,"So while I wasn't amongst the insane group of fans that waited up for Midnight showings, I did wait in line today to see Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix with a lot of optimism and excitement based on my love of the book, the series, and some really great trailers."
232,1,They more then left stuff out,"If you love he book, wait 'til it comes out on DVD. There is a hard task of cutting an 870 page book down into a 2 hour movie, So it is understandable if some little things get left out. But some things were down right changed or weaken because of things being left out. People left out of this movie, Rita, victor. Things that were changed, Fred and George's products were not explained. It was never explained that they were starting a store with the seed money harry gave them. The fireworks they set off in the movie didn't damage the roof of hogwarts. They swamp they created and teachers, not fixing anything that the brothers did was left out. It seems like they are being written out of the movie. Umbridge's Fireplace seen is different then the book. The centaur is not brought in to teach divination. THe battle with that LV drastically changed, I mean this was a huge action scene in the book, no shield, no phoenix, and no statue. They should fire this director and get a new one."
233,5,Not as good as the others,"I was actually very disappointed in this movie. It did not seem to have the same chemistry between the actors as the previous movies. Many of the main characters only had bit parts. There was too much Harry and not enough of the others. What makes a movie great is all the subplots. The previous movies had them but not this one. It made for a long and almost boring in parts movie. The previous movies I have watched again and again. This one I fell asleep three times, and will probably not bother watching again. Sorry, I love the Harry Potter cast, just like to see more of the others and not all just Harry. This book was the longest book in the series so why did they make it the shortest movie in series? I agree about the acting of the main three being better. Radcliff has really improved. He is really putting emotion into acting now. A few subplots that involved the other actors would of improved this movie."
234,7,Middle of the Pack??,"This film feels more like a collage of scenes, a series of puzzle pieces, thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together, just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing is a big issue, leaving fans feeling disjointed, and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. Overall the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed, as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced, which I found odd, considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. There were numerous plot-holes which ruin the film for me as well. Despite the flaws, i find this film quite compelling and a pretty good film, and i believe that without the books, this film would have been heralded as a masterpiece. Many critics don't like this film because its not ""accurate"" to the books. As someone who doesn't care about that, i believe the film is a good one deserves to sit in the middle of the pack for me."
235,10,Harry Potter 5 Rocked,"The best by far. It had me shivering in the first scene and left me speechless in the last. A must see for the year 2007. Please do enjoy it. My dad, who hasn't read the books, loved it. It was by far one of the movies on my top ten list. The graphics were awesome. I LOVED the threstrals. Harry's hair....a bit disappointing but the movie made up for that. Kreacher was Amazing. He looked exactly like I had pictured him. Even comparing it to the book is possible. It beats the rest of the films by a long shot. I LOVED the Harry Cho kissing scene and the look and film of the characters and their surroundings gave me shivers. The small bit that Bella was in the movie was awesome and Voldemort's scene had me at the edge of my seat. Overall, a damn good movie."
236,6,Completely out of order,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a step up from Goblet of Fire but it's still a disappointing film as a Harry Potter film and especially compared to the first 3, it's a film with one of the slowest and messiest first 2 acts I've ever seen, with some of the most annoying character additions and an ending that really elevates it, almost every idea this film introduces is forgotten about."
237,2,not the best of the 5 but the worst of the 5.,"Now, first of all, I am NOT one of those picky people who expect too much in a movie.. (I found Fantastic Four one of the best movies ever.. and others seemed to have hated it...) but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not bearable at all."
238,10,I honestly don't understand why so much people dislike it...,"Yeah, I know, we met the worse character there, I mean, Umbridge, but it still remains magical and I love it!"
239,1,Worst movie of the series and this year thus far...,"I must admit that I had low expectations when I walked into the theater. Biggest book, shortest movie. But what the new screenwriter did to the book was even worse than I ever had imagined. The movie is so far away from the book that I thought I went to another totally wrong movie."
240,5,"Just Alright, weakest one of the lot so far","In terms of personal satisfaction, the books just keep getting better and better but the movies keep getting worse and worse. This one wasn't awful, but the Harry Potter magic did not translate well to the screen."
241,6,disappointed,"well ... went to the cinema today all geared up with ma friend .. who is, like me a huge harry potter fanatic."
242,6,Naughty children deserve to be punishedHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"For starters, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was by far my least favorite book in the series. Not much happens until the end, which is actually pretty good, there is a lot of repetition through the beginning of the story, and Harry's adolescent anger and temper just get plain annoying. After enjoying how the fourth book was adapted onto film, I was hoping we'd get more of the same here with a distilled version where main plot is paramount and the detentions and acting out cut down immensely. At first I thought I was going to be very happy. The film starts off great with Dudley and Harry in the London playground where the Dementors attack. Just having a sequence in a Potter film outdoors and not at Hogwarts was a welcome sight and everything pretty much went as planned. There were some exclusions when the boys arrived back home, most noticeably the absence of Mundungus, but I was willing to look past them. Even in the early time at Hogwarts, Potter has one outburst of anger and it seems that would be it. I was ready to ease into the tale and enjoy the ride, but that comfortability never occurred. "
243,10,"Less awesome than the previous two, maintains the high level","With an admirable effort to condense all the essential to make the shortest Harry Potter movie yet, but still finding the time to develop both intertwined plots (Harry maturing as a man and Good vs. Evil)"
244,10,Condensed Version,"I am a great fan of the books and the movies. My favorite movies are Order of the Phoenix and Prisoner of Azkaban. The first two movies are okay, better for smaller children, but seem to be propelled too much by Chris Colombus's simplistic view of the Potter world."
245,10,Amazing!!!!The Best Movie of the Year by Far!!!!!,"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan,having read every book and seen every movie countless times.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has always been,in my opinion,the weakest of the books so I was very worried about the movie before seeing it,but I was very wrong."
246,4,Disappointment,The Order of the Phoenix movie was horrible. I have never been more disappointed with something to do with Harry Potter.
247,7,An average Harry Potter,"Not as good as the previous entries, but a stepping stone toward the darker movies of the series. Some good moments throughout but I felt like there was less character advancement in this one."
248,4,Order of the Pheonix by name only....,"This movie was absolutely terrible in my personal opinion. As a fan of the book series, I felt I deserved much more that what was delivered to me for my $8.50. There were too many problems to name, so I'll throw a few out there. 1. The first Harry Potter book was just over 300 pages in length. The movie was roughly 152 minutes according to the DVD in front of me at this moment. The fifth book was 870 pages. The movie was, according to IMDb, ""Runtime: 138 min "". Anyone else notice a problem with this? I certainly did. So much more could have been done. 2. Things in the book did not make it into the movie. This would normally be OK. This kind of thing happens all of the time in movies. The problem I have? Things were added in that were not from the book. When it comes to what should and should not be in the movie, parts from the book should be the first thing added in, not taken away. 3. Not only were things missing, but some major things were missing. Members of the Order (from the book) made no appearances what so ever. Those who made the cut played little role. Quidditch played no role in the film while it played quite a bit into the book. What about Ron's problems with Quidditch? The movie focused purely on Harry, and not on the supporting characters. 4. Mixing and matching. The major points that were from the book appeared in a different order in the film as compared to the movie. Scenes that occurred around the middle of the book occurred early in the movie. Some parts from the book were moved around. "
249,7,Pretty good book to film transfer,"I went to the press screening past Friday. I wasn't expecting too much. I only saw the first 2 movies, and I didn't think they were that great. The books are just much better. But I must say, this fifth movie is pretty good. But the biggest part of criticism I have on this title is that they left too much out. I understand that the book just has way too many subplots to put in the film. But still it's a shame. Like the relationship between Harry and Cho. They only appear together in only 2 scenes!"
250,9,Love It! But wish it was longer,"I saw the movie on the premiere. It was great, but why was it only about 2 hours, couldn't they at least stretch it to 2 hours and 30 minute?"
251,6,Cant help but compare it to the book,If you are going to base films on books you have to be prepared for comparisons!!! Phoenix is my favourite of the Harry Potter books books but I must admit that this movie is my least favourite.
252,,Harry Potter,"With the end of the last Harry Potter movie (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) being so tear jerking, you should brace yourself for darker themes in this movie. We will lose a most beloved character in this one and be introduced to the most hated person of all time. There is not a soul in this world that doesn't hat Umbridge, in facts in many polls she surpasses Voldemort himself to attain her title of most hated character ever. With the return of Voldemort in the last book things were bound to get tough for Harry but this movie is not about the good versus bad. It's about the love and the effect of war on the people we love. It's a story of the struggle that Harry Potter faces as the boy who lived. It's a brilliant watch like the rest of the Harry Potter movies. It's a must watch movie for everyone. Be sure you watch the previous movies thought to understand it. This movie was suggested by Flickstree site which i think is awesome."
253,4,room for improvement,"This is the first of Potter films of which I felt I'd have done well to have read the book so that I could be let into the story more fully. The earlier movies, for all their faults, entertained me on their own terms, whereas with this one I was aware of time ticking by, so I was clearly not engrossed in it. What remains of an unquestionably high standard is the seemingly never-ending supply of excellent UK actors. Imelda Staunton makes a contribution that would be outstanding in any movie: I hope she wins recognition for it when the awards come around. There is also some engaging work from the youngsters: Daniel Radcliffe has become a good young actor - perhaps unsurprising, considering he's been able to learn from the very best. Unfortunately, Emma Watson's gifts seem to be travelling in the opposite direction: she is effortlessly outshone by newcomer Evanna Lynch.Or maybe Hermione is just a duller role."
254,10,By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!,"I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it! "
255,,"A good Harry Potter movie, part of the series.","OK, look, I'm a 62-year-old grandpa, and long ago gave up keeping track of all the story lines in these movies. I enjoyed the first one most, because it introduced me to the characters and the fantasy world that they are in. So I no longer try to keep track of everything, I just sit back and enjoy what I see on the screen."
256,6,Good but confusing,"First the good: This movie had great special effects, especially the fight scene at the end with Dumbledoor and Voldemort. I also liked most of the performances, especially some of the newer characters (Delores and Luna)."
257,6,"A bit rushed, but still fantastic","My biggest complaint is that it felt too rushed. It did a great job of keeping everything that was needed and getting rid of all the excess, but I felt it needed time to slow down and breathe. This is especially noticeable at the end - the final battle is so well-done and so exciting that I wished it could have been longer. Sirius' death was also botched because it was too quick; there was no real emotional impact. The music is basically a non-factor - I noticed its absence more than its presence, especially because some scenes could have really used it in the background. And, as always, a lot of the characters get the shaft, but I've come to expect that."
258,6,The Trouble With Harry,"I haven't read one single word of the Harry Potter saga; I did see the first film and thought it okay but not much more. On the other hand I get withdrawal symptoms if I don't see at least one movie a week and this week - the new films open here on Fridays - the pickings were pretty lean so I figured this couldn't be that bad and I was right. It's not that bad but then neither is it extra special, at least not to one who has never read the books and therefore needs help in figuring out the back story. By far the best elements for me were those satirizing the English Education system because it's quite a trick to satirize something that doesn't exist thanks to Tony Blair. On the other hand I have no doubt at all that Potter buffs will find much to enjoy and applaud here so far be it for me to rain on their parade."
259,5,Who Framed Harry Potter?,"Although he was clearly acting in self-defense, neatly hair-trimmed Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is expelled from ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" - but, he is readmitted after a trial. All along, Mr. Radcliffe insists the evil Lord Voldemort has returned from the abyss, but ""the powers that be"" don't believe him. It's looks like it's getting increasingly difficult giving each of the growing ""Potter"" supporting characters screen time, but it's still sad to see one of them die (as advertised)."
260,10,Potter Pots Gold,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a Harry Potter fanatic, at sixteen years old I'm at the perfect age to truly appreciate the series. I started to reading the books when they first came out and I was instantly hooked, I think I was about six or seven when the original book came out, and now ten years on and now five of the seven movies have been made and the final (and in my eyes best) book has just been released. So in short I have grown up with this series, and in some respects the characters have grown up with me. However, in my opinion I always found Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book of the series. Sure its still brilliant and has its moments, but after the high of Goblet of Fire I just felt Order was lacking something truly magic. It seemed overlong, a bit boring and just filling in the gaps until the final two books. I was expecting Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest movie as a result of this, however due to a great bit of cutting out the unnecessary bits of the book, Order of the Phoenix ends up being in my eyes the very best Potter movie to date! Now I also understand this will be a bit controversial with many people watching the movie, as I was sitting watching this I realised that if you are not a fan of the books or have not read the books I wasn't certain those people would truly appreciate the film. In some respects Order of the Phoenix is the most fan friendly of the series and doesn't rely on an overdose of CGI like the other movies. This one actually has a hell of a lot of talking going on, in fact up until the huge fight in the Ministry of Magic, there isn't a whole lot of action at all. What Phoenix does instead is develop interesting characters, show the plot to its full potential and deliver some great moments in the series."
261,8,The most bold and daring Harry Potter movie as of yet.,"Lots of people at the time praised ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" for its dark approach and atmosphere. Well, if ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a dark movie, than this is an ultra-dark movie. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a semi-dark children/fantasy movie that never really dared to cross the line. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not afraid to this though. I must say that this movie is actually closer to horror than fantasy in my opinion. It had an incredible atmosphere, with also some classic build up horror moments. There is little room left for fun in this movie and it's all very serious. Yes, perhaps a bit too serious though. I felt that the movie could had used some relieving humor at times, something all of the other Harry Potter movies were still loaded with."
262,6,It's as though all the happiness has gone from the world of Harry Potter...,Must be the Dementors' fault.
263,8,one of the best Harry Potters yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has a gripping main story involving the continuing peril for Harry and his arch nemesis, the dark lord Voldermort (Fiennes, as sinister as possible), but what surprised me a little was seeing that there's even a kind of political subtext to the story at Hogwarts. This is personified by the ministry's new professor-cum-control freak Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), who teaches theory instead of practice, and is every ultra-harsh, practically laughable disciplinarian you've ever had the horror to have over your heads. Odd for some other ""kids"" movies (save for Happy Feet), but for the Harry Potter universe the foreboding presence of the ministry makes the feeling of the dread that Potter has to face that much more pronounced, as a feeling of helplessness spreads out amongst everyone in the society despite the message from the messenger that 'everything's fine'. Staunton is perfect in the role of Umbridge, and helps to make the character as part of the ranks of those played by Alan Rickman (?), Gary Oldman (not really), and Ralph Fiennes (for sure) as one of the most dastardly figures in the Potter universe. Though she may even be more chilling, even as a momentary figure, because of what she represents for those who need to practice magic first hand."
264,4,By far the worst movie in the series,THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE READ ALL THE BOOKS.
265,2,Poor Harry Potter. Poor J.K. Rowling.,"Don't get me wrong: I absolutely loved J.K. Rowlings books about the little orphan boy trying to accept his past and his future in a ruff world coated with magic. It is probably exactly that; the care and detail in which Rowling describes her characters, their emotional world and experiences, which have made even the grown ups standing in line for each new Potter release. Naturally it is not easy to reflect the incredibly detailed books in an approx. 2 hours length film. Despite this the first and second movie managed to capture the enchantment the concerning books mediated and the viewers were plunged into the dreams and hopes of Harry Potter and his friends and their adventures in a wizard society located in a muggles world. The third movie reflected the growing pains of HP and the other main characters, which are really the main issue in Rowlings books, very well and managed to spellbind the audience once again. The little children had given way to the young adults they where bound to grow into facing the world as it is, magic or no magic. Still, the movie, and the book, contained a great portion of humor and made it real treat for the public."
266,7,What;s all the Criticism On this Film!!!??!!,"The first three Harry Potter films were directed with pure brilliance. The fourth was good, but the fifth film was everyone's big question. When I watched this film, I found it amazing. Later, I realized all the criticism on this film. I can't find what's wrong with the movie."
267,2,Not happy at all!,"Yes, the images were great, yes the movie had its moments, but overall, I was extremely disappointed and upset! Yes, it was a long book to cut down and fit in to two hours, but to completely change things??? To bring in things that didn't occur AT ALL in the book? If you have not read the books, then enjoy, I am sure it would be brilliant however it may be hard to follow, as nothing is really explained. Some of the changes work positively, upon reflection, but others clash with events in the Half Blood Prince, which if this goes ahead as a movie, the screenwriter will have one tough job ahead to make things right. See it, by all means. Fans of the book will understand this post once they have seen what I have. Shame shame shame."
268,3,Overrated!,"Are you kidding me? After years of inspiring books and movies that keep getting better, the Harry Potter franchise has finally hit a snag."
269,7,"Yates, Goldenberg and Hooper try, but come up short with Order","When I think of the great fantasy movie franchises I think of two of the greatest: Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Both (in my humble opinion) excelled due to one crucial element: continuity. Unfortunately, for the Harry Potter movies this element is lacking, and as a result the franchise suffers."
270,7,"Longest Book, Shortest film...you find the logic!!??","If you were to read my previous review on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you will note that I entered into a rather long diatribe on the fact that due to the Harry Potter books growing in length, subsequent movies will have to outgrow the confines of a mere two hour movie for them to prove true to the original text and have any credibility at all to the Harry Potter Legend."
271,3,Did not live up on any level,This movie did not live up to any of the hype that the trailer or the book created.
272,3,Another Flop,"I grew up reading these books. It got me through the boring days at school, thinking of what J.K. Rowling was going to write next. As the series went on I got more and more excited. My mom and I would always be at Borders at midnight, screaming for the next book. However, this movie has destroyed the magic spun so delicately by Rowling. The movies kept forgetting little details, and switching directors each movie has screwed this series up royally. The lack of attention to detail is abundant and was completely ignored so they could spit the movies out and make it easier for the people who are too lazy to read the books. This movie, at the beginning, was on a good track, leading everyone into the story as Harry Potter once again arrives at Hogwarts. But as the movie began to climb toward the climax, the film steadily declined. The storyline unwound, the characters and plot didn't make sense, and the messy attention to detail showed."
273,3,The Movie barely followed the book!!,"I do not understand how so much of the book could have been changed. It seemed like the writer and director just tried to create their own story line and only used a few bits and pieces from the book. For instance (don't read if you do not want to know details from the movie): 1) Ron and Hermione are not selected as Prefects in the movie. Prefects are supposed to be chosen during the fifth year. Percy, Ron's older brother, was Prefect. 2) When Professor Trelawney was fired Dumbledore brought Firenze, a centaur, as the new divination Professor. Firenz working for the Humans puts the other centaurs in an uproar (none of this was in the movie). 3) Neville Longbottom never found the room of requirement. It was Dobby that told Harry about the Room. 4) The prophecy never spoke to Harry. The prophesy got broken during the fighting and only Dumbledore knew what it really said."
274,7,Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens."
275,8,"The Darkness is its Strength, not its weakness","---Most likely not real spoilers, but just in case---------------------"
276,10,Order of the Phoenix - Best Potter Yet!,"I saw the first Harry Potter film amidst a flurry of criticism that kids were being taught ""Witchcraft"" through these stories. Highly Unlikely, and rubbish. I guess the purple Teletubby is also gay and evil, as is Barney the Dinosaur. J.K. Rowling has created something that most American moviegoers do not grasp very well- English Humour and Morals. These movies show that anything can be used for bad, or good, whether it is ""magic"" or Technology- And are an encouragement for kids to always use any advantages they have to do the right thing. Therefore, the Jerry-Fallwellian idea that kids are badly influenced by the Potter series must be discarded."
277,,"Dark, professional, engaging and enjoyable","Another year begins for Harry with more challenges than ever. The Ministry seem intent on having him expelled and it is only some timely interventions that save him  but they come at a cost to those involved. Back at Hogwarts proper and changes are afoot with the addition to the teaching staff of Professor Delores Umbridge as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge's refusal to actually teach the class sees Harry and his friends secretly practicing themselves but cannot stop her rise to power, displacing Dumbledore. This all occurs while the shadow of Voldemort looms over Harry's life."
278,8,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"I will admit that by this point the films may have become just a little dark for the younger members in the audience, but this fifth instalment in the series is never the less, as with the others, great viewing. Basically Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) are attacked near Privet Drive by two Dementors, forcing the young wizard to summon the Patronus charm, but of course spells are forbidden by young wizards in the Muggle world. So he is devastated to be told he has been expelled, but he is going to the wizard court in the Ministry of Magic to plead his case, with the help of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) and other members of the society called the Order of the Pheonix. After being cleared of the charges, he is allowed to go back to Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and they also meet student Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), seen at Harry's hearing, and appointed by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy). The Ministry do not believe the claims that Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned, and Umbridge is severely punishing Harry by forcing him to write with a cursed quill, carving the words ""I must not tell lies"" onto his hand. Her control over the school grows and grows as more rules are brought in on behalf of her and the Ministry, and she is not even teaching the students the right spells and skills in the Dark Arts classes that they will need to fight off any threat coming. Therefore Harry, Ron and Hermoine, along with many other rebellious students, find the secret Room of Requirement that can be hidden away, and they use to become ""Dumbledore's Army"" and train their skills, with Harry as teacher. While Dumbledore seems to distance himself from Harry, and he and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) develop romantic feelings that leads to a kiss under the mistletoe, Harry also experiences more nightmares seeing a dark room full of shiny globe prophecies, dark forces attacking Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), so Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) trains him to block out these dark thoughts. The Dark Lord meanwhile is slowly gathering his army, realising nine Death Eaters and Sirius's deranged cousin Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), known to have killed the parents of Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), from Azkaban prison. After discovering ""Dumbledore's Army"" and Dumbledore himself escaping arrest, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress, and things fall apart even more, until a revolt finally comes in the form of the Weasley twins Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps) causing chaos during an exam with fireworks and flying papers. After this Umbridge threatens the illegal Cruciatus Curse on Harry unless they reveal their intentions, but Hermoine tricks her to follow them into the Dark Forest where the brother of Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Grawp, and the herd of centaurs get rid of her. Seeing a vision, Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Luna, Neville, and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) fly to the Ministry of Magic, where Sirius was last seen, and find the Department of Mysteries where thousands of prophecies are kept, including the one revealing truths about Voldermort and Harry's fates. Dumbledore's Army end up in a small fight against the Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) when he does not get the prophecy they want, and all are eventually caught and threatened to be killed unless Harry hands it over. Just when he does give it to Malfoy all the Order of the Phoenix, including Nymphadora Tonks (Natalia Tena), Kingsley Shacklebolt (Raiders of the Lost Ark's George Harris),Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), and Professor Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) show up to join the fight, the prophecy is destroyed accidentally, but in the process of battle Bellastrix Lestrange manages to kill Sirius, and Voldermort shows up before she can be tortured by Harry. Dumbledore shows up to have a quick battle with the Dark Lord, and before vanishing he quickly possesses Harry's body in the hope of killing him as well, but the love inside the young wizard overpowers and he leaves his body. In the end Fudge and all the Ministry accept that Voldermort has indeed returned, the school returns to form, Dumbledore explains the distancing was because of their connection, and Harry accepts that the prophecy is that he or Voldermort will kill each other in the end. Also starring Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney and Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick. The casting is spot on, with the young actors still giving great performances, but also the new addition of Staunton normally really nice characters but here actually quite sinister as the Nurse Ratched style teacher, the action is exciting, and as always the special effects really engage you and take you into this magical world, a terrific family fantasy fantasy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
279,7,"Still a great deal of fun, but less captivating than previous installments","With each new film, the Harry Potter franchise gets darker and more mature, perhaps also to reflect the fact that the audience has grown up along with the characters. ""Darker"", however, is not synonymous with ""better"", in fact Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the least accomplished entry in the series so far."
280,1,where to begin?,"alrighty then. Really, where to begin? There were so many things wrong with this film, they were way off the plot in the book. so many things they didn't put in from the book, or made up things that weren't in the book. they need to find a decent director and stick with them...because Yates just isn't doing his job very well at all, one thing i did notice about 2/3 or 3/4 through the movie, Hermione found harry and Ron, and she said ""hagrid is back!""..the only problem with that was that they NEVER mentioned that he was gone, or if they did i was asleep. there was no quidditch, which was a huge disappointment for me because quidditch is a part of harry and the action of the games make the movie experience better. the fight in the department of mysteries was done very badly if you ask me. when exactly did the ""evil"" characters start floating around being followed by tails of dark smoke, and the ""good"" characters having bright lights underneath them at all times? and Voldemort flying without a broom? i don't recall that from the book, but yet again maybe i am mistaken. I hated this movie, it was by far the worst ""adaptation"" yet. it was very choppy, and i told people that if they hadn't read the book..that they wouldn't understand what is happening. so much left out, could have been a lot better, David Yates...you should look into a different field of work. 'nuff said"
281,1,What the hell?,"This movie, by far, has been the WORST movie yet. Everything was left out! I was very disappointed in this movie. I almost went back to the store and demanded my money back! You left out OVER half of the book and didn't even give correct details. Professor Umbridge DID NOT get the information about Dumbledore's Army (D.A.) from Cho. She got it from her friends. And they were not all in the Room of Requirement when this information was acquired. This was a disgrace to Harry Potter fans. I for one, hope that the next two movies will contain more and accurate details. But it will not make up for what a horrible job you did on this one. You would have been better off not making it in the first place. I do hope you re make the movie. But I doubt anyone will buy that one after what they saw this time. I am highly disappointed."
282,7,No.,"I'm crazy about the Harry Potter books, which can make my comment a little bias, since the book is usually better than the movie. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite Potter book and my least favorite Potter movie. I hated the pace of the movie. It tried to give the audience too much information at once. I was able to follow since I have read the books, but my friends and my family who haven't read the book did not understand much. I believe that the director is the very important in a film, because if the director sucks so does the actor. David Yates is not horrible but I don't think he has a great idea about the Harry Potter world. To me Harry Potter is much more magical and deep. I also think that the movie is way too dark. I understand that the book is also dark but this was just unpleasant. The adult actors were all amazing as usual, especially Umbridge. Daniel Radcliffe is not bad, neither is Emma Watson and Rupert Grint."
283,6,"Fun, Fast-Moving, But Slightly Stilted And Doom-Laden Harry Potter Adventure","Harry Potter's fifth term at Hogwarts is marred by his dread that the evil Voldemort is abroad and assembling dark forces, and a rift between the wizards who believe Harry and the Ministry of Magic, which insists there is nothing to fear. Worse, the sadistic Dolores Umbridge is appointed as a new teacher and sets out to make the pupils lives a misery ..."
284,10,'Phoenix' Casts Its Spell,"SYNOPSIS: Harry Potter and co. discover The Order of the Phoenix, a secret society bent on stopping the Dark Lord's reign of terror. Meanwhile, the students of Hogwarts grapple with an oppressive new female teacher, Dolores Umbridge. PROS: This is quite simply the film of the summer. Director David Yates fits this series like a glove. He pulls no punches when delivering the darker aspects of the story, but makes sure to add plenty of humor and heart as well. The cast is uniformly excellent as usual. Old hands like Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are note-perfect in their roles, while newcomers like Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter deliver memorable performances as well. Deserving special mention is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge, a perky professor with dark political motivations. In a film with a cast for the ages, she steals the show. The behind the scenes crew isn't slacking off either-cinematography, music, and special effects are all leaps and bounds ahead of the previous Potter films. And screenwriter Michael Goldenberg trims the fat of the 870-page book, leaving us with a lean, mean, emotional roller-coaster of a film. CONS: No huge qualms. Sure, some fan favorites (Dobby) are dropped, but when you have a book this big, who cares. My only really (very small) problem with the film is that the Mr. Weasley subplot could have used a bit more time. Overall, the best of all five Potter flicks, and a fantasy film on par with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. David Yates is the best thing ever to happen to the HP series. Bravo."
285,9,The Rebellion Begins,"As another year begins for Harry, at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry so does the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry's account on Voldemort's return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge. As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students at Hogwarts they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they'll never be ready for the outside world."
286,1,Ummmm . . . no! Bad director!,"Jeez. I was supremely disappointed with this film. Did anyone else walk out of the theatre going, ""Where was Peeves?"" Granted, they didn't include the poltergeist in any of the previous films, but in the previous books, his role is minimal at best. In Order of the Phoenix, he is a major player against the ministry's controlling influence at Hogwarts: Umbridge. Now, I liked the fight in the Department of Mysteries, don't get me wrong. Maybe some of the people who liked this film have lower standards than myself, but I am of the most sincere opinion that if you're going to make a book into a movie, that you should include every single minuscule detail. Turn the book into a movie, so to speak, instead of merely ""adapting"" the book like so many do. Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix disappointed me beyond anything I could have foreseen."
287,7,Solid entertainment and well-laid foundations for a grande finale,"Yes people, it really is well worth seeing this film. For starters, it's totally Quidditch-free. Instead it offers darkly atmospheric spookiness and cleverly executed special effects. The real charm of this film is in the cameo roles. Natalia Tena is a little bit gorgeous as the tomboyish Nymphadora Tonks. Alan Rickman's Snape is magnificent as ever. Helena Bonham Carter virtually steals the movie in her tantalising few minutes on screen as the psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange. Imelda Staunton's relentless, sadistic and pink-clad Dolores Umbridge rules Hogwarts with an iron fist. Filch and Kreacher contribute a few well-judged sneers, and Mark Williams makes a pleasingly eccentric Arthur Weasley. It is extremely pleasant to see a gruff and masculine Rupert Grint just for once, and a low profile, chilled out Emma Watson. Admittedly Daniel Radcliffe's performance leaves something to be desired and Gary Oldman is surprisingly bland. However the parts add up to a pleasing whole, and the foundations are well laid for Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. 7/10"
288,10,I hate umbridge,All harry potter films are a 11/10 in my eyes but this one is a 9 because Umbridge does my head in i wanna throw a brick at her head everytime i watch this movie
289,9,One of the best Potter films yet,"I wasn't sure whether slightly inexperienced director David Yates could pull it off; after all, he is an unknown. I wasn't sure whether I would like such a short movie adapted from such a long book. Granted, the movie could've been a little better, but I was satisfied with it, and by the end, I was ready to see it all over again."
290,8,Something Wicked This Way Comes,"Ask any long running television series cast how the show differed from beginning to end and they will all have the same answer: character dynamics. This movie was a reflection of just that. We have seen, since the first movie, these three actors become closer and more aware of the other's acting styles. In this film, that awareness shines through magnificently. We see comfortable actors. No longer are they the children we saw in the first few movies that seemed to be thrust together, acting hard to create false relationships. We see dynamics, people working off each other, people settling down into their magical niche. This allowed--of course--for the magic, that was intended to flow through every scene, to explode like Fred&George's firecrackers. The movie, itself was quite extraordinary (as it should be), packed full of priceless characters portrayed by uniquely successful actors (i.e. Imelda Staunton as Umbridge) and special effects that will have you cowering in your seat. 'Phoenix' delves into the dark side of this magical world and presents the evil that lies within both the main villain and the hero himself. Radcliffe does an impressive job during his scenes of intense pain and scrutiny, truly leading you to believe that he is suffering. Yet all of his efforts to seem shut off from the world are outshone by the lovely youngster Evanna Lynch who plays the aptly nicknamed 'Loony Lovegood'. Her melodious, vacant voice adds perfectly to this misunderstood character. Without anyone's knowledge it was this little part that kept the audiences intrigue, wondering when she would show up next. I'm much looking forward to seeing her in the next films. To end I say: David Yates' love for minimalist acting and staging paid off in these scenes, capturing the inner characteristics of each person in the movie (ex. After the Cho Kiss) and it also allowed for every battle and high tension moment to double in its hysteria and panic. I applaud this movie and I much enjoyed it."
291,9,Magic,"I can still remember the thrill of reading my first Harry Potter book. I was slow starter - the first three books were already out by then. What made the books so enthralling was that the magic was presented matter-of-fact and without fanfare which made it at once seem all the more believable and more exciting. While I haven't disliked any of the films and actually enjoyed parts of all them, this is the first Harry Potter movie that made me feel the magic all over again. Yes, there will be a lot of complaints about what was left out, but what was put in was way more important. For the first time, parts of the film are actually subtle and give you pause for thought. A single glance conveys the information from many pages of text. The cast is as fine as usual, but Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge) is brilliant!"
292,6,Not a film for younger children,"I must admit that I've never read any of the Potter books, so i've therefore got no great allegiance to the franchise. I expected the movies to be aimed at a very much younger audience, but to my mind these films (after the first two instalments) aren't really suitable for younger children. I have found the darker tones of the films quite interesting and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movies."
293,4,Amateurish and lame,"I hated this film deeply when it was released, today I decided I'd give it another go - alas, I still hate this film - even more than before. The reasons: 1) 'I feel more lonely than ever before'; 'I am sorry for you, cos you never knew love and friendship'; 'We've got something to fighting for' - these are just three lines the script writer (or whoever decided to put them into Harry's mouth) should be hanged, drawn and quartered. Or, at least, publicly ridiculed - for they transformed the Harry JKR wrote into Percy Weasley, for only Percy could've said these lines - cheesy, false and vomit-inducing. 2) I suspect David Yates loves Stanley Kubrick movies, especially The Shining (two little girls scene - immobile, in the centre of the frame) - for he used this approach to framing just too many times while shooting this film (and the subsequent Potter films shot by different DoPs, so it's definitely the director's fault.) While it's certainly served its purpose in the S Kubrick films, continuous usage of the same approach in HP is maddening, to say the least - it just destroys the natural flow of the narration! 3) Dolores Umbridge treatment - instead of pure evil (as described by JKR both in the book and in the subsequent interviews), Yates & Goldenberg made her quite an average power-loving bureaucrat, nothing special (conveniently forgetting the fact it was her who sent the Dementors to Harry) 4) Music - it seems disconnected from the narration and sometimes inappropriate (like re-using the Escaping from Privet Drive track for end credits. 5) Continuity & lack of logic: for ex., how come the Occlumency scene was put before Harry & Weasley's leaving Hogwarts for Grimmauld Place? Why did Sirius give Harry that Order of the Phoenix photograph at the station? It should've happened earlier. 6) Unnecessary 'heavy' special effects, like apparition of the Grimmauld Place house (making it appear like JKR described it would've been much more effective and cheaper to boot.) 7) Dialogues (in addition to what I wrote about those infamous Harry lines) - it seems like the scriptwriter took some of the lines directly from the book, but didn't bother (or just was unable) to make them sound logical in the context of the film, which resulted in, for ex., Umbridge's speech at the beginning-of-the-year feast (and Ron's reaction to it) stupid and illogical. "
294,9,Rather (Love)Good Film,"I've been to a lot of blockbusters lately - Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, Die Hard 4. But Harry Potter 5 was the first one whose line actually busted a block; going all the way around it by the time the doors opened for the 10:15 show at the Senator. I figured this show wouldn't be as hectic as the midnight showing, but since this was the first day the film was out, I should have known better. This was no ordinary line of moviegoers, either. Nearly half of them were sporting the usual magical garb."
295,4,easily the worst of the harry potter films,"rushed, chaotic and nonsensical (if you've not read the book). the editing is awful and the script is worse. went in with lowered expectations and were still disappointed. they seem to have taken all the connecting threads of the plot out and focused on the less important aspects of the core story. this movie could have been great in competent hands. instead, we get no character development, no idea of what's going on, no slowly building rebellion against umbridge, no tension and a particularly anti-climatic battle against death-eaters. in fact, you never really feel like harry and his friends are in danger in the ministry. you feel like, if harry hands over the prophecy, they will actually let them go. instead of killing them."
296,7,Decent Readers' Digest Version (but Bring Back Columbus and Continuity Checkers!),"Potter fans rejoice (if only moderately): the latest installment in the film saga comes closer to the high standard of film adaptation set by the *first* two films than the last two over praised ""mooovie-movies,"" even if in the slapdash ""best of the highlights"" approach the latest director takes (despite attention lavished on the big fight scenes near the end), we only have a decent Readers' Digest Potter with the bones of the plot and little if any of the motivations or substance - or even locations we have come to know and love. "
297,5,Not a great movie.,"Overall, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not a great movie."
298,5,Not at all magical!,I arrived at the special imax screening of this movie at 3a.m. well before time-at 1a.m.There was already a big crowd gathered.Not to watch the movie but to get the best seats in the house for this was a so called 3D presentation.I only found out after i got my ticket that only the last 20mins of the movie was the 3D part.But was it worth watching the rest o the movie for this bit??I don't think so. Weak performances all round and the most noticeable fact was the total lack of music throughout the movie.I was always able to hear someone eating their popcorn or slurping on their soda and thats when i realised this little oddity.The only good thing bout the movie was that it was not too long and has been edited well.The special effects leave much to be desired.All in all it was just an average movie from which i didn't expect much and i guess it pretty much lived up to the expectation.Nothing big releasing for a while now i guess.Transformers and 300 have definitely been Hollywood's high points this year(yet to watch ratatouille). Let me just make this one thing clear.The only reason i'm giving this movie a 5 is because i gave spiderman 3 a 3on10 and HP was definitely better than spiderman3. Its not worth wasting the dough on the imax 3D screening cos there isn't anything great.I don't recommend the movie but its still OK if there's no other movie to watch.
299,9,Worst Potter Movie.,"My 10 hour wait in line was ended in disappointment. From the first 5 min.s I could tell this wasn't going to be a very good movie. If you compare this movie to all of the others in the series, it has a completely different feel. It felt like a rough draft. Nothing transitioned well. The actual film footage was fantastic, but the way they placed it together made it hard to follow and very rocky. Don't even get me started on the fight scene and death. It was so short. 5 secs: Arrived. 5 secs: Looked. 5 secs: Fought. 5 secs: Death. 5 secs: Fight. 10 secs: Harry on the floor. I know there was a lot to put into this movie, and they accomplished getting all the main events, but it was just not put together properly. I think even 10 min more would have made this film so much better. The best way I can put it: They seem to have sent it out the rough draft. "
300,6,Harry Potter... You will lose... everything.,I actually got the opportunity to see this today and was mesmerized by the increasing maturity of the movies in the series. It actually was more of an adult film that the previous ones and makes me think that we are in for a treat with the next two.
301,2,Highly Disappointed!,"I have to admit, the much anticipated, long awaited Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix movie was a major disappointment. Especially considering that I had re-read the novel recently to re-familiarize myself with the story line. It's funny that the longest book in the series produced the shortest movie, and while the fifth was my least favorite book, I had some expectations for the movie..."
302,4,Lacks structure and pace. Mr. Yates needs to brush up on his interpretation skills.,"Be it the first or the last season, but excluding the third, with Harry and his friends at Hogwarts, this years school term feels exactly the same as the previous terms. This year we see a much drawn-out affair that takes great pains to expel any adventure and fun, yes, fun. For the same messages that we have become accustomed to, such as Harry's parents, Lord Voldemort's so-called appearance and his good-time older friends treating him as the child that they, and we too, still see him as, is no fun to watch any longer. He really does need to become more assertive and independent, this does happen in a tiny moment, but it seems more tantrum and transcendence."
303,6,"Reading this will save you time and money, stick to the books and save yourself from the disappointment","Firstly I would like to state that I am a huge fan of the books, as well as the films, even though some of the previous film installments could have been much better they were still enjoyable to watch. However in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg took the deepest Harry Potter book and made an absolute mockery of it. It felt as if David Yates was terrified by how much story there was in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he simply didn't know what to do with it. So, in order to compress this story into a mere 2 hour and 18 minutes, Yates cuts more story lines from the OotP than you can imagine and the ones he leaves are either constricted and rewritten or done with mini-montages adding to the lacking connection to the book. There are no transitions in this film whatsoever leaving no representation of time passing other than when Christmas comes. This also causes the viewer to feel as if they miss numerous parts of the movie as the scenes jump sporadically. With this film being so ridiculously short, the characters that we have grown accustomed to reading and seeing are barely visible throughout the film. This causes OotP to lack the ""Hogwarts"" feel that the other films possessed which allowed viewers to feel they were a part of what was happening on screen. Nearly all of the scenes that made this story relatable were cut, such as moments at Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. This takes the teenage amusement out of the story. It Prevents the trio from encountering their adolescent troubles with the absence of these scenes. Almost less amusing are the action scenes in this film. They are brief and left me yawning in my seat as it too strayed from the books. Though I would love nothing more to sit here and go into these matters further, this film has already wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life and I wish to waste no more by writing about it. In short it felt like I was watching a hastily assembled Michael Bay film, but without any stylized action to keep me mildly entertained. This film was poorly constructed and had no finesse. Not only was this the worst installment of the Harry Potter film franchise, it was one of the most disappointing and despicable attempts at film-making I have ever seen."
304,7,good entry in the series,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  the name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but it's one of the more entertaining films I've seen so far this summer. Since I've read the book, it's a little hard for me to judge how good this movie would be for me if I had not read it. But all in all I found it more entertaining and convincing than the 4th film, not quite as good as the 3rd. It really seems like the more the filmmakers try to avoid slavish devotion to the books the better they are as films."
305,3,Disappointment.,"If they were going to chop up the whole book and use bits and pieces, then why didn't they use the correct story line? In the movie, all the events half were factual and half were fiction. Like for instance, the part where they met Luna -- they met her in the train in the book, but in the movie they met her when they were headed towards Hogwarts. I know they did it with the other movies, but this being the longest book, it should have had more parts into it. It was interesting, but I had hoped it would be much longer and much more detailed, based upon the book. Like, them cleaning up Sirus house, they spent so much time in his house in the book, but they barely showed that. Plus the Quidditch match, and Ron being on the team. I would have loved to see that."
306,8,disappointing but it has it's moments,"The fifth chapter in the Harry Potter books and film Order of the Phoenix was the weakest of the five films to date for many reasons: the book version was too long and dragged in certain parts, the movie version felt too short and too many gaps that left a lot of unanswered questions. First, I will start off by saying what I didn't like about the film: returning cast members Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, Brendon Glesson, and Julie Walters were completely underused. Other things I didn't like was some of the unanswered question like Percy alienating himself from his parents due to his beliefs of Fudge and the Ministry, Very little between the Harry and Cho relationship even though Daniel Radcliffe and Katie Leung are great kissers. Vernon's resentment of Harry was not shown, Petunia' feelings towards Harry and her sister were not mentioned. Trewlaney 's prediction of the Prophecy was not shown, Ron's qudditch scenes were cut, no mention of Ron and Hermione being prefects in the film. Fred and George's frustration of Hogwarts was not show even though their escape was seen.No mention of Dora Tonks being a shape shifter was ever mentioned or the duel between SIrus and Bellatrix. The best parts of the film were Imelda's Staunton's performance as the wicked Dolores Jane Umbridge and getting the feeling of her office with the pink Lace and curtains and even the cats were well done. Another good thing about the film was Helena Bonaham Carter's performance as the insane Bellatrix Lestrange cousin of Sirus Black even though she was underused. Gary Oldman was given more on screen time after barely being scene in the Goblet of Fire and bonded really well with Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have really matured as actors and work well together. Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom was given an expanded role and has really shined well, turning from a comedic relief character to a brave wizard. The Order of the Phoenix could have been a much longer film with more character development. Definitely a much darker film."
307,8,Potter really does grow up!,"I had the usual expectations and excitement of a new Harry Potter movie, although I knew that a lot of the moments from the book are usually done away with. This film is spot on and much darker than all of the other films. There is less emphasis on out and out action and more story-telling moments, such as Luna and Harry's meeting with the Thestrals in which Luna explains why Harry and she can see them. Evanna is absolutely spot on in the film and embodies the idea of the character being slightly unusual but friendly and genuine nevertheless. For me, she was not in the film long enough and you wanted to get more about the character simply from meeting her."
308,9,Simply put- Excellent.,"Kudos to a director for finally giving HP the adult feel it needed. Nothing wrong with previous films being colourfull and having a target audience of pre to mid teens. This book, however, is much darker, and is reflected so in the motion picture. There are people trashing this film, I don't know what they expect. You cannot have everything. David Yates however, has brought the story back to me (long time since I read it) with just enough of what I needed to know. What makes me smile even more is that there were little and no comedic moments, no audience laughter, bar a few titters. There is no reason, and was no reason to have comic relief. Instead we are allowed to wallow in darker waters with no scripting to try to pull us out of it. The acting throughout is excellent. All of the characters were fully believable, my personal favourite being Bellatrix. Bohnam Carter manages to pull of deadly insanity without looking theatrical, and this is very important considering the tender nature of her past escapades. I would agree that there are some characters, Lupin for instance who is given next to no speaking parts and spends the limited time he has on camera merely looking at the conversation. What they *do* manage to do, is look like they are *part* of the story and the group, and not just extras or stand ins smiling for the camera. Yates has a background in TV vs films. This is obvious with his command of character direction. The film contains nice visuals, but he's not playing the film to visuals, he is using characters as the driving force. The films special effects, though integral, are secondary. As a book fan it delivers all I really need to know, as a film fan it more than delivers considering the bulk of the written word it has to convey in a film just over two hours."
309,7,"7 out of 10, but for Harry Potter fans only","I'm giving this a 7 out of 10, and that is generous - and I do this to say that Harry Potter fans will need to see this (I assume they will see all the films) but others (casual fans, people who are just looking for a random film to see) will not understand nor like this film."
310,5,"OK movie, but lacked ""the magic""","As Warner is under contract with J. K. Rowling, they are forced to some degree to stay with the story line, so those who have not read the books have no real frame of reference, though it is interesting to read their reviews. I believe this would be a very difficult movie to enjoy without reading the books, as there is no other way to fill in the gaps. There was no other way to understand most of the motivations, as they are not explained. As I am a big fan of the books, the conclusions that I drew from the movie were that Warner's primary decision on what part of the story stayed and what was cut was based on costs. Much of the ""magic"" was cut, and way too much time was spent just getting to Hogwarts."
311,1,Pathetic,"I saw the film on the day of release (12 July), and I was really excited about seeing it. I love the books and I love the films, but I hate the idea that the films came from the books, as they're nothing alike. The general ideas are the same, but the important parts are missing and Hermione gets all of Ron's lines! But let's get back to this film. It's the worst yet. As a film it's OK(ish), but as a film of a book it's terrible. HALF of the important things were missing and most of the characters are portrayed incorrectly. Also, what was going on with the filming? One part (I won't say which, or I might get accused of 'spoiling'), but one part, Harry's running and the camera man's running too, so the camera's shaking so much you can't actually see what's going on for a second! And the whole spinning paper thing? What was that about?! Rather pathetic, if you ask me. I really enjoyed the other films, even though they too leave out important parts that lead to the next films. I would also like to point out that Dumbledore suddenly has this Irish accent in film 3 (Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban), when he had no such thing in the first two! I'm glad they made the films as so many others who are too lazy to read the books have the story and excitement of Harry and his friends, but I wish they were better. There is so much room for improvement."
312,9,Way Better than the Book!!!,"I watched this IMAX version this morning and it was well worth the expense. This is one of those rare times where the movie is WAY BETTER than the book! The Order of the Phoenix is my least favorite of the six published books so far. The adventures were repetitive of previous books. I felt that nothing original was introduced. I also felt that it was not well-written since the action is not clearly described. When I finished the book, I did not feel any sense of awe that I felt especially with the fantastic 4th (Goblet of Fire) and 6th (Half Blood Prince) books! But this film was the total opposite. After sitting through disappointing film interpretations of the 3rd (Prisoner of Azkaban) and 4th books, this movie is a vast improvement over the book. I guess I have to credit the writer for distilling the ponderous text into this coherent and action-packed adventure script. And the director, David Yates, who is relative newcomer, who created an amazing vision from the lackluster printed words. The story is easy to follow, and logically sequenced. The action scenes are very well choreographed and executed on the big screen."
313,2,The most disappointing movie of the series so far...,"The good bits: Cinematography, lighting and set design is generally excellent, editing is snappy and effective, and Maggie Smith, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman continue to put in strong(ish) performances, given the weak and dumbed-down script they are forced to work with."
314,,I don't understand,"I don't understand why Harry Potter 4 has better rating then Harry Potter 5!?I hate the 4 movie,because the movie don't show the storyline of the book 4!Is very short and dark!I can barely see in moments!But 5 movie is excellent!I like it more than the others Harry Potter's movies!They drop quid ditch ,so what?You can see the love between Harry and Chan!The Patronus are cool and beautiful!Final battle is the best battle that I have seen in Harry Potter's movie!And there is small things of the book 5 that are put in the movie!And the idea to put a newspaper for cover is very good!Dimentors and centaurs are also cool and scary!Most of the people who like 4 movie it seems that they don't read the book!The book 4 is 100 times better than the movie!"
315,4,Now that's Disappointing !,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a disappointing movie....the story had some important bits cut out from it.Now who can forget skipping the Quidditch World Cup..... I had high expectations for the fifth installment of the Harry Potter movie series, but alas, it has left me much more disappointed than it's predecessor.... The movie is very boring and seems childish with it skipping very important plot points in comparison to the book which is simply awesome. The best acting performance comes from Ralph Fiennes who is simply outstanding as Lord Voldemort. The only best part of the movie is the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort...rest is simply unwatchable. Now if you are a true Harry Potter fan skip this movie and read the book instead..."
316,9,Saving the series,"After the fourth film, I had decided I would skip the remainder and move on with my life. I liked what the films had done, liked the cast, and the production was always first rate, but the feeling on my part was ""so what?"" I found myself wishing Rawlings had stopped at five books. I no longer felt involved."
317,7,Not a life-changing experience,"I have to admit, this movie wasn't the best I've seen. I can't believe I'm saying that about a Harry Potter film because I am a fan of the books and films. The main reason why this film isn't so good and the reason why the more recent films seem to be going downhill is simply because they are trying to take 600-800 pages of story and put them into a 2-3 hour movie. It just can't be done. They have to touch on all of the essential stuff for the series in that 2-3 hours and leave out certain other details. I really think that the ending sequence at the Ministry of Magic went way too fast, and Voldemort's entrance was far less dramatic than in the fourth film. However, this film does have quite a few bright spots. Many of the actors provide great performances. Daniel, Rupert and Emma all did very well, as usual as did Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson (Prof. Trelawney). Now, as for the new faces, Evanna Lynch played Luna Lovegood very well right down to her voice as J.K. Rowling had described in the book. It was as if she was Luna Lovegood. I almost stood up and cheered when Grawp picked up Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and when the centaurs carried her away. Imelda Staunton did a magnificent job bringing to life the very evil character that was Dolores Umbridge. I knew from when I first saw her in the scene from Harry's hearing about underage magic that I was going to really hate this character. A well done for Imelda Staunton. As for Helena Bonham Carter playing Bellatrix Lestrange, wonderfully evil. She portrayed Bellatrix with the utmost precision, and she seemed to take a few liberties as well, but they went very well with her character. Yes, there were quite a few good performances in this film and many of the special effects were very well done. I have never EVER seen an entire building expand. That was a really neat effect pretty much hearkening back to the effect of the appearance of the doorway into Diagon Alley in the first film. The battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort was another triumph of special effects and acting. While this film wasn't quite as good story wise, it certainly did well enough for a 7 out of 10 stars from me."
318,5,Unlimited potential is met with limited results,"First off this movie has met every requirement for a summer blockbuster. The movie has bad acting, which can only be blamed on the director because they cast is a very talented one containing several Oscar winners, cheesy dialogue, a poorly written story that leaves even non Harry Potter readers asking why and what happened. The last thing is the special effect which could have been some of the best ever. But they weren't . With companies like ILM revolutionizing the special effects industry, as seen with Transformers, we must ask ourselves what did they do to Harry Potter."
319,2,I had to have yawned at least seven times...,"Even before the halfway point of the movie, most of the audience had lost total interest, and began holding conversations amongst themselves. I kept asking myself, where's the action? The characters just kept talking and talking and talking. Pure exposition never makes for a good movie."
320,3,I half expected his head to spin around,"If you're not going to keep to the plot and spirit of the book, why direct it? JK Rowling has no say over what they do to her books, but in the first 4, the directors and screen writers kept to the feeling and plot of the books. These books are loved and pored over by millions of people. The first movies basically stayed with the plot and ambiance of the book. This one was tricked up to give it a more ""horror movie"" feeling, to the detriment of the movie. Yes, it needed to be darker; the book was definitely darker on many levels, but the way it was done changed this pivotal book in the series to not much more than a mish-mash of scenes that lent themselves to the machinations of typical Hollywood horror movies. It begins immediately, in Little Whinging. Why change the way Harry and Dudley first encounter each other? Why change the way dementors look? Why minimize the shock Harry feels when he learns Mrs. Figg is a squib? Why totally eliminate the important scene when Harry realizes that Aunt Petunia knows about dementors and understands about the evil of Voldemort? (And why have Aunt Petunia dressed in what looks like a trashy sun-suit type outfit that might have been seen in the 40's? It looked ridiculous.) The point of it in the book was to blur the line between the wizarding world and the Muggle world; it was glossed over for no reason. Obviously this idiot of a director and the screen writer don't truly know the books. I could go on with just the problems with the first 20 minutes, and the movie goes down hill from there. Plot lines were chronologically changed. The person who betrays Dumbledore's Army is changed to Cho-- why? That is a totally ridiculous and unnecessary plot change. Percy Weasley shows up working with Fudge, no explanation of why or the background of the rift in his family, which is key in the next book. Why have Umbridge in muggle clothes throughout the movie? The book sets her apart by having her wear a horrible pink cardigan over her robes, which is much more ridiculous look than having her wear- admittedly horrible- muggle clothes. The wonderful feeling of revenge the students have while harassing Umbridge when she takes over as Headmistress is all condensed into one scene of Fred and George throwing fireworks and flying out of the castle-- no explanation of the background of that, of the coming of their joke shop, of the fact that Fred, George and Harry's broomsticks had been confiscated by the foul Umbridge. When the six rescuers take off on the thestrals to go to the Ministry, the fact that three of them cannot see the thestrals and feel as though they're going to fall while flying on invisible creatures is ignored. The intriguing rooms in the Department of Mystery are eliminated, and the room with the prophesies and the duel with the Death Eaters before the Order arrives is condensed and does not show how well the students were able to fight off the Death Eaters, or the fact that Hermione and Ron are possibly seriously hurt. Even though Bellatrix Lestrange calls Harry a filthy mudblood, they left out the crucial fact that Harry informs the Death Eaters that Voldemort himself is a mudblood, that his father was a muggle-- more clear evidence that the director does not really know these books or the point of all of it. Bellatrix Lestrange, who in the book oozes evil and is obviously devoted to Voldemort, is shown more as a madwoman, and disapparates without talking to Voldemort. The worst scene of all is when Voldemort possesses Harry-- he suddenly turns into a modern version of Linda Blair's possessed character in The Excorcist, red eyes and all. I half expected his head to spin around. The crucial scene, where Harry talks with Dumbledore about what it all means, the point of the whole reason for Harry's fate being connected to Voldemort's, is glossed over into about 4 lines of dialogue between them. The only reason I gave this film even 3 stars is because there were a few good scenes, where they actually kept to the spirit and the plot of the book-- Harry and Cho's kiss; Harry's anger both because of adolescence and because his emotions are tied with Voldemort's; and Luna Lovegood; -- were all very well done. Also, cinematography was good. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have become fine actors. It's been fun seeing them not only grow up, but grow in their profession. In the past, we've gone to see each of the HP movies at least three times while they were in theaters, to experience them on the big screen, and bought the DVD when it was released. We won't be doing that this time. Of course, the director and the movie studio can count on huge audiences for these movies, because of the books, and it's obvious in this one that because of a guaranteed huge profit, they saw no reason to give this book the spirit of Rowling's book that it deserved. I'm sure many people will bring up the point that these books are so long that of course they have to be cut, shortened, manipulated to fit time constraints, and of course that's true-- but the first four managed to do that and still stick to plot lines and the point of each book. This one is such a disappointment. If the next movie is directed and written by the same people as this one, I won't be seeing it. Not that the cost of my one ticket will make the slightest dent in Warner Brother's pockets, but at least I'll have the satisfaction of not contributing to their profit."
321,8,Disapoited,"While in my opinion ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the second best book and second best movie in the series. What was disappointing was the identity of the traitor of the location where ""Dumbledore's Army"" was meeting was incorrect and it didn't show the spell used to punish the traitor. Also the scene where Fred and George Weasley reeks havoc during the O.W.L. exams was watered down. Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter was scary and desirable at the same time."
322,8,Lost its magic?.... nah i don't think so!,"An entertaining movie from the start, the acting from Daniel Radcliffe this time was much better than the other movies, You can see & feel that Harry has matured more & not only is he dealing with people not believing Vol... (He who must not be named) is back but also trying for the affections of a certain Ravenclaw."
323,5,Professor Umbridge and the Order of the Female Dog,SCORE: 5.2/10
324,6,"Good story, bad pacing","My favorite two are Prisoneer of Azkaban and Philosopher stone. I did enjoy the story of this film, but found it lacked the action, and became very bogged down in pacing, in some scenes to the point I was watching the click on dvd player. Umbridge was a great addition as this films secondary villian as you truly despise her character for the affixiating effect she has over the school. Though dark and slightly boring one of the best scenes, is when the centaurs in the forest have Umbridge, and she tells Harry to tell them she means no harm, to which he replies""I cannot tell a lie"" which was a nod to an earlier scene. It's ok but not the most memorable of the series. 2.5/5."
325,2,The Rocky Five and death knell of the Harry Potter Franchise,"I haven't read the books and maybe Order of the Phoenix (OOTP) is an accurate telling of the book. But for me, I have lost all affection for the Harry Potter franchise. OOTP is too dark, too complicated and has lost the magic that endeared me to the blockbusting phenomena that the first two Harry Potter's instilled."
326,10,The blockbuster of this summer,I had the luck to view the preview show yesterday for this great movie. A great treat for harry potter fans. The director has brilliantly tried to stitch in all pieces of the plot of the huge fifth book of harry potter and is wonderfully successful to get it done in this 2 hour movie.
327,4,Fits within this series of incredibly mediocre films,This has to be one of the most variable series in quality I've seen
328,9,Impressive since the book was kind of boring,"Don't get me wrong I love the series but the 5th book was almost a bore to read till the end. But it was because it's one of those filler books that does most of the explaining. The film though, wow. Amazing cinematography. Like from start to finish it was so beautiful to watch, even the simplest of scenes were shot brilliantly. Yes there are a few changes in the story but nothing that changes the effect. However, for those that read the book and cried at the end (knowing what I mean) you'll cry in this just as well. Radcliffe REALLY nailed the part in this one because this is THE book where Harry is more depressed than ever seen before. It was dark and eerie and he has never been so interesting to watch. His expressions and body language were perfect. I was very impressed with the movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone who may not even be a fan. The only criticism I have is that for some of the more important content of the book... well it wasn't as welll explained, for instance the prophecy was NOT well explained in the movie and in order to understand the story I thought that was kind of a let down. Great though!"
329,9,Formidable Adaptation: book reader's review,"Unlike some of the previous Harry Potter (HP) films, mostly uncompromising adaptations which visualised but failed to deliver the charm of the books to the big screen, 'Order of the Phoenix' (OotP) is a film at heart, borrowing from the book but also improvising to recreate the full range of emotions experienced while reading the book. Where the previous films butchered the plot and subplots, often mishandled the crucial moments and overly stepped into banal territory, OotP is oddly satisfying to watch."
330,5,"A decent movie, but not great","I was expecting a lot going into this movie. I've read every book but the fifth one, so I didn't really know what to expect as per plot. While the movie WAS very well choreographed and filmed, the acting just wasn't there. I feel like few too many people are looking at this movie for what it really is: a filler. Every 13 year old girl on the internet says it is the best movie yet, but I beg to differ. The emotional depth was lacking, and the set was poorly designed. I didn't feel like I was at Hogwarts, rather just a movie stage with Daniel Radcliffe doing a decent harry potter impersonation. Harry seemed angry the entire movie, but you never really get to understand why until the end. If you haven't read the book, you spend the entire movie wondering why he's so mad the entire time. Secondly, the plot progressed way too fast. Within the first fifteen minutes, Harry was already in the grand hall eating. Where's the setup? All in all, the movie acted out and felt like exactly what the book was supposed to be: a filler and guide for the sixth and seventh installments. If this movie is indicative of what the last two movies are going to be like, I think we are all going to be sorely disappointed."
331,3,Disappointing to readers of the novels,"The first three movies involving Chris Columbus were great and lived up to my expectations. I'd wish Warner would bring back the old team from Philospher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, and put a little more effort in developing a script which comes at least close to the the books of JKR. Also, why is John Williams not doing the music anymore? Order of Phoenix and especially it's predecessor Goblet of Fire are poorly scored, compared to Williams graceful style of orchestration and extraordinary thematic development. OoTF leaves out essential parts of the story, just to prevent to produce an over length movie. Epic and complicated stories need time to unfold, so better let Peter Jackson or Chris Columbus direct part 6 and 7 and bring back John Willams for the music score."
332,10,By far the best,"Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix was by far the best of the Harry Potter movies made. The characters are very well developed, you almost feel as though over the years you have watched the young stars grow up. The special effects is great, and all new characters are portrayed greatly. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Dolores Umbridge. Throughout the whole movie I was looking forward to the part when she gets kicked out of Hogwarts, which means she played the character very well. The only bad thing that I can say about the movie is this: the major characters that had a very big part in previous films were not as big in this one. For example Professor McGonagal only appeared like three scenes. Other then that this movie is good and Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed."
333,7,Overall a wonderful adaptation,"Let's face it. The entire book was never going to fit into a two-a-a-half hour long movie. People are complaining that there are so many aspects of the novel missing, and although I do have a few complaints, I think it was well written enough, and it was definitely very entertaining. "
334,8,"The worst book, but the best film","I have read and enjoyed each of the Harry Potter books, although I have only read them once each. Reading other's comments, it appears that I am in the minority in that I found that the Order of the Phoenix contained the most redundancy. For me, the first 200 pages and the last 200 pages were up to the usual standard, but the middle section (and a hefty section at that, being over 400 pages) felt an awful lot like filler."
335,10,excellent,"oh my god! it was spectacular! i just love it! fantastic. best movie ever! i can't believe it! my favorite movie of the history. Ron harry Hermione Ginny Fred George Malfoy every one so great! never in my life i Be been waiting a movie so long like this! great could be a movie so nice and perfect? action drama horror gotta everything for be such a good movie! congratulations David Yates you did it best movie ever! i wait exited to see harry potter and the half blood prince will be better i hope! harry i love you, Ron i love you you are so beautiful harry what are you doing? stay here you are wonderful, a little bit stupid but fantastic with your wand and your invisibility cloth! go on harry! never give up"
336,9,Best One Yet: From the Acting to the CGI,"I am an avid fan of both the Harry Potter books and movies, and therefore I have quite a bit of experience in the world of Harry Potter when I say this: This is the best Harry Potter movie to date. On thing that David Yates seems to get that none of the other directors did is that the movie is ABOUT THE KIDS, how they interact, discover the miscarraiges of justice in the world, and make decisions based on who they are becoming as people. All in all, the best part of this great film was the acting from the kids' end. Student who have had fairly prevalent roles in the books finally got to exercise some sort of emotion, a notion that has been lost in the other movies due to a need to cram as much plot line in as possible. Finally, David Yates figured out the secret: Make a MOVIE out of Harry Potter, trim down the plot, create good and bad, and allow that actors to act and make a movie out of it, with special effects laying the foundation for the magic that they create. The film captured all of this deftly."
337,2,Sickeningly horrible adaptation of a truly remarkable book,"How do you ""stupify"" an audience of avid canon Harry Potter fans? Force them into a theater, and make them sit through the film adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""."
338,3,Too Fast And Devoid Of A Reason To Exist,"The fifth Harry Potter film doesn't feel much like a film at all, everything happens too fast, as it whizzes through an entire year of events, lines babbled under too-loud music, making it feel as if nothing is really happening and with no noticeable time actually passing until Dumbledore informs Harry that he has been ignoring him for a year. A year? Surely not. Nothing happened."
339,10,The best of the films,"Up until tonight y pick for best Potter film was Prisoner of Azkaban, hands down. It had the perfect blend of magic and realism that the others lacked, the direction was fantastic and the cast showing that under the direction of an amazing director like Alfonso Cuaron they could truly shine. I loved Prisoner of Azkaban, I love it more every time I see it. So when I say that Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film thus far, its a big deal to me. The movie is wonderful, the acting is top notch, Radcliff really shines here as Harry but everyone is excellent. The script is the best adaptation yet. Every decision to truncate or cut in order to fit an enormous book into a reasonable running time is perfect. Sure, I miss things, we all will, but unlike Goblet of Fire which made in my opinion every wrong choice on cutting story, this film did it all right. I honestly did not mind a single change, even the things I would have liked to have seen here were not necessary. I'm trying to keep this a spoiler free as possible so I won't say what parts I mean. I will say one spoilerish thing though..The wizard battle at the end was fantastic, wow. David Yates' direction was perfect, he knew just when to make things intense and when to make them emotional. He showed a real command of the material and how to realize it on screen. Hats off to him, I am very pleased that he will be directing Half Blood Prince. Now I just need to keep my fingers crossed that Alfonso will be back to do Deathly Hallows..."
340,3,Abortion of the Phoenix,"Let me start by saying, there have been few books in my life that worked so on my emotions as Order of the Phoenix, at least there the movie didn't disappoint. "
341,7,Movie vs. Book,"The movie obviously could not live up to the book so those who are die hard book fans, don't expect too much. The movie seemed very short and many great parts from the books were either left out or shortened greatly. To catch every detail from an 870 page book, the movie would have to be 12 hours long so I understand some things need to be cut out. However, there is no need for the fillers such as the bird paper airplane in the first defense against the dark arts class and the detention where every one is writing with the hand cutting pens. Instead could we see some Quidditch? Maybe St. Mungo's? Fred's and George's swamp? Or how about the Quibbler interview? And last but not least, the Prophecy explanation by Dumbledore at the end of the book? Why not add some more time onto the movie to put these things in. I just don't get why the longest book is the shortest movie. Although these things were cut out, I don't want to be a downer completely. The movie was still very fun and entertaining and the special effects were great."
342,3,Sadly Disappointed,So I just got home from seeing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I'm still not sure what i think of it yet.... As a movie alone it was very good. As an adaptation from the book not so good.... IMO this movie is better seen when you haven't read the book or not a really big fan of the book...
343,10,Exactly how I hoped it would be!,"Now, the fifth book was, by far, my favorite of the series, so expectations were somewhat high for the movie. I'm actually glad to say that I left with a smile on my face."
344,10,Simply Amazing! David Yates has the touch! Warning Possibly Spoilers!,"OK, I went to the midnight showing last night and let me tell you, this movie was freakin awesome! I was expecting more not so following the book story line, but thats far from what I got. They followed the book almost... ALMOST perfectly. There were even plenty of lines straight out of the book. (I know i've read it like 20 times). Imelda Staunton should get an award for her role as Umbridge. If you thought Umbrdige ticked you off and or scared you in the book. She'd make you want to choose Norman Bates in his mothers dress to watch your children than you would her. The battle scenes are awesome. You really get into them and it's just amazing. I'm trying my best not to really to ruin it for anyone. Overall, this movie is by far the best out of all 5 thats been made so far. David Yate's directing was amazing and our favorite Potter Actors have come so far, they've really grown into their roles."
345,7,Potter actually,"This part 5 of a septology (if that is indeed a word and means series of seven or something like that). You couldn't tell by it's title (at least I couldn't), if you're not an avid reader of the books. Which I'm certainly not (guilty as charged, for not having read any of the Potter books)."
346,6,OKAy compared to the book,"Well i guess i'll start with the pro's for the movie. Last night i went to the midnight opening of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and it was quite a thrill. The graphics i have to say were superb especially when Voldemort and Dumbledore fight in the ministry of magic and all the newspaper pictures, moving and what not."
347,10,And the movies are turning even darker,"With each movie, Harry Potter is more grown-up - and so are the movies. I am damn sure, that I personally wouldn't show this movie to a 6 years old kid. It is aimed at people around 15-17. But it also appeals to older people - like me. Especially if you like fantasy - like me. "
348,3,I can't believe someone liked this crap,"I've read all the books and seen all the movies. The movies are in general very lame, but this one is no less than a huge dump on Rowling's face."
349,5,The slow build begins,This was my least favourite book of the series as it only really acts as a long winded build up to what happens later but happily what new director David Yates has done is to turn that original source material into a worthy addition to the film saga.
350,9,Excellent,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter books I always look forward to the movies. I've never been let down with any movie as I was still really young (eleven) when the first one came out so I didn't know any better. However looking back on all of them now I definitely recognize their faults and strengths. I was very excited to see The Order of the Phoenix but a little skeptical since this had been my least favorite book. I was blown away. If I could have kept any director it definitely would have been Alfonso Cuaron, whose style and touches were perfectly suited for the third movie and a welcome change from Chris Columbus's kid-glove style. Mike Newell did a decent job with the fourth movie, though it suffered from plot changes that didn't work well. I did (and still do think) that he had the toughest challenge thus far with staging Voldemort's return and he did do a good job with that. David Yates did an amazing job. I really loved that he kept the movie dark and unsettling, with a few smatters of well-done dry humor here and there. The book is dense and not a pleasant trip and he conveyed that sense beautifully. He also managed to achieve something that none of the other directors, not even Cuaron, could do: he made the movie flow. None of the first four movies flow well at all; they all feel awkward and jerky and you can almost always see when they remove something from the book and try and smooth the transition. By showing the issues of the Daily Prophet as transitions he keeps you informed on what is going on outside the walls of Hogwarts as well as inside. It was a brilliant touch that I loved."
351,8,Playtime is forever finished at Hogwarts!,"If you consider the Harry Potter franchise a coming-of-age film series, which I'm sure J. K. Rowling imagined it to be next to being a fantasy and adventure series, then ""Order of the Phoenix"" represents the dawn of a new era for young wizard Harry and his friends. Out with the innocence and playfulness, in with responsibilities and the everlasting battle for the right of your existence in this cruel and harsh world. The childhood era of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", during which fooling around and making mistakes was allowed - and even encouraged - is long gone. The puberty phase of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Goblet of Fire"", when it was still okay to discover oneself and revolt against the rules without too many consequences, is forever over and done with as well. Harry and C° enter adolescence in ""The Order of the Phoenix"", and with it comes the confrontation with injustice, the frustration of bureaucracy, and the foundation of life-long relationships; - whether friendships or vendettas."
352,6,frustration beyond belief,Compared to the book the movie is way to short and inferior .
353,1,Harry potter was just terrible,"Harry Potter And the Order of the Phoenix was just terrible, everything almost EVERYTHING about it was bad. Apart from the last fight scene, the movie couldn't have been much worse. If Hollywood was planning on filming all the books they should have at LEAST kept the same director as the first two. But to me that really doesn't matter at all compared to the real problems it had. In the first to movies, Harry had a good length of hair, in a bowl cut. acceptable. Now his hair is always changing as well as Ron's and Hermione's. Can't it just be like LOTR where their hair is all the same through out the whole trilogy. I mean you can debate the fact that harry is growing up and his hair style is changing but it never changed in the first two movies though."
354,6,Not the happiest of films...,"The series really starts getting dark now... Harry is ""touchy"", loosing his temper and not knowing why (hey, he's a teen!). Dolores Umbridge is highly disturbing, which means Imelda Staunton did a good job with the character. But the feeling of the film is depressing..."
355,10,Pow,Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better
356,7,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Harry Potter's internal struggle with the evil Lord Voldemort is at the heart of this cerebral installment, taking a break from the overpowering action we are used to seeing(..tournament wizard contests and such)instead focusing on a potential threat towards Hogwarts school in the chuckling new professor, Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton)with her wide-eyes and seemingly modest exterior harbours an aggressive desire to have full control of the school, operating by her strict standards, attempting to remove wizardry, enabling the students to practice their craft. Secretly a war is brewing between Dumbledore(Michael Gambon)and Voldemort with Harry playing a vital chess piece. It will be revealed that either Harry or Voldemort will live but both can not co-exist, a prophesy most certain to propel the next film. But, this film does follow Harry' further growth as a powerful wizard, and his nemesis particularly in this movie is Umbridge who wishes to silence the young man from even mentioning Voldemort's name. Pursuing the knowledge of casting spells which can protect them from harm, and thus enabling them to join Dumbledore's army, Hermoine(Emma Watson)and Ron(Rupert Grint)will convince Harry to train volunteers secretly behind Umbridge's back. Harry also converses with his godfather, wrongfully accused serial killer Sirius Black(Gary Oldman)who keeps him informed of the latest news regarding what Dumbledore wishes to remain hidden for his safety. We witness a very paranoid Minster of the Ministry of Magic believing that Dumbledore may be enlisting a force against him(..perhaps in part to whispers from those who might wish to see Dumbledore out as headmaster of Hogwarts)and it's visible as the newspapers increase the unease as Potter's claim of Voldemort's return has many split, some considering it bogus, others worried that he's correct."
357,1,Horrendous,"This movie felt like a series of trailers strung together to make a terrible movie. No scenes were elaborate, huge discrepancies with the books, and a low budget look came with it. This was the largest disappointment I have experienced at the movies, worse than the second Pirates of the Caribbean film. I would not recommend anybody see this movie, but the opposite. If you are excited for the final book, don't see this movie because it will kill your excitement for Harry Potter. Every character had a shredded role, leaving no emotional connection and everything from the previous films were altered to make a movie with no grasp on what Harry Potter is."
358,10,Harry Potter is the best thing ever....thank you J.K.Rowling,I am such an idiot. I totally engulfed myself in reviewing bollywood movies i totally forgot about my other true love which is harry potter. I love harry potter i mean not the actual character or Daniel Radcliffe because he's ugly i mean i just love the ideas and stuff associated with harry potter. The final book is so good. It's absolutely brilliant and amazing and the fifth film s definitely the best film so far lol i sound like homer from the Simpson's movie but is anyone has read the 7th book they will know how amazing it is. It is actually indescribable ... just pure genius. Anyway the film is very good the director has really taken into account about the gist of the film and made one amazing movie because the plot in th book is so clever the film just has to be good. Umbridge played her part well and it gives you a sense of what the characters are when you read the books you can relate the characters to the one's that played them in the film. In short Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is brilliant definitely deserves the ten out of ten
359,7,A respite from the dark,"Are there any of you out there who really love the Harry Potter movies but wish they were shorter and funnier? Your favorite of the eight-part series will probably be the fifth: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Clocking in at twenty minutes less than the previous movie, several montages, set to new composer Nicholas Hooper's lively and comedic music, help move the plot along. This is the only installment Steve Kloves didn't write, and the new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg tries to turn the film into as much of a comedy as he can, probably to console the audience after the dark ending of the previous film. As the students grow older and battle their raging hormones, the audience gets to laugh at them and relax."
360,8,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" Brings the Darkness","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth movie in the Harry Potter franchise and brings a much darker tone to the series on Letterboxd. The story follows Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) as he struggles with the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and the return of Lord Voldemort (played by Ralph Fiennes)."
361,8,Darkening but enjoyable,"Things were dark in the HP universe for Harry right from the start: now they are starting to get darker for everyone else, too. Unfortunately the Minstry of Magic has ostrich syndrome and chooses to manifest this by installing the petty-minded bullying bureaucrat Dolores Umbrage in charge at Hogwarts."
362,8,The Phoenix Flies!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Imelda Staunton, Michael Gambon: Enchanting film regarding banding together as Potter is expelled from Hogwarts School where everyone is denied the truth about his battle against evil Lord Voldemont. After the issue goes to counsel there are protest against anyone claiming the existence of Voldemont. To make things worse the strict Dolores Umbridge arrives with her own ideas for discipline. Absolutely astonishing with detail and a blazing climax. Director David Yates is backed by a breathtaking visuals that are completely on par with previous films in their creativity and fetching nature. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry goes through a centre of attention he will be reluctant to repeat. He fights the battle of good and evil within him and learns that it cannot be fought alone. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also return as Harry's best friends Ron and Harmoine whom accompany him in his quest to overthrow Umbridge. Imelda Staunton as the strict Dolores Umbridge steals her scenes but ultimately will become the one being taught the lesson by the students. Michael Gambon once again plays headmaster Dumbledore whose authority will surpass Umbridge. Not for young children but those seeking thrilling adventure are ordered to view the Phoenix. Score: 8 / 10"
363,9,"This is a great transition film that builds perfectly off the last picture and projects into a vast, dark and exciting future",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Harry heading back to school where no one believes him that Lord Voldemort is back and thinks he made it all up. Even the new teacher is telling all the students Harry is a liar. Harry will need to avoid the wrath of the new teacher and ensure all his friends and believers are prepared for Lord Voldemort's presence.
364,8,Easily one of the best entries in the series.,"'Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix (2007)' is more concise than past entries, with much of its plot conveyed in montage. It's incredibly focused, its two or three strand narrative being placed above all other aspects. In some ways, it feels a little rushed. Yet, the focus on the school itself and the teenage ensemble is refreshing. It's nice to be introduced to some proper magical combat, too. The piece manages to maintain a decent tonal balance throughout, elaborating upon the bleaker aspects of the lore but still making time for levity. It's easily one of the best in its series thanks to a fine exploration of several core characters and some proper stakes, even those that go unseen for most of the piece. Plus, its finale is fantastic. 8/10"
365,7,Not A Bad Film,It isn't all that bad - not my favorite Potter flick but it is still a film worth watching.
366,5,Hurry up Harry! (with thanks to Sham 69!),"I quite like the Harry Potter books and try to read the novel of the film before-hand and so approached ""Order Of The Phoenix"", wondering like many, just how the director could cut a 700 page novel into a just over two hours movie. The conclusion I draw is, very unconvincingly, so much so that it's no surprise to me to learn that the production team behind this money-spinning franchise plan to split the last humungously large novel into two parts. That's not to say that JK Rowling's writing couldn't do with some pruning for the big screen, but certainly on the evidence of this poorly edited instalment, I'm more in favour of the double-up plan. There's's also the dread element of inherent formula-ism, dictated of course by the source novels, following as usual the path of Harry encountering his magical friends and / or enemies in the neighbourhood of Little Whinging, displacement to Hogworts, his in-out tribulations with friends Hermione and Ron, interaction with teachers good and bad, winding up with a big, dramatic climax where nothing is resolved one way or the other - Voldemort always lives to fight another day. It must have been almost impossible for the director to do any more with these base elements than is conjured up here, but even with the introduction of the mildest of love interest (from out of nowhere, or so the film would have it) between Harry and Cho, a reasonably malevolent turn by Imelda Staunton as on-the-make Black Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge and the death at the finale of Harry's beloved godparent, Sirius, the film fails to engage leaving the viewer breathless at the end, certainly admiring of the SFX on show but ultimately dissatisfied that Harry and his cohorts get to the end of the film in no more danger than the last. Victims of the breakneck editing of the piece, to the best of my recollection, are, besides the wholesale extraction of the Quidditch tournament which sees Ron humiliated then redeemed as goal-minder, a series of key scenes that are almost butchered in the rush to get to the end. These include, as hinted earlier, the lack of any meaningful build-up to Harry's kiss with Cho, the revealing of her later complicity in ratting to Umbridge of Harry's behind-her-back dark arts lessons to his school chums, Voldemort's attack on the Weasleys' father, the session with Snape which reveals Harry's parents in their bullying of the young Snape not to be the golden-couple everyone imagined them to be. Most gaping of all is the sly Staunton's fate - the last you see of her she's being whisked away by a bunch of angry centaurs, then at the resolution, you're blandly told in a newspaper montage that she's lost her position as Headteacher. Guess she got away from the centaurs unscathed then..! All this and more flies by in a blur, with very little humour to lighten the load, almost zero characterisation and at the end one feels the way you would as if you've gone through a flight-simulator type ride at a theme park rather than the real deal of an actual roller-coaster. Goodness knows how people who haven't read the novel made sense of it! Maybe the little kids will understand, as Jim Morrison once said, but the more discerning of them and the rest of us, might feel shortchanged by Harry's Gang, this time around."
367,1,Who are you and what have you done to the plot?,"I have just come home from the premiere of the movie in Croatia, and i must say that this is a huge disappointment. No, huge is not the word - enormous."
368,8,The Phoenix has Risen Indeed,"I would begin my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with the statement I've made before: A return to greatness, but sadly, the series, to date, has never been even close to this level of quality."
369,8,Wonderful...,"Watching the last one missing to close the cute franchise, the most beautiful little witches I've ever seen, too delicate, a shame the most stylish prof of the work is evil, Dolores Umbridge ... Helena Bonham Carter great as the crazy sister, these cartoon characters they always suit you ..."
370,2,Flat-out disappointment,"How can a movie be filled with actors who are flat, boring and don't come near the emotional potential of Rowling's original characters, yet be so hyper-active and jumpy that you feel like you're going to have a seizure? If this sounds like a fun movie experience, this is the movie for you! "
371,,The franchise is becoming dark for the better,"A lot is changing as this franchise is progressing and for the most part for the better. Yeah the movies seem to be getting shorter and is starting to miss a lot more from the books. But there is better satire in this and it's not dull to sit through. I don't know if it's because of the passing of time, but the cinematography is getting a lot better and so is the acting. Not amazing acting but much better this time around. But most of all the franchise seems to becoming darker. What I also liked was how there is more wizards and witch battles this time around which lacked in the previous novels. And it's good to see that Harry is growing up and using magic to fight while teaching others to do the same and even getting a girl. The choices come in to play big time with characters that are good and characters that are presented bad or some even in the middle is starting to make important choices that can change there original characteristics and direction. Again the book is long and it's kinda disappointing how short the movie is, in fact it has the shortest running time in the franchise. Even thought he book is really long, it just seemed to be missing a lot from it. I know it's not possible to fit everything from the book into one movie, but could have fit a lot more. Anyways it seems the franchise overall is turning dark for the better."
372,9,An overall improvement!,"Although the the general approach of this movie is quite similar to the others, like getting the story out in a short a time as possible, the outcome is quite different. The problem with the others is that it was very obvious where things had been removed, at least for fans of the books. But while watching this installment of the series, the plot sucks you in so much that you're hardly thinking about that. The direction was far better than the previous ones, a credit to Yates, who fully deserves to take a crack at the next movie. However, the greatest improvement is that of the acting! Finally all the main actors have fully embraced their roles, making you believe that they are none other than the actual characters themselves. In addition, the special effects were superb and the choreography of the fight scenes well mastered. While you may walk out of the theater, thinking about what things may have been left out, you'll have no such thoughts during the movie itself!"
373,7,It was a terrific experience.,"Sometimes I got angry with myself for not reading the books when I was a kid. Even though it was too late, I read the books. I loved this movie (since I didn't read the book when I was a kid) and it was also a little scary for me. It was a terrific experience."
374,7,"Great movie overall; 2/3 book, 1/3 What the heck happened???","Let me first say I finished reading book five for the second time just a few weeks ago so it's very fresh in my mind, and perhaps that affected me."
375,8,Brian,Harry is haunted by nightmares and the ministry of magic attempts to take more control over Hogwartz.
376,8,Harry Takes on the Leadership Role,"I'm sure it's difficult for any filmmaker to adapt a beloved novel, but David Yates had an extraordinary task attempting to cut down the longest Potter novel into what happens to be, the second shortest film in the series. I didn't read the books, so I can't specifically comment on the quality of the adaptation, but I do know that Order of the Phoenix is one damn good film."
377,1,Utter dreck!,Nothing happens. Nothing. Period.<br /><br />You can completely omit this movie and nothing would change.<br /><br />Boring cliche and utterly mindless.
378,7,one of the better Potter films but....,"still too much left out from the book. I thought this fifth installment of Harry Potter was better than the first few. But, after having read the book, I know that there is a lot left out. All these books should have been given 4 plus hours like the seventh book will be. Then maybe all the great smaller story lines would not end up on the cutting room floor. The movie left out a lot of what Kreacher did and there is no quiddich for Harry to get banned from. A lot of the back ground of Bellatrix Lestrange is left out of the movie. That was a very interesting part of the book. Where the book focuses on why Harry got attacked by the Deatheaters in the beginning and the increasing power of the Dark Lord, the movie seems to center around Dorlos Umbridge and her taking over Hogwarts."
379,,"A spectacular fantasy film, with brilliant performances and lean direction!","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter film to date, either tied with or surpassing Prisoner of Azkaban. The new director, David Yates, is very lean and confident, and his direction helps make this new Harry Potter film more mature. It feels more like a regular film, while in ways that is a downside, but also an upside seeing as how sometimes the Harry Potter films might be seen as children's' films. It's cinematography and photography is handsome, but not in the visual way that Prisoner's was. It is more bleak, more moody as well. It has a certain gloomy feeling, while it might turn off a lot of viewers seeing as how how it is different (especially after Goblet of Fire's more cheery and happy tone), I find that an improvement because it demonstrates a feeling of growth and maturity, in both the characters and the film itself. The new screenwriter was impressive. He was able to cut a lot of things out, and still leave a lot in while still not making it sort of all over the place, a flaw that presided in Goblet of Fire. Daniel Radcliffe's performance here is actually quite good. It took him five films, but he is finally able to demonstrate all of Harry's emotions and feelings very well. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play their characters well. But the performance to talk about here( or rather, performances) is that of Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter. Imelda Staunton delivers a perfect performance, identical to that of the book's character. She is menacing, villainous, arrogant, obsessive, controlling, and she plays that all with a bit of humanity. What a performance! The Oscars should have caught on. Helena Bonham Carter delivers that same presence, and she plays Bellatrix with such force. Every second she is on screen(which is not a lot, maybe a minute overall) you cannot help but look at her. I just wish her role was bigger, and I hope her role in Half-Blood Prince is larger. She definitely deserved a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination if she can conduct that much passion for a character. The effects and the production designs are all fantastic as always, and the score, ranging from happy tunes to gloomy melodies, is perfect! Both Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix are the two films of the franchise that manage to be amazing films. Two of the best in fantasy for sure, and I hope Half-Blood prince does not disappoint."
380,10,It was Awesome baby with a capital A!!!!!,"**May have spoilers** Let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of the books. In my opinion this was by far the best Harry Potter movie made to date. OK, so they did cut a lot of stuff out, but the book was almost 900 pages long. Before the movie i went in thinking, ""damn the prophecy is trimmed down, quiditch is gone, no hospital scene, etc"" but from the moment the movie started i was completely blown away. I LOVVVVVEDDDDDD this movie. The times when they were in the room of requirement was awesome. Watching everyone learning how to do a patronus made me smile the entire time. And don't even get me started on the ministry of magic. The battle in the end blew my mind. I can go on and on but i don't want to bore anyone. Go see this movie"
381,6,An interesting movie so as to speak...,"I saw this movie on 12th. I would say this is the third best Harry Potter movie. The special effects are really awesome. So is the music. This movie much darker like the third one. If compared with the book, honestly, this movie is total crap."
382,8,A passage to maturity.,"This film is the adaptation of the fifth book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by JK Rowling, and is the first film that was directed by David Yates, the last director to join the franchise, this time to stay. Yates was up to the task: this film is one of the most complex and profound of the saga and have some important psychological developments of the characters, as well as large computerized effects and great moments of action. "
383,8,"Entertaining, albeit Slow Moving,","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. For a fifth installment, the series is still fresh and exciting as ever, I don't feel one bit bored of these characters or watching their latest adventure. It's different from the other four in that it is a lot more dialogue based, much less action, although this isn't a huge problem as the cast is so fantastic that's it's nice to see them shine as actors in scenes that literally just involve them talking. The film is certainly anti- climactic, there's a constant build up throughout, as the characters discuss Voldemort's return, we are anxiously anticipating his arrival for the entire movie, and then once he comes, he's gone before we know it, they could have dragged out the scene much more and trimmed others to make it a more pleasing finale. Returning cast members are still as great as ever, Ralph Fiennes further develops his role as the series main villain and is as terrifying as ever, the movie also features great new characters portrayed by talented actors such as Imelda Staunton, Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter, all playing very strong female characters that steal every scene they're in. Though it may be lacking the intensity of previous installments, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is still a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. "
384,7,"Some New, Some Old","11 July 2007. Part of this new episode seems forced and manipulative. There are editing scenes that seem to be added just to add something new that really don't help the plot along. There seems to be gaps in the story and a few places that have been cut short, especially between Professor Snape and Harry Potter. Overall, there is some interesting special effects, though the first storm scene doesn't really seem all that impressive. The humor is intermingled throughout, with good effect, particularly one owl in the beginning. The idea of the the role between children and adults comes out very starkly in this movie, a fascinating examination of their respective responsibilities and abilities that is revealed by the end of the movie, a somewhat unusual turn of events. Seven out of Ten Stars."
385,8,Based on my favourite book of the series,The Order of the Phoenix is my favourite Harry Potter book and the film does it justice. It retains its sense of mystery at an engaging pace.
386,8,Good follow up to The Goblet of Fire,"Harry Potter And The Order of The Phoenix is a follow up to the 2005 Harry Potter film Goblet Of Fire where Harry is been bullied by his cousin's gang and Harry saves Dudley(his cousin)from these deadly shadows. Of course Harry gets nightmares about Lord Voldermort and thinks that Voldermort is out for revenge again. While his dealing with Voldermort's comeback,the rest are still grieving for Cedric(Robert Pattinson) who dies in the goblet of fire by Voldermort and Harry keeps trying to warn everyone that Voldermort is back. "
387,1,completely absurd.,"I have tried in my mind's eye to separate the books from the movie - and I have found that it is simply impossible. Rowling did an absolutely amazing job on the books, and it is never reflected in any of the movies. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an 870 page book, however, apparently 138 minutes should account as a sufficient amount of time to place everything in the book that had any standing or was of any importance to the plot."
388,6,Never Fully Captures The Epic Moments From the Book,"Though undoubtedly a bit drawn out, the novel version of ""Order of the Phoenix"" does contain its share of epic moments. I thought that this movie version would be an improvement, as it would be able to separate the ""wheat from the chaff"", so to speak, and keep the action flowing. What actually happens, however, is that the movie never slows down enough to savor those great moments, instead pushing forward relentlessly from beginning to end."
389,8,He's back,"The movie is back and we follow Harry who have some problems since the tragic ending of the fourth movies. Harry have some problems with Voldemort and the resistance will be here to fight against him. Harry seek justice here to fight against Voldemort. He s against everyone: the government, the school. And the movie still have some great moments.:mysteries, revelations. The movie is prettg great and we feel that Harry will now shift in an young adult. Very interesting."
390,6,Struggles to juggle the emotional drama with the action,"Back in 2007, with the impending arrival of J.K. Rowling's seventh and final instalment novel and this, the release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Pottermania was at astronomical levels. A director new to the franchise was introduced, David Yates, who seemed a shrewd choice given his track record in British TV, but in hindsight, his inexperience with blockbusters proved slightly harmful to the franchise. It became difficult to cram Rowling's increasingly sprawling novels into a two hour-plus film, and Yates (along with fellow newcomer Michael Goldenberg penning the script), struggled to juggle the emotional drama so delicately handled by Cuaron and Newell before him, along with the CGI-heavy action."
391,9,If Only They Would Fit the Movies to the Books...,"A very enjoyable movie and a great addition to the series - but I left the cinema wishing that they would fit the movies to the books rather than the other way around. My kids and I know going in that there will be large holes where sections of the novel couldn't be included due to time constraints, and we're resigned to this fact, however there is always a disappointment when some scenes don't appear on the screen. At least half of the disappointment is due to the excellent job the various directors and producers have done with casting the characters of the series so far; you tend to expect to see everything rendered in cinematic images to match or enhance the pictures you formed when reading the book. For example, there are frequent comments comparing Richard Harris to Michael Gambon. Michael Gambon suffers the fate of coming second in place - after most of us saw Richard Harris in the first film and thought 'Ah! Yes - THAT's Dumbledore!' The cinematic image matched the one in our minds. Now Michael Gambon - doing an excellent job in his own right - yet doesn't look like the image we agreed on... Therefore when some scene is not dramatized, or some moment is left out there's this vacuum of missing images and I guess the only way around that would be to make two movies, for example, of this book (which certainly deserves two movies). In a way it's a pity HBO didn't pick up the rights since they may have done a more complete treatment of the stories. When I compare these films with their many fascinating characters and story lines jammed into a couple of hours with other recent 'blockbuster' movies that surely were cookie-cut out of plastic, I can't help feeling cheated. "
392,7,Grrr! That Woman!,"I absolutely HATE Professor Umbridge! I realise that I am not alone in this and in fact that I am not meant to like her, but Imelda Staunton does such a good job playing nasty in this film that I can't see her as anything else but Dolores.<br /><br />Her character is abysmal and the epitome of everything I hated about being at school and the stupid people that get in to positions of power. We've all had teachers like her and we all know others who are completely blinded by their own beliefs of wrong and right. I hate the injustice, the abuse and the unfairness portrayed hear, that actually makes my blood boil to the point that I struggle to watch the film as a whole, because she angers me so much."
393,2,Harry Potter and the Side Order of Fries,In this latest installment of the Harry Potter series the screen writer failed to read the book prior to writing the screenplay. It looks as if he opted to read the Cliff's Notes version. What was on the screen was not equal to any of the previous movies. 
394,7,One of the ugliest,"The film is one of the ugliest of the wizard, to save him there are only the fighting of Voldemort and the presence of a very well characterized villain, without these factors in the film would be perhaps the worst of the saga."
395,,The Worst Movie So Far,"I'm a huge HP fan, and I realise the need to cut half the book down when the pages just keep on increasing - however, was it just me or do these movies keep getting worse and worse? #1 was good, #2 was worse, etc,etc? The sheer annoyance generated by OotP has prompted me to comment, which is completely unprecedented. From the first 2 minutes into the scene with Dudley and the Dementors, you realise how pathetic the acting really is - without any depth, sensibility or charisma - even though obviously, Dudley is meant to be a fat dumb a**, Daniel Radcliffe gets paid to grunt and nod his head every so often, or yell pointlessly at a wall? Jeez! I don't know, but maybe the first 2 minutes just turned me off for the rest of the movie, which suffered from poor direction - while I realise this film is meant to be dark and building up towards the mood for future films/books, the direction was mediocre and pretentious at best, evinced on many occasions throughout the film - you hope that while you are watching it, it will get better, except it does nothing but sink you deeper into the abyss of crapness. Yes, go bag me out if you're a mindless HP zombie or a 3 year old kid."
396,7,order of the phoenix,"Order of the phoenix isnt one of the best harry potter films but it is a solid one,mostly what takes me out of a film was to much dream sequances and switch of harry character to even make him little unlikable even if a story requires that,the final battle was very good made and it showed as what we can expect in future films and it did solid way in build up the next instalasment also even if death of sirius black was sad i wish that film focused more on harry and his relationship and then it would make a bigger impact for us"
397,1,a sorry excuse,"READ THE BOOK , Please god read the book , this film was more awful than I could of expected , I could go into detail but i won't allow myself to relive it ."
398,7,Clearly made to be watched in cinema,"Good film, again not entirely faithful to the books, but constantly had to turn the volume up and down because it was either too loud or too quiet. My arm aches from constantly using the remote for two hours."
399,8,Harry Grows Some Chest Hair.,"It's blistering. Harry is overcast with lonesomeness, bullied by his abusive cousin Dudley, also in the testosterone throes of puberty. And this is when Dementors attack, those hellish soul-eaters, the terror keepers of the wizard prison. What they're doing here is unknown at present, but that's what makes it especially tense. Newbie director David Yates' refusal to go easy on his audience, regardless of age, is evident right away. There's magic here, but there's nothing saccharine or bright about it. This is magic as power, as an illustration of familiar human urges both dignified and horrendous, as something as real, bleak and patent as the tattered, graffiti-scribbled pedestrian tunnel, severely lit in gray-green, in which the Dementors assail."
400,9,Exciting Potter Advantage,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best Harry Potter films, a very close second to The Prisoner of Azkaban. Here is an exciting fantasy film, with the darker elements of Harry Potter being brought to the screen, and has additional character depth."
401,,lacks the joy and imagination of earlier films,"Latest chapter of the series begins with gifted young wizard Harry temporarily banned from Hogwarts for misuse of his power. When he finally does return, he tries to warn his classmates of visions signifying the return of the dark Lord Voldemort, but unfortunately his warnings are refuted by fussy old crone Dolores Umbridge, a bureaucratic new teacher who places a ban on all use of magic. Believing that he and his classmates may be in grave danger, Harry unites the Order of the Phoenix to prepare for a definitive battle against the treacherous Voldemort. The fifth installment of the series is enthusiastically performed but surprisingly uninspired; story isn't compelling enough to sustain the film's length, and there isn't much magic or adventure until the finale, but even then it's not very awe-inspiring. Die-hard fans of the series will probably enjoy seeing their favorite characters, but there isn't much to take in beyond that. **"
402,2,I almost left,"This is the only movie that has ever made me consider leaving in the middle. If you have read the book, do not see this movie. It leaves out the most important things in the book, and adds others that are entirely unnecessary. For example, Ron and Hermione's promotion to prefects is left out, Harry, Fred, and George's banishment from quidditch is left out, and pretty much the whole department of mysteries is left out. This was my favorite book in the series, and I was looking forward to this movie more than any of the others. Now I feel cheated. What should have been an amazing display of action and character building turned into a confusing and unreliable portrayal of the book. For those who haven't seen the book, many characters are added without explanation as to who they are or what their importance is. My friend, who hadn't read the book, came out of the theater with many questions that could have easily been answered with adequate directing and screen writing. I'm sure taking an 800 page book and turning it into a two and a half hour movie is hard, but the amount of things left out was not worth cutting time. The only reason I didn't simply get up and leave the theater was because I was looking forward to the battle at the department of mysteries. I figured that the reason so many things were being left out was so that the end could be accurate and full of the interesting things that were in the book. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and I came out of the theater wishing I had never went in. No thumbs up for this one."
403,7,"Decent adaptation, better at least than most of the others","After ""Goblet of Fire"" I wasn't so sure seeing any subsequent Potter movies would be really worth it, considering the books keep getting longer and longer and the movies, by mainstream default, must cut a lot out to fit comfy feature presentation time. However, enough people were actually pleased with this movie that I figured I'd give it a whirl, and it turned out all right."
404,7,"Dazzling and Dramatic, Harry's Fifth Cinematic Adventure is Among His Best","The boy with the lightning-bolt scar and his playmates return to Hogwarts for a fifth term, having sprouted almost overnight into young adults. Daniel Radcliffe has undergone the most striking change, filling out his robes with broad shoulders and a strong jawline, which ties in well with his character's pubescent bouts of temper and gloom. As the kids have matured, so has the filmmaking. This entry continues the franchise's trend towards the serious, both in plot and technique. Harry learns more about his parents' personalities, realizes they may not have been the virtuous angels he once believed, launches a private rebellion against a strict new professor and investigates members of the opposite sex. The school grounds feel more ancient and formidable, the dialog less fluttering and whimsical, the action scenes far better realized. That last note has been a trouble spot for the series so far, as it's struggled to master believable special effects over the years. They've finally managed it this time: the large-scale wizarding battle at the end of the film is head and shoulders above anything we've seen so far."
405,9,On par with the first four,"At a little over two hours long, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is tightly plotted, requiring at least an informal acquaintance with the first four movies. But it's also very well imagined, and what director David Yates did choose to show on the screen was more than sufficient to tell the story of Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts."
406,10,"No Flaws, Magically entertaining","Whatever happened to the delight and, if you'll excuse the term, the magic in the ""Harry Potter"" series? As the characters grow up, the stories grow, too, leaving the innocence behind and confusing us with plots so labyrinthine that it takes a Ph. D from Hogwarts to figure them out. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" still has much of the enchantment of the earlier films, but Harry no longer has as much joy. His face is lacking the gosh-wow-this-is-really-neat grin. He has internalized the secrets and delights of the world of wizards, and is now instinctively using them to save his life. There will come a time, I fear, as we approach the end of the series (one book and two films to go), that Harry and his friends will grow up and smell the coffee. They weren't trained as magicians for fun. When they eventually arrive at some apocalyptic crossroads, as I fear they will, can the series continue to live in PG-13 land? The archvillain Voldemort is shaping up as the star of nightmares. As for the cast, the ""Potter"" series has turned into a work-release program for great British actors mired in respectable roles. Staunton is perfect here as the Teacher From Hell. Helena Bonham Carter looks like the double for all three of Macbeth's witches. And then take a roll call: Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes (in the wings as Voldemort), Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Jason Isaacs, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, Julie Walters and the incomparable Maggie Smith. Her enemies include Harry's protector Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, looking as shabby as a homeless headmaster). Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) join Harry in fomenting resistance to Umbridge (sounds like ""umbrage""), and soon they are mapping clandestine schemes to defend Dumbledore."
407,6,"""There's a storm coming, Harry, just like the last time.""","Perhaps surprisingly, the Harry Potter franchise of films has so far remained relatively consistent in terms of quality, with each new director leaving their own unique mark on the series. Chris Colombus, known for his assortment of warm-hearted family movies, offered a warm touch to the first two films (respectively,'The Philosopher's Stone' and 'The Chamber of Secrets'), offering Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy an air of magic and wonder. As the stories gradually became darker, a new direction was needed for the films, and Alfonso Cuarón was an excellent choice to helm 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,' crafting J.K. Rowley's story into something bleaker and more intimate. Mike Newell's vision for 'The Goblet of Fire' wasn't quite so dark, and most certainly had a more epic scope on Harry's world, but this was used well by the filmmakers. The most recent addition to the Harry Potter series, David Yates' 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,' is probably the darkness film by far, and, despite perhaps being a bit underwhelming, there are certainly many good things to say about it."
408,7,HP5,"Quite possibly the most annoying film in the series thus far. Annoying because if you take away one incredibly obnoxious element then this may be my favorite of the lot of them. Solid character building, all the favorites are here, we finally get some proper wizard battling which was awesome, there's steaks and gasps and the whole thing feels really good except..."
409,6,I wish I hadn't read the book first,maybe I would have enjoyed this movie.
410,5,Big meh,Hp5
411,1,Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix,"With their warning about Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') return scoffed at, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts."
412,9,One of the best HP films,"It's the fifth installment of Harry Potter, and the characters are well into their teens. The fourth and final director David Yates has taken over, and brings even more changes."
413,9,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"I'll start with the downsides. In a few places it is a little cringey. That's all I have to say on that point. The film was great, the plot, of which JK Rowling must get all the credit was brilliant, naturally in a film adaptation some things had to be left out or changed but that's not a big problem. The film is another classic in the Harry Potter film saga, furthurmore I cannot find words to describe how perfect every actor and actress is in their role."
414,5,"Worth watching, just to see how it is","I expected this film to be good because of the popularity it made with its prequels. However I watched it, and I saw that there was nothing really special about this fifth part of the Harry Potter series. Don't get me wrong, the book was great, but I was disappointed with the way it was adapted on screen. They could have made it a lot better, as they did with the previous films. The relationship between Cho and Harry could have had more potential and a much clearer and cleaner ending, as it is in the book. But it's necessary to see the film to watch what comes next in the Harry Potter series. Let's just hope that the Half-Blood Prince will be better than this one."
415,8,Ah she is the worst,"And there she is, the most iritating character of Potterverse,miss Dolores Umbridge. I don't how Harry had patience with her and didn't just use Ava Kedavra on her. Because of her this is my least favorite Harry Potter film. She is main character and that is awful. I guess they will need new defense of dark arts teacher,again(there were 5 so far)."
416,3,Sorcerer grows well into teens and faces the dark side of self and enemies,"Let's face it, the first two Potter films were great fun. Then, as Harry grows, he moves into a nasty pre-adulthood, and the fun really tapers off fast. At the rate his life spirals into the doom of becoming an adult, he'll end up on a psyco-sorcerer's couch for intense analysis. This film is dark and moody, with next to nothing to redeem it. The visuals, as usual, are stunning. But that's where the kudo's ended for me. The characters we've grown to love in the first couple films -- Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon et al -- receive far too little screen time. Even Gary Oldman, who is perhaps one of the finest actors in the business, doesn't get the screen time he deserves either. The kids look awkward nearly grown up, and the humor, what there is of it, is somewhat strained. In this edition, the baddie is back, and Ralph Fiennes, another fabulously gifted performer, does a fair job in his role, or what little there is of it. Even when he does appear, the makeup is so intense it smothers any hint of emotive effort. Harry tries to get everyone to believe Voldemort has returned, but few take his side as politics interferes -- a veiled pot shot at US involvement in their present war? Soon Harry starts to train his own recruits for a cataclysmic battle, which never really comes in its implied fullness. In fact, this film offers nothing conclusive whatsoever, except that there will be another one coming soon. To this I say, ""turn up the lights, toss in some sparkle, add a little more humor, and let this kid grow group up without so many neurotic episodes to deal with."
417,8,"Good balance of drama with the political conflict between the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, humor, action, suspense and romance, in a beautiful and powerful film visually","The film has already started showing the dark tone that would be adopted from now on with the entrance in the direction of Yates. The Warner Bros. logo. and the name of the movie already appear surrounded by fog / smoke everywhere, and soon after it made a beautiful transition from mist to the sun in London and a panoramic view of a city park where they were Harry and his cousin Dudley with your friends that appeared to cause. After a change of time, the skies begin to darken and wind gusts begin to manifest, causing Harry and his cousin start to run to a safe place. At this time, in a tunnel, they are attacked by Dementors, and Harry must use magic to save them from the creatures. In these opening scenes we have to highlight the work of photography Slawomir Idziak that transform a sunny London town in a cold and misty with the exchange of palettes. The plan of Privet Drive when the boys are coming home that is used to tint green with contrasting black is visually amazing."
418,7,"Poor compared to the Goblet of Fire film, but still pretty good.","I have not been a huge fan of any of the Potter films except for the fourth, and this wasn't as good. This Potter entry deals with a new professor of the dark arts, Mrs. Umbridge coming on, and she takes over the school pretty fast becoming headmaster. Meanwhile Harry, Ron and Hermoine get an army of kids together to fight Voldemort who has returned. Like most Potter films, this doesn't explain itself enough, so quite often if you haven't read the books, this will have you scratching your head. The acting, as always, was very good and all the kids and old British actors did a great job. One good thing that this movie has is it almost has a small time feel. Though there are many scenes with special effects, it is nowhere near as special effect heavy as the the last four, and it also has smaller sets and less characters. Plus, this is a long book, and the movie runs at 128 minutes without credits making it the shortest of the movies. It was good, but it could've been better."
419,2,Not Good,"No matter how you defend the omissions in the Order of The Phoenix film, it still falls flat. But my greatest objection is to the alternative interpretation to the ending, very confusing, unfullfilling, too much liberty taken. If no other part of the book could make it verbatim, the ending certainly should have. I'm very concerned with how the next two films will be handled with Yates still at helm, as I think he is directing next one, no word yet on final film."
420,9,"The Shortest Move, The Longest Book, The Most Effective","After the 2005 adaptation of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", this franchise was going to get darker and fast. In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" ,is also where the imagination elements to it bears no limits and goes beyond the boundaries by making a movie primarily aimed towards the younger age demographics as scenes have become more intense, the characters have also become more mature and more advanced in their wizardry as the epic battles are more fierce than ever. Under the direction of David Yates, the energy level is exciting and unpredictable, the pacing is at a reasonable speed and pays homage to the darker and grittier themes that the book it is based on."
421,9,Favorite,"Normally I don't wait several years to comment on a recent film, simply because it is unlikely that many will read my comment. But the comments and reviews for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007) are generally so off-the-mark that a few supplemental comments could be of value. And hopefully my comments gain useful perspective from the distance of a few years since the release."
422,5,Eh,How do things like effects and acting get worse and worse as the actors get older and more experienced and technology gets more advanced?
423,10,The Best One Yet!!!!!!!,"I saw this at midnight and let me tell you it was well worth the wait. The actors all did an amazing job! One nice thing about keeping all of the original actors, is that you get to see how they've grown up and progressed as actors. But in this movie the acting felt natural. Daniel Radcliffe captured the emotions of Harry, Rupert Grint was absolutely hilarious. Emma Watson was perfect as Hermione. The Phelps twins, made me laugh throughout the movie. When they interrupted the OWLS or when they kept apparating just to annoy their mother or surprise Harry. Gary Oldman, was incredible as Sirius Black. Evanna Lynch, was perfect for the role of Luna Lovegood. Evanna captured Luna's spacey quality and her incredible perceptiveness. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Snape was brilliant. Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge was just as evil as the character in the book. As a fan of the books I was more than pleased with acting, cinematography, and the special effects. Although several things were omitted and the battle in the Ministry of Magic was condensed a lot, I was spellbound (no pun intended). The only downside, the next movie won't be out until November of 2008. This movie is incredible and absolutely surpasses the previous movies."
424,7,Rebellion,"Goblet of fire is my favorite one, order of the Phoenix is at least second favorite."
425,9,Best of the five movies,"I'm a huge Harry potter fan, books as well as movies and I can say I am not at all disappointed with this film. The movie was brilliantly made, and the dark feel was evident right from the beginning of the movie. What I was really happy about this one is it was more faithful to the book. The new actors like Imelda Staunton(played the role of Umbridge brilliantly), the young lady with potential Evanna Lynch who played Luna Lovegood and no need to mention the Bellatrix to the heights of evil."
426,7,Brilliant,"First of all and for the sake of the morals I hope that those who have a lip kiss are older than sixteen (both the characters and the performers -- actor and actress)-<br /><br />Besides that this is a brilliant and wonderful movie not much for the story but for the amazing special effects, images and scenes that we are already present in alll movies of the Harry Potter saga. The permanent fight of Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione against the evil forces of Voldemort. This time with the help of Proffessor Dumbledore. The magic is also very important and is shown in most of the characers' action. Very pleasant to watch indeed."
427,8,"Review: A bit long, but please read - You'll find it useful!","For starters, this movie blew me away because it was unlike any other Harry Potter film ever created. It was taken to a completely new (and impressive) level of darkness, drama, suspense, and even the acting didn't seem so ""rehearsed"" but indeed had a smooth flow throughout the entire script. And there's another point, the film was not based on dialogue, but more so on flashy camera angles which range from pictures and waves coming from Harry's mind and also used to narrate the story without using words. (Which cuts what I thought would be a potential extra HOUR of film) The epic saga of Harry Potter picks up right where it left off at Goblet of Fire, immediately following Cedric Diggory's death, and the return of Lord Voldemort. Miserable at Privet Drive, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself in a tight spot when he misuses underage magic privileges in front of evil cousin Dudley in their muggle hometown against of a pair of rogue dementors. He then finds himself facing an inquiry at the hands of Minister of Magic, Fudge whose main issue with Harry and his so-called ""act of self-defense"" is more rooted to the fact that he refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort is back. He puts his power as Minister to good use to have the ""Daily Prophet"" publish stories that DENY DENY DENY the return of Lord Voldemort and of course make Harry and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) out to be crack-pots."
428,8,Fabulous as usual,"Encore une super aventure de Harry Potter. Celle-ci prépare le combat final contre Voldemort. Ce monde fantastique est toujours rempli de beauté, de surprises et d'intrigues."
429,,Succeeds as a film adaptation with both dazzling visuals and (finally) good storytelling,"The actual events in ""The Order of the Phoenix"" are generally speaking outside of the explosive finale, the least interesting of those in any of the bigger Potter books (3-7), but the film version stands as, a week or so away from the release of the sixth film in the series, the best Potter film to date. I am absolutely flabbergasted at the criticism aimed at the film, particularly at director David Yates, whose TV work I enjoyed a great deal and who has made a pretty film here, and one which employs many cinematic techniques both new and old-fashioned in telling its story. While the narrative is again rushed I found the omissions and changes from the book made much more sense here than in ""Goblet of Fire"", and the storytelling to be overall superior to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" (where I think Cuaron chose dazzling visuals over solid storytelling at times). Good acting from most of the cast and really I found Yates' work to be quite exceptional. I trust he will do a bang-up job with the far better source material for the final three films in the series."
430,9,Congrats David Yates!,"In 1997 JK Rowling introduced to the world a small eleven-year-old boy who discovers that he is a wizard. Fast forward to today (seven books, five films later) this boy, Harry Potter, is one of the biggest phenomenons of today. With an amazing book series and four brilliant films to the résumé, will the newest film, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" still have that ""Harry Potter"" magic? To this reviewer's surprise, considering that the book was his least favorite, the movie was one of the best of the series."
431,9,A must see,"There were many things left out of the movie, that made the book an interesting read. HOWEVER, I loved the movie because it stayed true to the central plot of the book and carried that theme throughout."
432,,Hogwarts: Year Five!!!,"This movie is definitely better than the last. It has a better and more interesting storyline. It introduces new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix LeStrange (two very interesting female characters) The Ministry of Magic is in denial that Voldemort is back, and turns against Harry and Dumbledore. They appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher; a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic. She eventually takes control of the school, which causes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to start a rebellion against her and teach their friends how to defend themselves against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry and Voldemort will come face-to-face again when he is looking for a prophecy to kill Harry. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX!!!"
433,7,5 part of a series are one of the most boring,"5 part of a series are one of the most boring, except fight in the Ministry of magic and trainings of Dumbledore's Army there is nothing and to remember more. But the final in the form of battle of Dumbledore and the Dark Lord has turned out excellent."
434,9,"similar to previous sequel, not as good as first 3 ones","Nothing special to see in this sequel than what was expected. Maturing, story resolving, getting ready for more. Not as complicated or extreme as previous sequel, meaning more easy to understand and adapt to. This one and previous sequel can't be compared to first three ones, but still good enough. For example Dumbledore sounded more cool, authoritative, confident in 1st 3 sequels than in this one. Bit disappointing to not see Filch not reacting enough or explaining his behavior to listen to just about any headmaster or order, and some stories not finished like what happened to expulsion, final ratings of homes, cantaurs and Hagrid's brother..."
435,5,Music Matters,"Perhaps with Book 7 coming out a couple of weeks later, I never really was excited about this film. However, when I finally did see it I was pleased with some parts and very disappointed with others."
436,8,"Why the long face, Mr. Potter?","In the Summer of 2007, I went to Europe. I had recently grown a huge obsession with Harry Potter.Ever since the first film, the Potter films kept getting better and better. THe Goblet of Fire and The Prisoner of Azkaban were amazing films. THe day I left for Europe, the fifth film was released and I couldn't see it. I had high hopes for the fifth installment. Many weeks later I saw it. I was a little disappointed. The fifth book was the best book. The fifth film wasn't the best. It wasn't exactly the worst either, it was the Potter film that was in between. THe problem with it was that Umbridge lady. She was so evil...she was like Dick Cheney. She was even more evil than some of the other witches in the film. All she was was some British woman walking around wearing pink. The other problem was that Harry (the usually good Daniel Radcliffe) just walked around the school getting into arguments with people. I don't think I saw him smile once throughout the entire film, no exaggeration. I liked it the least for a long time. Then recently,before I saw The brilliant Half-Blood Prince again, I thought I'd watch them in order. Then I saw Order of the Phoenix again and was more impressed by it than ever. The cast was impressive. THe movie was impressive."
437,8,"Get to know Harry Potter, his friends and teachers, first in the books, then enjoy the movies. This movie is fine","If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying. "
438,7,"exhilarating, if somewhat flawed, fifth entry into the film adaptation series","Bringing an eight-hundred-plus-page novel that is full of detail and subplots into a compatible storyline for a film adaptation can be a difficult procedure. Especially when you want the film to still be a successful and compelling feature. No matter how poorly it was done, the film would make big bucks because it's based off such a popular novel. But ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not a badly-made movie. Yes, it's flawed and to a considerable degree. It's not perfect, but it's a mighty entertaining motion picture. In terms of visual excitement and heart-pounding entertainment, it's perhaps the best out of all five of the series. I can't say if it really is though, for it does have some flaws that I personally cannot overlook."
439,3,R.I.P Harry Potter,"When the first Harry Potter movie was released in 2001. It was a really good dark fantasy film. The second one was even better. But after that it went downhill and this one is one of the worst movies ever made. How much of the book did they miss? This is probably the most rushed book to movie film ever. This is even more rushed than The Goblet of Fire. and it didn't lead anywhere. The movie didn't explain much at all and I was just sitting there thinking ""what the hell is going on?"" The acting was also at a poor standard. After seeing this I don't think I will be seeing anymore Harry Potter films."
440,8,"New 'Order' is darker but still dazzling, enjoyable.","My Take: Darker than its predecessors and rather ordinary and rushed in quality, but it's still a magical and imaginative adventure. "
441,7,Disappointed and not what I had hoped .,"This movie was not what I had expected, yes , the special effects were good. But i believe that the movie had lacked a proper backbone , because , I , being a BIG Harry Potter fan and have read the books, have come to believe that the audience that has not read the book may not have fully understand this movie entirely. The movie , I believe seemed to be a bit rushed because the plot that was created seemed to end very quickly, hence back to when I had said the movie was rushed."
442,8,"Visually Impressive, More About Atmosphere And Character Than Plot","Much of this film is spent with not much happening in terms of plot - which is compensated for in character and the sense of people living in rh aftermath of tragedy and yet more darkness waiting to fall on them; though there's still room for joy and fun also. The last 40 minutes are an impressive action spectacle, full of visual strangeness and invention and the rising tide of more tragedy."
443,9,One of the Best Installments,"The fifth film in the Harry Potter series, Order of the Phoenix was great cinema. Based on the book of the same name by J.K. Rowling and a script by Michael Goldenberg. David Yates stepped in as the third director of the series (where he stayed until the 8th film) and did a spectacular job. The tone of this installment is a bit darker than the previous, but that's to be expected."
444,9,Yates' brilliance in finest ever Potter,Harry Potter (Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts to find the Ministry of Magic and their new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Staunton) are interfering with their education.
445,7,Too much story to fit into a standard length movie,"This film was an okay bridge to the next sequence of events. I guess all readers feel sorry for those who have only ""seen the movie"" rather than read the books... More than ever I would encourage anyone with a slight interest in the books but no time or inclination to read the hefty tomes to LISTEN to them on CD or tape or MP3. There is no way they could give anything more than a fast sketch of events for the last 3 books. This one felt a little wooden in spots simply because the characters other than Harry were given so little time on screen to develop their characters. I still enjoyed it but unlike the previous Potter films I don't have a special desire to see it again. Alan Rickman is still totally hot :-)"
446,10,The Good and Evil in Harry,"Director David Yates's ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" takes a distinctively dark turn, and is the most compelling of the Harry Potter movies. In ""Order of the Phoenix"" the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) returns, and the prophecy revealed regarding his bond to the emerging Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). Introspective and tortured Harry asks his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), "" What if I'm becoming bad?"" Sirius Black reassures, ""You're a good person We all have both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on."" Harry sees own his darkness. ""Harry Potter"" becomes classical hero mythology. Harry must use his powers for good and not evil, at the same time fearing that he maybe becoming that which he despises. In the prophecy either Harry or Voldermort will survivethere can be only one. Their destiny is intertwined and ultimately mysterious. During the climatic battle with Lord Voldermort Harry's mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells Harry (Radcliffe), ""It's not so much how you are alike, but how much you are not..."" ""Order of the Phoenix"" is engrossing I suspect like the J.K. Rowling's book, because it is about the conflict of good and evil within Harry. As Harry, Daniel Radcliffe is powerful and commanding."
447,10,Dumbledore's Army rises!,"Right where we left off from the ""Goblet of Fire,"" after Cedric Diggory's death the Ministry of Magic had scoffed the warnings of Harry and Professor Dumbledore that the enemy Voldemort is back, and they kept it hush-hush...OH BOY! So Minister Fudge had hired a new D.A.D.A teacher: Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic due to her belief that Dumbledore is forming a rebellion against the Ministry, what bull-s**t is that! At Hogwarts, Umbridge and Harry immediately clash, as she refuses to believe Harry's warning and forces him to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the skin on the back of his hand. When Ron and Hermione notice those scars, they were outraged and suggests that he should to go to Dumbledore; but Harry refuses. As Umbridge seize control over the school, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students (including a young, eccentric witch name Luna Lovegood) in defensive spells. Therefore calling themselves ""Dumbledore's Army."" That is all I could tell you. And I don't favorite a scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end; I thought Luna's cute."
448,6,Another solid offering but somewhat rushed and jumbled,"Just like it's predecessor, The Order of The Phoenix is unforgivably short and should definitely have been made into two separate films. Too much of the source material is neglected and we are left with a jumbled frantic mess of confusing plot leaps. The ending is actually quite difficult to follow if you are not well acquainted with the books, and if you are, you would no doubt be heavily disappointed with the telling of this story. The portrayal of Grawp is another huge disappointment that is completely unacceptable given the quality of the CGI throughout the rest of this movie."
449,7,Another good Harry Potter film...,"More than 10 years after the publication of the first book in the ""Harry Potter"" series, there's no doubt that J. K. Rowling's fantasy novels are on the way of becoming classics of the genre due to its imaginative world and its captivating story, which has gone from simple tales of adventure to darker and more complex themes as its main character, the young wizard Harry Potter grows up. The fourth installment of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" began this maturing process, as in that book our hero discovered that fighting against evil, embodied in the figure of Lord Voldemort, wasn't a child's game, as the forces of evil do not hesitate in killing innocents. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", fifth novel in the series, continued and expanded this transformation, and naturally, the movie adaptation followed the same path."
450,2,Harry Potter lost somewhere his magic,"What a disappointment! What an huge disappointment! I want my money back! Where did the true Harry Potter series go? I remembered films where you could perceive magic always and everywhere, you could feel an heart beating behind all that computer graphic, you could daydream watching the gripping adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. This time it's a complete failure. The story hasn't heart, hasn't point, hasn't characters you can relate and grow attached to. Why does Harry kiss Cho Chang? I couldn't feel any sentiment between them. Why did they push Ron and Hermione away? Ron and Hermione were Harry's moral support in every situation, they were the friends everybody wants to have. Now they're merely two flat figures without any personality: where did Ron's liveliness go? Where did Hermione the friendly swot go? Maybe they lost somewhere between the special effects. The pacing went too fast, luckily I had read the book, otherwise I wouldn't understand anything. The only things I liked were Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. They're perfectly cast and show remarkable acting skills: about Staunton and Bonham Carter that's natural because they're very good actresses, but about Lynch wow, she doesn't play Luna Lovegood, she is Luna Lovegood! Don't waste your time with HP5, go see something else."
451,7,"Must look ""squeezed"" to those who love the books, and probably even to others...","(Even) people who are basically supportive of the whole Potter concept who return to this film 12 years down the line may perhaps feel a little justified in asking quite what all the fuss was about! And a reasonable answer would probably be that the films garnered the praise - and earned the huge sums - they did back then, because they followed hot on the heels of the books, of which each successive film version had inevitably to be more and more of a fragmentary representation of what the author wrote (which also in fact began to be inspired by the on-screen characters in some amazing synergy)."
452,7,Potter still in good shape,"Harry Potter's saga goes on in a pretty good shape. New mysteries are revealed and the story approaches step by step to the final face to face between Harry and the Dark Lord. . As Potters grows up and becomes an adult so does the story, and now everything is darker and there's a bigger presence of evil and death."
453,8,Another good one!,"The Order of the Phoenix goes both ways for me each time I watch it. I either hate it and find it boring or I really like it and it doesn't bore me. This time around, I really liked it! Evanna Lynch is a great addition to these movies. I love how weird but enticing her character is. I think Gary Oldman is a fantastic Sirius Black. I still am really disappointed how the movie ends. Imelda Staunton is terrifying in her role. She really aces her part. The action is fun and gives you a good time."
454,5,I was disappointed...,"||Some spoilers I guess|| I'm not going to bother to write some huge long paragraph, but I really think they could've done better. Sure there were some parts that were hilarious (made more hilarious 'cause I went with my friends and stuff). But in total, they left out some of the parts I really liked (St. Mungos, and Firenze), and then they go and change some really important bits (Sirius' death)."
455,2,Wilted Wizzard,"No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I've dutifully taken my wife to all of these boring,dimwitted movies over the years. In my opinion, each one was a waste of film. The stories, centered around ""Hogwash"", are tedious, wretched, and self-absorbed. I'll never know how the books sold so well. My wife has read all of them. They're probably as ridiculous as the movies. This one in particular was awful. Hermione and Ron had no lines except to react to whatever Harry says. The dialogue is atrocious. My wife kept pinching me because I snore when I sleep and she was afraid the usher would ask us to leave. And what's up with the retarded giant who's tied to a tree? Yes, the gameskeeper has a retarded giant for a brother and although he's an adult, he wears a diaper and is tied to a tree. The special effects weren't that great. Centuars and other creatures bounce around so quickly, it's hard to appreciate their appearance (or or lack of). It was a crashing bore interspersed with zapping fireballs. Zapping fireballs get old and so does this mess of a series."
456,6,Good but too rushed.,I have said it once and I will say it again. You can not successfully make a book into a movie that is that long if you do you wind up with this where the movie leaves so much out of the book thats its almost a complete failure. Though Im sure if you never read the books this would be a fine movie but after reading the books these movies just seem more and more rushed.
457,8,Book fans will be disappointed,"My expectations going into the midnight screening of HP 5 were that not everything from the book would be in the movie. I learned this early on, seeing that even the movie based on the shortest book, Sorceror's Stone, did not include everything. However, what I did not expect was that vital scenes would be cut, hardly anything explained, and perfectly good story lines changed!"
458,9,Great movie,"If anyone thinks this movie is for 4 years olds, think again. This is the darkest and best Harry Potter movie yet! The battles were better and the acting has improved."
459,8,Stalwart sequel,This review contains spoilers.
460,6,Harry Potter and Teenage Angst,"""Harry Potter"" is an escape from reality. I love to sit down with a cup of hot chocolate and let my mind drift to the wizarding world. Of the first five films, this one has been the hardest one to get through. Though the core plot is strong, and I care about what is happening to the characters, the whole tone is a drag."
461,4,Take three cups of hot coffee with you or you are sure to doze off,"Now, after watching the trailer of this movie, I was mesmerized by the scenes of this movie and ignored the harsh comments of the critics. I and my three friends went to watch this film for Rs. 130 a ticket ( please don't convert it into dollars). But after watching the film, I and my friends too were completely disappointed by the lack of direction and the terrible editing. These are some or rather, many points which I did not like in the film: 1) The pace of this film. They could have made it longer, about two hours and forty five minutes, and added more information, it could be humorous or serious."
462,1,did J.K. Rowling read the scenario ?!?!?!?!?!?,"if you've seen this movie, can u tell me the story ?"
463,8,Another solid adaptation,"To me, the Harry Potter films are all solid, perfectly reasonable adaptations of J.K. Rowling's books. The cool special effects, stunning sets, and eccentric English character actors work together beautifully to bring the world of the books to life. Certainly, the movies are not as deep or rich as the books - but that's only to be expected, since they're shorter than the books by necessity."
464,6,acceptable but not Brilliant,"Given only two hours they managed to fit most of the important parts into the movie, character development was a letdown the movie lacked the meat of the book concentrationg too much on umbridge and less on the Order, Tonks was barley there the fight in ministry mad DA look weak and barley able to hold their own, where the book actually had some good wizard dueling not just a lot of flying smoke and the da scrambling for their lives. Neville got nothing but a look from Beletrix. Umbrige is easy to hate and a one book character, there should have been more effort on main characters, Luna was played wonderfully to character but what about Cho betraying the DA and no relationship at all between tonks and Sirius i guess in the next movie shell cry a lot but anyone who has not read the book will not have a clue why. all and all Read the Book watch the movie to get a little visual help, but don't be surprised if the next 2 movies aren't bare of important details as the books get longer and longer"
465,10,Good movie,"It was a great movie. It had a very interesting story, and it was well designed. The characters have grown up and are doing well, and that's great. The actors are great too. Bad and good characters are very well separated They made a very good point, and that was that bad people do not believe in good people."
466,9,Faithful Adaptation Keeps a Potterhead Spellbound,"(This review is written from the point of view of a Potter obsessive. You have been warned.) After months of anxious anticipation in which any screen-shot, trailer or other revelation was eagerly lapped up, here it was. The real deal. All around the world the avid Potterheads, (myself included) the casual fans and the people without a clue milled into cinemas to witness the latest installment in the Harry Potter saga. The film amassed a gigantic $44.8 million on its first full day at the Box Office, so Warner Brothers will be ecstatic, but what about the film itself? Is it any good? The answer is a resounding ""YES!"" "
467,9,great!,"By now the Harry Potter series won't need any explanation. Most people that will be seeing this film will have seen the films and/or read the books after all. Bookwise this fifth part is a HUGE part. About 1000 pages, the largest part so far. Filmwise this means a lot of information needs to be brought to the screen or trimmed away far enough that it disappears without too much consequence."
468,9,They Just Keep Getting Better and Better,"Harry Potter movies are the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. They aren't brilliant by any degree, but they are so freakin' entertaining and engrossing they have me on the edge of my seat like a pre-pubescent school girl. YAY! 'Order of the Phoenix', by...(read more) far the most captivating of the five movies, is completely satisfying from beginning to end. The entire cast is back for this installment and all are great as always. The stand-out of course is Academy Award Nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Chicken Run) who is absolutely delightful as the ruthless Hogwarts teacher who always has a giddy smile on her face. My only complaint with these movies is the fact that Harry Potter never loses. The movies never have an unhappy ending, and life isn't like that. I hope the next movie ends with Harry Potter defeated. Not dead, but just in a bad situation. They did it in the Star Wars saga with 'Empire Strikes Back', why can't they do it with this? What kinda message does that teach kids. That no matter what the good guys always win. Pbbt! That's bullshit, if you teach your kid that you shouldn't be a parent. Anyway, enough of my little bitch-fit rant, all in all 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' was a wholly enjoyable film that any Fantasy movie fan could appreciate. Will the next one be better? I dunno, I don't read the books. Grade: A-"
469,8,Rebellion is on the rise,I like this one poor Harry going through so much. The good part we are introduced to Luna Lovegood who becomes a lovable character. She brings gentleness to Harry's life. Couldn't pick a better casting than Evanna Lynch. Daniel Radcliffe's performance couldn't be better in this particular because he's more like the Harry character in the book. I enjoy he almost becomes evil but fights the evil in him. The flashbacks are emotional for me. And Ministry of Magic set is great also the epic battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore.
470,,"Advances the story, nothing more","Although the Harry Potter books are charming for kids and adults, this Harry Potter film contains none of that charm, not one bit. Fans of the series will surely understand what is going on but anyone who sees this as their first Potter film will be bewildered. Part of that is natural since it is part of a series, but some fault must lie with with director who once again shows that TV experience does not qualify one for the big screen."
471,7,Main characters seem to go AWL...,"(This is a review of the IMAX version, which has some 3D parts.)"
472,8,Definitely the Better of the Series So Far!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007, Dir. David Yates) "
473,6,Different from the first 4 movies,"This movie is not like the first 4 Harry Potter movies as the plot felt more serious and the tone is more darker. The plot was okay and was pretty much easy to follow, but I didn't find it thrilling like the first 4 Harry Potter movies. I felt like there was lack of fun and funny moments in the movie because the dark tone was present throughout the whole duration. Towards the end of the movie it felt anti climactic and the last fight scene didn't feel epic like in other Harry Potter movies. So far this my least favourite Harry Potter movie and I hope the next three movies are a bit more thrilling at least."
474,9,Fantastic.........,"I mean this was a wonderful, delightful Harry Potter film. I mean where do I even start? The film is just a turning point in the franchise. The characters they introduce are great and memorable. They do more mysterious things to keep it constantly entertaining. The world building is grand. The new teacher is a total prick and it works great. The acting from everyone is great, and the divide of the school on what Harry saw was really entertaining to watch. The special effects also grew quite a bit. They mixed special and practical effects greatly. Overall this was a magnificent Harry Potter film."
475,5,The worst in the series so far,It seems that this is a go-between movie. There are a lot of moments in the movie where they look back on things already happened in previous episodes. With this movie works up to a confrontation with Voldemort in a later episode.
476,8,Order of the Phoenix was a 870 page book needing a Part 1 and Part 2,"Things are indeed getting darker in the world of Potter. In ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" both the mood and color scheme are grim, gray and black. There is pink, as a matter of fact, but this belongs to the first female villain of the literary and film series."
477,8,Another Great Potter Adaptation (minor spoilers),"I will admit, as a fan of the books, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not my favorite book. I enjoy the book and like it as I do all of them, but the story of the novel I found a little murky for 870 pages. Anyway, I think screenwriter Michael Goldenberg did a good job adapting this monster novel into a workable film, although the film is a bit short and I would've liked a little more story to refine the destination of the film. But again, Goldenberg and his predecessor and successor Steven Kloves do not get enough credit for the tough job they have. The acting was outstanding, having raised yet another notch. Radcliffe is brilliant in showing the angry and emotionally depressed Harry as he is portrayed in the novel. Grint and Watson are once again outstanding as Ron and Hermione respectively, bringing a deeper emotional impact to the relationship of the trio. Imelda Staunton is amazing as the maniacally megalomaniac Dolores Umbridge, and deserves credit for her spot on portrayal of Umbridge from the novels. The adult cast was once again solid with particular praise going the Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is still a bit more aggressive than the novel Dumbledore, but is still portrayed well. Director David Yates does an outstanding job bringing out the emotions of the students in particular, especially with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The Department of Mysteries Battle is an outstanding scene of action, emotion, and tension, well directed by Yates. It may be the best action sequence in the films, only to the Third Task and Graveyard Battle from Goblet of Fire. As for visuals, outstanding once more, from the thestrals, to the sets of the Ministry of Magic, to Grawp. Overall, the film was better than I expected, especially with its short running time, and is yet another great adaptation of my favorite book series. This definitely the darkest film, and many of complained of the lack of magical pizazz from the first two films. Well frankly, the movies are accurately portraying the dark tonal shifts of the novels, and the excess fluff has been, thankfully in my opinion, left behind, as they have been done so in the novels. Again, Order of the Phoenix is one of two warm up novels, the other being Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, to the sure to epic Deathly Hallows. Am I Pottered out? Far from it, I only ask movie goers to be patient with these films, as they are necessary to build up to the exciting final installment."
478,9,Absolutely glorious.,"As a story, Order of the Phoenix is easily my second favorite of the series (behind Deathly Hallows). In the first four films we never really experience the true girth of the story at hand. It's all about the children developing into mature young adults who fully comprehend the wizarding battle and, more importantly, the danger of Lord Voldemort so that by the time we get to the last three stories they are prepared for battle against him and we can fully focus on the war at hand. There's always a great story/mystery with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and how they always end up being the complete opposite of what they appear to be, and of course the genius of Sirius Black's introduction in Prisoner of Azkaban always amazes me but the story always centers around the children and their growth."
479,4,"Wow, terrible and extremely boring!","This was easily the worst of all the Harry Potter movies. I don't know if I should blame the embarrassingly slow screenplay, or the terrible direction. The only reason it even got a four is because the film looked good and the acting (Daniel Radcliffe excluded, he was terrible)was because just about all the other actors were good. I have never read a Harry Potter book and never will, but this either was adapted poorly or it really is the weakest of the books because it made the worst film by far. Right now this has an 8.1 rating here, and I believe it is because of all the fan-boys that give it a 10 don't really base the film on it's ACTUAL merits. I would not recommend this film to anyone less than 13 years old. I wouldn't even recommend this to people that are fans of the book because it can't be any worse than this. I always feel that movies, yes even sequels should have some sort of conclusion to them. There is absolutely no sort of conclusion to this film at all; it is 2 hours and 18 minutes of setting the viewers up for the inevitable fight between Harry and the Bad guy! That's it and that's all? If you were to take out all of the special effects, there would have been nothing to take out of this film. The director David Yates, I have never heard of and hope that I never do again. It amazes me that they would trust a multi-billion dollar enterprise with a basic unknown. I know it did really well Box office wise, but that is just because of the Harry Potter name alone. If this was the first of the Harry Potter films, we would have never seen another one. If you do see this film, just watch the last 30 minutes and you wouldn't have missed a thing."
480,8,It's a pretty good movie but only succeeds as a Harry Potter movie,Directed by David Yates
481,6,Slower than the others,"I found this installment of the Harry Potter movies to be quite slow throughout the whole movie. Sure there were exciting bits, but not overall. I think if you added up the time actors were speaking and the time they were not, you would find a 50/50 split. The lack of action also made this movie seem like just one more installment."
482,3,I was left flat...,"--------Read this at your own peril------------------------ It could have been that my expectations were too high. It might have been that there was nothing new...oh sure, maybe a new face here and there, but the core formula is the same. Or maybe, just maybe it was that these characters...Harry, Ron, Hermine, et al, were no longer fresh in their respective roles...just going through the motions of an overly used, overly familiar formula. "
483,9,Another outstanding Harry Potter film,Simply brilliant.. a great mysterious action packed film. Even though their is a sad loss in this film you will still love it from beginning to the end.
484,9,An excellent Potter film,"I never have grown tired of this Potter film, in my opinion apart from the final two it is the best. It perfectly highlights the dangerous link between Voldemort and Harry, and takes viewers on a magical journey as Harry fights to find himself in this dark chapter. The final scenes are well acted and with Helena Bohnam Carter as Bellatrix it really makes the film thrilling and scary, giving a slight taste as to what fans should expect in the last Potter(s). Watching Harry Potter and Order of the Pheonix in cinema's made me realize as to exactly why i love all the Potter movies, it gave me goosebumps and the music was quite supportive of the theme too and i would recommend to all others if they have not seen this Potter then they are indeed missing out."
485,8,"Very Entertaining, yet Disappointing","First off, let me start by saying I have not read all of the books. I picked up the first 3 and loved them, but have made a horrible habit of not keeping up with the series. Ignoring that fact, I still make it a point to see these movies as they make their way into the theaters."
486,9,Best so far,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the best one so far. David Yates, the fourth director to take on the franchise, has upped the stakes considerably introducing a grander scale, epic feel and (even for Harry Potter) a considerably top-heavy cast."
487,8,Darker than Prisoner of Azkaban,"Yes, this is the fifth of the seven of Harry Potter. We get a dour chapter of the saga that features Harry facing his greatest challenges yet after the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire. It's no longer cute and fluffy like the first one but a serious installment where the Ministry is trying to cover up the return of a dark force and Hogwarts is under the thumb of a new so-called teacher and Ministry lackey. There are lots of scenes cut from the movie, but otherwise it's not too bad. Fans of this particular chapter may be put off by the cut-offs, but for me it was just fine. Will Harry and Dumbledore prove to everyone that the truth is out there? As philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke would say, ""Evil is only triumphant when good men do nothing."""
488,6,Voldemort Makes an Entry! 70,"Continuing my journey through the Potter World, and have now arrived at ""The order of the Phoenix"". The fifth film is among the absolute shortest in the series, while the book is the absolute longest (1001 pages) - naturally, as I've understand, they have skipped large portions of the book."
489,8,A great return in the series,"After a very bad 4th movie in my opinion, this 5th movie brought my interest back to Harry Potter. At most times very closely following to the book, the movie brings a great life back to the series. The acting improved tremendously, though of course could be improved more (Daniel acted SO much better this time around). The set I couldn't say anymore of, after the 3rd movie modified the set to such a scale it has kept it up perfectly. While the 4th movie cut out a lot of information and scenes, much of which fans wanted, this movie includes most of the key points and included the much awaited Voldemort vs Dumbledore fight in the Ministry. The special effects have been seemingly cranked up a notch since the last time."
490,4,"The actors are good, but the rest...","Today I went to see Harry Potter 5,"
491,7,Features The Best On-Screen Wizarding Duel,"Pros:<br /><br />1. The special effects (for the most part) not only holds up 14 years later, but they look incredible.<br /><br />2. The sound design is wondrous and does so much to inculcate the ubiquity of magic in the atmosphere - particularly during the last battle between Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /><br />3. The score, when used appropriately, adds a lot of feeling to the scenes. Whether it's light and bouncy or dark and ominous, and so on.<br /><br />4. The cinematography is fantastic. It provides really beautiful and stunning shots, in addition, the camera knows when to pull in and pull out.<br /><br />5. The creature design is mostly great, especially the thestrals which are utterly majestic and enthralling.<br /><br />6. There are brilliant performances by Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge), Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange), Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />7. The battle in the ministry of magic is mesmerising, intense, heart-breaking as well as being greatly choreographed."
492,8,Another steady step,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is everything we've come to expect. It's well-rounded because the story, acting, and filmmaking are all established. The script contains flaws, but stays true to the immensely popular book. Specifically, it's overstuffed and tonally inconsistent, but that can happen when adapting a large novel. It still follows the beloved characters, it deals with fresh conflicts, and it has serious loss. Plus, we get new dynamic characters and a new key location, deepening the universe. Furthermore, this material is elevated by the excellent cast because they have all gotten comfortable in their roles."
493,8,Less Wonder More Excitement,"While the dark mood and feel of this chapter in the Harry Potter saga may startle some, I thought the style and tone were a less of a departure from previous films, and more like the biggest step in the shift that began with Prisoner of Azkaban. I also thought that director David Yates the least well known of the directors in this series really captured the feel of the book and I look forward to his return for Halfblood Prince."
494,3,The worst one of all,"Wow.. I was extremely disappointed with this movie.. it was boring! The graphics and effects were good when they were used.... but I thought this movie was going to be SO MUCH BETTER. I'm so frustrated. Don't ask how but I never bothered to watch any of the trailers.. I never needed to, because the pure fact that it's Harry Potter I already knew I was going to see it. I have to admit there were parts that were very well done, but for some reason, this movie couldn't keep me entranced like the others did. I found myself checking the time every half hour or so just to see if I was getting closer to leaving. What's sad is, even though I thought this movie wasn't well done, I'm probably still going to buy it when it comes out so I can add it to my collection."
495,6,Solid entry into the Potter canon but no masterpiece,"Given its long, sprawling, complex plot, The Order of the Phoenix has often been regarded as both the least enjoyable and the hardest to adapt on film of any of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Bearing this in mind, the producers' decision to eschew any established or safe film directors in favour of David Yates, a man whose career thus far rests on well regarded, serious political dramas on TV, is a bold but potentially disastrous choice as director."
496,7,Surprisingly good.,"Summer has arrived but it's not something Harry liked, after what happened at Hogwarts before the holidays. What was meant to save his cousin from the Dementors resulting in Harry being framed (as usual) by his uncle and aunt while they take Dudley to see the doctor's. Harry had no choice but to perform the Patronus Charm before it was too late for his cousin as the Dementors were near Dudley. So, a letter came for Harry from the Ministry Of Magic to attend a hearing regarding what he has done."
497,7,Incomplete Story,"I loved the acting and directing in this film, and I thought that the effects were quite good, but the story was lacking, and the tone was too persistently dark."
498,,The beginning of the End...,The Order of The Phoenix is action Adventure at it's best. This movie has everything. Young Love Mystery Suspense And Fantastic battle effects . As this movie Unfolds Harry just starting his fifth year finds him self a target of attack by dementers. Suddenly Harry is escorted by some of the most powerful wizards alive to the headquarters of the order of the phoenix. Once there Harry is told that he who must not be named is back and on the warpath people are dying and it is the order's mission to keep Harry Safe. This movie pulls out all the stops and delivers a no holds barred action adventure tale of good vs evil with nothing to spare. Gary Oldman Returns as Sirius Black Harry's Godfather who is one of the original Phoenix members and Michael Gambon Returns as Dumbledore giving us a Very Different side of Dumbledore that we have never seen before. This is the movie All Harry Potter fans have been waiting for as it begins the end of Harry's war with voldemort. Things heat up and the action comes Fast and Furious.
499,1,Bad Movie,"Well. Just want to replace my previous comment on this Title. But changing comment doesn't mean changing the mark for this. Its still terrible movie after all. I don't know what happened. It seems this movie is like many trailer joining together. Why WB let Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus back, and why they let John Williams go. Music, Screenplay for this movie were totally horrible. I can't put mistake to the Director, because Director only Direct the movie based on the screenplay. Many importants points in the book were left. Even quditich match were not there. Sorry to HP fans.I'm a big fans for the movie and books. But I NEVER disappointed like this."
500,8,I loved it,A Harry Potter movie for the first time in the franchise's history seems almost overshadowed by the fact that the final book in this extremely successful series is due just over a week after the cinematic release of one of the book adaptations. However this brings nothing away from the fact that this movie will be extremely successful.
501,6,Cliffs Notes' adaptation of the novel,"I was so excited when this came out. I had high hopes, I read all 7 books, I had seen the previous movies. Even further, I went with a friend to the IMAX when this movie came out. I thought that nobody could screw up Harry Potter. "
502,7,Needed to be at least 15 minutes longer,"This installment of Harry Potter is the first one in which the filmmakers trimmed away virtually every subplot that was present in the huge book upon which it is based; only the main plot is served. A good idea I think. But, even though they cut the plot(s) to the bone, the second half of the film still feels rushed. It is about at the halfway point that the clear, focused editing of the movie turns choppy, with one sequence following another with little or no transition; I kept expecting the characters to get cut off in mid-sentence, but that never actually happened. "
503,8,"A solid movie, yet hardcore book fans might be disappointed...(SPOILERS ALERT)","Let me first say, that this movie is very good. The acting is outstanding, and the scenery and environments are all very good. The movie itself is good, yet hardcore book fans may be disappointed with some aspects of the movie."
504,9,Perfect Build up for the sequels,"This movie, just as expected, is great, super entertaining and presents to us the real threat that is Voldnemort. However, there is something which I dont like about this movie, I honestly cant say what it is, I just dont happen to like this movie as much as the 3rd and 4rth despite knowing all the good things. Its just a personal problem I dont know why I have."
505,,"Blast-ed out, v.00","A very watchable thriller that held my attention all the way through my first viewing. An okay achievement. I started with Harry Potter in March 2005 and this is nothing like the same, just it was still very watchable."
506,7,Mid series filler...,"As enjoyable as this was it all felt a bit... ""filler"" - like its laying groundwork for events to come. There's nothing wrong with that of course, but there was no real payoff or any major revelations. Still, Delores Umbridge was an excellent love to hate character, and the final fight was entertaining and carried weight. A decent enough entry, but not as good as the previous two..."
507,10,Favorite of the series,This one is my favorite of the Harry Potter Series it was lot of fun i loved it
508,2,Absolutely terrible,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and had a lot of expectations coming into the theater tonight. Wow. When I left I felt angry and disappointed. I disagree with everything the director chose to do with this movie. Besides from the content omitted from the book that I think was crucial to having the story come alive with the detail that makes J.K. Rowling's series so fantastic, the whole feel of the movie was unlike any of the others. The hand held camera scenes were as distracting as the unnecessary flashes of excessive light. The swooping in scenes with newspaper headlines was pointless and hard to watch. I did't want to feel like I was on a roller coaster while trying to read a magazine (my sentiments towards the whole movie really), I wanted the director to put me in a magical world on the verge of a war. Instead, I was forced to watch Hogwarts lose some of its zeal in favor of the director's personal whims and license with the superb text of The Order of the Pheonix. Overall, I found this lackluster and a supreme failure given the story that it was trying to display. I hope the next movie deals with the book and story more than ease of writing in special effects and 'cool stunts' that are not in the book. A terrible chapter in an absolutely phenomenal series of both books and movies."
509,6,Its better than Goblet but by far is still mediocre,"Of course harry potter fans will flock to this film but from an Oscars point of view? The Harry Potter films are probably at their best in music (not Goblet though), and special effects. It is always hard to translate from book to movie. The Harry Potter films are nothing to be ectatic about, the first two were at best mediocre. The third was perhaps the most boringst in climax but it made up for that with its style that proved to be more magical and medieval. The fourth was a big mess where it seems very depressive and the magic is somewhat gone. The fifth movie stands somewhere between, it is dark yes, but it has lost all feeling of magic. No Oscar worthy performances here. Everything is solid in this latest film, but it fails to be a phonomenon like Return of the King. I believe the 6th film will have around the same attendance as this film with the 7th probably being a blast. It is still good entertainment though, its better than most films out like Pirates 3 or the heavily overrated Spiderman3. I would rather watch this than The Simpsons movie or transformers (which was very dull and only gains box office from popualrity.)"
510,7,David Yates directs the series to a darker atmosphere,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is the first of the last four Harry Potter films to be directed by David Yates. This works well in my opinion, as the atmosphere across the last four films felt highly homogeneous."
511,9,Order Up! 'Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix' Delivers a Spellbinding Storyline,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a thrilling and emotionally charged addition to the Harry Potter film franchise. The movie expertly captures the darker tone of the novel, as Harry and his friends fight against the oppressive Ministry of Magic and the return of the powerful Dark Lord Voldemort."
512,5,Upsetting adaptation! Great special effects!,You take all the great points of the book and you get this movie. It was easy to hate Umbridge as the actress made the character pure evil. A bunch of points are left out entirely (ie. the house elves; something that is vastly important to Hermione and Ron in Deathly Hallows).
513,6,Succinct in Sixteen,A fun addition to the film franchise which butchers a lot of excess from the book.
514,7,Order of the Phoenix Not True to the Book,"You can tell that the screenplay writer, Greenberg could NOT have thoroughly read and digested the previous 4 stories. While the movie was good on its own, it omitted potentially entertaining and vital scenes from the book. Most notably were the numerous exchanges in the book between McGonagall and Umbridge, the swamp spell perpetrated by the Weasley twins, and the animosity between Umbridge and the Centaurs. And Firenze was totally omitted as the replacement for Trelawny! OMG, how could THAT be?? I'm relieved that Steve Kloves is doing the screenplay for Half-Blood Prince. The integrity of the overall storyline SHOULD be restored with the return of Kloves' writing talent. As others have said, while I'm a fanatical fan of the series, Order of the Phoenix was the least successful transition of book to film."
515,5,Gone is the magic,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment based from J.K. Rowling's wildly popular series of a young wizard's adventures in the magical school of Hogwarts, feel much more an obligatory splice between its predecessors and the impending eventuality. For fans who have loyally followed the series, it's temporarily stopping an itch before the final book comes out. But for anyone else, the film is an emotionally inept and borderline drab for most of its running time as the narrative feels crammed just as to cover all bases before going to the final two films."
516,10,Smokin' Hot Wand..,"I have never read the Harry Potter book series but I have watched the movies, and I am now sure that this was the best one out of the others. Never had I seen a fight with Dumbledore and You Know Who. I really liked how the professor was trying to take over the school and in the end, she gets the punishment she deserves, also it was pretty funny."
517,8,Quite possibly the best of the series,"It's quite amazing to see the direction the Harry Potter franchise has come since the cheery, yet unyieldingly faithful Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Although liberties have been taken with the text, with things shifted around or deleted altogether (with the source material over 900 pages, I hardly think anyone's complaining), the latest installment of the Harry Potter series offers some of the most entrancing moments of the year."
518,8,Yates' pacing wins it over.,"Director David Yates replaces Mike Newell in the directing position on the Potter films and gives the Potter series a victory. This book was the longest, which makes it incredible that Yates squashed this down into the shortest of the film adaptations. It does not feel squashed together though, Yates understands our need for a good pace and that is what he incorporates into his filmmaking here. His direction is not as fragmented and uneven as Newell's and he does everything Newell tried to do in The Goblet of Fire, which is getting down the emotions of the characters while telling his fictional fantasy tale. The Potter series may have found a director yet, other than Cuaron."
519,8,"Unexpected Changes Gives ""Phoenix"" Fresh Twist","Following the unexpected early dark turn in the film series with ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" I quickly got skeptical if the last four films would turn out good. I'm pleased to say that with the next two having come out since the summer of 2004, they're halfway home- and David Yates is the best director yet in bringing out the Harry Potter magic on the screen, something that Chris Columbus and particularly ""Azkaban"" director Alfonso Cuaron failed to do. Where ""Goblet of Fire"" improved in displaying the magic and focusing more on Harry's story, ""Order of the Phoenix"" did even better. "
520,4,every movie is worse,"Well Harry potter is in his fifth year at Hogwarts and these time they will have to face the fact that Voldemort is on the strike again, despite the fact that the Minister doesn't want to recognize this. Well, it is interesting to remark the fact that, as long as the books are better the movies are worse. In the fourth one, we only saw the tournament and well it was not bad, these time there's a bunch of things that happen together in the book and the movie doesn't focus in any of them, then, there's no concrete plot, as the movie wants to tell lots of things but tells any. None of the stories are well developed and it i hard to follow how the movie goes. In addition, the special effects, that used to be impressive, this time are just invisible, there's almost any scene where they are the most little astonishing. Only the fight in the Parlament is decent, but we have seen lots of this before. Unluckily for Potter's fan, this movie is not good, I hope that the next are better. Anyway, is Harry POtter, it is still enjoyable."
521,9,Would've been perfect if not for one error:,"This was easily the best movie of the set to this point. They changed a lot from the book but almost all of them worked well in the scope of the film. The acting was the best it's been yet, the plot developed really well, and the darker cinematic vibe was perfect for how Harry was feeling throughout the book. Honestly, there was really only one negative and it's something they changed from the book so if you haven't read it you might not mind at all. As I said before, ""almost all"" of the changes worked well. This particular change, however, is being looking over. In my opinion, the most intensely emotional and dramatic sequence in all of the first five books happens in Dumbledore's office after they all returned from the Ministry of Magic. In that moment, the emotions of what took place at the ministry almost literally pour out of the pages. The director felt, I suppose, that this gut wrenching portion of the book was sufficiently covered in a mere 30 seconds of filming where Harry and Dumbledore barely scratch the surface of what occurred in the actual book. I think this scene should've met the book completely. Only then could they have done it justice. Without that flaw, however, the movie would've been darn near perfect. I hope the movies continue to get better and better."
522,8,Not as depressing as the previous one :),"The previous movie was slightly depressing I'd say. It was very well done as I said in the review, however it was sort of dramatic and ended without much of a high note. However, this movie continued the story and ends up with a high note, to me. It's obvious the story has yet to finish, however seeing the characters become more aware of this, and interact with the plot more, is what makes this movie a bit better than the previous."
523,6,"Entertaintment - Definitely, Fun -No Way, Children Friendly - I Don't think so!!",There was a time when movies that were supposedly targeted at children were simple and fun.
524,7,"""Haven't you always wondered what the connection is between you and the Dark Lord""",The Order of the Phoenix was and is my least favorite book from the Harry Potter series. It was way too long and it suffered pace issues. Thankfully this all disappears in the movie. The 'keeps getting better and better every movie' thing that was going on stops here. This is my third last favorite HP movie. Coming up behind POA and GOF.
525,8,to appreciate both mediums you must understand the limitations and advantages of both film and literature,"I've read all 6 Potter books and all 5 Potter films so far and to appreciate both mediums you must understand the limitations and advantages of both film and literature. Not everyone can be expected to do this, so there will always be misinformed displeasure for one or the other form."
526,7,"Good, but could've been better - new director please for the next one","I know, there's already nearly a thousand comments on this film.... however, I wanted to add my minor quibbles on the things that disappointed me a bit and could be improved for the next few films."
527,9,Impactful installment with emotional aftermath,Rating
528,7,Still Passable fun but not as good as the other four films,"Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is still passable fun, but I found myself slightly disappointed with the movie. I know that a lot in the book was kept out of the film, but I believe all the main points were covered, so that is not my problem with the movie. My problem with the movie is that it has lost a little of the magic that made the first four films very good. In my opinion, it's become more of a drama and has lost some of the fantasy touches. Even the teachers, which helped to make the first films so good, have simple cameo parts that last only a few seconds or so. However the three main stars, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint are still very good."
529,,"Not only the second shortest, but also the second worst film of the eight","Voldemort is back. That was the awesome cliffhanger Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ended on and story-wise, there were loads of possibilities for the follow-up in the series. However, Order of the Phoenix does not do what one may hope for and zeroes in on its protagonist's puberty. Since this is a franchise accompanying kids through their full adolescence, it's only reasonable for writer Michael Goldenberg to give weight to this, I guess, but that didn't stop me from being quite disenchanted while watching the film."
530,4,Garbled and unfocused,"To this non-reader of the book, the plot line in this film hardly made any sense at all. There is a great fuss about 'a prophecy' Voldemort needs to get his hands on, but what it is or why he needs it remains unclear almost until the end. And once found, it basically appears to dispense the tacky morale that Voldemort is the true weakling because he'll never know love or friendship. That eventually either he or Potter must die is again not an insight that seems to require any great prophetic gifts. Before these stunning pieces of wisdom are revealed, towards the finale of the movie, the viewer has sat through a prolonged but lame attempt to psycho-dramatize HP. Though Potter ended up as the hero in each of the previous movies, we here find him all of a sudden an inexplicable outcast, old friends suddenly picking fights with him. Are his buddies that fickle? Themes of loneliness and first love crop up, but are handled in a hackneyed and rather embarrassing way. There's much ado about The Kiss, yet at the first setback HP apparently drops his girlfriend like a brick, and without a question asked or a word of explanation offered. The adolescent shouting matches might have been just bearable hadn't the acting been so wooden."
531,3,Worst Potter movie to date,I am a big fan of J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series. I have read all of the books of series (some of them twice). I am sorry to say that this movie falls far from the mark of what I am used to seeing. The special effects were sub par. The final fight scene in the ministry of magic was mediocre at best. It should have been twice as long and more detailed. The fight started and Sirius was dead in like 30 seconds. I would of liked to see more of him dueling before they killed him off. There was a few high points in this film. I was glad to see all of the original cast back.(minus Richard Harris the original Dumbledore).Also the actress they got to play Delores Umbridge was excellent. If you are planning to watch all the movies in the series than watch this if not don't waste your time.
532,6,Harry Potter,"Harry Potter series is quite popular for teenagers and adults too. It became live-action which is great. The first movie, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone, is not very good as the fantasy is quite mild but as the series go on, from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating, it is getting more darker. This movie is the newest Harry Potter movie, passing on to the fifth year for Harry Potter in Hogwarts and Voldemort is back, finally gets to show magic powers. There too are new characters as for Dolores Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, a new villain and Lunna Lovegood. With all these new characters, Harry Potter will have face more difficulties. Harry Potter movies are just the short version of the long-pages books. For me, I prefer to watch than reading long stories."
533,8,The more intense darkness,"This movie, about Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore's warning about Lord Voldemort's return who were scoffed at, that they are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts, is a great fifth installment of the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011)."
534,10,~*-He's back!-*~,"Warner Brothers proved themselves worthy of yet another well done ""Hary Potter"" movie. The movie manages to capture everything in the book, except minor subplots, but the story continues and the director did a great job, I'm happy he'll be making the next movies also. After all those style changes from the first movies, the fans of the movies need to focus on the story rather then the new uniforms, or other things directors usually change."
535,8,Magical with very little magic,"Consistency oddly both enhances and takes away from the Harry Potter experience. Like the books, the films have a built-in structure that allows for them to not bother with coming up with fresh ways to start and finish each film. A new academic year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry begins and ends with the film following suit. While this familiar structure doesn't allow for surprise, it is the adventures the take place between these two bookends that define each film. And despite a new rule of conservative values and repression falling upon Hogwart's, it is the constantly appreciative and awed faces of Harry, his few friends, his professors and the legions of fans watching that make HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX one of the most solid in the series. Being a part of one of the most successful film and literary phenomenon of all time has not jaded a single player in the least. Doing justice to a lushly imaginative world without making itself into something more serious than it is and managing to have fun while working hard has allowed Harry & co. to find a comfortable, satisfying stride."
536,9,A nine?!,"The movie is a solid 8 the whole way through. I believe this is one of the best paced films. It totally throws out the book storyline, which is a bloody relief because the more creative freedom a book to movie adaptation gets the better it becomes."
537,,What's all the fuss about?,"The Harry Potter franchise is, to be quite honest, rather over-hyped. This fifth instalment was full of endless teenage angst moments, which bored the hell out of me. The acting, particularly in so-called 'emotional' moments, was moribund at best. The film features surprisingly little magic for a film about wizards; rather, it dwells on never ending references to the baddie, who turns up at the end of each film for a ding-dong with Potter. Boo-hoo. The special effects had all the panache of a squashed orange. So what happens in this film? Well, not much. Harry uses a spell in front of a 'muggle' which translates from geek to standard English as 'non-magician'. The powers-that-be get all hot and bothered and say he's out of Hogwarts. Sadly, he doesn't seek gainful employment, but weasles his way back in, as if there was ever any doubt! Harry bags himself a filly, for a snog, but seems to have eyes for some Irish lass as well. On the whole, a very poor effort this film: JK Rowling is one of those champagne socialists who's lucked into a few hundred million because people are so easily pleased."
538,9,Order of the Phoenix Review,"After the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry and Dumbledore are said to be lying about the return of Voldemort. This causes the ministry to lose faith in Dumbledores ability to be the headmaster at Hogwarts. To correct what the ministry believes to be a failing wizardry school, they place Dolores Umbridge as the defence against the dark arts teacher, in hopes that she can correct the school."
539,1,I'm so very disappointed in this movie. It SUCKED.,"I am a fan of the series, both book and movie, and am incredibly disappointed in this movie. I was ready to walk out 15 minutes into it, but stayed hoping it would get better. It never did."
540,7,so fun,"They made my least favorite book my favorite movie, it is so fun and lucky for us, not as long as the book's plot."
541,8,Potter movies getting better and better.,"I've not read any of the books. I wish to make that clear from the start of the review. The books didn't appeal to me when they first came out, but being a movie geek I have seen all the movies."
542,4,Disappointing.,"First and foremost I will begin by saying that I am not a reader/fan of the Harry Potter books. Never have been, never will be. With that aside, I found this movie to be utterly disappointing. Sure some people will argue that it is the best Harry Potter movie. But come on! What is so great about it? The acting was off, almost mediocre, the believability of this was just ridiculous, and to top it of the whole story had no plot."
543,7,"not a great movie, but a good companion to the book","This just did not work as a movie. Being a fan of the books and having read all of the books I am quite familiar to the world and the storyline. For those who have never read the books though this movie is a mess of story lines that just does not make sense. Having read the books and this one being one of my favorites, it was a great movie because it showed things that I loved to see. Luna Lovegood was perfect and was more perfect than I could have imagined. That little actress was so good I could not believe it. I really felt for the character and thought of how great it would be to have her on your side. The wizard battles were totally awesome, but could have been longer and showed some more action. I wish I saw the statues come to life in the last battle like in the book, but they did not. The statues looked better in the movie than I had pictured, but they did not spring to life. I don't want to say none of the kids in the movie can act, but I think they were just given with some pretty weak material. The only reason this movie gets a 7 and not a 6 is because one of the best characters in the book came to life in a such a way I could not imagined. A really big beef I had with the movie was that they left out my favorite scene in all of the books. The one where Neville is with his parents in the hospital grounded the whole world and gave the kids something to fight for that everyone can relate to. There is no destiny involved with Neville's character and he did not deserve the life he was handed. He deserved to have the loving parents that were taken away from him and the movie almost ignores that part totally. Neville was turned into my favorite character in that moment and now he just another silly kid who has a reason to fight, but we aren't able to see into his character like the book let us. Like my summary says it is not a good movie, but having read the books it was really nice to see the world we have come to love."
544,10,Excellent Movie!,I loved this movie. This is one of the two best Harry Potter movies. The only thing is they don't show very much of Hagrid. I thought it was sad when Sirius died. He was a great godfather to Harry.
545,9,Brilliant - Near Perfect Adaptation!!!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is currently my favorite book in the series. Having watched the film, I have to say, in my opinion the adaptation is near perfect. I was surprised that the director condensed such a long book into such a short movie. I feared the movie would be fast-paced like the opening scenes of Goblet of Fire. Order of the Phoenix is far from that, moving at an almost slow pace. The director successfully translated the dark tone of the books into film. He director artistically and masterfully crafts the film, rather than simply regurgitating the book as the first two films did. The movie feels almost claustrophobic, squeezing viewers into the tiny hallways of Grimmauld Place and presenting them with a Great Hall that seems not nearly as vast as in the first film. As the film differed from the book, I felt that almost all of the changes were justified and made for a better telling of the film on the screen. Overall, I was particularly impressed by the first and last scenes of the film. I recommend this film to fans of the books, and to older fans of the movies. I feel that small children may not enjoy this movie as much, since much of the light hearted hocus-pocus is absent from this dark installment."
546,8,Nice one,"This is a very interesting movie,with a very sad ending in my opinion.Acting is very good from everybody and you have Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge,a truly despicable woman.Nice book and movie,despite most of the book has been cut.8/10"
547,9,"Very good. Surpases the book even, but GoF is still the best movie.","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who is getting better and better) enters his fifth year at Hogwarts, and a shadowy threat grows outside and within the school walls. The threat outside is in the form of scary @ss Voldemort (played by scary-@ss Ralph Fiennes). The threat within is pink, obnoxiously evil Doloros Umbridge (played to horrifying perfection by Imelda Staunton), a plant from the Ministry of Magic who believes that Albus Dumbledore is trying to use wide-spread fear of said Voldemort to usurp said Ministry of Magic. Harry and his classmates rebel from the imperialist thumb of this woman by forming a Defensive Magic club."
548,10,He is back I tell you,It's year 5 at Hogwarts and another increase in the darkness we begin to feel. There is also further growing up of our Harry and friends with romance taking a small instep.
549,1,an appalling thoughtless rendition of a great book,"Simply put Yates absolutely butchered all the potential that this film held. This harry potter film is by far the worst film of the series, even toping my top three for worst book to movie films in history. I would say that all true harry potter fans will find this film absolutely despicable and appalling. ""Director"" yates turns this film into a cheap, tacky, and insulting rendition of the potter book. Throughout the film there are such blatant derivations from the crucial elements of the plot that it appears Yates has not even read the entire series. Harry potter is such a huge phenomenon in our present day that a competent director should have been assigned the honorary duty of creating this movie. Yates takes the wonderful work of JK Rowling and simply ignores he backbone and foundation of the magical world that she has created. He creates a movie of his own, apart from the story this movie is supposed to follow. Alright the very very basic elements of plot are there, but everything else is a disaster. He changes the power, characteristics, and personalities of numerous characters, simply disregards many elements that Rolwing has strategically placed in the novel (death eaters who can turn into black smoke and fly around??? are you serious?? this seems laughable to real potter fans im sure but it indeed happens throughout the entire film). And since when can wizards do magic with their non wand hand without a wand, or with their walking stick? And the dumbledor voldermort battle which should have been so easy to make stunning, powerful, even moving... it is completely mutilated, reminding me of the cheesiest movie of all time X-men 3, from which yates steals a move that he has voldermort use ( the glass). Yate's disregard of Rowland's work is appalling and it is unbelievable that for over a year the huge staff of this movie permitted such an atrocity and shameful attempt at a harry potter film continue. So my words of wisdom are thus: if you liked the book of the series do not see this movie for your own good. I would be amazed to find that Yates has even read all 6 books before making this terrible movie. Its a plottless, thoughtless, boring, cheezy, uninteresting, waste of life and money of a movie that will upset any true potter fans. a 10 year old fan could easily direct a much more satisfactory film than this piece. one word: ATROCIOUS"
550,8,He's back!,"After 4 film teasing the battle between good and evil, we finally get to see some pieces moving and the battle get underway."
551,9,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Review,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a film directed by David Yates. I remember watching this film back in 2007 since my school took me and not understanding a single word of it. But finally after watching it so many years later, I enjoyed the film."
552,9,best and great,"Harry potter is one of the most outstanding movie of all time.man i just ca not express my feelings that how much i love HR.when i watch it for the first time in 2016 i just totally amazed with this kind of movie and and i totally obsessed with it every time.what a story,characters,settings and especially daniel radcliff's acting.what a amazing movie this is.naive and innocent acting of daniel radclifff's makes me humble every time.each characters each and every character is lovable.what a movie is this."
553,5,Superb book is turned into a disappointing movie,"The Harry Potter series is very well-written, almost genius on the part of J.K. Rowling. This movie served the fifth book no credit, and almost ruined it completely. It was nearly all action throughout the whole movie and was very confusing for viewers who had not previously read the book."
554,7,The second-best movie in the series.,"After a summer of movies filled with second, third, and fourth sequels, the most anticipated follow-up is finally here, and it is a fifth installment. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the story of Year Five at Hogwarts for lead characters Harry, Hermione, and Ron, although a large portion of the movie occurs outside the grounds of the teens' school. More than a children's book, this episode builds upon strong themes of fear and friendship to create a solid piece of cinema."
555,8,Great Movie- Gives the Book a Bad Name,"If you have read the Harry Potter books and loved them just as much as i have, you should probably agree that this was the worst Harry Potter film (COMPARED TO THE BOOKS), besides that I enjoyed it. When Harry and his friends finally reach the door in his dreams, they go directly into the Hall of Prophecies, though in the book they go through a variety of rooms, and that is a part I was most eager to see. The room with the brains, and the time room. Also in the book,almost everybody but Harry got injured in the battle, while in the film, no one gets injured. Also, in the film, they rearrange things and combine things that I don't think they should have. The sacking of Trelawney takes place almost directly when Umbridge becomes High Inquisitor, when in the books it doesn't take place until after Christmas. Also, they do not show the St. Mungo's scene at all, they do not even mention it, and they leave out the attack on Hagrid and McGonnagal. And the last thing that really upset me was the fact that in the book Bellatrix DOES NOT hit Sirius with Avada Kadavra, He only gets knocked into the veil. In the movie she does hit him with the killing curse, sending him into the veil. But I still believe Sirius is alive (LISTEN TO WHAT LUNA SAYS AT THE END!!!) Therefore, in my opinion, they film makers left out way too much, and I think for those who haven't read the book will find this movie hard to follow. Also I believe that this movie is way too short- 2 hours and 18 minutes, not enough time for an 870 page book. I enjoyed the movie but I think they were a great disappointment to those who read the books."
556,9,Great Movie,"This is movie is going to blow everything else out of the water this summer. I loved this movie, the 2+ hours went by quickly as the movie keep a quick pace,at no point did I feel as if they were just dragging the movie out. The Order of the Phoenix, is a movie that all will enjoy. I think even people who haven't seen the previous, four movies will be able to enjoy this one. I can't wait until the next one hit the screens. J.K.R. is a great writer, as we progress in her stories they seam to get better and better and when they conclude I think that we will be able to say that this has been among the very best series of books and movies ever. Go out and see this movie as soon as you can, and if you haven't seen the last four go out and rent them and then go and see the Order of the Phoenix."
557,6,"Not as good as Goblet, but still mostly enjoyable.","Goblet I thought really took a step forward. This film sort of did, it has promise, but overall it feels like filler to build up for the later films. The first half is about a government conspiracy to shut up Harry who's talking about Voldemort returning, then it jumps to the second half about training for the battle against Voldemort like the second half of Rocky. I liked the whole idea of the government not wanting to start a panic, so they're denying the inevitable, but after it goes to training it's just training scene after training scene, the only thing we're missing is a montage."
558,7,"Action, Drama, Magic","I have to say, I have not been disappointed by the Harry Potter Film Series yet. This film had tremendous acting portraying drama and action at times. The story itself felt a little dull, but the characters for sure make up for it. Another good film."
559,8,The Pink Bureaucracy,"Yep, Umbridge is the worst villain in not only the Wizarding World, but the rest of the world as well. Like Kathy Bates before her, Staunton is so convincing she will be forever associated with this monster. Harry and co are again under siege at Hogwarts, but this time it's on two fronts: the Dark Lord and the Pink Bureaucracy. A slow start turns into a wonderful second half, as it gets...wait for it.....darker again 8/10."
560,8,Order of the Phoenix delivers!!!!!,"I had a bad feeling about OOTP because of its length.2 1/2 hours just seemed too short.But stuff that feeling,this was a darn good movie.There might have been a lot cut out from the book but it was brilliantly adapted into a movie.Acting was fantastic,the best it has ever been,especially that of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge which was the standout.Special effects were again satisfactory as was the set design.A new thing about the movie is it didn't feel like a kids movie anymore.It was much darker and more violent.I still can't get over the fact that Harry,Hermionie and so on looked a lot older than in previous films.This could be a bit of a spoiler but the fight scene at the end of the movie is terrific so readers,look forward to the end.Overall an absolutely terrific piece of work and surpasses Pirates of the Caribbean 3 as my favourite movie of 2007."
561,8,"Of summer 2007's offerings, one of the most satisfying","Let's start with the negatives first. This film is part of a set now that follow on one after another so if you did take it rating as a sole piece of work, my score would probably be lower ...However, to quote Spock in Star Trek VI, ""All things are not equal!"" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was, by all accounts, many people's favourite book was an appalling film made almost unwatchable by Mike Newell's heavy handed direction. The follow-up to Goblet, Phoenix, was by comparison the worst of the Potter books as it seemed to feature a 500 page rant by JK Rowling against Corporal punishment that could have sufficiently been crammed into 200. The challenge for David Yates was to turn this convoluted mess into something vaguely enjoyable."
562,7,The Most Intrinsicate Harry Potter Movie,"And Potter Franchises loses it's magical flair. That flair that moved families to the movies to see a mildly mature spectacle, about flying wizards, magic and harmless fun."
563,10,The coolest one in the series,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth installment in the HP series and this film may be a little bit action-packed, but it works for me."
564,,S.O.S Christopher Colombus!!!!,"If you haven't read *ANY* of the books you will be entertained. If you have seen any of the previous movies you will notice several venue inconsistencies. However, if you have read the book you will walk away feeling very robbed."
565,8,Staunton steals the show,My god what an eye-wateringly intense performance from Imelda Staunton.
566,1,worst expectation,I have been waiting this movie fore more than 1 year (when I read the book) & it's the worst thing anyone could direct starting from this story.
567,2,I was disappointed by this movie,"I was really disappointed by this movie. I understand that the producers, screenplay, director, etc. cannot fit everything from the books into the movies. However, i thought that it was a little ridiculous that the longest book in the series (870 pages) is the shortest movie to date. I also believe that they took out a lot of important things in this movie (For example, what about the whole chapter The Lost Prophecy in the books, that scene was almost taken out of the movie all together-And it was a very important chapter in the book and for the movies, what about st.mungo's? things like harry fighting malfoy? what about giving actual justice to the department of mysteries-explaining the love room, the brains, going back to the time-turners, things like the end scene where Fawkes jumps in front of the killing course for dumbledore?). I know that I have very big expectations for the movies, but I really think that with this movie they really made a great mistake in taking out so much from the books. They are not really explaining much in the movies and I think that this makes the audience confused, those who have not read the books, and also endangers the understanding and completion of the next two books. And just a quick question: Why did they change the screenwriter for just this movie, but have Steve Kloves writing the script for the rest of the movies? It seems that the people behind this movie are always concerned about a budget and such, yet they make more then enough money to make 14 films, not seven. Honestly, I don't think that anyone would complain if the movies were five hours long. I thought that a positive of the film was the acting by, Helen Bonham carter, Gary oldman, and especially Jason Isaacs-those three actors I think do brilliantly in the film. As for Michael gambon, he is a terrible Dumbledore. Two more things, why did they change the appearance of Padfoot (Sirius as the dog) and the dementors? And who the hell is this nigel we introduced in the fourth film, they could have just stuck with the Creevy brothers."
568,8,Very Disappointed But Worth Seeing *Spoilers*,"As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie."
569,10,The King Has No Clothes On,"On another level, this could be the story of America from 2000 on. Evil fascist government takes control in a coup. A major terror event is staged to shock the public and thereby push through all kinds of anti-terror policy which eventually degrades human rights and speech. Everyone is terrified all the time except the few wealthy persons in power. The good guys are made out to be the bad guys. We are primed everyday to fear so eventually nobody dares challenge any policies. Other national governments go right wing as well. Big brother is winning, or should I say big business because I'm sure it is they who holds the strings."
570,7,"Good and evil always exist, but we can choose who to grow up.","The one where sirius leaves, and gradually the people we like leave us one by one. Harry becomes incredibly lonely and weird in this one, but then the power of love and friendship overcomes everything. The order of the Phoenix is a drama in which interpersonal relationships have changed dramatically in eight films, in this film, Potter was questioned by so many people for the first time, even when his classmates at the same college did not want to believe him. He and Hermin, Ron still works side by side, even helping students who don't believe in him or even hate him to learn magic. These have made me see the rapid growth of a 14-year-old boy that is the most profound plot for me. But the shortcomings of the film are also obvious. The plot is too rushed so that a lot of places don't shoot well enough."
571,1,half blood prince stunk,"What was David Yates thinking when he directed Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it didn't even follow the book. He took a perfectly great book and destroyed it. I would have never have recognized the movie if not for the title. They should have stayed with Chris Columbus as director at least he followed the book and didn't add stuff that never happened and cut stuff that did. David Yates should be ashamed of the job he did on this movie, I don't recommend it for anyone who loves the books to go see. I was extremely disappointed in the movie as a story. The only positive thing that can be said for the movie was that the graphics were good. To bad that he has anything to do with the last two. How badly will he destroy them?"
572,8,"Fun, but fell short of expectations","This latest Harry Potter extravaganza fell a little short of my expectations. Why was Harry so mad at the world? Why were the Weasleys in Sirius Black's house? What exactly were David Thewlis, Emma Thompson or Helena Bonham Carter doing in the film? Fortunately for me the movie came out two years after the book so the facts were a bit fuzzy and I didn't care. The movie wowed with excellent special effects, great acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Gary Oldman and the Dumbledore character.. But all along the telling of the tale I was not completely engaged - there was some key ingredient missing. It was almost as if this one was just a filler until the next installment. All in all it was an afternoon well spent to keep me up to date on the story and gave me incentive to buy the next book."
573,6,Disappointing lack of emotional attachment,"I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week."
574,6,Hardcore HP fan says: Okay.,"Some parts were brilliant, I give you that. Luna is amazing. The twins were brilliant."
575,8,Fiona Shaw's Legs,By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.
576,6,Could've been better,This is a good movie but it could've been so much better. The main problem is that it feels incredibly rushed. The book is the longest in the series but the movie is one of the shortest in the series. They cut out every subplot and some of the main plot too and it feels completely butchered but if you watch it on it's own it's okay. It's fun and it also has some really dark moments and the ending is heartbreaking. You will see it for yourself. The actors are great and Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely amazing and he became a great actor in this movie and continued to be great. But the new- comers were also great. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge took my breath away and I don't think they could find actresses who would do those roles more perfect. You will hate Umbridge more than any other character in the series. Same with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She's probably the most insane and psychotic character in the series. One more thing I can praise are the effects. Now it all looks completely believable and action sequences are eye candy and the climax is one of the most thrilling parts of the franchise. The movie was pretty good on it's own. Rushing was the thing that hurt this movie really bad but even if it's the weakest movie in the series it's still worth watching.
577,10,just brilliant,"What to say, one great film! One of my favorite of the year! Being a great fan of the Harry book series myself; was slightly disappointed that some parts were not kept but other than that, fabulous movie! The cast was simply impeccable and were great! Loved the new input of umbridge and the lovely Luna love good .Daniel Radcliffe progressively improves and shows maturity in his acting skills! The special effects were breath taking! Especially kreacher was genius! The end dueling was very stunning! Couldn't ask for better myself! I was very impressed by the entire movie and can't wait to for the next installment! A must see for all fans! Simply brilliant!!!!!two huge thumbs up from me!"
578,8,Daniel Radcliffe front and center,"Another new director to the series, David Yates, takes the helm for this iteration of Potter. Less stylistically flared than it's predecessors, Phoenix is more even in tone. The visual richness of Hogwarts is lacking as all takes a backseat to Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are pushed farther from center stage and the spotlight narrows on Harry Potter. Some of which is worked into the plot and it may be the books work the same, I've only read the first so I can't say. Potter is once again in trouble for using magic outside the school only this time the consequences are more severe and he is expelled from Hogwarts. Overall, I think this may be my favorite of the series, perhaps because it is the least kiddish."
579,7,The Best Potter Movie Yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a difficult job from the beginning; Harry is an emotional and unhappy boy throughout. He is now 15 years old and the hormones are kicking in. Oh, and it doesn't help that Lord Voldemort has returned and is trying to control his mind, all while a teacher from Hell has taken over Defense Against the Dark Arts... along with a few other things. By the end of this year, Harry and his friends have to take matters into their own hands. Fortunately, the Order of the Phoenix, a society bent on destroying Voldemort, is right behind them."
580,7,"Too much, too little.","I have read the book and watched the movie now. And I've come to realize that you cannot compare the two. When I first watched the movie, all I kept thinking was ""They missed that!"" or ""They didn't say that in the book."" Later, when I watched it again I realized that the acting is good and if you look past some of the minor details from the book they chose not to include it's actually a very good movie with ton of suspense. I found the 6th book to be the most suspenseful. It's sorta leading up to ""The Gran Finally"" And they certainly got that effect in the movie."
581,7,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, directed by David Yates, isn't one of the most fan favorite films of the saga! Yates brings in his creative team, instead of using the past creative team, and you can tell because his style is all over this film, for the better! Even though Yates creates his vision of the way things should be, being similar to the plot of the film, he still did a great job of keeping the continuity, and making this film even darker than the films prior. He utilized a lot of the same tones as Prisoner of Azkaban, but he cranked up the darkness, just a touch. The cinematography and color pallet was outstanding, setting the tone beautifully in each scene!"
582,10,"Incredible adaptation, the best yet!","There is no earlier Harry Potter film that can better this. From the beginning to the end the spectacle, suspense and excitement never stops. All the characters are at their best and the new director has given the film a special emotional touch."
583,8,Became my most favourite movie in the series,"I remembered not liking the book. After the action filled book 4, Order of the Phoenix was bland and full of angsty Harry. It was difficult to prog through the book, especially with an antigonist like Umbridge."
584,1,I would have rather eaten crap right from the butt of a goat!,"I am a wholehearted, titillated Harry Potter fan. The first four movies were AWESOME! I have watched them over and over again. I have read all the books more than once. The Harry Potter series is without a doubt hands down the best literary series I have ever read. The movie adaptations of one-four were AMAZING, Great adaptations! All the actors were great as usual!"
585,8,Marvelous,"Firstly I would like to state I have read the entire series (of course excluding Deathly Hallows, which has as of yet not yet been released - 9 days!) several times, and reread Order of the Phoenix before seeing the movie. Secondly I want to say that the score is Phenomenal! Honestly go buy the CD it is well worth the buy. Way to be Hooper. It rival's William's original score and that says quite a lot."
586,8,Expertly thought out and put together,"Unpopular amongst some viewers and readers alike, Order of the Phoenix is the most politically minded film of the series, the most down to earth, and possibly the smartest. Visual effects and wondrous magical spells - while present of course - definitely take a back seat, and the focus is shifted onto the threats of corruption, power, censorship and the media, as it is revealed that the magical government is unfortunately as crooked as our own."
587,8,easily the best Potter film yet.,"I have come to despise the Potter films. They were mediocre up until Goblet of Fire, at which point I realized just how awful they were in comparison to the brilliant books."
588,7,educational ordeals,"I have just seen the movie and I was impressed by the battles between evil and good wizards as well by the effort of the Ministry to control Howgarts School.The portrait of the professor acting as a representative of the Ministry, who tries to impose a tough educational policy on students, using some of them as informers is a truthful representation of reality in any competitive school.The political will to mould education according to certain standards is something which everybody with experience in a learning institution has known.My opinion is that the movie represented truths about life through studies dressed in a supernatural garment but very close to prosaic experience."
589,9,Back To The Basics and how!,"OK, there was a hint of suspicion in the air since some press-critics had been longing for supposedly lost magic, but hey! - the magic was there and what the most: this is again a 'Harry Potter -movie'. 'Goblet' is fine film but as I stated my opinion earlier on it, it lacked the atmosphere that comes through when each movie recollects the events during the whole of Harry's year. 'Till this day 'Azkaban' was on the highest place in my ranking, but 'Feeniks' went just ahead. One reason is that 'Goblet' portrayed not so much Harry's year but what happened around the Tournament and as you might have guessed, I like it when the whole year is shown. Other important reason is how well this time some earlier images, scenes and events were put into use regarding especially movie as an art form. Obviously I must wait the DVD and then firmly decide which one tops the other - 'Feeniks' or 'Azkaban' - but already the series have leaped back to where it belongs: marvelous fantasy-film production of the century and the longing for 'Prince' is ever more aroused. And I guess I have to line up for 'Hollows' Saturday morning so I may read how it ends - first time in English; have been waiting the translations so far."
590,,The Fifth Movie,"To tell you the truth. I was very disappointed with the movie. I entire movie was rushed. There were some cool effects and Voldemort was freakin awesome but I just hate it when they change things in the movie that aren't even in the book. For instance, Neville finding the ""Room of Requirement"". We all now it was Dobby that told Harry about it. I know its small but to a True Harry Potter fan it's like a stab in the back when they do that. I also wish they put more stuff in the Ministry. I wish they added more of the Rooms and all that cool stuff. I love the fifth book and the screenwriter just freaked it all up. I hope that whoever writes the screenplay for the sixth book does it justice. I'm out!!!!!"
591,8,My Least Favourite Book Makes a Pretty Great Movie,"This is actually my least favourite book in the series, and one of only two films that I'd prefer to watch over reading the book (the other being Prisoner of Azkaban). The big thing here is that it manages to condense the 100 pages of Umbridge dishing out rules from the book into a short but sweet montage, and it makes the pacing a whole lot better. Umbridge is a fantastic villain to hold our attention while Voldemort plots away, and Imelda Staunton does a great job. Luna is also a fun addition to the group, and Neville gets some much needed character development (although I wish Ginny had more to do here). Fred and George also add some great comedic moments. This is the first film that David Yates made in the franchise, and he does a good job with the direction. There are some pretty good scenes about how the media controls what people think, such as Seamus arguing with Harry, and the Dumbledore's Army group training scenes are so much fun, and give us more time with the vast array of characters that this franchise has set up. I still don't love the story, and I think it could and should move stuff forward some more surrounding Voldemort, but overall this is another great addition into the franchise."
592,10,One of my favorites in the franchise!,"First of all, let's talk about some of the new cast & crew."
593,3,"Just bad, don't see it","Well that was just a bad movie. Boring, bad computer graphics and a Harry Potter who just does not look like a boy anymore. In fact, I never liked that boy they casted several years ago for the role. His main bonus was that he looked like Harry Potter, but now he clearly does not. His acting is so wooden ie bad. And since I saw his gay bear pictures, I just can't think of him as HP anymore. Even the girl looks too old by now. The red headed guy is just funny to watch, but nowadays he has got rings under his eyes lol, probably too much party going."
594,10,Fantastic.,"Top marks; an excellent film. I'm not sure if I prefer this or Prisoner of Azkaban, but the films are neck-and-neck."
595,9,Best Movie By Far,"****SOME SPOILERS***** I know, I know. They left out St. Mungo's, quidditch, the swamp, and Lily. However, I think this was the best movie by far. They got all the main points of the book, and many of the lines were actually in the book. It wouldn't have killed them to make it 40 minutes longer and add more things, but all in all it was a great book adaptation. Most of the characters weren't too important, which was irksome, but they were in it enough for them to count."
596,9,Enjoyable experience. Definitely worth the view,"Just a risk of spoilage, but I'll try not to just the same. It is true that (as expected, if you're like me and have read the series (time and again)) they could not put the entire book into the movie (lets be honest, thats just not easy to do unless the story is very basic and simple -and while that was true for the first two books, it certainly got depth and complexity after that. However, unlike previous offerings, this one did manage to hang onto the spirit of, and cover, most of the subplots in the Order Of The Phoenix. I was a little disappointed with how they revealed (and captured the participants) the room of requirement and the DA inside, but it still managed to keep the feel and intent of the story. The subplots that lead up to the main thrust of the movie were very quickly covered (and I'm not sure that those who never read the story will understand what happened anyway -but this has been true over the last couple of movies -the movies are clearly for the fans of the story, not the general public who doesn't bother to read it). This new director did a very good job, and I look forward to adding this movie to my list when it hits the shelves. Lastly, the one true measure of the movie was proved out when the audience sat quietly through the movie, laughing from time to time in the right places, but applauding at the end of the show. The patrons OBVIOUSLY felt that their hard-earned money was well spent. What more could you possibly say than that?"
597,8,Best movie of the series so far!,"Having seen OOTP yesterday, I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Sure it has its flaws but overall was pretty good."
598,7,Flight of the Order has its ups and downs,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/2007/***
599,9,Props to the New Screenplay Writer.,I am a die hard fan and was very anxious to see the longest book transferred into the shortest movie.
600,7,A bit rushed in the third act but still great entertainment,"The Harry Potter series has always excelled at compiling the most exquisite array of high-profile English actors any other film has since Robert Altman's Gosford Park. Indeed many of them appear for so little, the full effect of it all can be felt only when viewing the closing credits. Seeing all those names one after the other made me grin. Indeed the actors that get the biggest chance to shine are Gary Oldman, whose character finally comes in full-fledged force and reaches his dramatic and development peak in this installment. Other actors that get similar opportunities but to a lesser extent are Alan Rickman, who has been in the series since the beginning; and newcomer Imelda Staunton. This role is such a polar opposite to the pure good that was her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake; it certainly shows what superb range the woman has. It must also be said that the three stars, in particular Daniel Radcliffe, have grown and evolved immensely as actors: both in Goblet of Fire and now in Order of the Phoenix the three actors show a wonderful emotional range and knack for drama; they have done what most actors aim to do and that is completely embody their characters. Other very talented cast members that appeared so briefly it was quite a pity were Brendan Gleeson, Emma Thompson, and newcomer Helena Bonham Carter  fans of Marla don't fret; she has a substantially larger role in the 6th installment (unless it is cut in the adaptation, which I certainly hope not). But the biggest misfire is definitely Ralph Fiennes. His appearance in Goblet of Fire was nothing short of a novelty; I was blown away by how he (and the director) managed to take a rather poorly crafted character on Rowling's part and make him into something far more frightening than the embodiment of all evil: They made him human. Fiennes absolutely glowed in Goblet of Fire, but his appearance in this installment was so brief he never quite got his chance to shine and equal his dominance in the fourth film. Hopefully much more will be waiting for him in the seventh book/movie, we'll have to wait until then to see."
601,10,"oh my, a summer movie that was worthwhile to see!","now there are, of course, two ways too look at this. One way is by looking at it from the perspective of the die hard Harry Potter fan who has the book memorized and would get all upset over the little things."
602,9,Cool but not perfect !!,That was really a nice part. It was interesting. 9/10 * One of my favorite parts from Harry Potter.<br /><br />1 point deduction because Sirius (The Godfather of Harry) died. Too bad. I was very sad - I didn't like that.
603,6,"Movie was quiet a let down, Plot failures and Bad effects.","I just watched this movie on the first night in theaters, July 11, 07, and this movie was a big let down. Besides absolutely nothing happening throughout this movie, the movie itself seemed dank and dull. The lighting was set at a low apparently as the whole movie seemed kind of colorless. The movie is lacking a LOT of action and has many plot holes that have not been filled. One particular part I cant stand is the fact they introduce the ""Order"", a secret society formed by Dumbledor himself, but after the beginning scene with HORRIBLE GREEN SCREEN EFFECTS you never really see them again. You capture a glimpse at the ending fight scene where ___________ dies. Another is the fact the overall tone and energy of the movie seemed missing. It almost appeared to me like the actors were having a bad day when filming this movie. The movie seemed based on the book and according time lined fairly properly. There appeared to be a ""deleted scene"" or ""blooper"" almost as me and my buddies had pointed out where they show Harry, Hermione, and Ron, laughing away at some little joke on emotions. It turns out its actually supposed to be there... apparently."
604,4,Poor direction and editing spoil #5,"I'm sorry to report Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix movie didn't live up to my expectations largely due to the direction and the editing. It was too clipped and jumped from here to there without sufficient connection. Dolores Umbridge character was perfectly done as was Luna Lovegood, but again the editing was severe. If I hadn't read the book it would have made no sense to me at all. As it is it's a very poor rendition of a really good book. The director and editor should be ashamed of themselves. There were several scenes in the movie that I was looking forward to seeing, but they were very poorly directed and staged. I guess four out of five ain't bad, but in my opinion they should retract this issue and edit it again."
605,9,The 5th film delivers!,This is an awesome movie! The trio of friends is great like usual and very well played! Dolores Umbridge is played very well making you hate her character so much. The third act is emotional and has a great action sequence setting up for bigger plots in the 6th movie
606,5,Funny yet Disappointing,"I could not have been more excited to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I am a die hard Harry Potter fan, and have been waiting about a year for this film. The ads looked awesome, and that just added to the excitement."
607,10,Um,"Luna lovegood is the backbone of the series, an underused and unapriciated character"
608,10,"Great For The Readers, Somewhat Harsh For The Watchers","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, though definitely the best adaptation of the Harry Potter Novels to date, assumes the fans know the book too many times. From the simple act of going to the Hog's Head (which was in Hogsmeade, as I had to tell a friend), to the cut ending dialog between Dumbledore and Harry, there was too many things that were cut that should have been kept. Especially since the longest book became the shortest movie."
609,7,"Impressive, but disappointing...","Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix was and is, the longest book of the series. It appealed to me as the most interesting book of the heptalogy. The character development in this book is superb. Many potter movie buffs will find this disappointing, and to some extent I'll agree with them."
610,10,Amazing,"A new direction for the potter franchise with newcomer to the series David Yates. I wonder why he wasn't involved in all of them, as the previous four films have lacked solidity, direction, pacing, atmosphere and have just been generally disappointing and fairly poor in quality. Yates brings a much needed crunch to the series, with frenetic camera work, tight editing, special effects sequences that finally reflect the magic of the world being portrayed by the books and.....fantastic performances. Yes, I may have criticised Radcliffe in the past but his performance has finally broken out of the dulcet tones of the previous films. His performance matches the new pitch of intensity resonated by this outstanding film."
611,9,"""I Must Not Tell Lies...""","It's phenomenal. David Yates brings ""Order of the Phoenix"" to life with the same dark humor and amazing scope that Alfonso Cuaron used so memorably with ""Prisoner of Azkaban."" He has brought the franchise back on track after a misfired fourth film with a delightful but often creepy mix of fantastic effects, stellar performances, and fresh dialogue."
612,10,My personal favourite,"This is my favourite of the franchise because it gets real. That's it: the characters are all grown up, the plot is serious and a bit dark, it has a lot of emotional content. I love Sirius Black, he's one of my favourite characters and Oldman's performance helps a lot, plus we get to see a bit of Luna, another one of my favourites. I find the ending heartbreaking, but I don't wanna include spoilers; if you've seen the film before reading the reviews, you know what I mean - if you haven't seen it yet, brace yourself."
613,6,New tricks that fail to impress...,"The big three of Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Spider-man 3 and Shrek 3, failed in making effective cinema, but still nonetheless brought in huge profits. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will undoubtedly continue the box office success of the Summer blockbusters, but while it is easily a better film, it still fails to help make a thriving series become good cinema."
614,6,Too slow. Too short. Too dark.,I was very disappointed with this movie. I haven't read the book since it first came out so I'm not exactly sure how much was missing but either way this movie left a lot to be desired.
615,10,Best. Movie. Yet.,"Amazing, amazing, amazing. That is all I can say. It was the best movie of the lot. I find that the Potter movies just keep improving each film. Definitely this and Goblet of fire were the best. The new characters were perfect. Luna, Umbridge, Bellatrix were perfect. Dan, Emma, and Rupert have definitely grown into better actors. Their performance in this movie is superb. Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite book in the series, but I loved this. I was just disappointed with one thing. I was really looking forward to the pensieve scene where Harry views Snape's worst memory. It is one of my favorite scenes in the entire book series. I was highly let down when I watched the scene in the movie. It was too brief and Lily wasn't even there. Also, the scene after Harry and Cho kiss was too odd, I wish they had cut that out. Hermione bursting into laughter made me raise my eyebrows. But other than that, it was EXCELLENT. Fred and George's departure had me cheering. The last scenes in the Department of Mysteries made me cry due to how incredible they were. I'd give it a 10 if they had portrayed the pensieve scene better, but it was the greatest movie I've seen all summer. I congratulate the cast and crew. I laughed, I cried, I truly smiled. You had me clapping at the end."
616,8,"very dark, sad and yet exciting story","Voldemort is back. But even with the backing of Prof. Dumbledore, Harry Potter cannot convince people of the danger."
617,3,Terrible Film,"The length and terrible quality of the fifth book were always going to be huge hurdles for the film makers to overcome. However, the fourth film had succeeded, despite all the cuts, and the Lord of the Rings films had proved that big books can be turned into films successfully, so I was hoping against the odds."
618,1,"Awful book, awful film","Before i begin my rant, i would like to point out that this film was doomed from the start. This is because the book by J.K Rowling, the fifth in the incredibly mediocre series, is by far the worst book of the lot. It is a obese thing, full of pointless drivvle and bland characters."
619,3,"Best of the series, yet still only an average film","The Harry Potter series remains a story in search of a director. This installment is the best yet, incorporating key story elements to move the plot along and new scenes & touches to cram in some character development, but it all leads to an ultimately disappointing climax and denouement."
620,8,"Un-inspiring start, spectacular finish","Like most people who saw the film today, I have read the books, and I know the storyline. To start with the negatives:"
621,10,The best of the series to date!,"While some reviewers point out a few inconsistencies with the book, I think this movie reflects an absolutely outstanding job of synthesizing the whole essence of the 5th book and presenting it in an extremely interesting and riveting way. The visual aspects of this movie are remarkable; the IMAX & 3D presentation was nothing less that superb; the sound and score were excellent; and the bar for acting has certainly been raised from any of the previous movies, especially Daniel Radcliffe's performance."
622,8,A Darker and Mature Chapter in the Series,"The fifth installment of the Harry Potter franchise, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", takes a darker and more mature tone that suits the audience that is also growing up. While it is not the strongest movie in the series, it does offer a strong storyline and character development."
623,8,A Magical Experience,"Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was the longest novel in the entire series but the film adaptation is one of the shortest of all the Harry Potter movies. Harry, Ron and Hermione return once again along with some new characters such as Luna Lovegood, Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange. Each one of these characters is well played with the role of Umbridge being especially good. The direction is fairly decent with the magical world being replicated through extravagant sets. The filmmakers are able to extract the essence of the novel and present it without going for every little detail. This results in a taut, tight movie which is just over 2 hours long. However, the only sin that the movie has is that it feels like an abbreviated version of the novel as a result of which the movie feels extremely rushed and therefore it is not as enjoyable as reading the novel."
624,9,Excitingly newer than that its predecessors,"Funny to tell that I've first reviewed Half-Blood Prince than this one. Order of The Phoenix, as it is generally regarded as the thickest book of J.K. Rowling had much to be shown on scree. I've even thought before it came that probably Goblet of Fire has more twists and story. Equally however Order of the Phoenix simply stood than the latter because of its more enthralling and bewildering revelations. The filmmakers did well honestly with the book. But of course there is this clause that ""Everything in the book aren't entirely visualized in a motion picture"". But this what made the consecutive Harry Potter film solid in the film industry. Order of the Phoenix has to be a fatty revelation. The latter books of course would be considered to be ""fattier"". As a distinguishing but similarly striking quality of the film, Order of the Phoenix possessed this darkish aura which I felt evidently since the Prisoner of Azkaban. The third film was my favorite and seeing this fifth installment gave me new excitement and merited expectations on how J.K. Rowling's remarkable creations materialized on screen. I loved the film's dark air which complemented well how the story progressed. The duel scene at the near end was also spectacular. Since I saw Harry's first encounter with Voldermort, slew a Basilisk, fought Dementors, join the Triwizard tournament and now created an army of his own to fight alongside Dumbledores loyal supporters. Likewise the characters of the film are understandable and the actors playing them are reasonable how they acted their character well. One more thing lovable about the film is you see the characters alongside the actors to grew together. I've felt this evidently since The Godfather. A success to David Yates guiding the accomplishment of this fifth film."
625,8,"Thank you, David Yates, for the best HP film yet!","It was with significant trepidation that I went to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. I'd been somewhat disappointed with Alfonso Cuaron's PoA's film adaptation, and severely disappointed (even angered) by the travesty that was Mike Newell's vision of Hogwarts in GoF. OOTP is my favourite book of the series, and I was worried that the plot, characterization and overall film wouldn't be true to JK Rowling's vision."
626,2,If you loved the book...don't see the movie!!,Unbelievable!! I want my money back. The best thing about this movie was the popcorn! And this is coming from a mom/grandma of a true-blue Harry Potter Fan Family! We have every book...every set of unabridged CDs...every DVD. We have read them all...watched them all...listened to them all while traveling.
627,8,A great adaptation but I expected more,"I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favourite scenes on the screen. For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king""). So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster."
628,5,Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix,I was pretty much excited about this installments as by now I've become a fan of Harry Potter. The movie though didn't stand on my expectations. It has plot holes and things are left unexplained mostly. Rushing the things just offers us to wonder. People are saying that the book is lengthy and therefore they were not able to accommodate things properly in the short duration of movie. Nonetheless its still a good movie and you won't wanna miss it. Well no comments on vfx which is always appealing and a treat. So again its visually good and screenplay is good as well. Yes you will find yourself waiting for the next eventually.
629,5,Wow!! What a let down,I love all of Harry Potter films thus far but I have to say the order of the Phoenix was LOUSY at best. It was very disappointing. Im not saying don't go see it but I wish i had not. 
630,9,Get thee behind me Voldemort,"Of course it isn't the same as the book. If you want that then stay in your room and read the book. Your imaginings are not the same as Freds or Georges or the girl next door. They are yours. So that when a directors view is presented, then, go with the flow. I enjoyed this movie as pure escapism with great characters and wonderful creatures, and yes even the Directors view of how the film should be, given the fact that the film cant be 20 hours long and he cant put in every fullstop and comma. I also viewed the deleted scenes and can only say that it would have been nice if Emmas extra bits had been left in as she was so funny (and I am a great admirer of hers and her illustrious parentage)But apart from that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the part of the story where all the pictures where removed and the halls bleak, so reminiscent of Dickens, to be quite poignant. I would (as many other reviewers have) like to give a Gold Star to Luna who was played so ethereally Evanna. To my mind she played the role perfectly. As far as Mr Gambon well each must make the role his own and I feel that he did, again as someone said earlier we all like at least one of the Bonds. Oh and if Daniel is reading this (as if!) then I wish he would wear his glasses when he appears as himself in public (buy different ones if you feel that you are still in character) as he always has the look of someone who cant see too clearly without them (sort of faraway and distracted{more than ever like Harry than he realises})"
631,9,Movie 5 and book 7!,"I saw the movie is was good but, the book was really large they cut a lot of things, also the movie is the shortest of harry potter, the movie is 2:18 long."
632,4,Neato,"I loved the books when I was a dumb lil baby child, but the movies never really did it for me. They make the Harry Potter world seems so small and uninteresting. The bad guys are real bad, the good guys are always real good. No moral dilemmas here. The duels usually amount to little more than fireworks displays while people yell fake latin. The whole thing is pretty cliche. The music is good, the castle is cool, the cast is likable enough. I don't know. Just seems childish and kinda boring at times. It must be very tough adapting these books, deciding what stays and what gets cut. It is cool watching the story I read all those years ago. It has its moments, and it's kinda comfy."
633,2,Abort!Abort!,"Year 5. As Harry contemplates why he still has not transformed Dudley into a Toad , the brat shows up with His friends and a boy WCKD misplaced. To avoid an oncoming rainstorm they run to a concrete maze with demented results. Nothing a little paetronus can't handle."
634,7,Poor editing takes a good book and crams in too many pieces...,"It must be unbearable to watch this movie without having read the book. There are pieces here and there that are in there without much explanation. If you read the book you know what it is, but you also know that half of those parts were left out only to confuse the viewer. It certainly looked like they had a movie that went on too long and did some bad cuts to get it in on time, only to make things too confusing. This is the 5th movie of 7 and the worst so far. I gave it a 7 because it is entertaining, but jumps around too much. It was like they had to hit a bunch of key points of the book with no flow. I also felt like they had to get stuff in for reference in the next two movies. What can you do. Too much book for the big screen and to many directors and editors crossing multiple movies. Too bad they didn't go the PeterJackson/LOTR route and let one crew do the whole thing. One vision, one story and consistency."
635,4,"Harry Potter And The Generic Plotlined Cauldron, And Dragons Tale Of Overused CGI","""It's not as good as the books"", ""they didn't include half the stuff they should have"", ""it's not how I pictured it, they should have..."" these are all various complaints levelled at this fifth instalment in the Harry Potter franchise and to be honest I tend to ignore these reviews and focus on these wizardry tales purely on the basis of being a film, and not a novel to screen transfer. As a film, how does our wand waving hero compare to his previous outings? Well, not so good. What has dissipated is a sense of mysticism, the fear of the unknown, now it is purely a fear of will Emma Watson be able to give a competent performance before they're all thirty and starring in Harry Potter And The It's Not Over Yet sequel."
636,9,Best adaptation of an HP yet,"I thought Order of the Phoenix was the best adaption of any of the HP books as of yet. It's a big book to tackle, that's for sure. But the writers and director uses tricks such as quick flashbacks and cutaways to condense the book into a mere 2 hours and 20mins. If I wasn't so tired at 2:30am last night I would have wanted more. And still I'd love for a directors cut when the double discs come out at Christmas time. Was it a perfect movie? No, but as an avid reader it was a perfect adaption of one of my favorite books. Again add an hour to it please, it would have been much better. I can't fault OOP though, this was the best installment so far. The angst and darkness of Harry's situation was played perfectly."
637,7,So-called growing up,"I like the feeling of watching it in the cinema.<br /><br />For the content, the lines are worth remembering.<br /><br />I think it is Harry's process of challenging himself and also the process of growing up."
638,6,Disappointed,"New director ruined the movie. That says it all. Yes, the book was way too big to bring it fully to the screen, it lacked action and contained too many intrigues and political nuances. It was hard to screen, but I'm sure, doable. Why not Mr. Columbus? Why not Mr. Cuaron? Why, at least, Mr. Newell, who's dark and depressive, but still whole and logical adaptation of the fourth book was quite watchable? But this, I-don't-know-who director, that has no big experience.."
639,9,Great movie and book,I recently watched this film and really liked it. It's my favourite one so far. 😃
640,5,"From an engaging, exciting book to a vapid movie focused on eye candy","What a disappointment. The execution was so poor. In an attempt to get to bits of action, the movie rushes through almost the entire story. Notice the minimal dialogue? It feels like we jump from scene to scene rather than have a cohesive story. There's no emotional build-up. Instead, we only get emotion from the characters (and the actors at this age aren't at their best). The lack of a soundscape, the lack of a build-up (e.g. The almost dismissive use of Avera Kadavera), and the lack of context make the movie poor. If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't be able to follow the story."
641,9,They finally got one right,"This is my first review on IMDb.com I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, but to be honest I was very disappointed with the first four films. Although they have been true to the story most of the times, they never really caught the atmosphere of the books. The Order of the Phoenix changes that. It is by far the best film in the series and director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have done a great job turning the 800 pages of the book into an entertaining movie."
642,10,"Very different from the other films, but fantastic!!","Firstly lets point out that I am a Harry Potter fan. I am a big fan of the books, and though the films will never be as good, they have done well at capturing JK Rowling's wondrous world on the screen."
643,6,Forgettable and long,The plot is complicated and the villains are not threatening when compared to the wider story. The script also tries to make political points that don't really work in the context of an introverted teenage world.
644,10,"From the Book, to the Movie","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is the Fifth Harry Potter Movie.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is very emotional, where Sirius Black dies, it's makes me want to cry, because Sirius Black is my Favorite Character in Harry Potter. Sirius Black from the Prisoner of Azkaban to the Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />This was the best introduction to the Order of the Phoenix and Bellatrix."
645,10,Why did they kill Harry's God Father,"In the ending between the Order of the Phoneix and the Death Eaters. When Bellatrix killed Siruis Black, and Harry rages on Bellatrix after she killed Siris Black."
646,,Hatefully Pink,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is in the top 3 favorite movies of the series. A new director coming to the table once again brings yet another breath of fresh air to the series. Special effects are no longer below today's standard and yet another original soundtrack from humpty tunes to majestic sequences. Additionally this film introduces a character of which is my absolute favorite... Dolores Umbridge. Her character is captured arguably better than the books and is more hateable than Voldemort himself.
647,1,Harry Potter has run PAST his course,"On Friday night, I went to see the long awaited Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix release 2007 and heaved a strong heartfelt sigh  when it finally ended. I couldn't believe the mess of hodge-podge facts, characters and special affects tossed into two hours wasted sitting in the theater. Boring from the beginning to end, I was sorely tempted to leave prematurely."
648,9,The best Potter by far,"Finally! A Harry Potter film that actually gripped me. There is a tense atmosphere through the entire film and actually a real sense of danger which was missing from the previous installments. The effects are truly excellent and the score by Nicholas Hooper is superb - much much better than the ones made by John Williams, who off course built the scores foundation. I especially like the Irish/Scottish take on the score. My only problem is some of the slapstick scenes - a bit too childish (but then again I'm 33 years old)."
649,10,It's a wonderful,According to me Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best film I have ever seen in the series.Everything's wonderful.It's very frightening and excited.I congratulate everybody in film.I love Harry Potter.It's amazing.This's such a good film.I wanna watch another series Harry Potter.Daniel's a good actor.He's gonna be more successful One day I wanna met Daniel and Emma.They're very harmonious.No comment of this film It's already hilarious.I only wanted say that the film's extraordinary.This film must be watched everybody.Little or big never don't matter.I'm seventh years old.I have been watching Harry Potter for 6 years.I love IMDb because IMDb pave the way for my comment Thank you very much for this comment I love you...
650,7,It's all in the detail...,"I decided to leave it a week or two after seeing Order of the Phoenix to let it level a little in my mind. Mainly because I was really disappointed after coming out the cinema and if I were to have written this review then, I think it would have given the wrong impression!"
651,9,It gets better with each movie.,"I will start with what was great in all the previous movies and that is casting. our old friends did yet again a great job. Oliver & James and their grand departure were simply splendid. Heartbroken Bonnie was so touching. the banter between Rupert and Emma batter then ever. and Daniel - he was simply wonderful. since Harry practically carries this story on his shoulders he was asked to do a lot and he held out, with honors. the adults didn't have as much space as before but were incredible as usual."
652,4,"Best Action, Worst Movie","Yeah, sure there was action, but you cant get past the fact that they skipped so many key points, left in too many unnecessary scenes, and still made it over 2 hours. I would not recommend anyone to see this movie who has any knowledge of Harry Potter and the book, for they will be certainly disappointed. From the first deleted scene in the beginning when they skip the part about Harry being kicked out of the house and his aunt defending him, to the vast amount of information left out of the end, it was, all in all, just not a good movie."
653,,Improved acting from all but about as rushed as it's predecessor...,"I was really apprehensive going to see this as the film before this, Goblet of Fire was a major disappointment. This, while an improvement on the last has some problems in pacing and scenes just don't last that long and feel tacked together with a shot over Hogwarts or something."
654,10,One of the favorite Harry Potter films,"If Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire are the prelude to the climax of the film series, then Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix are the prelude to the climax of the film.Because the real climax is the resurrection of Voldemort. Harry and Voldemort entered the stage of struggle. In the film of the order of the Phoenix, Harry's magic gradually matures. The friendship and courage of the trio and members of the order of the Phoenix excite the audience."
655,8,What to Say,Strong movie to way for Another movie was great and near by perfect and I like it and I had not read and HP books only to Say just Enjoy the movie.
656,7,Have NOT read the books,"OK, so now that is out of the way, this is an excellent movie, and I do not know or care how closely it follows the book, because the film was so entertaining. The focus of this film allowed for significant character development and involvement, which I felt the last two films were lacking, more importantly we get to see a circle of friends truly unite. This film was exciting and full of energy the special effects were certainly entertaining and the dialogue although slow in places was excellent. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson were a joy to watch each showing a little more of their character's true nature. The show stealers where by far Gary Oldman, and Helena Bonham Carter turning in brilliant performances All in all this is still a film you should see in the theatre this tale continues to grow much larger than life."
657,7,"A little less clever, a little more complicated.","Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix"" (2007, PG-13). Directed by David Yates. Written by Michael Goldenberg, based on the novel by J.K. Rowling. Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Katie Leung, Evanna Lynch & Brendan Gleeson. Running Time: 138 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com."
658,5,Left Wanting more,"Im sorry but of the 5 films so far this is the one I like the least. I'm sure a large part of that comes from having read the book before seeing this film something I had not done up until now. The pace of this movie feels to rushed and things that should be in the movie from the book to make the audience better understand what is happening are not there. When you finish watching this film you will feel cheated. It doesn't matter whether you have read the books or not (I have read all seven my wife none). She was left confused in several parts of the movie because they failed to adapt so many key parts from the book. They should have shot for a longer running time and covered more from the book I know you can not shove everything into a film that is in a book, but when you get down it should not feel as if watched the movie on fast forward just to get somewhere on time. 138 minutes is hardly enough time to do the story right. Have they not learned that people will sit for a 3 hour movie if its done right. Even shooting for slightly more than 2 hours would have helped this film."
659,,All about the story world,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 5th book in the most popular work of fiction in history. It shouldn't surprise anyone that this phenomenal success has come in the fantasy genre, but it does. In Hollywood, fantasy is a genre that rarely stands alone; it is usually combined with one or two other forms, like action and science fiction. Also, Americans don't have a long fantasy tradition, which is one reason we think of it primarily as a form for children. But fantasy is much bigger than what Hollywood thinks it is. It is fundamental to the act of fiction. A good fantasy, on its own, has tremendous worldwide appeal, to people of all ages."
660,9,"A must see, but not a must praise.","Harry Potter films traditionally need to have a thumbs up - even if they don't really deserve them. I say this simply because the movies are just chapters in the entirety of the Harry Potter franchise. So far, having seen 5 of the 7 books, one starts to see the light at the end of the tunnel, the actual culmination to the series. I can't say this is my favorite however; the whole movie lacked something. It seemed oddly disjointed and ""fuzzy"". From a book that portrayed Harry as being continuously angry throughout most of it, I didn't get that sense of anger. Sure, there were moments, but at most I felt the biting edge had been dumbed down at points where it almost left you behind emotionally detached (which you only realize when you are suddenly and temporarily drawn back into the world). Most of the problems I have with this film tend to lead back to the movies director, David Yates, who was a curious selection to begin with. He has no real experience, and in my opinion, is apparent in this films visualization."
661,9,Great movie - lived up to the standard set by the book.,9/10 Rating.
662,4,Missing Mike Newell & Chris Columbus,"I loved all the other films, and in particular, the Goblet of Fire. That being said, this movie was terrible. Veteran performers are made to ""overact"", giving this a blown up BBC Drama feel, instead of a Harry Potter film. I'm surprised that Daniel Radcliff didn't hyperventilate when making the film, he had to pant so much in reaction to his misfortune. That, accompanied with the fact that all our favorite characters had no development in this film whatsoever, makes this a very disappointing outing for the series. If the rumors are true that they're going to keep David Yates to direct the next installment, I know that I'll be waiting until after the word of mouth gets around instead of wasting my money seeing another bad film."
663,8,Back on Track,"After five films I have come to realise that it is very difficult to translate these books to the screen. Imagination is far more powerful than CGI,and we all have favourite bits that end up being left out, unless we want to sit through a 15 hour movie that is."
664,8,easily one of the best harry potter films yet!,"well, i just got back from the midnight showing, and overall i was very impressed."
665,7,An activity enjoyed by some.,*SPOILERS WITHIN!* Spoilers for this movie and books 6 and 7! Although I did enjoy this movie I was dismayed at the brutal changes made within the movie that will impact following movies. Not to go into tiny details I wish to draw attention to two points.
666,8,The Potter saga returns to form,"I was very pleasantly surprised by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The book is a tough slog and actually reads very much like a screenplay, so I was curious to see how it would be handled in film form. I have seen the film in both conventional and IMAX 3D versions and found Order of the Phoenix to be the best HP film since Prisoner of Azkaban. This is no paint-by-numbers adaptation like the first two films, nor is it a profound departure from the original text, like Goblet of Fire. Director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg, both of whom are new to the franchise, have simply pared the story to its basic elements and built up from there, to excellent effect. Aiding them in their quest to create a Harry Potter ""movie"" is the phenomenal performance of Imelda Staunton, who exudes the right amount of creepiness as the sickly-sweet-with bitter-aftertaste Dolores Umbridge. I may never want to see pink and kittens in any combination again."
667,9,A fantastic addition to a terrific series,"In the previous film in the Harry Potter series, Goblet of Fire, revered headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) says, ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"". In Order of the Phoenix, they've certainly delivered on his prediction."
668,2,I am so confused!,The movie has nothing we haven't seen before. The visual effects and acting quality are nothing short of poor. It is at times hard to fallow along with the plot. It seems the director tried to use high points of drama and special effects to make up for a poor plot. If Harry Potter is supposed to be a block buster film you think with the large budget it received it could have come up with a decent plot and hire decent actors. I feel that if someone one tells you this film was good their trying to pull an early Halloween trick on you. In all there is nothing special. Just more high points of drama that attempt to cover up a poorly written script.
669,8,"Not the best, but definitely not the worst","As a foreword, I'll say that this is definitely one of my least favorite out of the seven books. No question about it. However, as far as film-making goes, Yates managed to put it in at least a somewhat tolerable light."
670,9,The first Harry Potter movie to stand on its own,"I've always loved the Harry Potter books, but I'd never found the movies more that adequate. I liked them because I wanted so badly to like them. Indeed, with the exception of the Prisoner of Azkaban, I'd say all the movies have so far been rather disappointing (if I'm being perfectly honest with myself)."
671,6,My thoughts as a fan of the book.,I thought they rushed it. I know they can't put everything in but I think they tried to hard to include everything and it ended up being all to quick. They could have cut out a few of the things they did include. I thought they followed the story well even though they did change /alot/. I /hated/ the casting of Mrs. Figg was terrible. All in all quite good. 
672,7,the abridged version.,"Dan Brown once said that if movies were to be too faithful to their material we'd be having 7 - 10 hour feature films. Hardly something that anyone might want to go through in a sitting. But what is the remedy? This is where Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix or perhaps some of the previous films and moreso, other adaptations fall short. While in direction, atmospherics and cinematography it has a lot of moments to boast, the pacing is left uneven and the rhythm of the film would seem rather episodic. Add to that the little slack they cut for those who have not read the book, since I have read Phoenix and even Half-Blood Prince already, I can wink at the same people who have also read them - but the choppy flow of the story is something that is bothersome even to those who understand how the motion picture medium MUST be abridged to have the true 'show don't tell' essence of cinema rather than the comprehensive introspection of a novel."
673,4,The worst film?,"After the Goblet of Fire, I didn't really have high expectations of The Order of the Phoenix, but it being my favourite book of the series thought I would go and see it. What a disappointment. After Moody was so badly cast, i didn't think they could do any worse until I saw their Umbridge, she was not evil enough or simpering enough to be Umbridge. There was entirely no mention of Snape and what he was doing, i think he had one line. How are they going to explain why he kills Dumbledore in the next film? Bearing in mind practically the entirety of the book took place at 12 Grimmauld Place, there was only one scene at the beginning where Harry was there. Nothing was explained in the film, it has turned into one of those films where they assume you've read the book and don't feel the need to explain whats going on. Sirius' death was so quick that I actually didn't care. The film was worse than the Goblet of Fire, i left not remembering what actually happened because the scenes were so disjointed. To top it off was the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort. This was an explosive fight in the book, and I was looking forward to it being transferred to screen, but it was awful. They say the reason they leave so much out is time constrictions? Lord of the Rings was 3.5 hours long, people don't mind long film times, i'd much prefer that than watching a bad film that ruins my expectations."
674,8,"Second best of the series, but didn't feel the magic (A very long and somewhat of a ramblingly detailed review)","I, unlike some of you out there, came into Harry Potter rather late. The first movie I saw was the second one and after that I became obsessive and hurried up and read all four books before the fifth one came out that summer. Upon reading that book, I felt exactly how I did after reading Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers-aka that the book was a gigantic (800+ page) mark time. The book itself, although entertaining and enjoyable, really doesn't do much for the series. In all fairness you can Siriusly (pun incredibly intended) boil down the book to the following points: "
675,7,Entertaining,"It's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie, but director David Yates does a bang up job of it, creating an Order of the Phoenix that's entertaining and action-packed."
676,9,Simply wow.,"As an avid reader of the book series, i was worried about this one. The last 2 movies, while being the best in the series, they left out an alarming amount of detail, which was central to the plot. However the screenplay focuses on the important plots of the book. IE - The breakout of Azkaban, The DA, Umbridge and the Centaurs, Umbridge taking control, Harry's Trial, and the Return of Voldemort."
677,7,"""You will lose everything""","Well, with all due respect to David Yates, I would like to say that The Order of the Phoenix came,tried,and failed.Now don't get me wrong, I am still a faithful follower of Mr.Potter but I expected a lot more from OOTP."
678,9,This and the 3rd one are the best!,I really enjoyed this film. There was a richness in it that the 1st 2nd and 4th really didn't have and it added the magical sense.
679,5,Harry Potter Needs to Cultivate A Bit of Common Sense,Order of the Phoenix: Production and acting: very fine. Music: very good; sound and special effects: superb; and it is easy to enjoy all the well-formed characters.
680,10,The Power of Friendship and Love Revealed,"For the first time, Harry, Hermione, Ron and the others fought together to save Sirius. They also practice the spell of magic together to rebel against Delores and her silly rules"
681,5,...Abra cadaver......,"So many movies today are suffering from 'over-sequelitis' and this latest Harry Potter endeavor is no exception. Sorry if that offends all of you ""Huge Fans of the Book and Why It Does or Doesn't Compare to the Movie"" amateur critics."
682,1,Fails the kid test.....,"Having seen every Potter film theatrically at various times of the day I was always saddled with an audience full of little children. Immediately I was irritated knowing the running about, talking, asking questions etc. that seemed to happen in every Disney, family film I was going to go see. Well what happened was sheer silence and little faces glued to the screen for 2 1/2 hours which is a major achievement and this happened on films 1-4. I took my nieces who are 8 and 10 and love all things harry potter and they were bored wanting to leave. I've loved every Harry Potter film as a movie and thought they were all very good adaptations from the books, except this one. This may end up sounding like a rant but first, whatever happened to having any humor. The books have loads of humor but as each film has progressed any sense of fun or whimsy has been removed. I'm tired of all this oooh its gotta be dark these movies have gotta be dark. Yeah the books get darker but this film was joyless and boring, I saw it 3 times slept twice to try to convince myself it was me. First the film looks like they cut the budget in half, its too dark and i don't mean tone, I mean I couldn't see too much. They did some kind of desaturated film grading that made it look like some cheap sci-fi channel movie of the week knock off. I still think chamber of secrets is the darkest of all the films, with goblet of fire coming in second. Order was one of my favorite books in the series but they managed to make it the worst film, actually the only bad harry potter film. Nothing happens in this movie except *Spoiler alert (Harry has nightmares of voldemort, goes to order of pheonix where there's lots of talking about nothing, goes back to school ends up (still don't remember how) at the ministry, there's a fight, minor character dies very undramatically and its over. End spoiler.) Anyways of all the books this one had the perfect excuse to have a bad ass action sequence, the wizards duel where the adults actually get in the action, but its over before it starts. There is no momentum in this film, things just happen. The sceenplay is the main problem, second is the TV director cuz it plays like a made for TV film. It also seems they used a television director cuz they're used to shooting fast and on a way lower budget. This film felt small in the imax cinemas, All four previous entries felt like massive epics in comparison. This will be the only one I won't own on DVD."
683,9,"Great Movie, Bad Adaptation","Being a Harry Potter fan for almost 10 years now, I've read each book at least 3 times, but this one breaks the record. I've read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at least 6 times. Therefore, I know this book better that any of the others. It always has been my favorite book because Sirius is much bigger than ever before, but that was just foreshadowing to is imminent death at the end of the book. When I walked out of the theater, after seeing the biggest film of the year (for me), and meeting the actors who portrayed the Weasley twins, I was ecstatic. Afterward, though, I felt somewhat flat. This was my favorite movie in the series. However, as an adaptation of the book, I thought it was awful. But, I didn't want a carbon copy of the book. That's what makes the movies exciting. To see what they do with it. I hated the fact that Ron and Hermione were pushed outward, how short Harry cut his hair (Harry wouldn't do that, the scar wouldn't show, but you see it here anyway), and the removal of Quidditch. I know what they wanted to do with this movie, and I liked David ""Montage Man"" Yates as director. I'm glad to see him return. Overall, I think that this is the best entry in the film saga, but falls short as an adaptation of an 870-page-long novel."
684,9,A good movie (though not entirely a book to movie adaptation),"Being a fond reader (and not a ultra-loyalist) of the book, I felt that this movie gave its essence and kudos to the whole team for giving us that."
685,10,An amazing film all around,The new Harry Potter movie was by far the best as of yet. I was amazed. The cinematography was greatacting extraordinaryall around wonderful. 
686,8,Good but not great,"The fifth film continues to be darker, however it doesn't achieve as much as the fourth film. The school takeover is humurous however it does't become great untill the ending scenes in the Ministry."
687,9,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"At 2 hrs and 18 mins. this is actually on the short end of runtimes for 'Potter' films, but delivers plenty of bang for the buck. The Dursleys make a reappearance, the angst from the 4th film continues, and the wizarding world is in plenty of uproar over whether or not Voldemorte is really back. Harry and Dumbledore endure repeated attempts to sully their word as the Ministry for Magic asserts the dark lord has not returned. A special group of wizard, the Order of the Phoenix, knows better and rescues Harry from Privet Drive after a surprise dementor attack. Once at Hogwarts, only a handful of students believe Harry and Dumbledore while the rest openly mock him or keep their distance. Harry meets Luna Lovegood, a classmate who has seen death like him and so can see magnificent flying beasts called Thestrals. But also on the scene is Dolores Umbridge -a Ministry hack under Cornelius Fudge who interferes at Hogwarts and replaces Dumbledore at the school when her strict rules and underlings discover Harry has been teaching other students how to defend themselves against the dark arts. However, Harry has also been plagued by mental contact from Voldemort. Snape has been trying to teach Harry the skill of occulemency to block these invasions but Harry continues to see visions including an attack on Arthur Weasley and a faked attack on Sirius Black to lure Harry and his friends into the Department of Mysteries so he can retrieve an orb of prophecy regarding him and Voldemort. A battle ensues between the children, the Death eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix climaxing with Sirius's death and Dumbledore's reappearance to defend Harry from Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (murderer of Nevelle Longbottom's parents)."
688,8,Had to watch it,"The good thing about the 5th one is that they are at least maintaining the quality of this Potter series. Though the book deserves more. Watching it on IMAX did make a lot of difference. Wish I had watched the earlier ones also on an IMAX. The 1st 2 of the Potter movies had cuteness, humor well spread around the movie. But the last 3 have been getting darker and darker, which is acceptable since they are trying to follow the book. Though those funny one liners and expressions of Ron are completely missing. It was a big disappointment since taking out humor from Ron's character pretty much kills the character, it felt as if he was there just for the sake of being there. I had to wait for 2 hours for the 3D part and will have to wait for the 6th one for Ron's funny stuff. Hope it will be worth waiting."
689,10,A good adaptation of the worst book.,"The director, in my view, had a very good go at adapting this book for the screen, as it is (in my opinion) the worst book. I can't really comment on the plot twists as I knew what was going to happen anyway, but it was very well acted by both the child actors (Luna Lovegood being the standout actor - head and shoulders above the rest) and the adult actors. Umbridge was perfect as the auntie who'd rip your head off and then worry about the blood stain and Helena Bonham Carter was also very good as Lestrange. Some actors let the side down (in my opinion Daniel Radcliffe overacted although everyone else made up for this with their performances). Overall, a very well acted piece and a pretty reasonable adaptation of the source material."
690,4,Disappointed in plot,"I was highly exited to go see this movie and was ready to be in awe. I found it to be excellent in cinematography and the effects were absolutely up to par ,but the story line falls way short of J.K.'s writing, loosing far too much of the plot and jumping from scene to scene leaving someone whom has not read the books wondering what is missing and leaving someone whom has read the book dumbfounded as to why so much of the story has been cut and re-written . I recommend seeing the movie to those whom have not read the book for the effects and to somewhat try and follow the main story line of the movies. As for those whom have read the book, I suggest not having any expectations what so ever, so you will be less dissatisfied. As to the producers, director, actors, and anyone else who may be involved with The Half Blood Prince : Look at the first movie for what to do, and this movie for what not to do."
691,8,"Not accurate to the book, but a great movie","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Daniel Radcliffe, Imelda Staunton) Directed by David Yates Grade: B"
692,1,What a load of old rubbish! The others were much better!,"This film i expected to be better than the rest of the other Harry Potters, but, was an utter disappointment. 2 and a half hours of utter garbage! The story line goes that, oh wait a minute i don't remember the storyline because it was to hard to follow. One minute it was on about Voldemort's return and then the ministry and then this group called the Order Of The Phoniex! The acting in it was great but it was a shame it was terrible film. It contained just one scene of action and that was hardly action. It was like a drama for adults, definitely not a kiddies fantasy adventure film. Overall, what a disappointment. DO NOT GO THIS AT THE CINEMA DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."
693,6,"The film had potential, the child actors went ahead and let the film down though.","This film made a good attempt in bringing the book to the screen. Nevertheless, this film seemed to have it all an outstanding British cast, an excellent location and a great story, but somehow it did not result in the masterpiece for what it should have been. My conclusion is that David Yates was not the right person to direct, I looked on his profile and so far he has only done television work. This explains why a lot of the final scenes were so woody and why the editing was so poor that the film was barely able to flow. I think it was therefore wrong to enter him into the Potter franchise, where he is still a novice when it comes to blockbuster films."
694,,"What can a mediocre director do for Harry Potter? Obviously, nothing","I too have not read any of the books, so I will be judging the movie only on its merits as a film. It felt like a strangely anti-climactic film, in contrast to the story itself that was filled with excitement (one can tell that, even without prior knowledge of the book). The expectations were kept high all along but great disappointment ensued after the most important final scene - like something was missing, or failed to materialize. It was muddled, and somehow the dramatic importance of the events did not sink in at all. On top of that, there were countless secondary incidents and characters introduced here for the first time, while others (older characters) hardly got the attention they deserved - inevitable with such a production where stellar actors like Emma Thompson only get a scene or two at best and mostly serve as decoration. The fault lies entirely with the director. I came away feeling that the movie had no economy, no clear progression, no climax, and no distinct personality (as a film). Far too much time was spent on incidents that could have been compressed for the sake of the film's economy, which also created the impression that the director was trying not to disappoint the readers attempting a far too literal adaptation of the book (at least that's how it felt). I also heard others comment that the final scene was badly edited - to the point that some of the things that happened seemed incomprehensible (in how they came about). By far, the best Harry Potter film was no. 3 and I have no idea why they would let such a brilliant director as Alfonso Cuaron, walk away from the series. What is worst, I saw on IMDb that David Yates is to direct the next Harry Potter film! How that is to be prevented, I have no idea - but certainly it will be unfair for viewers and readers alike to be left with mediocre movies towards the end of the series. The only bright point in the film was the performances: Especially the delicious Imelda Staunton, the wonderful Gary Oldman, and the infallible Alan Rickman. Of course, people will see the movie no matter what anyone says or writes about it (I would), but is it too late to change the director of the next installment?"
695,6,Disappointing...,"First of all, I think it's stupid and unfair to label fans as ""disappointed"" only because the movie isn't 10 hours long and it doesn't match the book word-by-word. I'm a fan of the books and I've enjoyed the movies so far. Goblet of Fire was faithful enough and had good pace and a great finale. For some reason ""Order of the Phoenix"" which is the longest book of the series, has less 20 minutes than GoF and has a lot more content and characters. Too much stuff happens and Harry is probably the only character with more than 5 lines of text. There are a lot of holes in the plot, needless changes from the book (Sirius' scene... why?) and a sense of rush that prevents you from enjoying the best parts. Umbridge was great as well as Luna, but Dumbledore continues to be a completely different character from the book. It's a shame that Michael Gambon didn't even bother to read the books, cause Dumbledore is obviously a key character in the series. It's great to see HP in the screen but if you've read the book you can't help but feel disappointed, especially cause it could've been a much better film with another 20 minutes and less changes from the book."
696,4,Don't waste your time... honestly!,"I really have to say this was a complete waste of my time. The only reason you can even enjoy this movie is if you are a huge dedicated fan of the books and movies, other than that the movie was really bad. It was extremely boring, I imagined there being loads of action like the ones before but there was no suspense or creativity at all! Honestly it was one of the most longest, boring, pieces of crap ever-made. This movie shows that special effects can't save a poorly written script! I do really think Harry Potter has lost his magic. And the the thing that really makes me mad about this one and the fourth one was it tries to make itself a teen movie! I am even a teenager and i didn't find it amusing or intentionally funny at parts! I just feel bad for the director and actors being forced to make more because of the newer book series. Overall if you are not in LOVE with harry potter there is no reason to see this movie..."
697,7,2h18min trailer for the book,"Where is the 99.99% of the book? So rushed, but good. Enjoyed it very much as a child, but after re-reading the book I am a little disappointed."
698,,"Same old, same old.......","Went to see this only because my girlfriend is a MASSIVE Harry Potter fan, and thats the only reason that I would go and see this to be honest."
699,5,Harry Potter a disappointment,"So many things. Where to begin. With the camera work... most of the time the camera was moving so fast..It would have been so much better if you could have focused on the scenes. It was fine in those fight scenes, but elsewhere, it needed a slower hand at the camera. Maybe a tripod, you know that's what they were invented for. And then the thing about Choe..really...talk about killing an opportunity. The Ministry of Magic was a maze to get to the Hall of Prophecy in the book. But no, BAM ! and we are there! in the movie. What a disappointment. Although I must say I thought they did a great job of showing the way Sirius went into the veil. Although, the death curse was not used in the book, he was knocked into the veil by a lesser curse. The young lady playing Luna was great. Good for whomever chose her. Better explanations were needed for many things in this movie. If you hadn't read the book, you would have been totally lost as to why this or that was happening. There are other frustrating things with this movie but I have vented enough for one night."
700,7,"Unfortunately, this bird only just takes flight!","The 5th installment in the Harry Potter saga was long awaited by myself, more-so than any of the other previous films. Partly due to some of the fantastic new characters that were going to be introduced."
701,10,The Best of them All!,"This movie had a crap load of money go into it...and boy is it noticeable! With stunning visual effects, fantastic sets, and even mesmerizing transitions, this movie is truly a work of art! Now, obviously, this movie doesn't involve everything the book does, but hopefully you can look past that and only see this as a great movie (i did). Quidditch is out of the movie, along with many other things from the book that Harry Potter fans should notice, but you should be able to let that go and enjoy the movie and the book as two different things."
702,6,What?!,(Major spoilers!!)
703,10,a spectacular movie,Great visual effects<br /><br />very exciting<br /><br />loved it so much<br /><br />i am a fan of harry potter after this one
704,8,Not quite what I expected but BRILLIANT non the less!!,"After watching Goblet of Fire, I will admit I was disappointed with the execution of the movie. I will further denote, that this is due to reading too hard into the book. I was expecting a play by play word for word and was horribly disenchanted when this turned out to not be the case. Some wise words were passed on to me, ""It is based on the book, its not the book"" With OotP on the way I finished reading the book, but did not fool myself into thinking it is going to play out the way I want it too."
705,10,"Great addition to a Great Series, Nice Adaptation of the Book!","I've read all of the books, a few of them more than once. It's very hard to adapt one of these books to the big screen without making them twice as long as Lord of The Rings. There's so much to cover."
706,9,GRIPPING FILM,"I saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix yesterday and I can say, that Harry Potter is one of the best movie which ever came out. This film has 8 parts and this is one of those, in which a lot has happened. Who hasn't seen the previous parts of this movie, in short, a boy named Harry fights the wizard Voldemort, who by mistake gave a piece of his special powers to Harry when Voldemort was killing his parents. Now Voldemort is trying to kill Harry to regain his powers and to be the most powerful wizard in the world.<br /><br />In this part, as well as in his other parts, Harry and his friends fight with Voldemort again. Voldemort gets into Harry's body more and more and Harry suffers more and more. They created the Order of little kids who wanted to fight with Voldemort, because Voldemort came back and became stronger. One of Voldemort's allies (Bellatrix Lestrange) killed Harry's only family, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, and Harry lost the entire family he had at that moment. But Harry doesn't give up and he wants to continue the fight against with Voldemort. In my opinion, this movie is so enchanting or sometimes scary and also, this film is so gripping There are a lot of effects, which made this film more realistic, and it all creates such an amazing and exciting atmosphere. You can see that the director and the people who worked on the film made sure that everything was good. Everyone who has ever seen Harry has chills on his body, when the soundtrack is playing. Although this film is made up, it is not real, but it has a powerful story that will hold everyone's heart honestly. I recommend this film to everyone. I hope you will like it."
707,7,Back to the good stuff,"I've seen it twice, now, and love it. It's not my favorite, but might be my second-favorite. I'm not sure if it's because I liked this book better than GOF, or the direction, but I enjoyed it more. This one actually felt like the first three, unlike Goblet. Even with the darkness of the film, I loved so much more about it than Goblet. It might be that I just didn't like that story, and this one calls to me much more."
708,8,Amazing film...slightly annoying in parts,"This was definitely an amazing film! Unlike The Goblet Of Fire, it wasn't repetitive with constant moments of peril and narrow escape. Meanwhile, Umbridge was incredible - the way she acted so kind and gentle, yet what she did was actually so evil."
709,10,Phenomenal Film!!,"Absolutely phenomenal film with great philosophical messages, acting, producing, directing, etc. It is a renowned and fantastic film! I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
710,4,Not bad,This film was alright.
711,9,The most interesting out of the five,The most interesting so far.
712,9,"Compelling tale, very refreshing movie","The definitive review is back! Yes folks, here we are again, and once again i have to tell the story in 2 parts. First for the people who have read the book and the people who will just go watch the movie, but never read the book."
713,9,"The best one so far? Maybe, but I loved them all","I saw the new installment of the Harry Potter at the IMAX screen and boy was it awesome!!! The sound, the picture quality and the couple of the scenes in 3D (like the ones where they pick up Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, and the fight at the Ministry of Magic) were super cool. I must say when the 2 hour mark came and the movie soon ended I was quite bummed out- I could have watched 2 more hours and I am sure so would have everyone else in that theatre. I mean, I know they can't put everything from the book in the movie, but if the Lord of the Rings can be 3.5 hours so should Harry Potter- especially for the books that have over 700 pages. That said, I must admit I never read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the size was simply intimidating) and now I regret it because I am sure I would have followed the story even better had I read the book."
714,5,Nah,"This was way too long, the CGI wasn't that good, so many scenes that shouldn't be in the movie in my opinion, and the entire first half had no interesting or fresh and memorable scenes. What I think makes this movie still a watchable one is the chemistry, the interesting themes and the last 35 minutes."
715,8,The film's alright!,"I saw this movie at midnight because I'm a big fan of the books. The fifth installment is also my favourite book from the whole series, by far. This gave me very high expectations for the film, and they were met to a certain extent."
716,8,Least Favourite Harry Potter,"When reviewing Order of the Phoenix it would be unfair not to take into account the fact that the source material is an 800+ page book, and the difficulties this must've presented in selectively cramming the story into a film with little over 2 hour runtime. Many cherished chapters from the book are omitted screen time, but I suppose David Yates does a good job in bringing to life those chapters that have merited inclusion."
717,6,Not fantastic enough to see a second time,"Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix is my second favorite book after the third book (Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban). I don't know; it could be that the movie experience was horrible in the theater. The film had problems starting. We got through the previews, and then there was a 15 minute lag. The last hour of the movie was interrupted with the screen being in half and the roll just dying out. Theater personnel had to fix the film twice. The whole experience left me sour. That being said, the story itself felt very rushed."
718,7,Getting more interesting,As the progression continues further throughout the sequel and sequences as follows. From this point on in the Order of the Phoenix. Things is patching up getting more personal by hitting up between relationship with Harry Potter and the how must not be named Lord Voldemort dealing the last family member his godfather Sirus Black by the hands of his own bloodline Belarice Lestrange.
719,5,"Stripped of all subtlety, alas.","As has been pointed out, this is the shortest movie - made, paradoxically, from the longest book. I'm not sure who's responsible for this, but we can only hope that the DVD version restores the subtlety that Rowling wrote into the story. For example: in the book, as Harry tries to deal with being cut off from Dumbledore, Ron is dealing with a lack of support from Harry. It is a nice parallel plot, one that Rupert Grint would have handled nicely, given a chance to do so. But instead of luxuriating in the human-interest sub-plots, we are rushed through what amounts to an action flick. This is horribly frustrating and a mis-read of this series' viewing public. Surely the producers know that we'll sit through a longer movie (as many of us did with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) if the film is true to the book, yet sustainable as a visual experience."
720,2,Film Failure,Let's just ignore the books. Pretend they don't exist. Let's just pretend that the film was responsible for the creation of Harry Potter and the word of wizardom. It was still by far the worst film of the series thus far.
721,,"A hurried, dark, loveless affair","Despite the hysterical protests of Harry Potter fans who seem willing to accept anything Hollywood dishes out, OotP is such a poor serving it wouldn't give anyone enough soulful nourishment to make even a wispy patronus. As one of the most important books in the series, OotP has to bring the movie audience along with Harry and his friends as they finally start to take a more adult portion of life. Unfortunately most these elements are left out and the three friends' time together seems uncomfortable and disconnected for the first time in the film series. The director's shallow emphasis on 'darkness'' totally misses the point of this film, which is Harry fighting his feelings of isolation, vulnerability and guilt as he begins to access Voldemort's thoughts and feelings. And it is Harry's developing sense of leadership as he takes on the mantle of the number one foe of Voldemort. I first saw the film in IMAX and the 3D sequence was dazzling, but when watching the film on the small screen, one misses the human moments which make up the core of the Potter stories. One also misses the sense of wonder the first films managed to convey. As a fan of the books, some compromise is needed in order to enjoy the films because so much is left out, but this time the journey seems not worth the effort. I'd give this film a 6 out of 10."
722,6,From innocence to darkness - how a lot has changed in 5 movies,"I am not a die-hard Potter fanatic but I do enjoy reading the books (once I have wrestled them from my girlfriend's grasp). But watching this movie, it struck me how much the story has changed since the first one."
723,7,Great movie but,Once again it was a really good movie but so many vital bits of information were left out. These bits of information make certain scences mundane instead of great like they should be. So much time spent on the Harry/Cho scene without fully uncovering what actually happened to their friendship.
724,10,Loved it,"Now all of the Harry Potter films are wonderful and kept many fans wanting more. I found this movie most likely my favorite so far in the series (The third book is my favorite). I felt it was a little bit slow in the beginning and there wasn't much fighting scenes until the end, but all in all, it was very deep. I found the heaviness of this movie made it greater than the others. Of course, they left out things that were in the book, which drives me crazy. But i understand that if they threw everything in, it would turn out to be a twenty hour film, as well with the other four movies. I really enjoyed this one, it was emotional, humorous, exciting, fun, and magical. I like how in this film, the makers interpreted in their own way how Voldemort tried to get to Harry, by trying to possess him in the end, very creative."
725,7,thefilmguru reviews: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Finally the fifth Harry Potter movie is here. The franchise has been through too many ups and downs to count in the public eye. Disagreements galore over which movies are good, which adapts most faithfully and so on. We've had the magical but hollow first two, the darker, stylish and faithful third, the larger, bolder, more adult fourth, and now the fifth."
726,10,The Best Movie I've ever seen!,"I think Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Of course, I love all the films of the saga, but that one is my favorite. Based on the book by J.K Rowling, it is a perfect mixture of action, suspense, adventure and mystery."
727,7,The Disappointment Grows Ever More,"I'm considering the fact that the movies should be graded according to their own structure and not to their loyalty to their novels. And because the directing is fine, visual effects are good, actors are very strong, and the story is still interesting although it's the 5th episode, I think this movie deserves an 8 out of 10."
728,6,Some better than others,"I, like many others, are a huge Harry Potter fan. I read the books over and over again, check mugglenet whenever I can (which is always), see if there are any updates on JK's site, and see the movies first thing I can. I have read many reviews saying they absolutely loved it but I have to disagree. It was a mere disappointment to me. They had the longest book to create into a movie and made it the shortest of them all. They left out a lot and what they did put in they could have added more. I wished they would have put more into Snape's Worse Memory, and not have rushed the beginning."
729,10,A shining example of what Harry Potter movies should be.,"David Yates has created a masterpiece, and leaves me satisfied that the Harry Potter franchise has another great movie. Daniel Radcliffe's acting was so magnificent, as well as Rupert and Emma. People have complained that the movie was too short, I, however, disagree. Sure, it was a bit rushed at some points, and I have read the book, and feel very satisfied with what I have viewed. Even though it may be the shortest movie, It felt a bit longer. I didn't once get up to go to the bathroom, although I really needed too. What really got me, was Imelda Staunton and Evana Lynch's acting. Imelda couldn't have pulled of Umbridges character better. She pulls off the annoying little ""Hem Hem"", and her laughs, and, well, she makes me want to shoot her, in a good way. Evana totally pulled off Luna Lovegood, no one could have done it better. She seemed so warped and wacky, yet calm and relaxed. But, my only problem is that almost a bit too much is cut from the book, and how the story revolved too much about umbridge. But, it dosen't matter, this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and is the best of the series. However, I felt Sirrius's death scene could have been better, and they could describe more about the veil, but the climax was amazing. The movie really sucks you in. And of course, there are those moments for kids, those little jokes put it, I admit to laughing at a few of them, they were actually pretty funny, like how Filch waits outside of the DA, i laughed pretty good. I Definitely recommend this movie, to anyone. However, your viewing experience would be a lot better if you have seen the previous movies, but, most people already have. Put into small words: Watch this movie, Now."
730,10,Magic is in the air,"I cannot remember if I have said this in one of my previous Harry Potter Reviews, but I love the fact that the film makers have remained true to the books. Apart from this I do not know what to say about this film."
731,10,Underrated,"I hate Harry's hair here. But Order of the Phoenix is beautifully shot with emotion, entertaining action and wonderful performances. This entry also delivers two fantastic villains in Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange."
732,10,"Amazing visuals, solid acting, thrilling plot and mind blowing wizard action...a movie fan review...","First of all I'm one of the few who haven't read the books yet, rather an avid fan of the movies. From the very first HP I've been hooked to following an inspiring, adventurous and magical journey of these magical characters."
733,9,An incredibly powerful movie.,"To begin with, this film is visually stunning. This was the best use of special effects and computer graphics I've seen in many years, it also included some very fine cinematography. Not even once was I taken out of the plot by a poorly shot or improperly lit scene. This was the only Harry Potter movie that I can truly say is best viewed on the big screen, from the spectacularly rousing fireworks scene to the truly phantasmagoric battle scene I frequently felt moved to rise in applause for the magnificent visual feast I was experiencing (especially after the recent run of films currently in theaters that leave one with only a sickly sense of empty boredom)."
734,10,v. good but could be better,"i have just watched this film and i thought it was good. but it could have been so much better, it was too short and some of the best bits were unessecarily cut-out."
735,9,Longest book turns out to be the shortest film--and it works!!!!!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the longest book of J.K. Rowling's impressive series, turns out to be the shortest of the moviesand it works ! I first must say 'hats off' to director David Yates, a newcomer to the series, and books, who manages to pull off the best Harry Potter screen adaption yet. Using more of artistic film techniques, he crafts an engrossing film that from the extraordinary opening scene, quietly but swiftly draws you into it's taut pace without missing a beat or letting up until after its' spectacular climax."
736,1,American's Schyzophrenia,"First off, I didn't like the movie. Actually, I left after 1 hour, it was just too long and boring."
737,7,"Better than expected, but only if you've read the book.","In this, the fifth instalment of the series, we find a very different Harry from before. Here, he is beset by insecurity and anger at the fact that he feels people and events are passing him by without his input. Is this normal teen angst or possibly is it Voldermort affecting his thoughts? Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix, a fighting force of wizards against Voldermort, but without much success."
738,8,"Fantastic Film of the Year, yet too time thrifty...","Before I begin my review, please note that my comments may contain spoilers, so watch out; they might spoil the surprise!"
739,6,It's going to be difficult with films 6 & 7,I looked forward to this installment of the HP series as the book was the darkest of the bunch and really the first to set up the ominous future Harry has to meet.
740,9,A Great Improvement!!,"An excellent movie! I think it was definitely a step up from the 3rd one and the fourth one. It contained some scary moment and some hilarious ones too! I don't know if it is just me, but I find that the Danie, Emma, and Rupert have grown immensely I can only hope that the rest of theses movies will be of this caliber! I seriously recommend this movie. However, I'm not sure you will enjoy as much if you haven't read the books. None-the-less,you will enjoy it either way. They did a great job adapting the book, which must've been quite a challenge since the book is 870 pages. It's also a good memory refresher. I went to see it before I reread the 6th book!"
741,,Best of the Series by Far,"I went early in the morning on a weekday to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, in order to avoid big crowds. After I saw it, I kinda wished I could've been in a big crowd, because big crowds usually applaud after movies. I really wanted to applaud after this film, because it was just so incredible."
742,9,The most emotional and action packed HP movie yet,The series just gets better and better. The most emotional and action packed HP movie yet. The character development is astonishing with amazing CGI and acting. Truly a masterpiece of fictional film.
743,10,This is not the book.,"First, I'd like to start by saying that I haven't read the book. I refuse to read any of the books until I have finished seeing all the movies, so that I don't waste time picking apart minor detail inconsistencies. I am judging this movie by its value as a movie, not its accuracy to the book."
744,10,Harry potter and the order of the phoenix,this film is a very good one. And it's going to get darker and darker When each film comes out. this should be the top of the list for the summer. I loved it. And I hope it will be number one from now till the end and beginning of September.The acting was at its best. Of course this film is not suitable for children under 10 years of age. Should be leaning more for young adults and the matured ones. This film falls under a 6 star rating. the special effects were superb and the dark lord Voldemort will be more and more darker when the series continues. Can hardly wait which will be in another few years for us for the final movie to come out. Hope Voldemort meets his timely death
745,8,Why Wouldn't you see this? Do you not like fun?,"he film seems to come from an angle that wishes to allow the viewer unfamiliar with Harry's tribulations through his fifth year at Hogwart's to catch on and enjoy the over-the-top, action riddled film. Simultaneously it is designed to give special winks and nods to the, probably larger, demographic of viewers who are familiar with the novels and are forced to accept that films, inherently, must negate some of the smaller plot lines of the book in order to be successful. "
746,7,Think Lucinda Williams & it's the fifth out of seven...what do you think it means?!,"Ahhh... got to be the only schmuck with a subject line like that for a 'Harry Potter' movie - but think of the intent behind ""Joy"" and you've captured much of the feeling of the audience's reaction walking out of the latest 'Harry Potter.' Though it's madly efficient and quite often exciting, squeezing in 850 pages of text into the shortest Potter yet, less than 140 minutes, this fifth installment is decidedly more dour and grim than the previous installments. A recurring theme of the past films has been the teamwork that has made Harry, Hermoine and Ron such a formidable trio. The later two take a backseat in this story so that the depiction of Harry's melancholic internal struggle can be front and center. Thankfully, the prevalence of the book's most devious and clever creation, the fascist middle-manager Delores Umbridge, has remained intact. Imelda Staunton, her family name quite appropriate for such a niggling squat character. Gosh, how I adored the emittance of her high-pitched squeal - intended to be friendly...instead such an assault. Also, like always, the film makes grand usage of its exemplary all-star British cast - everyone getting an opportunity to interact within the rich Hogwarts universe. Especially noteworthy are watching Branagh's old flames mug it up under heavy makeup. Never dull, the film flies by... but by the end of a special effects laden climactic battle we realize how unimportant this story in the grand scheme. In effect, I felt a bit used, and my urgent desire to want more from Rowling waned."
747,5,Should have known it......,"What shall I say about this movie.. I admit, that the special effects where great. I admit, that the actors did a very good job indeed. But other than that, watching the movie made me really angry. So many things where missing. So many things have been changed, I don't know why? For more drama or sense, or what? I know that it's not possible to adapt a book on screen taking every part of it, but one should stick to the facts and not change basic subjects into something totally different from the book. "
748,9,every film in this saga keeps surprising me!,"I am rewatching this saga for the thousandth time and every time I am surprised that certain details and particoulars come back to my mind. This movie is really engaging, obviously I got even more fond of Sirius Black, Harry's godfather, and his death makes me cry every time: it always seems to me that he has been with us for too little, not even the time to arrive that he's already gone. One of my favorite scenes is the one where everyone manages to evoke their patronus and the room of requirements is full of bright animals. I would watch this film again a thousand times and it would probably continue to impress me deeply. I wish everyone that this film can enter your heart as it did with me."
749,8,Movie Review: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Chris Columbus did the first and the second, Alfonso Cuaron did the third, the forth was done by Mike Newell and the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is by David Yates. Who are these people whose names I've mentioned? They are the directors of course."
750,9,Good for a HP Movie,"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and the Order of the Phoenix is one of my favorite books in the series. So how did the 800 plus book translate to a just over 2 hour movie( the shortest yet). Well it was a hit and miss but good for a Harry Potter movie. Voldemort is back but the Ministry of Magic denies it and make Harry and Dumbledore look like the bad guys so the order of the phoenix is left to fight Voldemort and his death eaters. Now here is were some of the problems start, for fans of the books there are huge plot holes. There is no quidditch, no Marietta, and not much Kreacher. Fred and George's reign of terror at Hogwarts is sadly shortened to a firecracker escape scene. However there are some good things like the battle of the ministry and especially the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Acting wise it was great Luna and Dolores Umbridge were cast perfectly. Overall for a HP movie it was pretty good but fans may not be pleased."
751,8,Good but not great!,"Maybe it's just me but I really feel like there's just nothing original anymore. I saw the movie the first day it came out, really hopeful, fueled by all the good reviews on paper, - especially here in UK where they just love to praise anything they produce, - and I liked it, just not that much. The trailers keep fooling me, making me think that this is it, this is the one that won't disappoint me. Honestly, I don't know what was wrong with this movie, I'm not a professionist to judge right. All I know is what I perceive from a spectator's point of view, and I know that I felt like everything was so predictable; and even when something happened that was unexpected to me (and the rest who have not read the books I guess)I just didn't feel the impact of it. They tried to give a boost to Harry's emotional side in this movie but I'm afraid they failed just short of it. I didn't feel he was connected enough to the relevant characters (I'm trying not to give spoilers here)in order to portray and justify his actions and reactions right. A good movie though I think I prefer the fourth one, but that's just me. Anyway, maybe I'll like it better if I see it a second time. 8 out of 10"
752,9,A great watch!,"Yes, it's a departure from the book. Did they cut out information that should have been in, yes. Now that, that is out of the way. What a Fantastic movie. Having seen the movie three times it is easily my favorite of the movies so far. Which I thought would be impossible since I thought that the Fourth was superb. The actors performances were spot on. Dan had a shaky start but finished nicely. Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna was spot on. The best part of the movie, however, was the score. It evoked all the right emotions at the right times. But a close second was the final battle between the Order of the Pheonix and the Death Eaters. It had me on the edge of my seat every time I saw it. I was blessed to see the movie with good audiences. Go see the movie quickly before it's out of theaters. Cause it's going to be a while before it's out on DVD."
753,9,This movie struggles to distill Rowling's longest book yet.,"This fifth film should please fans who rate the films based on their fidelity to the canonical texts. But for the uninitiated, it's a dry and slightly dreary introduction to the world of Hogwarts and Azkaban, where enchantment and mystery  good and bad  lie beneath a placid surface of English railway platforms, call boxes and pedestrian underpasses. It feels like a placeholder, not because little happens but because so much plot must be served in order to set up subsequent events that there's no room for the gentle human moments that anchor Rowling's heroic fantasy epic to the everyday world."
754,7,Good but definitely Not worth the wait,I haven't read any of the harry potter books but I am well aware of the story so far. The thing that got me interested in this glassy wizard were the movies. First movie I saw was the fourth part and then I saw the rest three. I was so fascinated by the movies that I couldn't wait for the part 5. I then read the summary of book 5 and 6 on the Internet and was so impressed with the story which made me even more eager for the movie 5.
755,3,My problems with this films are as follows:,"1) Comic relief The line, ""I don't want my brother coming out of that bathroom with nothing but his dick in his hands"" from The Godfather, apart from being a seemingly out-of-place humorous line, helps us to identify with the character and underscores the tension of the scene."
756,7,"Fans of the books will be upset at the 300 pages cut out, while making a good stand-alone film for others","I've been reading Harry Potter books for a long time, and this was one I was looking forward to seeing. I expected things to be cut, seeing as the longest book would have to have parts omitted to make a decent-sized movie. Though knowing how people are, they would pay to see a three hour film...such as ""Lord of the Rings"" takes all day it seems. So why not add things? More like keep things in. Personally my favorite out of all of them is the fourth one, but I was still some-what impressed with the quality and how it still remained a fairly good film despite half of the book being cut out. If you've read the book, be prepared to be at least somewhat disappointed with the cuts. But otherwise, you will be entertained and who ever comes with you will like it too."
757,3,"Good special effects, excellent acting, terrible movie","I went into the movie somewhat... hesitant. I am a purist, do the story right or not at all. The first movie was fairly close, but the quality has dropped off dramatically since then. This movie was no exception. As is often said ""The Devil is in the details"", well this movie lost them all. From the opening scene to the closing credits any resemblance this movie bore to the story that spawned it seemed accidental. Many major characters simply vanished, entirely. Other major characters might as well have. Ginny Weasley had three lines. I counted. Harry's righteous anger in the book came off portrayed as childish whining, any scene that should have appeared that might have explained... anything really never materialized, and for all intents and purposes every minor plot line that tied the book together was omitted from the movie that insults it's name."
758,7,From a reader's point pf view...,"Let's put it this way, this movie was very good. However, there's SO much more they could've done with it. I do realize they had to condense such a huge book into a 2 hour movie, but they left out way too much for MY liking. I felt it was more rushed than it should've been. Those who have read the book will know what I mean when they watch the movie. At the end of the movie I was conflicted: How could JK Rowling say this was the best of the Harry Potter movies when they left out such a large amount of significant details from the book? Don't get me wrong I really like this movie, but I was expecting much better."
759,8,It's amazing!,"Harry and Dursley are attacked by Dementor when they were walking an alley. So Harry casts a spell on Dementor. As for the magician of the minority,use of the magic except the self-defense is forbidden. So the ministry of magic is going to withdraw Harry. Voldemort has begun to move. And Harry have begun to move with Order of the phoenix."
760,10,Love it,I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it. I love this whole magic world and I love how perfectly connected the series are. I was a huge fan when I was a child and I'm surely still are - 10/10!!
761,3,read the book instead,"Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Harry is back as a moody and grumpy teenage who is having a crush on his school senior. We all remember Harry as the cute and adorable child whose life changed overnight when he was brought to the Hogwarts, school of wizardy and witchcraft, but in this 5th installation, Harry is not just going through adolescence but is also disturbed by the rise of he-who-must-not-be-named, what the heck, Voldemort."
762,7,I was wrong about movies that cut down on lighting department costs,"Well, Order of the Phoenix - the first complete Harry Potter movie I watched and I am left with the conclusion what the heck had I been doing all these years. In fact, I had watched bits and pieces of Prisoner of Azkaban but I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie because I was horribly lost and didn't understand the basics of who is who just for a simple fact that I hate dimly lit sets and dark night shots. I hated LOTR for that reason, I disliked the Pirates and I was simply uninterested in the Harry Potter movies. Unfortunately, now I realised how wrong I'd been about movies that cut down on lighting department's costs. The meaning of the movie lies deep within it's soul and not how brightly are the sets lit. Dimly lit sets are vital to films with dark themes and HP is one of them."
763,6,OWL - Acceptable,I'm a huge fan of the books and so of course I had to see the movie. But it only rates an Acceptable. **spoilers ahead**
764,10,Excellent,A really nice movie to watch..seeing harry explore new things
765,9,"A fantastic, self-contained side story","The writer of this film is brilliant. He managed to turn what was a major problem for the story into an advantage FOR the film. The problem? Well, the bad guys (Death Eaters) are finally back to their full power and ready to strike. Therefore, there is only one logical thing for them to do at this point, which is go after Harry. But that clearly can't be the story told until the final film. How do they fix this? How do they tell another complete story without the forces of Voldemort as the villains?"
766,10,WOW! Number Five Lives up to the hype!,"This movie was excellent!! The story was great and it related to the book amazingly! The acting was great, Daniel Radcliffe and the rest have really grown into remarkable actors. OK, a few scenes were left out, like McGonagall being stunned and Harry trashing Dumbeldores office and Ron on the Quidditch team, but you can't exactly put all 870 pages into a non boring movie. Non-readers of the book would never want to sit for that long. I must say I love the books and the movies and this one was remarkable. The action and special effects were great! So, I must say even if you are not a Potter fan, go see this movie if you want to get lost in an incredible, breathtaking, and well acted movie!"
767,9,in my top 3 HP movies,"This is the most over-hated HP movie in my opinion. i agree that it leaves a lot out from the book, but so do some of the other movies. i especially loved the ministry of magic scenes towards the end, it's the best part. i love the introduction of luna, the sirius scenes, and the more thorough character development for the golden trio, which we definitely didn't really see in the goblet of fire."
768,9,Great.,This movie is great. One of my favorites from the franchise
769,10,Oh My God!,"Well, i totally agree with the review. It was amazing! The characters were exactly how i imagined them. The film was brilliant. I am now waiting for the book. My only problem with a character in the film was Grawp, but... this tiny flaw can be overlooked, (Hehe). What a line by Sirius, ""Don't touch my Godson"". And what about the duels at the end with the order of the Phoenix, now you have to admit that that was total and utter class. The way they fought each other was great. And what about the HArry and Sirius, vs Malfor and Nott duel. Unbelievable. I also thought that Tonks was brilliant, she was exactly hoe i imagined her. Yeah, it may not be exactly like the book, but it is as close as it can be."
770,9,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Rating,Technical Aspects: 10%<br /><br />Sounds and Music: 9/10<br /><br />Camera and Visuals: 9/10<br /><br />Scenes and Costumes: 8/10
771,10,Straight to the Depth,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the most emotional and the most relatable movie I've ever watched in my life. This is the moment where the magic connects with our real world and presents all the similarities. David Yates changed the Harry Potter franchise in a good way by making it way more serious and removing the childish elements. That is exactly what this franchise needed, since the books did exactly the same thing by becoming more and more serious after each new part. In this movie our main protagonist Harry starts suffering with his mental health and emotions, caused by all the strange things that happened to him since the beginning. All those emotions and feelings are so good presented by the director and the writer that it makes us totally relate and basically feel exactly the same as Harry himself. That is why this movie touched my heart and made me fall in love with this movie franchise. Further, it's also an amazing Picture and I'm amazed by the cinematography and the new original ideas from David Yates."
772,10,good,"1. Eager to be taken seriously, the whole world knows Harry Potter is a big shot."
773,2,Harry Potter and the worst movie ever!.,"I'm sorry, but this movie reeked of poor craftsmen ship from the start. I went in to this believing a darker take would bring new material or possibilities to the forefront, but all I kept thinking was why is nothing happening. Constant repetition of irrelevant plot points driving home that they are at a school of magic. Nothing new was created or expounded upon. I just kept thinking is something interesting going to happen. Then I remembered that the author was a hack and basically ripped off things from Tolkien, so I didn't feel so bad. I remembered that she cranked out books for profit and not artistic merit or value. The filmmakers created their own mess with erratic cutting and jumpy plot shifts. Then I checked the no-name director with unheard of credits and realized again this is all of money and the masses are ignorant enough to feed the beast. Harry Potter is the easily digestible knock off hack bus. Everyone that gets on knows no better because they are either below the age of 12 or completely uncultured and without pedigree. I found this movie completely boring and I went into believing it would be entertaining. Boy, was I wrong. What garbage."
774,8,fantastic,"This is my favorite series of Harry Potter. In short, this series is the adventure of Harry Potter, who is the main character of this series, with the scar on his forehead. He and his friends have an adventure using the magic. In this movie, they have a battle with his rival, Lord Voldemort. However, in the battle, one of Harry's fellow, Sirius Black is killed. Harry's name is given by him, so he is like a father. Harry has very strong courage. He challenges a lot of difficulties boldly. Of course, I like the story, but I like the effect in each scene more than that. In battle scene, the CG is used to express the magic. That is very real and has much impact. That attracts me into the screen, so because of it I can enjoy the story and visual fully. Not only this movie, but also other movies are very interesting, so you should watch it."
775,,Not So Magical Marionettes,"Wow, what a disappointment. The Potter series is on its way south. Here it continues to devolve into that dreaded practice of film-making-by-committee. So much art is an inherent threat to success, especially in film stories regarded as Big Money ""properties"" that must be engineered for mass appeal, thus we see very little artfulness in such movies. And when it does show up you figure it had to be sneaked in somewhere. Because the creation of these projects involves so many different perspectives from multiple creative departments it's that much more difficult for the director to enforce an overall vision. When we see things in the picture that we like then it is usually something self-contained that doesn't integrate into our movie experience as a whole. All of which is true of this. It has the expected assortment of qualities we admire -- individual scenes lifted from the book, the performances, the preservation of Rowling's politics, stylistic touches -- but it's all detached. Fragmented."
776,4,"Read the book, then watch the movie",Contains spoilers. You've been warned - BEWARE! 
777,9,Grest adaptation but...,"Spoiler alert I am a great fan of the series I already read all the book and I agree this is one of the best movies in the series maybe even better than the 3rd. Which is a relief for the 4th was a disaster in my opinion I mean they were the bloody school champions and they portrayed them as fools. I seems the characters actually went to acting classes for this one. I have some complains though the movie did not capture the end of the book I mean Harry was downright furious at Sirius death to say the least he was trashing Dumbledore's office and was on the verge on going after Dumbledore too not seating weeping at his lost. The prophecy was changed and Neville's possible involvement. Another miss the mirror from Sirius is missing and that is important for the last book. I also regret the lost of the comedy part I recall an scene where Draco is trying to corner Harry and he just replies something like Sure the Death eaters and Voldemort were just warm up practice for you. Though I loved the girl playing Luna she seemed to be missing her odd artifacts that made her bizarre in the book I do no know odd glasses, strange pendants. However I highly recommend this picture."
778,6,"Good film at best, but strays from the pack","When the first film came out I was awed, like many others, at the amazing fantasy world that is Harry Potter. I soon after began reading the series' books with much enjoyment. I have approached each movie with excitement and an understanding that it is often impossible to portray every detail from such long and complex literary works as these. As such I find myself torn with this fifth installment of the on-screen Harry Potter series. I want to love this film but I cannot overlook its very obvious flaws."
779,8,"A good film, just don't read the book first!!","Separate the book from the film, and this is a good movie as Harry Potter films go. I do have a few complaints (as expected as I read the book first) it moves way too fast, how on earth the non-readers keep up and have the slightest idea whats going on, I have no idea."
780,9,Excellent Fast Paced Film,Queued up like many more to watch the first showing today of the film at 11am and I'm pleased I did.
781,6,"Entertaining, But Mostly Forgettable (and Poor 3D Sequence)","This is one of the better Harry Potter films, but as with all of them (and particularly with the length and detail of book 5), a lot gets left out. Overall, this film was entertaining, but mostly forgettable."
782,7,Worst movie of the series,"After seeing this film I am left wondering, who is this director? and why does he want to ruin the Harry Potter series? But it's not all his fault, the screenwriter has left out so much of the feel of the previous movies. The movie felt too short and didn't have enough of the ""wizarding world"" and it's atmosphere. The movie felt hollow because other than Harry himself, the other characters had little involvement and no character development besides their obvious age difference from the last movie. Important scenes were paced too fast and lost the intended impact. Special effects were good, but borrowed heavily from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I just hope this director does a better job of the next movie or the producers see the light and get a better screenwriter and director combination. Thumbsdown from me"
783,9,Evil must be confronted.,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth instalment of our boy wizards adventures and this time, it's getting even more dark. Yes Harry is back again with his magic world right behind him, well actually that really isn't the case here. With the events that took place in the preceding film, Harry is up against seemingly everyone in this movie, and the angst of some of these teenagers is sky high too. The movie is awesome. It's the kind of movie that after 10 times of watching it never gets boring."
784,9,Good novel,"Good novel, grand world, rich setting, wild imagination, but not perfect, many flaws, its success depends more on the huge success of the film adaptation."
785,9,Most importantly,"Most importantly, in JK Rowling's world, magic is a power that is ubiquitous and has almost no threshold for wizards, but she doesn't explain exactly what magic is."
786,8,"Well, I hate to say it, but this is the wost Potter flick so far","It's here! It's here! With the long awaited book #7 on the verge of release, Harry Potter mania is at frenzy level and this has transferred over to the newest movie, which is based on book #5. It may be the adolescent girl in me, but I am a Potter fan. I have read all the books (okay, okay, yes, more than once) and book 5 is my favorite so far, so my expectations may have been a tad high going into this one, but this is the worst Potter movie effort thus far. Although, still an enjoyable film, the editor's knife was a little sharp here. Although, it is already just over two hours, this is the longest Potter book and has been made into the shortest Potter movie. The result is short, almost choppy scenes that seem more suited to the trailer than the main feature. If Yates had put in another half hour or so, this effect may have been eliminated. The story is good, however, and the young cast is improving. The effects are good but also missing are the slow tacking shots that gave Hogwarts much of its wonder."
787,6,Longest Book and yet Shortest Film.,Too many important plot points deleted. The characterisation for some of the characters are majorly off too. This is my second least favourite movie of the series.
788,7,Great Movie worth watching,"I read another review before this and this person seems to have watched a totally different movie, his Harry potter was 3 hrs long.....""What The?"". I will have to disagree with many people and say that the director failed slightly to capture the book, changing many crucial scenes, especially the ending which left me extremely disappointed. I am not saying that this is not a great movie, I just wish I had not read the book, which was much more intense, terrifying, thrilling and crushing. The effects are great and the acting wonderful although I would have thought that more time would have been spent developing the characters. It is a great movie and the ending although different was well executed and left me wanting to see more. Having been a fan of this movie franchise and also the books it is great to see the development of the actors. It would have been nice if the writers of the screenplay had taken a little more time as i felt it was missing too many crucial moments and at times during the movie It really does seem rushed. If the writers and director had put a little more thought into this movie it could have been a classic, but alas you cant have everything."
789,10,The best Harry Potter flick by far,"If you are an avid Harry Potter reader, then you'll definitely love the movie. Adherence to the book was satisfied to a good extent although some characters were omitted(as usual).Even little elements like the thestrals flying over the forest was covered promptly.This movie wasn't dark as the previous two but significantly, it was silent and more thoughtful.The performance by Imelda Staunton(Dolores Umbridge in the movie) is unbeatable. Kudos to her for the sheer villainy portrayed by her character (or rather she lived her character in the movie).The movie however lacked the little funny element of the book.Dumbledore's Army and the sessions where Harry teaches his friends is very good. Evanna Lynch suited Luna Lovegood to a tee.The scenes of the wizard duels in the climax were really wonderful treat for the eyes.Michael Gambon's (Dumbledore) part can be well described by the following words of one of the characters,Kingsley Shacklebolt(Played by George Harris)-""He's got style!"". And the favorite trio of the series grow closer with this movie.Ron (Rupert Grint) however could've been used more effectively. No quidditch scenes in this movie and so he missed his chance to impress the audience. Sirius Black's (Gary Oldman) part was very serious and was totally justified.Hats off to Gary Oldman.His house elf Kreacher,however had no role at all,with only two instances of appearing on screen.Coming to Harry's First kiss - well.. no comments about that.The Ministry of Magic was a delightful set indeed and the climax was well planned and executed.The final meeting between Harry and Dumbledore could've been a little longer and more interesting.It would've seriously made a difference.And the background music was totally insufficient.It was silent for most of the movie."
790,9,best so far,"this is definitely the best potter film so far. the first film was childish, however i did enjoy it because it came out when i was 12, but i feel the films have grown up with me, now i'm 18 and OOTP has just the right ingredients to appeal to my kind of audience - girlfriends, emotional turmoil, anger etc."
791,5,Lacking,"I have not read the book and thought that might be why I felt lost by the film. After having spoken with others, I think I might have been even more disappointed in the movie if I had read the book."
792,,The order of the phoenix,"From this movie, the battle of Harry and Voldemort becomes serious gradually. In the previous movie of Harry Potter series, the goblet of fire, Harry meets Voldemort and tell it to everyone. However, the most of them don't believe it. So, Harry feels alone, but the friends like Ron and Hermione believe him. And, they try to make Dumbledore's Army like the order the phoenix to fight against Voldemort and Death Eaters who are minions of Voldemort. And there they and a lot of members practice the magic. They go to the department of mysteries to find Sirius captured by Voldemort, but it is fake and trap of Death Eaters. Then, the order of phoenix comes to help them and they fights against Death Eaters. Finally, Harry fights against Voldemort with Dumbledore, and Voldemort escapes. This movie's images are very exciting and powerful."
793,8,Pretty good,"A well done film with such beautiful cinematography, it hurt. Stawomir Idziak has really outdone himself, making each frame, each transition, such a pleasure to watch."
794,7,Entertaining but fails the book,"I just went to watch the latest Harry Potter installment with my son. To start with the end (in more than one sense) my son was almost fuming at it. Having read the whole thing a few (several?) times he was very mindful of all the things that changed from the book, but the ending is what upset him the most and from then I started thinking on the whole ordeal. Saying that a movie wasn't faithful to a book is normally stating the obvious and in this case while the main events from the book are there a good part of the spirit of the book died at the hands of the script writer and the director. Don't get me wrong I don't think the movie was a disaster (like that pathetic attempt of a movie called Eragon) but all the teen angst that overflows the 5th book is almost completely absent; is like the anger of a 15 y/o had been shrunk to a 9 y/o's size, and to complete the coup the very last scene is so cheesy that seems copied from a 80's TV series. The book is dark and the movie barely tries, which is perhaps what upset my son so much more than the scissors that made the 2'18"" movie possible."
795,8,A flawed yet still superb performance.,"My chief complaint about this film was that certain key (comical) scenes that I anticipated for months were disappointingly not there. Am I the only one who was looking forward to seeing the DA give Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle what for when they attacked Harry on the Hogwarts train at year end? Or the swamp created in the Great Hall by the Weasley twins? Granted the movie was meant to be dark and somber, but a little humor never hurts, especially when it is so delightfully described in JK Rowling's prose."
796,,The best movie of series,"Before I watched this movie, I especially liked Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but when I saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I realized that it is the best movie adaption of the series, certainly! Yes, I agree that many elements from the book are not shown in the film, but still, the filmmakers have been able to make this a wonderful movie. I liked this movie very much, firstly because of it's wonderful musical effects, and secondly because of the adaption, and thirdly, because of the casting. You know, casting is an important element of a film. If the cast is good, then the film is good, and if the cast is bad, then the film is bad! Daniel, Emma and Rupert give, as general, excellent performances, as do Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Bonnie Wright and others. I would also like to praise the new actors and actresses of the series, for example, Evanna Lynch, Helena Bonham Carter and others."
797,6,A movie that feels rushed and ends up disappointing,"The whole problem with this film is the length of the book it is based upon. Trying to cram over 700 pages into two hours ends up being very frustrating to those who love the book. While the writer of the screenplay manages to hit all the highlights, he leaves much out. The director makes some unfortunate choices as well, too many swooping soaring camera shots, and a final battle that is very rushed, and hard to follow since he chooses to use special effects with people disappearing into a swirl of light/sand regularly. This does not match the description of J. K. Rowling and ends up just being a confusing mess, rather then a climatic moment. Had the director paced the final scene better it might have worked. The character development is uneven. Harry is developed fully, and we truly sympathize with his teen angst, and anger at the world, although the latter could have been developed better at the beginning. Minor characters such as Neville, and Luna are fully developed, and Neville really grows up nicely in this film, but Ron, a major character, is nothing more then a bystander in this film, and is given virtually nothing to do, this may be because Grint is the worst of the kid actors. Hermione gets a few shining moments, but is again reduced to the role of bystander, which she is anything but in the book. Watson remains the best actor of the kids, although Radcliffe is slowly growing into a very good actor in his own right. The majority of the rest of the regular cast have one or two scenes each, and that is it, making almost no use of a very talented group of actors and actresses. The result is the weakest film in the series so far, and it is very disappointing indeed."
798,8,When everything is against you,"This movie in the harry potter series in the best since the first one. They make all the drama and feelings real, and show the struggle of what the society/your enviorment wants you to be dont always matches up with what you want. This movies shows how you cant always give in and instead fight for what you believe."
799,10,So disappointed - HPOTP Review,"Okay, so I rarely write reviews for films on IMDb, but Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix really disappointed me. There are just so many flaws and so many things that should've been changed before the movie was actually shown in theaters worldwide. But before I start, I had excellent expectations on the 5th movie of the series. People said this was the ""best Harry Potter yet"", the one with the best performances by the ensemble cast. So I was really happy when I read all these great reviews. But I started worrying when A) the soundtrack was getting horrible criticism (and, in my opinion, the soundtrack is one of the most important parts of a movie) B) I read that the movie was 2 hours and 18 minutes long. I started thinking that maybe IMDb made a typo. Did it perhaps mean 3 hours and 18 minutes? I just forgot about the fact and went into the theater happy that I was about to see...""the best Harry Potter yet"". Oh boy, how wrong was I. The movie started out with just the first 20 something notes to ""Hedwig's Theme"", the WB logo, and then the title logo. Okay, every movie has always begun like that. But then...everything was like a blur. The movie was just going so fast, at times I was afraid of blinking, thus losing a key scene of the film. So firstly, I'd say that the fact that this was the shortest movie made out of the longest HP book is a PROBLEM. Secondly, the actors. I mean: there is no character development in the movie. It's just one action after another. Hermione has always that stern, worried face. Ron has always a demented face. Harry is continuously mad. Seriously! Calm down people. This is a typical HP-movie dialogue. Hermione: ""Harry you don't get it! You don't get it! You are in danger Harry! You must be careful! Bla BLA BLA"" Harry: ""Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!"" (starts having convulsions) Ron: Incomprehensible boring babble. The movie completely loses the ambiance and the atmosphere that Rowling has so often emphasized in her books. Similarly, Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, and Steven Kloves excelled in re-creating the magical world on screen. Mike Newell did an okay job. Yates did a terrible job. If it wasn't for the fact that just about the entire production crew has remained the same in years, Yates probably would not be directing HBP. It follows that it is probably Goldenberg's fault that so many interesting sub-plots have been lost in favor of a rapid, fast-forward creation. Special effects somewhat save the day. Together with Stuart Craig's production design - which, by the way, is so similar to what I had imagined. I guess we could say that, had it not been for him, the director would have had a rough time playing around with the camera and trying to recreate the same, suspenseful conclusion that Rowling had thought of (i.e. the prophecy room, the ending scene in the ministry). Also, great actors such as Bonham Carter, and Staunton, as well as the stellar cast, save the day (apart from the main three). Thanks to them, the movie has a reason to exist. And finally, what really did NOT save the day was the music. Nicholas Hooper should be fired right NOW after what he has written for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It all sounds so empty, so badly orchestrated, so...NOTHING. Hooper's score resembles an unoriginal trailer/production music rather than a proper HARRY POTTER score. You know, Patrick Doyle had nonetheless tried to emulate Williams thus producing an exceptional score, which could've somewhat applied to an HP movie. But Hooper. Seriously. Everything's just a mess. How could the guys at WB even let him SCORE the next film! Are they nuts!? Whether it is the movie that just seems so rushed. Whether it is the director that seems to constantly use the same camera movements (i.e. the camera passing through glass) Whether it is the WAY-TOO-LONG kiss between Cho and Harry which felt embarrassing rather than romantic. Whether it is the dreadful score. Whether it is the incompetent screenwriter. Whether it is this thing or that thing, the movie entertains, but fails to deliver what Rowling had in mind. I'll buy it on DVD and keep it in my Harry Potter collection, hoping that some day, I'll have better opinions of it. But do not expect me to clap and cheer for Yates. I'm seriously thinking of creating a petition so that he does NOT return for the Half-Blood Prince. Watch it if you're going to go inside the theater with low expectations. Do not watch it if you hope to see the ""BEST HARRY POTTER YET"". Watch it if you want brainless fun, if you want a movie with suspense, comedy, drama, horror?, fantasy, etc. Do not watch it if you want a slightly more serious film, a better recreation of the Harry Potter world on the silver screen. A rushed-through film that should have been saved from the hands of the editors. What a let down. A fun let down. But still a let down."
800,8,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!","I've just finished watching all 5 of the HP movies back-to-back.....with my husband, who has not read the books."
801,8,Good Movie...But Not as good as book,First off let me say that I love HP and I was hoping the movie would be like the book.
802,9,A little different from the book...but still very good,"Okay I'll admit that bookwise, my favorite is The Half-Blood Prince. But seeing as how that one has yet to be made into a movie, I'll talk about The Order of the Phoenix. I just went and saw the movie today (and I hope to see it in Imax sometime). Micheal Gambon actually made a very good come back as Dumbledore unlike in Goblet of Fire. Granted quite a few scenes were cut from the film, they still did a very good job at keeping the story together, so even if you haven't read the books (which no one in my family has except me), you still can understand it. Rupert Grint as always was excellent as Ron, although he could show a little more emotion. Emma Watson topped it off as Hermione being annoying as she sometimes is. And of course Daniel Radcliffe as Harry also gave a good performance. Sometimes the look on his was a little creepy as well as intriguing. I also liked Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, despite him having a relatively small part in the story."
803,9,"Outstanding, fantastic acting and full of excitement!","I was really excited to go seeing this movie, because I've always loved the Harry Potter books/movies and I'm a huge fan of Emma Watson (Hermione Granger). So today was the day. Already in the beginning, the movie is exciting, when Harry en Dudley get attacked by Dementors. And the excitement doesn't stop there: the whole movie is full of exciting moments, flashes, lines and whatever more can be exciting. I'd almost say that the most beautiful thing of this movie is the outstanding acting of everyone. With every movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson grow (not only literally, but also in their acting) and I'm not surprised about the great reviews of Order of the Phoenix. Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) is obviously fantastic: his way of talking/doing things is almost moving, and the feeling between him and Daniel Radcliffe is really special, as if they are really godfather and -son. With his movie comes a new character named Luna Lovegood, portrayed by the lovely fourteen year-old Evanna Lynch, whom got casted for this part out of 20.000 other girls. Her remarkable appearance, her high, soft voice and her dreamy eyes make her exactly the right person to play the part of Luna. She's pretty much like I thought Luna would be like, and she's really doing very well. And then we have Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore). Thinking he wasn't the right person for this part (too restless, much more different than Richard Harris was, he was always more like I had Dumbledore in mind), I sort of changed my mind today. He's an outstanding actor and has a very remarkable, beautiful voice. Daniel Radcliffe is doing a very good job as Harry for the fifth time. I hope those who've seen Equus in London, the piece in which he's naked, will be able to get that picture out of they're head for a moment and enjoy watching Daniel as Harry Potter, and not as the sort of mental Alan. Emma, my lovely favorite actress, is once more outstanding as Hermione. She really seems to UNDERSTAND this character, she's thought about it, and that's the right thing to do when it comes to acting: make sure you understand the character you're playing. So does Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, though a pretty small part, played very well. David Yates prooves that he's a good director, and I am really happy that he'll be doing the next HP movie too. Overall, this movie is great, though it was a pity they cut out a lot of things that are in the book. The kiss of Harry and Cho is sweet and kind and romantic, I loved it. The movie is one big story full of excitement, wonderful music and outstanding acting. I recommend it certainly."
804,9,"Not the book, but one of the best","While the book is still one of the best in the series and the movie isn't as good as the book, it is without a doubt one of the best in the series. It takes you through the story giving you the most important parts of the book."
805,7,"Better than 3&4, but not 1&2","What's good about it: It's not as long as every other one and they also wear there robes unlike 3 and 4. It is darker (like the book) then any of the original movies and you can tell that in the first 5 minutes. Ron, Fred and George still have some funny lines, but mainly Fred and George. Also they used flashbacks from the other movies."
806,2,Sad,"We have been waiting so long for this Movie, We bought advanced tickets for the 7p.m. show, then my daughter found out her softball game was canceled and we had to rush and get the 12:01 tickets. We could have waited, along time maybe till Video, this was the biggest disappointment."
807,9,"great movie, closer in spirit to the books","The fifth installment in the Harry Potter movies is a satisfying retelling of it's book counterpart. What most impressed me was just how much the cast has grown as actors. All of the main characters have improved dramatically and the newcomers, such as Beatrice Lestrange, were all well chosen for their roles. There is also enough new content to hold the interest of those who have read the book many times over. The new content also succeeds in advancing the story and filling in holes created by missing story elements (elements that were present in the books). I was also really impressed with the way the movie treats the character of Dolores Umbridge, I was nervous that she would appear too silly in the movie, but she is really well done. All in all, my favorite Harry Potter movie so far!"
808,9,A Worthy successor to Goblet of Fire!,"While not as good as it's predecessor, Order of the Phoenix is definitely one of the top three in the series."
809,10,loved it!,"This was by far the most amazing of all Harry Potter movies! I want to see it again! I loved Imelda Staunton's character; i thought she was really funny and she gave me a laugh or two. Also, i admired Helen Bonham Carter, i think the way in which she acted her small part was fantastic, a real standout for me! I'm a little disappointed with Ron and Hermione in relation to how important they are in the film. This film seems to have pushed them a bit to the back, and they don't seem as involved as they used to be in previous films. I loved the Department of Mysteries battle scene; although short, i thought it was unbelievable. The magic in it, the sounds, all of it made me excited. I recommend this movie for anyone, although i believe it essential to read the book before watching, it makes it so much more entertaining."
810,7,For once I wasn't disappointed - not even a little bit! awesomo!,"Well I went into this movie without many expectations and without rereading the book (it was my least fave) but having said that, this film i enjoyed so much and didn't come out thinking 'omg what was that?' What really made this good was the fact that everyone acted really well for once. Nothing felt too contrived. There were a lot of moments skirted over (i'm glad they cut all that stuff about cleaning out the house) but they kept all the key checkpoints. And for once, one could emote with Harry. His performance was top here and I could really feel his anguish and despair. Well done Radcliffe. What was also a plus was Luna - really well cast as was Umbridge (i was skeptical at first cos at first glance you just want to hug Imelda Staunton)."
811,,Not as good as the other ones,"I have heard people complain about how the film cuts from the book, but this time it is a bit more obvious. However, for nearly 3 hours it obviously has to cut some of it. The bit that makes this film a let down is the death of Sirius Black. It was short and very very poorly done. Even an interesting bit of editing (slow motion reaction kinda thing) didn't save the audience from disappointment. HELLO THIS MAN WAS THE ONLY PERSON HARRY HAD LEFT WHO WAS LINKED TO HIS LOST PAST. Ten seconds of screen time doesn't not do this tragic turn of events justice. For those who complain about the adult nature of this film, it is not the kiss that is the problem, as this is quite tame really- but it is so much darker than many of the others. Remember- this is NOT a children's story anymore. This is more a adult/teen thing now. It may not be suitable for any respectable parent to take a child less than ten along to see it. Special effects- nothing notable really. Shots- beautifully done. Cuts from the book- far too many. However, YOU WILL STILL LOVE IT!!!!"
812,9,"The best one, maybe","Reasons why this movie was excellent 1. It contains quotes from the books, especially Dumbledore. 2. They cut items that needed to be cut. 3. The length of the movie was perfect. 4. The graphics were absolutely amazing. 5. Casting was wonderful 6. It did stay very true to the book, only changing some scenes. 7. They finally found a director. 8. They truly brought out the villain. Reasons you may not want to see this movie: 1. Some editing transitions were choppy. 2. Your scene from the book may have not been added. 3. Way to dark for you."
813,10,Harry Potter's Order Achieves an Outstanding O.W.L.,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a fantastic movie and the most entertaining movie in the Harry Potter series. David Yates manages to pull off the impossible in staying true to the spirit of the book while also giving the movie a personality of its own. Overall I consider this movie to be very faithful to the book even though it may not include everything. My only complaint is the omission of the traitor Marietta Edgecombe. Cho Chang should have been omitted from the film, not given Marietta's role. The pacing of this movie is wonderful and two hours just seem to blow by because of how caught up you get in this movie as a viewer. Although I like the book, the movie is better. This is largely because the movie moves at a much better pace because unneeded details such as about housecleaning are omitted. And some of the changes they made for the movie work quite well. Some viewers were disappointed that the meeting with Neville at St Mungo's was omitted. Apparently this was because the filmmakers did not wish to pay to build a set for the hospital that would not get much use. What they did worked quite well. Having Neville quietly tell Harry about his parents both allowed for more sense of a Harry-Neville friendship in the movie and Neville's uncomfortableness regarding the topic is retained when he says ""I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet."" Apart from omitting Marietta I'm quite pleased with the book to movie transition. The movie keeps itself going while being true to the spirit of the book. The acting and casting are splendid. I especially love Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Her portrayal of Luna is so picture perfect and so awesome that this movie would be worth watching just for that. David Heyman had said that other girls they auditioned could play Luna but that Evanna WAS Luna. This really shows on screen. Ralph Fiennes continued his mastery of Voldemort and Jason Issacs depiction of Lucius was delicious. We have two ruthless cahracters whose true colors show through in their performances and the feeling of danger they present is real. And of course Bellitrix Lestrange passion is awesome captured by Helena Bonham Carter. She really delivers on the madness of the character. We all know how great Daniel and Emma had become in their roles by this stage. Daniel and Emma got better and better with each film in the series and by this point they've totally mastered both the skill of acting and portraying their characters. And even Gambon has improved in his role as Dumbledore. I also like that Harry and Luna are on friendlier terms earlier in the movie than in the book as is evidenced by the forest scene. I always saw a bond between Harry and Luna as a natural so I liked that the filmmakers put some emphasis on that. I can feel the bond between Harry and Luna through the screen. Nicholas Hooper's score is very good albeit not on John Williams classic level. The special effects and visuals are outstanding and the overall production quality is a wonder to behold. The duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort was epic and awestricking. Perfectly shot, perfectly paced, perfectly acted. And I like the progression of darker color schemes as the series progresses as it fits in with the darker tone the stories take. And the filmmakers had a good feel for what fit. The ending shot where the Department of Mysteries Six, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, and Luna are all walking to the carriages together was a perfect example of this. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older. Though less graphic than in the book, the Umbridge punishments scenes are still an issue. Harry's dream scenes and flashback scenes would be too intense for elementary school children. And although the movie depicts Sirius's death as less emotional than Cedric's death in Goblet of Fire, Sirius is a known favorite of many fans. Overall Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an awesome movie! Faithfulness to the book: 9 out of 10. Casting and acting: 11 out of 10. (Bonus point for Luna.) Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10. Loved it! :)"
814,3,Easily the worst movie of the series,Most disappointing. 
815,6,Somewhat Disappointing,"As an avid reader of the books, I have always considered the Order of the Phoenix and The Half Blood Price as my two favourite Harry Potter books. It worries me therefore that David Yates is/will be directing the Half Blood Prince when in my opinion, in the Order of the Phoenix he has failed to capture the full experience which J K Rowling created in her novel."
816,4,"good for kids mostly, otherwise a snore","although the books have also gotten pretty crappy, lots of loose writing and characters that are made to be anything the author might need at the moment, the books are tight and finely wrought compared to the movies, in this installment of the Potter series, we get an older and darker Harry, as distinct from the older and darker Harry of the goblet of fire, we get indistinct adolescent urges, yet again, people doubting Harry's intentions, yet again, and so on, and to top it of, we have no idea why the little glass balls are so important, turns out they really aren't that compelling, weren't in the book either, the motivation for certain character action is suspect, why would Fudge so adamantly not want to deal with the rise of Voldemort, how could such a seemingly powerful wizard as Dumbledore lose control of Hogwarts, and then apparently fight Voldemort at the least, to a draw, and his reasoning for abandoning Harry is simply weak, was in the book too, the death of Sirius Black was confusing and lots of exegesis here that goes nowhere. Essentially, this was a boring movie with lots of empty atmospherics - and sadly, about what I expected, okay for a kids movie and thats not bad, but lets not think that this is somehow better than that"
817,10,Fantastic film!,"Just saw Order of the Phoenix, and I thought David Yates did a brilliant job of translating Jo Rowling's book to the screen. Love the set design, and the acting was excellent. Imelda Staunton was perfect at the despicable Umbridge, as was Helena Bonham Carter in a tiny role as Bellatrix. Harry has become a bit of a lost soul in this movie, and Dan Radcliffe does an outstanding job of portraying him--he's really coming along as an actor. This is definitely the best movie of the series. I particularly liked that David Yates wasn't afraid cast off the tendency some of the earlier films had (Prisoner of Azkaban excepted) to portray the magical world in a very twee sort of way, and instead created a grown-up vision of magic--something that can be exciting but also hugely powerful and frightening. Can't wait to see what he does with Half Blood Prince."
818,7,Everyone Deserves an Opinion,"Whoever said plot and missing parts of a story unimportant can be very wrong. Yes, this was a good movie with good action scenes. But that seems to be a major problem. It seems that too much time was spent on action scenes and special effects. I wanted more storyline fleshed out. I also had a problem with the choppiness of the film. Many of my friends agree that it needed more fluidity. Especially because of viewers, who do not read the book. Those who have not will have difficulties following the plot and story."
819,9,very good,"Thze movie is very interesting..the movie gives you more informations about the past of Harry and Voldemord, so the movie is very important for the story..."
820,8,nice one...,"i will have to agree with everybody, the film is actually good and I bow to the actors that so well performed. at last we have some justice with dumbledore's character."
821,,A series of scenes from the book . . . .,"I'm sorry I didn't re-read the book right before seeing this, but at least I've read the entire six books so far (and seen all the previous movies), so I have a fairly good knowledge of the plot. If I didn't, I would have found this movie completely incomprehensible. It's a series of scenes out of the book, and some of them are quite amusing, but they are simply strung together without any real connecting thread."
822,7,Disappointing,I won't write a long scenario as to why I was disappointed in this film due to the fact that I haven't ready any of the books in the HP series.
823,3,Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix is a waste of time,"This movie is horrible it did not follow the book at all. The movie is first of all supposed to start off with harry sitting in aunt Petunia's garden under the windowsill trying to listen to the news. Then harry was supposed to meet up with Dudley in the middle of a street and then they both are supposed to be attacked in an alley not a tunnel and then miss fig tries to hurry harry along and get out of there with Dudley. And then another big mistake is when harry gets to #12 Grimwauld Place he is supposed to stay there for quite a while and Ron and Hermione receive there prefect badges and Ron gets a new broom from his parents. And also Ron is supposed to try out for the quidditch team and is made fun of by the slytherin house constantly and during harry's occlumency lessons snape is pouring memories he doesn't want harry to see into Dumbledore's pensive and harry is supposed to look into it one day when Snape has to leave the room and sees a young snape in Hogwarts being tortured by harry's father and lupin, Sirius, and petigrew are watching and laughing then harry's mother steps in to help Sirius and then snape pulls harry out of the pensive and his lessons are ended. And the movie also never showed how the Weasley family and harry and Hermione went to see Arthur in St. Mungos and see Neville with his grandmother visiting his parents. Also one of the things i was most mad at is they left out every thing about quidditch because that is were harry, Fred, and George are banned from quidditch for the rest of there lives because they attacked Draco after the match with Slytherin because he was insulting Harry and the Weasley family and Umbridge takes their brooms and puts them in her room. I think the only good scene in the whole movie was the last part the battle scene that is the only reason i rated this movie that high."
824,10,You've gotta see it to believe it,"Saw the film last night and what can I say? BRILLIANT! The great thing about these films is that they keep on improving, which seems like a hard thing to do as they are all extremely good films."
825,2,By far the worst of the Harry Potter movies,"Yes, the acting was excellent. Casting of Umbridge was excellent. The special fx likewise excellent."
826,9,Oscar Prediction,"I feel this film is good on so many levels I wouldn't be surprised, like Return of the King, if it earns an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Supporting Actress Imelda Staunton. Stands alone as a major motion picture, and not just a kid film. My daughter argues that she didn't feel enough character development, however, even in this coming of age book, the focus is on Harry's' inner turmoil and the theme that hardship and tragedy make you stronger. As more characters have been introduced by Rowling, it is Harry's growth and maturity that remain at the center of the story and I felt that Director David Yates captured this beautifully, along with some fine performances from Daniel Radcliff, Staunton, Alan Rickman, and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood."
827,3,First really ambitious and wise movie from the book series of a decade.,"First I must say, that, although a Potter-fan I am, I have not found the other movies pretty good. Harry Potter is a book series, a piece meant to be literature. That makes it a hard one to make into a good movie... and finally someone at least tries."
828,9,The battle truly begins,With this chapter we get our final director and the battle really begins. We also see a darker side of Harry as he turns inward more. The acting is more developed and the characters are growing with story. For the most part the movie stays true to the story with only paring small details. There's a few small jumps but thankfully nothing as choppy as we saw in the previous outing.
829,10,It Is The End,"This film was brilliant, there is no denying it and having read the last book(Which I hope she will forget she said and write many many more)means that there is only two more to go and makes me feel very sad about what is to come. Still a brilliant film though, but I wish they had kept in the bit with Mad Eye Moody at the end of book five is talking to the Dursley's wearing a bowler hat covering his eye and tips the hat up to scare him. Saying all this still means that next year we will be treated to the half-blood prince which I hope will have the high quality of film making and actors that it has in it now. Bring on that one and only one more to go here's looking forward to November 2008."
830,,Only a couple of flaws....,"Okay first off I should say that i am a huge fan of the books. As well as the movies(but more the books). I also must say that the 5th book is my least favorite of all the books. But this is not a review on the book, its a review on the movie. So here we go: First I will review it as just a movie and pretend i haven't read the book: The acting I believe is the strongest it has been in all the movies, from the kids as well as the adults. Imelda Stauton does a brilliant job at playing Umbridge and is exactly like the way I imagined her. The action is awesome. The end fight is just amazing. Although the movie seems to drag at some points but you can easily get past that. The characters are strong and the direction as a whole is quite good, it sets a much needed dark tone casting away the happy go lucky 1st and 2nd movies."
831,7,love this movie,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix lets down the viewers due to not living up to the expecatations set by the previous movies. Its slow paced and boring causing the viewer to lose attention and by the end, it feels like we are still at the beginning."
832,7,A Taste of Things To Come....?,"This was a movie that had the odds stacked against it from the off. Consider the evidence:- 1) It had to repeat the all out action of The Goblet of Fire and 2) had to be successfully adapted from J.K.Rowling's wordiest and character driven book to date. The book is a wash-up from the last as it explores new characters and develops current ones whilst highlighting the rise of Lord Voldemort. The film is good overall as the pace is just about right, although it's just a pity that there was no meaty characterisation for the actors to get their teeth into. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry well and brings the angst, compassion and dare that have made the books so popular. The other more seasoned actors (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes etc) seem to relish their roles also, however, due to the cutting down of the source material (for the sake of cinema), they are somewhat underused. To sum up- an enjoyable slice of entertainment but readers of the book will feel slightly short changed. Having said that the movie sets things up rather nicely for the last two instalments in the Potter saga."
833,6,"Decent, but no where near faithful to the book.","First of all I want to slam the people who automatically vote 10's and 1's all the time, like its the greatest or worst movie of all time. I'm sorry, you should really see a lot more films and you'll be surprised that there are better and worse off films than this."
834,10,perfect movie my favorite,very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.very good movie!!!have a lot of special effect!!!a lot o magic my favorite.
835,1,Worst movie I've seen this year,"WOW! I honestly could not even sit through this one. The fight scene was just horrible, all of the parts that were set at Hogwarts were choppy and could not have been more boring, the scene where the brothers leave is too toned down, and overall, the movie doesn't follow the book at all. I mean really, the 5th book had a TON of useful plot and the director and screenwriter threw it out the window."
836,8,Stop comparing the book to the film. really.,I haven't read one word from any HP book. And because of that I probably have no right to write a critique of the critics. But I have seen all the movies and OotP is easily the best FILM of the HP series and generally a good movie. Keep that non-profane four-letter f-word in mind. FILM.
837,6,Mediocre,"I saw the midnight showing the first day it came out. Looking back, I have the feeling that the movie was better than it was because 3/4ths of the audience was overly tired and would have seen the movie if it filmed the title character taking a crap in the loo for two hours. The movie is very dark (literally AND figuratively...lots of scenes with dark interiors and clouds produce a moody ambiance that at least gets the point of the film across), so it's not the most fun of the previous four. And Hary is just...irritating. I understand the boy is going through a load of hormonal and emotional changes, but couldn't Daniel Radcliffe bother to SMILE ONCE? At least the veteran actors are entertaining (Alan Rickman has about ten lines and the man is still GOD), although I wish Imelda Staunton could have had a little more fun with Umbridge. That seems to be the bottom line...the entire movie and it's components are are burdened with its dark mood, and much of the magic is lost."
838,9,Great movie,"Really worthwhile to watch. Just a pity they did cut quite a few things in comparison to the book, which would have been very fascinating to see."
839,9,This is the best of the Harry Potter films yet,"Part five of the enormously popular Harry Potter machine has kicked off today and it does not disappoint. If you've seen the other 4 films that is. But if you're somebody who likes watching event films, regardless of continuity, then this is the film for you as well."
840,10,By far it has the best acting of any Potter movie,"I loved the movie (I gave it a 10) by far it has the best acting of any Potter movie, but nothing is perfect so I do have 2 complaints."
841,9,Very good film but lacks humor and heart,"After reading all the books so far and seeing all the movies, it suddenly occurred to me that Order of the Phoenix movie left out many of the little humorous touches which make the books so endearing. I thinkthe clearing out of the Black house is hilarious as is Tonks; she gotshort shrift. I missed the house elves both in this and in Goblet ;(Dobby gives Harry the seaweed in the Goblet and he also tells him about the Room of Requirement in Order), both plot devices which should have been included. Also Kreacher should have had more exposition, he just wanders in and out a few times; I think he was actually a lot more sinister. I really, really missed the scene at St. Mungos, especially Nevilles tragic situation, that's what I mean by ""heart"". But most of all they left out the message to Aunt Petunia and her standing up for Harry and keeping him there when his uncle wants to throw him out. This is such an major theme through out the series--the importance of Harry's mother's love and the protection this affords him thru his Aunt Petunia. It would only have taken a few minutes to include. I agree with leaving out the Quidditch as it would have taken up a great deal of time. Throughout, too much emphasis is on action and violence at the expense of humor and ""heart"". However, thanks to all for the books and the movies, we should be grateful we have them at all. Advice to next director: If you want to make Daniel look younger, give him back his longer mop-like hair=do, like Ruperts. His short ""manly"" haircut emphasizes his jaw and thicker neck (sorry, Dan)and makes him look much more mature."
842,7,"Great movie, poor book adaptation","I think this movie was probably the best of the series yet. The acting was superb. The portrayals of Bellatrix Lestrange and Luna Lovegood were closer to perfect than anyone could sanely hope for. The special effects were riveting. The thestrals looked awesome, and Kreacher was sufficiently creepy. Yet sadly this movie also went farther from the book than any of its predecessors. Being the longest, most complex book I watched fully prepared for the removal of sub-plots and many scenes, but even so I was shocked and disappointed by many of the changes. 1. NO DOBBY. That makes two movies in a row where Dobby the house-elf has been written off. 2. NO FIRENZE. It was the Firenze's appointment as divination teacher that angered the centaur's. 3. NO SAINT MUNGO'S. They didn't even go to the hospital, which is where they meet Neville's parents and get to see Lockheart again. 4. NO PREFECTS. Ron and Hermione are made prefects this year and it would have been as simple as letting them be seen with badges on their uniforms to indicate this. 5. NO PEEVES! This is the movie in which Peeves plays his biggest role yet we don't even see him in a background shot. 6. NO QUIDDITCH! Not once does anyone even say the word quidditch. Even though this is the first year Ron gets on the team. Aside from these big omissions they also seem to cut short the Weasley twins grand exit, they cut the speech which is the best part, which is one of the things I was most looking forward to. They heavily downplayed the rivalry between McGonagall and Umbridge. And the had the students using spells they aren't even supposed to know until next year. Levi-Corpus was used multiple times and Harry learns that spell from the Half-Blood Prince. Not once did we get to see Sirius's mum or Buckbeak. So though it was a stupendous movie on its own, avid fans of the book will have to try hard not to be disappointed."
843,8,"More about Harry Potter or Voldemort , it's about choosing side and Hogwarts soul.","In 2020 , watched fifth settlement of Harry Potter series, after witnessing first three fantasy and mystery , after masterclass of Harry Potter from previous , was expecting another clashing between Harry and Voldemort but there has twist in plot which really fantasy,touching,learn inner of Hogwarts and makes me more dramatic to wait eager for next film with can say i'm still satisfied to give 8 over 10 . Overall not disappointing , it's tell about what's actually Harry Potter is and his school. It's will be definite watch movie in franchise . More eager to watch this movie could because the visuals really mind blowing ,more role for ministry of magic, leadership of Potter and Matured Harry Potter film."
844,8,8,"8/10 For the original plot greatly compressed and adapted, the plot is therefore not as good as before the series to make color, color dim to light pollution PTSD feeling."
845,7,Harry Grows And Doubts,"I did not read this book, I know, you hate me. But I can review on the movie on a sole-movie-based-point-of-view. It was good. Because I knew it was sort of a bridge book, I didn't expect too much action, not like the last one, at least. "
846,5,Not good enough,"Finally the wait is over...and yet in the end you wish the movie had never been released. A decent movie but not recommended for Harry Potter book fans. The film leaves you wanting for more and then there are fundamental difference from the book. I personally feel that all book fans should refrain from watching it. The Director in order to create magic in this ""magical"" movie deviates from the original work. The film will receive huge box office success but that is because of all the hype created and not because the final product. the film fails to create the sense of awe achieved in the first two films of the series and casts a doubt on future films based on the series."
847,5,Rushed and watered down...,"I watched this movie with low expectations, having been disappointed with the previous efforts of bringing Harry's magical universe to the visual realm. It is obvious that only a few of the key plot points of an 800 page book can be included in a 2 hours movie, so I will not comment again on that."
848,9,Gets the gist well,"I am a die-hard Potter fan, I dissect the books! But I actually *do* make allowances for the transition from book to movie. I do this by looking at what is missing - ""why was it in the book?"" ""what purpose did it serve there"" - and then decide if the same end was accomplished in the movie even though it might have been skipped or altered."
849,10,Unbelievable,"I have not read any Harry Potter books, whatsoever, except for PoA. But the movies are just as good. They may not include every detail in the book (and may leave out a lot of things), and as my sisters said, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix did just that."
850,9,Very good,The best movie I've ever seen really I love it definitely deserves a better vote
851,5,Worst movie in the franchise,"I am a huge fan of the books, and I must add that all of the movies have failed to impress me. I just wish there was the same level of devotion to Rowling's work in this franchise as there was to Tolkien's work in the Lord of the Rings franchise. The movies are usually decent, but as a die-hard fan I crave to see the sparkle that has made her books so special to me. Of all of the movies in the series, I find this one to be the worst. The director and the screenwriters have obviously not read all of the books in the series. This is just an every-day movie for them. I wanted to see some of my favorite scenes from the Order here; but they were absent or watered down. Some of the really important scenes in the book were completely cut! The screenwriters and director would have had to read the whole series to see the importance of some of these details, which made it obvious to me that they didn't do their research!!!! If I didn't like the actors so well, I would have rated this movie even lower. Yet even they failed to inspire me in this weak addition to the franchise."
852,9,By Far The Best,I don't think I can even begin to describe what I feel about this movie.
853,10,"As a Harry Potter fan, LOVED IT!","I have seen this film and can only come up with one word to say 'AWESOME!'. This could easily pass as the best Harry Potter movie in the series at the moment. It's just like the book, gripping and very dark. The characters were played very beautifully and the new characters weren't on for too long or too short but the times were just right. "
854,,I'm shocked at how few have actually read the books,"I'm shocked at the number of questions that readers of the books would know the answers to are asked on your ""FAQ"" board. Haven't any of you people read the books? The films are nice, but they are no way to really get the ""Harry Potter Experience"". There is so much more depth to the people and the stories in the books. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is my favorite of them all. I haven't yet seen the film of it and I may never see it, because I don't want it to ruin my favorite book. (I've read OOTP five times.) Also, nobody talks about how brilliantly Rowling has depicted the rise of fascism in her tale of the takeover of Hogwarts by the Ministry for Magic. I'll bet THAT doesn't come across in the film."
855,9,"Powerfully done, beautiful and frightening at the same time.","There will be thousands of comments on this movie so I will keep mine brief: Brilliantly done movie from start to finish. Series actors have moved from portraying the characters to being the characters. Stunningly beautiful photography. The soundtrack wonderfully complements and accents the mood and tone of the movie. The new characters are wonderful: Delores Umbridge the acerbic Ministry of Magic appointee; Luna Lovegood adds a quirky charm and purity to her scenes and the Weasley brothers keep things wonderfully interesting throughout, and there are many more who deserve mention as well. The villains are more villainous and the heroes are more heroic. It is an amazing, well-told story that leaves you, at least if you are any sort of fan, hungering for much, much more."
856,10,Love it,"I love all of the Harry Potter movies but this is my favourite one. Some people think it's slow and thats fine, but I especially love how this movie concentrates on the relationship between Sirius and Harry. I feel like this movie captures the emotion really well and Harry has good character development in this movie."
857,4,Disappointment,"I just couldn't believe when the movie ended. I read the book so focused and patiently and when I watch the movie I was so disappointed... really. Well, I loved the images and the colors, the landscapes and the visual effects. But the scenes were so dis-coordinated. The scenes weren't on the right spot, for instance, when Sirius Black shows Harry the room with the portraits of Black's family - the scene was supposed to appear in the beginning of the movie and it appears almost in the end... I also think that the scenes appear and disappear too fast. But what could the Director do? I mean, he had to transform a book with 750 pages into a movie with 2 hours... It's a movie to see but it's not a great movie. Sincerely I hope the next one to be a little better... I've enjoyed all other Harry Potter's movies and this one just...well, didn't appreciated it."
858,4,"Eh, amusing but not great...","So while it is a continuation of the storyline watching this movie was like opening a book and reading 20 pages somewhere in the middle and then closing it again. While it had a ""plot"" it doesn't really grip you or make you want to see more. There is no dramatic build up and no ""cliff hangers"" to keep you wanting for more when it's done."
859,3,best of all the hairy pooters? NOT saying much,"i kept waiting for harry to pinch the bridge of his nose and shake his head outside of the emporium. i can appreciate him appreciating dazed and confused, by that's no study for 'brilliant' acting. or perhaps, he'd scream nooooo.....after volvomat cut his hand off and told him he was his father. all in all, i thought it was a 'brilliant' 2 hour commercial for video games, lunchboxes, happy meals...whatever else they can push on the sheep that not only allow this sort of cinematic travesty, but demand it. i did see the chick that plays hairminy on letterman tonight and she flashed a national television audience. at least she had the decency to wear some knickers."
860,10,Stands on its own as a classic movie for muggles and magicians alike...,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best of the five HP movies to date, but really stands on its own as a classic. Had I never seen a previous Harry Potter movie or read the novels, I still would have found this an amazing, mysterious, imaginative, quick-paced drama. The acting is top-notch throughout, and Daniel Radcliffe really comes to his own as Harry, filling out the character with believable and engaging emotional reality and intensity. Though set in a context of magic, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix is a coming-of-age story at its heart. The lessons the title character learns--coping with loss, managing feelings, nurturing friendships, taking leadership, discovering romance, finding one's own stand in a world of conflicting moral values, encountering adults as a youth--are universal themes, and the world of magic and Harry's unique relationship with the Dark Lord accentuate and accelerate these challenges and Harry's ""real world"" education. The spiritual, moral, interpersonal, and emotional themes of the plot are vivid and coherent, but there are numerous humorous vignettes throughout to lend some balance to a generally troubling story. The special effects do a great job contributing to the story and are a fitting tribute to J. K. Rowling's vision. All-in-all wonderful entertainment for eye, ear, heart, and mind. "
861,8,Harry's living a dream,"If you read the book: I think that this movie hit on more points of the book then any other of the Potter movies, as brief as some parts were. I know some think it didn't follow the book , but they cant make a 10 hour movie. The part with Graup could have been extended more as well as the Centaurs. They went dark with this film as was advertised, it has left the realm of children's book and now is more adult based. I do and don't agree with that, I don't because it started as a children type movie and isn't really made for the 4 to 7 year olds who were drawn in by the first 4 movies. Why i do, is because it has made the film much more intense and more attractive to a older viewing audience. "
862,8,Getting better and better,"I admit to being a huge fan of the books and a moderate fan of the movies,a although I've only seen them a few times each. I knew bits, some favourite subplots, would be removed for time so I won't make any reference to removed plots lines or differences, simply reviewing the movie for what it is. However I will assume you've either read the books or seen the previous movies, simply because explaining each term would take too long."
863,4,The weakest Harry Potter film to date,"I found this a disappointing film though it has some successful new characters. Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge may not be in the least toad-like, but she so perfectly captures the smiling, 'girly', evil of the book, while Evanna Lynch has captured Luna Lovegood perfectly."
864,9,"Bow Down to David Yates (Now this is what i call a ""film"")","HP has always been associated with kid's stuff. Magic, sorcery, and poor screenplay. but HP5 was way different. If Chris Columbus was pitied over by Alfonso Cuaron, this time, both of them were pitied over by David Yates. Such courage was taken by this director as i saw the movie. this movie might not be able to be on top when you talk about gross sales..but in terms of artistry, its way above the average line. as i quote the newspaper review, ""realism overcomes magic and sorcery."" In the previous HP movies, we were overwhelmed by the special effects, the new fashion sense, the new characters, glorious scoring and other petty stuff, and on the end, left us with the question ""what was it all about?"". no lasting effect. it just ends there and there. the ex-movies were like cardboard. hard and plain. HP5 is about feelings, emotions, struggles, mature friendship, and growing up. compared to the ex-movies, time is spent now on every dialogue. silence is being inserted already, allowing us to feel and comprehend. not to mention the unparalleled performance of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge."
865,9,"Playtime's over, now it's serious business","After the first 15 minutes, I could sense that this wasn't going to be like the other HP movies. This one has a dark, gloomy mood about it which isn't helped by Harry's frequent temper outbursts. As Dumbledore put it towards the end of Goblet of Fire (HP4) ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"", so this installment says it all. That means that for Harry, Ron and Hermione and their friends it's no longer enjoyment and pleasure as usual."
866,1,Not Happy,Who dose this Cocacolaguy912-9 think they are what we should all jump to your attention on your movie rating and yours should be the only one and how you say you make fun of people because you don not like their thoughts on this move and that they are jerks well i feel sorry for you not.Well i think Cocacolaguy912-9 that the movie is a rating of a 1 out of 10 much more could have been in this movie David Yates made a bad move with this movie compared to the other 4 which he had nothing to do with that says a lot and were far more liked as they explained far more than this one.And to say it would be suicidal to add more for David Yates well i think that it stinks that we all paid a lot of money to watch this movie and did not get what we paid for. As for the actors i will not rate them in this movie as i like them all i can not see what everyone is talking about the new Dumbledore in my own opinion i quite like his acting but each to their own.
867,7,"The worst book, the worst film...","As an avid fan of the Harry Potter books I always get quite defensive when the film goes against the book or misses out important bits. I found the other four films enjoyable and well done even if they didn't quite follow the books but this film, I did not feel, met their standards. The best aspect, I feel was the casting, as the characters were well chosen, especially Luna Lovegood! However, the acting wasn't great and the pace of the scenes were too slow. I didn't feel that the characters were as easy to relate to and they seemed awkward and wooden. I also felt that the film didn't go into enough depth and for someone who had not read the book, it would have been confusing and vague. Overall, I felt that the film wasn't up to scratch and found it vague, slow and slightly dull. I understand how hard it is to adapt a book as great as Harry Potter and of course the film is worth seeing... just, don't expect a great deal."
868,9,The best Harry Potter adaptation so far...,"My first piece of advice is the same as it would be for any other cinematic adaptation of a book. Read the book before you watch the movie. There are a couple things (Who sent the dementors after Harry, why Fudge refuses to believe Voldemort is back, etc.) that are never fully explained in the movie. For anyone who didn't read the book and wants to know Umbridge sent the dementors after Harry in an effort to discredit him. As for Fudge: he is, to use Dumbledore's words, ""blinded by the love of the office"" he holds. Voldemort being back would seriously jeopardize the power he has as Minister (not to mention that the idea of Voldemort's return is just too terrifying) so he simply ignores the facts."
869,9,A mature turn on Harry Potter (HP) movies,"Admittedly; after HP 4, I was scared that there wouldn't have been any other movies with that scale of magnitude. Brilliant dialogs, awesome special effects, and everything that a major fantasy movie should have. Now things are changed. You can definitely forget the whole ballet of the fourth movie, and enter into the real Harry Potter World: a world of solitude,pain and doubt. This movie has a lot of ties with the third installment of the series; the same darkness, the same imminent sense of tragedy; most ultimately, the same sense of doom. Without revealing too much of the plot, we can definitely say that we begin to understand Harry's personality for what it is for real: traumatized."
870,4,"Good acting and special effects, poor directing, writing, and editing","JK Rowling has created a world so rich with texture and vivid descriptions that we can live everything from the smell of the kitchen stench at the Leaky Cauldron, to the feel of the sheets at Hogwarts. Unfortunately, she brings one other element into her book that bastardizes the entire work; her reliance on worn out literary devices. The order of the Phoenix is rife with them. First, we see friends that turn on Harry for terribly poor reasons just for the sake of creating tension. Last time in was Ron, this time it is Seamus, and various other people throughout the series who sort of just go along with whatever the stronger willed characters tell them to do. Even Dumbledore has been seen to accuse Harry of wrongdoing when there was little or no proof and his past record is of absolutely candidness. (Goblet of Fire)"
871,10,Superb. The Best Film Yet.,FIRST WORDS: I implore you to go see this movie. It is worth your trouble. 
872,2,Great if you have not read the book,I wonder what it takes sometimes to be a screenwriter for a major novel. I felt that this was a good movie if you had not read the book and had no idea of the flow of the story and any of the details. It moved slow and was not at all suspenseful during most of the first half.
873,4,A disappointment,Could have been much better. Fred and George's contribution to making life hell for Umbridge was not portrayed at all.
874,9,If You Love Harry Potter See this Movie!,The Director David Yates clearly deserves recommendation for making one of the biggest Harry Potter books into an enjoyable movie experience. He seemed to hit each important part of the book and loop them together to make the story flow. He also made the fight scenes very entertaining. I hear from other critics that they are disappointed with character development but in honestly this is the fifth movie and you know the character by now. The only problem I had with it was the same problem I had with transformers; the final fight scenes are to confusing and fast. You really do not know what is going on. Besides that the movie is great and a must see for any Harry Potter. Just a reminder the book is big so some stuff needed to be cut out.
875,3,Sadly disappointed,"The only reason I gave it any stars were from the casting, and Umbridge. She did her part well, which means I loathe the woman! I have been raised within the film industry and this film was abysmal! Even if you were not expecting something from a book, the whole film was disjointed and did not flow from scene to scene. It bounced around and was extremely confusing. I know the content of the film is darker, but that does not mean you need to make it seem like a black and white film."
876,8,Good...But not as good as other Harry Potter movie's,First of all let me say I have never read any of the Harry Potter books. But I am a fan of all the movies.
877,10,Spectacular,"I have seen Order of the Phoenix twice, and it still blows me away. And yes, I have read all the books more than 3 times, and I still love the movie. David Yates did a fantastic job in choosing the scenes that were relevant to the plot, and although the movie went by relatively fast, it didn't just ""hop"" from one major event to another. I don't know why everyone is complaining about how long the movie is. In 138 minutes Yates managed to get the general idea and mood across while adding his own style. You always felt the plot was moving; there were no side stories to slow it down. Everything fit in place, everything worked. Plus the DVD will include deleted scenes, making non-fans of this movie hopefully happier."
878,9,delightful indeed,"With a very impressive directing, flawless acting skills and, precision in technical data OOTP deserves accolades or higher ratings when compared to the previous movies of this enchanting series (with an exception of POA)."
879,7,Reviews both brief and late,I know it's a bit late after the release but I've just got round to watching Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix and I must say I was impressed. For those of you getting frustrated by the childish nature of the previous movies and their failure to remain true to the books will be pleased that this one is stepping ever closer to being true to the book and also being made for adults.
880,10,"Wonderful film, although a lot was omitted","In my opinion, this was a absolute masterpiece. They could have put in a little more, I'll admit, but it had wonderful emotional value."
881,7,A good adaptation from the book ~~coud have been better,First time i saw the movie when i din have the habit of reading at all but i enjoyed it though i could only get a overall view of the movie and not anything about it deeply.Just few months back i started reading HP books and i loved it.Then i wanted to see the movie how it was portrayed from the book.First thing i observed was everything was going fast in the movie.Many scenes from the book have been shortened or not used at all.Few things which i thought were missing are 1)No quidditch in the movie.Ron found a place in the team and harry was given a life ban..nothing appeared in the movie..2)then hagrid..he had too little scenes and his face should have been more damaged...3)The timing of few scenes were different from the book..4)They never mentioned ron and hermione were prefects ..Fred and george's departure was justified to some extent i would say..other than few flaws the movie is good..if u just wanna follow the movie w/o reading the book u can but u r missing a great excitement present in the book..yes as many users say its somewat hard to follow w/o reading the book.I would rather recommend them to read..The book is awesome...
882,10,"Lets not get surprised by the brilliance, its their habit!","OK, Harry and the Order of the Phoenix blowing the International Statute of Secrecy while flying level with the boat and under a bridge in plain Muggle sights really put me off but seems like David Yates heard my thoughts and instantly vowed to make the rest of this movie a memorable one. And boy did he succeed! Hats of to 1)Daniel Radcliffe 2)Rupert Grint and 3)The girl who makes the most ingenious metaphor or simile look stupid in front of her radiant beauty, Emma Watson, this is what I always do but I don't know why this time they pulled out all plugs and gave really superb performances."
883,8,Harry Potter and the Screen Redemption,"After an arduous wait of three days I finally went along to see Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix (my favourite of the book series)this afternoon and was pleasantly surprised as I thought after the film of Prisoner of Azkaban the screen series has suffered. However David Yates has included what was necessary for the plot to flow properly and although it lacks the humorous frivolity of the book, it allows images that have been floating around the book readers' minds to appear on screen with spectacular results."
884,10,"Amazing, although it leaves some out...","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was amazing, and everything that the director included was done exactly how I wanted it to be done. However, it's what they cut out that detracts from my rating. Three of my favorite scenes from the book were cut (Umbridge in McGonagall's Class, Rita Skeeter's interview (cutting out Miranda Richarson should be a crime), and Umbridge trying to sack Hagrid), and they limited the ""War on Umbridge"" at Hogwarts. Although I put my rating at 10, it's really a 9.5. "
885,10,Best movie adaptation of a Potter book,"In my opinion, this is the best movie adaptation of the Potter books. I enjoyed seeing the visuals that I could only picture in my head while reading the book. The battle at the department of mysteries was choreographed really well and I really enjoyed seeing the DA in training as well as the old picture of the members of the Order. The portrayal of the dementors attack at the beginning of the story was so much darker than I imagined. I'm so glad we had a brief glimpse of Kreature. I just wished Jim Dale did the voice over. He is amazing in the audiobook. I never expected the movie to be able to retain all the details in the book, but I wish we had more of the Weasly twin pranks and were able to see more details about James Potter's torment of Snape. The movie also failed to explain the reason why Harry was lured into the department of mysteries ***warning spoilers*** as only the subject of a prophecy can retrieve the record. Noteworthy was Daniel Radcliff's acting. He really matured as an actor in this movie. The actress playing Luna was outstanding, she really brought her to life, with so much softness and so much humanity. Gary Oldman did a real moving portrayal of Sirius Black and dominated every scene he was in. This actor has an amazing ability to express so many emotions without saying a word. When he got hit with the Ava Kedavra curse, I made a loud gasp, even though I knew it was coming. The look on his face was a mixture of surprise, sadness, fear and love for Harry. He is just an outstanding actor. Helena Bonham Carter was born to play Bellatrix Lestrange with her evil laughter and her piercing eyes. Snape appeared much nicer than he is portrayed in the book and we do not see Lilly Evans defending him like in the book. Finally, the lady who played Umbridge was phenomenal. I know she got an Oscar for Vera Drake, but she certainly deserves one for this movie. She delivered an unbelievable performance as the sadistic, manipulative and cunning bureaucrat that sucks the joy out of life. We also never learn that she sent the dementors against Harry in the summer. My only disappointment is that the fountain statues did not come to life like in the book."
886,7,Harry Potter: Disorder of the Phoenix,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix isn't a bad film, but it has obvious and glaring mistakes that keep it from being on par with the other Potter films. It's barely ten minutes into the film when Nymphadora Tonks utters ""Don't worry Harry. We will explain every thing when we get back to headquarters."" Sadly nothing could be further from the truth."
887,10,Its A Movie Not a Novel....,Firstly I want to say that this comment is coming from a big big hardcore die-hard fan of HP. As I said if you're going to watch the novel than you'll be disappointed because so much is cut in the movie that a die-hard fan of book will not be delighted as happened to me but when i watched it second time i thought this was the best potter yet. This was the first potter movie in which i really felt that i am watching a sequel. Previous two were completely indifferent from each other. However reason I always enjoyed HP movie is that i never compared them to novel.5th is one of my favorite & this movie did justice to it. There are emotions there is action everything is there to make a perfect movie.
888,10,The first HP movie which lives up to the book,"I really thought that HP and the OotP was fantastic! The cast are a little more polished and it was the first time I've left an HP movie without feeling like something significant was left out - that is, this really did justice to the book."
889,10,I loved it,"I got to go to the advance screening, and this is the best Potter film yet! They have a perfect balance of darkness, humor, and romance. Evanna Lynch is perfect for her role. Imelda Staunton too. At one moment, I was so angry at her I had to literally clutch on to the movie theater's armrest to restrain myself from throwing my shoe at the screen! They even kept the ""emotional range of a teaspoon"" quote in! I would recommend seeing it RIGHT NOW if you can. The battle at the ministry was a little weak at the beginning, and the marauders get about 20 seconds of screen time, but it was still amazing. I will forever have nightmares because during occlumency, they show Ickle Harry looking in the Mirror of Erised at his parents, and then Snape is In The Mirror. This movie gets a 16 out of 10!"
890,9,Best Harry Potter movie!,"I loved this movie, It was amazing. Absolutely amazing."
891,8,Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix,"PG(Supernatural Themes, Stylised Violence|138MINS|Adventure, Family, Fantasy Users need to know that even children who can't read know about Harry Potter, and even children too young for the film's content will want to see this fifth installment. This has been the case with each succeeding film, as the children have gotten older and taken on bigger challenges, the themes are darker, the violence becomes more intense, and the climatic battle sequences with 'Voldemort' and the Death Eaters are very frightening. SPOILER ALERT: There is a very upsetting (bloodless) death of Harry's godfather (Sirius Black). As a result, he becomes even more aggressive and furious. Harry has his first kiss in this installment (SPOILER ALERT), and Ronald and Hermione flirt occasionally. "
892,9,It's Fine. Not the best book to movie adaptation,Credit where credit is due: this movie took over 800 pages of book and allowed it to move at a breakneck pace. 
893,5,Disappointing to readers,"I'm a grown-up muggle who looks forward to All Things Harry way more than is probably appropriate, but OoTP disappointing to me. Maggie Smith is perfect, as is Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and the actor who portray Harry, Ron and especially my girl Hermoine are wonderful, too. The last two movies have just been such superficial renditions of the books. The CGI effects are very much improved over the first few movies, but at the cost, it seems, of the emotional truth and depth of the first movies. Harry and Sirius are on screen together for what... six minutes? Umbridge? We see hardly any of her true wickedness! It was bad enough how Cedric was a cardboard cut-out in TGoF, but now his murder is marginalized from everyone's emotional landscape. I just felt a little cheated at all the shortcuts."
894,3,Subtle as a brick,"Great cinematic beginning, but it's all down hill from there.<br /><br />Nearly every scene is overwrought.<br /><br />Emma Watson's hammy breathless line delivery is distracting.<br /><br />""Control your emotions!"" Snape threatens Harry in yet another over the top scene, where of course no-one controls their emotions.<br /><br />Because emotions are dramatic and exciting and box office baby!<br /><br />*Every* scene is played for *maximum* impact. There is almost no breathing space to be had in any of it.<br /><br />Poor old Daniel Radcliffe, whose obvious direction was to _yell_ every line of dialogue and look utterly miserable/enraged.<br /><br />An exhausting watch."
895,7,Ripoff,"i am like the biggest harry Potter fan, and with everyone making a big deal about the movie and having an awesome trailer, i was REALLY looking forward to watching it. However once it started it was like the first 3 chapters in 5 mins. The whole movie revolved around Harry Potter, i mean sure the movie is called Harry Potter, but Ron and Hermione only had like 15 lines in 2hrs and something-minutes. I'm also a huge supporter of Snape, and i've understood that they only give him like 3 lines in the movies, but i was hoping they'd give him some more attention during the Occlumency lesson scene, his memory was like 3 seconds long!! it's the longest book and i know they can't put everything from it or it would be too long, but it was the shortest movie they could have at least put in ONE Quidditch match. A Quidditch match scene would have only been like 10 minutes at most. My favorite Harry Potter movie is still GOF, i was really disappointed, and i'm glad i chose to watch it at a normal theater first before deciding to go IMAX, it's not worth it. However, if you want to go watch it, go right ahead i'm not saying it was THAT bad, but it's not worth spending more than $12 at IMAX, the trailer is more exciting, its like all the action scenes without the boring scenes in-between. The whole thing seemed rush, as if the director was looking forward to finishing."
896,6,What should have been left in...(minor spoiler),"Visually, OP is stunning. The special effects are socko. The acting is good, especially Evanna as Luna Lovegood. All that works. "
897,8,Well Worth It!!!,"All I can say is: Wow, what a great film!!!!!!! I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan and only saw the 5th movie just last night. The special effects and acting were AMAZING. The actress that played Umbridge--WOW! She did an amazing job."
898,10,"In my Humble opinion, The best film yet!","I thought that OOTP was the best film by far, many of the characterisations were excellent (Evanna Lynch, Helena Bonham Carter and Imelda Stauton stole every scene th were in)."
899,8,"Great movie, slightly disappointed","I love how the film was made, the effects were brilliant but I was greatly annoyed to find how much had been cut. Some of my favourite scenes in the Ministry Of Magic were completely cut. These include when Nevilles' nose is broken, when Hermione is hit with the unknown curse and many other scenes. None were included. I found this to be greatly disappointing in terms of keeping to the book but I guess the movies have never done THAT much justice to the book anyway. I was expecting this to be the better of the 4 so far, in effect and humour ways it was. "
900,10,Luna = THE MOVIE!!!,"Okay, lets get started, so. i came to the movie, never had read any of the books with no intention to. As i am an average teenager who only reads books assigned in English class. But for me, these movies are enjoyable. For most, and myself, whether they end up corny, i always feel i have to see the next one. This movie left me disappointed in areas, and Loving it in others. i couldn't decide which. For reasons i didn't like it, the movie didn't have to much detail to it. Like, in the other movies, there is just MORE to it, like quiditch matches, and all that stuff. This was to plain. and yet it was a good length of a movie, it seemed to only go on like an hour and 15 min. I did find that they didn't ad as much to Ron as usual, which for me, was GREAT. I am not a fan of his character, or the actor. Another plus was when i met in the movie.....Luna. Her character was almost perfection for me. She Made the movie for me. Her voice, wondorous acting, the look, and the personality. What does make me mad is that the connection between her and harry will not last. =[ Though it was perfect for this movie for her to be in it do to all his anger junk. I give this movie an 8."
901,8,Almost almost there!,"first i've to say good choice of director! he(David) has covered most of the scenes which r expected and that's good! but there r some scenes which may change in future, some scenes which that should be shown! a scene in which bellatrix uses 'avada kadavara' is actually not there in the book because in the book it's not mentioned which charm she used on sirius so i think these kind of important scenes must have be proper! and there r some scenes which r unable to understand who didn't read the book! so apart from that the scenes shown r brilliant! all casts acted brilliantly! some brilliant scenes r there which makes u smile! whatever he had done had done brilliantly! GOOD WORK David BUT BE CAREFUL ABOUT THOSE IMPORTANT SCENES!"
902,,If i hadn't of read the books I might have been inclined to really like the movie,"While I don't think it was a bad movie, I think after reading the book I had too many expectations for the movie to be just as good. I feel that for a movie that ran as long as it did, there was ample time to go more in depth about some of the more important parts of the book that were left out or altered altogether. I feel some of the biggest issues could have been a more involved development of why umbridge was the way she was and her disdain for non-humans, harry's confusion and sympathy for snape and doubt about his father and sirius' actions as students, and even the down played roles of jenny and luna. i could go on and on but those are some of the things that bothered me most after seeing the movie"
903,9,"A good FILM, not just a good Potter","Imagine Star Wars remade in the style of the X-Men, and you just about have it: a tense fantasy thriller with just the right balance of humour and action. For a night out at the cinema, it's a pleasant diversion. For a Harry Potter film, it's a miracle."
904,8,As a fan of the Novels & previous movies I was not disappointed!,Being that I read all of the books I was a little anxious about what aspects of the book would be kept and how well other things would translate into the film.
905,8,Best harry Potter movie yet!,"I have seen all of the Harry Potter films and I have to say I really think this one is by far the best. For those who have read the book, you'll be really surprised at how loyal the movie adaption is. It definitely keeps the magical spirit of love and friendship that JK Rowling writes. It's definitely not mushy though, it's full of action and dark magic though not like Goblet of Fire where Harry just seems to jump around and there's no storyline. I could definitely tell all the actors had been really pushed to give their best possible performance, even a few of the regulars who are usually pushed up the back had heaps of lines to say. I was really glad about this because I think all of the actors really have a lot to give to the movie and they never get the opportunity. Usually Harry Potter films only stand out for special effects but this time there are plenty Oscar-worthy performances. I rate it eight out of ten only because there was the occasional weird moment that came out of nowhere and some story lines like 'the kiss' were simply done for the sake of it and eventually abandoned. Other than that it's a great movie, I've never seen the cinema so packed!"
906,2,The worst harry potter by far,"This was so bad. This one was the one that would really begin the series. The army against You Know who is back, and yet this was still weak. They missed some giant plot stuff, and the screwed up with cho."
907,8,My least favorite of all the movies so far... but still good,"Well, as a certified Harry Potter (adult) addict, I must say that although this is technically a great movie, it does leave the die-hard book fans wanting more. While visually, this movie is stunning, and at the end of the 2 hours, you understand the basic plot, there were so many important plot lines left out. With an additional 1/2 hour of time, all plots could have been marvelously developed, and the watchers could have been brought into Harry's world with so much more understanding. Daniel's anguish was not portrayed at the opening. His loneliness, desperation, and isolation do not come through to the audience. Who are the Order of the Phoenix? Why are they there? What type of family was the House of Black? None of this was portrayed. Also, where was the mirror given to Harry by Sirius? Without it, how can viewers understand the mystery and guild Harry feels with Sirius's death? How can they understand that if he had only used the mirror, Sirius may have remained alive? All in all though, for non-insane book readers (unlike myself), who don't look for deeper meanings and connections, it is still a wonderful, although dark, story which leaves you with the basic understanding of the dark times to come. I'm still looking forward to all the rest of the movies, and hope that with a little extra play-time, which all Harry Potter fans are more than willing to sit through (as long as there's lots of popcorn), movie audiences can hopefully be brought into the extremely important next few movies with a deeper understanding of what J.K. writes about."
908,7,"It's a decent film, but it could use some work.","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix went by so fast. You can imagine how little filler there has to be in a movie that crams 700+ pages into 2.5 hours. I mean, Lord of the Rings got three hours per 350 pages, and the plot moved fast enough in those films."
909,8,A very enjoyable movie,"Finally, after the failure of Goblet of Fire, another good Potter-movie! First of all I'm not a huge fan of the fifth book: too long, especially in the first part; too much elements and a little sense of boring during the reading. So I came to the cinema yesterday night without great expectations and...surprise I saw a really good picture. What I like: 1) The new characters: Dolores Umbridge, Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix Lestrange are absolutely fantastic in this movie adaptation: especially Brenda Blethyn did a wonderful job with her acting. 2) The screenplay: the first, boring part was cut off and this choice is really good for the rhythm of the entire movie. 3) Daniel Radcliffe: this young actor improves his acting movie after movie and the scenes of the nightmares and of the Voldemort's possession are absolutely terrific! 4) The atmosphere: finally a really dark, scaring harry Potter movie; Harry's nightmares, Dementors first attacks are only a few scenes that can create, during the movie, the sensation that now the childhood is over and that a really, cruel wizard world is going to begin. What I dislike: 1) Cho Chang's story: too short; it's not clear how she felt in love with Harry and the reason of their kissing. Plus, the reasons of their breaking aren't so exhaustive as in the books. 2) Grop: generally I appreciate the special effects in this movie but Hagrid's brother is really too false to seem real. Isn't impossible to choose a real actor and make him appear bigger than the other characters ? Doesn't Lord of the Rings movies teach anything about these technique ? 3) The Story of Neville Longbottom: yes, his role is getting bigger and bigger in every movie but the book was able to create a sense of big suspicion regarding this boy (what if was Longbottom the boy of prophecy?), in the movie there isn't no words about that. What a shame! But these lacks doesn't change my review; I went out the cinema really enthusiastic. It was fun, it was scary, it was intriguing. Best Potter's movie with the Prisoner of Azkaban"
910,8,- Rank in no.3 in my list for favourite HP movie --,"mini review! I've just got back from watching the movie, and IMO it was a great Harry Potter film. It ranks in third place behind POA and GOF IMO.As you all know,It continues it trend to become a much more darker film than GOF and much more serious! Harry rarely cracked up a smile, but hey! It was needed in this film to match the dark story and the overall tone that this series is taking."
911,4,Disappointing movie,"The OOTP was my favorite book and i was so hyped to see the movie only to leave strongly disappointed. The movie, in terms of a movie, was great with excellent effects and acting but as far as the storyline of the book it was awful. Did any one else notice that Ron had like 10 words the whole movie? Everything seemed rushed and a lot was missing like the entire time spent at Sirius' house, visit to Mungos, the actual way Harry and Cho fell apart, Ron and Heremonie becoming prefects/ and no Quiditch??? There was no plot building only a ton of climaxes which would leave people who didn't read the book confused. Professor Umbridge and Luna Lovegood were well played,though. What was up with Umbridge blowing up the Room of Requirement door? And the entire DA having detention with those special quills? And the lessons Occumencly lessons with Harry and Snape? And Sirius dying so suddenly then going through the archway? It was horrible i was so mad. This was a awesome book with a lot of information that was rushed into the shortest Harry Potter movie ever. Yates seemed to disregard the story and turn this movie into a typical Hollywood fantasy action movie, which is unnecessary and uncalled for. "
912,8,Not the best Potter Movie,"This movie was indeed your typical Potter movie but it was definitely not the boy wizards best outing. Although in places it was a little boring, it was indeed a good movie. True fans of the book however will be a little disappointed. The character of book 5 seems to be lost a little, with far too much emphasis being placed on the depressive aspects. With ""Weasley is our king"" being left out completely and the happier times included in the novel being very underplayed. Sirius Death has also been butchered and true fans such as myself will be left disappointed."
913,8,The movies have FINALLY nailed it! O.O.T.P. is Astounding!,"As a fan of the books; every single film except for ""Azkaban"", and especially ""Goblet"", was a disappointment to me. Not this one!"
914,5,Major Spoiler Warning,"I saw the movie last night, and I was thoroughly confunded (if the once who have read the books will pardon my pun). It wasn't a bad movie (it was actually quite sweet and beautifully filmed) but I have been reading these books for like half of my life and I have very little tolerance for writing out important ingredients like Peeves(a real loss) and not letting Tonks take as much place as the character deserves(this goes for a lot of the characters. I wont write the entire list; all you fans of the books know what they are"
915,7,Confusing yet Understandable,"first off let me say i haven't read this book, so this review is based on what i thought of the story as a movie."
916,7,Good but better for non devotees,"Its odd that this instalment has been said to be the best thus far, as although I enjoyed it there was somehow a bit of lingering disappointment after it was all over."
917,8,"While not the best Potter film overall, it is certainly the most distinguished in several areas...","By the time most franchises have reached their fifth installment, it has either undergone a drastic reinterpretation or has become so tired and repetitive that it's hardly worth a look. What a joy, then, to see that the HARRY POTTER franchise is still going strong, with its newest actually improving upon its immediate predecessor. Also, unlike the first two films, it manages to create a nice balance between the need to be an adaptation of the much-beloved book but also work on an entirely cinematic level for the uninitiated. This balance strips the tale down to its barest bones, which works both for and against the film in the end."
918,8,A few jarring moments,"After the theatrical viewing: Wow, the production hit the highlights, though severe pruning remained obvious and, in places, greatly disappointing. The big battle scene was impressive, though impossible to follow who was fighting whom. Couldn't wait for the DVD to rewatch that scene."
919,9,Good,"It´s my favourite movie of the series, but i hate Cho Chang character."
920,4,Low Expectations,"YES! All of us who read the book knew that the film was gonna be bad. But besides taking a lot of things off the film, they just put more stuff completely out of sense. No quidditch? Bad call."
921,10,"Excellent, best Harry Potter movie (many changes though)","OK, I've only watched Order of the Phoenix once....but I know if I watch it again I'll still think its an excellent film. The Potter films have gotten more better with each movie, because the actors have developed a lot since the first movie (they were young at that time)."
922,5,My Expectation Bubble Burst and it wasn't good,"Our family had high expectations for this Harry Potter movie. I had thought the last one was over the top in story, action, cinematography. I was on an adrenaline high when I left it and couldn't wait to see it again when it came on video. My daughter has read all the Harry Potter books, more than once. I read the first one so I am coming toward this not as how true to the book, but from the pure entertainment value. It was a good movie and we'll worth attending to see on the big screen, but not near as good as the prior Harry Potter movies from action and cinematography. Maybe they were trying to be true to the book so they included some of the chit/chat sequences...They were so staged and seemingly irrelevant all that did was make me feel that these actors were doing it for pay check with no heart in it at all. We bought tickets in advance for Friday night thinking it will be packed out. Our theater was empty...maybe 20 people in it at 8:30 on a Friday Night. Granted, that was probably the exception than the rule, but still, I don't think you are going to have a lot of repeat attenders and word of mouth won't be as positive as in the past. I can only think the change in directors caused this outcome. It seemed so staged, as the kids, Harry & Co, lined up to walk in a V formation across bridges, through doors, not like they were on a mission to save their world, but because somebody told them to line up this way and walk in place while we move the computer animation behind you. It would be so obvious that the background was computer generated....of course a lot of it is in fantasy movies, but let us think it is real like it was in the goblet of fire. What I liked: Scenes with Harry teaching the kids (when he finally gets his chip off his shoulder) magic, the revelation about Snape being picked on by Harry's oh so nice dad...but why leave that hanging, the fight between Dumbledorf and Voldemort, the sense of this secret order that has all the people that Harry trusts and the old picture of all the folks that were against Voldemort, some having turned to his side. BTW, my husband liked it and my daughter the reader loved it!"
923,4,Is Potter losing his magic?,"I think that this is probably the worst Potter yet. Not because it was particularly bad, it just wasn't a patch on the first 3 or even The Goblet of Fire which I also felt somewhat let down by."
924,9,"Not the best Harry Potter film, unfortunately",As a huge Harry Potter fan I diligently went to the midnight release of the film and after which I felt compelled to voice my opinion on it:
925,8,I'm lightly disappointed...,"...don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as i expected it would be, when i saw the trailers. When i heard that they didn't stick to the book completely, i thought, ""never mind, i wont let that bother me"". But they really left some things out, i thought were very important. Quidditch for example. I'd like to know, how the explain Ron being a keeper, when there's Quidditch in the sixth movie. And the thing with Harry and Cho...well, someone here wrote it ""Cho didn't do it, damn it!"" The way it looks now, Harry broke up with her, though it went the other way around, as far as i remember it. Things like these were one factor. Another one was the editing. I don't know how to describe it, in some scenes it was just strange...for example: former scene: Harry's sleeping and rolling around in his bed, cut... Harry's on his way to the subway station. know what i mean? The thing, bothering me the most was the music. i so looked forward to another awesome soundtrack, but in my opinion it didn't came out as good as in the former movies."
926,,Review 4: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"There is no doubt that the new entry in the Harry Potter series is well acted and well crafted. Even so, though, it is the worst in the series so far. The Ministry of Magic is growing concerned on Harry's claim that that the Dark Lord (Voldemort) is at full power again. They try to wart off Harry's claim by trying to get him expelled, but they end up failing to do so. So they decide to send one of their workers (Dolores Umbridge) to take a job at Hogwarts. When she arrives, she begins to take over the school and makes the students read about magic other than use magic. The students begin to fear that they won't learn how to protect themselves using magic and look up to Harry to help them learn to do so. So Harry and his friends begin to train the school secretly and everything begins to start off just fine, but Harry is having dreams about a room in the Ministry and begins to see terrible things (like Mr. Weasly being attacked by a snake). Then Dolores finds out that the students are learning magic without her approval. Once she finds out so, she takes over the school as head master and Ministry tries to take Dumbledore to Azkaban. Then Harry has another dream that his uncle (Sirius Black) is being attacked in a room at the Ministry by Voldemort who wants him to get something in the room. So, Harry's friend and him go to Ministry to confront Voldemort and find out whatever Voldemort wants. I don't think that the problem with the film is that it is too dark or that the characters seem more older, but that it skips some info from the book. The movie is too short (even though it is about one-hundred-thirty minutes long) and some viewers may not understand stuff in the movie if they have not read the book (even though they should have read the book). Overall though, it is a good movie and think fans will enjoy it. Overall: B"
927,9,best yet.,"I watched this movie before i read the book, once i got done with the book i did notice things missing. But that doesn't change the fact that this movie was still brilliantly made. Yes the reason so many things were taking out was due to Goldbergs screenplay (but if J.K. Rowling. approved it then I am sure there's a purpose for the missing material) However, David Yates is what made it brilliant, everything he had the actors do was fantastic and i think it is one of the best Harry Potters yet. One thing i didn't like about the movie was the fact that the book was so long but the movie (although still a good time) did seem rather short. But the effects that were produced and the final 20-30 minutes of the movie were just breathtaking. i recommend this for anyone who is into fantasy movies, whether you like the Harry Potter series or not. this is still just an amazing, interesting, breathtaking movie that will keep you wanting more."
928,5,Mediocre,Good Points 
929,5,Lackluster imitation of the book,"I was one of the harry potter fans set out to watch the movie on the first day of it's release, only to gather a very disappointed experience. The movie was highly manipulative in nature and deviated from the book in each and every aspect."
930,7,it could contain spoiler . i don't know?,"I was disappointed that they skipped Quidditch. i wanted to see a bit of that . like when Ron was heaving trouble with it and stuff, Wesley is the King!"
931,3,Not the Best Potter Film!,"There are thousands of book-based films that were a let down for the readers, but I must say this was a real disappointment. The movie contained no quid ditch, which is no problem, but the entire movie is just about getting Harry's schoolmates and the Ministry of Magic to believe that Voldemort has returned. There was some mild action, but I won't be getting it on DVD. Definitely not worth the $10 and 138 minutes of my life. I've seen the majority of movies to hit theaters this summer and this is not one of the best. May I suggest Transformers, Ratatouille , or Live Free or Die Hard."
932,8,"""Potter"" Movies Only Get Better","Previous reviews of this film were heavy on criticism of certain themes being removed from the film. It is important to note that J.K. Rowling has a heavy say in what is put into the movie and what is removed. That being said, one can safely remove all disappointment as it was not a Hollywood decision."
933,8,if we just pretend there was no book to be based on the movie would be better than it is now,I first saw the movie not long after it had been released here in Australia. I had really liked all the previous films( thougth no where near as good as the books) and went in with high expectations and fortunately was not disappointed.
934,9,"Best of the 5 ""Potter"" movies so far","I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say, it was the best of the five Harry Potter movies they've made so far. True, things were cut out of the movie that were in the book, but how would YOU adapt a 700-ish page novel into a movie? You only have room for about half of the stuff in there. I saw the movie in I-Max, but you only wear the 3-D glasses for the last 20 minutes. And those last 20 minutes absolutely blew my mind. Special effects galore, explosions, magic... this movie probably had more special effects than any of the other Potter movies, possibly two Potter movies combined. But it wasn't all about the eye-candy; the acting was superb, the storyline seemed to flow very smoothly, and Dolores Umbridge and her antics had me cracking up. There was one part (not going to say which) that was poorly explained, but it wasn't enough to ""disenchant"" me. Go see it, you'll like it. 9/10."
935,10,Great Movie,I love the book I love the movie. Fans may or may not enjoy the frusturated Harry. I personally enjoyed it. Just my type of movie. Although certain things were cut we all have to be real. You have to draw the line somewhere. The ending scene is really cool and just how I imagined it. I can't way for future Harry Potter films. The acting was also very good. I am hoping they keep up the great adaptions. The director really uses great special effects and good camera angles. If you haven't read the book you might want to or else you might be a bit confused.The new actors and actresses are extremely great. Luna and the new Dudley are a charm. I hope you enjoy the film just as much as I did.
936,6,Where is the Order of the Phoenix?,"No matter what people say you can't separate the movies from the books as has been suggested. This movie wasn't bad. It has great special effects, especially during the last 25 minutes of the movie. The problem resides in the fact that the writer of the screenplay forgot what the book was all about. The book was about the Order of the Phoenix, and sorry kids, but the members of the Order were adults. I understand it is impossible to live up to the expectations of the book, which is infinitely better than the movie. But if you have a great bunch of British actors, together in one set, Shouldn't you use them? You don't sign Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, Emma Thomson and the wonderful Brendan Gleeson and use them as background decoration! Their characters are interesting and vital in the books. The best scenes of the movie occurred precisely when the adult actors are on scene. The producers and director seem so keen in keeping the Harry Potter movies appealing to little kids that apparently they think adults in the set will bore their young audience. A word of advice: 1)many of the people who go to see these movies (as well as read the books) are adults. And I am not talking young adults, I am talking adults over 30. Secondly, the dynamics of the young students and the older teachers is one of the greatest assets of the books. Why don't use that? Daniel Radcliff has shown he can grow as an actor and it shows in this movie; and he really shines when he is with the adult actors. Guys, producers, writers of this movie, the really cool people in this movie weren't Harry,Cho, Luna, Hermione or Ron. The really cool people, the masters of magic were Tonks, Lupin, Sirius, Mad-Eyed Moody, Kingsley and of course Dumbledore. Your loss if you decided to give them three lines each, so Harry could have a longer kiss with Cho. Also I would like to add that the soundtrack of this movie was much much inferior than any of the four previous movies. As one of the fellow users said, ""music does matter."" And also I would like to say I wouldn't have mind a three hour movie either."
937,9,Substance...with flash,"It was a joy, an absolute joy to see the main characters of Harry Potter depicted with some gravity. For four films (yes I did say all four)these young actors have had ""the emotional range of a teaspoon"" and largely through no fault of their own. Hollywood has a continual and annoying trend of equating fantasy with one dimensional, frequently paring their characters down to one and two word descriptions (i.e. hero, comic relief, girl power, wimp) that erodes them into nothing more than black/white,cardboard,stick people spiced up with a little humor. Not so with David Yates. Here, in this fifth installment, we are all of a sudden faced with people: Real people. They are full blown, colorful, effective. They remind you, on the eve of the last book of the series, how much you actually like Harry and how much you really want him to win this battle against Voldemort...somehow. This could not have been accomplished without Daniel Radcliffe's heartfelt performance. I don't care how much quidditch was added or whether Snape's memory was longer. Without substance this movie simply would have been a flash in the pan. It did not need more special effects, it did not need to be darker, it didn't even necessarily need the swamp. What it needed was the one thing all four movies have not been able to produce; acting that was befitting the characters and respectful of the work it came from. David Yates pulled that off in spades."
938,10,I loved it!!,I have read comments from people about how certain parts of the book were left out. But I think with this film they included all they needed to. Tonks' hair is unimportant. I do think the prophecy could of been explained more. Perhaps about how Neville could of been the chosen one. But I suppose thats not really important. I thought Daniel's portrayal of HP in this film was excellent. He really showed the weight on Harry's shoulders throughout the whole film. Really I was pleased with all the actors in the film. They all added a little more to make the film come to life. Esp when Harry is possessed by Voldemort. Wow. Overall yes more could of been added and yes a little more detail to characters hair etc but I loved the film. And I cannot wait for film 6 and book 7.
939,9,Harry Potter in IMAX 3D,"I've never read any of the books (but my sister has, so she fills me in on what was missing from the movies) so I always see the Harry Potter movies without expectations of what I want to see in it. I thought the movie was excellent; perhaps the best so far! But the 3-D effects were disappointing. They were very good, and were quite effective in showing vast spaces, but they could have been a lot better. If you've never seen a really well-done 3-D movie (like the ones at Universal Studios in Florida) you should thoroughly enjoy the 3-D in Harry Potter. But having seen what is possible in a 3-D movie, where things can seem to actually pop right out of the screen and into the audience so it looks like you could reach out and touch it (or get hit by it) it's easy to see how much better the 3-D in Harry Potter should have been."
940,7,"good film, but still not nearly as good as the book","For me, Order of the Phoenix was the hardest of the books to get through and also the one that I enjoyed the least. But, as it was the longest - it condensed easily enough. I always feel like the HP movies jump around a lot, and I'm often confused as to how someone who has never read the books can follow them. Regardless, this movie was indeed entertaining. I cheered, I scowled, I laughed - it was all there. I still do hate that so many of the story lines from the book are changed, but I understand that you just can't have everything...and sometimes things need to be simplified here or expanded there to allow for some ""movie magic."" To all you Potter fans out there, do go see the movie (just keep an open mind) - BUT then go read the book again to remind yourself what really makes this series truly wonderful."
941,6,Interesting and thats for sure,"I have learned after watching POA, that time crunching and focusing on the important details in the book is a given for any movie in this series that will be less then two and a half hours. And in this latest installment that is exactly what we are given."
942,9,The best yet,"Finally, a Screen Writer and a Director who actually read the book."
943,10,Wooooow.....,"First i want to say for those who read the book 5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,they will for sure be kind of irritated when they see that some parts are not the same at the movie and that there is a lot of changes.Some parts are missing,some are added...And for sure,those who read the book,are going to expect a lot of this movie.But i want you just to stop and think about for one thing for a second-if they make a movie to be just like the story in the book-how much do you think the movie would last?I would like to say that I'm amazed how they created this movie.Its a lot scarier,a lot exciting,the acting of characters is just getting better and better.I am amazed how they described some parts of the book and put it into movie(the coming of dementors,the occlumency lesson with Snape,the dream of Harry being a snake,the department with mysteries and killing Sirius Black and Harry's pain at that moment,the part when Voldermort turn inside harry etc.etc.etc...)i am veeeeeeery satisfied. Thos HP movie is really great and one of the best.I just hope that the next one is going to be just as exciting as this one."
944,10,Order Of The Phoenix is the Empire Strikes Back of the series!,"how could a Pottter fan go wrong with this one? blissful visuals. I don't know where they found David Yates, but I am pleased to know he will be directing Half-Blood Prince as well & will be looking forward to his future projects to come."
945,5,One more opinion,In my opinion this is the worst of the Potter movies (despite being an excellent book). If you're a HP fan (as I am of the books and movies until now) you have to go see it of course but I'd advise against getting your hopes up.
946,7,Hits and Misses in acting,"As far as plot goes, it matches exactly that in the book, though only the essential plot is portrayed. Most of the details which made the book so popular has been edited away, which is understandable. One of the reasons why I saw this movie was to see how they manage to cut the book down to a 2 hour movie. But, fraid not, the plot still manages to keep you in your seat throughout the movie."
947,7,Based on the Novel is an Understatement,"I can't believe that Order of the Phoenix was based on the 5th installment of the Harry Potter series. There have been complaints about what was cut from the book, but this is just mind blowing. To begin with, months before the movie's release I rushed to the book and reread it, couldn't wait to see my favorite parts on the big screen. As a child I'd originally read the book just picturing Ron's tottery attitude in the Department of Mysteries while being attacked by the brain. I wanted to watch him try out for the Quidditch team- ""Weasley is our King"", anyone? I'm sure I'm not the only one who couldn't wait to see Hermione's plans for the house elfs, he mention of Percy and his family issues? Snape's worst memories were what I'd really been waiting for. You can imagine my astonishment when I got that 2 minute snort or blurry fuzz. "
948,6,Not exciting at all !! David Yates - Bad work ! You who enjoyed it : WHY ?!!!,Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix - the worst of the harry potter movies..
949,8,If you have not seen the movie it may give some opinions away.,"I agree the movie was alright but way to many important facts were removed. Even my son noticed that about 4 chapters in one area were removed. Voldemort must not be much of a wizard Mr. Weasley did not even end up that hurt after the attack. The book shows that he almost dies the movie shows that he gets hurt. The fact that Harry feels guilty about Sirius' death could have been shown better if we understood more about harry and Voldemort's connection. If we also understood how hard Sirius tries to help even though he is told not to. There should have been more about Neville's parents that is an important piece about his character for later movies unless he just going to get dropped out. This movie shows more about the character relationships but does not explain the hardships that they go through. With Harry and Choe, their break up brings him to his next love but it does not even show that he is a normal young teen who likes girls."
950,2,disappointed with potter :(,"i thought this film was absolutely rubbish< i really was looking forward to seeing it as the first few were brilliant this however was not . i wanted to see Ron make the quidditch team and i was throughly disappointed with the content, the room in the department of magical mysteries in the book was described as round and revolving with doors all around there was only one door and the room wasn't even round! "
951,10,"An Exciting, Mature Leap Forward","Of all the films in the Harry Potter franchise, the fifth installment marks the first time our hero truly earns his place in story. This time around, Harry must contend with the newly-enfleshed Lord Voldemort, the media (or the equivalent of one in the wizarding world), and the prim and proper Dolores Umbridge, the newly appointed Defense Against the Dark Arts prof. Times have changed in the world of Hogwarts, and not for the better. Harry and Dumbledore face an uphill battle against the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, both of which seek to discredit the duo's claim that He Who Must Not Be Named has indeed returned to re-ignite his reign of terror. Believing that they are in grave danger, Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to school them and his fellow classmates in the art of defense. "
952,6,Entretaining but...,They say a picture can say more than a thousand of words. In this case... I say the book said a lot more that the movie.
953,8,"as a film very good, but a poor adaptation of the book.",o.k the main quarrel people have with this film is that it is far too fast paced and unexplained as it cuts out major scenes from the book.
954,8,Couldn't have been any better...,"One of the best films of the series. I myself am a big fan of the books as well, and I think they did an excellent job of telling the story even with the cuts that had to be made. If you go in obsessing over the bits and pieces that they missed, you probably won't enjoy the movie. I thought the acting in this one was also a big improvement over the past installments. Everyone did a great job. Once again, awesome movie!!! My fiancé was with me when we watched the movie, and he loved it as well and he isn't even a fan of the books. There was a lot smoother connection between this movie and the one prior than in the past. I can't wait to see the next one."
955,2,"Don't bother, maybe the DVD will be better","this film has a lot missing. I have not read any of the books however this film has so many problems you can tell it has been cut to shreds. new characters appear and are not introduced. The flow of the story is shaky at best. The film is titled order of the phoenix but does very little to be involved regarding what the order of the phoenix is, who they are etc. It seems that the cinema's have been waiving their arms again not wanting long movies so they can have more showing which has completely destroyed this movie. I was very annoyed that although i had not read the book I could clearly see it had been hacked. Actual fans who read the book prepare to get upset."
956,1,Hodge podge of hastily thrown together scenes,"The viewer is hastily thrown from scene to scene in order to squeeze 900 pages into 2 hours. The red thread, excitement and context have been lost in the adaptation. Some talanted new actors appear but unfortunately we are still stuck with the underperforming casts from previous films."
957,10,The best Harry Potter movie to date,"Even though this movie doesn't follow the book exactly and doesn't contain all the plot lines that the book does, it still is my favorite Harry Potter movie to date. David Yates definitely did a great job with capturing the tone and the spirit of the fifth Harry Potter book (which happened to be one of my favorites in the series), and Dan, Emma, and Rupert's acting just continues to improve. Dan especially shone in this movie, displaying Harry's complex emotions and his relationship with Sirius perfectly. Rupert's acting caught me off guard with how good it was as well- his scenes really showed that there's more to Ron than just the comic relief he's served so far in the movies. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD--- The scene in the Ministry of Magic where Harry is possessed by Voldemort was, by far, one of the best in the movie. I personally liked that scene more in the movie than I did in the book- but that's just my opinion, of course. Also, the kiss scene was excellent and followed the book perfectly, and the scene following it in the Gryffindor common room was absolutely hilarious. --END SPOILERS"
958,4,'Imelda Steals The Show' because she's the only one with any LINES.,"I came into the theater last night, looking forward to the newest installment in the Harry Potter franchise. Yeah, the previews looked good, but I hadn't know they put all the best parts in the preview."
959,10,"Darker, better and grown-up!","Being a hardcore Potter fan, in both books and on the big screen, I though 'Yates has got to put almost 900 hundred pages into 2 hours and 15 minutes' and i expected like the other films, it would just be a mediocre adaptation. Boy was I wrong! To begin with, Potter 5 was much darker. It pushed it to the borders of a 12 film and almost into a 15. You might think that's bad, but people love to be on the edge of their seat and love to be frightened and Potter does and immense job on that front. It's not just a mellow film with a scary climax, it's dark all the way through. Also, Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have grown up in their acting big time. The film is set in the period of the characters adolescence, the period in your life where you start to say 'I don't agree with that' and Radcliffe and the others don't fall short on that front. Oldman and Staunton also give great performances as Sirius Black and Dolores Umbridge, but Alan Rickman outclasses both on the sinister front, merely by raising an eyebrow, as his performance is truly the definition of sinister. Finally, there is more action, which keeps the viewer in suspense and keeps them interested. This time round, they also managed to cut out minor parts of the book, which doesn't leave out vital information, unlike the other versions. All in all, Potter 5 is a fantastic, dark and action packed film which is enjoyable for anyone and I recommend it, even if the other films have put you off."
960,6,"Further down the spiral, the magic is now completely gone.","Episode 5 brings us more of the same. the movie tries to summarize the big book in which (too) many details and story lines are described. The summary is actually quite good but, as part 4, has the killing effect of too many things in 2 and what hours. Therefore the movie is very hasty, giving the actors hardly the chance to act properly. As a matter of fact, the most characters have very little acting time. That makes it hard to empathize with the main characters and leaves you no other choice than to sit back and try to enjoy the many special effects (which are not all that great). The 'children' are becoming too old for their roles. I think it will become a big problem in the next two movies. It is a children's story trying to become mature. Therefore it's way too childish. The simple fight between good and bad, the magic of the first three parts, it's disappeared."
961,6,Visually enthralling...Story wise awful...,I am a Harry Potter fan. I have always loved the books. But i have always been disappointed by the movies. The first two were the best and stayed true to the story of the book. But since the third there's been a disastrous change. 
962,7,Not as intense as it should've been,Here's my review. I just got back from the movie.
963,9,Very Good Movie.,"Harry potter and the Order of the Phoenix is awesome. The only objection I had was the length of the movie. The first few movies contained more of the original details from the book. This was because they were based on books that were much shorter. I believe that they should have made it three hours long because too much info is left out from an 800 plus page book. The movie itself was great, awesome fighting scenes and spectacular visuals. It all went together really well. I believe this is the first time they show full grown wizards going at war with each other. Showing the full potential of what a mature wizard can do in battle with his wand. It seems that the acting is getting better as well. As the years progress and Harry gets older there's much more talent on screen which also makes it more convincing. There are a few new magical creatures introduced as well as some new concepts that were pretty neat."
964,5,Once again I was Disappointed by the inabilty of people to accuratley bring across a brilliant - if long winded - story.,"Though the cast and setting remain unchanged since Alfonso Cuarón (The Prisoner of Azkaban) changed the path of the saga, the Harry Potter series has decidedly taken a turn for the worse as the director  David Yates - allowed the adults to take control of the movie. Although in fairness there were several points where the emotions of the young cast members were brought forward with spectacular effectiveness. Admittedly the acting seems worse than it really was due to the shoddy dialogue that often gave way to spectacular monologues that were cruelly juxtaposed with the short poorly written lines of the supporting cast. The entire 138 minutes of the film was climaxed with the last 15 minutes being the only worthwhile scenes. However, and I have to bring this to the fore as the character that is quite possibly the most important  other than Harry himself, is once again destroyed by the eccentric and overwhelming performance of Michael Gambon. Once again the director is to blame, for the fact that Dumbledore appears incredibly weak against the might of Lord Voldemort, and whose entire character and personality is modified. Voldemort I have to say was quite possibly  with the exception of Gary Oldman and Imelda Staunton  the best adult performer throughout, portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, Voldemort is given a purely evil face by this spectacular actor. Imelda Staunton does a brilliant job as Professor Umbridge, however her character was just a tinsy bit overdone, but that may well have been the intention. Helena Bonham Carter did a brilliant job of playing the deranged sociopath Bellatrix Lestrange, escaped to serve evil once more, and as she faces Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) who also did a fine job of portraying his character. Over all; the last 15 minutes of the film, the few good performances, the two flying scenes, coupled with the incredible musical score are the only parts of the film worth mentioning. Even and perhaps most disappointing was that sorry special effects that were used, with the giant Grawp looking like something out of Shrek. "
965,,"Harry Potter, a surprising letdown?","so i saw the 12 o clock show of Harry Potter and its really hard to say whether i liked it or not. maybe because i was half asleep the whole time, but something about it wasn't as good as the others. it was still an exquisite show special effects, but it disappointed me. i mean, sure, i went into it believing it was going to be amazing because i have every year since the first harry potter movie came out and they all have been far better than my already high expectations. "
966,8,"Finally, a Harry Potter film worth watching without throwing up","Having seen (and being bitterly disappointed by) the previous Harry Potter films, filled with cheesy grins and superfluous acting, I went in to see The Order of the Phoenix without too much expectation."
967,9,The last 20 minutes are a masterpiece,Daniel Radcliffe made a huge leap forward in his acting for this film and also the pace the cinematography was fantasitc and the music for the film especially accompanying the order's flight to the order is simply breathtaking in nature. The best scene in the whole series for my opinion it was all there. The story I know everyone knows by now. Of course there are detractors who feel the film was streamlined and marginalized in order to make the pace better I feel this is true and I could not agree more with the decision you can make a film shorter that is usual and still make it feel epic and grand in spite of that very fact.
968,9,Time for action !!!,"Dark times have come !! Its not a kids movie anymore. The movie begins with a bang and its action all the way to the end. Quite a deviation from the book, but an awesome movie none the less.If you haven't read the book it might be a bit to much to bear i feel, since so much is not explained and just mentioned in the passing. There are a few duologue's which were too good(like the ""I must not tell lies"" when umbridge is being taken away by centaurs !). Rowling will be proud of this movie. Dumbledore's Army was awesome on screen. The weaseley's fireworks was also very well shown. Hagrid was hardly in movie for a few minutes.No quidditch in the movie. What I really missed was the fact that they hardly showed hogwarts at all in the movie. It was all about the dark times and voldemort and umbridge etc. There is no school fun shown in the movie basically. Acting was awesome by harry ! Its really mature. Luna lovegood was also very well done.Hermione was kind of OK too.Umbridge is reallllyyy creeeepyyyy.You'r gonna love it. Overall and awesome movie !! enjoy"
969,8,Harry Potter has become a man,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the best Harry Potter movie to date. Its predecessor, Goblet of Fire, was a huge disappointment to me the first time I watched it. The beginning was hurried and confusing and by the time it got to anything good, my first impression seriously hindered my enjoyment of it. Order of the Phoenix, however, was brilliant from the start  I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story-line did not deviate, as it has been know to do in the movies, and there were definite hints of what's to come. I was totally impressed by how far Daniel Radcliffe's acting has come on  he showed real emotion and depth - he really was Harry Potter. Emma Watson on the other hand  what happened? Her performance has slowly been worsening since her excellent performance in the Prisoner of Azkaban. She was too dramatic nearly all of the time, and had a really annoying habit of, when it was her line, taking a deep breath, striking a pose, and speaking r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. Rupert Grint's performance was as good as ever and Imelda Staunton was magnificent as Dolores Umbridge, as was Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. This movie was in no way disappointing and I eagerly await the official DVD release. 8/10"
970,7,"A Fine Portrayal, Yet Not The Cinematic Equivalent Of The Book","While the first two Harry Potters were made in a very classic way, no unconventional things or matters that in another way were different book, this is what made them a good movie version of the novels. The third and fourth tried a more dark approach, with a new Hogwarts. While I found the third movie satisfying, the fourth movie was atrocious in my opinion, rushing over everything, giving no complete feeling whatsoever, deleting important and cool parts, and replacing them by useless scenes that were either 'spectacular' or funny (the dragon chase, which made no appearance in the book, lasted about 15 minutes). However, David Yates seems to understand better that a movie needs dialogue and character development. Granted, the fourth book was more action-packed while the fifth contained more character development and dialogue. Yates however, especially in the beginning, uses the time to create bonds between Harry and Sirius for instance, introduces Luna Lovegood in a clear way, etc. The issue with the last few films is however still present in this movie, and that is the fact that many facts are not explained (Grimmauld Place, Order of the Phoenix (!), WHY and how they exactly went to the Ministry could have been much more clear). Of course, Rowling wastes little time in explaining most terms and characters from previous novels, and this justifies why Yates doesn't make this movie for non-readers. However, independent from the book, the movie is not individually a good work of art. Not like The Godfather, The Green Mile, or The Shawshank Redemption, does the movie explain itself and needs no explanation by reading the book. Therefore I conclude this movie is a very nice visualisation, a concrete interpretation of how things look that are described in the book, with some memorable acting (Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane and Maggie Smith seem born for their role)."
971,7,"Harry Potter 5 is good, but not good enough","Wow, a lot to say for Harry Potter 5. First of all, I think that with a book this good, the directors can't really mess this movie up too much. That's a good thing for the directors, because they really messed up on some major parts of this movie. "
972,1,SACK the director (and anyone responsible)!!!,"As a great fan of the books, I went to see this movie as I had done for the last 4. And it proved to be the worst ever! I had thought I had been disappointed by film 2 & 4, (1 is excusable) because they were children's films, but then I hadn't seen this one: It's not as if they were lacking the money to pay for screenwriters, good actors, and a director who knows what he's doing. My main point of criticism is the lack of coherent story-telling: Even if they had good reason to reinvent the story and change everything around; still editing a movie is about more than just chopping some scenes and putting them together! I completely missed a golden threat! It's like in a puzzle where the pieces are related but don't quite fit! And then it isn't really surprising that even though we find some really good puzzle pieces, such as Alan Rickman's brilliant performance of Snape or Staunton's Umbridge, the final sum is (a lot) less than its components! Which , I believe, is a great pity, for: not only contains this book more fundamental ideas (DA coins, the locket, Kreacher, the two way mirror, the Ministry...) and people( Bellatrix mainly, some Death Eaters, Tonks, Kingsley...) that will be developed further in future books, than any other book so far, it also lives by its great detail and most of all: by Harry's EMOTIONS. But where were they????? "
973,1,Horrible,"So I am assuming that the man who wrote the screen play for this movie got drunk and read spark notes instead of actually reading the book. The was by far the worst movie adaptation of a book I have ever seen. Nothing flowed what so ever. Nothing was explained. Not once did they explain why Percy had a look of loathing on his face when he saw Harry Potter. Luna used the levicorpus spell even though first of all Harry doesn't even learn that spell until the next book and second of all, that spell is a non-verbal spell. The picture of the original Order of the Phoenix it showed ""Mad Eye"" Moody with his magical eye but in the book Goblet of Fire we found out that during that time, ""Mad Eye"" had two regular eyes. How is it that the Wesley twins are going to disrupt the test for the O.W.L.s and they don't show them having to re-take them. The movie did not show how Harry, Fred, and George were kicked off the Quidditch team and that Ron and Ginny made the team. Quidditch was never even brought up once during the entire movie even though in my opinion it was important to show the growth in the character of Ron by becoming a good keeper. I wonder how they will explain the sudden arrive of Ron and Ginny to the Quidditch team in the next movie. There are many other reasons why I was disgusted by this movie but I do not feel like discussing them. All in all, I would have to say that this is the worst Harry Potter movie ever made and if the next two are anything like it, I do believe that Harry Potter fan base will dropped significantly."
974,10,amazingly good but could have been tremendously good,i loved it personally i have read the all the books just got done with the 7th one not 5 minutes ago i loved this film. But i could have been better its missing the quidich matches which was a very important subplot in the book. This movie was missing a lot BUT all that was made up in the wonderful performance's by the cast Sirius was funny and courageous Dumbledore was calm cool and collected Kingsly was funny and bright but overall the characters that shined the most were that of Daniel Radcliffe who gave his Best performance which is of much relief do to his poor acting in 4. Evanna Lynch shined in this movie as the fan favorite Luna Lovegood and she is Oscar worthy for her performance. Imelda Stanton made you hate umbridge so much she played the role magically truly a horrible person in the film which she made you hate so well.
975,,so not the best,"i have no doubts that the director of this movie is a good director at other things but as far as this movie goes it isn't the best yet it was put together terribly and left out many things that some may find important to the plot most say it was because they didn't want the movie to be too long they just had to put in the important stuff and yes if u had never read the books you would not have noticed but most fans have and it was sickening to me that they would leave out so much, true fans would have set through any harry potter movie even if it was 3 hours long so saying he has made the best one yet is far from the truth i find it revolting that people would think it was yes it had more magic than the others but as far as giving you the whole story its the worst one yet i am a big fan and have read all the books many times and every time i saw them skip over something even something small i just wanted to walk out of the theater so for him being a great director i cant argue with that but as far as this being the best one yet you are strongly mistaken"
976,10,The Best Harry Potter Adaptation,"Order of the Phoenix is arguably the most difficult book to adapt because it's the longest, and Michael Goldenberg wrote a phenomenal screenplay that captured and even expanded upon the major themes and essence of the book. Even though some of the plot had to be sacrificed for time, the heart of the book was still there and that was something that the rest of the Potter movies lacked sometimes. The script in addition to the performances from Daniel Radcliffe and Gary Oldman and their heartfelt onscreen relationship puts this movie in line with other iconic fantasy and franchise movies like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars."
977,,I don't think so,"I don't think this film is as good as other HP movies. There is a huge gap from the book to the movie. The best part of the book as i think is the climax and Fred and Georges work what is shortened in the movie. this two scenes could have done better.Some parts were unnecessary but were in the movie. And the director did not give much importance on DA. But the acting of Harry potter, Ron and Dolores Umbridge is very good. I like there acting. But this film is not as good as other HP series. Screenplay would have been better."
978,10,A gripping adventurous masterpiece.,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for me is my most favorite movie of the summer. It keeps you on a firm grip without letting you go, it is witty, magical, and fantastic. I viewed this movie on July 28, 2007 in the IMAX, it's 3D effect makes it feel like your actually in the movie. This movie grasp's you that well, its fascinating how they do that and how it feels so real. At most times of the movie, it feels dull, because its story puts no use to the series, its short and isn't much at all. That was my disappointment. It was also a bit boring if you don't pay attention with full thought, because if you do it will have you on a very firm grip throughout."
979,10,Absolutely incredible!,"This was one of the first times, that I've been so engrossed that my over-thinking brain didn't try to analyze the correctness of the movie to book. It was absolutely engrossing, charming and fun. High energy. I loved every minute of it. I did wish some parts were expanded a bit but I was thrilled with the outcome. Especially after the slight feeling of disappointment with the others."
980,3,What a Waste,"My daughter and I left the theater wondering exactly what just happened. Surely we didn't see a movie, as not a single part of it stuck in our minds."
981,6,"I'm entertained, but not stunned","For a Harry Potter fan like myself i thought the movie was awful. The storyline was a copy of the books, it was almost like reading the book a second time. I expected more for the 10 dollars. Ron Weasley is a funny character, but this time he went from Hero to Zero. The dialog was embarrassing and the acting was terrible. A bunch of overgrown kids with no touch. Still it was exciting."
982,3,Juvenile emotional spasms,"God, I just don't get how so many people are so into this series. All this hype about, ooh, the dreaded Voldemort. You'd think that the guy would be truly nightmarish, but, after we've been forced to stomach two hours or so of superstar Harry's emotional self-indulgence, Voldemort (who, by the way, MUST NOT BE NAMED, in case you hadn't heard enough times), finally shows up (sans nose, how scary!) and runs with tail tucked when enough Hogwart bigwigs show up. I guess he just couldn't hack it when Harry decided not to embrace the dark side, er, I mean, resisted Sauron's ring of power, er, I mean, didn't want to be his buddy."
983,6,Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phonix.,"Before going to see the new Harry Potter movie i had to acquaint myself with the characters and films. Im more of a Lord Of The Rings type of guy. I watched all the Potter films on DVD and enjoyed them somewhat. After seeing the new film i found it much more enjoyable then the previous films. This film seemed crisp and new compared to the other films and not a lot of dull dialog that the other films had. The story line was enjoyable and the action was swift. I don't think i would recommend Harry Potter to children, but for adults it was a good two and a half hour escape into the world of Harry Potter. Im not familiar with the books, but it was sad to see my favorite character die. Long live Sirius Black."
984,8,It was okay,I go see Harry Potter every year that it comes out and this year was no different.I actually got to go to the sneak peek. I really enjoyed this one but at the same time I don't think it was one of the best. I know reading the books and watching the movie are two different things but this time it was way off course. Lots of the details and scenes that were described in the book didn't show up in the movie at all. It wasn't a major loss but I don't think I would recommend people trampling over each other to get inside the theater. =/ I really would like to see what the critics have to say about the film this year and I want to hear from other people who saw the movie as well.
985,7,A good movie that is put to shame by the book.,"Of course I know that you can't have everything... but why make the longest (and one of the best) HP books into the shortest movie? The plot basically followed the book, while leaving some rather important things out, but I expected this of a barely over two hour movie that was supposed to follow an 860 page book. My basic complaint is again, the shortness of the movie. I felt the characters (since there were so many new ones) got little screen time and some of the best parts of the book got shortened so they seemed like nothing at all (ie Weasley Twins, you'll know what I mean if you've read the book.) Overall, this is OK. I expected things to be taken out, but this was so fast paced and left so many things cut short that my brother (who had not read the book yet) had to ask me several times during the movie what the heck was going on."
986,7,Normal Harry Potter experience,"I'm giving it a 7 because of the fact that the only original thing they did was improve the special effects. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, well as good as you could expect from someone trying to turn a book into a movie, never quite comes out right. Once again the acting of the cast is sub par, quite appalling for the now 17+ actor Daniel Raddcliffe, his acting is choppy, sometimes even over dramatic, and that's saying much for the limited actor that he is. Actors Evanna Lynch(Luna Lovegood) Mark Williams(Mr. Weasly) and a few of the others, including Emma Watson (Hermione) are the only ones that really play a convincing character. Not to mention the fact that Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) is an over dramatic actor, the Goblet of Fire movie can completely complement this statement, where he shrieks at Harry Potter when his name comes out of the Goblet. Often times he either over-reacts or under-reacts. They couldn't have chosen a worse replacement for the original Dumbledore. Besides the obvious flaws, one being that Harry Potters scar changes sides during the duration of the film, switching from the right to the left side. It's what I've become to expect from the Harry Potter movies, they've switched directors more often than one changes a light bulb, every new movie has a new director, and the only director I've seen that can hold par with the books is Chris Columbus. He is by far the best director the movies have seen, keeping in context with the books as close as one could, unlike the director in the third movie, it seems that all of the directors try to ""make it their own"" they like to take things that hold nothing in common with the books and try to incorporate them into the movies, you could take something completely irrelevant and they would try to use it with the movies. The director of The Prisoner of Azakaban tried to over-do a lot of the aspects of the movie, he let them walk around school with their uniforms untucked, when they have a dress code for a reason. I personally have never had a dress code when I was in school, but if you go to a boarding school where they make you wear a uniform you get in trouble for not wearing it, or if it's disheveled you have to fix it. One of the major problems I had with the Order of The Pheonix is the way they went about the film, they made it look like news paper clippings in between scenes. Completely uncalled for, seeing as you're not exactly reading a newspaper, why incorporate a newspaper into every other scene, or in fact when trying to speed up time. It doesn't make sense does it? The fight scenes are well done, I'll give them that much. But overall, I wouldn't go see it in the theaters again. Nothing too spectacular from this movie, just sub par acting on top of a sub par screen write. My advice is to wait for the DVD."
987,,uhhh,"This movie was terrible. What even happened in this? It's so boring, I had no idea what was going on. I've never read the books so it also made it hard to try to understand. I was waiting and waiting, thinking, wow is this for real? I couldn't believe how boring it was. I'm not a big harry potter fan but i liked the other ones. Well, the first four, then they started going downhill and this is the bottom. It was completely different than the others meaning, no interesting scenes and no interesting plot. There was one action scene that was super short and barely qualified for an action scene at the end, and then the movie is over. The are dragging these movies out way too much. It does not deserve a 7 rating. A 5 at best."
988,9,Better than the last,I enjoyed this much more than the last film. I have read the books and as ever I would have done things a bit differently but this is a good movie for anyone who is a Harry Potter fan.
989,9,"Not true to the book, but a VERY GOOD adaptation!","First of all, let me make something clear. My opinion of this movie is not that it was perfect, nor is it that it was absolutely dreadful. I should add that anyone with one of those opinions should really think the movie through, because I find it hard to believe it could be so extreme. "
990,6,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Watching young actors grow up during a very successful franchise is enjoyable to watch I think. Not only are they maturing physically, but you can tell at times that their acting is maturing as well. And although these kids have been doing it for six years, it seems as though they're still having fun with the characters they play. The same goes for the older generation of actors, but instead of growing up, they're the ""type-casting"" game. With two movies left to go and all three of the main children signed up to film them, will the older actors sign as well? Or will they decide to move onto something new before they're forever known as Severus Snape or Minerva McGonagall? Having said that, I believe the characters are pretty much the only interesting part about the film itself. The film moves slow at first, but picks up near the middle when all the pieces begin to come together. Unfortunately, the puzzle doesn't seem quite finished when all is said and done. However, it is only the fifth film in the series of seven and it begins to look more like the beginning of a trilogy than septilogy (yes, that's a series of seven), so pieces are left out to be explained in the next film and, hopefully, wrapped completely by the end of movie number seven."
991,6,a bit of a disappointment but still passable,"For a movie they could have done really well they didn't quite pull it off. i enjoyed it, but not as much as i have the other ones. as my dad said last night after we came back from watching it, it was different. okay things i did like. the Sirius and Harry scenes I loved those they were well done especially the one at the train station when he hands him the picture. any scene with Luna Lovegood, Evanna Lynch was simply perfect. them training in the Room of Requirement, though they should have just left the patronus thing the way it was. For me Neville Longbottom shone in this movie which I hoped he would. Bella, again Helena Bonham Carter was absolutely lovely even though all she did was cackle. I mean come on for such a superb character thats all they could do with her gee think they could have gotten an unknown actress to do that. I loved Gary Oldman one the best things about this movie and I will sorely miss him."
992,8,From a Middle-Aged Fan... Fun Movie!,"I was late to the franchise, not starting the books until just before Order of the Phoenix was released. But I've read them all more than once and am a huge fan of the books despite some old-fashioned ideas about what makes ""great literature."" I set those aside because Rowling has created a wonderfully heroic world that has, let's face it... magic."
993,8,A Film Worth Seeing (Contains Spoilers),"The fifth installment of Harry Potter is a fantastic piece of work that defines itself by breaking away from the first two movies in making a dim and almost depressing atmosphere. Accomplishing what 'The Goblet of Fire' attempts at, this film adds action to a fast paced movie that is almost sure to please any Harry Potter fan. Being a fan of the novels as well, I was displeased to see many things either completely neglected or details changed around. If you are a nitpicker of movies and love to point out the differences then I advise you to either wait until the DVD comes out or bite your tongue as this movie is filled with plot changes. The most obvious of which is the downfall in the relationship between Cho and Harry. The casting was, in my opinion, well placed and seeing Luna Lovegood and Dolores Umbridge played out on the big screen was well done. Much like the book, the viewer actually feels a seething loathing for Professor Umbridge and, while she may be odd, feel a sort of awkward love for Ms. Lovegood. Overall, I would rate this film an eight out of ten. While there were things I would have loved to have seen, I do feel that this film has lived up to its word in producing an overall sensation and getting fans like myself properly hyped up for the seventh and final"
994,,harry potter,"I to like movies but the book and the movies don't match.Movies is very funny and the players are very good.Harry Potter is very courageous so he doesn't afraid of Lord Voldemort.Lord Voldemort very strong but Lord Voldemort afraid of Albus Dumbledore.Albus Dumbledore saves to Harry Potter with Sirius Black .Harry loves Sirius Black because Sirius Black is godfather of Harry Potter.Sirius Black nickname is ""Padfoot"".He was best friend James Potter and Remus Lupin.He is brother of Regulus Black. Sirius Black didn't lethal but somebody to say lethal to him.Bellatrix Lestrange is cousin of Sirius Black.She to kill Sirius Black in Department of Mysteries.Harry Potter to chases Bellatrix Lestrange but Bellatrix to escape in Department of Mysteries."
995,6,If you have read the book you will be dis-appointed,In general I think the following were not covered correctly
996,4,Yet again Harry Potter doesn't live up to expectation on the big screen,"This is much like Azkaban, in that if you haven't read the book you will find this film enjoyable. However seeing as millions do read the book I can assure you disappointment lies within."
997,9,great movie!,"it certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. umbridge could have used some improvements, like perhaps imelda staunton (the actress who plays professor umbridge) wearing a fat suit that would have made her resemble a toad or at least look like she weighed 400 pounds, especially since the book described umbridge as looking like a toad. also very surprising that many of the lines in the movie were nearly exactly the same as in the book. it was also really wild when umbridge made the entire group known as ""dumbledore's army"" do her torturous detention, not to mention when the hallway with the shelves holding all the glass spheres came crumbling down."
998,6,"Long story ,not much content","Too me (never seen any part before ), itsvoong story telling, but much content actually so a bit disappointed ."
999,9,Good movie...but missed some key points I think,"OK. This may contain spoilers so if you have not read the book or seen the movie, stop reading."
1000,10,Did the professional critics see the same movie?,"Professional critics who previewed this film obviously did not see the same movie that my family and I saw! My children are now 14, 20 and 23 and have grown up reading the books. My whole family reads and loves the Harry Potter books and we enjoy the films, as well. Mostly, we love seeing the films together and then discussing them: what we liked or didn't like, what we would have done differently, etc. The five of us loved the fifth movie. We felt that it did a great job portraying the important points of the story while expressing the dark mood and growing tension. My 14 yr.old is the harshest critic of the films, and if she liked this one, then you know that it was good! These are no longer ""children's"" literature or films; the audience has matured along with the characters and the story line. If you haven't seen the film because of some mediocre reviews, do yourself a favor and go to see it! You'll be thrilled."
1001,9,good effort adapting it from the book,"Overall the movie is enjoyable. People who have never read the books may be a touch confused because some things aren't fully explained but that really doesn't take away much of the enjoyment of this movie. There are a few things I think should have been explained a bit better or in a slightly different way as they do have some bearings on future books (and most likely movies) so it will be interesting to see how they handle the exclusion of them in the next couple of movies. The child actors have certainly come a long way from the first movie and its really evident in the scenes with Harry and his friends wanting to train and fight against Voldermort. Some of the scenes may be a tad scary for younger crowds but there aren't very many of those. I'd have to say that its probably the best of the 5 so far just in terms of story, acting and overall enjoyability."
1002,8,A modern masterpiece,"I'll admit that I adore the Harry Potter books, but was never a huge fan of the movies. The first one was mediocre, the second good for only one reason (*cough* Sexy Jason Isaacs *cough*), and I LOATHED the third one. The movie that opened my eyes to its cinematic potential was the grandly staged fourth one. And now we have the fifth one: a modern masterpiece in itself."
1003,10,Best Harry Potter movie yet.,"This movie just blew me away! Now, first I would like to say that I haven't read all the books, I've seen the first film before reading the first book, and my reading stayed behind my harry potter theatrical viewings ever since. I liked all the Potter movies, especially the third one, but this one just so much outshines all of them its not even funny anymore. The first thing I would like to point out here is the phenomenal acting. The cast of older English actors is great, as always, but the real surprise are the young talents, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grind and Emma Watson have made so much progress since the last movie, I could not believe my eyes! Watson is definitely the weak link here, though still being very good. Grind is spot on, displaying the little less goofy than usual Ron, as for Daniel Radcliffe ... It seems like he has finally grown up as an actor. He displays so much depth to the Potter character, he definitely steals the show. And there is another thing that needs to be mentioned: the incredible directing. This movie is by far the best envisioned, scripted and directed of all the Potter movies, the direction is a fine, never before seen mix of genres, taking elements from the LOTR movies, horror, thriller, drama, teenage romance, comedy, with little intimate moments, like the scene between Harry, Ron and Hermione after Harry gets his first kiss that add immensely to the reality of the characters. This movie is a complete 10, see it even if you didn't like the the Potter movies of past. If you can appreciate a finely crafted masterpiece you WILL love this movie."
1004,6,"good movie, bad portrayal","I greatly enjoyed the third and fourth films, i believe both Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did a great job in portraying the characters both sympathetically and dramatically. however, i was very much disappointed with the fifth instalment. being a major Harry Potter fan I had waited on baited breath for it's release and was not met with the same magical feeling I had during the other movies or indeed the books. though the fifth book was not one of my favourites to begin with, with it being rather long and slow going at the beginning, the pace was also that of slow in the movie, though the acting was better than the other films, there didn't appear to be much of it. Cuarón had directed a film about the fulfilment of responsibility, about the trivialities of being a teenager and having to make important choices, Newell had taken a further step into the teenage world, creating love confusions between some of the characters that were perhaps not so obvious in the books, yet, Yates seems to have divulged his time into concentrating on different and very interesting camera shots and angles which work effectively but allow for a detachment to be made with the viewer. as a viewer i had little feelings towards any of the characters and noticed a lot of the time the use in time manipulation (flash backs etc) and the difference in both special effects and story line compared to previous films and the book itself. many things were inconsistent with the storyline which on many an occasion was very distracting and further hindered my enjoyment of the film. on the whole though worth watching, a true fan of the books and films may find this film a little far from its true potential."
1005,,"Thought it was GREAT, but got Disappointed!","OK, I thought Order of the Phoenix was really really great, but I was disappointed a bit. I mean they cut so much out of the movie and the beginning was all foggy. Luckily I had read the book twice already, so I understood everything fine. The whole Cho telling Umbridge thing was totally bogus and I hated that part. The way Harry reacted to Sirius dieing was a bit different then the book, but at first it happened just the right way. But at the Department of Mysteries it was pretty much just Neville and Harry because Ginny sprained her ankle, Hermione was like knocked unconscious, and Ron had those brain things all over him...what happened to Luna in the book, I forget. But honestly, I really really liked that movie!"
1006,8,"""Levicorpus!"" The Harry Potter films are revived.","I am of course a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and as usual I am often disappointed by the adaptations of the novels to the movie screen."
1007,5,A step down from the films that precede it.,"The introduction to the film was promising, but it begins to spiral out of control quickly thanks to the haphazard editing, lackluster cinematography, generic score, poor special effects and failure to draw the audience's sympathy during emotional moments, all making the fifth film seem like a high-budget, made-for-TV special."
1008,9,"Aggression, Depression, Suppression, Isolation - A Character-Driven Harry Potter Film","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" may have a few story faults more to do with the screen writing change than anything else, but it is nonetheless one of the better films of 2007. Comparatively, it is very well-directed and well-acted by the cast, even if the length makes cameos out of every actor except Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Umbridge. It does not deserve the nit-picking it has received by fans of the books and snooty critics who want to find some loose thread in the film series to unravel."
1009,7,I Completely Agree,"The movie was fine, and great in the battle in the ministry. But it was hollow, and didn't really suck me into it. I often found myself thinking about other things in the movie rather than being glued to the screen. I completely agree about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore as being too alert and angry rather than the crooked nose old man with a soft voice and twinkly eyes like the previous actor in the Philosipher's stone and the Chamber of Secrets. in which he captured it brilliantly. Also I didn't expect Sirius' death to be so brutal, it was really quick but it was brutal, I can't believe I didn't expect it to be brutal! I guess it's always more relaxed while you're reading the book, damn that J.K Rowling is good. It's as if (referring to the writer of the first comment) you read my mind."
1010,9,my least favorite book ends up being the best movie!,"okay first off, David Yates is a genius! to take a book like Order of the Phoenix and turn it into the unbelievable film that it is, might be the greatest thing i've ever seen. part of my dislike for the book is that almost half of it is in italics and is Harry just moping around and doubting himself. Yates took all that and managed to convey it on screen without being cheesy or lost."
1011,6,Not what I hoped,"Order of the Phoenix is the longest Harry Potter book thus far. So it's no surprise that they would have to cut a bit out of it to fit everything into a 2 hour 18 minute movie. However, while the part of me that was happy that this movie was only just over 2 hours because I was seeing it at midnight, the part of me that wanted the movie to be a little more true to the book was disappointed. The director and screenwriter consolidated quite a bit of material and left a couple of subplots out. I wasn't all that disappointed that we didn't get to see Herminone's efforts to knit scarfs and hats for the house elves, though I do remember on my recent rereading of the book that it would be fun to watch her magically knit a scarf. But some of the things that I felt were integral to the plot and feel of the book, were included but quickly, so as not to take up too much screen time."
1012,10,Although a little rushed... OOTP was Fantastic!!,"From the Dementors attacking the obnoxious Dudley and Harry, the irritating and unbearable Dolores Umbridge, and to the show-stopping duel between the two greatest wizards of the age... Order of the Pheonix was hands down the best Harry Potter book-adaptation so far! (SPOILERS) The film started off with a great introduction with the Dementor attack on the idiotic Dudley, and the aspiring wizard Harry. At the Ministry of Magic, the entire place was magnificently created... and definitely a way to introduce the upcoming jaw-dropping sets throughout the rest of the movie. Dolores Umbridge was perfectly portrayed... and hands-down stole the acting part of the entire film! At the Department of Mysteries... the entire scene was set up to the greatest detail.. and for sure made the myself completely engulfed in this movie! When Sirius' death came... I couldn't help to shed a tear! And then... it came! Once Dumbledore arrived to defend Harry by dueling Lord Voldemort I had goosebumps throughout the entire duel. Without a doubt... OOTP was perfectly adapted into the best adaptation so far! Although this movie is the best so far... some of the book was unfortunately left out... but that didn't stop me from wanting to watch it over and over again! I must say that Harry Potter has finally become a series that has conquered the entire world... child and all! This is the must see movie of the year! Drake"
1013,8,Wish it was more similar to the book,"I gave it an 8 because the movie itself is good.<br /><br />But if I wanted to rate it based on my expectation, I would give it a 2 maybe !<br /><br />When the movie came out years ago and I watched it for the first time I was SO disappointed.<br /><br />The order of pheonix is a very, very great book ! The details are absolutely beautiful and awesome !!<br /><br />I know that the movie can be a little different from the book. That difference is okay if it's like the differences between book3 and movie3.<br /><br />But the differences between book5 and moie5 are huuuge !! Some of them were really unnecessary !!<br /><br />I wish the movie was more similar to the book. Because it would be one of the most awesome ones ! The book is absolutely great with very beautiful details !<br /><br />Anyways, I rewatch HP movies a lot. I watch this one a lot too. Because even if it's different from the book, it still is nice to watch, and I do enjoy watching it no matter how many times i watch the hp movies.<br /><br />If you've never read the books before, the movie is very enjoyable.<br /><br />As a movie, it's a good one. As a movie based on the book ? disappointing. The cast, awesome.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the movie. I can't help but think about how great it would be if the movie was more similar to the book everytime I watch it.<br /><br />It's a Harry Potter movie anyway. As a very, very huge fan of HP, I still love and enjoy watching it."
1014,8,The worst in the series.,"I am a massive fan of the Potter series and my expectations for this film were very high. Yates has recreated many sequences from the book yet has neglected to provide us any of the genuinely emotional moments that define the series. The book (as i see it) is about family (Harry and Sirius, the Blacks, The Weasleys, The Longbottoms) and the terrifying prospect of something horrific happening to our loved ones. The danger is more real than ever, loved ones are getting hurt. This is defined in the book by the scene that really had to be in the film yet tragically wasn't... Mrs Weasley and the Boggart. We should care about the characters like they care for each other. Its difficult to care for a bunch of cameos, with screen time so short and characterisation near non existent, it feels like watching a sequence of events that you really don't care about. Harry's relationship with Sirius is underdeveloped and Sirius's murder wasn't the hero's death he deserved. This film is the worst in the series."
1015,1,"Horrible ,Awful, Bad.",This is worst Harry Potter movie out of all of them !
1016,10,Got the book nailed in one,"Took me several readings of the book 'OotP' to like it as much as the others, but the film is excellent: unnecessary detail is left out, and the story fits the time of a film beautifully. the new director has understood that the Harry Potter fans have grown up too, therefore the dark side can and does come out more. Characters more believable too. Apparently it took 2 years to write the screenplay - two years well spent. The final fight scene and different flying scenes gives us a welcome break from Quidditch. Brilliant casting of Dolores and Luna and Bella Lestrange - and excellent Grawp. Don't listen to / read from other people, go and see the film for yourself."
1017,7,"Two hours of constant ""fast forward""","I'm a big fan of fantasy books, and I really like when you make films of them. Though the problem with fantasy books is that they often are long (I mean like 900 pages, the Harry Potter books are relatively short). So when you try to make a film out of a fantasy book, you often ends up with something that feels like a resume of a film. I don't mean you shouldn't watch the films, they are often rather good, but you really should read the book before you see the film. All this apply to this film. It felt like they tried to put all the important events of the book into the film, but they hadn't time to more than tell us ""this happened"", and when the film reaches a point you recognize from the book, you get surprised by how little of the story that is left. I don't try to make you not seeing this film, I truly don't. But what I'm trying to say is that before you see any fantasy film that is based on a book (or any film at all that is based on a book), you really should read the book first. That sort of gives you a different perspective on the film, and you often understands a lot more of what happens. So see this film, but READ THE BOOK FIRST."
1018,8,It's impossible to create a real Harry Potter Movie,"Okay, some people will wonder why with the title of the comment comes a score of 8/10. It's simple. The movie, in its own rights has its merits. The problem lies with the way Rowling writes. She has a way of telling a story that grabs you, gets you involved in a very detailed and extensive plot, doesn't let you go till the end, and leaves you wanting more. It's impossible to capture that level of detail on film in a decent amount of running time."
1019,9,Great Movie! But some things are a bit annoying if you read the book...,"Loved the movie. Loved it. It's my favorite movie yet, though a little fast paced. I just have a few critizims."
1020,5,"O.K. as a movie, but not very true to the book.","After the extreme disappointment of the 4th HP movie (Goblet of Fire), I didn't really have any hopes for OOTP at all. When it came closer and closer though, I began to hear good things about it and was open-minded when I went into the theater...whaddaya know, I got disappointed AGAIN! Don't get me wrong, there were good things about the movie. I thought casting on Luna Lovegood was especially good. I loved how they made the Ministry look. I even liked the last battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore, even though it wasn't entirely faithful to the book."
1021,6,Lacks the freshness of Previous Potter films,"First off, the last two Harry Potter movies (Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire) were standouts in the series and although Order of the Phoenix is a very good looking film it has lost some of the spark of previous Potter adventures."
1022,6,Revise and Resubmit as any teacher would make one do..,"I can proudly say I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, AND I have to agree with the overall lukewarm review! The movie kind of blew!! BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS AS DIRECTOR, and make sure JKR oversees her precious storyline! I have read all of the books many times and own every movie and PS2 game out right now... The Order of the Phoenix movie was horribly disappointing: 1) Where was Rita Skeeter the reporter? She will have an important role later 2) Where was the development of Kreacher and/or Mad-Eye Moody stealing artifacts from the Black's house. Harry didn't even come across A LOCKET TOO HEAVY TO PICK UP. Does JKR not remember the whole Horcrux thing when overseeing a movie? Horcruxes are HUGE later..."
1023,1,Very Disappointed,"I really enjoyed the book, but upon rereading this book I discovered a quote Rowling wrote in the book regarding Lee Johnson a young black male with dreadlock the comment stated "" why would anyone like to look like they've got worms coming out of their head"" 291. This was very rude, and I'm disappointed as to why she would write such a rude thing I have no idea, but I will not reading anymore of her books."
1024,2,Worst of the series!,"Well what can I say? I had high hopes for this film, especially after the end of the Goblet of Fire! Voldemort finally appearing, the actors beginning to show signs of maturing (finally!) and a fantastic plot........but then I had to sit through 2 hours of Order of the Phoenix."
1025,7,Don't (re)read the book before,"This fifth installment of the Harry Potter series does not quite live up to the previous two. The longest book so far was condensed into the shortest movie. Although it does get the major story lines across, many liberties have been taken with the details. I re-read the book just before seeing the movie, and perhaps would not have noticed all these 'creative liberties', if I hadn't. Some details essential to the plot have just been scratched on the surface, and quite a bit was changed."
1026,7,"Apart from the books, pretty good.","I went to see Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix opening night at midnight. I had had a very tiring day and was falling asleep in my seat waiting for the movie to begin. I had recently reread the books and was ready for a book-movie comparison. Miraculously I managed to keep very much awake during the whole of the movie. At the end, I was disappointed to say that many parts of the plot had changed, and was not happy with the outcome. I once again watched the movie later in the week, and tried to look at it from a movie point of view. Overall the directing and cinematography is quite good and some of the art directing is great. Acting wavered from character to character, but once again it is hard to star in a movie where people are just waiting to criticize you. I thought Gary Oldman did a great job, and Umbridge as well. My final thought: it was pretty good."
1027,10,"Excellent, Best one YET!","David Yates, director, has done one of the best jobs on a Harry Potter movie yet. Alfonzo Curron, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban did the best job in my eyes until Order of the Pheonix. They cut out much that was in the book but they made up for all that by adding new clips that made the movie even better. Yates will be directing the Half- Blood Prince, the 6th book in the amazing series by J. K. Rowling and i am really looking forward to it. ANYONE WHO LIKES HARRY POTTER MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! The movie goes by quick but it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. It is packed with action, intensity and surprises. Even though they cut out much from the book, i enjoyed it, unlike my brother who disagrees and finds the movie terrible just because they cut too much out, they still leave the main parts of the book in the movie. Who ever seen this movie will agree with me that Helena Bonham Carter plays Bellatrix Lastrange perfectly and without any problem. MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!"
1028,10,In JKR's own words: Outstanding and Exceeding Expectations,"To those of u who have read the book and already know how great it was and also depressing, the movie highlights all its aspects and unlike the 4th movie which included details that didn't exist in the book and was awfully annoying, the 5th movie does contain details like so but it really fits into the plot and actually makes it better... The acting itself has improved beyond measures, especially Dan, it shows a lot in his expressions and his out-bursts, they also act older and finally can show that the movie is no longer in the shadow of the kids section (no offence to the young ones here), thanks to David Yates whose efforts are worldwide appreciated by the HP fans as he is the first to make it seem more like an adult movie."
1029,10,A Huge Disappointment For a Big Fan Like ME!,"i was waiting so long for this movie, i watched it today and i have gotta say, IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME. I made so many things in my head while i was reading the book but when i watched movie,i figured out that, the director had changed whole script! for example: it wasn't cho who betrayed dumbledore's army,it was cho's friend, and during the final battle between voldemort and dumbledore, the statues in the pool had to come alive and protect harry from battle. and where was dobby!? it should have been the one who finds the secret room for the army. and we haven't heard any screams from Sirius black's mother in the house. in the book there was no voldemort part in the train station, but in the movie he was there in black suit! what i am trying to explain is book was great and wonderful but the movie is very very different from book and for the fans,disappointing! i wished the director hadn't changed the script,it is so sad."
1030,6,very good but a heck left out,"i had already read reviews and stuff before i went and saw this movie so i sort of knew what i would be getting but i never thought that they would leave so much out of the movie. like; Ron and Hermione becoming prefects, the Wesley's shop, dobby and the kitchens, Ron and quiditch, Ginny and quiditch, they missed a lot out of snapes memory with James, dumboldors speech with harry at the end of the movie, st mongos and lost more. although saying all of this the bits that they did put in the movie were really good. Luna was fantastic she was so much like her character in the book. the end battle scene was cool i like all the fighting. the DA was OK and the theresals were pretty cool. umbridge was really funny it was good that they made her really mean still."
1031,6,"Fans will be sadly disappointed at the numerous inaccuracies, as will future readers, seeking to avoid reading the entire series.","While it doesn't achieve the accuracy that I have come to expect from the first three movies, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix does convey most of the book. Inaccuracies abound, and the movie fails to mention key points in the plot, such as Dumbledore referring to the chamber in which Sirius dies as the ""Death Chamber"", and Sirius giving Harry the mirror (which may not matter)."
1032,8,I Loved It,"Don't listen to all those other people--watch this movie!! Overall, I loved it. I am not a huge fan of the previous movies, and the books, (besides #3), but i loved this movie. Ties for my favorite with Prisoner of Azkaban. The other movies and books I really can't stand all that much."
1033,2,"It is an awful movie, not worth renting, and I am a fan.","The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the Death Eaters new masks looked cool, but that isn't anything worth going to see it for. I am a total fan, I know that the movies and books differ greatly, but that never bothered me before. This movie was not only the worst of the series, but in my opinion, one of the most awful movies that I've ever seen. I know that Yates had a lot of book to compact into a movie script, but he seemed to sacrifice the story telling to generate motivational sounding sound clips. I know many other fans of Harry (both the books and the movies) that have said that ""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the hardest book to read, but the final fight scene in the Ministry was worth the wait. I loved the book and the fight at the end and was not expecting the movie to include all the details of the book, but, and i am sorry, it really sucked. I sat through two hours of choppy cuts and cheesy film making still amped about the final scene. It was a real disappointment, he gave it little attention and when Sirius died (which is important) it was so cheesy and quick. I feel sorry for the people who base their whole idea of Harry Potter from the movies,I believe they will not go back again, and if Yates directs again neither will I."
1034,9,Best movie yet,"Considering the fact that the book is the worst of the lot being too long and rambling, the film is excellently adapted ! It didn't follow the book too closely like the first two, so there were quite some surprises for those who know the book by heart. It didn't seem rushed like the fourth film. The pace was just right. Neither did it feel too far out like the third film. The best thing about this Potter film is that it stands well on its own without the book. Both the people who have read it and those who haven't will enjoy this movie. Acting and cinematography was top-notch. Soundtrack was great. The climax was very well done. By the way, Filch has maximum screen-time here compared to the other four ! Adapting a 700+ page book to a highly satisfying 153 minute film is no mean feat."
1035,10,The best of the Potter movies yet!!,Just a warning for those who haven't read the book and plan on seeing the movie: this contains spoilers!! 
1036,9,"Beautiful Film, but Soundtrack Found Lacking","I would like to reiterate every single word that Kingtrio9 said in her review. Best acting yet. The movies, like the books, grow and mature as their characters do. Single complaint--the soundtrack. Nicholas Hooper fails to provide much of a canvas for the movie to play out on. Sometimes the moments of silence are fitting and dramatic, but they happen too often. The Harry Potter theme, John William's ""Hedwig's Theme"" is played only 2 or 3 times in the movie and it is never the original--it is a Hooper adaption. Most of the background music sounds like mischievous tinkering. It doesn't do justice to any Harry Potter movie, but ESPECIALLY one as serious as this."
1037,10,The book and the movies: Worlds Apart,"The only way to really enjoy a Harry Potter movie is forgetting everything about the book, 'cause even if they are based on them, no one will ever be able to be completely faithful to the book, and so it happens with OOTP, in my personal opinion is the best one yet, but that is my opinion it's up to you if you like or no. Of course it could have been better, for it is very short, but I do think it has the essence of book 5, which is quite hard when you have to fit 800 pages into a 2 and a half hour movie. most of the complains are about the lack of details, but it may be these details weren't as necessary as we thought or whatever the reason is; these movies are movies and we have to enjoy them as such, for we would never be completely satisfied with it as an adaptation of the book."
1038,6,Not the best,"I think many will agree that the fifth film adaptation of Rowling's magnificent book turned out noticeably worse than the previous ones. Of course, all these parts keep the level, but after the departure of Chris Columbus, the level of film adaptations dropped sharply, and only ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" came to fame. The second reason for the failure of the picture was the absence of Stephen Close as a screenwriter, and this part was the only one in which he did not take part."
1039,5,"Amazing performances, but just not up to par.","I thought the actors outdid themselves in this installment of the Harry Potter series. Daniel Radcliffe was amazing and I can't wait until the next two movies. The screenplay was just not good and the directing very ""in the box."" The beginning of the movie was trying to be a suspense flick with jump outs and mysterious setups and then it changes into your basic follow the plot film with minimal character development. So much could have been done with this material (and yes, I realize there was nearly 900 pages of source material) and sadly, I left the theater disappointed...and I wasn't alone in that feeling. I really hope the producers and J.K. Rowling can salvage the series and bring back the magic of Stone and Chamber."
1040,3,Really Poor Film,"Its true to state that this film is absolutely nothing like the book. It contains around 35% of the events that actually happen so prepare for disappointment - but thats not the reason why this film fails on so many levels. Initially, lets start with some positives. Michael Gambon does an excellent job of playing Dumbledore, a complete reversal to his dreadful portrayal in the Goblet of Fire. The special effects are excellent (and probably save this film from being completely unwatchable)and errrr... thats about it. The characters Ron and Hermione barely have any dialogue in this instalment, a shame since it is usually their performances that carry the talentless and wooden actor Daniel Radcliffe through the previous films. It is true that Daniel Radcliffe looks the part but his adaptation of Harry is awful. Alan Rickman is solid in his portrayal of Snape but his brief cameo in the film only highlights the fact that all the characters that Harry Potter fans have grown to love and hate barely appear at all. I envisage that in the near future that these films will be re made with the help of better script writers, indeed, the previous lord of the rings films, before Peter Jackson produced the trilogy, were awful and thus I conclude that that this again will happen. Very Poor, Very Dull. Harry Potter 5 Avada Kedavra!!!"
1041,8,Brilliant,"This movie is great and not for the faint of heart! By far, it was the most thrilling and adult film of the series and had many surprising moments and stunning visual effects. The movie was pretty loyal to the book, considering the nearly 900 page adaption, though character development was clearly lacking in the script as so much was cut out. If you are a fan of Chris Columbus' sappy kiddy style films you probably will not enjoy this film much. However if you like POA and GOF, this film will be highly entertaining."
1042,10,Not a bad movie.,"That movie was awesome. Most people will say that the movie was the weakest in the series, but don't be fooled. The introduction of Evanna Lynch (Luna ""Loony"" Lovegood), and Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks) have got to make it the best cast ever. Luna was actually different than what most people saw from the book. I expected someone more like Professor Sybil Trelawny, instead they cast someone as good looking as Evanna, (anyone have her number?) who filled the space in rather well. Tonks is not seen much in the movie, but i liked her the moment I saw her. The part where she gets mad at Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody has gotta be awesome. As she is not seen much in the actual movie, I am sure the DVD version will have a couple of cut scenes involving her. As for Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) dying, heartbreaking. The scene where Harryand Sirius are looking at the Black Family Tree, when Sirius says ""When this is all over, we'll be a proper family."" Those who have read the book, and know what's coming want to cry before he even dies. Michael Gambon, Albus Dumbledore redeems himself with an excellent performance, showing us that his character is not dead, yet. Overall a good movie, definitely one worth seeing."
1043,9,"Good plot line, misses many points...","Although this movie had awesome special effects and acting, I felt that it left you hanging in some places. For example, when the six arrive at the ministry, you don't really know how they got in there because of the jump between scenes. Also, when seeing Percy standing next to the Minister, I felt that the audience deserved an explanation for why he was there. Along with that no one really know what the veil is that Sirius goes through, it just kind of appears. The plot jumped around a lot in this movie and it did confuse people who didn't read the book. I also felt that there could have been more about Hagrid and the classes that the students were in. The only class that was shown was Defence Against the Dark Arts. Also, there was no explanation of why the Weasley twins had their Skiving Snackboxes and what they were planing to do with them."
1044,8,Good as a movie,"I won't lie. Lots of stuff was cut out or changed, and some new was put in. If the book's Dolores Umbridge was a monster, she's a pussycat compared to the one in the movie. And I'll admit, I enjoyed the book a lot more than the movie. But, I also enjoyed this movie immensely. Even if they DID cut out the most moving scene in the book-the last scene with Harry and Dumbledore."
1045,8,Harry turns to Dirty Harry,"First of all let me say that I am not a big fan of harry potter, and I only went to see the movies when they come out. And this time wasn't necessarily different, the plot is getting darker, also the actors are getting more advanced. I didn't help to notice that harry is turning more and more aggressive the movies pass, also the actresess especially Emma Watson, Katie Leung, Bonnie Wright are getting hotter also the new girl Evanna Lynch seems to have a rare beauty. the action gets more intense, also the emotions of the characters (spoiler) the battle between Dumbuldore and Amon Goeth aka Ralph Fiennes aka Voldemort gives a battle I only thought I seen in the lord of the ring trilology. to end David Yates for me was a bad choice to be a director. the great Alfonso Cuaron will have made the best movie since the prisoner of Azkaban in my opinion."
1046,1,Satan AT WORK!!!,"I cannot believe that people would see a movie about satanic witchcraft. The lord says in Deuteronomy 18:10-11 ""Let no one be found among you... who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or cast spells, or who is a medium or spiritist."" The BIBLE itself condemns witchcraft. THIS IS THE WORD OF GOD telling us to condemn witchcraft, the most evil of sins. Yet, JK Rowling twists the minds of children into believing that magic and sorcery are wonderful things by portraying young wizards and witches having fun and using spells. By reading these books and watching these movies you are letting Satan and his evil spirits into your soul. Some don't even know that they are trapped by his spell. These lost souls need to pray to the lord Jesus almighty that they will be saved and granted entrance into heaven. If you continue watching and reading these Satanic novels you are guaranteed suffering in eternal hellfire."
1047,2,One the the worst films,"apart from the camera, there was NOTHING,absolutely nothing in the movie. I should accept that the story was good but the screenplay was HORRIBLE to the core. I don't know how you people can give 8.1/10 for this movie...please don mistake me but I'm a big fan of harry potter series myself but i guess i got a bit too disappointed. some of the good points about the movie were cinematography and that's about it. the dialogues were not up to the mark as well. I am being really harsh on all of them regarding this part in particular. I wish to see them put a better show next time. Last of all, I don't understand one point.. the director has the story which is the preliminary and the screenplay is all that needs. people have done a awful job with this novel. i feel sorry for Rowling for messing up her work."
1048,5,simply not a good movie,"This movie is better than the first three, but then again that isn't saying much (the 4th wasn't as bad). The first three often threw out story, good dialog and character development and put in a great heap of ""Wow that bus just shrunk and fit between the other two buses!"" or ""That skull has a Jamaican accent, isn't he just the wackiest thing you've ever seen?"" which I found very annoying and lazy. It was like the director thought he could just get by on the ""isn't that wacky"" mood. Well, now we have a different director. This must change right? In some ways that thought would be correct, as this movie has a much darker mood than the rest. However the director still seems to go back to that annoying habit of instead of showing us a character is ""wacky"" through good writing, he zooms in on a characters face way too far. Another thing about the characters which annoyed me was that nearly all, except for the 3 main characters and a select few of the secondary characters, were WAY overplayed by the actors. For example: the Dursley's. If you have seen the previous movies, you know what i am talking about. What i will give to this is that it is a step in the right direction. As I said earlier, it is a lot darker than the previous films. Hopefully we can have at some point a Harry Potter that is serious and relies on good dialog and character development instead of the ""Isn't the magical world just wacky?"" thing that is going on now"
1049,6,A Disappointment.,"I found the fifth movie to be a rather disappointment to watch. The screenplay, as highly predicted, well that is, from myself (due to the change in the screenwriter) is VERY inconsistent with the other movies. The new style of story-telling Harry Potter's journeys are very different. This particular film did not display the magic as I anticipated. I was actually quite bored in the theater for many parts of the film. There were too many silent moments and way too much dialog."
1050,7,It was an OK movie,I saw the movie last night There could have been better screen writing and editing the plot and focus could have been tighter in spots while holding true to the book. I read the book so I was a little down but not so much because I still have my books.
1051,7,Not as faithful to the book as it could have been.,"Naturally the film has strong points and weak points. After watching the movie twice, I hold the belief the film could have benefited from an extra hour of scenes."
1052,6,Not good at all...,"Well, what can i say? I'm not a huge fan of the franchise and haven't read a word of the books. This film was ultimately disappointing due to one major flaw. THE DIRECTOR! David Yates, of Merseyside. He?s apparently not really up to the job of handling(read more)a several million dollar budget. I haven't seen any of his other work but then i don't usually watch 'The Bill'. Bring back Chris Columbus, a much more capable director. Although a change of screenwriter probably didn't help things much either. The big effects scenes were marred by the director's insistence to cut away from the glorious special effects work at every opportunity! I can't understand his thinking, if you have huge budget special effects sequences why limit their time on screen? Shining through this incompetence are superb performances from Imelda Staunton as a delightfully evil and vicious Dolores Umbridge, and the usual impeccable stability from Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon and Gary Oldman along with a sadly under used Ralph Fiennes. The score was a bit over the top and didn't do enough to improve the depth and atmosphere of any scene. Only seeming to accentuate the awful direction. However, the sound design was superb; never overdone and perfectly judged. All in all not a good film at all. Unfortunately, I feel the producers are giving in to the needs of it's increasing adult audience (different covers for the books, WTF?) It should have been left where it was; an excellent children's fantasy adventure in the best traditions of British literature that adults can secretly enjoy."
1053,8,Movie Was way better than 4th,"Well there was very few things bad to say about this movie. I would rather see a summary of the movie then, lets add this because it would be cooler than what was in the book. The Dragon Scene in the 4th movie was a waist of time and money. Now there are going to be fans of the movies turning to the fourth book going where is the Dragon fight with harry? As for the 5th movie great job on keeping to the plot but they need to remember they didn't start the series so they Should not have change the Demntors look. They look like flying death eaters. They should have stayed with how the originals look from the 3rd film.I wish they would have spent more time on the department of mysteries like all the rooms they went through they could have done each room briefly. I wish the would have done the magical hospital and had lock hart there too."
1054,8,My favorite book---my favorite movie,**contains spoilers**
1055,6,Not Good...,"First i must say i am huge Harry Potter fan. I read books 4 times, all of them. Yes, i know i'm out of my mind."
1056,8,One of the better HP films so far...,"Despite speeding through the plot and excluding several things from the book, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is probably one of the better Harry Potter films I have seen so far. The movie also manages to show the emotions emitted by characters in the book, such as frustrations towards Umbridge. The acting of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was amazing, I could really feel that her character had been brought to life."
1057,8,The most deftly handled and exciting one yet.,"There's a moment in the latest Potter instalment that makes you feel really old. It's a flashback from the very first film of a minuscule, bowl-haired Daniel Radcliffe staring into a mirror. It's hard to imagine that charming young moppet strutting around a Westend stage in the buff or flicking condoms at Diana Rigg on BBC comedy Extras. It's enough to make you say with a sigh: ""my hasn't he grown?"" Yes it seems hardly yesterday that Warner Bros.' fantasy franchise first obliterated box office records with Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, way back in 2001. Six years, five films and millions of dollars later Warner Bros.' star pupil is still on a roll, but things have changed slightly. Clearly it's true what they say, time flies when you're having fun. "
1058,5,"This isn't a ""Movie"".....",it's a collection of out-take scenes from the book that are lumped together to fill the run time.
1059,9,Best one to date,"I have always enjoyed the movie series and I think that this one is by far the best I've seen. The director has done a tremendously job with the title, and while it has it's failing (there are a few small things that should have been added but weren't) the movie it self is incredible."
1060,6,surprisingly disappointing,"To begin with, Order of the Pheonix has been my favorite book so far. As i was reading it all I could do was imagine how awesome it was going to be on the screen! The whole plot is amazing, and exciting, perfect for a film version it seemed. Granted there would be much cut out, as it has been the longest book in the series so far, I was still looking forward to a crazy film. Needless to say I went into my screening of Harppy Potter at 4 o'clock the day after it came out and I was a little taken back. I thought over all it was pretty cool but so much was removed, parts that could and should have been added in if they just spent a little more time with it. The film was very rushed, the cuts between a few different scenes are so dramatic i wasn't sure if it really just happened or not. My boyfriend, who has not yet read the book, was unsure if a certain major incident near the end of the film even happened or not because of how abrupt the scene ended! And while I'm on the subject, the last scene could have been so INCREDIBLE! The last few chapters of the book are some of the most intense pages in all of the Harry Potter books combined, and it took the film about 5 minutes to show us. It would have been worth it all, had they taken like 30 extra minutes and actually elaborated the last scenes to what they needed to be. Basically, there were major plot holes- to a fan of the book anyway, pretty good acting- about as same as usual, although I felt like I didn't see Ron or Hermione much, but, that was due to how short the scenes were in order to pack the movie into just a few minutes over 2 hours. All and all, I did enjoy the film, I just think it was just too rushed and packed together to really do the book justice. They should have done a ""Kill Bill"" type movie, split it into two parts and released them separately. Maybe I need to go alert David Yates and let this little secret out, if the final book is going to be as big and intense as I hope. I know people are going to expect something crazy from that. Anyway, Let's just hope David Yates brings it next time, because he's in it for the long road and so am I."
1061,8,New Director to watch,"I'm one of those people who fall in and out of th fandom. I write a little fic, I've read the books, I've a Slytherin Quidditch costume...so fan, not really fanatic."
1062,,The Perfect Adaptation for the Ultimate Harry Potter Fan,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is much different than its predecessors, in that the true message of the books plays a significant role in this particular movie. The Harry Potter book series is about tolerance, friendship, and love, and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg has done a far better job than Steve Kloves has ever done in incorporating this message into the movie."
1063,10,Spoilers within...tread carefully...Great movie...,"From my perspective, this was the best movie...most true to the book (surprising with all the cuts that were needed) since the first one. Many lines were directly from the text, and that was fantastic. Being the first showing, the theater was fairly rowdy and a well timed audience line of ""you suck Dolores"" got a huge laugh and applause. Speaking of, she was pretty good...didn't look the part so much but really played it up. They were lose with the decrees, but her attitude really hit the mark (as well as her little cough). Could have been a bit more to her, but that was I think a result of cutting some of the things that made her evil in the book (banning harry for life from quidditch) and not on her portrayal of the character."
1064,6,Poorest of all the Harry Potter films,"The actors did a fantastic job and it was overall an enjoyable film, however...I gave the others in this series a 10. This one rates a 4 because it was terribly adapted. "
1065,9,"Great acting, special effects, and movie in general.","With Imelda Staunton playing Dolores Umbridge, this movie really gets to you quick. Staunton's acting is superb, and almost Acedemy Award material. This movie is very fast paced and action packed, the special effects are intense, and the scenery is just beautiful."
1066,7,Err...No.,"I thought this was a good, solid movie. gotta agree that they've got progressively better, but thats not necessarily because of the acting. Let's face it, out of the 3 main characters: Ron, Hermione and Harry, only Ron can act. The other two are shockingly bad. Each film takes about 8/9 months to film, and they've done 5 of them. That's FIVE. How long does it take to get into character? Does Daniel Radcliffe have to look indecisive the WHOLE time; does Emma Thomson/Watson (can't quite remember) HAVE to look as if her brain is hurting ALL the time. It would be nice to have some sort of a semblance of reality from these two actors, mind you i thought Radcliffe acted well when he was being possessed by Ole' Voldy. Older actors were good, especially liked the choice for Bellatrix. But honestly. You could go into any theater and probably pick out better actors that Harry and Emma. In fact, try any school."
1067,6,*le sigh*,"Alright I'm not going to rant and rave as I feel I should, nor will I take the time to point out all the stuff this film left-out/ruined."
1068,9,An incredible adaptation of the book!,I have only been home for about ten minutes and already had the urge to write a review for this film...that's how amazing it is.
1069,7,Potter or Plotter?,"First, let us look at the good. The movie had some unique aspects. The use of The Daily Prophet in the spinning newspaper reminiscent of earlier film making is really cool. The final action scene is extremely well done. I believe that Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe give much improved performances along with other members of the supporting cast. When I say Rupert Grint's performance is improved, I mean that I found him completely believable as the best friend. Emma Watson had a few good moments and well delivered lines, but I think she is still lagging behind the others. Editing was very well done and just when the movie started to talk too much, it would cut. Special Effects gets an A+. Basically, as a movie this one stands in the ranks of the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and even The Sorcerers Stone (which I appreciate for capturing the book very well and really starting the movies off on a good foot)."
1070,3,Poor Movie,"People say that although parts of the book were missed out, the film was still good. WRONG! The film lacked important parts of the book which was bad. But the directing was appalling (I can't believe they have David Yates doing the next film, he was terrible) The acting was completely wooden (except for Imelda Stauton, who was too good and made me hate her and want to turn it off when she was on screen) and the whole thing just lacked energy completely. Poor film in a poor series of films that have done the books no justice at all. Th eonly good one being Prisoner of Azkaban. This was truly appalling film, even the CGI was pretty poor."
1071,6,An exercise in disappointment,"Being a moderate fan of the series of books, I approached this movie with reserved hopes and was still disappointed with the final product. In a movie with so much potential, some bad directorial decision coupled with some bad acting sink this film from the very start."
1072,5,Argh. Bloody 'ELL!,"Alright so i've been reading a lot of peoples thoughts on this movie and there is much i would like to say. There were only two things like i really really enjoyed while watching this film. I was very entertained by the final fight scene. The spells were pretty wicked and it was pretty well done..though a little short if u include the whole Department of Mysteries. I also enjoyed the acting for the worst reason. i was laughing so hard at the awkward moments, awful dialogue, and unbelievable acting that it actually made them enjoyable. Wow. i have lots of inside jokes now. (examples: the scene where Ron and Hermione have their little duel & just the awkward moments with Neville)"
1073,9,Best Potter flick yet - an improvement on the novel!,"It takes something special to condense an excellent 800+ page novel into an even better, sub-three hour movie - and Order of the Phoenix is something very special indeed. The best Potter film so far, this has class acting (as many have already noted, the fresh casting of Staunton, Bonham Carter and Lynch is spot-on), plenty of action and top-drawer special effects, all carrying a complex and thoughtful story. As much about teen angst and coming-of-age as a critique of the education system, it has both intellectual depth alongside its exciting, fast-paced plot. As a long time fan of all things Potter - see you at the midnight launch of Deathly Hallows, too, folks! - I'm delighted to say that this movie has topped them all. Some of the characters, like Kreacher and Bellatrix, seem to have only the bare minimum of screen time - but you have to put this into the context of an entire series of films. You can't expect everything to tie up and make sense by the time the credits roll on this one!"
1074,10,My Order of the Phoenix comments,"First of all, I have to agree wholeheartedly with the previous person and would like to add some more."
1075,,"Highly Entertaining - After All, Isn't That The Point? :-P","Well, I saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix last night. There were things I liked and things I didn't, just as with all the other movies. I felt the beginning was a bit rushed, more so than the rest of the film, but that's understandable since the book is so massive. It can't have been easy to convert from book to script.They did get in most of what was necessary and throughout the film managed to get across Harry's frustration at Dumbledore's ignoring him without really resorting to verbal explanation (if that makes sense...)."
1076,4,Not acceptable,"Well, after looking forward to this movie and waiting until it has been out a few days, we finally went to see it. Well, my advise, don't. It felt like we had just seen another trailer. I sincerely believe that you can't help being disappointed. It was like peeking through a window and seeing only small pieces of everything going on, never really getting the whole picture. "
1077,7,Don't believe the fan hype,"This movie is a solid 7 out of ten. The acting was good. The plot was extremely choppy and hard to follow. The visuals were mostly great, but there were a couple of terrible CGI creations. There is some character development and decent amounts of action, but this isn't an ""edge of your seat"" experience. I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. I think they're well told and a lot of fun. That said, most fans I know who have seen this movie were like ""It's the best movie of the century"" or ""I hate that they didn't include ___________, it ruined the entire movie."" They are both wrong. The fanboys and fangirls are eschewing it or lapping it up based on their feelings love of the books. This is a decent summer movie. I'm glad I didn't que up to see it on some midnight show, because it isn't worth a ton of money or a large time investment. It is a pleasant diversion if you have a block of free time and feel like going to the movies. That said, if you haven't seen Ratatouille or Transformers, I'd recommend those first as they have better visuals, better acting and a much more realized plot than this. Just my opinion, but that's about how I see it."
1078,7,"Phoenix delivers in a way, but really, stick to the book or you'll be disappointed",This movie had many holes in it and there wasn't really that touch from the books that made it feel magical like it had when I first read it.
1079,6,Mixed Feelings,"The fifth Harry Potter book was extremely long and had many things best explained in words than by film. Therefore, it is understandable that it was so cut up and that there were many things changed in the movie adaptation. Personally, I find that a lot of my favorite scenes and aspects of the book were cut from the film that almost ruined it for me. I was eager to see more of Bellatrix Lestrange because she's just such an evil witch, but she really only appeared for five minutes and had very little lines. I also would have liked to see the conversation Harry has with Nearly Headless Nick about ghosts after Sirius dies because I found that Harry's sudden spark of hope was a very emotional part, especially when that spark was extinguished. It also wouldn't have hurt to have some of the Quidditch parts included, but I do admit that they weren't even slightly important to the story. I would have also been nice to see the meeting with the giants (it might have been just a little violent though...) And something very important that was never mentioned (if my memory is correct) in the movie was the reason why Harry has to always stay at Privet Drive every summer with his Aunt Petunia."
1080,2,Grass is greener in the theater next door,"Went to the movies yesterday and because nothing else on the bill looked palatable I took a chance and saw the new HP film. As an outsider to the series of Harry Potter books, haven't read them, I was only vaguely familiar with the characters and nature of the series. So I watched the movie with bated anticipation as one would for a new release not based on a book. Impression: where's the plot? Where's are the lives in peril if the antagonist isn't thwarted? Who's crisis was it? Obviously, by HP constipated expressions he was on the throes of disaster. But what about the others? His two partners - as charming as they were - followed HP around like lapdogs as he aimlessly ( to me at least) dealt with a confusion of forces. The scenery and costumes and make-up and music etc were superb!! The actors were no doubt skilled in their trade but seemed wooden and detached from the whole project. I mean, I felt no bonding between any characters. So many scenes seemed lifted from other famous movies; the red phone booth from Dr Who, Sirius' little Gollum-like guy, etc. I won't say it wasn't creative but the devices were not gripping and most I had seen used before, like old ideas tossed in a hat and pulled out at random. Don't want to blast this movie, nor do I want to believe that the books are just a cliché but all I know is that for over two hours I was wondering if I should've gone to see another movie at the multiplex."
1081,6,"Good wiz-bang action, but short on chemistry","I commend the director, David Yates, for managing to somehow cram in the salient points from a 900+ page book into a two hour and fifteen minute movie. However, like the previous director of the GOF flick, he also severely underdeveloped several of the supporting characters - and totally butchered the much-ballyhooed budding romance between Harry and Cho. Katie Leung had one? two? lines in GOF. She had about the same amount of dialogue in this movie (shooting the occasional goo-goo eyes at Harry does NOT count!)"
1082,9,Stop whining about specific details,"I'm so sick of reading reviews from stupid 15 year old girls pi**ed off their favorite part of the book was cut in the movie. Its a MOVIE not a biopic of the story. To satisfy some of these fans it would take a three part series carefully and dutifully chronicling Harry's every move and line from the book. Better yet how about a 8 hour movie of J.K. Rowling simply reading the book using crazy lighting effects and gesticulating wildly during the more dramatic scenes? 1st off, grow up, these movies aren't made to satiate your simple little desires but rather to capture the ARCHETYPES of the stories and characters. In OTTP, my least favorite novel but now most favorite movie, this was done PERFECTLY. You can see the straining relationships between Harry and his friends and his sense of abandonment from Dumbeldore and Sirius. We witness his struggle with being completely alone and eventually his determination to accept those who will never abandon him. This entire progression has taken the Harry Potter franchise so close to the realms of great cinema that i wonder if those only thinking Harry Potter was about whimsy and magic were missing the point entirely. The Harry Potter film franchise as a whole can only claim to brush greatness twice within its tenure. This with the Prizoner of Azkaban, by far the best adaption by a REAL director (Cuacaron) and now here under the hand of Yates. Yes much is cut and curbed for consistency but overall the story is thinned to only the best and most important material. If you want the harry potter experience, read the book and never watch the movies for you will be impossibly dissatisfied by the amount of detail excluded for sake of plausible running times, however, if you're not a whiner and appreciate the films as a separate entity you will be greatly satisfied by the job done in OOTP. The only complaints i will make is the lack of the brilliant John Williams yet again as composer. I pray to whatever religious entity might exist that he will have a change of heart and WB will be able to goad him back to the musical helm. Otherwise we will have to suffer through lack luster and no offense, British, composers. Also with as many truly incredible acting talents on display for the Harry Potter movies, why did they cast such a miss for Tonks? She looked nothing like the books description and had such an unnecessary role in the movie. Every time she was on screen i was just asking myself...why? Never the less i am eagerly awaiting Half Blood Prince and am glad they have given Yates the job in order to add some consistency to the bi-polar and truly unfortunate directing of the past (Columbus? Dear God who let this happen?). This series is on the right track and not even whiny detailers can derail it."
1083,9,"details, details, details","first of all i would like to say that some people who consider the harry potter series the ""bible"" will be disappointed in the film. i have read all the books and this book is just to long and too complex of a story to condense into a film so don't go into the movie looking for details like tonks' hair being correct or the subtle side plots. they took a great book, over 800 pages, and condensed it into a little over a 2 hour movie... what do you expect? secondly, i would like to say that i really enjoyed this movie. i felt like they gave the movie the feel the book had. dolores umbridge (imelda staunton) and luna lovegood (evanna lynch) were absolutely perfect and brought the characters to life. also harry potter (daniel radcliffe) definitely portrayed the characters feelings and anger throughout the entire movie. i felt like the movie stayed true to the main plot of the book though they had to tweak a lot of details to condense it and make it followable by a person who hasn't read the book."
1084,6,Disappointed,"I realize that most of what I'm going to say has already been said in other comments, but I feel strongly enough about this that I wanted to put in my two cents worth."
1085,6,Too rushed.... good fun but not memorable.... does not live up to the book,"The movie seemed rushed... too many details left out..... not too many important ones but still.... as someone who has read the book, I felt a little cheated as it seemed like too apparent an attempt to just make money riding on the Pottermania. A lot is left to assumption in the movie. THE CHARACTERS WERE TOO UNDER-DEVELOPED. Hell, Hermione and Ron looked like side-kicks."
1086,4,"A average film, but a poor adaption...","Lets start with what is good, the majority of the acting is very good. There are sterling performances from the new cast members, Luna Lovegood and particularly Delores Umbridge were well portrayed. Dumbledore, Sirius, McGonagle, Lupin, Arthur and Molley Weasley are all very good, along with main trio putting in good performances. I would agree with the amount of praise levied on Daniel Radcliffe whose performance, while good, isn't quite the Oscar winning spectacle some have made it out to be. Bonham Carter's performance as Bellatrix Lestrange was a highlight for me, some of her lines could have sounded appalling, but her delivery was perfect. However besides the acting a lot was left to be desired."
1087,9,At last a film true to the book,"In the past I have dreaded each release of the Potter films and have dragged myself to see the latest instalment. Finally with 'HP and the Order of the Phoenix' we have a film adaptation as true to the book as possible, and a film which in some way captures the imagination, like the books do. Perhaps my expectations of previous films were too high, but this flick really stuns you from start to finish and is not overacted, not trivialised and not childish in the same the previous films were. Brave Mr Yates for finally fulfilling the potential of a Harry Potter film."
1088,7,"Good, but not as good as the others.","Honestly, I was a little disappointed with this one. Up until today, the Harry Potter series was the only one that I could watch the movie adaptations of the book, but this one did not do the book justice as far as I'm concerned. The biggest thing that bothered me was how much was left out. It felt like just a paraphrase of the book. What made this even worse was that it wasn't necessarily a matter of time constraints, because this one was shorter than the rest. Also, a lot of the funny parts were left out. I know that the tone was supposed to be darker, but there could have been some parts to lighten it a little bit. There wasn't even any quidditch in this one! Another thing that i noticed (this is almost totally random, but it's been bugging me since seeing the movie) is that in the underground station, the people are spread out on the escalators. If someone isn't walking, they're supposed to keep to the right side so others can pass. Other than the parts that the film was missing, It was pretty enjoyable."
1089,10,Perfection,It ticks every box you want from a film. You got to love it.
1090,10,Amazing - 10/10 - The best Harry Potter film of the series so far,The best movie of the series made so far - in as far as the graphics and special effects are concerned.
1091,10,Absolutely amazing,"I really thought this film was excellent the acting was amazing. Even though they missed bits from the book that I thought would be in there the film it was still great.If you haven't read the book you will still get the full story It has been done brilliantly. Daniel, Rupert and Emma were fantastic as always. Luna was brilliant as was Fred and George."
1092,10,Simply Superb,"OK ill start with what you may expect:read the book by reading the book u will understand all of this film and thus you will find it more interesting,and in the contrary this is simply the best potter movie yet. One thing is certain this movie isn't for kids.now things get complicated,twisted and a bit scary sometimes therefore a more advanced age public will enjoy it best The only drawbacks about this film can be found at the duration.Fans will want a 3h film to explain all but lets take it like this: potter fans want a 3-4h film to explain all the gaps while the casual public prefers a 2h film with loads of action therefore the film satisfied both parts because it contained the most important scenes in the book masterfully changed(few) to fit the time without reducing their intensity. Still if u are a book reader fan think it like this:does the film make you feel like the book,if not watch again the scenes with umbrage,snape's past and even poor serious. Finally the battle with voldemort was simply superb,on some places it was better than the book.the effects of the death eaters fight with the order were superb to,it showed a true threat this time making things look darker as they are."
1093,7,some of the worst editing in recent years,"I wanted to like this film. The thing that really made this film disappointing was the editing. The entire pace of the film is rushed, such that almost every scene ends abruptly or cuts out way to soon. I don't blame Yates for condensing a book that is over 800 pages long, but the film is TOO CONDENSED. This is proved in the total runtime of the movie, which is only a little over 2 hours, the shortest HP film yet. Ironic that the OotP is the LONGEST book in the series but the SHORTEST film in the franchise. Therefore, everyone other than Harry and Umbridge (who both give excellent performances) gets very little film time or very few lines. Major characters such as Ron, Dumbledore, Snape, Cho Chang, and Voldemort seem unimportant because they do so little. If you are a fan of the book, be warned, because the film leaves out A LOT of things and makes some changes. For example, in the Department of Mysteries, there are no revolving doors. The fight scene only takes place in 2 rooms. Although the last 20 minutes are really exciting, it would have been even better if they included the revolving doors. Also, the movie uses the newspaper flash technique as a means to give information that could otherwise be ACTED out in a scene, but i guess that would be to hard to do. It is obvious this technique is used to the directors advantage to shorten the films runtime, but it is used so much that it gets really annoying."
1094,5,An okay movie,"When I walked into the theater, I was already feeling vibes that I would be angry at the movie for cutting out so many scenes and adding unrelated things to the movie. To me, the first movie would have to be the best, as it cut out the least. I do give some props to the writers for the movie, as they had to cut the longest book in the series and put it in a 2 hour time slot."
1095,,Great Film,"I just recently saw this movie, and I really enjoyed it. My only problem with it was it could have been a little longer and included some more scenes from the book. But, I think director David Yates did a great job narrowing the book down into this remarkable film. The casting was perfect, Umbridge was just as I imagined her, Gary Oldman was perfect as Sirius and also, the screen time that Harry and Sirius had together was great. The fight sequences where very well choreographed and shot. I was very impressed with the duel between voldemort and dumbledore. And of course, Harry, Ron and Hermonie where great too. I was very happy with script and how well the story flowed, it wasn't choppy and everything in my opinion came together great. I hope Yates sticks around for the next film, he seems to be a very good director. I am really looking forward to the rest of the Harry Potter films to be released. And having just finished the final book, I think the films will turn out to be very well indeed."
1096,6,another one that doesn't do much justice to the book,Another HP movie which doesn't have much to do with book. Apart from a couple of scenes which have been very well shot (esp. flight from pivet drive to grimmauld place and the room of prophecies) there's nothing much in the movie...agreed the the book had 956 pages and cant fit it all into the movie but then why add stuff which ain't in the book. Dobby was missing again and so were many others ... It would be best to say that the movie was inspired by JKR's book than saying its based on JKR's HP ...and pity there's no quidditch at all... one good thing is that they have included the flight of Fred and George even if its not the same as in the book !
1097,9,"Great effects, characters, and events! But...","Okay, So all and all I have to say that wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I probably ruined it for myself by reading the book only a couple weeks ago, but still. I did enjoy the movie the effects were awesome and the storyline was great. But I guess my problem is because it was the longest book in the series and it was made into the shortest movie of the series that they sort of lost some of the pieces that would have made is an even better film. However, I don't speak for anyone but myself therefore I recommend you go and see the movie for yourself and tell us what you think of it."
1098,8,Another Great Potter Film!,"Loved it! I am a die hard Harry Potter fan and therefore do not mind anything they cut out. People have to realize JK Rowling is very involved in the movie making. The director was going to cut something, but Rowling advised him not to because of the significance of this character in a future movie. So in my mind if it was cut it's not a big deal. Plus, it's the fifth movie so by now you should have read the books."
1099,6,Too much information.,"I've got to be honest, I've read the book a long time ago, so I don't remember exactly what was left out, and what was added to the movie. I'm still not sure if I liked this movie or not. I get the feeling I need to watch it again to actually make up my mind."
1100,8,"To fast, but still great",CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS:
1101,10,"My favorite HP movie, by far","This was an excellent film in all aspects, and not just because I am a hardcore Harry Potter fan. First off, the acting was superb, and you can easily see how all the actors have grown to make the characters their own. David Yates did a great job capturing the darkness of the 5th book without drowning us in unhappiness. The cinematography was absolutely fantastic. Though a few scenes which I thought very important were left out, the movie effectively covered the book without dragging along and without jumping from one event to the other. Daniel Radcliffe did a great job portraying Harry's disgust, misery, and hope. What I loved most about his movie were the relationships between the characters, and how even when we were about to witness a story-altering and epic scene (the kiss and the battle!!), the way they interacted with one another still made us laugh. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, the die-hard fanatics and those just looking for some entertainment. It's got a little something for everyone."
1102,9,A film that finally lives up to the book and fans expectations.,"When i saw the last Harry Potter film (Goblet of Fire) i was incredibly disappointed, i found the performances of the characters slightly strained and it seemed more interested in showing the action of the Triwizard tasks rather than the underlining plot. So i went in to this film expecting much of the same thing. But by god i was in for a surprise. For starters the music to the film was far more grown up, giving the mood of the film its dark atmosphere as it is felt in the book. But by far the best part of the film was the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and the cast. They all really came into their own, the characters were finally true to the books. I especially loved Luna Lovegood, i thought the acting was bang on the spot by Emmerline Vance. I did however think that Bellatrix could have had a bigger speaking part but understand that timing in the film would have been an issue. Like in the last film i found it dragged on far to long. I also think that Umbridge could have been slightly more nasty, as i didn't quite feel the hate reaction that is felt when reading the book. Many hints were also dropped during the film that true die hard fans will pick up immediately, it makes me smile how JK Rowling has put these in as a tantalising glimpse of what can be expected in Deathly Hallows. So all in all it is a must see for any Harry Potter fans, but if you are new to Harry Potter, it is probably best that you read the book first, as i fear you may get rather bored as plot line is the key part of this film, rather than constant action like the previous film. I cant wait for Deathly Hallows, and the next film. So, enjoy the film, Bibi xxx"
1103,10,"Favorite Book. Favorite Movie. ""Sirius""ly.","A novel spanning 870 pages cannot possibly fit entirely into a 2+ hour movie. A movie cannot be, like, 239587 hours long to allow every detail of the book into the movie. Obviously, things from the book are missing in the film version of ""Order and the Phoenix."" However, what is there...is fantastic."
1104,1,Yates is a Big Mistake!,"His pacing is kind of ODD! The acting was horrible. It sounded very scripted like everyone was waiting for their lines. Everything was just off. The only good part was the climax, the battle between the order and Dumbledore versus Voldemort."
1105,4,hardly worth seeing,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, both the books and the films, I came away from watching this film feeling extremely disappointed. From the moment the first scene appears, you can tell that it is poorly directed. The scene showing Harry and Dudley running away is filmed in such a modern, snappy, messy way that you wonder what film you are actually watching. The camera shots used are nothing like the ones in the other films, which makes it distinctly different."
1106,5,OK movie. better book.,"i was very excited for this movie to come out. i saw it in imax three d. and i was actually very disappointed with how they showed everything. i read the book. the battle in the department of mysteries? half of everything was gone. and i understand that it would be hard to show everything but they could of added a lot more than what they showed. i wanted to see the brain room. they didn't even add the swamp when i Weasley twins exited. and no quidditch? that was a huge part to me. Weasley is our king, harry and the Wesley twins being banned and when the Weasley's exited i wanted to see everything going on. it was okay for me. but i think it jumped around to fast."
1107,7,"Not perfect, but it never could be...","In my opinion, the book is simply too big for it to be done justice by a two hour twenty minute film. I was impressed however by the effort that was made. Sure, there were lots of things left out, but the main body of the story was there."
1108,3,Worst of the Potter Movies,"I don't want to say too much about this movie, I already wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this, but for me as a viewer who hasn't read the book, nothing made sense in this flick.........there wasn't any continuity. They started a storyline and than just dropped it, no explanation why this and that happened, nothing nada zilch. "
1109,3,Waste of money,There is not anything new in this movie at all....twirling wands? That was 3 or 4 movies ago. There was no real additional character development either in this movie with Harry's friends doing next to nothing in this movie. They could have been cardboard cutout stand ins for all they did. Then there is the tired old story of an unjust evil or manipulative teacher or principal? Come on..that is very unoriginal. This was just a punch of the clock for cold hard cash in the series...a money making killing for capitalists and a bust for movie audiences. I'd recommend seeing some of the first 3 movies over again instead of seeing this one.
1110,,Needs a better director.,"This is a movie that only people that have read the book will understand - and, unfortunately, it is obviously these people that will be let down. The plot moves along at an exceedingly fast, cut-and-snip pace that leaves simple cinematic nuances on the cutting room floor, going at a pace that would be more suitable to a bomb-filled action movie than a magical one."
1111,9,Honestly - the best one yet...,"I know people were ""wowed"" by the medieval style of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and i admit that it was a great refresher from the dull drone of the first two movies. The Goblet of Fire was a let-down as a film but i feel that director Yates has successfully made a film that is both faithful to the book and entertaining."
1112,7,Impressions,"There are very many differences between the book and the movie,therefore I was disappointed,but this not the only reason.The movie doesn't really contain the book's atmosphere,it doesn't make you feel as excited and powerful as the book makes you feel when it shows you about the D.A. and the student's rebellion.The book has a more beautiful spirit and the movie could of been better directed to show it.Teenage Snape and Marauders look lousy.They could of chosen better-looking actors more similar to the adult ones.The spell ""Levicorpus"" doesn't appear until the 6th book,Harry reads it in the Half-Blood Prince's book,as his own invention.However the scene from the Ministry of Magic is great.The duels,everything is great in spite of the differences between book and movie.Helena Bonham Carter is more than perfect to play Bellatrix Lestrange.Alan Rickman (in playing Snape) as well,as he has from the beginning.Evanna Lynch plays Luna good too.The movie wasn't so bad,but it could of been exceptional."
1113,9,Great movie if you haven't read the book,"I really love to read a book before seeing the movie. I also really wanted to finally see a Harry Potter movie in the theater (I usually wait until DVD). Since I was behind on reading, I spent about 4 weeks reading Harry Potter 4 then 5. They day after finishing Order of the Pheonix, I went to see the movie. I must say I was a bit disappointed. "
1114,5,VERY disappointed,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! I LOVE harry potter, and i have read all the books at least 5 times (except #7, only twice i think}. but anyways. I walked in the theater expecting it to be another great movie, but i didn't get what i expected. Its probably because of my knowledge of the books, but this movie was way too choppy and abrupt. i was left sitting in my seat after a new scene started thinking to myself...wait, what just happened? i wasn't very happy with the plot changes, and things they left out that i felt they would need later on in the movies to make them complete without having to alter them any further."
1115,9,Very accurate compared to past movies,"I thought #5 was so much more accurate than any of the previous movies. I really hate the way they made Goblet of Fire, they cut out so many things that a lot of HP fans thought were major aspects of the book. Phoenix leaves most of the small things in, the inner office memos (paper airplanes) that fly around the ministry of magic, Umbridges cats all over her walls on plates, Hagrid soaking his cuts from Grawp with steak. Even some of the lines the actors spoke were right out of the book, word for word. The only time I remember this happening in GOF is when Voldemort says ""kill the spare."" The fight at the Ministry is cut way down, but they do have to make cuts for time reasons. The only thing that really made me mad about Phoenix is when Sirius dies. I bawled like a baby when Cedric died, as much as GOF sucked, at least they got one scene right! LOL When Sirius died, you don't really feel anything, you know it's coming and they just didn't make it very dramatic in my opinion. And the veil isn't as described in the book. In case you haven't seen the movie, I won't say anymore. I really think this is the best movie by far. Having read all the books several times and seen the movies, I am normally very very angry after leaving a new HP film and this one actually made me smile when I was leaving. Oh and the girl that plays Luna is AWESOME!!!! LOL"
1116,8,The best Harry Potter film yet.,"I've been reading some pretty exaggerated, ranting, angry reviews about this film and it's making me frustrated. I just went to see HP5 last night at midnight and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge, huge fan of the books, the 5th and 6th books being my favorites, so I was very skeptical about how Yates would fit the biggest Potter book (864 pages) into a two hour movie. I almost wondered if I should go see the movie at all, since past HP movies have ruined the image of the books in my head. I've been pretty indifferent to the past movies; I thought the first two were good adaptations of the books but still only mediocre. I remember seeing Prisoner of Azkaban opening night and walking out EXTREMELY disappointed, and the Goblet of Fire was only OK in my opinion. After seeing Order of the Phoenix, however, I was relieved. Yates does an excellent job fitting the majority of the story into a mere two hours, leaving out only minor story lines or scenes from the book, which is to be expected. The three main child actors (Harry, Ron, Hermione) did much better in this film. I remember one of the things that made me angry in the 4th movie was how Hermione acted like a 30 year old biotch and over-acted almost all the time. I thought Dumbledore was much better in this film as well, I thought in the 4th movie he was a bit out of character, frequently getting angry and yelling at Harry. All in all this was by far my favorite Potter film yet and I highly suggest seeing it to anyone who reads this and who is a fan. I think it's important to realize that if you are a true HP fan, the movies will never compare to the magic of reading the books, so go into the movie with an open mind and you'll be very satisfied. Luckily Yates is already signed on to direct Half Blood Prince."
1117,8,For movie and book fans alike.,"I consider myself a die hard fan of both the books and the movies, but I also believe what works for the pages does not work for the big screen, and vice versa."
1118,2,the plot lets i down,everything i the movie is quite well done. except one thing: the plot. And as its happening to be the plot is most vital for a successful movie. They crammed in information that weren't necessary and made plainly the wrong choices of what to include. The cuts are jumpy and the transitions from one scene to another are very confusing.
1119,,Prepared Me Well For The Next Film,"I'd been looking forward to this film for a long time. Ever since I read the fifth book, around the same time the fourth movie came out. So, I was really excited to finally find out how this book translated to film."
1120,4,Harry Pottter Six Needs A New Director Now,"Yesterday, I saw the movie for the first time and was extremely disappointed. First, I was shocked that Harry displayed practically no anger in the movie. The book and the cast knew Harry was angry at the beginning of the story. What in the world convinced the director to think he could down play the tension between Harry and his friends and still make a good movie? Harry was attacked by dementors and about to be disciplined for it! When he arrives at Grimmauld Place and is only curt with Ron and Hermione the scene becomes a huge let down. The second reason I didn't like the movie was because some of the actors' lines are poorly written and placed. For example, after Harry, Ron, and Hermione have their awkward conversation about what's been going on the twins apparate into the room because they supposedly heard Harry. I barely heard the conversation so there is no way the twins could have known Harry arrived if they were in another bedroom. Also, there is this scene between Harry and Sirius at Christmas time in which Sirius informs Harry that this was his childhood home. Even if I had not read the book, I would never have believed Harry didn't wonder or figure out who owned the house during his first stay there. Third and finally, I was not that impressed with the special effects. I thought the dementors and the death eaters looked more scary in the previous movies. And the scene where Sirius talks to Harry from the common room fireplace didn't look like he used magic. It looked like he used the oldest cheapest computer he could find. I have read the books, but I am not upset that some scenes were cut. I'm upset that the people in charge did such a lousy job with the scenes they chose to include."
1121,9,"Brillianty made, poorly developed",I've just seen the 5th film and i when it was finished i was feeling kinda empty in me. I was sad not because of the deaths which in the movie were too quick but because the film had so many differences from the book. The book was superb the story was excellent and they took the main story or some of it actually and left behind very important things who should be mentioned. Like the mirror Sirius gave to Harry so they can communicate was not in the film and it played some very important role in the book because in the end we see Harry crying in front of it calling Sirius to come. Also another important thing is that the dream Harry saw and went to the ministry searching for Sirius it was the elf of Sirius who made it and we actually see that he was a traitor and he was working for Voldemort. Also in the book the talk between Dumbldore and Harry in the end is completely different there are other very important things which had to be said. There are other things too who for those who have read the books were left behind or changed and for those who were just watching the movie were questions left unanswered. Like what happened to Umbridge?...The film just like film and not based in a story was super the special effects well made the story was smooth and was perfect. The reason i put 9 stars is because its the franchise perfect. The one star lacking is because of the story difference.
1122,3,Table: to narrow.,"The table in the weasley household is far to narrow to be practical. If you are sitting on the sides, it's not to bad you don't have tons of space buts it's still usable however if you are unfortunate enough to sit on the edge all your, already limited space is taken up by the people sitting on the edge. Over all this table would make for a truly unfortunate dinning experience."
1123,9,"Excellent Movie, well worth a look","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the longest book of the series weighing in at a rather hefty 766 pages (UK Hardback Edition published by Bloomsbury 2003). Rather ironically, its become the shortest Potter movie made to date at 138 minutes long."
1124,7,"Worth watching, although not amazing","This movie seemed a lot more artistic than the other movies. It's more abstract, more visual. Now don't get me wrong, I love artistic films, but with Harry Potter? You just don't do that. The film was choppy (not in a bad way, but shouldn't have been done with HP), with momentary glimpses into the plot and a few specific details pointed out."
1125,2,Okay very funny. Now show us the real movie!!,"I'm not usually one to post comments on films. As a matter of fact this is my first time writing a review, but as a fan of the Harry Potter series(both books and films), I felt it my responsibility to warn fellow moviegoers of the latest adaption of our favorite boy wizard's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
1126,8,"Very good movie, but should have been done in 2 parts","I think overall for doing a 900 page book into one movie it was good. Obviously any of us who have read the book will all say the same thing. It should have been done in 2 parts to cover all the pertinent material. However since it was done as one movie, they did the best they could. The story flowed nicely and showed the progression from sad young Harry to angry teenage Harry. The emotional factor was just right (several people in the theater were crying.) I think as an avid reader of books I've come to accept that movies will always be far inferior to the book themselves. As a huge Stephen King fan I've learned that a great book doesn't necessarily a great movie make. But there are exceptions. Jaws was an equally well written book as well as a movie (even though there are several obvious differences between the two.) Anyway my point is that this movie was enjoyable from start to finish with a strong and emotional storyline. Did it equal the book? No. But it didn't destroy it either."
1127,9,Amazing Cast+ Amazing special effects= Amazing Movie,"I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter books and I didn't expect them to be able to fit everything that's in a 870 paged book into a two hours and eighteen minute movie. I was thoroughly impressed by Evanna Lynch's performance as Luna Lovegood, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. In nearly every scene, Emma Watson is still acting as though she had just shot the scene after running a mile. I noticed that Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint's acting has improved. Tom Felton(Draco Malfoy) has been given less lines despite the fact that he has to play a big role in the next movie. The special effects are like nothing we ever seen before and we get to see the even darker side of the magical world than we did in the first four movies. Overall, this movie was in my opinion the best Harry Potter so far."
1128,10,The film is excellent! Bravo Daniel Radcliffe! Bravo David Yates!,The Order of the Phoenix
1129,10,the best harry potter movie yet !!!,"these movies just keep getting better and better. while not every detail in the movie is there, but who cares. best movie ever. the acting and story where all superb. David is probably the best directors of the whole series.the visual effects were amazing and the overall movie kept me wanting more and more. On top of all that, the music was probably my favorite part of the movie. Easily the best composer of the series.the ending is so explosive but sad at the same time. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone. The three main actor get better and better with every movie. I already can't wait for the 6th movie. Go harry!!!"
1130,10,Not the best but pretty decent (especially in IMAX 3D) (Read whole review!!!!!),"Well this movie was not the best out of the five so far. The best was 3 and then thinking 4 and now 5. This movie had lots of talking in it but it was still like AWESOME. It still is a must see I'm not saying i hated it or anything, but i just didn't like it so much; I LOVED IT! So yeah you should watch it but if you want LOTS of fun IMAX would do, but not necessary you can still go to your local multiplex, regal, AMC Theatere, etc. So overall this movie deserves an A and if it was a notch better A++. And even though, even though the movie had LOTS of talking, it was interesting and there were so many FUNNY PARTS AND ACTION SCENES. So I'm about to change my mind to the second best! Still close to the best! So just watch it no matter what, where, when (well actually before it gets out of theaters!)"
1131,10,Brilliant movie even though there are scenes missing!!,I am a hardcore HP fan. I read all J.K. Rowling's books and I watched all the movies as well. I admit that I was expecting a really disappointing movie since the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book from the Harry Potter series so far. However I am really surprised. I just returned home from the movie and I confess my self really satisfy with the work of David Yates. For once more the characters were brilliant and successful chosen for the casting. Professor Umbridge performance is brilliance as well as the acting of Bellarix who transfers the feeling of madness to the spectator. The fight of the of the aurors against the death eaters is also spectacular as well as the fight of Dumbledore against Voldemord even though I would like to last longer. The graphics of the movie are also amazing. In few words Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a must see Summer 2007 movie.
1132,9,Leaving aside the book comparisons...,"Since I saw the midnight show last night, I have been reading a lot of things online concerning how much story was cut from the movie, or how the movie was good but could never compare to the book. As a devoted Harry Potter fan, I prefer to keep the movies and books as separate entities. The films are each respectively a director's interpretation of a book, and leaving aside Chris Colombus (whom I am not insulting whatsoever), each director chose to take certain liberties and focus on certain plot lines. I personally think that David Yates is a GENIUS filmmaker. I went into the movie NOT expecting a perfect replica of my beloved 900 pages. Instead I came in with an open mind and I left with a satisfying movie experience that left me talking about for hours. Between the often documentary-style camera work, the smart, plot outlining newspaper montages, the personal touch added to the CGI's of the dementors, Kreacher, Grawp, the centaurs AND VOLDEMORTS POSSESSION OF HARRY'S BODY (my personal fave visual effect) and the wonderfully elaborate set designs, I was more than pleased with this film. And, of course, the humor was spot on and the crowd at my theater must have found at least 20 triumphant moments that makes a HarryPotter fan need to shout out and cheer. And how much the young actors have really grown into themselves! THe filmmaker seemed to really have a grasp on a relationship such as Ron and Hermione's, and filled nearly every moment with the wonderful awkwardness ever present between them. Plus, our new Umbridge and Luna were forces to be reckoned with, both with strong grasps on their characters. Their performances also reminded me that each and every JKR reader does not imagine any character the same, and therefore each actor will be putting on display their very own interpretations. Only disappointments: the concluding parts at the Ministry seemed rushed, and I wish there was more Tonks, she was really just a visual addition rather than a character. Of course I was sad to leave behind ""Weasley is our King"", Luna's lion hat, the St. Mungo's visit, etc...but Yates was more than sufficient in making up for the absences of our favorite side stories."
1133,10,Amazing Movie...fairly close to the book,"OK...so I saw the 5th movie yesterday at an early release party. And it was amazing. As expected it was sad and getting progressivly darker. But it is still amazing. They stayed pretty close to the book and didn't stray from the path too much. But they did leave a lot out. But that is also expected...how much info can you take from a 870 page book and cram into a 2.5 hour movie. The computer graphics are also amazing, but I must say that I'm was sad not to see some things in the movie that were in the book. I hope that I haven't spoiled anything for those of you that haven't seen it yet...I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did...:)"
1134,8,i confess myself slightly disappointed,"hmm, where do i start. well it started of well...they missed out Dumbledore's ""remember my last"" howler, which left me annoyed. neway the movie was well paced and all, and bits were carefully included here or there. However i did feel a bit or lot hurried. the DA meetings were good. the ministry scene was also great, but was it just me or somebody also felt that Dubmledore was shown weak in front of Voldemort and where did the scene go in which Dumbledore and harry have a chat. That was how i connected emotionally with Dumbledore, and I'm sure many other did, u know his predicament and why he did what he did. the prophecy was also just put there for the sake of it...and had i not read the book i might have branded the story another one of those with the ""chosen one"" and the ""prophecy"" themes. come on...jk added so much to it...apart from just the text of the prophecy....what ever happened to Neville being so imp and almost being in Harry's place. sorry guys I'm never fussy about book to movie translations because i know they have time constraints...but plot outlines??....as i said before...i confess myself slightly disappointed...(could've made it a 3 hr movie...i do recall 3 hr adaptations that have done ""reasonably"" well...kidding...amazingly well. anyway...a well deserved 8/10 for trying very hard...good effects, and the ministry scene...oh yeah and Luna for really good...very true to the book"
1135,,worth the midnight showing,"Weird Warning: if you get motion sickness easily, take some Dramamine before the movie. I was nauseous halfway in and actually covering my eyes for part of the ministry battle. I thought I would miss the ending while cleaning vomit off the theater floor. I am Very Sensitive to this sort of thing so don't worry about it if you could take more than ten minutes of Blair Witch Project."
1136,9,final combat scene,"With such an overwhelming number of comments, I would like to emphasize only one thing which I think really deserves special praise: the final combat scene within the ministry is stunningly remarkable. The absolutely breath-taking rhythm, the way how a real ""mêlée"" within the wizarding world might look was portrayed, the extent to which the art of magic performed could be action-packed, all of these are realized to an indeed unprecedented - if not its nearly fullest, well, with at least two sequels awaiting - degree, which altogether make the whole of it not only totally fascinating but truly believable, to the extent that all of them seem to happen in a rather short amount of time. A masterpiece beyond, or even replenishing imagination. Simply adore it."
1137,9,A great movie for family viewing,"Another great Harry Potter movie! This movie is very raw, especially in the beginning, and that's a good thing-it makes the movie seem more realistic. This is the first film that feels so raw, the later films have much more of this idea. It's quite a challenge to have a good character that everyone genuinely hates, not because it's badly written, but because of how well it's written, and Umbridge was done superbly--I would say that Umbridge is the best example of a well-written character that everyone genuinely hates. Despite all that, The Order was really cool, and while I wish we had spent more time with The Order and gotten to know them better, it was a great movie, as always, and it leaves us wanting to watch more!"
1138,8,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
1139,8,Best Potter film to date,"It's dark, it's the most faithful to date, and it has the best plot as of yet. The starting minutes are a bit on the bad side, suffering from the same thing the ending the last of the Potter flick suffered, which is it felt a bit rushed. Nevertheless, these minutes are brief, and as soon as Harry arrives at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, things start to get good. New characters such as Loona Lovegood or Dolores Umbridge are expertly represented, and old characters (mainly Harry and Hermione) have never been represented better. The movie doesn't take everything from the book though, and it shows, however, it usually doesn't take very important parts. The ending is something to admire, because it is one of the parts were it is actually better than the book."
1140,7,The good outweighs the bad,The good moments definitely outweigh all the bad by a lot but thats unfortunately still not really enough to get this to the highs of the first three films in this franchise.
1141,5,"Special effects: Outstanding, actors: Ecxeeds Expectations, music: Acceptable, cut: Poor, plot: Dreadful","==========THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS, SO STOP HERE IF YOU ARE STRONGLY AGAINST SPOILERS.============= So here I am, the latest victim of the Potter-Movie-Mania. At least I wanted to see the movie to bridge the time to the last novel. If the movie had passed the OWLs it would have reached three out of five: 1. The S-E: they are really outstanding! What the artists have created is really more than I ever expected. Especially the realization of the fight scenes was magnificent! Also outstanding was the creation of the scenery such as Umbridges office and the Ministry of Magic, they were absolutely unique."
1142,6,Disappointed but expected. Spoiler,I do believe a lot of parts were glossed over and the acting could have been much better. And I'm leaving out most of the little errors and things that shouldn't have been left out.
1143,9,Best one so far. Seriously.,"When I learned that this was the shortest film out of all five, I'll be honest- I thought it would suck. I mean, putting 870 (or 766 in the UK) pages into a 138-minute long film... seems impossible, right? Wrong. At least not for David Yates and Michael Goldenberg. Of course stuff was cut- the St. Mungo's scene, for instance, Harry and Cho's date- and a lot was moved around. If you're a die-hard fan of the books, you will be angry. But if you go in accepting that things will be cut or moved around, and that you probably won't like it, but try to see what's good about the movie, you'll enjoy it."
1144,7,It wasn't as good as it should have been.,"Once again we packed the theaters once again to watch our good friends Harry, Ron, and Hermione take on yet another year at Hogwarts. The overall performance and outcome of the movie was good, but not up to expectations...or at least mine.The acting was overall well played as Daniel Radcliffe again shows his skill. Emma Watson is growing up nicely, but she puts on a low scale performance and Rupirt in the middle. However, new comer Evanna Lynch shines in her light role as Luna Lovegood. Her ability to have that straight tone voice puts a good laugh in. Moving onto the movie, the movie to me seemed too slow, and only a few action sequences made me feel bored during parts. And EVEN with the intense action sequences seemed low key(not going to spoil). The movie, in my opinion, did not live up to the bar set by the Goblet and the Prisoner. The story line follows maybe about 90% of the book, but like before, it seemed slow. Emma, Daniel, and Rupirt still have that click about them and you can definitely tell there into the movie,maybe a bit too much? OK well off with the bad and to the good. Themovie IS good, don't get me wrong. The colorful cast puts on a show and makes you feel attached to everyone of them. And for bonus points, most if not all are still the same actors and actresses. The CGI images and transitions are steller and I was amazed. So... all in all I think this movie could of and should have been better. In my honest opinion I'd recommend Transformers before this. Transformers is a change of pace and I highly recommend the film. But it was good to see our three main stars in yet another evolution through puberty. Seven out of Ten"
1145,6,"Not too shabby, not all that great","I went to see this film today, and although i must congratulate David Yates on some good directing in some places, overall it felt to me as if i sat through 2 hours of nothing."
1146,,Decent but lacking,"I am a huge fan of the books, but to me, the Harry Potter movies have always been a bit of a let down. I see most people are giving it outstanding reviews, so i figured id make a review on the other side of the coin. I realize they cant make a 5 hour movie, but they should have taken out some of the made up scenes and add in more of the important details. I felt, as i have felt in all the other movies, that this one was bare. It went from main point to main point, missing out on a lot of the details that make this series so great. As for the acting, I do believe that Emma and Rupert should have bigger roles. I know that the mood is suppose to get darker and more desperate, but I think Daniel overplayed his role a bit and ended up sounding too winy. Special effects were great, music score was great, but it just didn't meet my expectations. 3 out of 5 stars"
1147,10,Fast Paced movie...,"First of all,let this thing get straight:""If you are to make a movie entirely according to the 800+ book, it would take 6-8 hrs of a movie"".So die hard readers of HP book- be ready to get disappointed when you go for this movie as the movie does not entirely portray the book.But as in whole it has tried to get the essence of the book but being the shortest movie(only 2hrs and 18 mins!!!) its natural that we readers would feel disheartened.This is exactly what happened to me when i went to watch the most awaited HPATOOTP.The only thing i felt they should have tried to show us more, was about the prophecy.In the book,the prophecy has been given so much importance and had been explained so much ,well, in the movie it gets over in 2 mins(making only the part"" should kill each other as neither can survive when the other is alive"" clear to the audience) The remaining part of the prophecy(how Neville came close to being the ""Boy who lived"" has been left out and there is no further explanation of the same(sigh!!)Furthermore i was surprised to see how the character of Dumbledore was changed: He is being shown as an extremely powerful and a strong character whereas we all know how he is in the book.Well to say it short, the director has done a good job in putting across the essence of the book to the audience in just 2hrs and 18 mins.They could have stretched the movie a little more( thats what book readers would say i guess :-) ),otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable,fast paced movie(with gripping climax and effects)."
1148,8,Pretty good,"For anyone watches the movies but doesn't read the books, you'll be a little confused at times, such as when Tonks is changing her nose, because it's not explained at all. And I was a little disappointed to see that they had cut out the St.Mungo scene that I was so looking forward to seeing. I understand that a lot of scenes needed to be cut out, but the fact that somehow this was made into the shortest HP movie yet is beyond me, especially considering how OOTP is the longest book in the HP series. There were also a loose end in this film that didn't get tied, such as the Harry/Cho drama. We find out that Cho betrayed the DA, but then we find out that she was under the influence of Veritaserum, so it wasn't her fault at all, but we don't see Harry trying to make up with Cho after he finds out about this. Maybe he will do this in the next film, but I highly doubt it. On the plus side of this whole film, I really haven't laughed this much in this film as much as the others. It really funny at times, but not so much that it sugar coats the darkness of the film. The acting was amazing, even though I think Hermione and Ron should have played a more active role in this movie, and even the actor who plays Dumbledor is less...tense is the only word I can use to describe his acting in the previous film (i.e the yelling and scowling). Overall, this movie wasn't bad, it was certainly better than GOF, but they shouldn't have cut so much from the book."
1149,6,Why Yates?,"I read the books, I like the books but for some reasons The movie versions seems to be so,so... So, well, honestly I wasn't too interested when a friend of mine asked me to watch this movie on the first day of its release. "
1150,8,the saga continues and the anticipation grows...,"this film was always going to be overshadowed by the imminent release of the final book (the deathly hallows)but, as another director takes the chair (and let's face it there've been as many directors as there have been defence against the dark arts teachers) we're whisked away on yet another potter adventure. the film sets out, full of promise with gorgeous sweeping shots of British suburbia that inevitably lead us to harry. the film immediately takes a dark turn, with harry and his cousin Dudley being attacked by dementors (who look even scarier this time around). the first scene basically sets the tone for the entire film, dark and foreboding. a lot has been said of this film losing it's ""magic"" but there are many who beg to differ. there are moments of light with the weasley twins most spectacular exit from hogwarts and new favourite, Luna lovegood with her delightful monahan accent and whimsical air. this film plays an extremely important role in the series, voldemort is back, but no one wants to admit it. the entire film is a fight for the truth, evil is taking over once more and understandably, there really is very little room for the magical whimsy we've come to expect. this is dark stuff, and director, David Yates makes that very clear."
1151,9,Different to book....but still bloody good,"Exceeds expectations....however, I must say that I felt the makers of the film left out some of the best scenes (such as the St.Mungos//Lockhart/Nevilles Parents scene). The score (as in the music)was not as uplifting/scary/whatever it needed to be to fit in as it had previously been in the other films. However, compared to the other films, the settings, costumes and makeup have improved vastly."
1152,7,Honestly....,"I went to see this movie alone, as none of my friends are Harry Potter fans, and I really didn't feel like dragging anyone with me. I have read every review thus far before deciding to post my comments. I have also read every Harry Potter book twice, some three times. I read OotP three times, most recently last week. I feel there are two very distinct points of views for this movie: those who have read the book, and those who have not. I place no judgment on those who have not read the book, as they are giving to their opinion of a MOVIE they saw. Those who have read the book are giving their opinion of a BOOK they envisioned, and then saw."
1153,8,Very similar to the book for a 2 + hour movie. Very good! Luna was my favorite!,"I thought this movie was one of the best yet. It had some variances from the book, but that is expected for the allotted time frame. It had breath-taking effects and wonderfully exciting action scenes."
1154,6,Order of the Phoenix,First off let me say I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan.
1155,7,Very nice addition to the series.,"I had incredibly low expectations for this movie, and I actually didn't know I was going to see it opening night until my friends told me they had tickets like six hours before the show. Needless to say, I was quite impressed."
1156,8,Sigh of Relief,"I read a spot on review from Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone. Too bad many of the other reviewers didn't enjoy the same experience I did. Smooth and much better pacing than 4. Darker, more internal conflict and beautiful. Director capitalized on every little moment and look (poor Ginny). Every scene played out with me thinking ""nicely done."" Kudos to Alan Rickman--further proof why he was the perfect choice for Snape, the unsung hero. The only thing I missed from the book was the opportunity to see the emotions play across Rupert Grint's face during the Slytherin/Gryffindor Quidditch match. Ah well, can't have everything."
1157,5,HP and OOTP,"This was by far my favorite book but the movie, to me was disappointing, but only to the extent of being based off a book. As a movie in general it was excellent. I didn't like how short it was, it was the shortest movie and one of the things I like about the Harry Potter movie series is their length."
1158,9,An Excellent Film,"Although many will disagree, I believe that this Harry Potter film was the greatest one yet. I've grown up in the Harry Potter craze, with both the books and the movies. Many people are complaining that the fifth installment to the series ""left out way too much"" and ""skipped a huge part of the book!"" I have a different point of view than these people. I thought that the movie flowed very nicely, and that they didn't leave out anything 'major' or that will play a greater part in the sixth and seventh movies. I talked to my friend, who does not read the books, although she enjoys the movies, and says that it made sense to her, even though it wasn't as packed as the book was. Overall, I'd say this movie was fantastic. Not only did it flow nicely, but the younger actors greatly improved. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) really stood out (obviously, because he's the main character), and did an excellent portrayal of all the different emotions and pains Harry felt as described in the book. This movie was the best, by far, and all those who are complaining fail to see the greater aspects of the movie."
1159,9,Fifth Harry Potter Film Pulls It All Together,"Just when I thought that another Summer movie sequel just might send me over the edge, Harry Potter saves the day. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix provides an all-star display of all the best elements of the previous four J.K. Rowling stories. Surprisingly tight at two hours and fourteen minutes, the latest Potter presentation predictably takes us back to Hogwarts, but don't think for a minute that you have seen all this before. Director David Yates delivers a movie with style and a consistent rhythm that makes the familiar characters and locations seem new and more exciting than ever."
1160,5,satisfactory,well i never could get my self to like the movies... but this one's OK. i mean the only reason i can catch up and actually not rate it awful is because i have read the book!. i cannot bring my self to like the casting specially NOT Radcliffe's and Watson isn't anything like Hermione...well she's Hermione all glamorous up if you know what i mean! i love Grint he is everything i imagined Ron to be! and i do not like Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore one bit he just ruins the magic and charm. personally i think harry potter would have been better off without the movies. overall its disappointing just like any other book adaptations OTHER then LORD OF THE RINGS!
1161,8,The fantastic story of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was amazingly remade into one of the most memorable movies of the (soon to be) 7.,This movie came from a fantastic and hard-to-cram-into-two-hours book by JK Rowling. I most definitely give props to the writers who wonderfully manipulated the script to contain everything you needed to know and still be under 3 hours. 
1162,9,Harry Potter Fanatics In Hollywood,you have to see this video - http://tinyurl.com/2dx6x5 
1163,10,harry potter 5 is excellent,Hats off to Jk Rowling for the creativity and the way she narrates the story. harry potter 5 on the screen is not disappointing. Its very worth to watch the film on big screen. I think some of the plots are missing which are there in book. yet it is the best move that can be movie made out of the book. 10 points out of 10 to the director
1164,4,Not remotely like the book,"When I read the fifth Harry Potter I absolutely loved it. I've read certain parts probably more than twenty times. The movie was nothing like the book at all. What really annoys me and my friends is that the fifth movie didn't even suggest that during Harry's fifth year he does have a little bit of fun and quite a few laughs. The movie leaves out extremely important things that need to be in it and I'm not sure how the sixth one is going to work at all. Hermione Granger, Ron Weasly and Draco Malfoy's parts were all pretty much non-existent. I'm almost sure that Fred and George have more lines than Ron and Hermione. Luna Lovegood is really the only thing that seems to come directly from the book, without much change. The actress, Evanna Lynch did a fantastic job and her voice has just the right amount of the ""dreaminess"" that the books describe it has. Not only that but the character herself is portrayed well and you feel quite a bit of sympathy for her. What I suggest you do is read the books then rent the movie if you're bored and find all the things they changed, left out or added to the movie."
1165,7,Please bring Steve Kloves back...,"I saw the first four movies without reading the books and I loved them all. Once I read the books, I understood the movies a whole lot better but I still felt that they did justice to the books. Maybe it was this difference in order that made me have such high expectations for Order of the Phoenix - there were so many scenes that I'd read about that I was dying to see in the movie - but I have to say that overall, I was very disappointed by this movie. I understand that a lot had to be cut, especially given that this was the longest book, but there was SO MUCH missing that I don't think it would have been difficult to include. There is no reason that this movie should be the shortest when this book was the longest. Even ten or 15 more minutes worth of scenes would have made this movie perfectly amazing. Even a lot of the things that were actually included in the movie were changed, which was just as disappointing as the things we didn't see at all."
1166,8,"""I Have to Admit It's Getting Better...""","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite one yet. It's surprising that the longest book in the series gets the shortest screen time, but it's even more surprising to see that it works. Splendidly, in fact. I feel that a lot of details in OotP are superfluous anyway, and that leaving them out of the big screen makes the movie feel more like a movie and less like a tedious adaptation (and I'm a huge fan of the books BTW). Regardless, there are some disappointments that prevent the movie from becoming perfect:"
1167,4,"If you're a fan of the books, don't see it!","I've been a fan of the HP series since 3rd grade and am persuading my younger brother to read them, too. Now a senior in high school, I still love the books and some of the movies. This is my favorite book...but it's the worst movie so far. They took so much out of the book and made the shortest HP movie yet out of the longest book. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when they didn't put ANY quidditch in it! Especially when Ron was supposed to be the new keeper!!! Dudley looked ridiculous, the ministry of magic was WRONG. The scene changes were choppy and awkward...almost a Pirates of the Caribbean feel to it. The only good thing I can say is the fight between Voldemort and Dumbledore was pretty good. Short, but I liked the water vs fire part."
1168,8,"One HP (series, not movies) fan who thinks it was a good adaptation","I have never been compelled to comment, but I'm actually angry over this. People need to relax. Yes, there are many wonderful moments in the book that obviously made the plot richer, the characters more endearing and just in general ADDED to the magic of the book. Yes, the movie was choppy and a bit discombobulated at times. However, you can't want a slower paced movie AND more details."
1169,4,in my humble opinion,"By far this movie is my least favorite in the series, while the special effects were to die for and the wizard battles were good the rest did little for me. The worst part is they added a ton of new characters and didn't give you any back story on them what so ever, in my opinion this movie seemed to almost be a direct rip from star wars episode 2. My suggestion is to go buy the books that way you can actually meet the new characters and gain a better perspective of what the movie should have been like. If your gonna spend money to go see a great movie I suggest that you go see Transformers and save order of the Pheonix for a DVD rental."
1170,6,Too high were my expectations.,"This movie almost seems as if the film makers assume you've read the book. For someone who hasn't, it leaves you in your seat pleading for answers. What happened? Who's that? It is rushed through so much, it almost feels like a puzzle where none of the pieces fit together. The transition from scene to scene is lousy and with no explanation as to how they got there. It has its moments of suspense and emotion, but as a whole, it is not worth paying to see it at the theater. The scene I was looking forward to the most, Snape's worst memory, was not at all portrayed like it was in the book (No pensieve was involved, but rather a spell.) and lasted a good ten or twenty seconds. This movie was the biggest disappointment yet. My rating of six is quite generous, to be honest. I only rated so high because the acting was quite good. Also, the overall effects were nice. However, this movie is nothing like the book, and it contains too many differences and left-out details. Do not see it if you're easily disappointed or as much of a Harry Potter nut as my friend and I."
1171,3,acting and dialog good,"I just saw it. The plot and acting were on par for the previous movies. However, the musical background was not BACKGROUND. The music was so loud during the whole movie that, I was turned off from it. Almost, I wanted to leave. The only reason I stayed was, It was 'Harry Potter'. After the prolonged wait, I was NOT about to leave without watching it all the way. The previous 'Harry Potter' movies were outstanding, and I would feel comfortable recommending to any person or family. I am not sure if it was the new director or the particular theater that I visited. Just to be on the safe side, the next movie I will wait for the DVD."
1172,2,piece of crap,let us begin with the good sides of the movie.
1173,9,Best Harry Potter movie yet,I wish I could have seen more Tonks but other than that I thought this was the best result so far. I thought HP4 was a disaster in it's taking liberties and missing characters traits and looks. I feel that the travesty is not in leaving out information but rather adding new material that does not belong. HP5 does not do this as much and where it does take liberties is far less crucial and jarring as in the past movies. This movie took the time to show the characters and included things hat would have been edited in past movies. It's very difficult to apply all the things that make the books so loved. What you are looking for is a capturing of the essence and plot of the book. HP5 does this; both me and my 11 year old daughter loved it. Most have complained about the representation of Dumbledore and for that I would agree. I don't feel it's a matter of acting talent so much as a misunderstanding of the character by Gambon. Dumbledore should be warmer and slightly silly at times. This is a matter of direction and is a bit of a problem since the movies lost Harris.
1174,4,"If you like the book, you will hate this movie","Absolutely lots of unnecessary changes from the book (e.g. Mad-eye Moody did something in the book, but it will be Sirius doing it in the movie). "
1175,10,Magic never felt so good!,"Lets get one thing straight, I am a big Potter fan. I have read all the books, seen all the films blah blah blah. The fifth book for me was one that seemed to drag, I didn't find it as interesting as the other books although it was still good. With this in mind, I approached the film with a little apprehension. But what I didn't expect was to be this blown away."
1176,9,Brilliant Movie!,"As many people around the world who have been captivated by JK Rowlings Harry Potter series, i was extremely nervous to see this movie, the book had been one of my favourites. As my friends had seen the film before me had disliked it very much, but I had anticpated the worst. The film was interpretated by David Yates excellently. Yes the were parts slightly out of context and bits missing from the books, but it had done its self justice. The three young main actors, have once again done brilliantly. The flashbacks of the past were great. The special effects were done well casting of luna. Lynch had the perfect look and voice, her expressions were like luna to a T. congrats to another great HP film."
1177,10,Best out of the five,"Without a doubt the best Harry Potter movie. OOTP captures the essence of the book and converts it into a movie that proves to be worthy of it's name. While I thought OOTP would follow GOF's footsteps, I was mistaken. OOTP is by far the best out of all the Harry Potter movies, and you shall not regret it if you watch it, it's well worth your time. Ignore that hag that said bad things about this movie, he's wrong. Daniel's acting has been at it's peak in this movie, he displays Harry perfectly, Emma-Hot as ever, Rupert-Classic comic relief. And no way this is a kid's movie."
1178,8,"The Book is better, But......","I did not care for the Movie as much as the book. However, having said that, I don't know how they could have put in enough to follow the book better. The movie seemed disjointed at first pass. They did not show very well how Harry was going through transition of becoming an adult. Just one shot of Harry showing his temper with class mates. There were many other sections missing that would have made more sense to the non book reader. Also the different segments did not have a smooth transition into or out of them."
1179,6,Good but something was missing,"I have to warn all that I am not pleased when a movie deviates from the book it is based upon. I realize it MUST to some extent, but I feel this time it went too far. The special effects were outstanding. The score was tremendous (as usual) and the film itself was a very well done work. I give credit to all who worked on and in this film."
1180,5,Rushed,"I couldn't help but feel as if the entire film was rushed, it varies from the book significantly along plot line's both major and minor. I found the order of the phoenix the most enjoyable book of the series however this film seemed to squeeze the life out of the book and utterly ignore a lot of the story. In the end the film just felt as if it was an excuse to throw together a few action scene's coupled with a lot of special effects. The final fight sequence is cut down to the bare minimum along with the Weasleys departure from Hogwarts which did not fully express the reaction of the people or the actions of the twins and a lot of the deeds that took place in the house of black seem to be completely overlooked."
1181,7,The Best film of the series- by far,"This is by no means an excellent film, but it remains committed to the book and the motive of Harry Potter. Finally we have a film that transcends a childlike attitude and actually allows a little imagination to run free. The end wasn't quite too scratch, but the bulk of the film more than makes up for this. This is a film for real Harry Potter fans, not just those that think by seeing a film they can make up for a lack of reading. Its important to remember that considering the book was over 600 pages long it would have been impossible to cover everything, but The Order of the Phoenix manages to distinguish between what is important and what is not."
1182,10,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"The Order of the Phoenix is definitely the best of the Harry Potter movies to date. It actually is one of the few movies I have seen that outdoes it's literary counterpart in developing and sustaining the arc of it's main character. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of J.K. Rowling and I have the entire collection; eagerly awaiting each one as it hits the bookstores. However in adapting J.K. Rowling's book, the screenwriter and director were able to truly capture the exact essence of the story and the dilemmas of it's characters while removing the unnecessary and the repetitive; something a good editor could have -and should have- done with the book. The movie was able to fully explore Harry's adolescent angst, anger and terrible losses without making him seem like a spoiled brat, as he often appeared in the book. The same can be said for the characterization of Sirius Black, who comes across as the Godfather that James and Lilly Potter would have chosen for their beloved son, rather than the self-absorbed and reckless character which came into focus in the book. I not only find both Harry and Sirius more likable in the movie, but also -and more importantly- they are more consistent with their previous characterizations and therefore more believable. The exploration of Luna Lovegood is equally impressive. The director allows us to see the absolute beauty and wonder in this character. Also, like Neville, we can see that this is someone from whom we can expect the unexpected. Someone who can understand Harry's deeper self. Someone who knows what it means to suffer loss. Yet, despite the the depth and darkness explored here, the movie moves along at an exhilarating pace with special effects that support the storyline rather than detract from it. There are none of the childish antics and visuals so typical of Chris Columbus in the earliest movies. This is a serious handling of an archetypal plot. While I would have liked to see more of Alan Rickman, Emma Watson, and Maggie Smith, among others, this focus on Harry was true to J.K. Rowling's vision. This is really Harry's story. More than any of the other books, this is the arc in Harry's development from child to young adult. Daniel Radcliffe does a fine job portraying this transformation and has developed into a fine young actor. As usual the casting of new characters is impeccable, with Imelda Staunton as the most wicked woman in pink the world has ever seen. Evanna Lynch is an absolute gem as Luna Lovegood! A most impressive movie. I find myself hoping that this screenwriter and director stay on for the next one."
1183,10,I agree,"As I said in my subject, I totally agree with you. Although, for some reason, I liked the 3rd and 4th movie better, I agree with everything you say concerning Order of the Phoenix. I know a lot of people complain of those who are picky about details, but this is not what it is about. I went to the movie feeling that it's was gonna be great and although as a whole the movie was good (Dolores Umbridge and Luna Lovegood were brought to life spectacularly) that was it, the movie didn't set ground for more. I do wish to add though that I'm extremely looking forward to the DVD release mainly because this film was edited after the Grindhouse flop in the box office due to fear of the movie being too long. I'm hoping that maybe, if an unedited release is made, I can finally see the movie I was hoping for to see all summer."
1184,10,Aweome!,"I think this was the best Harry Potter movie so far! The special effects were better than ever, Umbridge and Luna were great at their parents! She really was Luna, no one else could have done her."
1185,7,"Good movie, bad portrayal of book.","As an avid reader of the Harry Potter novels, I found this movie a terrible interpretation of the fifth book. I will at least give credit where it's due - as always, the casting for this movie was marvelous, the effects astounding. But I feel that they left out some very important information that would leave anybody trying to follow the storyline through movies alone in the dark. For example, the movie never explains who/what Aurors are, so leaving you to wonder why Shacklebolt and Tonks are even in the story at all."
1186,8,Wonderful movie if it wasn't for...,OK there are spoilers ahead if you haven't read the books or watched the movie so do please be warned: Having said that Great movie except one small but very powerful thing Bellatrix never Ever used the killing curse on Sirius in the books in fact it wasn't even the same colored spell the killing curse was a green spell every time it was used in the book when Sirius is taunting her it says she cast a spell at him with a red color to it (like stupify) and he fell back in to the curtain everyone thought he'd just land on the other side.. only he didn't... in the movie much to my shock and continuing annoyance she cast the killing curse on him and then he fell in to the curtain.
1187,7,it was OK .,"Personally being a huge fan of harry potter, and never has there been a book yet that i haven't read more than once, i found this film to be rather rushed and quite honestly too much."
1188,9,I really liked this movie,There were some parts u were like come on get on with it but the movie overall was amazing!!! Everybody has different comments about it because everyone has different tastes... so for my tastes the movie was really the best harry potter movie yet...... i loved the whole scene fighting part at the end.... Most of the book was in there... they could have added just a couple more parts.... Can't wait for the book to come out... Overall in my opinion this was a very very good movie!!!! The part where they all fought against the death eaters was the best part in the movie... the scene where voldemort came out was very good too... but the fighting then was only between voldemort and dumbledore.... so i wish harry would have fought a bit in that... but oh well....
1189,6,You Need to Read This!!,I must say that i thought this movie was semi-horrible and semi-okay!!
1190,8,Best Harry Potter yet!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This harry potter film contains action and suspense for viewers. This movie that has cut many scenes and condensed into a two hour and eighteen minute movie is well worth your while. This could have done a little better with adding some more details and action to make it even better than before. David Yates compared to the other directors is probably the second best directing the harry potter movies while Chris Columbus is number one in my opinion. Either way, this movie will excite you or give you the pleasure of not seeing it again. Anyways, see it for yourself and judge the movie in your own opinion if it was worth your money or just a waste."
1191,4,A disjointed hard to follow movie,"I'm a post-70 senior and I have been to all the Harry Potter films, usually taking younger family members and their friends. I found this movie (and the previous one)too fast, too disjointed and hard to follow. The chopping of the scenes was disconcerting, A smooth transition from scene to scene would have been welcome. I got the feeling the movie was cut to pieces to get it into a not-too-long-time frame. Hopefully these comments might improve the next one coming out."
1192,5,"A paradox, no doubt.","Longest book, shortest movie. Longest book, shortest movie. Longest book, shortest movie."
1193,2,The movie was very disappointing,"If you see this movie from outside the box, and not as a Harry Potter Fan, then yes, the movie was a good 2 hour and 18 minutes entertainment. But all the loyal Harry Potter fans have to be completely disappointed. As the series goes on, the movies have become very weak plotted and rushed. Very crucial details are missing. Storyline has changed, and it almost feels like these movies exist in different world than the books do. I walked out of the theater completely disappointed along with my friends, who are Potter crazy. We all thought that the movie was a disaster. The movie provides decent entertainment, if watched in Imax 3D. The enhancement of the picture is very good and worth a few bucks more. Watch this movie as a person who doesn't read Harry Potter books, and you will probably enjoy it more. The biggest book of the series is crunched in the smallest movie of the series? How fair is that? Warner Brothers have to think again, and make sure they deliver better product with the next two remaining movies."
1194,2,Harry goes Hollywood,"When the director, screenwriter and producers sat down and planned this film, something must have gone totally wrong. The essence of the book: Harry's loneliness, his fight against the Ministry and Voldemort's mind has been discarded or has been done poorly. The first three minutes were good(Daniel Radcliffe has changed dramatically) and gave me that very feeling of an eerie world. Sadly, that is where I lost track. The movie flies through the book's pages as if it was some kind of tabloid-newspaper without anything important to tell. And before you know it, Harry arrives at the ministry. As Harry battles his way to the final meeting between Dumbledore and Voldemort, we are served spectacular(!) effects, but sadly - thats about it."
1195,10,Best Harry Potter film yet!,"This film was a joy to watch. From scene one, David Yates had me glued to the screen. How did he do it? My guess is, that Mr Yates has an eye for real life, real people and real things. He moved me. Daniel seemed so much more relaxed in his role than previous films and Professor Umbridge was superb,excellent casting here. Michael Gambon goes from strength to strength displaying all the confidence of an experienced actor. The very feel of the film, visually and emotionally; combined concepts of possibility, the ordinary and the magical..awesome! So glad that you're directing the next film, Mr Yates!I will be watching this film again and again for years to come!"
1196,6,Could Have Been Better,"I am a longtime Harry Potter fan. I have read all the books and have seen all the movies. I was very disappointed with this one. I felt the movie's producer did not follow the book's format very well. While I understand that movies cannot tell the exact story from the book due to time constraints, I feel the movie could have been made a lot better. They left out some very crucial items that would have lended relevance to the plot. Maybe they're saving these aspects for the next movie, but I seriously doubt it. If I were JK Rowlings, I would be upset. I hope that a different producer and director are chosen for the next installment and that JKR has more say in how the story is adapted to the screen. I still hope for the best and will remain a Harry Potter fan despite this most recent film's poor quality."
1197,4,Disappointing,"Overall, disappointing. I understand the need to leave things out for the movie version. But, the drastic changes from the book and the HUGE amount left out was hard to swallow. Cho did NOT tattle on the DA. The DA was NOT Dumbledore's Army until near the end when they were found out. Umbridge did not break down the door to the room of requirement, Dobby ran in and told everyone she was coming and they all scattered. Umbridge never interrogated ALL the students with truth serum, only Harry. Hagrid's brother was not tame at all. And what the heck happened to Quiddich? And Harry's interview with the Quibbler?"
1198,4,Book is better than movie.,I was at 1st excited for the movie but then to realise... THEY CUT OUT SO MUCH. We have badly any character development compared to the book. Harry is a teenager now so why is Ron the only one who is moody? Everyone is great actors. Belitrix Lastrange has been done to perfection yet other characters not so much. Why did we miss the conversation across the wizard trio? This movie deserves to be rated this low. AND PLZ READ THE BOOK IT IS SO MUCH BETTER. Sure it's 800 pages but it is worth it.
1199,7,Even magic can take you by surprise..,"My little brother and myself went to see this movie yesterday. He's 15 and I am 31. We are both big Harry Potter fans. When we left the cinema we both looked at each other and sighed... it was not completely what we thought it would be... This movie should have been at least one hour longer!! Some story lines missed the attention they deserved.. Especially the lessons with Snape and off course the romance with Cho! OK.. they kissed and it was the talk of the day but after that nothing happens (in a good way) to explain why the romance didn't last. Well, the reason is explained but after that the movie doesn't mention it at all.. Hopefully in the next movie they will get back on the matter.. Our favorite books are the last three.. Yes, the last one is brilliant.. hopefully they make a 5 hour movie from that one..."
1200,6,Harry Potter 5 brief overview,"Harry Potter 5 was a good as a film, but its relationship to the book was terrible. It cut out too much main stuff, including Ginnys storyline almost entirely-she shouldn't be just in as an extra (she said roughly 5 words), and she deserves to be credited as a main character, as she is too important in the books to be cut out of the films. (As you can probably tell, I like Ginny) Harry and George's fight with Malfoy after the Quidditch match should have been in the film, as there was room for more stuff. The only people who really got any lines in the film were Harry, Ron, Hermione, Lucius Malfoy and Voldemort. Draco Malfoy should have had more than 1 or 2 lines, as again he is too important to be left out. The best scenes were the practise's in the room of requirement, they were the only bits with any look of effort (apart with Dumbledore and Voldemorts fight). I also enjoyed Fred and Georges escape and the scenes with Kreacher in (he was only in because Rowling walked up to Yatesey and told him to put Kreacher back into the script after him being omitted). This director did a decent job on HP4 but an absolutely abysmal job on this film, and I was gutted when i heard that he signed up for HP6. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film, as the good bits made up for the bits that were missed out (approx. half of the book) but Yatesey needs to do a better job on HP6 or the film will lose my vote."
1201,7,a bit disappointed,"As an educator and an avid reader, I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. When I was in college I had to read some middle level titles of my choosing for my middle level reading class and to my great fortune it was at the beginning of the Harry Potter series, not all the hype yet, just great books. I fell in love with these books not only because they are well written, but also because I saw my students fall in love with reading. I had a 7th grade student who was reading several grade levels below and hated reading. Once he was hooked on Harry Potter, it was impossible to get his nose out of any book. To me, that is the wonder of Harry Potter."
1202,6,Favorite book in series. Least favorite of the movies.,"The 5th installment of the Harry Potter series was undoubtedly my favorite, and I expected the movie to be just as good. I may have gotten my expectations way too high, thus leading to my disappointment in the film. From the Sorcerer's Stone to the Goblet of Fire, I thought the movies were steadily getting better, but the Order of the Phoenix brought that thought to a screeching halt. They skipped so much vital information that I expect the next two films will be nothing BUT explaining to make up for it. The dialogue didn't flow at all, nor was there any character development. I could go on and on, but I'm sure the other hundred or so comments summed it up perfectly for me. I just think I'll block the movie from my mind completely and hold on to my own idea of what it should have been like."
1203,,Where is the info on the Music Score Composer ???,"There is beautiful symphonic Music all throughout the movie but this info is nowhere to be found !!!!! I think you got this wrong, before aspect ratios and sound mix specs, it would seem rather I.M.P.O.R.T.A.N.T not to leave this detail unchecked ; after all the soundtrack's impact is only 50% of the Total experience !!! I am not talking about who made the sandwiches for the crew !!!! So please, be kind enough not just to give incidental details about a group of singers, but the FULL details of the Music score, from beginning to end. There are people who care to know about this more than if the aspect ratio is 1.33 x 1, 1.66 x 1, 1.85 x 1, 2.1 x 1 or such things. Before I get details about the ashtrays or the cigar lighter, I want to know about the engine of the car. Thanks for fixing it !"
1204,9,Stupified Me!,"I want to start out by saying that for every person that likes something, there are going to be 3 people that hate it. That is very much the case on IMDb, as it is also in the world. There are many negative reviews on this movie, going on about how so many things were cut out and out of order and blah blah blah... I, being a HUGE fan of the books, approached this film with an open mind. I knew things would be cut. I knew it wouldn't be exactly like the book (because if it was, the movie'd be 5 hours long). So I looked at it honestly, and it was really good."
1205,9,"great movie, better book","the movie was the shortest yet the book was the longest. that means there's something missing. Luna and Umbridge are great. Kreacher should have been more involved and the missing scenes from the book should have been included, although it is impossible to include all of them, then at least some of them. as a movie, i thought it was terrific and the whole thing was great, but because i read the book, it was very disappointing and did not live up to the standards of the book. the story was overflowing with potential yet the movie did not live up to it because it wasn't long enough. I'm hoping that down the road, someone else will be able to re-do these movies and make them more accurate with the events in the book, even if they are each more than four hours long. I'm curious to see what they do with the next two movies and i hope that they can make them longer."
1206,4,Regarding IMAX 3D and this Movie,"If you are excited about seeing this new Harry Potter title in the IMAX 3-D theaters I will let you in on something you might find helpful. Although the movie itself was well put together, the 3D portion did not start until nearing the end of the movie. So if you are considering a drive in order to see this in IMAX you may be disappointed, I drove approx. 1hour and I was not happy with the performance of the film's 3-D perspective. Please do not waist your gas, go to the local theater and then spend the extra gas going to get ice cream afterwards :-)....YAY! If you have questions regarding this movie in IMAX 3-D contact me at bbqpwn@hotmail.com -DJ-"
1207,4,"Nothing really happens, and what happens is not important","I really liked harry potter 1-4. Within this magical theme, i think HP is the absolute best and i would give 1-4 all 9/10.. However, i just came home from watching HP 5 in the cinema, and after years of using IMDb, this is the very first time i felt compelled to register and write a comment, This entire movie was rubbish. I did not read any of the books, so that's not why i have this opinion. I say this because it felt like i was watching a compilation of story twists placed in sequence to represent a movie. ..The storyline is jerky, with gaps everywhere...i thought this was a complete waste of time, and i really wanted it to be good. I can only hope the uncut version is better. If you have wanted this movie to be nice as well, go see Roald Dahls Mathilda. It is practically the same story, only much better compiled. ""I'm smart your dumb, I'm big your little, I'm right your wrong and there's nothing you can do about it!"""
1208,10,What a great movie,I am a big fan of Harry Potter and have seen every one of them and some several times. My husband and I went to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix IMAX version and it was wonderful. It felt like you were actually there at Hogwarts.I especially enjoyed the 3D portion of the film as it felt like you could actually reach out and touch the characters. My husband really isn't much of a fan but really liked this movie.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and would see it again myself.It was an action and adventure movie that was very thrilling for everyone regardless of their age.My only regret is that the series is almost over as their is only one book left. I hope that their is another movie in the works. Once again I really enjoyed the movie.
1209,8,The book is better,"I gave Harry Potter and the OOTP an 8 out of 10. It was very entertaining and exciting. If you love the books like I do and you have seen the movie, then you know that there is some differences. Personally, I like the book better, but they couldn't have made the movie all like the book or it would have been over four hours long. The new director did a very well job keeping the magic in this movie. Still,Chris Colombus(director of the first 2 Harry Potter movies)has first place in directing this series. "
1210,5,not the best harry potter film,"i must say i think this is the worse harry potter film i have ever seen.it has lost its magic ,have the film makers decided that they don't need to try so hard now that harry,the books etc have become such a hit,they know that everybody will go and see the film relentless of the reviews etc.didn't think there was enough action in this film took a long time to build up and then just as the pace increased the film was over,the capes etc have been replaced with jeans and trainers.some good acting,but becoming less magical as the main actors look like they should be at work not magic school,sorry harry but not so potty about you now,the end has come the actors are to old and i don't think anyone else could be harry,so farewell.go and see transformers a fantastic film edge of the seat stuff.how films should be."
1211,,"Liked It, But It Could Have Been Better!!","OK, first off I know this is just another somewhat useless comment about this movie, but here it goes anyway."
1212,,Hope for more out of the next two movies from the new director,"When I heard that the Harry Potter movies had taken on a new director because the last did not wish to proceed further, I approached the newest movie- Order of the Pheonix with hesitation. When I heard that the new director had not read the books I almost waited for it to come to video."
1213,8,"Best harry potter movie, but not perfect","Like fan harry potter (movies but principally books) I had the notion that this was the book more hard of adapting for movie (without the action of 4) but perhaps the best book and that what better transmits the ambiance "" harry potter "" .Of to the movie, has an entrancing beginning, the part in which harry and dudley are pursued by the dementors it is recreated well, to follow to that the movie loses some rhythm, and the scene in the court is perhaps the worst of the movie, the actor Michael Gambon is still very distant of what it is the Dumbledore, next the movie stays a little starting and has not half of the things of the book. The end is very well done in spite of not being the same to the book. Finally it are the most important of the movie that gets everything what the book is still important of in spite of less detailed, and more important, manages to recreate the ambiance of the books.positive interpretation of imelda staunton, it could not be better. the best movie Harry Potter even at the moment"
1214,10,Sensational. Best one so far - easily !,"I really don't understand some of these terrible comments ! Order of The Phoenix is EASILY the best Harry Potter film so far with real quality in every area. It was fast moving, funny, exciting, touching and quite frankly had far and away the best acting from the younger cast that has been seen up to now. The choices made by the Director of what to cut from the very long book, were smart and didn't destroy the story (for me) one bit. It flowed very well and the only thing it asked of the audience was that they had a little bit of knowledge of what had happened in the previous movies and that they just soak up the story as presented on the screen. David Yate's direction of the actors was superb, Nicholas Hooper's music wonderful, Tim Burke's special effects were truly spectacular and what I've read about Yates using a dance choreographer to devise the wand combat scenes was an inspired idea, as Paul Harris created exciting, artistic and graceful choreography for the wand duelling scenes. Those scenes were so thrilling that they will be one of the highlights of the entire series of Harry Potter films when they are all done and dusted. The kiss was handled brilliantly - given the massive age range of the audience it couldn't have been exploited any more and both actors pitched the scene perfectly. For me, David Yates has taken something by the scruff of the neck and made it totally thrilling. I kept falling asleep in the second film and was also bored by the fourth. The other films already seem dated to me, but the style of this will stand the test of time much more successfully. Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix is a really great film for Potter fans and Potter newbies alike."
1215,2,why did they let David Yates do this movie,"i agree with the last comment, the movie was way to confusing to understand. the people who made that movie did not know what they were doing, because if they did then it would have been a lot better, i wish i had seen transformers instead of harry potter 5 cause thats how bad it sucked. i hope the other harry potter movies are better then that cause if they aren't i'm going to cry."
1216,9,Great Movie,"The Order of the Phoenix was a wonderful representation of the fifth installment to the Harry Potter series. Unlike its predecessor, which was a bit choppy at the beginning, it flowed a lot better, making the movie less confusing for the audiences who didn't read the book."
1217,4,Certainly not a bore.,"The movie has around 30% of the book. They miss a lot of the interesting things such as the wizard sport, St. Mungo's (definately would've wanted to see a wizard hospital), and detail. In the book things progressed slowly and in the movie these things were introduced in whichever way seemed easiest. Like for example when Harry sees Mr. Weasley's attack, he goes to #12 Grimauld place then finds out Dumbledore wants him to learn mind-closing, in the movie after he sees the attack he goes to Dumbledore's office, somehow Dumbledore knew about it before Harry told him, and somehow he called Snape, and after he comes he drags Harry to his office to teach him mind-closing and another weird thing, how did they end up in Grimauld place? nothing makes sense, and in the movie, why did Cho be the sneak and there was no Marrieta? And why were there no acne on Cho's face? And the way Umbridge found out about the DA in the movie was pretty stupid."
1218,5,It could have been much better!,"To start with, if I hadn't read the book, the movie would still not be rated a 10, maybe a 6. The scenes happened way too fast. The whole movie reminded me of an extra long advertising trailer."
1219,1,Manipulating trash,"Stupid way to manipulate young peoples' brains by showin dem tings dat don't exist. ""Harry Potter is a hero!"" -> what did he do to be a hero?!?! They teach us to think that everything could be just given to us and that we don't have to do anything about it. (like Ratcliff had a chance) Well mates, I don't think dat dis happens to every 18 year old boy, does it? The result is dat you have a future generation of lazy people all over the globe, easy to manipulate. Nice, isn't it?! So we can only pray dat some of us read between the lines and see behind the curtain to realise what's the real purpose (except the money of course)of all this trash named Harry Potter..."
1220,8,"Harry Potter, a great series of movies","I have liked all the Harry Potter movies that have come out so far. Because of all the detail in the book it probably should have been turned into two movies so they could go into detail and not feel so rushed. The character of Dumbldore was a disappointment, needs a better actor like Ian McKellan or Peter O'Tool, but my favorite characters did not disappoint. Fred and George Weasley. The best! The music in the Harry Potter movies have always been good. I enjoy listening to the end credits because the music is so good. Until the 5th movie. I'm sorry but the music didn't really fit. It didn't have the lilt that draws you in like the other movies did. I really hope they go back to having John Williams do the music."
1221,5,Too flashy,"The film did no justice to the book. It would have served as a good synopsis of the novel, summarizing some of the main ideas that follow through, like the DA, but it lacked all the filling which JKR put so much into. Flashing back and forth between incidents and the DA took away from its plot-building, suspense-building, viewer-catching potential. Makes the video very hollow, and disappointing. Perhaps it should have allowed a little more attention be given to the other parts, especially where concepts come up later as important pieces. (See goofs/FAQ for more details). The parts it did include, though, were good."
1222,6,Better than the book,"I read the Harry Potter book and was disappointed with it, everyone seemed so angry... I was also becoming bored with the movies, especially the goblet of fire."
1223,3,xxx,"The series of Harry Potter always seem to be enjoyable and charming. However, this installment is rather quite gloomy. Hermione is portrayed as a powerful and intelligent witch, but most of her skills are rarely used against forces of evil. Most oh the time, she relies on Harry or someone else to rescue her as if she is in trouble. Dude, what is the use of being so talented if all the heroism is reserved for the male characters? Moreover, the character- Cho Chung's act makes me even more disappointed. She is ""well-known"" for her erotic mind. There is hardly a scene that she is not throwing herself into Harry and kissing him. She is such a filthy woman that she betrayed Harry(her beloved boyfriend) and give up to Malfoy who gaged her. All in all, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix exists to whet our appetite. It is such an eyesore that I strongly recommend all of you not to dare to glimpse it."
1224,3,A joke for true HP fans,"When the trailer for this ""movie"" came out before Happy Feet I was excited beyond reason. Then when I saw the movie I almost threw up! This is seriously the worst HP movie ever made and that's saying something after the disaster of the first two movies. Being a true HP fan since 1999 I can say that the only movies that do any justice to the books are POA ad GOF. Yates took a lot liberties with the movie and made every single character one dimensional. He has taken a great franchise and killed it. I'm sorry if you liked this movie but being a true HP fan I hated it (except for a few parts) but the overall movie stunk. I would personally like to see Alfonso Cuaron back for the final chapter but rumors are going around that Yates is coming back and I personally don't like him if he screws HBP as bad as he did OOTP Warner Bros. Should fire him and bring in a component director."
1225,5,Read The Book,"If you haven't read the book u might think its a good movie but... no. The story was changed completely, and not the good way. A lot of things were left out and a lot was added... for example, harry never heard the prophecy, and he never gives it to Lucius... One thing that really annoyed me was the fact that every time someone fought the wands would get atached, like they did in the 4th move when voldemort attacks Harry, that is not supposed to happen, it only happened before because Harrys and Voldemorts wand were made with the same phonexs fethers. There are a lot of more stuff that buged me but you should better read the book, even tho you already saw the movie. Oh and sorry for the bad spelling and grammar =S"
1226,5,How could you make a mistake like this...,"OK, the film isn't terrible, but it's certainly very rushed and aims at spitting out yet another film on schedule, rather than making it epic. There was one absolute major flaw with the script though, and I can't actually believe the producers were ignorant enough to miss it out... How could you possibly neglect the Harry - Dumbledore scene in his office at the end? Arguably one of the most emotional parts in all 7 books??? I wasn't hugely impressed with the ministry part, but I didn't care, I was waiting for that scene. What I got was a few meaningful seconds of it, in fact it was practically a transition. Here was one of the best chapters in all the books, and what did they do? They used it to quickly transfer from one scene to the next... For a moment I almost thought it was a joke, and that they'd return to the scene."
1227,8,OotP disappointment,"I was VERY upset with the 5th installment of Harry Potter. I have been reading these books in a matter of days ever since they came out and have always had a great deal of excitement when I saw a new book or movie out. When I went to see OotP I was very disappointed. I was expecting an uber long film with detail about EVERYTHING instead we got a choppy 2 hour version of a (i'm going to guess and say) 800 page book. I hated how they cut out scenes and used the newspaper to give the audience information about scenes that weren't ""good enough"" to make the movie. I was very disappointed."
1228,5,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not good enough,"WARING: IF YOU'VE ALREADY READ THIS BOOK, YOU'D BETTER NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE."
1229,2,"Not the worst film ever, but close.","Although the actors all did very well (I was quite pleased to see the excellent Carter in the role of Bellatrix) in all, I was very disappointed with the movie and it actually makes me not really care about the next, unless it gets some really amazing reviews. I'm a big fan of the books, of course, and although I realise that movies can not completely duplicate printed works, I was incredibly disappointed by this one. I don't know if it was stupidity on the part of the director or if it was just laziness, but even someone clueless about the film industry can tell what parts of the book have the potential to be legendary on film. For example, Dumbledore blasting the heck out of the ministry trying to defend himself would have added quite a notch to Gambon's belt. The twins' famous exit from Hogwarts (a part in the book that encouraged the reader to repeat it over and over just for those pages) could have been one of the most hilarious and glittery part of the whole series to date. Most importantly, the climax of the movie, the raid on the Ministry of Magic and the subsequent battles, could have been absolutely stunning. Instead, we are given one room with a doorway and some ripped up cloth. Goodness, even the book jacket was more vivid and exciting than the climax of this movie. Then we are given an out-of-character Dumbledore battling Voldemort in an empty hallway. The whole beauty of Rowling's books is the sheer imagination that went into this series, and all the film has to offer is a couple of empty rooms? What happened to the spinning rooms, the brains, the hummingbird, the smashed cabinet, and all those other magical items? And what about Harry's little speech to Voldemort in the film which runs something along the lines of, ""You can't win because I have friends!""? I don't know what hack wrote the script for that one, but as far as dramatic moments go that one pretty much fails as it just made members of the audience stifle laughter. There were some ""ooh, aah"" moments, but it wasn't nearly enough to save this movie. What should have been the masterpiece so far became a laughingstock. Had the director added 45 minutes and actually read the book, it would have been said masterpiece. Even just an extended version of the final battles would have made it more impressive (though it would not have saved it) because at least people would have left the theater feeling satisfied that there was at least a climax in the story. This is a movie I will not even purchase, and such a disappointment that I have lost all desire to see the next movie since it is directed by the same guy. One would think that having been handed such a vivid story, the director would find it hard to screw it up. Boy, I sure hope you don't screw the next one up."
1230,8,third time lucky,"when i first saw this movie in the cinemas i thought it was the worst harry potter movie yet, being a reader of the books. they seemed to cut out almost every memorable scene in the movie or else change them into boring digital effects. whats more characters that should have been given more detail we were just given glimpses of, e.g. tonks and Bellatrix. tonks was only given about 1 or 2 lines and if you hadn't read the book you probably wouldn't'even know her name as you never clearly hear her called tonks, just""don't call me nymphadora"", she didn't even say ""wotcher harry"" which is kind of like her trademark greeting. Bellatrix was played perfectly by Helena Bonham carter but same as tonks she just wasn't given enough to do. dumbledore as usual since Richard Harris (who played dumbledore in the first two movies) passed away had me angry watching him because he is the worst possible dumbledore they could have chosen. he is uncharacteristically angry and aggressive all the time, i still haven't gotten over how he violently shoved harry after reading his name out of the goblet of fire. still he's not as bad when watched over. after watching the movie on DVD a second time i still hated it. but i watched it a third time recently and decided to try and forget all i had read in the book. now it is my favourite of all the potter movies. its dramatic, exciting, funny, and action packed. two new characters i think really saved this movie and that was umbridge and Luna lovegood. they were both perfectly played and were exactly as i imagined down to the last detail.the DA club was done well, and even though it was cho who dobbed them all in, i didn't really mind as i don't really care if cho is hated. Fred and George's exit was great, just as it should have been. kreacher was excellent but still should have had the big role he had in the book but i'm just happy he was shown at all. the thestrals were made excellently. the final battle was good as long as you don't compare it to the book, which was much more dramatic and heart pounding. this movie was simply put superbly made and shouldn't be missed by fans, no matter what bad reviews some book lovers write."
1231,,Another Amazing HP film,"I think that David Yates, the director, did an amazing job of keeping the Harry Potter theme going and did the book a wonderful justice. It can not be easy taking a book that is 870 pages down to a 138 minute film even with some assistance from the author J.K Rowling. "
1232,8,Excellent Movie,"I loved the movie, regardless of many uptight interpretations on the content of the movies, which I will not rant upon at this time. Umbridge was cast so well that I wanted someone to torture her with a whats-it-called crucio curse. I would have laughed. Bellatrix was so good that I actually admire both the actress and the character. Harry is such a courageous and tortured character that we should take a leaf from his book, fictional or not. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint (I always get a giggle from his name) were as outstanding as Daniel himself. The three of them were a brilliant casting from the start, an amazing work of intuition on the part of those that chose them. The movie, all in all, was fascinating and emotionally charged. The humor was great, as well as the effects were astounding. I would have loved to have seen it in the theater, but I was forced to wait *very impatiently* for the DVD to come out, and after watching it I bought a copy for all of the Harry fans in my family. I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a great good vs evil storyline that evolves over time."
1233,9,Review,"Let me just say that I have been constantly impressed with the work that is done by the Harry Potter movies' cast and crew. Their improvement has shone brightly throughout the saga. I was especially impressed with the scene at the Ministry of Magic where Sirius is killed. Daniel Radcliffe's emotion is fantastic and the music and sound editing is spot on. I love how its in slow motion and mute for part of the scene, and then transfers smoothly into sound and movement. I also was impressed in a scene shortly after that where Harry is being possessed by Voldemort and he is laying on the ground, watched by Dumbledore. Yet again, Daniel Radcliffe provides emotion and dynamics."
1234,,Fred and George,"I like the movie and I've seen it several times. But I find it more interesting to read the book. When I read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, apart from Harry, Ron and Hermione, the ones who impressed me most was Ron's twin brother----Fred and George. They always made me burst into laughter. Admittedly, they really had senses of humor. They were troublemakers, who enjoyed themselves in doing things deviated from the normal way. They didn't like people who follow rules docilely. In their views, only the one who was stupid or mad that wanted to be a prefect. Therefore, when a Prefect badge was conferred on Ron, they were incredulous and surprised the moment they heard the news. ""There's been a mistake. No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect""Fred said. And George said indignantly to Harry, ""We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you"", as thought Harry had tricked them in some way. After they were convinced that it was true, they began to sneer at Ron. And George thrust the Prefect badge back at Ron as if it might contaminate him. How lovely they are!I think it's a pity that the director didn't mention it at all in the movie. What's more, they were always materializing out of thin air in front of other people with two loud cracks, which made others jump. And they usually disappeared out of other's view in the twinkling of an eye. Besides, I really appreciate their creative intelligence. They showed a talent for inventing magical things, such as Extendable Ears and Portable Swamp. They are genius!"
1235,7,What i thought about this movie was,"The book was overall awesome. I thought the movie wasn't that great. Half and half. I'm reading Half blooded prince and love it. Harry potter is a great grand tale of magic and friendship along the way. You never expect what's going to happen. If you liked the movies then i'd think you'd bound to love the books. I use audio tape and read the book while listening. :] that probably sounds crazy but, hey. That's what i do. I can't wait for the next movie and i'm flabbergasted that they made the last movie in Part 1 and 2. I was so happy. I was like about time. One more thing i'd like to say. Harry Potter books keep the fans turning the books nonstop."
1236,8,Order of the Best,"At first, while ongoing euphoria around me of the Harry Potter series was at the peak, I didn't watch any of the films because I had a little aversion towards them, cos I thought they were another ''make a lot of money film''. I read all the books of course and they were pretty good because of the mysterious atmosphere and really good plot. When finally I watched movies, I can say they are more than decent adaptation's of the J.K. Rowling's book, although I prefer the books. What makes the movies great is at first brilliant cast. Severus Snape is the best ''felt'' character, Gary Oldman was as always brilliant. Jason Isaacs is actor who surprised me the most with his role as Lucius, especially after I heard that he pretty much redesigned the character. These are the three actor's who impressed me the most with Alan Rickman as the the best actor in all five movies and I'm sure he'll do excellent to the end. All in all, I wouldn't say they're not a masterpiece's, far from it actually, but never the less terrific movies."
1237,8,Pretty good... but slight let downs ruined it.,"Order Of The Phoenix was my favourite of the Harry Potter books (bearing in mind that Deathly Hallows is not yet out) -- having said that, two of my favourite parts weren't in the movie."
1238,10,On second thought...,"Actually, I only registered to give my first voting ever. I just finished watching this movie (and reading the book) for the second time and I am very impressed. I am an avid book reader and among the fiction books I've read all of the Harry Potter books. The first time I saw the movie I was bothered by the changes they made to adapt the book to the screen - but this time around, a couple of years later, I noticed what great work the screen writer did! Even though certain events happen at different times or they made slight changes to the plot, it catches the atmosphere and every vital part of the story (and still fits it into 2 1/2 hours). I guess the time brought the wisdom and I was open to the movie without constantly thinking what happened in the book in the exact time. Let's be honest, why watch a movie which is basically the book acted out - every line, every movement... It would be like listening to a professor who tells everything word by word that is written in the textbook which, by the way, you have already read. Besides, the cinematography is excellent as well as the music, the camera movement, the actors (I would have loved to see Miss McGonagall more often)... I thought I am not going to write this but I don't seem to be able to keep my mouth shut: This is a awesome and a very good quality movie (the best in the series so far) which is far above certain other, totally over-hyped movies that occupy the screens right now (that is no dig at the people watching those or the fuss everybody makes about it - it is about the lack of quality).

1239,2,David Yates destroys Harry Potter books,"Harry Potter is a name almost any one will recognize. Whether they were fans of the books, the movies, both or neither, everyone knows Harry. I myself love the books and have memorized the movies, but this installment in the Harry Potter movies really put me off the movies. It's not the acting or the effects it is I have to say the director's fault entirely that this movie bombed so badly. David Yates chopped the book up so badly that the story was hard to recognize. Making the longest book into the shortest movie may have sounded like the right thing to do for David, but honestly what kind of idiot does that? It only makes since that the longest book would of course be the longest movie also. But sadly that is not the case. David Yates you have ruined The Order of the Phoenix. I was looking forward to my favorite book also being my favorite movie, but no. And when I discovered that he was directing the last 3 movies I gagged. The Half-Blood Prince wasn't as bad as it's predecessor, but it wasn't what it could or should have been. I am eagerly anticipating the last two movies in the series, although I most certainly will not be holding my breath that it will be everything it needs to be to satisfy, not only me, but every Harry Potter fan in the world."
1240,6,"Great movie, but...","Yes I know the books are not scripts, and all movies have to trim content to keep them from being too long, or because some director wants to ""improve"" them. In Order of the Phoenix the thing I noticed is that Luna Lovegood was not barefoot, due to the theft of her shoes, except for one scene in the woods with Harry. She should have been unshod for pretty much the whole story. This avoided several small sub-plots so perhaps that's why they did it. I also would have appreciated less low speaking, and more enunciation. Lots of the dialog is difficult to make out. And of course while integral to the feel of the story, would it have killed them to lighten up the exposure a bit? Difficult to make out the dark clothed kids against the dark shadowed background!"
1241,9,on the music and other stuff,I rarely notice the music in films but I did with the last 3 potter films.
1242,6,Focuses more on conflicts than characters,"For me, this was a huge disappointment. The other reviewers talking about how the movie lost its sense of magic and wonder are absolutely right. Take the effect that Steven Spielberg creates in his movies and reverse it, and you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about."
1243,3,Harry Potter needs new director!,"I agree that is difficult to do a film from a long book, but it isn't impossible; the proof is The Lord of the Rings."
1244,6,Needed to be 3 hours,"I struggling to think of a reason this couldn't have been 3 hours long. Would it really have impacted the budget significantly to flesh it out a little more? Maybe the studio have realised that it'll turn over squillions of dollars no matter how drastically the source material is disregarded or changed. It's a case of ""get it out the door as quickly as possible before the younger characters don't look so young anymore, bearing in mind there's 2 more episodes to get into the can"" If King Kong had been treated like this the first 5 minutes would have played out something like this: ""Oh Mr Denham, there's so little work going around in New York in these depressed days""....""OK, come film a movie with me about a mysterious island""....Cuts to boat rowing ashore...steamer in background....""What's that moving the trees over there?"" Not quite the same build up somehow. That's how this movie felt for me: We were seriously shortchanged."
1245,3,David Yates,"David Yates is destroying the world of Harry Potter. He sacrifices way too much important information to be the shortest Harry Potter movie there is which is what he wanted for reasons beyond my comprehension. Why would you want to take the longest and most informative book and chop it into fragments that go so quickly that you can't follow what is happening. I was one who said ""you shouldn't compare it to the books because its supposed to be entertaining"" but there is nothing entertaining about choppy story lines and not being able to let the death of Sirius sink. The scene was cut so short that I didn't have a moment to feel anything about it. He didn't give enough attention to the fact that Sirius was so important to Harry and that it will affect how the rest of his life will be. The fight in the Ministry was hardly given justice and was supposed to be the biggest part of the whole movie, its what everyone was excited to see. I love everything Harry Potter but I could have gone my whole life never watching this movie."
1246,8,"The same, yet refreshingly different.","I went to the cinemas today with the lowest expectation and surprisingly, I found myself LOVING EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of OOTP. I guess it's because out of all the directors(Columbus, Cuaron and Newell), Yate's approach towards the book/movie appealed to me the most and I find his direction the most interesting yet."
1247,6,"Coming of 4 straight above average films, the order of the phoenix fails to wow","The Harry Potter franchise, as believed by popular culture, has taken the world by storm and has changed a generation of viewers. I beg to differ. After 4 straight above average films, you would obviously expect things to keep steady. I personally found the Goblet of Fire one of the most action filled of the first 6 installments of the franchise. I regrettably say that the Order of the Phoenix is definitely one of the most dull and forgettable installments of Harry Potter. With a wondering story-line a little more challenging to understand for viewer's who have not read the book, it failed to wow in a way a Harry Potter movie should. Still a passing grade, just no push to wow a significant audience. 6 out of 10"
1248,10,Fresh Harry Potter!,"Before I critisise the acting, please know that this is a very artistic film! The scenery and sets were beautiful clashed with brilliant cinematography. See, I know nothing about those sort of things, but it was quite noticeable. This film had a different aura. Luna (Evanna Lynch) was so phenomenal that I hardly paid attention to Ron and Hermione, except when Emma did weird things with her line and when Rupert was whispering... And Cho made me grimace. She didn't act really natural...just heavy sorrow without the refreshing release of tears. I felt sorry for Harry. As usual, Snape was sensationally sardonic. I just wish that McGonagall would have followed his example like in the book. Minor characters did subtle things that were HILARIOUS. Imelda S. did well with Umbetch. Loathsome. I didn't like Helena though - she cackled too much. Anyway, the last battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort had tremendous impact. Muuuch better than Priori Incantem in GoF. Dan Rad was incredible! He made me cry with the last scene at the Ministry. I was so much more aware of how powerful and merciless Voldemort was on Harry's mind. All Harry's insecurities were made clear. Abd the way his memories played made me so nostalgic. I would've really liked the Weasleys to explain about Percy...or at least so SOMETHING productive at Grimmauld place. The film was super funny, though! Kingsley and Flitwick, with their subtlety, were great! And it felt like a real movie. Not just a year inside Hogwarts, but there was the real world that Harry talked about...I guess it felt more hazardous and genuine because Voldemort came back at the end of GoF. He was waiting for Harry and being a burden. Voldemort didn't appear on the back of someone's head underneath Hogwarts, as a memory and Horcrux hidden in the school, and he didn't just threat Harry with the return of a Death Eater. He didn't bring Harry against his will this time, not exactly. Harry felt a bigger sense of protection and love, of course. He wasn't a coward...he'd barge into the Department of Mysteries after class. And the DA helped his friends feel more confident and ready to face the real world. And the real world has issues in which Muggles struggle with as well, war, incompetent governments...in this case, the Ministry would not accept the truth because of fear. The film did a good job of showing that. "
1249,10,I loved this movie.,"A darker movie as it was a darker book than the previous ones. It reminded me of Tim Burton's work. I especially loved Dolores Umbridge, who is deliciously wicked in pink. She is spot on for inspiring fear by merely looking as if she was the ubiquitous middle-class housewife righteous do-gooder. The evil she does is all the more evil just because she does it in the name of law and society (albeit it is a magical society). Another wonderful character is Luna Lovegood. Her blonde spaciness is delightful as she reinforces the fact that one cannot judge from surface appearance. She is more spot on with things than others give her credit for. My regrets include that the movie was not longer and so many great scenes from the book were not on the screen."
1250,8,This movie was all about Harry,"That's what the director (Yates) wanted the movie to be. I'm about half way through the book and have now seen the movie... so I have a half and half perspective. Thus far the book has been intriguing, and I believe Yates is right the movie should be about Harry and his struggle. Meaning if it doesn't impact Harry directly then it will be left out. No time to develop side stories and characters."
1251,7,Ehh it was good but disappointing at the same time...,*******SPOILERSSS*******
1252,9,better than the last,"While it will never be possible for any of the later films to be as true to the books as the first two (dont forget that the first two were less than 300 pages and the last several have been well over 600) I think that this movie does a good job of keeping to the story line. When a book is as beloved, and yes even as obsessed over, as these books are, there are always going to be those people that are disappointed when the minute details that make the story books what they are are not included in the movie. Overall, it is really well done and they managed to get much more of the main story line into this film than the last. The cinematography is wonderful and the acting is getting better every time. As the main characters grown up and their acting becomes less forced, the movies continue to evoke the essence of the written characters. The ensemble cast including such British greats as Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson really brings these films past the children's films that I think that many adults think of them as and into an entirely new genre. Our grandparents had the Lord of the Rings and this generation has Harry Potter. Well worth seeing."
1253,7,Getting there,"If your not a Harry Potter fan like myself and just get dragged to the cinema by your girlfriend on a wet Sunday afternoon on the hope of seeing Transformers or The Simpsons Movie, don't be too upset. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, isn't that bad. After leaving the previous 22 ( or 4, i can't remember) Harry Potter films with tears in my eyes and a numb arse, I was happy to see that they are getting better as the characters grow up. The films are getting Darker with more action and story lines are starting to take shape. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson are starting to act now and this for one make watching the film a whole lot easier. Well worth watching if you have nothing better to do, and if you start flagging near the middle of the film, just think of Daniel in his hilarious Extras Role."
1254,,time-line plot hole,"I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out or not but during ""Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix"" there was a mistake. Though a small mistake, storyline wise it was actually quite big. You see the whole story starts in 1981 when Harry was just over a year old and so at the beginning of this film when harry's supposed to be 14 going on 15 it would be 1995 not 2007, so how come in the common room scene you could hear ""boys will be boys"" by ordinary boys. This song was not around in 1995. This is to me a big plot hole. Hope you don't find me too sad for noticing, but to a book reader there are bits were the time-line is mentioned more than in the film and surfice it to say that when the last film is done the none book readers will suddenly click to such a mistake."
1255,10,An okay movie.,"I am a big fan of the books. I love the books. I grew up with them. The movie was good but it wasn't more than that. It was missing so much from the book. I understand that you have to cut some things out, when the book is so long. But the movie didn't do the book justice. I think the director spent too much time on showing DA, and showing scenes that we didn't need to see. Where was the Weasley is our king song? Where was angry!Harry in the end in Dumbledore's office? I did like Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, and the scene with her and Harry at the end was awesome."
1256,10,harry... new changes at his life...,"After witnessing Cedric Diggory's death, Harry Potter is worried that things could get worse.As they arrive at Hogwarts they find out that Dolores Umbridge is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She gives false information such as denying Lord Voldemort's return. When Harry tries to say that Voldemort has returned, she gives him detention and makes him write ""I must not tell lies"" repeatedly. She gives him a quill that engraves the words into his left hand. She later sacks Professor Trelawney and tries to banish her, but is stopped by Professor Dumbledore, who tells Professor McGonagall to escort Trelawney back inside. When Umbridge begins to argue about his actions, Dumbledore tells her that she has the right to sack teachers but she can't banish them from the grounds. At the same time, Dumbledore distances himself from Harry, knowing that Harry's mind is connected to Voldemort and can see visions of Voldemort when he gets a big emotionally charge such as happiness or anger.And a lot od different things happinig in harry's life to the end of the history."
1257,9,Sequels!!!!,"OK I have a real problem with sequels which is when seen all together (say matrix trilogy) they are very good. But I, like most people watch them as they are released, and 99% of the time the second one is nothing more than setting the scene for the last one. So you get 90 minutes of build up, build up, and more build up, and then......wait six bloody months for the next one to be released. Now I know what you're thinking ""but that's the whole point of a trilogy"" and so it is but, (and this is where The order of the Phoenix shines) you can have a strong sub plot so at the end you can go ""wow I want to see the next one, AND this one didn't seem unfinished"""
1258,8,A fantastic movie,"Saw this recently and loved every minute, the pacing and attention to detail by David yates is awe inspiring, the best film by an absolute mile. Daniel Radcliffe on previous efforts didn't really perform but in this movie he is fantastic, the best of the bunch by a long shot and hit the beats so well, particularly when he confronts Dumbledore in his office."
1259,7,Good technical aspects!,"The technical aspects are a step down as well in comparison to the previous two chapters, at least. It looks remarkably average in every department, except the performances which I will talk about next. And even the score by Nicholas Hooper doesn't manage to evoke any sort of feeling. Still there are few moments that's well captured & captivating but for the majority of its runtime, Order of the Phoenix remains very stale & adds nothing special to the franchise."
1260,10,"Harry's back, and we're loving every minute of it!","The 5th movie is the best rendition of book-to-movie in the Harry Potter series since The Chamber Of Secrets, though there is a whole emotional level missing to it, admittedly. Daniel Radcliffe has exceeded himself once more as an actor, as have his co-stars Watson and Grint. A general round of applause for the effort made, and hopes that The Half-Blood Prince will be better yet still! (the following paragraph contains a few spoilers!) As a character, it is nice to see Harry fight back not only Voldemort, but all those who do not believe him. It's also nice to see Radliffe's portrayal of (his) fame-winning character truly portray the frustrations that Potter is feeling. He'll win an Oscar yet (the actor, not the character)! The fifth begins the most interesting arc of the series yet: the truth coming through and being explained. A shame that Harry's scene in Dumbledore's office after the battle has not only been toned down but mostly cut. A shame, but still a good movie; a must-see!"
1261,6,This one's for fans of the books only,"I attended a screening last night with my Wife who is an avid fan and has read all the books several times. I must admit that I have not, but I have seen all the other films in the series and for the most part really enjoyed them all."
1262,8,"Good movie, not the best...","I liked the movie, but as expected, LOTS were left out. The plot was choppy at times and the thing that got me was that it was the shortest of the 5 so far...yet the longest book!! I can say I'm not at all happy w/the director of this movie...However, the new characters introduced were portrayed very well! Umbridge was awesome, and I hated her even more now that I saw her in the movie! LOL. Luna Lovegood was portrayed very nicely...as being the weirdo that she was portrayed to be in the book. Although she gave you the sense of being sweet and loving. I loved her character. I wish we could have seen more of Tonks!! It was nice to finally meet her character too...but we didn't get to see much of her! In fact, they only had 2 segments of the order in the whole movie! Um, what's the title of the movie again?? LOL. My favorite character, however, was Bellatrix Lestrange. Even though you see her for a short time, her character was AWESOME! She's everything I expected her to be...Mean, horrible, nasty, etc. For some reason, I pictured her totally differently in the book, but in the movie, it was nice to put a face to a name. Helena Bonham Carter is PERFECT for that role! Overall, a good movie, but left out WAY too much, which just left the plot choppy and unorganized at times..."
1263,2,disappointing even with no expectations,"After reading so many negative reviews of this movie here, I didn't hold any expectation when I went to the cinema today. But still, I am disappointed. It really is a movie which make you always ask yourself ""what is going on?"" You just cannot follow the plot! It's so badly written For example, all of a sudden it mentions ""deatheaters"". Luckily I have read the book, or else, I would not know what that means. Throughout the movie, I always have to ask my friend who had just read the book again a few days ago questions. Its kind of embarrassing for me and disturbing for my friend."
1264,8,The best film of them all.,"I saw this film last night, and i must say it it the best directed and the best acted of all the films. For those of you that have read the books, A lot of things are cut out, i.e. Rons Quidditch. The time spend in grimmauld place is minimal, being at most around 5 minutes, which i felt could have been extended. The story moves very quickly, and i found myself wondering whether i would have a clue what was going on if i hadn't read the books. This film spent longer on character development than the last film, which helped slow down the fast pace of the movie, however, whole chapters in the book were put into 5 seconds snapshots in the movie, and then moves to the next scene."
1265,8,"Excellent movie, if you forget the book","This is an excellent movie with excellent action scenes, excellent visual effects and a simply marvelous cast."
1266,10,"Great magical effects, A must see","You can not possibly take a 3"" novel and expect to see all the the amazing moments in a two-hour movie. I think the effects during the magic scenes are well accomplished. I wish Ron had more parts, as he is funny and he is not displayed that much in this movie. I would not miss any HP movies or books as I enjoy the verbal and visual HP entertainment. Wish List: I wish the producers could encompass pertinent scenes and possibly consider a double feature. This will allow people to use the facilities and then come back for the second feature. Theatre's could charge for two movies and the fan's would get a superior product."
1267,8,"Best film since ""Azkaban""",I have only read the first two books of the Harry Potter series so I can judge the later movies by what they are.
1268,3,The worst harry potter movie,"The worst movie at all. Almost nothing in common with the book. Yates adds so many unnecessary scenes from himself and cut so many important moments... I'm very disappointed and hope next one will be better. I've read the book so many times (all the books actually) and for me ""Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" are not good enough. I really like ""The goblet of fire"" and I expected that this one will be as good as the previous. In my opinion the director this time failed.In some moments I was even bored.Unbelievable! And where is the Quidditch ???I haven't seen this since a short scene from ""The prisoner of Azkaban"". The Quidditch plays big part in the 5th book, as it gave Ron the chance to shine. Griffindor wins the quidditch cup and Ron is their hero. I really miss this scene. I'm sorry we don't see more of Rupert Grint(Ron) and Bonnie Wright(Ginny) in this film. Also we barely see Alan Rickman (Snape), but we do see long boring scenes with Evanna Lynch(Luna) like the one in the end. Also there is no Christmastime hospital scene, no Longbottom's parents, no Lockhart. I forgot to say the way that everybody can see the Room of Requirement is ridiculous. Dobby finds this room for Harry, not Nevil.A person can only enter this room when they have a real need for it and pass 3 times around.And Kreacher?He doesn't looks so bad in the movie,but in the book he goes to Malfoy, and he betrays Sirius. These are just a few examples..."
1269,7,"Good Movie, Phenomenal Book!","The movie was OK. It was rushed and choppy from the beginning to around halfway through the film. The second half, in terms of editing and pace, was a lot better."
1270,10,Amazing characters and good graphics.,This movie is one of the 8 Harry Potter movies ever. Except for Delorus Umbridge and the Ministry of Magic (Cornelius Fudge) who are the most hated characters ever.
1271,8,"Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and You-Know-Who is back!","I saw this movie last night, and thought it was great! The writers did an excellent job of condensing and adapting JK's colossal novel, and kept the essence of the book alive. Though it may be slightly confusing for people who have not read the book, as there are a few little things that there just isn't time to explain in the running time. My main quibble is that much-loved characters, like Mr and Mrs Weasley, Professer Lupin, Mad-Eye-Moody and Tonks don't get much screen time, and are missed. The structure also feels a little uneven at times, but the movie is never boring. The older cast are, of course, excellent - especially Alan Rickman as slimy Professer Snape and Ralph Fiennes as evil Lord Voldemort. But what really impressed me was how mush the acting of the three leads has improved - Daniel Radcliffe really made me feel Harry's angst and sadness. A bit more time is also spent on the relationships between Harry and Sirius, and Harry and Cho, so the viewer is affected more on an emotional level. The climax at the Ministry of Magic is also amazing - roll on Half-Blood Prince!"
1272,9,magical,My favorite movie in my life is 'Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix'. I think I'm going to remember this movie for my entire life.
1273,8,A great film - changing the story slightly to make a much better film - especially compared to Goblet of Fire,Warning Here Be Spoilers
1274,3,OK Movie...,"I cannot but agree to the comments of java5989... This could have been a really great movie if only the actors were much more realistic! For once let Hermoine not act as if every word she says is grave! She can really have a more than a concerned expression on her face! The first two were awesome movies! The second really kept you on the edge! From then on it has become a so-so affair! Even Snape was too unrealistic in this one, he did not bring about the apathy or sympathy one feels for the character in the book, or even in previous films!"
1275,8,About what I expected.,"I walked into the movie expecting there to be quite a few things cut. This was the shortest movie out of the longest book, after all. Many of the cuts were understandable. Some are probably regrettable once they start filming Deathly Hallows. I did enjoy the film, but there were a few things that bothered me."
1276,3,Disgrace to Harry Potter Series,"Before I get eaten alive by fans of this movie, I'd like to stress that my review is based upon having read the books. As I die-hard HP I was sincerely looking forward to this movie until I saw it in theaters. Initially though, when I heard it was only 2hrs & 18 minutes long, I wasn't sure if such a short film (by HP standards) would live up to its predecessors. Unfortunately, my premonitions about the movie were dead on."
1277,10,Harry's growing up!,"I had high hopes for this movie, because I've seen all the others and thought they were great. I've heard a lot of people saying that this movie does not cut when compared to the others. However, I think that this movie tops them all. Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron and all the others are growing up and therefore the stories have to change accordingly. However, I had hoped to see some sort of development between Ron and Hermione :) but I guess it will be there in the next ""story."" ""The tales of Harry Potter and his friends"" have turned into great movies and to my mind they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Have fun watching it."
1278,6,"One of the best Comedies of the Summer, too bad HPOOTP was supposed to be dark and dramatic.(Very minor Deathly Hallows Spoiler, I give warning before it)",Three words: Too Much Comedy.
1279,8,Tonks is wrong!,"Tonks should have been played by Charlotte Coleman! The perfect weird pink haired pixie! Remember Four Weddings and a Funeral? She is totally what I was expecting. Not a long haired, normal looking person. I feel Charlotte could have played the part, making it fun and quirky. Of course it is possible for the next movie, if it's not to late, she is able to change her look at a whim. But, in the next movie she looks a tired, worn, emotional wreck, unable to change from her actual look. To bad, she would have been better for the part. P.S. I have no investment in her at all! Just think she would have been better for the movie. What do you think?"
1280,8,Good but felt rushed and hastily put together,I just came back form viewing this film and i will say that it was definitely worth watching. I read the book a few years ago but i still remembered enough to see that a lot had been left out.
1281,6,"No ""Magic"" to this movie","Coming into the cinemas, I had high expectations for this because I read all the comments and mostly all of the user comments was commendable, so I went to the movie thinking that I'd have the time of my life watching it but boy was I ever disappointed..."
1282,6,what a terrible waste of money,"The longest book is the shortest movie? Are you serious not only did the movie leave out key parts (quidditch and the fight between harry and malfoy, the visit to the hospital amongst others) but they parts they tried to incorporate into the movie were might as wells have been thrown in there with out any concern. Scenes that were too long should have been shorted and key scenes were either too short or left out all together. The acting was acceptable, the girl who played luna lovegood is the only bright spot. Everything else is a trainwreck. Take the money and invest in a good rusty knife, take the knife and proceed to stab yourself in the eye for a good 2 hours or so and you will have an arguably more enjoyable time than watching this poorly put together excuse for an adaption of a novel."
1283,5,Not the best movie I've seen.,(Slight book spoilers)
1284,9,Best movie of them all!,"As a reader of the Harry Potter books and one who has seen all of the movies, I confess I went into the theater expecting something that was barely mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised."
