# Sequels Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we will seek to answer the question of whether sequels are better than the original. We will implement and train a bidirectional LSTM using Keras to perform sentiment analysis on reviews of particular movie series. Although we trained on a kaggle dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, we will also scrape movie reviews from IMDb using Pythonâ€™s selenium library. Check out blog post and thanks for reading!
