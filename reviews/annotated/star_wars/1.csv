0,7.0,"And now, the Darth Vader origin story really begins. In fact, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" sort of renders its predecessor useless. ""Episode I"" feels like a mostly unnecessary part of the story now that ""Episode II"" gives a better glimpse into the troubled young man Anakin Skywalker – the future Darth Vader – has become. ",0
1,9.0,"Much like its predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones has gained a rather sour reputation on the internet. Fortunately, many of the popular complaints about this film are either highly exaggerated or downright wrong. Chapter two of the Star Wars Saga is an energized and highly enjoyable two hours at the movies.",1
2,9.0,"Let me start off by saying that i don't enjoy the love scenes between Anakin and padme, BUT... Anakin is supposed to be awkward socially. So i guess it's realistic?",0
3,8.0,"This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.",1
4,4.0,"It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.",1
5,3.0,"What was it that set Darth Vader off to join the dark side of the force? This film suggests several possibilities: 1) The killing of his mother by Tusken Raiders caused him to channel John Wayne in 'The Searchers.' 2) Getting passed over during the N' Sync tryouts. 3) Discovering the woman of his dreams, upon closer inspection, is a carbonite mannequin. 4) Excess pressure on the back of his head from the so-'90s rattail he wears. 5) The shock of learning his father was evil guy Cole from ""Bachelor Party.""",1
6,8.0,"I'm going back and watching all six Star Wars films so I can go see ""The Force Awakens"", and last night I watched ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"".",1
7,7.0,"First off the movie had some good aspects about it. For one the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was phenomenal. They were emotional and comedic at the same time. The second thing is the action. This movie was very action packed and the choreography in the fights were very good. The conflict was nice as well I just wish they didn't have as many sub-plots. I didn't like how unnecessarily long this movie was, it felt like 3 hours. Some scenes didn't need to be included and I didn't like how they made it seem as if Anakin was obsessed over Padme but other than that their romance was believable and cute. The acting was strong although sometimes it came off as bland. The beginning tried to be serious but ended up looking like a joke. The movie was pretty good overall but could've done better.",1
8,9.0,"So many great moments in this one. Epic battles, strong Jedi, two large armies and even a love story. When I finished watching this one tonight I felt like it was one of my favourite Star Wars, but aren't them all?",1
9,10.0,"I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.",1
10,6.0,"I do agree that this is the weakest of the six Star Wars movies, but it wasn't by all means a terrible movie. I will admit the dialogue is weak and gets nowhere at times, the plot isn't as well thought out and felt convoluted at best, Haydn Christensen does give a truly abysmal performance as Anakin and although the presence of Jar Jar Binks was toned down here his presence anywhere seemed jarring. Still despite the major flaws, it is a marvel to look at with stunning sets and impeccable CGI. The battle sequences are well choreographed, the pace is somewhat brisker than in Phantom Menace and the performances with the exception of Christensen are very good.",0
11,5.0,"I found most of the film to be boring, the interactions between Pádme and Anakin feel very weird and unconfortable, the cgI looks really bad in this one and the mistery that Obi Wan tries to solve is uninteresting. More than half of the movie is boring because of this problems but they are solved in the third act, which happends to be actually interesting and exciting. Also I actually liked the politics in this movie, you can understand them more easily and they actually have really strong consequences. Still, not the worst Star Wars movie.",0
12,9.0,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few who did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive rating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!",1
13,8.0,"Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement and the former queen and now Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) travels to Coruscant to vote on a project to create an army to help the Jedi to protect the Republic. On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Karmino and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other and he has nightmares with his mother. They travel to his planet Tattoine to see his mother and he discovers that she has been abducted by the evil Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying and he kills all the Tusken tribe including the women. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he finds who is behind the Separatist movement. He transmit his discoveries to Anakin since he cannot reach the Jedi Council. Who is the leader of the Separatist movement? Will Anakin receive Obi-Wan's message? And the secret love between Anakin and Amidala will succeed?",1

18,7.0,"The truth is the first time I had watched the movie I wasn't impressed. After rewatches over the years I realised this movie gets so much hate that it didn't deserve. Especially if you compare it to the new movies (episodes 7, 8,9) it is far better in script, character development and battles. Anakin is awesome in this movie and makes you feel totally familiar with yourself the way he acts following your heart instead of cold rules.",1
19,,"Say what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for setting himself a difficult task in `Star Wars: Attack of the Clones' (and I do mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly high expectations of his millions of fanatical followers).   By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do  which is to risk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central `hero.'  After all, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy, we all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the irredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the requirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo, though he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous side to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his internal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side (certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is privy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind of poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a better job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more than a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time  hardly either the `greatest Jedi knight' we keep being told he has the potential to become nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.   His romantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala are embarrassing at best.  We have indeed come a long way from the fun love triangle involving Luke, Han and the feisty Princess Leia.",1
20,7.0,"Episode II of the Star Wars saga, ""Attack of the Clones"" had the misfortune of following the poorly received first instalment.

22,8.0,"This might be the most intricately detailed and plotted of all the Star Wars films, but judging from all the negative reviewers on this board, I have to wonder if they paid attention long enough to understand what was going on. Conspiracy and double crosses abound, with the introduction of Christopher Lee's character Count Dooku leading the separatist movement against the Republic. Then there's Chancellor Palpatine pulling strings that will eventually give rise to the supremacy of the Sith and the Dark Side of the Force. His flattery of young Anakin Skywalker is recognition of the Jedi's powerful potential, and is intended to hasten his corruption.",0
23,6.0,"The story is very interesting and well paced. Most of the characters are really well written. The score is beautiful with very good fight scenes. The dialogue isn't the best. The romance was very weird to watch and didn't really work for me. Also, in the middle of the movie its gets a bit boring.",1
24,1.0,"Although I'm not a Star Wars fanatic (I certainly don't read the books or anything), I love the old Star Wars movies.  In fact, when I was littler, The Empire Strikes Back was my favorite film.  Now that I'm older, I respect them for what they are: incredibly creative, exciting and touching films. I have yet to see Episode 1. My friend recommended Episode 2 to me, telling me that it was better than its predecessor, but warning me ""don't see it if you expect anything more than a Star Wars movie."" Maybe I just have a nostalgic love for the first trilogy, but I would never think that they were anywhere near as poor, in any way, as this new garbage. I can't think of a high budget movie that I've seen that has such bad directing, bad acting, bad casting, bad special effects (or lack thereof), bad music, bad dialogue and bad plot, as ATTACK OF THE CLONES (bad title too).  The reviewers on this site giving this movie positive reviews must all be brainwashed. Maybe they're all just excited that it's better than Episode One, which I can only assume must be the worst movie ever made, considering this one definitely belongs in the bottom 100.",0
25,6.0,"Attach of the clones is a very underrated Star Wars movie yes it's not perfect but is it as bad as lots of people say it is no its not. There is a lot of problems with this movie but there is some good things to. There is some great performances in this movie by most of the cast like Ewan mcgregor who gives the best performance in this movie. The villain count doku is great but there is also problems with him. The lightsaber fights are well shot and well made. The music is also great once again by John Williams. But theIr is a lot problems with attack of the clones. The story is all over the place and there is not really a set story with this movie. The villain count doku is a very great villain but the problem with him is he's barley in the movie he doesn't show up until an hour into the film and when he does show up there really isn't no threat of danger or anything by him until he captures Obi wan. The dialog in this movie is very sloppy and just bad from the infamous lines about sand and how anakin hates sand. Let's talk about Handen Christensen as Anakin he's awful as Anakin and he gives terrible performance. The love relationship between Anakin and Padme is also terrible you don't by into these 2 being in love at all because they are not supposed to be together and Padme is so on and off about her feelings for Anakin it's just bad. Overall, attack of the clones is not amazing Star Wars it's mediocre but it's not as bad as everyone says it is. Yes the pros are there but they can't save this movie.",0

31,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was one of the most colossally disappointing films I've ever seen in my life. Now comes the second installment in George Lucas's prequel trilogy to the epic narrative that broke box office records and set standards for generations to come. The second movie detailing the past of Darth Vader, ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is a little bit better, but that's not quite enough to make it a recommendable movie. It's close, but not quite. If it only they had thrown out Jar-Jar Binks (yes, I still cringe every time I think of that bumbling, frog-like freak), patched up some mediocre dialogue, reworked this sappy love story, and captured a better sense of the magic that we require for a Star Wars movie, it would have worked.",0
32,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is the fifth of so far seven Star Wars films and the second film from the second trilogy, which makes it film number 2 as well in terms of chronology.

The cast includes a handful names that defined the second era of Star Wars films, such as Portman, Christensen and McGregor. And of course all the known characters that I won't have to mention here by name.",0
33,10.0,"As a Star Wars fan, I've often wondered why the latest two Star Wars films have taken quite a beating, and I think part of the reason is this: thanks to the fact that we saw Episodes IV thru VI first, we already know how the story ends, and so much of the suspense is lost, leaving fans with much more energy to expend on their complaints. I mean, let's be honest, the acting and dialog in the Star Wars series has always been more a matter of competence than brilliance, it was the wonderful imagination and groundbreaking visual effects that made them great.",1
34,7.0,"I really want to know way some think we have to ""face facts"" that is is a horrid movie. In the cinema world there is NO SUCH THING as ""FACT"", either on the screen or on a critic's page. It's OPINION, no matter who's giving it. I knew what to expect, mediocre dialogue, whacky characters, ""bad feelings"", but also GREAT visuals, great mythology, and SUPERB action, so I just accept that this is to serve the purpose of ""escapism"". In the drama department, I felt it was the best of the series. The romance was forced, but that's minor enough for me that I can accept it as not being entertained, but rather being informed. Don't like it? Go ahead, but I'm sick and tired of others who push to dictate others to have to agree with them about a movie's quality.",0
35,7.0,"This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. This film has a feel; you can sense it and I was getting a little shaky halfway through. It's fun watching it. In its category it is amongst the best. I was impressed. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them. Some great costumes and dialog move it all along. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting. It reminds me of French movies where it's more about the characters and their environment.",1
36,,"I just watched this on DVD last night, having seen it in the theatre. I was very disappointed when I watched the scenes that had been cut, as they fleshed out the story a lot more than the final cut. You learned more about the wasp creatures near the end of the film and why Dooku enlisted their help. Padme's character was a lot more established as well in visits to her parents house and in a confrontation with Dooku.",0
37,1.0,"That's pretty much the general sentiment about the Episode II, but I would have to disagree because that would imply that The Phantom Menace was any good.  A better assessment might be that Attack of the Clone was no worse. It's basically a bunch of long drawn out sequences involving indiscernible politics (except, perhaps, to the fanatics)  and a painfully forced romance, plus another annoying scene involving a fat, four-armed alien in a diner, punctuated by a string of action sequences that just barely save this film from being a total waste of $9.25.",0

And during this entire scene, the piece of fruit is completely computer generated, and it shows.

The film picks up 10 years later with now Anakin Skywalker growing up and more yet he's still being trained by Obi-Wan you can see that young Skywalker is stubborn and soon may slip to the evil side of the dark empire as the top Jedi masters can even feel it. However in the current time Anakin has started a romance with Padme who use to be a former senator and things are more complex when the empire puts out an assassination attempt out on her life. The Jedi army then has to take her back to Naboo for her protection.

52,7.0,"While I didn't think it was possible for a Star Wars film to be more hated than Episode 1, Episode 2 fits that description according to many fans. Just like The Phantom Menace, this won't be an easy one to talk about because it's often considered the weakest movie in a trilogy that's already been criticized for years. To be fair for just a moment, I didn't think this movie was that unimpressive, but it's still not on par with the original three films. The movie does have more of an emphasis on action this time around, so overall, I feel it's an improvement. Not to mention, it furthers Anakin's story a bit more and we get to see him fight with his inner evil more vigorously. Attack of the Clones takes place about a decade after the events of episode 1. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is now a Jedi Padawan to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and they have been assigned to protect Padme on the city planet of Coruscant. She's there in order to get the Galactic Senate to authorize creation of a military in order to fight against a separatist movement. This movement is led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), who was the mentor to Qui-Gon Jinn from the Phantom Menace. Dooku has turned to the Dark Side and created his own Separatist faction. Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan meet up again and Anakin is disappointed to find out the girl he's thought about every day for a decade seems to be indifferent towards him. Little do they all realize that she is being tracked by an assassin named Zam Wessell, who is part of an alien race that can change their physical appearance. Zam tries to kill Padme while she sleeps with two poisonous creatures resembling centipedes, but Anakin and Obi-Wan disrupt her attempt and pursue her in a flying speeder car. After latching onto her speeder and making her crash, Anakin tries to interrogate Zam and find out who she's working for, but someone shoots a toxic dart into her neck to prevent her from talking. Obi-Wan meets with his friend Dexter at a diner to discuss the origin of the strange projectile, and Dex tells him it could have only come from a planet called Kamino which is inhabited by a race of aliens who clone people for use in warfare. Obi-Wan searches some archives and finds out that the planet apparently doesn't exist, and then deduces it was intentionally removed to keep its existence a secret. The Jedi Council tells Obi-Wan to head toward the center of a gravity field where the planet is supposed to be, and he'll find it. After travelling to Kamino, he discovers that they have vast cloning facilities located there and a huge order has been placed by someone named Sifo Dyas in order to build up an army. Obi-Wan talks with a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, who has one of the clones as his son, Boba. All the thousands of clones on Kamino are based on Jango's DNA, and he's also the person who killed Zam to shut her up. Obi-Wan finds out that Dyas has actually been dead for years, and whoever placed the order did so without permission from the Jedi Council. Knowing his ruse has been discovered, Jango and his son try to leave the planet, and Obi-Wan fights Jango in an attempt to stop his starfighter (the Slave 1) from taking off. He's unable to do so, but manages to throw a beacon onto the ship's hull so he knows where they're going. Concurrently, Anakin and Padme get more involved with each other romantically, even though Jedi are supposed to be aloof to this kind of thing. Anakin senses through the Force that his mother is in great pain and decides to go to Tatooine to look for her, disobeying his mandate to protect Padme in the process. Anakin meets up with Watto again who confesses he sold Shmi years ago to someone named Cliegg Lars. After seeking him out and talking with him, Anakin finds that his mother was abducted by tusken raiders and is presumed dead. He makes his way to a distant tusken raider settlement and tries to rescue Shmi, but she dies in his arms. For the first time, Anakin completely loses control of himself and kills absolutely everybody in the camp. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan follows Jango to the planet of Geonosis, where Viceroy Nute Gunray has been trying to assemble a huge droid army. He's also the one responsible for trying to kill Padme. Dooku is here as well, and Obi-Wan is eventually captured. Padme and Anakin fly to Geonosis to help him, but are also captured by overwhelming enemy forces. Padme, Obi-Wan and Anakin are sent to be killed in a gladiatorial style arena featuring large alien animals, but large amounts of Jedi and clone gunships ambush the event. Jango is killed, and Dooku manages to escape on a speeder bike. Anakin and Obi-Wan fly over huge battlefields and come face to face with Dooku in his hideout. Dooku subdues both of them pretty effortlessly, and even though Master Yoda shows up to assist, he still manages to escape to Coruscant. Dooku has with him the plans for an extremely powerful weapon (The Death Star) which will be used as a trump card against the Republic's foes. Finally, Anakin and Padme are married on the planet Naboo. This movie is often considered to be either the worst or second worst Star Wars film, but I didn't think it was that terrible. It does have a lot of boring scenes (mostly the love scenes between Anakin and Padme), but the action scenes are good as ever. A lot of people criticize Hayden's ability to act, which I kind of agree with. Many of the scenes between him and Natalie Portman still make me cringe, and even the latter's character in the movie is put off by him. I did at least appreciate how they show him slowly transitioning to being evil. Once Anakin takes revenge for the death of his mom and starts ranting to Padme about how he should be all powerful, his path to becoming Darth Vader is assured. Christopher Lee in all his glory is also in this, and for me, that alone makes it worth it. Jango Fett was also one of the best things about this movie, since he's one of the most proficient fighters in Star Wars but doesn't have use of the Force. I shouldn't need to clarify, but the soundtrack is once again absolutely great (John Williams always is). Overall, it might be true that Attack of the Clones is one of the weaker Star Wars movies, but it still manages to be better that Episode 1 (even if that's not saying much). It does at least move the story forward in a believable way.",1

And, given it's budget, some of the actors in it, and just the fact that it is part of the saga itself, perhaps a contender for one of the worst films of all time, at least worst big-budget films. And I remember when this first came out that a significant number of fans thought THIS was better than Phantom Menace...Nope! Not even close, actually.",0

Simply because of the clone army, I grew up on the clone troopers since ever and I did wish they had more screen time in the film, to see them more often. The writing was a little off, more scenes were really stupid and became a joke/memes. The acting was exaggerated for example Hayden christensen and others. All in all it was fine, good enough.",0
57,3.0,"Rather than listen to the desperate pleas of millions of Star Wars fans worldwide, George Lucas ploughs ahead with Attack of the Clones in precisely the same manner that made The Phantom Menace a disappointment of star destroyer proportions: there's even more boring political subterfuge, even more dreadful CGI, even more ridiculous OTT action sequences (worst bits being Obi Wan and Anakin in pursuit of an assassin and the very silly droid factory sequence), and even more bloody Jar Jar Binks!!",0

A very eree parallel to the same series of events and similar circumstances Luke went through however Anakin is having it a lot worse than Luke did in my opinion. This new kid Hayden Christensen was perfect for Anakin. He played a very convincing person I could forsee becoming Darth Vader. He better be in Episode 3. And Natalie Portman, she gets more and more beautiful in every movie. Ewan McGregor is the best Obi Wan Kenobi. I hope that the actor playing Jango returns as Boba Fett (with some growth acceleration) for Episode 3. This movie was such an excellent parallel to Empire Strikes Back. Episode 1 paralleled A New Hope, kind of their own establishing movies that weren't that in depth. You know they are going to parallel Episode 3 with Return of the Jedi, I forsee Anakin fighting and slaying Dooku taking his place at Palpatine's side.",1

Whenever someone knocks a bad movie, which Episode II qualifies as, they immediately raise the pitchforks towards the actors. If your going to lay some blame, lay it at the feet of George Lucas. It was his puerile script that brought the actors to their knees, and his lack of direction that made them stay there. It was George's unholy fascination with all things digital that massacred the screen with billions of wasted pixilated images, making the flesh and blood actors seem like they stepped into the Twilight Zone.",0

It does everything a sequel should do, building on returning characters while delighting in walk-on one shotters and bold new additions to the already impressive collection of players in the story; and while some of the romance can fall flat, the raw passion as Christensen captures Anakin's frustration and rage gives Clones some of the more dramatic moments in the saga.",1

74,10.0,The great thing with Lucas going back to his baby is that he can change the landscape of what it means to be Star Wars. And Attack of the Clones is the least Star Wars of all 6 episodes in the best way possible. It's the only one where nothing big is really at stake. There's no race against the clock and it's the lightest of all the movies. Which I enjoy greatly. This is the final outing before everything goes to hell in the galaxy.,0

I love the feel yet again. I always liked how this movie has two stories. We have the detective obi wan story ald the Anakin and Padme love story. I love that. I love that Obi Wan needs to investigate a bounty hunter and how we get to see Kamino. I'll always love that detective Obi Wan side. And yes, the love story is a bit cringe, but that's the way dialogue always work in Star Wars. Don't you dare tell me that the OG star wars have the most deep love stories going on. Luke just sees Leia as a beautiful woman and it doesn't go deeper than that. George INTENDED this kind of wooden dialogue. And I love it. Both these stories come together in Geonosis where we see an epic battle that begins the Clone wars. Perfect. Yeah go on, hate me.",1

78,10.0,"Whatever you thought about Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace, whatever you disliked about Jar Jar Binks or the little child Anakin had been in the first part of this spectacular space saga, forget you must about all your concerns! I had the possibility to watch Episode II this night at about 1:00 o'clock in the city of Munich/Germany at a charity preview screening! What I saw some 13 hours ago is the movie of the movies, the movie every true fan and every moviegoer has waited for! This time director George Lucas managed to deliver a fine performance in directing, storytelling and visualization of the great events that take place in this 2 hours 22 minutes thrill-ride I'd like to call the second best Star Wars movie of all time which means that this is the second best movie of all time (after the original Episode IV - but, hey, I've only seen it one time until now so things could hint at a No. 1 spot in my personal list!). The movie's atmosphere is far more darker than that of Episode I and I think that Episode II is even darker than Episode V. The galaxy's in a real turmoil, because of the separatists that want to leave the Republic. The story has a wonderful pace I'd like to compare with Episode IV. There's not a single second one feels bored or one feels strange about anything. All the different subplots are developed perfectly and find their climax in a gigantic battle in the end of the movie. The actors all deliver excellent performances. Especially Hayden Christensen's performance marks the perfect portrayal of the later Darth Vader. You can really feel his inner battle with the dark side. He is a good person with a good heart, but certain things make him turn. In Episode II, during one of the highlights of the movie, Anakin is confronted with his first dark actions. It will take your breath away, I promise you! Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor do a great job and keep up the fine pace of the movie. McGregor gets to do a lot this time and some of his quotations will be remembered! The hidden star of the movie, now one can deny that, is Yoda. Yes, you heard it right, Yoda. The Jedi-Master shows the audience why he is the greatest Jedi of all time and also proves that the advance of digital animation can't be stopped...... The Special Effects are totally exciting, excellent and brilliant, but they never stand above the story, no, they drive the story forward and underline all the aspects of the movie. The CG-characters in this movie look so realistic (especially Yoda) that you just won't believe it. Compared with Spider-Man (a very good movie, too!) where the animated Spider-Man can be recognized during a lot of scenes as an animation Episode II's CG-characters interact perfectly with the real actors. And talking about technical aspects...... I didn't see any hint that the pictures were entirely shot digitally! The picture looks brilliant, colourful and very rich! The sound effects are superb and John Williams' score perfectly underlines this motion picture experience! What else to say than well, I already have my tickets for the midnight premiere on Wednesday/Thursday and I'll again enjoy a hell of thrill-ride watching this movie that tells us a story of good versus evil from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... May the force be with you! Always!",1
79,5.0,"The movie is very boring in the first half of the events. The last fight between the Jedi against the Alin was good, your character Count Dokku did not like me, the average movie of Anakin's relationship with Padmé was not influential to me, the scene of Anakin's anger and the killing of all those who killed his mother was a great scene",0

81,7.0,"This is by far the ""worst"" of all of the Star Wars films (including the Animated Clone Wars Movie). I use the term worst lightly as it is an overall good film, it just doesn't hold up to the dramatic standards of the original trilogy or Phantom Menace.",0
82,,Star Wars Ep. 2: Attack of the Clones (2002) ,0
83,,"After what many perceived to be a weak entry in the prequel trilogy of the star wars movies with regards to TPM. Lucas still 'did his own thing' and produced one of the most breathtaking, exhilarating and fantastic star wars films to date. In this film we have already established characters thrust upon the cinema screen once again. The opening scroll is simpler than in TPM, it doesn't require us to think, it just puts us into the right frame of mind to pick up the story. As soon as we see a ship gliding through the foggy clouds we see straight away that something is amiss in the republic. The bright and breezy republic in the previous film seems to be bathed in fog. Difficult to see the dark side is. Lucas said these are silent movies and the visuals tell their own story and it happens a lot in this film, like the Darth Vader silhouette that had no digital tinkering whatsoever . The footage of Anakin with his robes on was basically a mirror image of darth vader but without the helmet. The footage of Padme next to him was strikingly reminiscent of Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Absolutely everything in this movie is intriguing, Obi-Wan Kenobi investigates a clone facility on the planet of Kamino. A mysterious Sifo Dyas placed an order for the Clone army based on a template of a Bounty Hunter called Jango Fett. Jango Fett states he was employed by a man called Darth Tryannus. We find a former Jedi, Count Dooku knows all about the corruption in the senate, even if the Jedi arnt yet aware and plans to do something about it. Secretly creating a new order with the goal to build an army powerful enough to fight the Republics army. A republic army which was mysteriously started at the Clone facility even though the Jedi Council were not aware! Confused? Nointrigued? Most definitely. Anakin Skywalker also gets given a sole mission on his own. Its here that the much vaunted love story begins. To be honest, it's a bit choppy and seems rushed. Its not a smooth romance like in The Empire Strikes Back, instead it's a romance which reeks of desperation, as if the characters themselves know about their impending doom and they just want to be as one before the inevitable happens. The deleted scenes on the DVD really should have been implemented within the film. They are gold, with regards to character motivations and shows little glimpses of their affection to each other. Would have made the final, declaration of love scene less jarring. In fact, would have been completely smooth and believable. The final showpiece in this film is the Clone Wars, they begin on a planet called Geonosis and this is where the film gives us a scene so wonderful it just keeps on piling the cherry's on top of the cake. A superb full scale war better than anything in any star wars movie happens, its absolute mayhem and its absolutely brilliant. But it doesent end there, we have not one lightsaber fight, not two, but three. With the third being one of the most memorable of all time. Also, a plot point that culminated in A New Hope makes its entrance here and it left me absolutely gob smacked Basically, this film is everything you would want in a star wars movie. Is it the best star wars film out there? Quite possible, difficult to call. Had George Lucas just gone with the flow and put in the Padme/Anakin deleted scenes plus toned down the over bearing nature of Anakin in the fireplace scene (after reading an earlier draft there's some vocal foreplay at the beginning that would have been great to have in the final movie) then this would have been the best Star Wars film without a doubt. We see intrigue, we see action and we see the galaxy begin to rot away in a very obvious way. The beginning of the end.",1

Of course I was about 7 then but nonetheless it was the ultimate for many people of my generation, and then we grew up but perhaps it is that I have grown up that I didn't enjoy this one wanting a film for adults.

In the first episode, you could tell that he was more than just self-confident, but his childlike manner covered that up and you didn't know what direction the whole thing was going to take.

Obi Wan's becoming increasingly concerned over his Padawans behaviour, while the Jedi Council struggle to keep the peace as the galaxy appears to be on the brink of war.

For example, a lot of people complain about Anakin being whiney at times, but, strangely, I don't remember them complaining about how whiney Luke was throughout A New Hope and Empire.

Moving on as to why I think Attack of the Clones is such a great film, well the obvious really is the CGI, I love the CGI in this movie. The CGI in this film is commonly criticised by I think the worlds in this film such as Coruscant and Naboo were so beautiful to look at. To see those futuristic flying ships flying about on Coruscant makes it look so futuristic. Naboo looks so beautiful, I love the look of the rooms and buildings in the entire Prequel trilogy, many of those rooms and buildings wouldn't of looked so great without the CGI.",1

Dooko and who ever....Action packed scenes with obi wan and anakin in the flying car chase solving mysteries like....whos hiding in the dark behind the counter trying to not do anything, at all, but they'll end up evil.. and the light saber battle with Yoda was rise up out of a coffin and clap good.

91,1.0,"Easily the most tedious film of the year and of the series and of the genre. You'd find better action sequences on a cheap games console and better acting in a primary school production of the wizard of oz. And the blame lies squarely on Lucas' shoulders. This kind of dialogue would get you kicked out of film school. Dribbled with strained references to the original series and delivered with the verve of a George W. Bush speech on international trade agreements. The only people who come out relatively unscathed are the traditionally camped-up hammer-horror-style bad guys and Ewan McGregor's continuing pastiche of Alec Guinness. The ""romantic"" leads are like being forced to watch the world's least interesting high-school sweethearts pretending to have a squabble. Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.",0

He really puts a lot of effort to win her over as she plays hard to get. We see the first signs of darkness in Anakin Skywalker. The settings are gorgeous such as the home near the lake. Jedi Masters struggle to find the villain who has clouded their minds. And finally, we learn that R2-D2 can fly.",1

As a child, the more complicated storyline was difficult to follow but now I think it is fantastic. Disney taking over Star Wars is like the Republic being destroyed and becoming the Empire; Kathleen Kennedy is the perfect characterization for Darth Sidious. Slowly biding her time and then being given ultimate control because of her earned trust. Once the trust was given by Lucas however, she revealed herself for what she truly is. It's quite perfect....serendipitous really. Whatever the case, Kathleen Kennedy and Disney Lucasfilm can't hold a candle to what George and his colleagues did in the past. Try as she might. The OT and PT stand the test of time and the ST ages like milk. I give it a 10/10 to offset the fact that it has a lower score than many Disney shows (bought reviews IMO).

This movie, and it's most recent predecessor, left you begging for the end of the movie and of Lucas' career as a writer.

This has been criticized as poor dialog and poor acting but it is actually ingenious on Lucas' part and will stand the test of time.

Still, it was clear that fans were shocked by EPISODE I's uneven mix of childish goofiness and stoic sluggishness, and many hoped Lucas would make amends with the subsequent entries. Unfortunately, the second prequel, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, is no improvement; in fact it comes across as the nadir of both the prequel trilogy and the whole STAR WARS franchise. While some might argue that THE PHANTOM MENACE is more deserving of that title, in reality, it was EPISODE II that truly brought a once respected series to a new low. Carrying over many of the same faults as its predecessor (stale acting and dialogue, overuse of CGI), and introducing two major new ones, it was almost enough to make many wonder what had become of Lucas' talents in the years since the original trilogy. Even with the argument that its primary purpose is to function as a transition between Episodes I and the far superior III, it still comes up short, the occasional decent moment notwithstanding.",0

129,5.0,"Yes, of all six. At this point, nothing(or infinitely, insignificantly little) remains ""real"" in these movies. That, in itself, doesn't have to be a problem. But we can tell. It doesn't feel right. Sin City doesn't have this problem, nor does 300. The effects are, technically speaking, amazing, but nothing else in this really goes beyond being ""decent"". The romance lacks credibility(and yes, I am aware that some of it was left on the cutting room floor, but we're going by the finished product, not the intent). The overall story... well, Lucas gives many fans something they may have wanted in spite of there being absolutely no basis for it, and sacrifices it making sense in doing so. This tries too hard to tie in with the OT(which, I should point out so that no one mistakes me for someone who grew up with it, I didn't attentively view until Episode I was out). The dialog gets to be downright painful, with one even contradicting something in the first(written by the same guy, a few years earlier...!). The plot isn't that engaging, and things that ought to be in the next are here(and vice versa). The pacing is reasonable. The light-saber bits could be considerably better(they are particularly unimpressive compared to Phantom Menace), and at times, it's the tamest it's been since Return, although it isn't all bad. The action in general, mostly, it's just overdone, and goes on for too long. There are cool ideas and concepts, but their lackluster execution results in them merely being unable to be used soon by more talented film-makers. The title could be that of a 50's schlocky sci-fi flick. The battles do have notable, interesting aspects... in the editing and cinematography, mainly. The actors have put in solid performances elsewhere, or, at least, less embarrassing ones. Characters could stand improvement, and, you know, consistency. The score is still good. The DVD holds over a dozen(not all more than minutes long) featurettes, deleted scenes, trailers, TV-spots and a commentary. I recommend this exclusively to those who must watch all of Star Wars. 5/10",0

131,8.0,"Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a mostly terrific cast. Most Star Wars fans won't consider it a work of art, but it is a huge improvement from the Phantom Menace no doubt, the story is well executed, the character development is much better and the comic relief is great, it was unbearable in Phantom Menace, with new character Jar Jar Binks being the main source of laughs, this time around it is back to C3P0, which made me very happy, his lines were genuinely funny and not just cringe to listen to. There are some poor moments in this film, while I do think Hayden Christensen shines in some scenes, particularly the one with his mother, he is very weak many times, particularly his parts with Natalie Portman, there is no chemistry between either of them, no indication of passion and all of their dialogue is very cliché, I think they wanted Anakin and Padmé's relationship to be the Han and Leia of the prequels, but they didn't succeed. The performances are much better this time around, Ewan McGregor steals the show as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he wasn't worth much praise in the first one, but this time he is playing a much older and wiser version of the character, which he delivered very well and is one of the highlights of the prequel trilogy, Christopher Lee is outstanding as the villain, though this film once again suffers from taking a ridiculously long time before introducing us to its main villain, there are also great performances from Samuel L. Jackson and, of course, voice actors Anthony Daniels and Frank Oz, who is given a bigger and better role as Yoda this time around that is sure to please fans. Though it may still be missing that sci-fi magic that is very evident in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones is still a very enjoyable movie that should impress fans, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure or sci-fi film.

Also the whole politics plot everyone was hating is amazing after all to see how genius were Palpatine's actions.

Maybe it's because of how bad the ""The Phantom Menace"" is. But I thought the story was passable and moved along in a mediocre manner. Sure the romantic parts seemed so forced and corny. But it has enough lightsaber action and battle sequences to make it worth the watch. The acting isn't really good but Hayden Christensen put on the most wooden performance out of the bunch. And he is suppose to be a very emotionally driven character, but he failed because of the wooden performance. Despite Anakin being a incompetent apprentice because of him being very driven by his emotions, it was understandable to a degree. So I can't take that away from the character. But I do think the future Darth Vader could have been written better and more badass. I think George Lucas picked the wrong actor to portray one of the greatest villain in movie history. Overall, this is a okay installment, sure there is plenty of ways it could have been better. But it is a passable installment.",0

145,7.0,"Attack of the Clones is probably my less favorite Star Wars movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the originals movies more, but I don't hate the prequels like some fans do. Director George Lucas didn't rape my childhood. The prequels were pretty interesting for me. A story about Anakin Skywalker's rise and fall, how the empire got started, details about the Clone Wars, all of these ideas sound good. But it was executed in a way that wasn't that well done. It didn't felt like Star Wars, we came to love as children. The film is set 10 years after the events in 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a rebel Jedi named Count Dooku AKA General Robert E. Lee rip off (Christopher Lee), thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo, Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars. The first thing, I would notice about Attack of the Clones is how boring it is. There is barely any action in a film titled 'Star Wars' in this film. Even with the limited action scenes, with all the visual effects, it doesn't look real enough to care. No sense of danger in a world full of CGI. We know its CGI characters fighting other CGI characters. Why do we care about the clones? We have no feelings for them if they get killed nor do we care about the robots. The rest of the film is replace with talking scenes about politics, non-realistic love, and unrelated issues we can't even put our hands around. The audience is expected to accept too many things that we are told and not told about. Too much talk, and not enough show. Honestly, we not shown how the character feel about each other, but told how they are. How on Earth, is Anakin and Obi-Wan even good friends, they sound like they can't stand each other, most of the film? They complain about each other way too much. Plus, their action doesn't match their words. Obi Wan is supposed to be the mentor and Anakin is the loose-cannon, but in some scene, the roles are reverse. Obi Wan does stupid stuff like jumping out of a building onto a probe droid. Then Anakin jump into another speeder. Man, these scenes are way unrealistic and cartoony. Plus, the whole assassin plot really doesn't go anywhere, anyways as it tossed out halfway through the film. It was as useless as the shift shifter assassin who doesn't use his/her shift shifter powers. The whole relationship with Anakin with Padme is awkward and flat, too. It seem forced as hell as both have no reason why to love with each other. Both character are total different from each other and share little in common. Anakin is clearly violent, arrogant, and Padme still take the guy. It seem like one-dimension romance like Romeo and Juliet where they just madly fall for each other for no reason. Why couldn't they just make Padme tempt Anakin to sin by loving, similar to Eve tempting Adam with the apple? It would have made more sense. I don't understand why Senator Amidala isn't allow to love. Politicians have sex all the time, everybody knows that. Plus, I don't understand why love is banned in the Jedi Order. Its OK, to get angry as a Jedi, but to love is bad. The Jedi Order seems some of the dumbest people on Earth. First off, nobody check up on the missing Sith Lord from the last movie; second off, none of the Jedi had a clue that an army is being build and the guy that probably build it is probably the Sith Lord, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). It makes no sense. This movie makes Yoda (Frank Oz) look so dumb. I was deeply angry to see Yoda is force to fight with a Lightsaber. I thought of him like peaceful loving figure like Gandhi who didn't need a lightsaber because of his wisdom and knowledge. He was great Jedi master, because he master the force, not the lightsaber. I hate the fact, that George Lucas even have a scene where Yoda train children with lightsabers. Isn't that a bit dangerous for children? Why is Yoda doing this, anyways? Yoda never train Luke with a lightsaber in 1980's Empire Strike Back. He use the force, not weapons. In the end, the massive story and the virtual filmmaking kinda ruin of the film for some. I did like the movie. I don't want to leave this review with a sour note with only negative notes. There are good things about the film. Epic battle scenes. Another great score from John Williams. Alright acting from all the main actors. Great themes like warnings signs of fascism and how democracy can quickly fall. I didn't mind the poetic similarities in the prequels that remind us of the original source. I was pretty pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks has only a minor role. Last, I did like great world building of the film. The movie is watchable and still need to be check out if a big Star Wars fan. If you happen to be one of the very few movie audiences never to see a Star Wars film. Watch the Originals first, not this lousy movie. They are making sequels to the originals, so maybe there is a new hope coming soon. Let's hope so.",0

147,7.0,"Perhaps even now, nearly 3 years since this movie first appeared on screens, it may be too early to fairly judge the second chapter of the Star Wars saga, The Attack of the Clones. As the pieces of this awkward jig-saw puzzle that is the Star Wars saga come together, it has become more and more difficult to judge the stories of each chapter. How will it set up the next movie? How much of the first and second movies relate to the last 3 movies? Do we need to care about these characters? After the final movie of the the 6 movie series by George Lucas hits the screens in May 2005, the successes and failures of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones will finally be clear. I say all of this because I have always been a fan of the Star Wars movies, and as excited as I was to see new movies about the time long ago in the galaxy far, far away, it has been hard to say that these first two movies have been what was expected. The original Star Wars movies were full of joy and whimsy, going places we have never been before, battling an enemy we have never seen before, but can identify with. Good vs. Evil is easy to see, and perhaps it's that the early episodes in the saga are murky in who's good and who isn't hinders the films. The Attack of the Clones looks great; we know everything is generated by a computer, but still looks right and good enough that we accept it as real. My favorite scene is how the special effects artists zooms from one passing ship to another, making it look like it was shot with a real camera. The acting is wooden, perhaps encouraged by the dry script. The love story we are subjected to is pretty lame, which for ""forbidden"" love, that's hard to do. Where is Han Solo and Princess Leia's sassy triste when you really need it? Ewan McGregor is good enough as Obi-Won Kenobi, but the other characters are unmemorable and uninteresting. The story itself, I will say this, it does leave a lot of interesting places for the 3rd film to go, assuming of course Lucas does that. I said the same thing after Phantom Menace but Attack of the Clones didn't really capitalize on the openings that were there. Again, the ultimate judge on this film is how it fits in with the other segments of the Star Wars saga. If this was the build-up to a climatic Revenge of the Sith, then it will be worth your time to check out Episode 2. If the third movie veers off into other plot points, then don't waste your time with Attack of the Clones. Just go out and rent The Empire Strikes Back for a well done middle cog to a 3 movie trilogy.",1

You know that Anakin soon or later will get it on with Padme, and the actors know that and we know that, but most of their scenes feel so forced that i find myself laughing at one of the most corning love dialogs in movie history.",1
150,8.0,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is the eagerly anticipated sequel to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. After three years since the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include Jar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten year old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what could be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure ourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that classic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom Menace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons we'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom Menace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom Menace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice little bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures together and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know what they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures. George Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute scene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie, like they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs reminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb went off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and we as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the script takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are friends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi Wan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they do there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area. Obi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's on Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize the film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the film, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right script is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by George Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the way Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this movie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down upon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound much better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another reason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story, they say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very clichéd. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's clichéd as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help either! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares, we think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also uses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this movie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got the Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the Jedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's epic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally clashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty cool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber. Then Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the Star Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome battle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see Chancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in one of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great thing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic self again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between Anakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the child of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi Wan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a thrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love like Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is our personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for some reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not much like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy in this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly slaughters countless Tusken Raiders. And when he attempts to run at the movies' villain with a light saber with hate and anger! Though there are some scenes where he's kind-hearted, most of it is just him being arrogant, but this doesn't really bother us. Another great thing about the film is Count Dooku, he makes the film very enjoyable but the slightly UN-EVEN pacing of the film makes him enter a full hour in! Episode II is an epic story that goes in depth at the look of how the death of Anakin's mother will influence his fall to the dark side and how his love for Padme will cross a forbidden Jedi rule. The only thing wrong with this film, that bugs us enough to point out is the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin, which should have been expanded. Nonetheless Episode II is the strongest of the saga but suffers from an onslaught of under-ration by fans just because of a few reasons they that can't even explain...",0

I saw one of the producers saying that one of the things they use to choose the actors who would play Anakin and Padme, was their looks: they needed to look similar to their kids, Luke and Leia. Natalie Portman is okay, but Hayden Cristensen doesn't have ANYTHING similar in his looks to Luke Skywalker. So, this was not good at all to me.In the second Episode of Star Wars ''Attack of the Clones '', 10 years have passed since the first Episode, and now we have Obi Wan Kenobi as a master and Anakin as his young adult padawan.Padme, ex Queen, is now a Senator representing her world. Anakin behaves like a rebel, and he is very arrogant because he knows about his own abilities;Sometimes he has lapses and thoughts that will lead him to be the famous Darth Vader in the future.(One thing is true: it's funny to see Anakin saying that he considers Obi Wan as his father..sounds very ironical when you know how Star Wars is going to end).",0

154,10.0,I unlie 99.9999% of the planet have not gotten around to seeing the original series. It was something that just never caught my interest until the first Prequel came out. So I figured I might as well watch the films in chronological order.,0

156,7.0,"Let me tell you I am not a fan of this movie. The pacing is extremely slow and I have seen better love stories in a minute from the movie Up then what they attempted with Anakin in this. I am extremely dis-tasted at the romantic scenes along with the acting throughout the whole movie. Just disappointing that this is branded with the Star Wars name. But I know what you must be thinking, this movie must really be bad and I must be incredibly cynical. But let me just say this piece isn't all bad. Throughout there are many wonders you can cherish and take with you long after the movie is done. Such as the incredible ending scene on Geonosis, along with the final lightsaber fight at the end with the oh so loved Yoda shining through. Including Jango Fett, which is another treat by himself to come from this movie. From the fights on Kamino to the incredible air scrimmage above Geonosis I am just speechless. The fights in this movie are amazing; the only thing bringing this movie down honestly is what they attempted with Anakin. I give it a 7 out of ten for the most everything but the attempted love story. ""Mmm. Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing."" - Yoda",0

Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography is by David Tattersall.

162,1.0,"This is a film that took three of the most beloved films of all time and sold their souls to CGI. The original Star Wars Trilogy were not labelled as the greatest films ever made because of Light Sabres, or Storm Troopers, or groundbreaking motion capture special effects, but because of the human side. The quality of the acting from Sir Alec Guinness, the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, the excellent dialogue that made every line a memorable quote and the context of faith and religion are what made them so everlasting. In this film Ewan McGregor's acting is surprisingly wooden for such a talented actor, Hayden Christensen has less chemistry with Natalie Portman than a 12 year old student's test tube, the dialogue is boring, the lines are cheesy and clichéd, there does not seem to be any actual emphasis on plot, it just being an excuse to glue one over-long action set piece to another, so the intrigue disappears fast and the themes and contexts are given a back seat to (admittedly impressive) CGI. It seems that George Lucas thought that what made a good film was as much soulless eye candy as possible.",0

WHile Obi-Wan never Anikan, he is the only son he will ever have. This father-son dynamic is later mirrored in Jango-Fetts clone story that I don't want to give away, but it's the purrrfect companion story. This movie also features many great side-plots including a small detour that feels leik a noir detective movie. I'd watch a movie about detective Kenobi! Watto also makes a return, and his character has a great arc, and he is very believable. I leik Watto very much. It's amazing that even though Watto is animated, he feels so alive. I wuv it. There's so much great stuff in this movie. Action, adventure, a father struggling to protect his only son from thottery. I'd wuv to say more, but you really just need to see it for yourself. I will say that it's not purrrfect. The computer effects get over-used and can get quite distracting at times, but otherwise I wuv this movie.",1

169,1.0,"The ""Star Wars"" saga always had its faults, with wooden acting, clichéd plots, eye rolling moments, cheap puns, etc. But ""Star Wars"" and its immediate successors also had characters, and one had an emotional investment with those characters. The early effects looked bad (seeing the movie when it first came out in the '70s one thought the Cantina scene looked like a bad Friday night Halloween party). But they had real people moving through real space, often on obvious sets (you can't make an orbiting death star look like anything but a set, so let's cut them some slack). ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Clones"" suffered from the same faults as listed in the first sentence, but ""PM"" had the more egregious faults of the stupid pod-race and the annoying kid. ""Clones"" had so many digital effects it stopped looking like real people inhabiting real spaces, but a cartoon with live-action, like the Toonville of Roger Rabbit. Lucas does effects better than anyone and there are wonderful moments of digital technology in this movie, but creating whole worlds and digital characters makes it look too cartoony, especially when real people leap off buildings or when characters get stuck on some sort of Rube Goldberg conveyor belt. Perhaps it's because ""Clones"" stuck in the middle of a Trilogy, but the storyline went nowhere. And does anyone really give a hang for Anakin or Padme? They're supposed to be the heart of the movie and they feel more like pinballs in George Lucas' great arcade.",0

Meanwhile, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi travels across the galaxy where he then discovers construction of a secret, unauthorized clone army. The story is much more intriguing and has much more depth than Episode One, but it too often drags, and it also suffers from uninspired performances. As always, special effects are a real treat, especially a new and improved Yoda. **½",1

Special Effects can make or break a film, but they can't make it when it's 95% of the movie. Some things that are CGI are upsurd, like Yoda. I'll admit there's no way Frank Oz could have controlled Yoda during his battle scene, but the rest of the movie there is NO excuse for making Yoda CGI. Lucas has developed Gates syndrome, in which he burns money in a fireplace to keep his cats warm.",0

Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace it's now the turn for Attack Of The Clones. I thought the story was more than okay, and that after reading reviews saying the opposite, so no complaint from me here. To me these first two movies were much better than I expected. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. Some people complain about too much CGI's but when it's well done I don't see a problem. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected.",0

176,6.0,"Clones is a slight improvement on the previous prequel The Phantom Menace.It is still heavily bogged down by a multitude of factors such as poor scripting,wooden acting and dizzying use of digital effects.Hayden Christensen as Anakin is far from convincing,his petulance makes him more hormonal teenager than potential Darth Vader.His scenes with Natalie Portman are cringeworthy and lack that deftness of touch inherent to a great acting performance.All the technical and creative problems cast aside,the main problem with Attack Of The Clones and the prequels as a whole for that they are redundant storywise.We know what happens.Gone is the tension and revelation of Empire Strikes Back,digital effects have lost their 'wow' factor and the film suffers badly for investing too much in them.Lucas is however, a man who listens to his detractors,the main comic relief of the previous film,Jar Jar Binks, is almost entirely omitted from this film,surely a reaction to the venomous repsone his over inclusion in 'Menace' provoked,proof indeed that the public gets what the public wants.The sad thing about the quality of these prequels is that they will inevitably tarnish the glowing reputation of the earlier films.Financially,George Lucas will have gained imeasurably from legions of fans aching for more from this galaxy far,far away.Artistically,he will be considered a has-been,out of touch with the modern cinema goer.In summary Attack Of The Clones could probably be better names Attack Of The Digital Effects.",0

These ranking considerations shouldn't matter, nor does the title actually as it doesn't reveal much about the film. But George Lucas who wrote the story knew this was only a build-up into the arc of the most defining character of the saga, Anakin Skywalker, the bridge between the discovery of a young Jedi hope and the tragic surrendering to the Dark side. Clones are tertiary to the plot, it's about a buffer role that the films plays so well it actually overplays it, getting sometimes too 'informative' and serious about these information for its own good. It even reaches the inexcusable point where it gets boring. Say what you want about ""Phantom Menace"", boring it was not.",0

181,8.0,"Viewed as a whole, this film is a melodramatic bore filled with silliness. Hayden rants about sand irritating him and Natalie's lines are even worse, and Lucas had assistance this time with the screenplay. A bounty hunter decides to assassinate the queen with insects, rather then a gun. In an attempt to conceal the death star plans, Count Dooku just slips them in his pocket. There are awe inspiring moments however, the arena fight at the end, combined with the final battle between the Count and Yoda, are fantastic examples of what the rest of the movie should have pulled from. Plot holes are in abundance, and characters are still invisible, but as long as the dazzling effects and impressive sword fights are present, this will always be a worthwhile watch. In conclusion, Lucas should stay away from the writing sector, and should learn what a character is.",0

Second off, Anakin and Obi wan vs Dooku. The fight was great, although short lived, we got to see yoda fight for the first time and it did not disappoint. thirdly, the beginning of anakins anger. Throughout the movie you can see how the anger builds up, in his nightmares of his mom shmi and then the death of his mother. Which i believe was set up by palpatine as a part of his plan, and that his love for padme was starting to interfere with him and his training. lastly, just padme. i mean cmon how can u not enjoy this like padme definitely makes the movie better guys. and for the negatives, all i can say is the cgi is not the best and the romance is a bit overdone. hate this movie? go watch things u may have missed on youtube, points out so many cool things that make rewatching the movie a lot more interesting.",0

Early on there is breath-taking ""sky diving"" scene in an aerial city with Jedi Padwan, Anikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor, a now older Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).

198,6.0,"""Attack of the Clones"" opens 10yrs later and finds Queen, er, Senator Padme Amidala still playing her look alike decoy games even though this surely would've been public knowledge after the events of ""Phantom Menace"". Weak. Then we find Anakin now about 20yo as apprentice to longer haired Obi-Wan but when they meet Padme, love-lorn Anakin goes way off script backtalking Obi-Wan forcing the latter to chastise him in front of everyone. This scene is beyond ridiculous since any such recalcitrant behavior would've been disciplined out of him by this point. So weak. Then the speeder chase scene at night in a lot of multi-level traffic proceeds mishap-free as if there were no other vehicles in sight. Weak. And this is just the opening few minutes! The dialogue is just immature at best, and all Anakin's patronizing ""yes, Master""'ing is so tiresome. When the assailant/fugitive is captured by Obi and Anakin - which btw are neglecting their primary protection duty of Padme - the bounty hunter who hired her darts her dead when he could've as easily darted them! They apparently didn't ""sense"" that danger! There are key story elements that dangle like loose ends. For instance, what is this prophecy of One who will bring the Force back into balance? That was first brought up in Phantom but it's not detailed/described, there's no evidence the Force is out of balance! There's just this unsupported bantering about it. The whole Padme/Anakin dynamic which is supposed to be Jedi protecting a Senator is a dumb romantic courtship. Someone as influential and attractive as Padme would've long been taken by another politician to increase their power structure, but instead we're treated to an adolescent fever dream. The rest of the film suffers from the same half-baked writing and direction, thanks again to an unchecked George Lucas. This is the poor level of storytelling/film-making you get when the same guy is the only executive producer, director, writer, and editor! That's one dude with control issues.",0

I don't care what anyone says, Anakin saying he killed ""not just the men"" always will be a genuinely amazing and heart wrenching performance by Hayden Christiansen. Every other aspect of the movie, I also love: The war on Geonosis is incredible, as are the lightsaber duels with Dooku. Following Obi Wan through his adventure to Kamino was a load of fun and laid the ground work for the republic's army perfectly. The list goes on and on!!! Yes, Anakin was a little bit creepy, and yes a lot of the CGI hasn't aged well. Aside from those two small setbacks, this is an awesome movie that progresses a lot of aspects of the Star Wars story, and most importantly, lays the groundwork of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and rise of Darth Vader.",1

Another faction of viewers might take issue with Anakin Skywalker's evolution from a bratty little eight-year-old to a whining, spoiled teenager (as I'm sure Lucas intended all along). Nevertheless, few can contradict that the clear point of no return was Yoda, now reduced to a CGI. Decently portrayed in The Empire Strikes Back as a wise teacher, the little green guy here is everything and everywhere at once. First he presides over the Jedi Council (ok, I think the whole council thing has been played out about a thousand times over in science fiction). Next we see him teaching Jedi nursery school, going so far as having his pupils greet Ewan MacGregor with ""Helll ohhhh Mass Terrrr Obeeeeee Wannnnn"" as pronounced in younglingspeak. Later on, he appears as a George Patton-like General in the heat of battle, uttering what will surely be the century's most ridiculous line: ""Around the survivors a perimeter create!!!"" erasing any remaining doubt of Lucas's incompetence in writing dialogue.

Those that are not interested would find it harded to get involved or wrapped up in because this movie will leave you asking a lot of question while it answers questions for fans. I personally liked this movie and I found the acting to be just fine. Hayden Christensen does a great job playing Anakin. The whole purpose of his character is to show how such a good kid could be swayed to do evil, to commit evil. Those that critizize the prequels do so because they expect it to be very dark and full of mayhem. Those looking for faults will find it because that's what they are looking for. If there is a criticism that I could levy it is these: 1. this movie is not made for those who know little to nothing about Star Wars. 2. the love story did not have to be so thin. As it stands it seems as if Amidala's affections are in response to her and Anakin's dire circumstances. I am a guy and I still thought some scenes should have been left in order to show some of Amidala's passion giving in to Anakin, a tad more teasing from Amidala to Anakin and vice versa. 3. Show a bit more of Anakin's vengence on the Tusken raiders camp. George Lucas intends for this movie to be darker but I believe he shyed away from this key point to Anakin's psyche here. Another theory I have as to why some are thrilled with AotC and some aren't is who you as the viewer identified with as a child watching the movies. As a child I saw the classic triology through the eyes of Luke Skywalker. Those of you who idetified with Han Solo would be hard pressed to find him in these prequels and for you the saga doesn't live up to what you remembered. There is really no skeptic of the 'Force' in these prequels. In these prequels I identify with Anakin and I wonder how he becomes Darth Vader? That to me is the whole point of the prequels and to me I really do want to see how that innocent little boy becomes so supremely evil. In Episode II there are hints to these machinations in Anakin's head. There is still so much ground to cover for George Lucas in the next installment and as a fan of great movies I can't wait to see it.",1
217,10.0,"A year ago, I reviewed Joe Johnston's much maligned ""The Wolfman"", calling it the most under-appreciated film in cinematic history, praising it for its acting, characters and thematic depth. While ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" isn't AS amazing as ""The Wolfman"", it is one of only a handful of films that can give it a run for its money in the underrated department. I will even go so far as to call it one of the top 100 greatest films ever made. An unpopular opinion, no doubt, but one I fervently believe.",1
218,10.0,This is the second part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.,1
219,8.0,"11 years on from the first episode, we are presented with Episode 2 of the saga, and as realistic as it can be, the actors seem to age since then too, most notably young Anakin Skywalker, who in the Phantom Menace, was casted as Jake Lloyd, is performed by Hayden Christensen. Casting back to 1991 we pictured the droid army, an infinite number of battle droids helping the Trade Federation in their aim to dominate the Galaxy, we are now introduced to a new army for the Republic. Padmé Amidala arrives on Coruscant to vote on the creation of an army to assist the Jedi against the threat posed by a Separatist movement organised by the former a Jedi master Count Dooku. Dooku is a cunning figure, a dominant and evil mystery to viewers, it is never explicitly stated why he was tempered by the Dark side, after being an apprentice himself, under Master Yoda. The villain wears a tightly fitted cloak and his red lightsaber is fitted with a slightly bent casing. His wisdom is still present in his speech and his Jedi attributes are evident in combat, he gathers an immoral nature that makes him so detested, but no one can argue with the smoothness and class he applies to his business. Padmé avoids a narrow assassination upon her arrival to the Republic's capital and is extremely vulnerable, this calls for the protection of Jedi Knight Obi Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker. Bounty Hunter Jango Fett marshalled a second assassination on the Queen, with the assassin being Zam Wesell; in a dramatised chase, she is killed by her employer, a Bounty Hunter, before she reveals her identity. The Jedi Council instruct Obi Wan to find the Bounty Hunter, and have Anakin take Padmé back to Naboo, where he expressing his romantic feelings for her. The pair's romance was hardly hinted at in Episode 1, but both seemed to connect well with one another, and became closer when Anakin travelled with the Starship out of Naboo, at the young age of 9. Obi Wan is lead to the ocean planet of Kamino, discovering the production of an army of clones for the Republic, with Bounty Hunter Jango Fett serving as their genetic template. Obi Wan believes Jango is the Bounty Hunter he is looking to find and asks to meet with him. The Bounty Hunter is situated in a small compact pod, where he lives with his son Boba. Jango and Kenobi battle briefly on a pad outside the quarters, whilst Boba fires up the Hunter's ship, Jango escapes on board and Obi Wan launches a beacon tracker onto the ship, enabling the Jedi to follow them to the planet of Geonosis, a deserted fumed planet, with very little signs of life. Anakin is troubled with visions of his mother Schmi and takes Padmé with him to find her, the two land on Tatooine in order to save her. Watto reveals he sold Schmi to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars, who freed and married her. Cliegg informs Anakin that his mother was abducted by a group of ruthless Tuskan Raiders weeks earlier and most likely dead. Anakin furiously heads towards the Tuskan campsite, finding Schmi tied up, unwell and in desperate need of help. Being still alive, Schmi seems pleased to see her son after so long, but dies, helpless in his arms. The anger develops inside Anakin and brutally destroys every last Tuskan visible on the settlement, later confessing to Padmé that he will do anything he can to protect those he loves. On Geonosis, Obi Wan finds out about a Separatist gathering led by Count Dooku, who is planning the development of a droid army with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Obi Wan reports the information back to the Jedi council, but is subdued by Separatist droids. Senate representative Jar Jar Binks proposes a vote to grant emergency powers to Chancellor Palpatine, the successful outcome allowing the clone army to be authorised. Anakin throughout the film is struggling mentally, in his sleep especially, appearing extremely self-conscious and fears that there is little good in the future, Padmé and Obi Wam the only characters keeping him sane. We see the anger and pain he feels most notably on Tatooine, implicitly stating he has a struggle controlling his emotions. He and Padmé head to Geonosis to save Obi Wan, but are captured by Jango Fett. Dooku sentences the trio to death and have them tied in the centre of a large coliseum to large stumps, soon to be confronted to large beasts. With the arena packed with viewers, along with the Dooku, the beasts are unleashed and head towards their destruction of the three figures; the feast is halted by a battalion of clone troopers, led by Yoda, Mace Windu and other Jedi. Windu, mastered by Samuel Jackson, clutches a purple lightsaber, unusual for a Jedi; in fact it was Jackson who proposed the idea so that in the battle, he could be easily spotted in his act of beheading the Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. And that he did during the ongoing chaos, causing a cry of despair from young Boba who watched from above. When the combat settles, a significant image displays Boba holding the mask of his father, in anguish as if he makes an unwritten agreement to carry on his legacy. Dooku's sudden evacuation is intercepted by Anakin and Obi W Wan, the three engage in a lightsaber duel, Dooku uses his experience to injure Obi Wan and sever Anakin's right arm, but is only greeted by his former master, Yoda. Yoda's withered, small frame slowly walks over to Dooku. Best known for his extreme knowledge of the force and uncommon technique of speech, the green bodied, green lightsabered maestro defends the two wounded Jedi. In an iconic scene, the two ancient individuals battle intensely, until Count Dooku uses Force powers to distract Yoda and flee to Coruscant, where he delivers information for a super weapon to Sith Master, Darth Sidious. Meanwhile, as the Jedi's acknowledge the beginning of the Clone Wars, Anakin is fitted with a robotic hand, secretly marrying Padmé by the waters on Naboo, with C-3PO and R2-D2 witnessing. The film ends with uncertainty for what the Sith will counteract the Clone Army with and questions if Anakin is psychologically well. A film that in my opinion deserved more credit, some great features.",1

221,6.0,"This installment of Star Wars was much better than Episode I which in my opinion was shockingly average. I still felt that George didn't learn his lesson about over using computer graphics indiscriminately from Episode I. Although the effects were more realistic, it still looked fake during good part of the movie. Plot line is pretty strained it seemed. Too many elements had to be crammed into 2 hrs. So there was no interesting plot development for the story or the characters (although, part about a 7ft tall gray alien cloning human soldiers was an interesting plot twist, and the battle scene between Obi-Wan and the bounty hunter was one of the few excellent scenes in this movie). Another annoying thing was that there was too many of everything on CG shots. Too many buildings, too many flying cars, too many people, too many weapons, too many animals, too many foot soldiers, they filled the screen, but at the end of the day, they all looked the same failing to give the cue that we're in a different place, situation or a planet. Aliens looked fake, which also was true for all non-human Jedi council members. Cut back on CGI, focus on plot and acting but as ROTS would show, none of the lessons from making each episodes are carried over on to the next.",0

224,10.0,"Last night I watched SW2 for the first time and I surprised and happy at how well this movie was directed and scripted. There are tiny bits of scenes that could have been re-filmed, but I felt these nuances were minor, in fact these small issues in the film kept the same feeling as the original film, SW4; A New Hope. The musical score was awesome and the ending score of the movie was very well written. I am going to watch this movie again soon but tonight, I am watching SW3 and then back to 5 and 6. I am doing this to prepare myself for the upcoming SW7. I felt SW2 really put all the pieces together for the entire series and explained the forthcoming movies very well. It helped me understand the big picture of the overall storyline.",1
225,7.0,"Watching the story/chapters unfold one by one through George Lucas's eyes is exciting. This film is much better than the titular title lets one. Hayden Christensen is one of the down falls as a teenage Skywalker/Jedi in training, the subtle teen angst or puppy love between Anakin /Queen is dismal. The story of why/where the clones actually come to light is enticing and gives the audience a peek into the dark side of the fallen.",1
226,7.0,"I thought this was a improvement over the phantom menace, but it's still not great, good, but not great, the best actor in this movie is Hayden Christensen as anakin, that moment after Anakin's mom dies in his arms, he gets this look, head down, eyes up, that moment was when Anakin really turned into Darth Vader, them after that, he slaughters every single tusken raider, this movie wasn't great for obvious reasons, but it was great at foreshadowing, so I liked it, I didn't love it, but I liked it.",1
227,10.0,"Unfortunately, I had ruined this movie for myself long before seeing it. Bored one summer, I started looking up a lot of ""spoiler"" information. Thus, I was worried that regardless of how of the film was, I would not be very impressed simply because it would be nothing surprising... ...but whoa, was I so unmistakably wrong! I have never been left speechless by a film, ever. In fact, I figured that people saying that were simply being dramatic. However, I was, in fact, speechless for about 20 minutes after leaving the theatre. George Lucas has truly outdone himself.",0
228,6.0,"Attack of The Clones is generally considered by most to be the worst Star Wars film and overall just a bad film and while I personally wouldn't go that far I think this is an incredibly flawed film that has a few redeeming features mainly to do with the final 30 minutes. This last act is truly fantastic, not only will an Star Wars fan take joy in seeing the true power of the Jedi but it's also just entertaining, the massive battle that has been built up has been extremely well executed and truly gave us a sense of the power of these two opposing forces. The final lightsaber battle of the film while not very intense internally is still fairly well choreographed and made for a somewhat epic conclusion, all the action sequences are very well done I just wish there had been more of them. The performances in this film are a bit of a mixed bad but the one undeniable positive of this entire trilogy is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, he just brings a wise nature yet vulnerability to this already iconic character not only in this film but the trilogy as a whole. However this film still has its fair share of flaws. For one while the last act is riveting and engaging the first two are dull and drab, just dialogue heavy exposition with no real heart or intensity to it, the characters are not built up in any way and the villains are given no motivation or backstory making giving them no really presence. The central romance in this movie just simply does not work mainly because the two actors have very little chemistry due to the poor dialogue and script. Green Screen environments are used frequently in this film and it always shows and comes across as incredibly fake. I really don't like criticising performances but here I have too Hayden Christensen was truly bad in this film, he never really embodied Anakin as a complex character but mainly as just a whiny brat that did not make for a compelling protagonist. This film also sets up some very good ideas or plot lines that are either brushed over or all but forgotten about and came across as lazy at times.",0
229,5.0,"Episode II is just ok. It is not Empire Strikes Back, but it is not The Last Jedi either, in my own opinion. The reason I rated The Last Jedi so low is mostly because of how the movie portrayed Luke Skywalker, but I digress... Attack of the Clones is middle of the road here.",0

232,6.0,"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" wasn't bad but it wasn't good as it was supposed to be. I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan. I was born and raised on ""Star Wars"" so besides George Lucas, I know what's best for the entire franchise. Unlike the original trilogy which anyone can enjoy, This ""Star Wars"" film seemed to be a film that was for the fans only. The story-line and the plot were perfect; it's just that other elements in the film didn't really agree with my ""Imperial"" taste. First of off, some of the goofiness that was in Episode I leaked out into this episode then some of the scenes that were in this film, even though it's science fiction, were a little too far-fetched, for example the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi met up with Dexter Jettster in the diner that looked and sounded like an earthly diner from the 1950s. In a galaxy far far away why would there be a diner that resembles and sounds like an earthly diner from the 1950s just because it's a diner with a sloppy cook and waitresses with a little attitude and the part when the guy with the antennas on his head who tried to sell Obi-Wan some death sticks, I really wasn't feeling that one either. It was things like that that kept this film from being what is was supposed to be. I'm not being biased towards the original trilogy because that's what I'm used to, I'm just telling the honest truth because Episode III was absolutely great!",0

234,2.0,"I've never had a problem with CGI before but after watching Star Wars I feel like the movie beat me over the head with it and then shoved it down my throat. This movie is just a training exercise for CGI students. The character development? Who cares? I mean who can you actually care for in this movie? The dialogue? Horrible. Serious scenes brought tons of laughter from the crowd. And people were nearly falling out in the aisles during Anakin's bad dream sequence from laughing so hard. I guess they needed something to laugh at because this was the most boring, tedious attempt at a storyline ever.",0
235,10.0,"First off, this is a great movie and makes ""The Phantom Menace"" better by explaining things. It does a great job of piecing the prequel puzzle together. Anakin's anger and hate are swelling. The empire is rising. And we all know it's going to happen. The love scences work well because we know it's going to end badly. Anakin really loves Padme and his master Obi-Wan (AS A FATHER YOU PERVERTS) which makes the knowlege that both characters are going to try to kill each other, sad. Fits well in the STAR WARS legacy and after a viewing leaves you itching to see ""Episode III"".",1
236,8.0,"Attack of the Clones is a good, amusing movie about love, action, and drama. This interesting movie is sure to entertain you with the great storytelling, amazing characters, and it's charming ending. I recommend this to anyone who's willing to give this a try.",1

238,10.0,Another amazing episode to the star wars franchise even the genosis colosseum battle was so epic this is a must watch,1
239,10.0,"I'll not provide a synopsis as most people already have or will. Here, you'll find what I liked and didn't. First off, I was impressed but there were some things that are still lacking. Thankfully Jar Jar was only in the film just a bit which has been highly publicized. The film had some good action in it, but it still felt like something was missing and I've come up with the answer, which I'll get to in a moment. The revisit to Tatooine was interesting, as was the 'car' chase. I'm a little annoyed with the Anakin/Padmé story though. There was too much about the romance which would've been fine if it had been deeper or better written. As it was, I was moved to boredom during some of it. Also, Christensen tended to overact leading me to somewhat blanch at his acting. If you take out the love story, and bite the bullet on Christensen's animation, the movie is very good indeed. The visual effects are simply stunning. The new digital Yoda was amazing. I would've never guessed he was digital if I didn't already know it. I kept looking for 'proof' and found it only once when Yoda spoke directly to Padmé. I give the movie 9 stars out of 10. I deduct only one star for the writing in the love story. I won't deduct for the overacting simply because it strikes me that the writing is what may have been the cause. Outside of that, it's an excellent film.",1
240,10.0,"Star Wars fans are always pleased with Lucas' film work. The reason why so many people seem to have a genuine feeling of disappointment with this film is because it is a slow build-up to things that really kick off in the next film Revenge of the Sith. So in order to follow the story, one must sit through such things as the conversations between Senator Palpatine and the Jedi Council or the courtly romance between Anakin and Padme Amidala. Anakin is no longer that same wide-eyed pod-racing champion and is now a Jedi Knight, and furthermore a teenager with a rebellious streak. In this film, we find that Anakin is now probably like 20 years old, he becomes attracted to Padme Amidala (who is supposed to be older than him but looks like she didn't change too much, in fact Anakin is taller than she is). At first, I was under the impression this film would be like Empire Strikes back in mood, tone and romance. Even Revenge of the Sith had more of that feeling. This film is good, make no mistake, full of fine cinematography, music and interesting scenes. The waterfalls of Naboo and the lake retreat are gorgeous to watch, as are the masses of Clones assembling and the starships we later will recognize as Star Destroyers. Yoda is now a full computer graphic designed character (he was still a puppet in Phantom Menace) and is able to fight and win the duel with Count Dooku (played by none other than Christopher Lee of 60's and 70's Dracula films. This is a fine film and worth watching as part of the saga. But yes, as most people seem to agree, the best of the prequels are Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith.",0
241,8.0,"This is the second film in the franchise, and is overall stringer than the first. There is an under-developed love story line, but is saved by the scenes in the Geonosis Droid Factory. It is despised by many people, but some of it is a pleasure to watch. Great film.",1
242,7.0,"I know this film is worse than a 7/10, but for me it brings so many happy memories. The writing is so clunky and horrific, but Ewan McGregor is having such a good time delivering absolute crap that it doesn't even matter. The action is amazing and the CGI characters are still so good. The stakes feel so high for the heroes and the world building is like no other franchise.

245,1.0,"First off, Hayden Christensen (however you spell his name) has emotional constipation, mixed in with some bi-polar attacks of over-acting. I think he is awful for the part of Anakin, soon to be Darth Vader. First of all, Darth Vader is bad-ass. Christensen is a pretty-boy. It just doesn't work. When Anakin and Padmé are at her hidden place, and they're talking about why they can't be together, the way he acts it out is pitiful. On top of that, he whines throughout the whole movie.

Upon returning from the theatre on opening day of this execrable fiasco, my friend asked me what I thought of it. I answered, ""Remember when I said The Phantom Menace was the worst movie of all time? Well, we have a new champion."" Lucas seems bent on redefining the movie-going experience as neither entertaining, thoughtful, uplifting nor fun. I have seen both of the first two ""new"" Star Wars movies, and could not tell you right now what the two sides are, or what they are fighting about. He has turned the battle for good and evil into a CGI version of a 3-hour John Kerry lecture about ""nuance.""

This shows how the clone troopers be came part of the old star wars which was brill and cool as well battle against them and the battle droids was great I feel this movie should get 9 out of 10 for showing love scenes and great battle scenes and Yoda with his light saver great job and for having him on action with his light saver I hope they show his light saver again in the TV series which comes out in 2011 lets hope he has it I have got this movie out on DVD and along with eps 1 and 3 cool some day I would do a remake scene with c3po with his head coming that would be great over all great movie 9 out of 10,1
251,7.0,"Attack of the Clones is SO much better than Episode I, I can not even begin to count the ways.  The first and most important change is the toned down Jar-Jar.  This is without a doubt the WORST Lucas creation, and I was VERY happy to see he didn't have much screen time.  Another change was the use of the Jedi council, especially Yoda.  I was EXTREMELY impressed by the battle between Yoda and Duku.  Although, I would have liked it to be longer, I think it was GREAT to see Yoda in action.  The third good thing about this movie was that it made the plot in Episode I at least marginally understandable.  And the fourth change was the ditching of the whole midiclorian thing.  This was another of Lucas' worst decisions. ",0
252,10.0,Star Wars II attack of the clones is a nicely done film. George Lucas once said he saw the three films as part of a biography in the life of Anakin Skywalker.

I am not sure how good teenage Darth Vader is as an actor, but I choose to believe that his stiffness and occasional awkwardness were signs of youth and hints of a flawed personality that would later allow him to become the evil James Earl Jones. I see they could not resist making a large number of the Jedi knights female, I guess to make certain little girls would also buy toy light sabers but it did not have a major impact on the credibility.

268,6.0,"The second part of the prequels trilogy of Star Wars looked to me, in the first two acts, as a boring movie, but not THAT boring. The romance between Anakin and Padmé was not well written by George Lucas, who's not helped that much delivering some bad dialogues, as the classic ""I don't like sand"", and the acting of Hayden makes it everything worse, but it's not his fault, looks hard to act out from the dialogues he have. The plot of Kenobi tracking down Jango Fett is okay, nothing special, nothing really that interesting, the designs of Kamino and Geonosis are... meh, but the character of Jango Fett is fine and that's all. The real magic happens in the third act. Count Dooku, who Christopher Lee plays perfectly, the return of the Trade Federation, and the plans of the Separatists are revelead then. The Battle of Geonosis is great, and I don't really minded at all the outdated CGI, but what really made it everything even better was the battle of Count Dooku vs Kenobi and Anakin, and later on Dooku vs Yoda. Really liked how the Force was used, the coreography, it was great from the beginning to the end. And the plot twist, if this is the right term, was great, but not that surprising. Attack of the Clones is a good movie, but reafirms the fact that the original trilogy is better, as we are close to the end and the two movies that passed was just okay.",0

We know how you feel, Anakin. Am I the only one who thought this was actually worse than the Phantom Menace? I don't remember anything about the plot of that film but I remember feeling mildly entertained. This was just plain boring. From the high-speed chase in the city to the weird tall thin aliens to the political assassination attempt it all felt like a TV spin-off of the Fifth Element without the famous actors, the beautiful models, the slick direction, the humour, the dialogue or the fun. The waterfalls in the background on Naboo looked like the tongue-in-cheek idyllic backdrop on a Kraftwerk CD. The gladiatorial scene was straight out of your first Dungeons & Dragons game. The big battle at the end was SO BORING people were leaving their seats and returning ten minutes later... they'd probably gone outside for a cigarette. The acting and the dialogue would, by and large, not have passed muster on a Mexican soap opera; the most interesting part of Natalie Portman's performance was the surprise appearance of her nipples. On the plus side: Yoda drew some genuine laughs with his ""kung fu"" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a bit too fanciful for my liking. Ewan McGregor's effort was good considering the material, and his fight with Jango Fett should put him in the running for a role as 007. But what this franchise really needs to do is bring back Harrison Ford... perhaps Han Solo was a clone?",0

Before I dive into 'The Mandalorian' and eventually the everlong 'Clone Wars' series, I'll be rewatching some of the feature films to cement my ranking of the 'Skywalker Saga' (my top 4 and bottom 2-3 are rigged in place). So why not start off with a bang and say that I've come back around to reliking 'Attack of the Clones'? Although 'Revenge of the Sith' and to some extent the whole prequel trilogy hold a place of nostalgia for many, the only one that I believe touches the sky is of course, 'Revenge of the Sith'. 'The Phantom Menace', while not awful, remains a tedious watch due to its slog handling of the political storylines, a bulk of its plot being an uninteresting slow burn that merely provides some building blocks for the future episodes. 'Episode II' thankfully provides a lot of payoff as its own contained chapter before 'Episode III', and it's far more engaging and interesting despite being clumsy at times.",1

This film is one of the cooler looking Star Wars films especially when it comes to introducing new planets and environments.

However, the acting and dialogue especially toward the middle of the film is just so poor it holds back what is really a pretty good intro and conclusion. Thankfully, the cringey romance is inter-cut with a really intriguing mystery aspect to the plot so the pacing doesn't suffer too much. That being said the really poor dialogue in the romance embodies what certain critics hate about the prequels and really holds back the rest of the movie (which is really quite good) from being one of the really good star wars films. However, everything else about this movie is honestly great. Count Dooku is meanacing. The Jengo hunt is intriguing as heck. And the finale is the colosseum is one of my favorite star wars scenes.

315,8.0,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the second installment in the prequel trilogy of the Star Wars Saga, released back in 2002. Set ten years after Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is the apprentice to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), the former apprentice of Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former Queen of Naboo, is now a Senator of the Galactic Republic, and Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In this episode, Anakin and Obi-Wan are commissioned by the Jedi Council to protect Senator Amidala from an assassination plot. In the process, Obi-Wan is sent to the mysterious world of Kamino, where he will learn of the Grand Army of the Republic that will assist the Jedi in the Battle of Geonosis and encounter the dangerous bounty hunter Jango Fett and his son, Boba; Anakin must go with Padme to Naboo as her protector and, eventually, they end up falling in love, something that is forbidden for Anakin. Like I stated in my review for Episode I, once again, Episode II did everything it was supposed to: introduce us to the Clone Troopers (who will eventually become the Storm Troopers), reveal the epic beginning of the Clone Wars, and show Jedi Master Yoda in action vs Count Dooku (Christopher Lee)!!! I'll say this though, the thing that I don't like about this episode is that there is no real action until Obi-Wan engages in combat with Jango Fett. The love story really slows things down. Other than that, Episode II was pretty enjoyable. John Williams' ""Across the Stars"" was a great theme for the movie. That was probably the one thing that kept me interested the first half of this movie when I saw this in theaters. Lack of action throughout and poor acting by Anakin Skywalker is why this doesn't get a 10 from me! Rating: 8/10!!!",1

The most interesting moment for the upcoming events (Anakin's mother death, Padme and Anbakin's romance) are free from digital effects known as CGI, meanwhile the most thrilling moments are full of them (like that chase inside the factory of droids, the real attack of the clones, Obi Wan trying to get Jango Fett). The Star Wars movie for the new generation of fans, is good even in the making of the poster., with such a simple design and effective results. And thank god that Sma Jackson gets a bigger, cooler and better part in this movie as the master Mace ""I am so cool"" Windu. The Yoda/Dooku showdown is unrateable, so there it goes.

The last forty-five minutes of the production includes an extremely breathtaking war between good and bad, leading to an awesome fight between Yoda and Count Dooku What I have exemplified in the first two sentences, are the positive aspects of this film: The special effects, and the last forty five minutes. Unfortunately, the negative points (in my opinion) are quite noticeable. The acting is not as effective as it could be, and is inspired by a stilted script which contains only some potential humor and zero possible romance. The love story is too rash and somehow wrong even though Portman and Christensen are apparently good actors. Ewan McGregor is okay as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but could add more emotion into his role. What I thought to have been a big improvement however (which other people savoring the older trilogy may disagree with) is the CGI version of Yoda. He looks less funny than how he did as a complex puppet and has many more kid fans now.

For the first time since the Empire Strikes Back the trilogy really focused on the mysteries of the Force and really gave viewers a gutsy well written story. I have read critics who have lambasted the movie as having campy dialogue and less than stellar acting. I am a regular movie goer and know the original trilogy by heart and if the reviewers that were critical of this movie had actually watched the movie as a continuation of the same story or a preface to the original series, those reviewers would see that this movie comes much closer to the vision of the earlier movies. Lets face it folks, when it comes time for the Academy Awards, the Star Wars movies win on technical merit as well as musical accompaniament. I am sure these same critics are the ones that complained about the Lord of The Rings as a chase movie. Well duh, if they had read the book, they would have known that.",1

336,8.0,My Take: A flawed love story can't undermine this 2nd STAR WARS prequel. ,0
337,8.0,"Because it's Star Wars, I think viewers don't see this as just another movie, but tend to micro-analyze everything. Since I don't really care that much about Star Wars, compared to something more serious such as 'Shadowlands' or any one of a hundred other movies, I think this movie comes off really well. It's gorgeous to watch, especially the imaginative scenic renderings of the different planets. The acting is quite credible, the storyline has way more dramatic tension than you'd normally expect in sci-fi, and there's an ominous brooding presence I find quite amenable to our lives and the times. So I give this an 8/10 (only a very few of my ratings get up this high).",1
338,1.0,"How else would he have managed to convince the world at large this is any good. The special effects were amazing but we expect that by now, the action scenes were good but once again they always are, the acting was so non-existent I don't think the actors could have been trying, The dialogue was sub-standard even for Lucas and the story was weak. Lucas clearly set out to impress the fans by including R2-D2 and C3PO in much bigger roles even though this throws up huge plot holes like why do none of the characters from the original trilogy remember encountering these droids who help them save the universe, it appears Lucas doesn't realize that you can't make a prequel unless it makes sense of the original in the same way you can't have a sequel that doesn't make sense of the film it follows on from. Why doesn't he get some proper writers like Laurence Kasdan in again and is he still trying to convince us that he always intended there to be 9 parts and had them planned out from the start which is quite frankly an obvious lie.",0
339,5.0,"After The Phantom Menace was a massive disappointment, Fans hoped that Attack Of The Clones would be an improvement. First the positives, The performances by McGregor, Lee, and Jackson are great, Some visuals are cool, Jar-Jar is barley in it, The Lightsaber duels are still fun, and the Clones are fairly interesting. Unfortunately, Attack Of The Clones is actually worse than The Phantom Menace with a performance from Hayden Christensen that is Twilight levels of bad (I don't blame the actor, I blame Lucas's script), The dialogue is more wooden here, The romance between Anakin and Padame is poorly executed and cringeworthy, And the CGI is overused to death with some noticeable green screen. Overall, Attack Of The Clones is the worst Star Wars film to date.",0
340,9.0,"Like i put for TPM, don't try and link this to the originals.

I big Star Wars fan, and what makes me a fan is that I like the movies, seriously most Star Wars fans hate Star Wars.<br /><br />As I got older I think I prefer it to The Phantom Menace and Solo.<br /><br />The worst aspect of the movie is the romance between Anakin and Padmé it is poorly written and badly acted, mostly be Hayden Chrsitianson. But I have come to enjoy it over the years at the pure stupidity of the dialogue. I think the basic outline of the story of Anakin being the protector and them getting drawn into a larger adventure is not the problem and if it was executed well could have been a better part of the movie.<br /><br />Though the best quality of the movie is the action. The speeder chase, the fight between Obi wan and Jango Fett, and the entire battle of Geonosis. All of these are superior to the Pod Racing scene and the duel of fates sequence.<br /><br />Both the deception of the Emperor and failure of the council, display the intriguing politics of the world of the late republic.<br /><br />Another positive is the first steps toward his decent to the dark side. Ewan McGreggor as Obi Wan is one of the greatest parts of the trilogy as a whole.<br /><br />But the main reason I am draw to it is that it is Star Wars and that is usually just enough for me to nerd out and pick up on the small nerdy details and will push the movie over the edge of being great.",0
343,7.0,"The second entry in George Lucas' new Star Wars trilogy rises above it's predecessor with better dialogue, less Jar Jar, a spry Yoda, and overacting good enough to make Hayden Christenson the perfect father of Mark Hamill. While this movie, which shows Anakin's resentful tendencies and introduces the clone army that will dethrone the Republic, is better than the mediocre Phantom Menace, it does not even reach Return of the Jedi standards. While the writing is better in this entry, the love story between Padme and Anakin is so painfully dumb and childish that it almost destroys the other improvements. The biggest problem continues to be the lack of a villain to match Vader and the utter predictability of it all. Yoda becomes the star when he starts doing summer salts and makes Dooku tuck tail. Why wasn't that in Episode One? If George Lucas can make Episode III as much of an improvement over Episode II, as Episode II is over Episode I, fans may finally get the ride that they have been waiting twenty-two years to experience.",0
344,9.0,"Episode II may not be entirely perfect, but still, it is a huge improvement compared to the last one. Fans will cheer over the fact that Jar Jar Bink's screen time has been chopped in two, although he does play a major part in a crucial scene concerning the power of the Chancellor. Fans will know this signals the beginning of the Clone Wars, and the end of the Republic. I appreciate the film's darker tone. Anakin is now played by Hayden Christensen, who in my opinion portrayed the more 'sinister' side of Skywalker. Much enjoyed.",1
345,8.0,"** minor spoilers** After a slight downfall with the Phantom Menace, George Lucas and Co. get back on track with Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The love story was extremely dissapointing, and it didn't develop much at all. The action was solid, as was the special effects. Hayden Christiansen performed solidly, as did Natalie Portman. I especially enjoyed the ending of the film, although it was abrupt. Although the second trilogy so far is lacking compared to the original (second), this film is very entertaining. Episode III should be the best one yet out of this new trilogy.",1
346,7.0,"I think people are overly harsh concerning these movies. A lot of people complain about the use of CGI vs. modeling in the original trilogy, but this is a bunch of bull. If Lucas had the capability to use CGI in the first trilogy, he definitely would have used it. The only reason that he didn't use it was that he couldn't, so instead he spent an inordinate amount of time creating set pieces and large-scale miniatures of ships (Milennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Star Destroyers, the Death Star). This must have cost an absolute fortune, not to mention that the manpower effort to realize his visions must have been staggering. And while I agree that the use of models has allowed those movies to stand up to the test of time (I recently watched the trilogy on DVD for the first time in years), I still think there is a lot of good stuff in this installment. The CGI is amazing, particularly the sequence showing the rescue of Anakin, Obi Wan and Amidala on Tatooine. I thought Yoda's fighting sequence was well-done (he's the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy - why is this so unbelievable?) And the chase with Obi Wan and Anakin trailing the would be assassin through the skyways makes the similar scene in the 5th element look like a coarse little flip-book (a movie which has a higher score on this site). The acting was a deterrent - especially in depicting the love story of Padme and Anakin. Gone is Liam Neeson, but added was Christopher Lee, a favorite of mine. Unfortunately this incarnation of Anakin is highly annoying, much more so than the boy from Ep. 1. I simply could not accept that Amidala would fall in love with this immature, arrogant little punk for a second. Still, I give the movie an 8. People's expectations are way too high for these movies, mostly because of the phenomenon the original series spawned. I think it is unfair to judge these movies in this way, but rather to take them as they are without trying to constantly compare them to the originals. The originals are obviously superior, without doubt; however the originals are also some of the greatest movies ever made, and to expect the same this time around is unfair; it is difficult to catch lightning in a bottle once, let alone 6 times - Lucas managed to do it 3 times with the original movies, and while these are not on the same level, they are enjoyable nonetheless. 7 of 10",1
347,9.0,"Firstly, may I say (perhaps somewhat cynically) that obviously George Lucas has done some market research after the floppery that was Star Wars I - and in his next instalment has given audiences what they were really after. Yes, gone (for the most part) are Jar Jar Binks and the muffin-head kid playing Anakin Skywalker. Instead, we have a cast worthy for a prelude to the original Star Wars movies.",0
348,7.0,Sometimes things work sometimes they don't.  Although Episode I was not what diehard Star Wars fans were looking for it did have it's moments.

Phantom Menace would have been better without Jar Jar Binks but I would still rate that viewing experience as positive also. The dislike for this film may be explained by the bandwagon effect. It's become popular to bash Star Wars. If you forget the first three films, after all this is a separate trilogy, there is some good stuff. The special effects are superb, the acting salvages most of the dialogue and the plot moves along at a respectable clip. The viewer is left with a sense of foreboding over what is to come in episode three.",1
354,2.0,"I did not think it is possible, but George Lucas has somehow excreted a sequel that manages to make the lameness of The Phantom Menace look like high art. At this point, it seems very clear that Lucas, irate that fans have pigeon-holed him into a niche as the auteur responsible for adventures in a galaxy far, far away, are going to seriously pay for it. And what better way than for Lucas to simply take a dump all over the opening trilogy that he has promised to provide for years? Attack of the Clones becomes the latest casualty of Lucas' incompetent writing and direction resulting in a much-awaited sequel that viewers hoped would improve on the problems of its predecessor, but instead finds entirely new ways to exploit and exacerbate them. The plot – such as it is – picks up roughly 10 years after the last film. Anakin Skywalker is now a strapping young man and acolyte of Jedi Master Ben Kenobi, who gets assigned as a glorified bodyguard to former Queen Amidala (now Senator Amidala), while Kenobi goes off in search of the supposed clone army of the title. There are a number of plot holes and inconsistencies as well as developments that simply fail to effectively dovetail with what viewers already know from the original trilogy. For instance, there is nothing especially heroic or admirable about the Jedi Knights as depicted in this film. They seem to be a suspiciously virginal monastic order with particular disdain for both emotions and outsiders – and they are almost laughably incompetent. They are constantly taken by surprise by enemies in their midst and most action scenes will be marked by a stretch where the Jedi participating will somehow lose their lightsabre during the battle. Yet their dialog – especially that as delivered by Samuel L. Jackson and the increasingly tiresome Yoda – is delivered with a smug self-righteousness that crosses the border of hypocrisy into arrogance. Also interesting is that Lucas fails to give us any reason as to why Amidala would be a target of assassination attempts since she brings nothing conceivable to the table to be a threat to anyone. It all functions as little more than a plot contrivance to throw Anakin and Amidala together for Lucas' ham-fisted idea of a romance. As though suddenly realizing that he needs to maneuver the future parents of Luke and Leia together, Lucas conspires painful passages awkwardly inserted into the story where we are supposed to see their relationship developing to a point where both parties buck the rules to become married. The film also continues to suffer from the lack of a good villain. Christopher Lee shows up late in the game as a sinister character called Count Dooku, but it impossible to tell in the mishmash of a story whether his goals are ultimately good or bad. Would that the attention Lucas has lavished on his overabundance of phony-looking CGI effects had been aimed at the story. C-3PO and R2-D2 are back, but used badly – especially in a concluding conveyor belt action scene that results in C-3PO's head being placed on an attack droid's body with assorted crummy one-liners in accompaniment. The various alien cultures that Lucas presents are not remotely imaginative and saddled with notable stereotypical English dialects. Ewan McGregor holds himself with a bit of dignity as Ben Kenobi, so it is a shame that Lucas has yet to write him a good role. Samuel L. Jackson's macho tough guy shtick is past its shelf life. Natalie Portman seems to become increasingly more catatonic as Amidala (her scene after falling out of a copter is high unintentional comedy). Poor Hayden Christensen has it the worst. He is stuck with the impossibly daunting task of eliciting audience sympathy for an anti-hero whose character arc is already known to the audience, trying to convince us that he is hopelessly enchanted with his wooden leading lady, and that he actually has a degree of mentor/student chemistry with McGregor, all while being saddled with bargain basement dialog that makes the central character seem little more than a shallow, petulant brat. He manages a couple of nice moments where he hints of the darkness to come, but is largely crushed by the Lucas ball of ineptitude. In the director chair, Lucas seems to have no idea how to generate suspense or pace the film in an effective manner. In fact, it often seems that the film functions as barely more than a showcase for his CGI effects studio. A dismal wreck that truly has completely derailed what should have been a far more promising and durable series.",0

It's got some great sfx, fabulous fight sequences and some really interesting characters, except for the two main leads, that is!! Hayden Christansen is as wooden as they come!!

George, if you're out there, mate! leave the directing to people who know their craft! I saw this at the midnight screening in Newcastle's Showcase City Cinemas..great turnout, the theatre was packed out and plenty of applause all-around and for one particular scene in the climax..You gotta watch it and you'll love it too!!

This one is much the same but the battle scenes are more exciting and the story is starting to emerge in its connection to the originals. The battle scenes are fun to watch and the romance scenes on Naboo are great, but the characters are simply not as inspired as the first trilogy. The film seems personal but the characters seem rather impersonal. Some of this is good and some is dull, but Lucas does manage to keep us wanting for his third installment somehow.

The movie surpasses all but Empire in overall quality, and I (a diehard Star Wars fan) believe the action to be the best of the 5 movies produced to date.

Now on to my review:  George Lucas has done it again!  This is his crowning achievement so far, and it's only gonna get better!  I know a lot of people didn't like the acting or the dialogue, but to the fans this was beyond a masterpiece.  This movie far surpasses everything in the previous trilogy with sound and visuals.  Granted, George Lucas sticks to a certain formula, but if the shoe fits... I feel that the acting in the movie was not as bad as most have said, and the dialogue is standard Star Wars.  There is no way around it.  George Lucas has his method of doing things and he's not gonna change.  For every Star Wars fan that thought this movie was bad look at it this way: My wife is ABSOLUTELY NOT a Star Wars fan, but she liked this one! If a non-fan can like it, why can't everyone who claims to be loyal?

The final battle on Planet Geonosis is indicative of this problem, as we watch hordes of Storm Troopers flying in spaceships blasting away at the enemy's spherical vehicles, resulting in bright, fluorescent explosions.

Hayden Christensen was good as the soon-to-be evil Anakin. The dialogue was acceptable (yes there were some cheezy lines, but hey what about Lord of the Rings?) Oh and Christopher Lee is the master of evil. He was excellent. And Yoda, move over Ah-nold, Stallone etc. thus nearly 2 million year old man has out done you.

If you want a non-stop action movie, this wont give it to you.  There are several action scenes, all of which are great and does what a movie should do, give you enough that you beg for more, but not so much that it overdoes it.  The first hour or so does more to expand the SW universe than any of the other movies.  This has restored my faith in PT (prequel trilogy), and AOTC actually makes TPM much better.

382,5.0,"A long time ago, in a galaxy not a million miles away from our own, Geroge Lucas made 'Star Wars'. Optimisitcally subtitled 'A New Hope', the film was an old fashioned, good-versus evil, rollicking adventure, with a cracking storyline and groundbreaking special effects. The huge success of the movie is widely believed today to have had a massive impact on Hollywood as a whole; but in a more local context, a direct consequence was the release of two sequels (though Lucas left the direction of these to others). Sequel number one, 'The Empire Strikes Back', added a layer of darkness to the story, but also a layer of pretension, and the episodic plot seemed to do little more than occupy the space between the first film and the third. And by the time of number three ('The Return of the Jedi'), it appeared that the concept was running out of steam; although still a huge box-office success, nothing new was offered to the audience except the abominably cuddly Ewoks. Even more worrying was that Lucas seemed prouder of the Ewoks than he was of the movie, and he was to spend some effort in the subsequent years attempting to promote them as the future of family entertainment. 'Star Wars', however, was placed firmly on the back-burner, and vaguely mentioned plans for three promised ""prequels"" appeared to be buried.",0

People are not reviewing the movie; they are maliciosly attacking it with their bias and ignorance. In case you haven't noticed- Clones is very much like a modern American, sci-fi take on a Kurosawa film- see Ran. This film is NOT Hollywood product; that's why the pacing seems awkward to some. It is the most expensive INDEPENDENT movie ever made. Their is a method to George Lucas's madness. Stop second guessing him. The so called plot holes actually are part of the grand scheme of the prequel trilogy. Stop focusing on the negatives and ripping everything to shreds. Stop obsessing over dialogue; there's more to movies that dialogue, after all the CINEMA began as a silent experience. 1 out of 10?! Anyone that really believes that is either extremely ignorant about film or a vicious hater of Star Wars now that it doesn't fit their preconceived notions of what the prequels should be. Attack of the Clones, after all is said and done, will be remembered as a great chapter in the greatest film series ever. And, anyone who says otherwise, I'll argue with you till the death.",1

390,8.0,"Fcae it: Whether you love it or hate it, Attack of the Clones has the heart of a 70's auteur masterpiece. You know: The Godfathers, the Chinatowns, the Apocalypse Nows. Obviously, it doesn't share their subject matter, but in principle, they are close cousins. They are all about SOMETHING. Yes; Attack of the Clones is really about something. There are deep (and some disturbing) themes that run through George Lucas' latest: forced abandonment of family for the greater good, the death of democracy, etc. Attack of the Clones is not just ""some silly sci-fi cartoon."" It captures more of the 70's trailblazing spirit of filmmaking than Return of the Jedi did. Even the acting in some ways is a tribute to the 70's. Doesn't Natalie Portman's acting style somewhat resemble Diane Keaton's acting style in The Godfather; come on: you KNOW what I'm talking about. Clones is not perfect, but it is very good and does not deserve the critical hatred it receives. Rasberrie for worst film of the year: that is an insult to all the talent that was invloved in the making of the film. Many of us now realize this film is great, but most will not understand this until Episode 3 is released when ""the circle will be complete.""",1
391,7.0,"Honestly this movie is a lot of issues. Sure it has some good parts and stuff, which put at 8th place above phantom menace, but even then that's barely. Let's start off with that the very first part of the film is forgettable because of the senate scenes. I will go back to this later, but for now the the underworld plot thread. It's not that great, it's basically okay on concept and paper, but it's not good in execution because it's so under developed and like it's there but just disappears into another plot. I wished it was explored more. My next point is about the character. It's not that great in individual scenes but in the entire movie it's alright which in itself is bad. Honestly the whole this plot thread and character development connects to the whole problem with the prequels is George sort of forces the world building. We already got the world building in the original trilogy so I don't we need a world building like this but if he wanted to he could've had some of movies feel connected. Which also brings up the concept point that everybody Hass which is that George it's got a concept but bad at execution which is totally true. Now on to the senate scenes. Wow these scenes just so cringe/boring that it really takes away from the underworld plot thread and. The scenes basically just throw politics at you instead of having breaks that really make since and make you invested with the politics. George should've know better. My next point is about the love scenes, they are so cringe. It's basically toxic high school love mixed with childish love as well (I mean high school love is childish whatever). Honestly George should've not forced it at all. This brings me to how he handles anakin. Anakin is very annoyed at the stuff the Jedi council and obi wan do, but it's not really that great and what would've worked us flashbacks that would've gave us skywalkers pad wan years before atoc to see why he is this way. Also could've had padme be like more in a say in stuff anakin talks (yes she sort of dose to an extent which brings me to my next point). I feel padme is a little bit better than phantom menace padme. A lot of people probably disagree with me on this, but I think the acting that natalie Portman has is good, yes it's dry, but it's a little bit better than anakin. It's probably because of George's why of handling dialogue. I think that there should've been flashbacks of qui-gon and dooku sprinkled in in the movie, but mainly have in it in the duel at the end with dooku vs anakin obi wan and yoda, which brings me to my next point, the duel. This duel has a problem it has no good breathing room when dooku, obi wan, and anakin fight expect for maybe yoda vs dooku but still has some bad breathing room. All I think they could've done is have obi wan fight dooku first than have anakin fight next so that we can have a flashback about dooku and qui-gon. Maybe have it in yoda vs dooku as well, which brings me to my next problem, which is the ending of yoda and dookus duel. It felt very rushed and like dooku just run away like a coward which he is sort of a coward but that's not the point. The point is they could've had dooku be like you will see your downfall soon Jedi or something like that just keep the Jedi at edge. Another problem is there's not enough bad guy scenes. All I wanted was more scenes with the bad guys but where we get spoiled of order 66. Honestly that's all of my complaints and stuff. Why I put this above phantom menace is because of the end battle, kamino/clones, and the sith plot. There's one thing I would've is more tension between obi wan and jango but that's it. I think 7 is a fair score since it's still a good Star Wars but had so massive flaws.",0
392,7.0,"I had heard that Episode II was better than the Phantom Menace and I will agree with that appraisal. Unfortunately that is not saying a whole heck of a lot. The first three Star Wars movies were awesome and each one carried it's weight. It is hard to beat perfection and I am afraid that it shows in both of the prequels. I found the acting extremely wooden and uninspiring. I am not a huge fan of the casting in the first place and that is even more obvious in this film. Jimmy Smits?? What the heck were they thinking??!! Samuel Jackson is bad enough. Thankfully they went light on Jar Jar Binks but in all honesty any scene with this annoying character is enough to make one beg for mercy. I was hoping that Jar Jar would meet his end but you will have to see for yourself. I found most of this film slow moving and uninspiring. When you find yourself looking at your watch all the time this is not a good sign! I will admit that the last 20 minutes of the film are very well done. But when a movie has two hours preceeding that said 20 minutes, you get the picture. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars but at this point I am wishing George Lucas had only made three films, and left the rest in his imagination. One can only watch so many scenes with strange creatures and space ships and computer generated imagery and this is getting to the point of overkill. I could easily tell what was ""real"" and what was CGI and even Matte paintings. All in all I found the movie a real bore and would not recommend it to anyone. For real action and adventure try SpiderMan or The Scorpion King. Attack of the Clones should have been called Attack of the Drones!",0
393,10.0,"Even if you hate this film, you have to realize that it follows brillentally with the art of a great trilogy. Howard Stern said it best in his complaint ""It doesn't go anywhere"" well it's not really suppose to really go anywhere it's the second part in the Prequels and second part of the saga. The story evolves the saga into the teenage mood swings of Anakin, his evil and good events along with his lack of control. We also grow into Obi-Wan Kenobi as a more mature teacher struggling to pass on idea's of his old mentor while his student is recklessly pushing him away. There's Padme who is in a life crises, falls in love with a past hero, even though he is bad news and very obsessive. Then there is Y-O-D-A, in need not say more. Attack of the Clones follows the Star Wars formula into a fantastic space fantasy. A movie that has witty dialogue; sometimes it's stall, but that gives it quality. Overall, it is not perfect and it is not for everyone, but it is good clean fun!",1

395,9.0,"Attack of the Clones is another great film produced by George Lucas. This one is truly underrated with great performances, save for Christensen. The Battle of Geonosis is a technical achievement, blending CGI with practical effects. In fact, this film uses more practical effects than the original trilogy combined. The lightsaber fights are mostly entertaining too, while the film's only true major flaws being that some of the effects are dated and the romance. Don't forget John Williams' legendary score that is one of his best works.",1

399,3.0,"(3/10) Star Wars II was predictably bad. The special effects were up to the high standard of the original and it was visually very nice, but George Lucas can't write scripts for toffee. Looking at the bio for co-scriptwriter Jonathan Hales - a string of made-for-TV spin-offs and the Scorpion King - one gathers he wasn't much help either - sadly we are to be sentenced to more of this collaboration on SWIII. Perhaps Ewan McGregor will have invested some of his relatively new found wealth in acting lessons by the time shooting begins in 2003? (He left London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama before even graduating). McGregor's boy-next-door Scottish charm is ok to land some nice juicy parts but I would like to see him play someone other than McGregor now he's got them. I can barely distinguish the ""lovable"" McGregor in Moulin Rouge from the vocally-challenged McGregor in Black Hawk Down or the now-I-get-to-play-a-super-hero McGregor in  Clones Attack. Maybe they are all clones. Maybe Lucas will ask the Wachowski (Matrix) brothers or James Cameron (Terminator, Aliens, Strange Days) or even Iain M Banks to help him write a script. May pigs will learn to fly like cgi's . . .",0

The ending was especially good though. The Jedi defending themselves against the mass-armed droids and other aliens. We finally see the Clones and how they are generated. The final climax and duel between Yoda and Count Dooku was magnificent however short. Alas, we still don't know the identity of Darth Sidious; moreover you see him on at the end.

Many of the scenes were more interesting because I understood what a SW fan is supposed to.  I think if some of the people who have shown lukewarm feelings toward Episode II rewatch it after seeing Episode III when all is revealed, they will allow themselves some oohs and aahhs.

""Attack of the Clones"" has lots of action, but it's never really moving in any way. It has lots of visual effects and perhaps the most sophisticated sound effects ever, but the love for details shown in these departments is sadly missed when it comes to characters and story. That's nothing really new with the ""Star Wars""-movies, but it's sad in this case, where beauty and greatness could have been easy to achieve. Part of the reason for that is the shallowness of Hayden Christensen, who doesn't have enough to offer in order to let us believe he's suffering - let alone the ability of sharing his turmoil. Natalie Portman is way over Christensen's head when it comes to acting, and it would have required a really good actor like Tobey Maguire to make those love scenes work.",0

At some points it seems that he can't remember how to direct real actors either, so caught up as he is in the digital revolution.

446,8.0,"Writer & director George Lucas takes more chances in ""Star Wars: Episode Two: Attack of the Clones"" than he has since his first sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in 1980. The second prequel in the popular Twentieth Century Fox film franchise surpasses the adolescent antics of ""Episode One,"" but defies expectations. First, Lucas and co-scenarist Jonathan Hales of ""The Scorpion King"" weave a darker, thematically richer, far more elaborate tale of deception and intrigue. Second, the stormy relationships between Jedi wannabe Anakin Skywalker (newcomer Hayden Christensen whose striking resemblance to James Dean adds to his stature), his Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor of ""Trainspotting""), and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman of ""The Professional"") lack both the usual charisma and warmth. Third, while some ""Star Wars"" fans may rank ""Episode One"" above ""Episode Two,"" the latter neither panders to instant gratification nor glib evasions of moral obligations as in ""Spider-man."" New characters bristle with greater ambiguity, and a serviceable storyline contains enough surprises. For the record, ""Episode Two"" occurs ten years after ""Episode One."" During that decade, Obi-Wan has instructed hot-tempered Anakin in the ways of a Jedi knight. Senator Amidala, previously the Queen of Naboo, lands on the planet Coruscant to address the Republic about the political unrest in the galaxy. Predictably, assassins line up to kill Amidala. Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Fresh"") appoints Obi-Wan and Anakin to serve as her bodyguards. Basically, ""Episode Two"" begins as a mystery thriller, and then chronicles Anakin's forbidden romance with Amidala on Naboo and his tragic descent to the Dark Side.",1

449,8.0,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones(2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline takes place ten years after the first film as Anakin's powers have grown immensely and so has his ego. He is also obsessed with Padmé Amidala. Obi-Wan tries to keep him focused and humble but that only makes Anakin more rebellious. Things get complicated when an assassin has been hired to kill Padmé Amidala. Anakin and Padmé are assigned to protect her by the Jedi which will make controlling Anakin's emotions even more challenging.,1

Contains all that we might expect in an adventure-science fiction movie of the 21st century; Action, thrills, comedy, romance and tears (drama) ...not to mention the superb special effect throughout the entire film. But a perfect 10 it's not. There's still too much Disney over the two droids. In short; the movie is still not dark enough (and who knew R2D2's capabilities were THIS advanced...?). At first I thought the lines spoken by Anakin and Padmé, when they were alone, were very un-original, but after having seen the scenes three times, I realized that it's Hayden's rather poor acting skills that's off. Don't get me wrong; I like him, and I think he's right for the part, but those lines could've been read with a LOT more credibility than that. He's sounds like he's late for date or something. Last there's the little things like why the spacecruisers and fighters all of a sudden sounds like propeller-driven aeroplanes ???  NOT good !  Still... I'm a hardcore starwars fan...

456,6.0,"I'm still deciding whether Attack of the Clones is the best Star Wars movie or the second best.  All sentimentality aside, this movie literally took my breath away, something A New Hope never did.  Before last night my favourite SW film was The Empire Strikes Back, then ANH, Return of the Jedi and finally, Episode I.  Episode II fits either at the start or just after Empire.  I read a few reviews before seeing the film and noted that critics tend to expect any film to be perfect in every way.  Comments like ""terrible scripting"" and ""bad acting"" seem to be thrown around often but I'm sure if ANH was released today it would get just as bad reviews, maybe worse.  In one line Attack of the Clones is as good as The Phantom Menace was bad. The special effects were freaky good and only one or two CG shots (out of hundreds) looked a tad fake.  The rest is worthy of an Academy Award (although it may be forgotten by then).  The sound was equally amazing from the seat rocking explosions to the bustling city of Coruscant to the quite waters of Naboo.  I was especially impressed with the re-introduction of some of the old favourites (read: lasers).  The score was fantastic and added so much to the film, plus picking up on the little themes from the original trilogy (Emperial March etc) weaved into the new score was a delight.  The final shot was almost identical to the final shot in Empire Strikes Back except this time we have Anakin and Padme standing arm in arm while C3PO and R2D2 look on.  Ahhhh, I just want to watch this film over and over again until Episode III comes out.",1

The entire storyline from 1-6 (no expanded universe crap) is simply incredible, from Anakin's discovery & training, to his turning & tierney, to finally his fall & redemption. But back to Episode 2. I thought the dialogue was well written. You want to compare it to something? Bust this. Th dialogue in this movie is better than the dialogue of any black comedy or Chris Rock movie where all they do is go like ""Damn nigga that crackas got mo money den me, he be oppressin me"" Oh yeah GREAT dialogue there.

462,6.0,"Saying that this movie is an improvement over the Phantom Menace really isn't saying anything since this movie is still awful! I still hate it but it is a little bit better. This movie actually had a lot more potential than most people give it credit for. A clone army battle, a Jedi protecting Padme from being assassinated, tracking down a bounty hunter who ends up being the father of Boba Fett (and it made a great story arc in Clone Wars!) This is some cool stuff! However, it's all destroyed by the one major thing this movie focuses on: The romance between Anakin and Padme. I was against this from the start because in the Phantom Menace, Padme was a queen. Yes, she was a young queen but she had to have been at least 14 or 15 to be elected. We also know that Anakin was around 8 or 9 in the last movie. That's at least 5 years apart! There's also the fact that I really don't like either of the characters. I really don't care for Padme. While she is strong in the final battle, Padme spends the rest of the movie either being creepily flirtatious or resisting Anakin. It kind of gets annoying after a while is all I'm saying. I would later feel bad for her in Revenge of the Sith after Anakin broke her heart but she's annoying here. Speaking of Anakin, when he's not Darth Vader, he is the most bratty, obnoxious, whiny baby in Star Wars history. Maybe even cinema history! With the exception of The Clone Wars (2008-2014) I hate Anakin in everything prequel related. Example: In this movie, Anakin's mother dies. Go figure! So what is his response? Schlaughter all the the Tusken Raiders of course! Okay, I get murdering the one/ones responsible for killing your mother but the women and children had nothing to do with her death! Also, get over yourself. You knew it wasn't going to be all sunshine and rainbows for her after you left Tatooine FOUR YEARS AGO! God! The romance here is also way too dumb and stupid to actually believe. Not to mention that the dialogue between them in just cringe-inducing and not even in a good way! I know this is a persistent problem throughout the movie but it mostly comes from the scenes with Anakin and Padme. Here's one of my favorite bad lines from this movie:",0

The movie became mythical with the Empire strikes back (1980) and the Return of the Jedi (1983). But then the myth was not resurrected with The Phantom Menace.

I think Natalie Portman is a great actress and the best choice for her character, nobody could have acted that role better, she did an amazing job, or am i being biased?

While it isn't as much of a mess as Episode 1 was, Episode 2 makes several missteps that are disappointing, but not offensive. The primary mistake is that Lucas got carried away with wanting more spectacle. He makes some beautiful shots. He knows how to frame things, how to make individual shots very memorable. And that's great, but the movie is packed with those, at the expense of making a movie that will stand up to repeated viewings without getting boring. The plot feels needlessly complex for a story that should be easy to summarize in a single paragraph. But each step of the story includes sequences that slather icing all over the cake that is Star Wars. Chasing Zam Wessel through Coruscant? Yes, it's technically impressive, but it feels pretty boring. It takes up too much time, cut with some very tacky dialogue, to get us to the nightclub. There are a lot of these little diversions, like the little chase through the asteroids, the entire droid factory sequence... event the romantic elements seem forced.",0

All that ""join me, old friend"" and ""the dark lord"" talk just seemed recorded and re-used. I almost saw his white robe and Gandalf right across the room. The upside is that at least Christopher Lee didn't have to learn new lines. What a shame, for such a good actor. I wonder what Lucas told him when he got the part? ""Hey Chris, look, I've got another villain role for you, don't bother preparing too much for it, just bring the LOTR script with you and cut out all references to the One Ring and Sauron and you've got the job!"" Even the arena scene just looked like Lee's figure has been cropped from The Two Towers and pasted there... I almost heard the words ""leave none alive!""... And then there's the arena scene. It was completely unrealistic. It was like the battle of Minas Tirith... I mean Annakin is fighting an robot-orc on top of a cross between an olyphant and the Balrog. Even the way the thing falls reminds me of the Olyphants...And the sounds it makes. Then, Obi-Wan fights something that looks like the praying mantis with a big aiming problem, and Padme is running away from a super-sized Garfield... But the character that failed completely in this movie was Yoda. Everywhere else he seems this calm little Buddhist with inverted phrases (which become intolerable in this episode), but now he's just this little rubber ball that jumps all over the walls...WHAT?

It's amazing to think that George Lucas ever got married, considering the romance in this film.

Yoda asks the toddlers for their opinion, and in a scene straight out of Teletubbies, they announce that the planet is being ""hidden"".  I mean, it's like going to a mechanic and asking him what's wrong with your car, and he announces prophetically, ""It's broke"".  ""Could you be a tad more specific?"" You ask.

Lucas continues to add more variety and uniqueness to landscapes, creatures, and machinery that boggles the imagination and keeps your eyes open on every frame.  The story is somewhat typical good guys/bad guys Star Wars, but there is an added twist of a romance occurring between young Anakin SkyWalker and the newly elected Senator Nabia of the Republic. Something else that actually is better than the original entries is the acting.  The cast does an excellent job and it is obvious that most of their careers will not be trapped in Star Wars(unlike some of the actors in the original).

511,1.0,"Good grief,Charlie Brown! Where do we begin? Let's get this straight from the beginning. I am a huge Star Wars fan. I have been one since the first one came out in 1977. I remember it well. I was 8 months pregnant. My husband was looking for a new job. It was his birthday. We could just about afford the matinée price for the two of us and for an a little less than two hours,we were entertained and trouble-free. It was a marvelous full-bodied movie. The second and third movies in the then trilogy proved to be just as entertaining. Who can forget Jabba the Hutt? Or the famous bar scene? So many imitators have paid homage in the past 30 years. Some fondly,some badly. THIS movie would have to fall in the very badly category. Note to whomever mucked up this( these) sequels: Special effects can no longer carry a movie . You still need a decent script,interesting characters,lines that make sense,and (now here's the big one) ACTORS WHO WEREN'T PICKED FOR LOOKS ALONE! I refer of course to Anikin and Padme. No spoiler from me as to what happens. I couldn't care less. Teenage angst and hormones - give me a break. Buffy the Vampire Slayer delivered it better each and every week in 45 minutes between Spike and Buffy and and Buffy and Angel. This is mindless crap.",0

517,1.0,"I was extremely excited about seeing Episode II, especially since Lucas promised a ""dark"" episode reminiscent of Empire.  Wow, I thought, we could really use a dark episode.  Since Jedi and Phantom Menace were clearly aimed more towards children (in my opinion) rather than the original Star Wars faithful, both had warm and fuzzy endings (and in some cases, characters too).  Well, ""dark"" wouldn't be an adjective that I would use to describe this movie at all.  How about ""hardly dingy"" instead?  I mean, the bad guys just weren't very bad.  I may be mistaken, but I only remember seeing Darth Sidius in costume one time.  If he did appear twice, he obviously didn't leave much of an impression on me, which only proves my point.  Now come on, EVERYONE remembers all of Darth Vader's and Darth Maul's scenes, right? To me, Darth Tyranus actually comes off as a decent guy for most of the movie.",0
518,5.0,"Attack of the clones is a very showy film, by that I mean it likes to show off its special effects and rather nicely done sets and blue screen. For example the first chase scene throughout the city planet after the would be assassin of Padme. It's a prime example of more background and stuff happening doesn't necessarily make the film better, just more clogged up and flashy.",0
519,4.0,"Attack of the Clones is a more boring version of The Phantom Menace with a considerably better ending. The movie revolves around Anakin's character, which is a real shame because he's one of the weakest points of the movie. He's a young padawan with considerable potential but is also an angsty hormonal teenager. We don't get any legitimate character traits during the movie, just obsession with Padme because she's pretty and a couple ham-fisted lines about how he's actually pretty into dictatorship. Subtle. There's no development or multi-dimensionality to his character, and his relationship with Padme couldn't be more dull or predictable. I honestly don't even know if Christensen gives a bad performance, because the cheesy and underwritten script he's given does seem to portray him as a dull angsty teenager, so if that was Lucas' vision, Christensen killed it. Portman as Padme, on the other hand, was a frustratingly flat performance where the script did give her more room for emotional variance and development. She's one of my favorite actresses of all time and her performance in Black Swan is still my favorite performance of all time, but after giving her a pass in The Phantom Menace because she's undercover, her flat line delivery and lack of physicality was a letdown. She doesn't sell the internal struggle of what to do with Anakin, doesn't really sell either the pretending to not like him or actually being in love at the end, and doesn't sell being a relevant senator. Love Portman, frustrated by her performance especially given how she could've elevated many of the dull parts of the movie.",0

523,4.0,"What is worse, Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones? This question has plagued my mind since finishing Episode 2. Both have redeeming qualities, but they are also highly flawed. The story in Attack of the Clones is more coherent than Episode 1, but the acting and dialogue are painful.",0
524,10.0,"It seems to be quite popular and ""trendy"" to label the Star Wars prequels as bad or inferior movies.Lets also think about today's movie-going public..people who enjoy such films as LOTR and Spider-Man.People say these films contain bad acting, that makes me want to laugh out loud.Nearly every performance in this wonderful film was either good or superb.And this film actually had ""gasp"" characters you could care about unlike overrated, second-rate fodder such as LOTR and its sequel.Lets not forget the brilliant score that embodied much emotion and feeling just like any great Star Wars film should.My hat is off to George Lucas and John Williams for nearly making me cry in one wonderful scene, just before Anakin and Padme are about to be sentenced to death in the arena.Scenes like that had way more power and emotion than any sub-par sequence in LOTR.The direction was also very good, as well as the FX.This film has all the magic that made you love Star Wars as a kid.The Yoda/Dooku fight was one of the most thrilling and jaw dropping scenes ever witnessed in a motion-picture.I do not pay attention to pathetic reviewers who simply can not understand or give credit to a film that truly deserves it.Anyone that would say The Phantom menace or Attack of The Clones has no plot must be the biggest brain-dead, Ben Affleck fan in the world.

527,2.0,"Easily the worst in the SW franchise. No real character development, for anyone, and all characters are one-dimensional and dull. Even the passion from Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid fails to come through on screen - largely due to a poor script. CGI was unnecessarily forced, and it holds up the least of all the films by today's standards. Anakin's romance didn't hold me, and the film was oversaturated with lightsabers everywhere. In the originals, (and sequels), lightsabers were treats for the audience. Here, the tradition was broken hardest, in having the sheer volume of them on-screen at once.<br /><br />The film also lacks any stand out moment, that all the other films have: Maul and pod racing from TPM; the transformation scene in ROTS; the trench run in ANH; Vader's reveal in ESB; the duel in ROTJ; Han's death in TFA; and Luke's death in TLJ. <br /><br />The only redeeming factor, is that it gave us some quality memes.",0
528,8.0,"Lucus is back to his best after the relative disaster of Episode 1.  The special effects are awesome, and the story lines are all coming together - meaning that Episode 3 should be the darkest of the six films.",1
529,8.0,"This movie was better than TPM, but still didn't quite make it to the level that most fans had expected. Again the story was great and the politics even more interwoven and subtle. George Lucas again shows he is a master at weaving a complex story while making it seem straight-forward. His directing even got a little better; still not great, but a lot better than before. The action was well done, though the lightsaber fighting wasn't quite as engrossing as in Episode I. A fight against CGI opponents doesn't look nearly as good as a fight against a live person, and most of the saber action was just that: the actor swinging at imagined enemies to be filled in later. Getting to see Yoda fight was a lot of fun, unfortunately too short. I did like the fact that after all of that twirling and spinning, he still pulled his cane to him to walk. It showed a great amount of discipline and respect for the Force that he only called on it when it was needed and didn't allow it to become a crutch (figuratively and literally). Yoda also looked far better in AotC than he did in TPM, one of the few times a CG character completely outdoes a ""real"" character (Yoda was a puppet in TPM). I was also hoping to see Anakin swinging two sabers for a bit longer (and Dooku picking up two as well, which is a scene they apparently cut from the film). I thought that Anakin was good, if a bit whiny; but then again, so was Luke in A New Hope Like father like son I guess. His speech about his love for Padme in the infamous ""Fireplace Scene"" while admittedly coming across as bad Goth Poetry did also seem rather chilling when you think about how intense his emotions are. The scene where he kills the Tusken Raiders then crying describes it later were very well done. It still suffers a bit from George's directing and not getting as good a performance as he could have from Hayden Christensen, but the moment for the character is wonderful in how it sets up the beginning of his fall to the Dark Side. The blossoming love between Anakin and Padme seemed a little rushed between ""Hey! I haven't seen you in 10 years!"" to ""Let's get married!"". And the ""I truly, deeply, love you."" line Padme gives Anakin as they are taken into the arena seemed really corny, but considering what it was supposed to portray I can be a bit forgiving. Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyranus played by long time actor Christopher Lee was also very convincing as a political minded aggressor; but as a Dark Lord he seemed a bit weak. Political manoeuvrings and the fact that he had the plans for the Death Star in his pocket aside, he didn't have much else. If he hadn't gone over to ""Darth"" status and had still been in the beginning of his fall to evil it would have been a lot more in sync with his place in the story. He saw the corruption of the Senate and the stagnation of the Jedi; he tried to do something about it but was manipulated by Palpatine into falling to the Dark Side, not having enough willpower to stand up to him. Dooku is a very tragic character in the Star Wars saga, a man who wants to make the galaxy a better place, but winds up helping along the start of one of it's darkest times. In a way he is foreshadowing Anakin who will one day do the same thing, albeit on a much grander scale. Jango Fett was a pleasant surprise. New Zealand born Temuera Morrison brought a smart, calculating and menacing presence to the screen. He made you believe that this was a warrior who didn't fear the Jedi, no matter how powerful they could be. When he stood up to Obi-Wan when they first met you could tell the only thing he was worried about was being found out by the Law, he wasn't afraid of the Jedi. He proved it later when he defeated Obi-Wan on the landing platform, even if it was a close fight. Though like his son Boba in Return of the Jedi, he went out in a very quick manner that wasn't nearly as satisfying as you might have wanted for such a cool character. Mace Windu, the purple lightsaber wielding Jedi played by Samuel Jackson is supposed to be the best sword fighter in the Jedi order, and second overall to Yoda himself. Unfortunately all we really get to see him do is fight CG opponents, which doesn't do much to show his prowess. The only other things I found disappointing was the use of the reverberating sound effect. It was really overused, the ships made it, the speeders made it, even the animals made it. It was used so often that I lost my suspension of disbelief every time I heard it. C-3PO's constant barrage of puns didn't endear me to him much either. Lastly the ""do everything button"" that Amidala uses in the ship when they are about to leave Tatooine. It's a break in believable continuity as they zoom in showing her press it twice for two totally different functions; but it's not that big of a deal; just an annoyance. Overall though the movie was entertaining, a couple of great chase scenes and a great weaving plot that really progressed the characters and Palpatine's bid to rule the galaxy. It also seemed to redeem Lucas a bit in terms of Jar-Jar. When he falls for an amazingly transparent manipulation and calls the vote that will give full executive power to the Supreme Chancellor, he single-handedly puts the reigns of the government into Palpatine's hands. In other words we now have a story based reason to hate him. It's all Jar-Jar's fault. ;) 4 out of 5 stars.",1

Ewan McGregor was an outstanding actor for Obi-Wan. He is one of my favorite actors. Hayden Christensen, while he had just a few exaggerated lines, was awesome as the troubled teenage Anakin that soon becomes the legendary Darth Vader. Natalie Portman was simply great for Padme' Amidala. This movie reminded me of Spider-Man in that it was able to create a great love story combined with visually intense fight scenes. My favorite scenes are when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan fight, when Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme' are in the arena fighting the monsters, the part when Jango Fett and Obi-Wan are trying to kill each other in the asteroid belt, Yoda's fight with Darth Tyranus, and the climax. A great movie. I can't wait to see Episode 3. This Episode, we'll probably get a glimpse at young Luke Skywalker and Leia. Anakin turning into the evil Darth Vader, and the real Clone Wars.

The love story bits were something else.  If Annette Funicello had a cameo during the sappy love story bits I wouldn't have been surprised.   Hayden Christensen was a petulant, immature, ill-mannered little boy.  He had no appeal or believability as a Jedi.  I can't see how he would have lasted through any kind of rigorous training.  Natalie Portman was more appealing and though she was believable as a Queen she seemed too young to be a senator.  She was good in the movie, attractive and appealing. Hayden Christensen seemed much more appealing in the DVD extra features than he did in the movie.  Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid were all good.  Dialog was typically clunky.  Someone should slowly ease George Lucas away from the typewriter after the general outline of the movie is finished and allow someone with some experience with real people and dialog polish the final version.  The movies succeed in spite of the characterizations not because of them.  It is the effects and the action that appeal.

548,10.0,"I saw this movie twice when it was first released. I really thought I would have seen it more times already. I enjoyed my overall experience. Criticisms include; 1. Their should have been more obvious signs of flirting and courtship between Anakin and Padme i.e the scene were Anakin and Padme are discussing what Jedi are allowed to do and she asks him 'Are you allowed to love?' and less scenes of her refusing his advances, 2. Lucas not being camera shy towards Anakin's anger - this is suppose to be a darker trilogy, 3. Darth Sidious/Senator Palpatine should be made more obvious to the audience, because he isn't so obvious this movie doesn't stand so well alone as an independent movie, 4. for me personally I would have liked Anakin's hand in the end to have been completely covered by a black glove that would have been sweet I think. Despite these criticisms I still enjoyed this movie and I want to see it again before it leaves theaters this summer. As it stands I actually feel very sorry for Anakin and Padme. Anakin because he inherently is good but I know who and what is to become of him and for Padme because she is an innocent who tries to do the right thing and I believe she will pay a hefty price for it. The way George has set this thing up so far it seems like there can be little to nothing uplifting for Episode III.",1

Will give credit though, Ewan McGregor was fantastic as a now established Jedi Knight in comparison to his brash character of the previous film. The story fits nicely with the way the Clone Wars begun and fitted into the already heard of history spoken of in the sequels. Ian McDiarmid was brilliant as the plotting Chancelor Palpatine, but a little more insight into his interference with Anakin's Jedi training would have made both characters so much more interesting. The droid war and the creation of a very stormtrooper look alike clone army to fight these droids was well done and set this up for a brilliant climax.

The writing, and dialogue are far better - personally that was my biggest concern with PHANTOM... Also, there is less Jar Jar Binks, so audiences will be less anoyed by the childish antics of that very disliked Gungan. But the best part of EPII was clearly Yoda. Yoda has the largest role his character has ever had in a STAR WARS film, and although he has become a CGI character from a puppet, the people at ILM did a marvelous job in crafting him. The scene where Yoda has his own lightsaber battle with Count Dooku is pretty impressive, as well. For IMDB, I'd rate this film at 10 stars. If it were the normal film rating system, however, I would give it 4 stars; both equalling excellence. On another note, I did love PHANTOM MENACE.

568,7.0,"I walked into this movie expecting at best a couple hours of air-conditioned comfort, at worst another painfully dull experience as Phantom Menace turned out to be. Surprisingly, I was quite entertained. Much in this film harkened back to 'The Empire Strikes Back', in that it has texture, and even some dimension--along with incredibly improved visuals. The reviews are spot on in this regard; the movie is stunningly beautiful and feels 'real', unlike the video-game feel of 'Menace'. I'll say right now that the love story aspect was stillborn; in fact, nearly every scene featuring Padme and/or Anakin was as flat as a day-old beer. The digital performers out-acted them on every level (Jar-Jar aside--even his brief appearances were too much). Despite the overall clunkiness of the story, I felt something I thought wasn't possible with a Star Wars movie any more: involvement. (SPOILER: I especially enjoyed the return to Tatooine and the moisture farm, seeing Luke's future guardians as youths, in the familiar settings from the first movie. END SPOILER) While most of the dialogue was expectedly painful, there were a few chuckles, and C-3P0 has the best scenes he's ever had. The obligatory 'big battle' at the end was everything that the battle at the end of 'Menace' was not. I'm glad I gave in and saw this on the big screen. It's not a great movie, but it has many fine moments and bodes well for the next installment--as long as George has his romance jones licked, that is.",1

The follow up to the 1999 blockbuster seems to top its predecessor in all it was for. When George Lucas to set out to make a fabulous movie he did just that. The story centers around a young adult named Anakin Skywalker ten years later and when he and his master Obi Wan Kenobi are sent to protect Senator Amidala is put threw something horrible that Anakin starts to rekindle an old feeling. Now in more danger than ever they are on a hideout that will forbid them to there destiny which will result to the actions in the original trilogy. Now the young apprentice and a smashing Senator are falling in love in secret while a dark sith Dooku is not far from them. The film is very awesome and is worth your time.",1

I suppose the only reason I didn't give this movie the same as that is because the issue of nostalgia wasn't as big an ingredient in this movie. The last one was wonderful in part because it was the first episode of the SW series in 15 years. Having grown up with the other 3, I was eager to say the least.",1
573,1.0,I'll try to be brief.  As an avid Star Wars fan for years I've always been gun-ho to soak up more and more of possibly the biggest franchise to date.

574,6.0,"Like I said when I did the review of season 1, SW is my childhood and I love every SW movie. However, it is difficult to admit that this is a perfect part. Things started off very promising, I enjoyed the humorous dialogues between the characters, besides the perfect makeup, hair and costumes, the characters in this part are all interesting in their own way. However the storytelling of this part seems to be problematic, every segment is easily cut in the middle, which makes it like we don't understand what the characters are feeling, and the part where Padme confesses her feelings to Anakin because she thought she was going to die, then she quickly untied herself and escaped, isn't this too ridiculous? The character Anakin, who would later become Darth Vader, behaves quite strangely, like a spoiled brat with school problems, a far from Anakin in part 1. And the lightsaber battle as well, not so special, if I don't want to say, boring. Anyway, I'm also impressed with the setting in the movie, the production design, wow I just wanted to say that.",1

In much the same way as the events of Episode II progressed, the events of Episode I progressed nicely so that the visual climax of the film, the ""Duel of the Fates"", showed us the best lightsaber duel in the history of Star Wars. (Like I said, the progression of events in Episodes I and II are similar, but a lot more happens in Episode II, if for no better reason than that Anakin Skywalker, who is still the focus of the film, is now a lightsaber-wielding Jedi.)",1

I understand that some of the script is terrible, and the storyline may be a bit difficult to understand, but didn't the original Star Wars Movies all have the same problems. The Only really convincing Star Wars ever created was The Empire Strikes Back, and George Lucas didn't even direct that one! Still, Attack of the Clones had its good points, the directing was fine, the acting was usually good, and the Lightsaber fight with Yoda was once in a lifetime viewing. So, Just because it didn't quite live up to the original Star Wars movies, doesn't mean it wasn't good. When I first saw Attack of the Clones, I thought it was much better than the phantom menace. Some may say I am wrong, but I always class a film by its ability to excite, convince and influence the viewer. Which it did, to me and those who saw it with me.",0
583,4.0,"Attack of the Clones is an appropriate title for this exsanguinated rehashing of The Empire Strikes Back.  The acting is positively wooden, with the solitary decent performance being turned in by Christopher Lee as Dooku. Any film in which Samuel Jackson comes across with the cinematic texture of oatmeal needs some better writing behind it; what a waste of talent! Annikin Skywalker is played as a whiny little brat who deserves a good spanking, and suddenly Obi Wan has become a tremendous bumbler.  Yoda, who spends his time walking with a cane, is suddenly capable of aerial backflips.  A hackneyed attempt at comic relief is provided by the C3PO/R2D2 droid combo, but there's no reason for them to be in the movie.  Its an obvious device and it doesn't work.",0

Then I decided to watch the old trilogy that was really the old bang that we all know! I started to get familiar the overall story and I also realized that I found it really interesting.

All of the images in the Star Wars films feel like I have seen them somewhere before-and I probably have-that notwithstanding-I think the films are too much about war-it is really not that interesting-like the boundaries of space have been completely explored and there is nothing left to learn or do except have giant wars-that is a dismal vision of the future to me-the concept of alien civilizations is dealt with in a basic way that tells nothing about what makes them different to humans or why they spend any time at all in human space-none of the aliens who do look like they have anything in common with humans anyway-I think that should have been explored in my opinion. So maybe it is nothing but cheap rip off SF-made to look clean and cool with advanced CGI effects and nothing really going on in the way of IQ activity. Oh well, the kiddies will like it.

I have had the opportunity to see the film once in each format.  there is just no comparison, the digital film is astoundingly better quality than is the regular film.

What really kills the film, so much like the previous instalment, is the acting and dialogue. The story itself is once again completely adequate, but the execution of this is all over the place. The pairing of Anakin and Padmé could've been the most intriguing part of the film but it ends up just coming across as cringeworthy. The horrors Anakin is forced to bear with regard to his mother should've made for the best scenes of the entire film, but instead, just comes across as weightless and poorly performed. I have nothing against Hayden Christensen as an actor or a person, but I really don't feel he was right for the role. He tries very hard in all of his scenes but it ends up looking a bit over the top and cringeworthy. I don't blame him entirely however as George Lucas has shown with the Prequels and even parts of the Originals, that he simply isn't a gifted writer when it comes to dialogue.

604,4.0,"Yes, when the highlight of the film is an aged Christopher Lee battling a little green dude who really is not there the movie is just not a winner. Wisely, Lucas pulled back the usage of Jar Jar and replaced the young Anakin Skywalker with another actor. However, the movie is not much better than the last film and has way to many groan inducing scenes involving Anakin and Amidale who is now a senator as the planet she is from obviously has serious flaws in the way its government is structured. This one starts out with an assassination attempt on Amidale and great scenes like those Lucas ripped right out of the film ""The Fifth Element"" and had people selling death sticks (oh, what a clever jab at the tobacco trade). This film offers nothing new in the way of establishing a decent plot, other than the brief mention of the clone wars from the original Star Wars film. The guy they got to play Anakin was rather bad at his lines and was even stiffer than Ewan though I really think Ewan's main problem is that he did not want to really be in these films. We also get the origins of Bubba Fett as a guy who had less than ten minutes screen time in the original trilogy really needed a whole section of the movie dedicated to how he came about. Really this should show movie makers do not make scenes based on the fans wishes. Sure for some reason Bubba had his fans, but in the end his character was not important enough to merit this much attention. The only thing more stupid was making C-3PO a creation of Anakin even though he was a widely recognized protocol droid in the original series and adding Chewbacca for the heck of it in the final film in this rather badly written trilogy. There are scenes here and there that are good though (though not any scene where Anakin and Amidale are acting cutesy). Then Christopher Lee comes in and acts rings around everyone else and has the most entertaining fight in the movie as he takes on Yoda. So in the end, a rather sad attempt at trying to write a story around characters that were never really important to begin with and trying to set up a bit of Anakin's switch to the dark side.",0

608,4.0,"I think that based on story, excitement and character development, this is one ranks the bottom out of all 6 of the Star Wars films. While the special effects and action were good, the character development wasn't there, and the story was rather boring. Here, Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) is now a Senator representing her home planet of Naboo in the Galatic Republic. A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), wants to assassinate her. In the mist, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewen McGregor) continues to train Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianson) to become a Jedi, but it is apparent that he would probably break the Jedi Code due to his growing love interest with Amidala. What results is poor screen comprehension between Skywalker and Amidala, and this film was drags on for too long to be focusing on the love interest between the two. This film also lacks the charm and excitement that the other films have. A few actions scenes were quite good, especially the one between Yoda and Count Dooku. The sceneries were also beautiful, especially the scenes of the Naboo palace - gorgeous landscape and cinematography. ",0

Fans (and I am one of them) come to see the films in this series mainly for the fairy sci-fi tale atmosphere, for the infinite cast of space creatures, for the laser weapons fights and for the space or flying speed races. Acting is mediocre, dialogues succeed to provide the usual quantity of 'Star Wars' quotes without being at all natural, and even some of the effects are not that impressive - but what is impressive, now that we have seen 'Lord of the Rings'. However, the Force is still alive in this film, and this episode has stylistic consistency with the rest. Go with the right mind set, and you will enjoy it. 8/10 on my personal scale.",1

Obi-wan especially (""I swear that boy'll be the death of me...""- oh god...), with Anakin's painfully bad 'romance' coming a close second. However, three key factors saved this: First, towards the second half, C-3PO and R2D2 make a return, some of the only real-ish characters from the first 3 films, to anchor this film back to the ground after so many of these goddam Jedi with their vaguely mystical and deeply tedious dialogue. Second, it's around this time when the story proper kicks in, which is well written, and lighter on dialogue. Third, you see sides of Anakin that HAVE been well written, such as how he comes to lust after such power. It's a great film from here on in basically, and doesn't slack off coming to the end.",0

Jar Jar Binks is still around to put everyone in a bad mood. This movie has more action than the previous one, but it feels mindless and unexciting. Obi-Wan gets more characterization, but only a little bit. Anakin's only character traits are being disrespectful or being angry at everything. Padme apparently hasn't aged at all since the last movie which makes it okay for Anakin to be a creepy and horny to her. The writing is awful (I wish that I could just wish away my feelings).

Sadly, Star Wars has sank to the level at which many people are almost ashamed to like the new films anymore, an unfortunate fact which has come about solely as a result of Episode I, and the failure of Episode I is due in no small part to the abysmally moronic addition of a character like Jar Jar Binks, who is easily one of the most popularly hated characters ever put on screen.

I don't know, but Christensen didn't seem to play the part of an emotionally torn Jedi apprentice destined to become one of the great Movie Villains of all time.  He more played the part of an arrogant, whiney brat.  At this stage in the story, Skywalker should have been struggling to keep his aggressiveness in check, occasionally lashing out (as he did once in the film under extreme provocation) possibly even almost letting his anger overpower him, but reigning it in just in time. Otherwise, the movie was excellent.  The battle sequences are as good as I have seen in a Sci-Fi movie, and the lead-in to Episode III is very good. Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGreggor give excellent performances, as does the actor who plays Jango Fett. All in all, the movie is on a par with the original trilogy.

Anakin is learning the ways of the Jedi from Obi-Wan and falls in love with Padme, and a sith named Count Dooku creates a separatist army to fight the Republic. Hayden Christensen steps into the role of Anakin Skywalker, and while he isn't the most experienced actor, i thought he did a good job of showing Anakin's innocence and his brushes with dark side. Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice to play a younger Obi-Wan, and he continues to prove it here, with just the right amount of smart-ass lines. The action scenes are pretty damn cool, too. Jango Fett's duel with Obi-wan on the ocean world is one of the cooler scenes, and the huge battle between the clones and the droids near the end is jaw-dropping.

In terms of action and story, I'd say it was an improvement over TPM. So that's a good thing. The lightsaber duel at the end was pretty cool. Though the one in TPM is still the best (until I see the ones in ROTS of course). Overall, I think it moved the story forward in a decent way. I don't really see Anakin as a pain as most people did. He is a teenager and pretty whiney so that's to be expected. I didn't like his choice of 'lines' to Padme though. I would be pretty afraid to use those lines on a chick :). It reminds me of what Carrie Fisher said in an interview about Lucas' writing: 'You can write/type this stuff out on paper, you just can't say it'. That's basically my feeling about it. Still, I give it a high rating because, as painful as those scenes were.....seeing the action and Jango/Obi Wan scenes (and the arena battle) made up for it all.",1

Whilst some of Lucas' ideas are a bit off, he and his production team nevertheless know how to make a film, and regrettably until someone passes that knowledge to the fans, you will always have this kind of discrepancy between expectation and fulfilment.

When Star Wars came out, it was the first of its kind.  No one had ever imagined something like that.

Obi-Wan discovers that Sidious and his apprentice, Count Dooku (Lee) are secretly making clones of troopers. Anakin and Padme also share a romance and end up marrying each other.

I am aware that Lucas had much more money to spend and his company had advanced the CGI thing much further than was available in 1970's. Part of the charm of the original film was that everything looked used and battered- almost nothing in the earlier films looked that way. Hayden , simply, was not up to the job and had zero chemistry with Natalie, though we were told that was the reason for casting them. Ewan McGregor whom I rate as an actor was limited by his need to channel Sir Alec. I have watched these prequels 3 times and find my mind wandering which never happened with the original films. Mind you none of those first three had Jar Jar Binks - a mistake of gargantuan dimensions which seemed impossible for a filmmaker of Lucas' experience to make. Many of the characters had voices where it was difficult to catch what they were saying (Watto and Binks come to mind).

And why haven't these brilliant Jedi Knights ever figured out that if they just put wrist-straps on their light sabers they won't drop them just out of reach every 15 seconds?

Also, like Empire (unfortunately) no lead really shines as Alec and Liam did in other entries; Portman is very attractive but isn't quite charismatic enough to drive the story. The romantic angle is almost wooden, but that's to be expected, almost welcomed, where the emphasis is really somewhere else.

His epic saga is the ultimate tale of Good against Evil-- pure in every sense--  and with the fifth installment, `Star Wars:  Episode II, Attack of the Clones,' Lucas carefully inserts more of the integral pieces into that puzzle, leading us ever closer to the full and complete picture that will be revealed in Episode III, the sixth and final chapter that will at last bring the story full circle.",1

Remember the suspenseful incredulity you felt while watching the most incredible spectacle you have ever seen on the big screen.  Remember the music, the sounds, the romance, the adventure, the bloody passion. It IS back.  As I watch this film for the second time (now on video), I realize that all of my criticism was due to nothing more than pathetic peer-like (decipher) expectations and 'grown-up-ism.'  This is the original series. You must watch this film with an un-altered eye.  You must watch this film with an open heart.  This is pure cinema.  Watch Anakin embrace his mother the same way in which Luke will embrace him years later.  Watch Anakin's reflection on Tatooine...notice something familiar?  Listen to the INCREDIBLE music written for the film (Williams must forever be remembered as a great composer).  EXPERIENCE the clone wars.  If you dare pretend that these are any less powerful than the battle on Endor, then I dare you to view Jedi again and compare it to the intense zoom-ins and dust clouds of these war scenes.  I must end this geekish tirade now as it is probably alienating all potential viewers of this film.  Just enjoy.",1

You can tell things are getting closer to the events in ""Star Wars"" as Boba Fett appears, the first designs of the storm trooper armor, the introduction of already familiar characters and other details. Other things made this movie for me such as sexy Natale Portman suddenly going ""Britney"" and totally digital Yoda going bad-a** with a light saber on Count Dracula himself, Christopher Lee. Why couldn't we see a scene like this in the old Hammer films. Lee as you recall was first choice to play Darth Vader, but he turned it down. His awaited appearance in the series has become a milestone. There is also an anti-smoking message in this movie that millions of people ought to notice. The movie is still full of spectacular effects and insights to this universe that will drive the fans wild. I give this movie a ten for making me feel like a kid again !",1
668,6.0,"Star wars episode 2 attack of the clones is not horrible. While I'll say that the dialogue is terrible and the love story is worthless, Other than that the story is pretty solid. The worst element of The Phantom Menace was the characters. I am happy to say they are much better in this. (Even though that's like saying a slingshot is more complicated than a rock). The character's in this movie can generate at least a bit of empathy. The acting in this movie is often criticized. I don't think this is fair. You have to remember that the dialogue is robotic and unrealistic that I doubt Malcolm McDowell could have pulled off Anakin, and George Lucas was directing these actors. Samuel .l was miscast and the rest of the actors had no real reason to be cast as their characters. The story in this is somewhat compelling and sometimes even interesting, which is a lot in the Star Wars Prequels. It revolves around Anakin having to protect Padme and Obi-wan having to find the person who ordered her assassination. The beginning is solid, the middle isn't horrible and the end is kind of exciting. The worst element of the movie is it's love story. There's been so much said about this I don't need to add anything, but I concur with those who say it is pointless, doesn't make sense, cliché and dumb. The special effects (which I estimate twenty times the amount of time was spent on than the script) are pretty great. It doesn't really look that real, but it does open a lot of possibilities, like the arena scene and the droid-clone battle. This about wraps it up. It's not The Godfather, but it's a nice, decent Star Wars movie. And Jake Lloyd is gone. Thank Christ.",0

670,6.0,"Five movies in, and I think I've finally come to my definitive least favorite of the series. It's not bad, per say, just underwhelming, although it does have an better plot than The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, the Galactic Republic is on the brink of civil war when several planetary system threaten to secede under the leadership of rogue Jedi Count Dooku. An assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, so Anakin Skywalker is tasked with protecting her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to investigate. Luckily, Episode II did deliver on my hope from Episode I in that the plot moves considerably forward, and some of the more notable characters are given more screen time (or less in Jar Jar's case, thank god). Padme and Anakin have a romantic subplot that I didn't mind, and Obi-Wan is always fun to watch, but I thought Anakin's character was much more interesting in this movie. There was quite a bit of foreshadowing of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader that put the prequels into a better context and made Anakin more intriguing. It'd be nice if Hayden Christensen wasn't so awful in his role. Attack of the Clones does succumb to middle-chapter problems at times. There wasn't anything as memorable as the Darth Maul battle in The Phantom Menace or the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi. The fight between Yoda and Count Dooku is pretty cool at first, but watching a little green alien jump around like Sonic got old after a while. Attack of the Clones is still just as entertaining and fun as the other Star Wars movies, even if it's one of the weaker entries.",1
671,6.0,"Alas, it had to happen. Lucas made a Star Wars film that, to my mind, was almost boring. The films execution is OK...pretty much average for a film made in 2002, so it's not state-of-the-art. First time THAT'S happened. The acting in this film is actually pretty lame. NO ONE stands out in this film. All the others had some great acting but not this one. Yoda didn't SOUND like Yoda. Sure they used the same guy to do the voice, but he didn't sound the same. Still, the film has bright spots in it and it serves to pique the interest in the next one. I just hope it's a little better than this one was. I probably won't buy this one. I may rent it again sometime. And what the heck is an idiotic character like Jar Jar doing in it - it's presence only serves to take away from any seriousness the film might have had.",0

Anakin's duel with Dooku should've been better in content & directing. But again, there's few movies I'd rather watch than SW because of the good stuff. Even though I still question the wisdom of killing off Maul in TPM, I love Dooku. He's the ultimate precise, smug second fiddle. And can you get a better henchman than Jango Fett? I loved the mystery surrounding him & Kamino as well as Geonosis. I get chills every time I watch the first appearance of the future Stormtroopers.

The most disappointing thing for me in this film is that there isn't really a story , someone is trying to asassinate padme and we eventually find out who but i feel like episode 2 should've just been the clone wars really and getting to know their characters more because they're a lot different to the stormtroopers eventhough they look similiar.

The romance between Anakin and Padme may be something other than what the dyed-in-the-wool sci-fi devotees were looking for in the ""Star Wars"" saga.

I think in general that people take these films too seriously and want to make them the way they would like or have it done.I hear a lot of comparisons to the 1st trilogy{episodes4,5,6} and how much better the 1st trilogy is to these new films. Yes the Jedi are more amped to do more unbelievable stuff they could have been grounded a little bit more.You have to understand once the director has us he can take us anywhere do anything. Some say JarJar is too much and gets on their nerves and other things that annoys them about the new trilogy. You can say the same of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI.I don't enjoy the original trilogy any more or less than the new trilogy. I think they are both satisfying. I seen the original Star Wars A New Hope in 1977 when I was 12 and it is my personal favorite film. No movie will do that for me as far as a movie-going experience again. I think it has to do with being young and something making an impression on you that is lasting. Now that i am older movies don't do that same thing for me even though I would like them to. It happens once in a lifetime. George Lucas has said that he wrote all the Star Wars movies and the Indiana Jones films in the style and vein of the thirties and forties movie serials. He wrote and gave us a big part of himself and made some really great movies. George did have Lawrence Kasdens writing help on EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI that may have given those films some thing that may now missing from the writing in the newer films.

682,7.0,"For the first two thirds of Attack of the Clones, the film ranges from total mediocrity to passable entertainment to horrific boredom. The dialogue is rather awful, the plot developed in a hackneyed manner. A couple of the early action sequences are fun, especially the one involving Jango Fett, whose young clone is named Boba (Boba Fett fans will be given their money's worth in this one!). The love story with Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is truly execrable. I wouldn't dismiss Hayden Christensen as many have already (Portman is actually the film's weakest link). Just by chance, I saw about 2/3 of Life As a House the night before I saw Star Wars, in which Christensen stars as a troubled teen, much as he does in Attack of the Clones. He's not a bad actor, really. I would more blame the inadequacy of the character on the writing. Lucas has no clue how to develop emotions on screen, at least in this character, without shoving it into the dialogue. The only success that Lucas has in the character is in an homage to The Searchers, where Annie (they really need to stop calling him this; he'll turn into Darth Vader just because everyone keeps insulting his manhood!) goes off into the deserts of Tatooine to rescue his mother from a group of Sand People.

691,4.0,"Yes even Phantom Menace. At least Phantom Menace can be kind of fun to watch mostly because it sticks to the tried and true Star Wars formula (even though it does it badly). The acting in Phantom is bad, because they put all their money on a poor little kid who couldn't act, surrounded him with actors who seemed to have never worked with green screens before and CGI that hasn't aged well.

693,5.0,"Anakin Skywalker has become a teenager, torn between obeying his master Obi-Wan Kenobi or going all out to show how great he thinks he is. The movie has three purposes. To begin the relationship between Anakin and Padme, to introduce the Clone War, and to show off flashy special effects...That's about it.",1
694,6.0,"Three years ago, I remember the feeling I had while I was waiting to see Star Wars: Episode I. I had hopes of it being as great as the original three movies had been. However, Episode I was a great disappointment. Just today, I stood in line to see Episode II with a very doubtful and cynical disposition. I was expecting that it would be not much better than Episode I. I was very wrong. It is only one of two movies in which the entire audience clapped afterwards, the other movie being Lord of the Rings. This movie is what Star Wars is all about. Episode II: Attack of the Clones has all of the action that The Phantom Menace should have had. The quality of the special effects exceeds that of Episode I by leaps and bounds. The backgrounds are stunning! Without spoiling anything, I will say that this installment has THE best battle scenes of ANY Star Wars movie. The fights are fast-paced and exciting. Although it is quite humorous to see Yoda fight, that scene is simply incredible. If you have any doubts, as I did, about this movie get over it and GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Not one Star Wars or Science Fiction fan should go without seeing this movie in the theater.",1

All the others (bar ep 1, which I ain't even getting into) have a story in their own right, but add to the whole individually -  the FX were too plastic, the characters went 'bendy' in wide shot action scenes (Jango and Obi-Wan fight, for instance), and all the characters lacked emotion.  Anyone remember the emotion Luke Skywalker showed at the end of Empire Strikes Back?  How about vs Vader in Return of the Jedi?  Is that so long ago, in a movie so far far away?  The fight scenes back then didn't need thousands and thousands of items on the screen all at once.  We had a hero, and the action followed his attempts at thwarting the bad guys..  the near misses on his life, his successes - you were right there with him.  This time, the action breaks from one character to the next, and none were hero worthy..",0

Star Wars was and is a epic masterpiece, due mainly to high story telling and his direction.  Both of these aspects are gone in this flick.  Don't get me wrong the special effects are mind boggling, but the pacing and plot had me constantly looking at my watch and wondering if this movie was ever going to end.",0
707,5.0,"Continuing the prequels to the original trilogy, from Razzie nominated director George Lucas, Anakin Skylwalker (Razzie winning Hayden Christensen) has grown up, and is now learning apprentice to Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). In this film, the Queen has quit, and is now Senator Padmé Amidala (Razzie nominated Natalie Portman), and is endangered by bounty hunter, later identified as Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), and it is Anakin's job to keep an eye on her. Along the way though, he breaks a Jedi rule by falling in love. Meanwhile, Obi-Won searches for the bounty hunter, and finds a planet where cloning of troops is taking place, apparently for the Rebels. Anakin feels very strongly about his mother, Shmi Skywalker-Lars (Pernilla August), so he takes Padmé with him to his home planet to find her, and he manages to find her, in dying moments, so he kills the desert people that kidnapped her (a step towards the Dark Side). Obi-Won is also on the planet, and he meets former Jedi, turned to Dark Side, Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus (Christopher Lee), and the battle soon after gets under way, as the clones (on the good side) attack the villains. In the end, the war is over for now, Anakin gets a replacement hand (that he lost), and he and Padmé marry. Also starring Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (now computer generated), Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple for Christensen and Portman and Worst Remake or Sequel. Sir Christopher Lee was number 31, Samuel L. Jackson number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lee was number 13, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 65 on The Ultimate Film.

Personally I still salute it, and what it has done for children's imagination. I was eleven when I saw Attack of the Clones, and even at that age I was smart enough to know what was wrong with this film. Arguably the worst Star Wars feature, Episode 2 is cheezy, badly written, and kinda boring. The action scenes are too short, the romance between Anakyn and Padme, is utterly wooden, and the attempts at humour are pretty feeble.",0
709,10.0,"After watching the Phantom Menace, I thought Star Wars couldn't possibly get better. And yet, somehow it did. Hayden Christensen delivers gripping dialogue, superbly written. This film is a romance story above all else, and it absolutely NAILS IT. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so real, and so pristinely written, I wondered how anyone believed the romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy at all. Ignore the haters, clearly their IQ is too low to understand this cinematic marvel. Would rate higher if I could, perhaps the best film ever made.",0

Anakin has always admired Obi-Wan, but his heart is edging to the Dark Side while professing his love for the now Senator Padme Amidala(Natalie Portman). We are introduced to a more than apt villain Count Dooku(Christopher Lee)and Jango and Boba Fett; and as well Senator Bail Organa(Jimmy Smitts).",1
711,3.0,"Being a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, when I first saw The Phantom Menace, I was disappointed, like most Star Wars fans were. Then Episode II came out and I read about it and started hearing how it's so much better than The Phantom Menace, and how Star Wars has been saved. Puh-leez! Episode II is by far the worst Star Wars movie to date. It just disgusts me. It's missing all the mysticism and the comedy, excitement, action, magic of the original trilogy, not to mention it's ten times more boring than Episode I. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It just drags on and on and on. It's a shame that a talented guy like George Lucas makes such crappy movies this days. He's let all these special effects capabilities he has go to his head. Episode II is all special effects and that's enough to ruin the movie right there. The original trilogy did not rely too heavily on special effects and it didn't need to because it had such a great story. The script for Episode II is a joke. George Lucas needs to start letting other people write the Star Wars scripts. The love story is so cheesy and completely lacking in the romance. The romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy was well acted and well written. But the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie sounds like something out of a crappy Hallmark card. But I guess Lucas tries to make up for the crappy script by overloading the movie with special effects which just makes it seem superficial. The last 45 minutes of the movie that were supposed to be so dazzling and exciting were about as fun as watching paint try. And that Yoda fight that everyone was talking about it? It's ridiculous. Seeing a little digital Yoda running around doing flips and stuff made me laugh. In conclusion this movie sucks. bye.",0
712,6.0,"This was George Lucas's attempt to appease the fans for what he did in Episode I. Despite the film being better, it still felt a little flat. The story deepened a bit and Ewan McGregor still turned in a very strong performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker seemed very ""emo"" and whiny. Maybe this was the director and the script's fault, but Christensen turned many (including myself) off to this character. Best part of the film is the Count Dooku lightsaber duel at the end of the film. Many did NOT see it coming and it was pretty enjoyable.",1

715,7.0,"""The Phantom Menace"" was, without a doubt, the worst Star Wars movie, but it still wasn't bad. ""Attack of the Clones"" is MUCH better. Let's list the reasons, shall we? 1- It has MUCH more action, partly because it has the beginning of the Clone Wars. 2- The romance angle, although not as good as Han & Leia's, does what it is meant to do. 3- Obi-Wan goes on a detective spree! Yay! Go Obi-Wan! 4- Not to much Jar Jar Binky! Yes! 5- The visuals! Go visuals! But there are a few flaws. 1- One of the things that made Han & Leia's romance interesting was that it had not much kissy kissy goo goo stuff in it. But Anakin & Padme's does. 2- In this movie, Anakin, like Luke, gets his arm chopped off. When it is cut off, he shows no sign of pain other than a barely audible ""ugh"". 3- Another problem with the romance angle. Anakin is 19. Padme is 24. I'll leave you to figure out what's gross and disgusting about that. 4- Even though he's better than Jake Lloyd (Jake played Anakin in Episode 1, and seemed to be bored in his role. In fact, when I watch him, it makes Jabba the Hutt look like Ob-Wan), Hayden Christensen is awful and thus, he is Gayden Christensen among fans. Overall, I good Star Wars movie I recommend, but still not like the Originals. Watch it if you feel like it!",0

Granted, some of the lines seem a bit stiff, but overall the acting is better than any of the other Star Wars movies (Do they remember Mark Hamill?).  Hayden Christiansen did a great job.

Or when Obi-Wan Kenobi was fighting Count Dooku, he looked so helpless at that time, even before a fight, it was clear that Count Dooku is much more powerful. Though this trilogy is taking itself more serious, that doesn't bother me, I like when movie are taking themselves seriously. There were some good action sequences, especially in the end. I think that Anakin Skywalker's anger is well portrayed in this film and that is the most important in this trilogy. The only think I didn't like was that digital effects were used much to often in this film, sometimes it seemed that I'm watching cartoon not a film.",0
723,8.0,"The ""Star Wars"" saga is easily my favorite movie series of all time, and I have found enjoyment in every installment of the saga. ""Attack of the Clones"" is one of the three films in the series that I feel is underrated (the other two being ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Return of the Jedi""). To be honest, I wasn't even very interested in the ""Star Wars"" films until I saw this one and decided to pay more strict attention to it. I truly enjoyed this film, and it inspired me to go back and watch the earlier ones, which I fell in love with for the first time. This is definitely not the best film in the saga, and it ties with ""The Phantom Menace"" for my least favorite. Nevertheless, neither one of my least favorites is a bad film, and both are essential for the entire saga to play out. This film has some of the best dialogue of the three new ""Star Wars"" films. The love theme music is some of the best original music John Williams has written for the saga in quite some time. This movie also gives Yoda the best scenes he has been given since ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" particularly toward the end. It's not a perfect movie; the acting could be better, and some of the action scenes toward the end could have been cut down slightly. The film will not waste your time, however, and it is rich in character development and gives signs of what is yet to come in the saga.",1

This is an example of a big studio mercilessly cashing in on the loyalty of the fans by churning out mindless drivel like this, safe in the knowledge that loads of people will still flock to see it. The plot is slow and ponderous, the acting as wooden as in Phantom Menace. That young bloke who plays the future Darth Vader is one of the worst actors of all time. He seems to be in physical pain when he delivers his lines, so laboured are they. That Natalie Portman is a pretty girl for sure, but sadly she can't twin her natural talents with any gift for acting. Basically this film is mindless junk, so dull that any sane person would never watch it twice. Sci-fi in general is not my favourite genre, but this certainly doesn't convince me of its merits. Tripe!!!!!!!!!!",0
732,1.0,"This is terrible. Attack of the Clones doesn't do things that just infuriate Star Wars fans like the first prequel. There is no mention of midichlorians, and Jar-Jar is in it way less. In terms of insulting Star Wars fans this isn't as bad as ""The Phantom Menace"". In terms of which has less quality this one is worse. The dialogue is awful, and most of the actors are terrible. Anakin was extremely annoying in the first prequel, and he is even worse here. He complains all the time throughout the film, he is creepy, and is very unlikeable. The person who plays Anakin gives the worst performance in the film. Hayden Christensen is so bad that I want to punch him in the face. The dialogue he is given is shockingly bad, and he makes it sound even worse. The dialogue for everyone sounds less like Star Wars and more like a soap opera. Scratch that soap operas are way less cheesy. Then there is the worst thing about this thing. The romance between Anakin and Padme is the worst I have ever seen. The actors have no chemistry, the romantic dialogue is awful, Padme doesn't even seem to like Anakin until the script tells her to, Anakin does almost nothing right to make her fall in love with him, Anakin acts like a creepy stalker, it's extremely cliché, and it's the most forced romance ever. I would rather watch Jar-Jar sing in Star Wars on Ice than watch this romance again. It's that bad. There are a few things that are good about the movie. Christopher Lee as Count Dooko is great, and the score is excellent. Actually change that there is only two good things about the movie. The effects are good, but there is barely a scene that doesn't use a green screen or an effect. There is so much CGI that I felt like stabbing my eyes out. It feels so artificial. Even Yoda isn't even good in this movie. Frank Oz who was Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and the Star Wars film after this just isn't very wise. In Empire and Jedi he was a very wise, and was well acted from Frank Oz. When the prequels came along Yoda lost his wisdom. He stopped being interesting, and well acted by Frank Oz. Samul L Jackson doesn't fit the role he is given at all. The characters Jackson plays in his movies are usually badmouthed and violent. So when he was put in this movie what was he to do. Star Wars is largely geared towards kids so he couldn't start dropping F bombs. So he is given a role that is the exact opposite of what he is usually given. Therefor Jackson isn't given a chance to deliver a performance. It seemed to me that he was more reading his lines than acting. So Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie. Only two things I can find are actually good, and the rest is horrid.",0

But I'm appalled at how poorly made Attack of the Clones was, and surprised that Lucas would release such a poorly-thought out and made film. Some of the CGI is just plain bad. I won't harp on the dialogue or acting, but as a Star Wars fan, it's just a bad Star Wars film. The characters are largely stupid, the action scenes have no meaning and feel disconnected from the plot, and much of the character motivation is either stupid or missing altogether. Lucas fails utterly to make central character Anakin sympathetic, and the weak plot with gaping holes does nothing to make up for this. Most people are raving about the big fight at the end and the Yoda vs. Dooku match, but to me the whole arena sequence was just an extended excuse for juvenile antics. Yoda's fight is reminiscent more of Daffy Duck's antics than of anything that belongs in Star Wars. Truly a letdown on every level.",0

Lucas has totally screwed the pooch on The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. One can only hope that Episode III is better than these two wastes of film stock. Like the first film, Attack of the Clones's only saving grace is the special effects. The rest of the film is a disgrace to the original trilogy.

This has been established awhile ago, in the earlier movies. Secondly, you have to realize that although we know what is going to happen in the next few years for Anakin, Padme, etc., the characters do not. SO when someone comments on the whole forbidden love issue, and claims it is over done, clearly they do not understand the movie. The whole point of them emphasizing the forbidden love is because it is FORBIDDEN. Anakin takes a bold step being the only Jedi that loves, and as a result, evil things happen (eventually in Episode III). Visually, this movie is amazing, and will keep you entertain, rest assured. Also, someone said the whole Star Wars series is not a legacy. How dare a human with this belief be allowed to breathe the same air as me, because apparently they have no idea of past movie sales for any Star Wars films, let alone the craze that it has developed over the lase twenty-something years. In AOTC we learn so many things that weren't answered in previous films, such as the beginning of Storm Troopers, the rise of Senator Palpatine (aka the future Emperor...no that is not a spoiler, because it has been publically noted that that will happen in Episode III), and we see Bobba Fett as a child, and most importantly, we see exactly how Darth Vader is in his youth. This movie is incredible, and the fact that it is a mere $5.50 (student fare) is highway robbery.

Lucas went wrong with that film because rather than retaining the style of the original trilogy, he was too keen to make the movie friendly to new audiences, and more specifically; a young audience, which made the film lacking in many older Star Wars fans eyes. Thankfully, by the time of the second sequel, Lucas seems to have learnt his lesson and the film has a much more adult slant to it, plus it has that lovely 'Star Wars' feel, so it comes across as being much more linked to the original trilogy of films. The story this time round makes for an exciting ride, and it sees the first real steps towards the original trilogy of films. We catch up with our lead characters sometime after The Phantom Menace, in the midst of a galactic war. Separatist leaders have gathered their collective armies and now, under the command of the mysterious Count Dooku, are posing a serious threat to the Republic, and when you add this to an assassination plot and a love story between Luke and Leia's parents, Anakin and Padmé, we've got a film on our hands!

749,10.0,Star Wars:Episode 2 can have it's greatest qualities defined in one word. ACTION! Because this movie is full of it. with a story that keeps you head spinning the entire two plus hours and an ending that makes you beg Lucas to make three now. While some die hard fans and critics could never agree the movie compares to the original trilogy. I say it many ways it does. Unlike Phantom Menace. clones have brought back the essence of the original and have managed to entertain beyond what I imagined. This is the first film in years I have gone to see more than once.,1

751,1.0,"This movie absolutely amazed me and left me wondering.  When did it really all go to hell?  I like the original Star Wars movies.  There nothing mind-shattering, but they're good.  They certainly aren't good enough to have become what they became.  An American institution.  Moviegoers everywhere feel obligated to go see Episode II, even though Episode I was awful, because, well it's Star Wars.  And I saw it too.  But I saw it for free and still felt cheated.  The movie has no heart.  The dialogue is awful( fans say all the movies have bad dialogue and that's Star Wars ) The directing is flat, and yes I'll say that the special effects were awful.  I enjoy a pretty landscape as much as the next guy, but in the end, I'm not gonna like the movie because of some establishing shots.  The CG characters stick out like a sore thumb.  The characters never really look like their anywhere( they often don't cast shadows or reflections ).  The action scenes were boring( the clone factory one in particular ).  And as for the big Yoda scene.  I didn't see what the big deal was.  It was as forgettable as the rest of the movie.  Sure, the story is starting to piece together and there is no arguing that George Lucas has a vivid imagination.  But the movie just left a terrible sour taste in my mouth.  Let's hope it's mediocre box office sways him into making a decent movie next time and not worry about how many digital projection systems they'll be.",0

754,3.0,"In my review of The Phantom Menace, which was quite favorable, I stated that making any kind of a prequel is a daunting task, as your audience generally knows where you are headed.  In order to do so and be successful you had better introduce some interesting, well rounded, well acted characters, and enough plot twists and surprises to keep the audience riveted and wanting to come back to find out what happens next.  While I thought George Lucas was off to a fairly good start in The Phantom Menace, in Attack of the Clones, he seems to have lost his way.  He now seems so intent to dazzle us with technology that he has forgotten some of the important things that audiences care about, such as a good script, good acting,  character development, and having the audience actually care about what happens to those characters he puts in the middle of all those dazzling special effects.  I can only guess that he has become so enamored of the technical side of film making, that nothing else seems to matter.  If you want to tell your story, tell your story, but don't shortchange your audience in the process.",0

I own ALL of the other Star Wars movies, yes even Phantom, and have the dubious distinction of being one of only 4 people in the world who have not lambasted Phantom for 2 years now, and the only one without the last name of Lucas.

759,7.0,"Hayden Christensen's acting is somewhat wooden in this movie. Although, looking back at Mark Hamill's performance he's probably not too bad. Natalie Portman is somewhat better but not by much. She basically is in the movie for eye candy appeal, which she's quite good at. While the movie is okay to watch, it just does not have the magic of the old 1977 original. That movie was fun to watch because the idea was new and the whole universe Lucas created was great to watch on film. A whole slew of sci-fi and fantasy movies were made over the next few years copying Star Wars. Lucas continued on with his series of movies, but by the third movie, enough was enough. These last recent offerings were made for the sake of money, not art. There are no surprises in the recent movies, they're just completing the story set up by the first three movies. When will Hollywood stop rehashing the same old ideas just for money's sake? There are a lot of new ideas, never put on film, waiting on the shelves of the local library.

764,,"Is this the worst film ever made? Spoiler warning.  If you have not seen this film, please do not read on.  I would hate to spoil this incredibly moving, heart-warming, inspirational film for anyone. ""Attack of the Clones"" is the latest class project from the inmates at the Lucasfilm Asylum.  It follows on from the badly-received but commercially successful ""Phantom Menace"".  That last movie was a hideous mess of tedious dialogue, endless scenes where people sat around talking, pointless action sequences crammed in for no other reason than to sell video-game spin-offs, and banal special effects.  This new effort has been described by many as ""darker"" than the first.  Certainly, many of the scenes do take place at night.  It has also been described as ""better"" than the first.  Certainly, the audience I saw it with seemed to be having a great time, laughing uproariously at all the hilarious hijinks.  Causing particular amusement was the rib-tickling scene in which Anakin (""played"" by some computer-generated imbecile, as far as I could tell) goes back to find his mother.  He arrives just in time for her to say, ""I love yuuuurrrrghhhh"" and die in his arms. Brilliant!  With tears of laughter rolling down my face I marvelled at the wondrous imagination at play in this amazing movie.  What insight, what depth of feeling, what magnificent storytelling.  He arrives.  He finds her with no difficulty whatsoever.  She, upon laying eyes on him for the first time in eleven years, does not say, ""Where the **** have you been you selfish Jedi tw*t?"" or words to that effect.  She does not ask him why he did not try to rescue her eleven years ago.  He, in turn, does not question why anyone would pay money for someone to be a slave and then let her die (of what?  Boredom, probably).  It is very convenient he arrived when he did, though.  A minute later and she would have already been dead, and he would not know whether or not she loved hiurhhhhhggghhhh. Meanwhile, young Anakin is falling in love with a woman he last met when he was a little boy.  He has aged eleven years.  She has only aged three.  Do not ask questions.  Questions disrupt the balance of the force.  They fall in love.  She is a beautiful Queen/Princess/Senator.  She has no other admirers.  Who can explain this?  Do not ask questions. ",0
765,10.0,"Loved it.  Some of the acting was bad (expected), some of the dialogue was bad (expected), the love scenes were cheezy (expected), the action and effects, superb and lets face it thats why we were there.  Few believed that they could carry off Yoda in combat but he was great the coolest character since Han Solo went in to carbonite.  In short a great movie, Star Wars will never regain the charm of the originals but how could it without Ford, Fisher and Hamill, and why should it everything moves on.",1

But it does have a pretty complex story that can get confusing, it a good movie, but don't try to understand the logic, your brain will explode. Episode 2 is fun, it's a nice ride that can really can make you head spin, for the most part, but the few times its boring, its really boring and almost ruins the film.

The dominance of bounty hunter jengo and the way he killed one of the jedi, the awesome power of mace windu, as he beheaded the bounty hunter. The strength of Count doku, and the ""episode 6, emperor like"" lightning, defeating two Jedis, and finally the GREATEST SCENE IN STAR WARS HISTORY, THE FIRST YODA BATTLE!!!

Two: Natalie Portman. When she loses her proper Amidala accent, she just becomes another hack who seems like she's striving to overdo everything. Three: the writing is *terrible*. Example: Anakin's whiny speech of ""They're like animals! I hate them! I hate them all!"" Four: the film seems to be on waxy digital overload. One often wonders why there is no blue or green on anybody's costume. That leads us to five, the most egregious offense of all. *They made Yoda a CG character!* What in Obi-Wan's name possessed them? Sure, he has that awe-inspiring duel with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku, but he-- like most of the rest of the movie-- looks like he does not really exist.",0

Palpatine is extremely two-faced and it is very visible how he turns to the Emperor from the Supreme Chancellor.  (In case you didn't know...Darth Sidious and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine are the exact same person.)  You can see how Anakin's anger leads him to be seduced by the dark side.  Palpatine is already seducing Anakin to the dark side by telling him he is the greatest of all Jedi.  Jar Jar Binks had limited screen time which is EXCELLENT!

The young boy who played Skywalker in the 1999 movie really did a good job, and there is some great acting in Attack of the Clones as well. For example, Christopher Lee in a menacing role. Moreover, I think there were some great focus on details and it had the flavor of the real Star Wars merchandise. The assassin-robot is just great. I mean, the mercenary. Moreover, from a science-fiction point of view it is hard to see anything more visionary these days than what came out of the Star Wars saga.

This job eventually leads to Obi-Wan being separated from Anakin while he investigates the assassin who happens to be involved with a cloning conspiracy and this later leads him to a renegade Jedi master played by Christopher Lee. Guess what? Anakin still has the hots for Padme and whilst Obi-Wan is away Anakin would like nothing better than to strip her naked and get her in the sack.

When I saw him act in the scene after he brings home his dead mother's body and talks about how unfair it is that he couldn't save her, I was actually intimidated. Not only is George Lucas setting up Anakin's tragic flaw, which is a traditional character trait of a Shakespearean tragic hero, but he is also foreshadowing the next movie where Anakin is going to give into a lust for power and anger and make the same mistake. In doing so, he will lose all his humanity and the one he loves most). However, the element that stood out most for me was the music score. The love theme that John Williams composed is so beautiful that it makes me feel so sad that Anakin and Padme's love is doomed.

It came out on video today and I managed to get it as a free rental, and it just stunk. I can only imagine how much more pathetic the next one will be. It's hard to believe that Lucas is able to talk investors into giving him money to create garbage. Hmmm. I can now understand how easy it was for Enron to do what they did.",0

807,10.0,"Attack of the Clones is the Best effort by George Lucas since Empire Strikes back. In fact, in my opinion, it comes pretty close to Episode IV and V. The only problem was the ""love story"" aspect. The unfortunate part is that is an integral part of the movie (storyline), so I know it had to be done. Hayden Christensen (I think that is how you spell it) does an UNBELIEVABLE job as Anakin aka Darth Vader. His facial expressions, and eyes tell EVERY emotion, and you can see his frustrations that will eventually turn him to the DARK SIDE!",1
808,7.0,STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a wonderful romp through the STAR WARS universe. Some of the best overall action scenes in the series take place right here. But the film feels like it was cut in half... because it was. This is not a movie in and of itself: it is the first half of a movie that is *not* completed in the next STAR WARS movie (REVENGE OF THE SITH) -- it is completed in the absolutely fantastic Cartoon Network Clone Wars shorts (both the First and Second series).,1
809,1.0,"After the Phantom Menace came out in 1999, George Lucas got some backlash so he decided to retaliate against humanity with Attack of the Clones.

810,3.0,"Attack of the Clones amplifies its predecessor's mistakes. Anakin has mild depth as the protagonist, but he's generic and static. He never develops or shows layers behind his angst. Instead, his repetitive dialogue announces his feelings. Plus, his romance with Padme is cringey because there's no emotional connection. They have no chemistry, influence, or warmth. Meanwhile, the plot is disengaging. Politics are silly, information is limited, and the result is emotionally inconsequential. Viewers won't care when the narrative is needlessly illogical, confusing, and unrelatable. Furthermore, the actors struggle with this trite material. Thus, Attack of the Clones is lifeless.",0
811,5.0,"Beautifully shot with fine special effects, but overlong and dull story wise and Obi-Wan Kenobi( Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) are boring characters.<br /><br />Also, there's too many scenes with Anakin and Padme (Natalie Portman) .<br /><br />The whole thing feels like charmless film by numbers.",0
812,4.0,"First of all I enjoyed the first of the Star Wars prequels and I thoroughly hate this film. Now you probably ask yourselves how one man can like the first Episode and not the second? The answer is actually pretty simple, dialog. The dialog in this film is ridiculously bad. I don't know how Lucas could come up with lines as cheesy as they were in this film. Now the dialog in the other Star Wars films is far from perfect but then again Lucas never really mastered dialog and thus it didn't make that much of an impact on me but the dialog was just so fake and unreal in this film that it sometimes made me want to laugh out loud. You can almost see the characters struggle with the dialog. Some more successful than others.",0
813,10.0,"Right in sinc with the triliological mind of George Lucas this one left me feeling dark and wanting more. Just like The Empire Strikes Back we see prime examples of the definite line between good and evil. I love how diabolical Count Dooku's character is. How confused Anakin is about everything. With his loyalties to the Jedi order, and Padme at the same time, no wonder he's so moldable by Palpatine. We will see the definite fall and transformation of Skywalker in Episode III. This is a captivating tale for all ages. Shame on any critic for saying bad things about something so beautifully scripted, portrayed, and directed. Maybe they're jealous of Lucas' success. Nah they just don't really love movies like the rest of us do. They probably haven't had fun at the movies...well... ever.",1

816,8.0,"Attack of the Clones is a typical member of the Star Wars series in the sense that it has all the good ingredients but the common flaws as well. Great special effects, which provides for sometimes astonishingly beautiful backgrounds of the cities in particular (I quite like the retro-inspired design of the spaceships too), the never-ending struggle between good and evil, personalised in the two generations of Skywalkers, and of course the sloppy romantic scenes. AOTC has the best specials effects you've ever seen, but for those who thought that the love-interest between Leia and Han was rather hair-raising, beware, because AOTC sets a new standard in that field too. Anakin is a whiny brat with the emotional capacity of a six year old, who tries to seduce Amidala with lines that have less romantic power than a list of ingredients on a pizzadelivery order form. No blame on Haydn Christensen, for even Brad Pitt couldn't have been interesting for Amidala with this kind of dialogue or role. She's a strong, independent woman, and there's no overwhelming chemistry between them blasting from the screen to give at least the smallest of an excuse for her being attracted to him. It's a shame, because I can imagine a lot of people dislike the film because of this subplot, when for the rest, after the terrible Phantom Menace, AOTC is among the best in the Star Wars series: a more complex plot than the Episodes 4 to 6, which poses intriguing questions and makes one look forward to Ep 3, a dark, gloomy atmosphere, lot's of action-packed sequences, an *ss-kicking Yoda, and, as mentioned before, excellent SE and design. Lucas should have hired a ghostwriter for the romance, for now he missed a chance to make a truly memorable SW-film again. 8/10",1

822,6.0,"10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace, a new separatist movement threatens the republic while Anakin Skywalker, now a formidable Jedi Padawan, is stuck in a hideous romantic sub plot and must choose between his Jedi duties and forbidden love. The Phantom Menace isn't a bomb, but it's something of a dud thanks to the awful writing and acting. Attack of the Clones, while undoubtedly an improvement, suffers from many of these issues. The most compelling character in the movie is CGI Yoda. Seriously. Christopher Lee is good as a new villain, although he seems slightly on autopilot, Ian McDiarmid is genuinely solid as Chancellor Palpatine and Ewan McGregor improves on his bland work in The Phantom Menace. But Jar Jar Binks is still awful, even if the writers thoughtfully laid some of the blame for the republic's downfall on his shoulders, Natalie Portman is terrible, Samuel L Jackson phones it in, Boba Fett is played by a terrible child actor and worst of all, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, who will one day be Darth Vader, is more wooden and less complex than a rocking chair and only slightly more lively.",0

824,5.0,"Attack of the Clones hit the theaters a week after the first Spiderman movie did. It was after watching the two movies one after the other that it hit me as to why I didn't like the Star Wars movies anymore (and why I loved the first two in particular so much). Spiderman had good dialog, a compelling story, and interesting characters who I cared about. Conversely, in Clones I didn't give a damn what happened to anyone in it. In all three ""prequel"" movies we see George Lucas' journey into special effects and cartoon character/CGI excess, but it's on display the most here..or maybe it's just that the dialog and characters are so weak that it just seems like it (Sith takes the prize for the most bells and whistles effects-wise). I realized that without fun, likable good guys and interesting bad guys to root for and against, all the effects and shoot 'em ups are pretty boring. Make that REALLY boring. And then Lucas tries to do a love story on top of that and proceeds to butcher it (I remember when he used to be able to direct..think the first Star Wars and American Graffiti). You should be able to do something with a doomed love affair to make it interesting, and Lucas does everything he can to suck the life out of it. Anakin Skywalker and Padme are so boring (and in the case of Anakin, irritating) that you wonder how they could possibly be Luke and Leia's real parents (switched at birth perhaps?) I also fault the performances, and Hayden Christenson's portrayal of Anakin in particular, but in his defense he had nothing to work with script-wise. The only remotely interesting character is Christopher Lee's too-little-seen Count Dooku. Otherwise, it's Lucas and his world of CGI cartoon characters and video-game action sequences.

To start off with, it is even worse than the Phantom menace, the acting is appalling, the chemistry between Padme and Anakin is non-existent. Even Ewan McGregor (who is normally fantastic) gives a very sub-par performance. Granted, the original Star Wars trilogy didn't exactly have a stellar script, but at least you didn't cringe. Plus, the performances in the old ones (considering they are action films) is actually decent. The problem with these new films is the lack of a Han Solo or Chewbacca character (Jar Jar Binks doesn't count). Alas, people will watch it (or will have to) in order to understand the third one. Although exactly what the plot was in this one is beyond me, nothing actually happened.",0

The last 20 minutes or so are impressive, yes, but they don't save the entire film. When this movie isn't focused on the dull love story, it shows the uninteresting adventures of Obi-Wan or tortures us with political mumbo-jumbo.

From the oh-so-full-of-convenient-coincidences of the car race through the city to the horrendously clunky dialogue between two actors deserving of the Golden Raspberry (Christiansen and Portman -- ye gods!), this movie was a groanfest from start to finish.  No one looked comfortable or sounded at ease having to mouth such inanities.  There was MAYBE 25 minutes of actual coherent plot that was necessary to the story.  Other than that, it was just whiplash from one end of the galaxy to the other with people doing things for no real reason.  Why was Jango Feet introduced at all?  Just to give motive for Bobba's personality later on?  I dunno.  It was a screwed-up mess and by the time the first hour was over, I really didn't care.  I just watched it to the end hoping that Christopher Lee could salvage it from total mediocrity and he did to a small degree.  Although fighting a pinwheeling muppet (OK, CGI he may be, but I liked the old Yoda better) isn't exactly a diginifed use of celluloid, or for a veteran actor like Lee for that matter.  Peter Jackson used Lee's talents to greater distinction as Saruman.",0

860,1.0,"Excessive effects and poor plot. Star Wars, for any diehard fan, was a legendary trilogy, we were waiting for nothing less. But it seems George Lucas has decided to trade one of the finest pieces of film into the commercial industry of Special Effects. Star Wars was beyond special effects. The characters, in contrast to the original trilogy (Episode IV to VI), seem cartoonish instead of intriguing. It also contradicts the force in Yoda, who explains so many times to Luke in the original trilogy, how things are only large in someone's head, and not harder to move, when he saves OB1 and Anakin. Too extreme a gap also between the ""can I play Mommy, can I play mommy"" Anakin in Episode 1 to a dark Anakin in Episode 2 while he could have fixed it by playing Anakin in Ep. 1 stronger, darker, more focused. And the names! Tyrannus! This has become a cartoon, not a movie anymore. Special effects and sound might be great, but a legend has turn into ""one more in the rack"".",0
861,10.0,"As just about everybody disliked the Phantom Menace for many reasons; Jar Jar, little Anakin, weak villains, and what does it have to do with the other Star Wars trilogy besides having Obi-Wan and Anakin in it? Well this Star Wars is not only a much better movie, it makes Phantom Menace look like a better movie; Anakin gets touchy when he's being insulted, the Trade Federation going down and then nearly starting the Clone War, Anakin leaving his mother which nearly pushes him over the edge. This film perfectly sets things up for Episode III and the rest of the saga; Palpatine gaining almost all control, a great decline in Jedi Knights from the Battle of Geonosis which will make them easier to wipe out by Palpatine, a whole army at his command, Anakin starting his path to the dark side. For the people who didn't like this one and/or Episode I, I think will appreciate the films much more once they're all complete. The movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen, it comes in third with the Star Wars saga, just behind Empire and Star Wars. Ewan McGregor was my favorite guy to watch on screen, he does a much better job than he did in Menace and we want to see more of him. Portman is much better too, she doesn't speak in the monotone that killed her performance in Menace. Hayden, a brilliant actor in which we know he's gonna become Vader but we still think of him as our hero beside McGregor. The visuals were extraordinary, action scenes blew me away, the love story, not my type of Vodka but they live in a totally different place than us, people off in space on other worlds aren't gonna go up to a chick and say, ""Hey baby, what up? Can I buy you a drink?"" I believed the love story, Anakin probably did what we all wish we could do, put his feelings into exact words. But, the one thing that you have to like, even if you hated everything else, is Yoda. Oh my God! I just about wet my pants when I saw him fight, and so did just about the rest of the theatre. (I saw it at midnight, opening night) We all cheered at four points; when Yoda walked out, when Yoda did a little Bruce Lee-like pose, when Yoda whipped out his lightsaber, and then the entire fight scene.

My personal favorite Star Wars goes like this Empire, A New Hope, Jedi-didn't like the muppets much, and then Phantom Menace. Films in my home collection run from Gladiator to James Bond and the Mummy. I must say the Phantom Menace was watchable but not a great movie to me. Jar Jar drove me crazy with his slapstick, and my nephews and nieces that I thought would get a buzz from seeing Star Wars thought it just Ok. My wife fell asleep, though she enjoys watching the originals. I recently saw episode two. I loved it, so did my nieces, nephews and wife. The story kept moving along at a good pace. The settings were amazing. If romance was not your cup of tea it would soon move back to Obi's detective story and the last 45mins were a blast. The politics,my nieces and nephews did not seem to understand, but for me were the most interesting part of the story, how everyone was being manipulated. In the Phantom Menace there were some good surroundings but the characters didn't seem to interact with them in this film you could see the depth to the city and felt as part of the locations. I felt actually cold out there in the rain with Obi in part of the movie. The dialogue in the romance scenes was a little corny but I'm used to that from the Star Wars universe, I've also sprouted some pretty corny lines myself when young and in love.

I would have thought that the film would have earned more money by now.  But oh well, it is still traditional star wars.  The mushy love scenes weren't too bad at all and tied together the way Luke and Leia were created.  I only wished Anakin and the two lightsaber fight with Dooku would have lasted longer.  Also, Obi Wan seemed tougher in the first movie, but oh well.  I can't wait to see the next part when he and Anakin fight.  By the way, what ever happens to Padme, Mace Windu, and the other Jedi? Yoda is Still the man.  Up until now we have all wondered why this little green freak was so much of a great and esteemed Jedi.  Now we know.  He wasn't larger when younger or shrink with age.  He was always a kick butt Jedi.  Go Lucas, Why do we have to wait three more years for the next one?",1

Yet, after viewing it in an almost packed theater, and a few times since at home, I am assured it is a return to form after the very good but lacking TPM. Director/Co-writer George Lucas returns to the vivacity and great visual splendor he had in his original trilogy, and thank goodness, Jar Jar Binks was kept very minimal here. This time there's room for some new creations, though more than anything it's more of a mystery movie than anything else- also one of loss.",1

Natalie Portman was extremley beautiful in this film, George always manages to get the beautiful women in his movies.

886,10.0,"Review of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones There is always a mixed sense of anticipation and excitement in air when a new Star Wars movie hits the theater. I'm going to lay this statement down now that this review is currently rough because I've only seen the movie once since it hit the big screen. There is a ton going on in this film, that one theatrical viewing isn't just enough. Well before I start sounding more like a Frito-Lay commercial then a stunned fan; who saw movie magic a mire eighteen hours ago. After seeing the opening crawl were instantly taken away from the beginning and more innocent story of The Phantom Menace. Attack of the Clones fully embraces us with cruelty of life. Immediately we see signs of death; first there are the Senator Padme Amidala assassination attempts, which leads us through the lower depths of Coursant. After that, the movie revolves around death and separation.  George Lucas and John Hales never stray from this fact; they keep it honest and truthful. Throughout the movie Lucas gives an ugly look at war, and how death affects us. While the popular thing these days is to be patriotic; Lucas goes in the exact opposite direction he reminds us that no matter how much we think were right, hurting others also hurts ourselves.  Which leads to the main focus of the film, Anikin Skywalker throughout the film we see him make poor choices, but he still has a good heart. Anikin seems to want to fall into a different destiny that the Jedi Council asks him to serve.  This is what makes the movie absolutely great. Everyone character in the film seems to sense this and center itself toward Anikin as change completely takes shape. Attack of the Clones drives us deep into the Star Wars Saga, it evolves the story straight off of The Phantom Menace and stays dedicated to the original trilogy. On that note, this movie is still definitely Present Trilogy; people who dogged TPM for the CG will dog the CG in this movie. As for myself the adrenaline rushes I get from watching dozens of gorgeous worlds and species is to much to bare, you just got to bask in its riches.  This movie is definitely worth a few theatrical viewings. On the technical side of things, the dialog was typical for a Star Wars film wooden but forgivable.  For once the rocky dialog paid off for Star Wars as the love scenes which seemed to be very cheesy, but when you think of the characters Padme and Anikin, they really are such high regarded people with infinite amount of intelligence that knowing how to express feelings is going to lead to shady communication. This film is a complete through back to The Empire Strike Back; the similarities are very eerie.  Obi-Wan provides the wit comedy of Han Solo, Anikin provides the recklessness, but gifted student like his son Luke, Jango provides his cleverness and loyalty like his son, Count Dooku adds the confidence and treachery of Darth Vader, Mace Windu adds an edge, and Yoda redefines the phrase ""Bustin' out the Woopin' Stick."" All in all, a sweet film for the world to enjoy.",1
887,8.0,"I am one of those few people that actually thought that Episode 1, The Phantom Menace was quite good.  I'm not saying that it was as good as Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back or even the original Star Wars but for popcorn entertainment it was really enjoyable.",1
888,10.0,"I, along with scores of millions across the globe, waited with near hysteric anticipation to see the second installment of George Lucas' second Star Wars trilogy; I was not disappointed. Far from it in fact, as I was absolutely overjoyed with the fruits of Lucas' mammoth labor. The film is quite simply fantastic, and a stunning example of George Lucas' genius as a filmmaker. It not only boasts quite simply, the best special effects ever seen in any motion picture, but an all-star cast who put in (despite some asinine remarks to the contrary) magnificent performances all. The music is (as always with John Williams) utterly superb, and there was rarely a moment (save perhaps the occasional love scene that went on a wee bit too long) that you lose interest in the plot. And dear god; Yoda's heroic finale is a moment of utter cinematic genius.",1
889,7.0,"I love Episode 1 and 3, but 2 has always been one of the most terrible Star Wars movies. There is still a lot to love about it though. It has some amazing action sequences, great lightsaber battles, imaginative locations, etc. The biggest problem with the movie is when the plot is split in half and we check in every once in a while with Annakin. We just check in to see him moping and talking about sand. Every time we check in with Obi-wan, it is amazing. But when we check back to Annakin... not so much. The romance is odd because the guy was a kid when he met her, it just doesn't make any sense why she would view him as anything other than a kid.<br /><br />However, the last part of the film is amazing. We get to see Yoda finally fight with a lightsaber, which a lot of us always wanted to get a glimpse of. It was amazing to watch, and to this day is mezmerizing. What a fight!",1
890,2.0,"Star Wars: Episode 2: Attack of the Clones (2002): Dir: George Lucas / Cast: Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiamid: Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away there lived a director named George Lucas who made great films such as THX 1138, American Graffiti and Star Wars. Since then he has ventured into the dark side of Hollywood making two embarrassing Star Wars prequels. Title regards diversion much like its advertising. Queen Amidala is now a Senator and young Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his mentor Obi Wan Kenobi are assigned to protect her. A poison dart leads Kenobi to a cloning planet where he discovers Junga Fett as a threat. Meanwhile Anakin attempts to get into the pants of the Senator, and Lucas even treats viewers to an embarrassing roll in the meadows. Breathtaking special effects accompany ridiculous storytelling and dreadful acting by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman with Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee submerged in cardboard roles. Lee plays the villain Count Dooku who is given a light saber battle against Yoda, which is either a surprise or a joke judging from its staging, Ian McDiamid plays the Emperor whose job is to sh*t disturb and cause divisions in the force. Jedi master or not. Mindless spectacle that should be re-titled ""Attack of the Clowns."" Score: 2 / 10",0

892,4.0,"""Attack of the Clones"", while not the worst of the lot, feels the least like a Star Wars movie. It's a very weird feeling. But there's also a very slipshod quality to it, at least from a writing standpoint. The Syfo Dyas thing could've been more fleshed out, Jango Fett is hardly a character that warrants so much screen time, and Anakin Skywalker is just such a lackluster character. I didn't care about him for a second (even while Lucas demands as much by killing off his mother), but then I didn't care about anybody in this movie. Again, very strange.",0
893,10.0,"This episode is the next best thing to The Empire Strikes Back. The Republic is shattering before the eyes of the politicians and the Jedi, thanks to the manipulations of Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious and his apprentice Count Dooku/Darth Tyranos. This movie has it all: numerous mythological and religious references, breathtaking scenery, and political intrigue. Yoda and Mace Windu demonstrate their superior lightsaber prowess. Anakin's moments of rage are chilling. The ending scene with Palpatine on a terrace overlooking his vast Empire to be is one of the most powerful moments ever to grace a cinema screen. The Jedi are completely oblivious to the fact that a powerful Sith master is controlling them like puppets. Lucas is creating a modern tragedy, one that will eventually be considered alongside the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles. How unfortunate that he is so widely misunderstood by shallow and self-contradictory critics and demagogues.",1

It supplies most of the emotion when dialogue and characterization doesn't. The primary theme of AOTC is no different, providing the kind of sweet melancholy a doomed love affair requires with an epic scope for the backdrop of war. It's incredibly beautiful and heart-achingly sad. Brief moments of tenderness caught on the battlefield as an even greater shadow looms- that's Across the Stars.",1

Now he looks different, more like the Yoda of the Episodes IV-VI and they might as well go back and draw computer animation over Yoda in Episode I because they invaded the other Episodes with animation. This movie has a lot of boring parts like where Anikin and the Queen fall in love. I find myself skipping to the next scenes. At least Jar-Jar isn't the lead star of this movie like in Episode I. Episodes I-III seem like they're made for kids, when the IV-VI seem like more serious science fiction movies.",0

It contained (1) the beginning of the clone wars (Who didn't want to see that?!), (2) it also contained an older, more whiny, evil Anakin. Along with that, (3) we got so see where the Stormtroopers originated along with (4) Boba Fett. Okay, so this movie sounds pretty darn good just by reading that paragraph!",1
902,6.0,"Episode II was better than Episode I, but that doesn't really mean to much considering how bad Episode I was.  AOTC was just your average summer movie with a bad plot and VERY BAD dialogue.

Indeed from a lot of the views coming from the critics and public, this was supposed to be a return to the pleasures of 'Empire Strikes back'. It has the multi-strand plotlines, but that's about it. The acting is far worse, the plots are so intricate that they don't really make sense, and ironically I didn't think the special effects are that convincing. Yea sure, they were obviously state of the art CGI, but you felt like you were watching 2 movies. The live action bits and then the bits where the characters would step into a sumptuous video game.",0
908,6.0,"Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" misses the mark for me. It has quite a few really good scenes but overall it's too long and too plot heavy. The scenes that really drag ""Attack of the Clones"" down are the ones with Padme and Anakin. When the two of them are on screen together time stands still. Their ""romance"" is wildly uninteresting. Whenever I watch this movie I find myself fast forwarding through those scenes. Doing that makes ""Attack of the Clones"" way more enjoyable.",1

After all, it had lightsaber duels, dazzling battle scenes, giant monsters, Yoda fighting, and of course, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) was reduced to little more than a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo. It seemed as though George Lucas had listened to the many complaints made about the previous film and took these on board when developing the next script. I did see it again at the cinema, and a few more times on DVD, and each time I disliked it more and more. It became apparent that I had blinkers on in 2002, and I was simply relieved that it wasn't the stilted mess it had been 3 years earlier.

Jango gets sends a shapeshifter to kill Padme. The Shapeshifter sends killer worms to kill Padme. Yes you heard it..killer worms. This movie is terribly boring. Anakin Is a huge prick in this movie and he and Obi Wans are almost never on good terms. Obi Wan, Anakin, and Padme are again very boring in this movie.

913,3.0,"OK, now as I have said in my other Star Wars Prequel Reviews, I will do my utmost to give this film a fair review and point out anything that is good if I find it. OK, let's start with the plot; This film is set 10 years after the events of ""Episode I"" and Queen turned Senator Amidala of Naboo is returning to Coruscant to vote on the creation of a ""Grand Army of the Republic"" to counter the uprising Sepratist Movement, when an attempt is made on her life. Fearing that she may be in mortal danger, Chancellor Palpatine asks the Jedi Council to place the senator under their protection. Enter the now adult Anakin Skywalker, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi. After another attempt is made on the Senator's life, the Jedi Council decide to send Anakin away with her to her home planet of Naboo where they hope she'll be safe, while Obi-Wan goes off to pursue a lead on the planet of Kamino, where he discovers a secretly manufacture Army of Clones. At the same time, Anakin and Padme slowly begin to fall in love. At the same time, Anakin is racked by horrid dreams of his mother being tortured on his home planet of Tatooine, and leaves Naboo with Amidala to find her. Upon arriving, he quickly meets his step father and takes flight after his mother, only to find her as she is dying. As she dies in his arms, he looses all control of himself and slaughters the entire village of the Sand People who kidnapped his mother. While this is happening, Obi-Wan confronts the man responsible for the two failed attempts on Padme's life and, and after a brief confrontation, he pursues the man (Jango Fett) to the Septatist Base World of Geonosis, where he discovers Count Dooku, a former Jedi, now leader of the Sepratist Movement, and Obi-Wan is captured. Answering his distress signal, Anakin comes to his aide, and he and Padme too are captured. As a demonstration of his power, Dooku orders the trio's execution in a giant arena, but as the final blow is about to be struck, Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jedi Master Yoda arrive with a force of Jedi Knights and Clone Troopers to hopefully save Anakin and Obi-Wan and capture Dooku and stop a full scale War. In the ferocity of the battle, Anakin and Ob-Wan face off with Dooku, who easily defeats the two and is about to kill them until Yoda shows up and saves them, but Dooku escapes and the war begins, thus we have a sequel yet again.",0

With Episode II, I have been put off seeing the remaining four films as it was, in truth, a complete waste of my time: The acting was bad, the plot tiresome, the delivery of the script awful, the themes unspectacular and the CGI being used as a bit of a cop out once everything bad had been established; even the annoying clicking noises the aliens used to communicate with were a disaster.",0

McGregor is back as Obi Ben. He does a fine job as do Star War stalwarts Samuel Jackson, Frank Oz(as Yoda), the droid actors, Ian McDiarmind, and Natalie Portman. The great horror icon Christopher Lee appears as the nemesis Count Dooku(not crazy about the name either) and is wonderful. The man is in his eighties and still exudes poise and commanding presence. My biggest problem acting-wise is Hayden Christiansen as the soon-to-be-Darth Vadar. I just didn't ""buy"" him nor found him convincing at all.

I am as huge a fan as the next guy, but I won't let my love for something I've known since I was 2 yrs old blind me to what I experienced when I saw Episode II. I've never believed that Lucas was a great director. Seeing this movie drives that home.  Way back when, in fact, I did not like the idea that he would be directing these prequels.  McGregor, Jackson and Portman are awesome performers but Lucas can turn any talented actor/actress into what looks like an amateur reading their lines off cue cards for the first time. The performances were awful.  (Lucas's fault) I was trying to get into the story, but I just wasn't feeling it.  The screenplay was just totally erratic.  The movie had no flow what so ever. As a fan of Star Wars, I honestly tried really hard to find something in this movie that I liked.  I couldn't.  The only satisfaction I have now is that I'm one step closer in the story to seeing how Anakin comes to be Vader.  I really can't even say this movie had a plot or a story.  It was just a sequence of events.  I think that Lucas takes for granted what the audiences all ready know about the outcome of Anakin's demise.  This is a big mistake on Lucas's part. If you like special effects, you're in for a treat.  The movie was a special effects and CGI overkill.  All I can say to Lucas is...""Get off the Mac and try to develop a decent screenplay first."" Once again, I love Star Wars, but i have to be honest with myself and to people want to see good movies.",0

They've touted it as, ""...a return to the old formula..."" for which the Star Wars Money Machine is known. That seems rather ignorant to me, as this is the second prequel installment, so of course more familiar elements will be demonstrated here than were in the first, as there will be even more in Episode III. That is a given. For them to proclaim that this is somehow superior to the Introduction that was Episode I because of those more familiar elements, is just asinine. Episode I, as an introduction, was perfectly presented. This work, however, was more focused on Luca$'s obsession with teen love and an homagic tribute to his ""America Graffiti,"" than any attempt at the actual meat of the Star Wars Saga.",1

It has awful dialogue, a bad plot focused on an uncomfortable romance that you don't buy as the actors have little chemistry and is poorly paced with the worst lightsaber fights of the franchise (you genuinely can't tell what's going on at certain points). Hayden Christensen gives a bad performance and most of the characters show little emotion. However, Ewan McGregor is reliably really good, Christopher Lee is a welcome addition and the third act has lots of action, making it enjoyable.

How is that possible? No girl wants a creep like that. He was such a nice young boy with so much potential in Episode 1, all he did was belly-ache and kill in this episode. He killed a whole race of people, not to say that they did not deserve it, but a Jedi can not act that way. In this movie Yoda was the only character that kept the dignity of the Jedi. Yoda was the only Jedi that did not get his butt kicked in the flick. I thought Jedi were supposed to be strong and save the world? And whats with the corny one liners? C3P0 says, ""I am beside myself"", as its severed head lays beside its body, and it also says, ""What a drag"", as its head is being dragged on the ground. Its barely laughable. There were too many things happening in this movie and none of them were dwelled upon long enough for you to understand it. The way this movie ended made me want to ask for my money back.

Episode II has a disatrously bad and cliche love plot that kills the first half of the movie. I've never seen less romantic or charismatic people on the big screen who were obviously trying very hard to be.  It was very sad to see.  The special effects and the fight scenes were fun but I got the feeling that the big, over the top fights were meant as a concession to viewers, in order to keep their attention for the third film.  The plot lacked any punch and the villains were decidedly uniteeresting thus removing a key element that made the original so popular, distinct, powerful villains.

Lucas is really however a great master of this kind of movies from the technical point of view, maybe the greatest one. The movie theme is the endless fight of good and evil expressing itself here in well built scenes of battles or individual duels of great strength and movement. This kind of movies for lack of imagination of what can be a different world in terms of towns, buildings, clothes, weapons and general behaviour, often recreate past centuries images with frequent reference to the Middle Age or even the antiquity. In this particular movie we have even the recreation of some kind of Roman Circus fighting with a lot of adaptation (lions replaced by monsters etc). One last word to characterize what in my opinion is a good sci-fi novel or movie. Not that one where Cowboys and Indians (or nazis and democratic armies) are replaced by people with futurist clothes and weapons but fighting for the same values as we know them today but a story where we are faced with fictional different values, a different social and social structure i. e. a really different world being the work of the author's creative mind.

Nobody loved A New Hope because the story was great. People who fell in love with it in the 70's did so because of the special effects and anybody who says different is either a bad judge of good plots or a liar.

For any movie that is. I do not understand, how, not sure what date Star Wars takes place, certainly in the distant future, we still have explosions. At the beginning of the movie when they attempt to kill the princess, when the space ship gets fired at, smoke comes out. Smoke ???? In year 2500, 3000? Come on! (Maybe petrol, and petrol companies, still control our lives!!!) What about lasers, melting, disappearing, etc. We had an atomic bomb in 1945, 69 years ago, and you show Star Wars in smoke. I'm sure, you can try better, at all levels. There must be consistency in MOVIES, when in one movie, a guy with super powers goes at lightening speed, and in the next scene, you see him fight with human speed. Anyone??

952,6.0,"Everyone knows that the prequel trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" universe is light-years far from the magical results George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan managed to pull off with the originals. However, I'm not inclined -like many hardcore fans- to completely destroy these movies as if they were some of the worst results in the history of cinema, and with Episode II, which I consider the halfway between the pretty bad I and the pretty good III, I have the chance to explain why. This film starts off as a pretty boring one, making the viewer fear for the worst, but as the plot progresses it shows its interesting political points and some impressive CGI scenes, if you consider that in the early 2000s this technology was the life itself for action/adventure motion pictures. It surely lacks the wonderfully amusing relationships and characters that developed in the originals (except C3PO and R2-D2, who are lovely as usual and are used in a more active way than ""Episode I""), and the ""love story"" between Anakin and Padmé is good only as a script, but fails on the actual complicity between the lead actors, who seem ashamed of taking on a romantic scene. That's one of the big problems here: Hayden Christensen is an awful actor and the single worst choice in the whole series of films also considering the key character he's entrusted with. Obviously he can't take all of the blame, as the man who should have directed him and the others in the right way apparently does nothing to help, with no acting direction at all (I hope!) and uninspired shots. That said, I will save this flick and brand it as an enjoyable one, when not considering the let-down you get knowing what kind of masterpieces George Lucas had been able to invent in the past (with the evidently needed help of his brilliant collaborators).",0

Attack Of The Clones is particularly pointless, again the thrust of this movie is relatively irrelevant, as we know who's pulling the strings and who's going to win and because the movie is as flatly directed and lamely acted as Phantom Menace, the action, politics and drama are largely banal.

My theory is that the last two film have far too much Computer animation which does not have the same appeal as the Models being filmed to look like aliens or space ships as they did in Star Wars. Also i dont like the cast. Ewan Mcgregor sounds naff when he puts on that Alec Guiness accent also i think as Natalie Portman has got older she has got a lot less interesting and less pretty.Samuel L Jackson is good but we see little of him to brighten the film up. What we really need is another Harrison Ford of Mark Hammel. The Story is nothing special but its hard to tell when your watching a cheap pirate DVD. Never again will i buy one.

968,6.0,"I hold Star Wars in such high esteem that I'm going to rip this movie way more than it deserves; it's relative to the other films. This is the only bad entry of the 6 films. It's so bad. The opening scene where the decoy Padme gets her ship blown up is done in such horrible fashion. It's presented horribly. There are no interesting cuts or details or anything. The scene didn't capture me at all, just lame. Then some Jedis talk some things out, and Anakin is put in charge of personally guarding and protecting Padme, (ok, great...this could lead to some great scenes) but it turns into a complete love story, and a lame love story at that, believe me. No good lines or exchanges between Padme and Anakin. Very Weak. Obi-Wan is given the task of investigating this Clone Army, and this results in the best part of the movie. Kenobi fights Jango Fett, a very cool scene, and then proceeds to follow his ship which is another very cool scene. It leads to Kenobi getting captured by Count Dooku, so Anakin and Padme have to come rescue him. Just when you think it might be finally picking up and getting good, it turns into the animated series Attack of the Clones and Skywalker ends up in a factory fighting a bunch of alien-bugs while having to use his Jedi prowess to avoid getting smashed in the assembly line. So bad. What potential for a scene, Anakin has to go save Kenobi from Dooku, and this is where Lucas takes it. Was he making this movie for 7 year olds? It goes on as they're all imprisoned and set to be eaten by a bunch of uncreative, lame creatures. So bad. Then the epic final battle breaks out with all the Jedis. Sounds great...not really. Most of the time they're fighting the same ol' droid with little variety, and really all you see is Jedis deflecting laser beams. Mace Windu does actually shine during this battle. His scenes are really good, but it's the only good part of the entire 'epic' battle. So Yoda swoops in to whoop some tail, wait, no, he's just there to give them a ride. OK. Whatever. Off to chase Dooku now, which is a decent scene, Yoda's really good at giving orders. Skywalker and Kenobi eventually catch Dooku and we are given a very nice lightsaber duel. Dooku is too strong, but then Yoda shows up. We get to see Master Yoda fight. Yes! The duel is way too short, but good, up until the end. The way Dooku escapes is so ridiculous, forcing Yoda to use the force to prevent the massive pillar from crushing Anakin and Obi-Wan's bodies. Narrow minded and uncreative. Why didn't Yoda force push their bodies out of the way, then go whoop Dooku some more? Why didn't Anakin or Obi-Wan just move? There were like 100 things wrong with that moment. The ending, just like nearly all the other scenes, was a letdown. There could have been so much more dynamic in all of the action scenes. The overall writing is just weak, and you know what, the set designs are weak too. You think that's one thing Lucas wouldn't mess up (the first 3 were so good in this area) but the sets lack proper detail. What a failure of a movie. Compared to the rest of the saga, this movie is a 3 outta 10, but I guess it deserves a 6.",0

Acting is fine, but terrible dialogue and awful development of the bonds between characters leaves much of the plot in ruins, ultimately making much of what happens questionable. Individual character development also proves unfit, with only McGregor's role seeming valuable and somehow still improperly used, a like to how the other leads are not given a chance to deliver a good performance based on how poor the writing is. There is some high stakes action, but much of it feels unreal for what has been set up for the characters previously. The plot certainly lacks direction and purpose, driving towards no real goal. Fortunately, a Williams score is wonderfully present and some visuals are actually pleasing, with a few awesome fight sequences. Still, the end of the feature leaves the audience without a real sense of achievement or loss, due to its lack of attention to any intriguing plays on emotional depth. There are a few truly interesting plot points, but not enough materializes in a way that moves the overarching story a significant amount within the course of the feature. Overall, this is barely a decent film, albeit in the Star Wars franchise.",0
973,6.0,"If Episode 1 was the one aimed at the children (Jar Jar Binks is as annoying as the damned Ewoks), this Episode 2 is the romantic one. I still don't make sense of this new trilogy. Now somebody tell me what percentage of this film is been dedicated to clarify things about Anakin Skywalker and the whole Star Wars universe? Not even 25% of it. The rest is just pyrotechnics, digital effects, and all the stuff that money and modern technology can provide. We could also discuss about the lack of a really charismatic character in these new films. There's no Han Solo around here, man! Hayden Christiansen is way too far from somebody destined to become Darth Vader. What the hell is Darth Vader doing running down the flowery hill chasing Natalie Portman??? Come on!",0

It looks animated. It looks fake. I'm not impressed by this crap. 2) Why do people write? If it doesn't matter what people say, why bother to write down things to say? 3) Why do people act? Is the point of acting to artistically portray human emotions and human life? If that's the case, does George Lucas know?

975,5.0,"SPOILERS After 1999, George Lucas must have been questioning his choices. Creating an awful prequel for his amazing original trilogy, Lucas had created a woeful script, some terrible characters and succeeded in nothing except making a bit of money through games and toys. In the second of his prequels therefore, Lucas must surely have had his mind on creating a better film with more substance. To a degree he has succeeded, and ""Attack of the Clones"" is a vast improvement on it's predecessor. Ultimately though, this film is still a weak product which fails to live up to the high standards fans of the series expect.",0
976,7.0,"After the dismal Phantom Menace, I thought once you hit rock bottom, you can only go up. And I was partially right. Just like The Phantom Menace, this film suffers from weak dialogue (especially in the romance sequences) rather flat acting (especially from Hayden Christensen - whose performance FYI will thankfully improve in Revenge of the Sith), and an over-reliance on CGI. However, the film is more in line with the Original Trilogy (i.e. we see primitive Star Destroyers and Storm Troopers), the music is better soley because of a beautifully constructed new theme by John Williams (Across The Stars - the Love Theme for Anakin and Padme). And the last 45 minutes is what we come to expect from Star Wars - the action-packed Battle of Geonosis. For that reason, I give this an above average rating - 7 out of 10.",0

979,7.0,"this film is under rated big time star wars attack of the clones 2hrs 22mins 7/10 set 22 yrs before the original star wars directed by George Lucas so ten yrs of his original meeting Anakin hides his romance from the republic as obi wan finds out about murder attempt on the senator and finds a clone army for the Jedi to protect the republic in a twist. as Anakin has grown he is becoming more powerful he is becoming a handful for obi wan his crossroad of his training and his meeting with a powerful figure leads to a choice so as obi wan goes looking. The story line is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan's search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great. And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee's performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in ""Phantom Menace"", but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.with Anakin and Yoda fighting to stop count dooku from changing Anakin as they found out who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover who has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Kamino, and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other, and he has nightmarish visions of his mother. They travel to his home planet .I have to say that I find this to be a really enjoyable movie. I tried not to like it when it first came out due to its name. Seriously, George Lucas...""Attack of the Clones""? I mean, I get it, but there were lots of options for a better name than that.

985,5.0,"STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES    spoilers((( George Lucas started making film history in the space wars in the 70ties, probably without knowing himself. He made three great movies and in 2000 he decided starting the whole thing from the real beginning; in episode 1! The Phantom Menace wasn't as good as many had expected, but now there were no way back. The second episode is this; with youngsters Hayden Christianssen and Ewan MacGregor in leading roles. The film contains mostly the same as the others- laser guns, laser swords, power, bad-guys and dark force, and tons of effects that is! The thing I fumbled at, was: in both this and Episode 1, units, plains, weapons and suits looks better and finer, then in Episode 4,5 and 6! Hmm, isn't that wrong? When this is old times?",0
986,,"First of all. In my mind. I don't have an idea of what the next Star Wars movie is supposed to be like. I don't create the movie in my mind and then get disappointed when it doesn't play out that way in the final version. That's one of the main problems with people critiquing these films. They all think they know how a Star Wars movies should be made. I go into these movies not knowing what to expect. I will give the negative critics a few things. Yes, the acting isn't the greatest. Especially Natalie Portman and Samual Jackson. I thought Hayden did an interesting job though. It was an odd performance if you ask me, but it worked. Ewan did a much better job then he did on Episode I. Christopher Lee was as good as always and Yoda rules, also. The computer effects get a little out of control some times. What I've noticed is how most negative reviews seem to only focus on the negative. As if there out to personally get George Lucas for not making the movie there way, but let me take you to the positive side with some questions.",0

These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are.

Other than that, I think the film (as part of a grand saga) is just laying the ground work with what's to come in Episode III and the classic trilogy.  Good work George!",1

But when Anakin went to rescue Obi-Wan and the Jedi Knights showed it was a free for all battle royal.  Then Yoda brought in the clones and the war began.  Clone vs. Battle Droid in an arena setting just plain cool.  Then when Yoda brought out his lightsaber and took on Count Dooku we saw how fast Yoda really could move.  He was jumping all over the place and attacking quicker than you could track with human eyes.  It was great to see little Yoda finally in action!,0

993,6.0,"Stuck between The Phantom Menace(99) and Revenge of the Sith(05), this one-sixth of the Star Wars saga may end up being the most forgettable of all. There are no scenes which seem to stand out and at least embed themselves in the memory. Phantom Menace may have been a bit slower going but at least you had the devil-like Darth Maul killing a Jedi Knight and the first glimpse of a planet-sized city. The climax here is still my favorite sequence of this film, with Chris Lee showing off his still-formidable chops, but this doesn't say much for the rest of the picture. Annakin Skywalker has grown up from a cute little boy of Phantom Menace into a pouting young man (Christensen), mentored, with difficulty, by Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor). The Jedi Knights (led by Yoda) deal with mysterious plots to create an army of clones, which are scheduled to fight some war for some reasons unknown. Annakin learns about loss, in a couple of different ways, and begins a slight turn towards the dark side, in the form of vengeance. It looks like Christensen was instructed to act younger than he is because that part does work out - he comes across as very immature. Meanwhile, the clone army wears the same stormtrooper white armor we all first saw in Star Wars(77 aka A New Hope), which means they were all clones...? Darth, where are you when we need yuh? The pic is naturally hampered by being the middle one in the 2nd (1st?) trilogy, with no real beginning or ending. All you can do is look forward to Darth Sidious doing his thing in the next installment.",1
994,7.0,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the second film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and is the fifth film in the overall Star Wars saga. To start Episode 2 is in my opinion the weakest out of all 6 of the Star Wars films, and the reasons for this thought are many. Although it's a well made film it just mainly lacks the energy and excitement of the other films in the saga, and most notably the original trilogy. Part of the reasons for this is the weak acting by almost every member of the cast(minus Ewan McGreggor), and the occasional flat dialogue. Still minus all of this, there is still lots to enjoy about this one. The special effects are all top notch and the action is good, and the new planets and environments are very imaginative. If only a few bugs were worked out in the screen writing process, and a little better acting from the performers, this one could of been on the level of the originals, but it falls short. The action is there, but it just lacks energy.",0
995,7.0,"I did not like this movie as much - to much action for me. Also, there was a stupid love story in the background. It's the same way with almost all action movies - they ruin them with gooey love stories. As it got to the middle of the movie, a lot of action appeared as the clone army was built, but the love story ruined it. I would recommend this to people that like action films. This has the most action of the Star Wars series so far, so if you are someone that likes action, then go ahead and watch it, but if you absolutely hate love stories like me, then I would not recommend this movie to you. In the end, this movie had plenty of action, so if you like action, go ahead and watch it. If you hate action and love, then I wouldn't recommend it to you.",1
996,8.0,"I'm not a HUGE fan of episodes 1 through 3. However, I AM a huge star wars fan so I took that into account when viewing this movie. The fact is it's a better movie than part 1, plain and simple. You get to see Anakin becoming a jedi and taking his first steps toward losing himself. You learn about an impatient side to him that will ultimately be his undoing. The movie itself focuses on Anakin's many relationships. That with his mother, with Padme, the Jedi Council, Obi-Wan and, of course, the man that would be Emperor Palpatine. For the importance of forwarding the plot, this movie was vitally important to the series. As a movie in general, I was not entirely impressed. I felt like Anakin was portrayed as way too immature for the man that would ultimately become Darth Vader. In episodes 4, 5 and 6, Darth Vader is ultimate Evil. Are we supposed to buy that ultimate evil was borne out of a whiney teenager? On second thought, maybe that IS the source of the ultimate evil in the universe.",0

998,3.0,"The only thing positive I can say about this film is that it is better than Phantom Menace. That is the only thing I can say that makes this movie remotely recommendable... That doesn't necessarily mean its a great film, let alone a good one. The film suffers from being too creatively controlled by George Lucas. The reason why Empire was good was that Lucas only wrote the script... And it had to be revised. It is his usual tension-free, bland dialogue script that gives the movie a minority of its problems. This was a classic example in the fool me once shame on him, fool me twice shame on me. The producers should have seen this coming and should not have given Lucas as much creative control as he did. Most of the plot devises he sets up crashes and burns. It is a catastrophe of epic proportions. The ""romance"" in this film between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman crumbles because of bland dialogue and implausible plot devises. ""I'm a senator"" Samuel L Jackson, Ewan McGreggor and Christopher Lee give decent performances. The problem is is that they are so detached with their environment. Like their only purpose was to take out a lightsaber each scene. But with Hayden Christensen... Good God what happened there? Some of the worst acting, no, worst line delivery I have seen in a while. Tommy Wiseau could give better line delivery than that man. But no, The script isn't the downfall of the film, nor is the acting. The use of CGI in every scene, literally every scene is what killed the film for me. The effects added zero tension zero thrills and had zero purpose. In the end, this film had to be the darkest of the trilogy because it was the second act, the characters needed a challenge they could overcome. The only purpose this film will ever have is that this is some minor details between Episode I and Episode III.",0

While a lot of the early reviews have panned the love story and the performances of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, I would tend  to disgree,, yea they arent as good as some of the elders, but they are ok and the romance (while perhaps taking up a bit oo much screen time) is properly handled as a kindof corny flirtation between two teenagers who are both somewhat full of themselves. While the film does have its flaws (some slow sections towards the middle, some shaky character animation) on the whole it work as part of the ""Star Wars"" epic and is an entertaining rollercoaster ride on its own. And if you are paying attention to all the undertones if what is really happening beneath the surface, its almost a greek tragedy. I do definitely reccomend the movie. GRADE: B+",1

Additionally, the plot is easier to follow this time around, with a story that focuses less on political squabbles and more on the Star Wars characters that we want to spend time with.

The excitement in this film was not as good as The Phantom Menace. They were many slow paced scenes particularly with the Anakin-Padme scenes . They were boring and stupid . The chemistry was very bad because both performances were awful. The romance has lack of passion. George should use more romantic elements in it both emotionally and passionately. When I thought Jake Llyod's acting was poor , I was hoping Hayden could do a better job but he was just as worst as him. While Natalie Portman's wooden acting is still there except improved .

'Attack Of The Clones' is undoubtedly the worst Star Wars film to date. JJ Abrams could film two chimps fighting with sticks and make a more entertaining film than AOTC. Jar Jar Binks may have a reduced role, but all of the other flaws and failures of Episode I are magnified in Episode II.

1025,5.0,"i give it only has a 5/10. Why? The acting is very wooden, and of course the CGI was terrible. But, I can only deduct 3 stars because of this. Why? First off, acting was NEVER the strong point of Star Wars (Remember Princess Leia in the first one, talking in a British accent in a few scenes? Jesus!). The cast here is assembled of good actors. With the exception of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDirmid and Christopher Lee(Who pull their roles off brilliantly), Hayden Chistensen and Natalie Portman overacted to actually make the horrible script sound good. They tried to hard - if you saw them in other films they did, I think you'd get a different perspective on their acting. But it was the writing. As for the computer effects, well it looks too cartoonish in many places. Even Yoda's sword fight didn't impress me. So, what was good about this movie? Well, you do see traces of Vader every now and then. You see the Clone Wars unfold and the 'plans' for the Death Star. I give Attack of the Clones 7/10 because it must be deliberately weak to pave way for Revenge of the Sith, which I am sure will be far more superior to this one. You could only wish that George Lucas would have had a plot line that would have accommodated the more superior special effects of the original trilogy. That's right - I do believe the effects from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are way better than these. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.",0

From the Speeder chase through the skies of Courisant, to the eye dazzling final battle scene this movie had my heart pounding just like when I was 7 and saw Star Wars - A New Hope for the very first time.  Episode Two didn't suffer from the CGI overload that plagued it's predecessor.  The visual effects are an integral part of the story line, and almost take on the power of a lead actor or actress on the screen, without bludgeoning the audience into numbness.  Ewan McGregor seems very comfortable in his role as Master Kenobi, and steals the movie with an outstanding performance.  Despite Lucas's vision of this being the story of the raise and fall of Anakin, it is much more interesting to see Obi-Wan as a young man.  If you haven't seen this one yet, I would highly recommend it.  If you have seen it already, let me know next time you are going, I will chip in gas money.",1
1027,,"LOTR it isn't. Lucas can't write dialog to save his life, and even with a script doctor AOTC comes off as so corny the audience is given to uncomfortable laughing and giggling. But about three quarters of the way through this awesome roller coaster romp the special effects suddenly get to you and you say, 'ok, this is enough, game over', because it's just too spectacular. There are scenes there where so much is happening, like a video game with real actors, except - except what they're doing here is industrial light years ahead of what anyone else can do.",0
1028,6.0,"I was almost as disappointed with Episode II, as I was with Episode VI. I only liked it slightly better, because the special effects were a lot cleaner--what would you expect with close to 20 years more computing power and 100 million, or so, more in budget (not inflation adjusted).",0
1029,,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a fine follow-up to the underrated ""Phantom Menace"".  But whereas that film was a very lightweight film, this sequel possesses more action, more humour and more darkness, with a little bit of romance thrown in for good measure.",0
1030,6.0,"For a long time this film was the unwanted relative of the Star Wars universe and for the first time I had a semblance of enjoyment. Young Anakin is older and unfortunately played by Hayden Christensen who was awful but balanced out by Ewan McGregor's sublime Obi Wan and Christopher Lee's Count Dooku. The republic come under attack from a clone army raising an alarm of the dark side rising and the potential return of the sith, with Anakin struggling with internal turmoil. Decent film with better writing and better acting in some parts could have propelled it higher.",0
1031,7.0,"This came out in my late high school years and I was so excited. I was looking forward to more movies in the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker saga. After being a bit disappointed with The Phantom Menace I hoped that there'd be a better movie. And you know what? I actually enjoyed this second film of the prequel trilogy. Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Ahmed Best, Samuel L. Jackson, and Frank Oz are all back, along with some new faces. We get to see more new worlds and see what events transpired for a certain war for the dying Republic. Sure, we could have more action and less of the talk scenes, and maybe there could be a more compelling plot, but this did it decently. The alien creatures in the movie really stole the show. They could definitely make Ray Harryhausen blush!",1
1032,5.0,"In my point of view the Attack of the Clones is the worst of the Star Wars series as a whole. To start Natalie Porman portraits Amidala, the mother of the heroes of the future rebellion Luke and Lya, as just a pretty chick ,which has, for some reason , at the end a crash for a annoying teenager ,which has no control of his emotions and has killed a village. I do not care if they killed his mother, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi OK to kill two to three persons in rage but then he should pull himself together ,not in sense do a small genocide!! Also the Jedis are even more useless the the Phantom Menance (if that is possible) and it takes them about 80% of the running time to act in effective manner. In the point they see a millions strong army just emerge almost out of thin air and the President of the Senate use them to take extra authority, due to the break up of the Galaxic Rebuplic.Why the can not think that something big is going on behind the scenes, if they can not read the mind of him( because he is the Leader of the Sith) or even the persons close to him? The battle at the end though nice to look at is clones against droids, in other worlds the soldiers in both sides are next to nothing to be as easy to replace as a pair of socks!! And the cgi is a pain to my eyes and seen it again ,brings me tears, because ,one the animated series The Clone Wars has better designs and is a TV series!! And second and most important Star Wars is at the every least lay the foundation of the Computer Generated Images (CGI) as a whole, with out its offer the effects may still look like as before Star Wars ,fake to the point of laugh.But my biggest complains are that this flick, first, is plain merchandise movie, made just to sell toys and action figures and not to tell a good story. Second and by far my biggest problem however is the man himself George Lucas ,who was director, lead producer and main financier of the movie. In other worlds ,he had total authority of the project and no one was in a position to stop him of put whatever he liked ,but not what was best for the project as a whole . If you have not seen it already and you hope to have a enjoyable experience, then you will be disappointed.",0
1033,,"A real arse-kicker. Loaded with action sequences, pretty much 80% of the movie is fighting or chasing. This is extrememly satsifying but a bit exhausting.

But the thing about Star Wars is that there is no way you can possibly hate the franchise no matter what it does. Even if there's one bad movie there's still a new hope (ba dm tss!), that probably the next movie does fix some stuff.

This just feels like a slog fest, all of Anakin's speeches just feel automated and with no emotion. The end fight(s) are boring. Most of this movie is just CGI, Phantom has a good character and costume design, the full CGI fights don't go on for a long time, this just feels boring and bland.",0
1039,,"George Lucas brought in co-writer Jonathan Hales to help him improve over his (Lucas') solo writing effort on 1999's 'The Phantom Menace'.  Even some of the cast of that 1999 film agreed recently that it was a pretty flat effort given the expectations of the 'Star Wars' legacy.  Perhaps it wasn't a bad thing that 'The Phantom Menace' was a little flat because you want the films to get better as you go along, don't you?  Well, 'Attack of the Clones' has a much better outcome because it is dark like 'The Empire Strikes Back' and Lucas is smart.  By making this film he realizes that the darker they get, the more fascinating they become for the mind set of the science fiction fan.  Many hard core 'Star Wars' fans consider 'The Empire Strikes Back' to be the best of ALL 'Star Wars' movies.  'Attack of the Clones' has the best look of ALL the 'Star Wars' films because of the progression of technology in the area of special effects.  I never expected the second coming with the release of these last two films in the last three years and with the upcoming final chapter in 2005..... but it will be interesting to see how Lucas will cap off the first three stories before we can look back on the last three made a generation ago but still, it has a reach to all generations, from ages 8 to 80.",0
1040,10.0,"If you were expecting high art what are you doing watching Star Wars? Any of them! They are all simple stories told to entertain. From the classic trilogy, through Tolkien to the Arthurian romances, they are simple tales of adventure. Why oh why do all these fans think their vision is better than George Lucas? Just sit back and enjoy a fun two hours of a story well told without the angst and complexity of so called mature dramas.",1
1041,6.0,"Though it's a worthy addition to the `Star Wars' series (there's lots of eye candy), the aura of gee-whiz and kid-like vigor that has come to be expected has been replaced with a grimness of purpose that drains most of the fun out of the experience; what's left is creator George Lucas' relentless intention of ramming a narrative down your throat. Almost completely devoid of humor, Lucas seems to have put his blinkers on: in between chase and battle sequences are long, dull stretches of exposition meant to `explain' Anakin Skywalker's descent into Darth Vader (as played by Hayden Christensen, he's both a teenage rebel and a budding fascist) as well as his blossoming romance with politician Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). For the most part, the action sequences, while elaborate and convincing, are overlong; the final section, the actual clone attack, has so much going on and to such lengthy extremes that you begin to get distracted and confused (although Yoda, as the field general, keeps telling you what's supposed to be going on). The acting itself, usually reliable if not spectacular, this time around seems to have a joylessness to it (Ewen McGregor appears to have phoned in his Obi-Wan Kenobi) that makes things seem drearier than they should, although Christensen does have a nice, startling moment when he describes the rage he felt avenging an important death. In the end, though, the visuals make the enterprise worth it, particularly a short, monochromatic fight scene in a driving rainstorm on top of a mushroom-shaped building--it's vastly different from anything in the entire color-drenched series and wonderfully memorable.",0
1042,2.0,Attack of the Clones was by far the best movie out made by George Lucas since ESB but this doesn't mean the movie itself is good.,1
1043,4.0,"Why does every character has to tell me what to see, think or feel almost on every scene? Did George Lucas though people wouldn't understand the plot? I mean, one of the main ideas of writing a script is ""show, don't tell"". Some times I can't believe how dumb these Jedi's seem to be. I thought they were one with the force... I remember loving the huge Jedi fight almost at the end, but now seems pointless and out of the blue. Oh, well. Surely plenty of fans will keep loving it. It's good if you're not really watching it and you just use it as background noise, that way you won't feel like you've lost two and a half hours of your time. Thank you Amazon Prime for that. Most of the action scenes still feel entertaining and maintain the tension, but you've got to endure for that. I miss George Lucas' obsession in making better cuts every certain time, because many times the CGI doesn't hold very well, some scenes have this video game texture and others you have the feeling the actors aren't in those scenarios. Flea jumping Yoda still makes me chuckle. A 00's kid classic.",1

I highlight the scenarios that are part of great moments such as the cyberpunk night of Coruscant and Obi Wan's visit to the planet Kamino. The exterior and interior virtual locations have been greatly improved. That said, despite the great battles in the film's last act, the scenes still feel like they're part of a video game.",1

1054,7.0,"Star Wars #2. Roger Ebert accused Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme of being the real clones. They speak in monotones. Ebert said they sound like lawyers. By now, character and spirited dialogue were taking a back seat to Lucas' fascination with computers. Lucas gave mixed signals as to how many stories he had. At different times, he reported 6, 9 and 12, as if he were trying to be conservative on one hand and losing control of the series on the other. The films ultimately became anti-climactic, playing second fiddle to advance publicity and merchandising. Mark Hamil may have been ugly, but he did have personality. Hayden Christensen has none. Christopher Lee brings some dignity to the film.",0

Yep, I'd say about 80% of the effects in this film were outstanding, and about 20% were so laughably fake-looking and absurd that it just drags down the whole ""believability"" factor.  Just when I start to believe ""I'm really there,"" something reminds me I'm looking at poor digital seaming.

1064,9.0,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a hugely entertaining sci-fi adventure that's definitely a lot more fun than THE PHANTOM MENACE. Anyone who doesn't like it doesn't know what it means to have fun. The movie ain't perfect, the performance from the guy who played Anakin is amateurish and his love scenes with Amidala are something you can only suffer through. All he has is good looks. I really hope he improves his acting before Episode III. But, everything else about this movie is spectatular! The action is amazing, mind-blowing, and so are the effects! It really doesn't show it was shot on digital video. The chase in Coruscant, the clone factory, and the final battle are really the most ambitious and amazing sequences I've ever seen in an action movie. I'm a big STAR WARS fan and I wasn't disappointed, unlike with THE PHANTOM MENACE. Go see it now!!!",1

Now George if your reading this somehow, listen carefully. Using your huge budget to create a film of this magnitude is very entertaining, and a treat for the eyes, but please retire as a director George. You can't direct pal. Maybe you can cyber direct on a computer, editing and cutting out pictures and scenes, but you cant get the most out of your actors,  the guys who directed the original trilogy did.",0

While the first movie was a bit slow and the humor was cheesy, this movie gave us bad special effects, a trite and down right rediculous script, and the worst acting(Hayden Christiansen) I have seen since Sofia Copala in The G.F. III. Having computer animated Storme Troopers and computer animated Yoda destroyed what made the Original movies likable. I understand that there are things that are just better with computer animation, but for God's sake, you don't need everything to be done on a computer. An apple on a string would have been less crappy. The movie stared to look like Space Jams after a while. I can't help but wonder if people have lost there collective minds when I see the average rating on this movie is 7.2. This movie is blasphemous to all that made the True Star Wars Trilogy Great. A 7.2 rating for this movie is an insult to movies that did not suck and received an equal or lower rating.

I think it is clear in casting Luke Skywalker's Father, they looked to the son's acting, Mark Hamill's acting as a guide. Nearly every word uttered by Skywalker Senior is more unbelievable as the next. However, the film has some great special fx, does a good job with the story, and if you're into costumes, Natalie Portman where's a lot of them in this flick. Watching Yoda in action, and I mean ACTION, is a wonderful. I suppose I should add, that every star wars fan should see this. I am, I did, and despite my obvious misgivings, I was glad I did.",0
1074,5.0,"Attack of the Clones had the unenviable distinction of being not so much the prequel to Star Wars but the sequel to the Phantom Menace. If movies were people this would be like finding out you were Hitler's nephew or worse, Charlton Heston's son. Menace achieved a lot, namely what many thought impossible; permanently sapping the lustre from what was an almost universally adored series. If the sparkle was to return to those stars this had to first class, grade A, top of the class stuff. Any reminder of its predecessor beyond the bare bones of plot continuity were therefore wise to avoid at all costs. Clones partially succeeds in restoring some pride to the series. Structually its better than its predecessor, the plot more straightforward and less marred by political spiel than before. However, this can't hide its wider failings. Just as before, none of the newer characters fail to make any impact. There's no Han Solo or Luke to offer us the simple pleasures of before. Padme no longer speaks with a lifeless monotone and could almost pass for a real human being. Binks, reviled by the entire universe has a greatly reduced role. Lucas puts two fingers up at those who maligned his 'comic' creation, i.e. everyone and ensures Jar Jar is central to a key plot point thus justifying his existence in the series. He'll claim it was planned that way all along of course but you don't need to be a Jedi to work out this is the cine-equivalent of the spoilt child who has to have the last word in an argument. It was still WRONG George, I don't care if the Gungan menace killed the Emperor himself. The central flaw in Clones is the relationship that should be its (and the series) emotional core, namely the relationship between Anakin and Padme. From the outset this is doomed on screen because of the casting of Hayden Christensen. His performance is so wooden and devoid of credibility that you might as well have hired the Gaffer's son and got him to read out the lines. We're asked to believe that this dull and stroppy teen will one day be the most feared man in the universe. So why does Padme fall in love with the little upstart? Lucas's script offers no clues. Anakin's diatribe on the failings of democracy should be enough to alarm any potential suteur but Padmes hardly bats an eyelid. She gets a another chance later after Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders but do any bulbs go off? Not a bit of it. Having proclaimed his murder of women and children the feckless former Monarch gives him a supportive hug! The problems of being attracted to a would-be fascist and murderer are offset, Lucas suggests, by the fact that Skywalker is good at rolling around in grass and making fruit float in the air, thus showcasing his playful qualities. We're left concluding that the most important couple in the galaxy came together because Padme is a sucker for a pretty face. Cynics may point to some evidence of misogyny here but in Lucas' defence this is the man who championed the role of women by putting Princess Leia in that slave girl two-piece. In any event Padme deserves everything she gets. Does the rest of the story fare any better? Sadly not. Obi Wan's journey to Kimino to visit a clone factory pushes story credibility to the limit. No one seems very alarmed by the prospect of entire army having being created in secret. Why should they you ask, the Jedi are in charge right? Wrong. Having being captured by Count Dooku the hapless Jedi is TOLD that Palpatine is the Emperor but dismisses it as dark side deception. Does no one think to check it out? Of course not and consequently only Yoda shows any common sense, only neglecting to mention his kidnap and replacement by a terrible puppet around the time of Menace. We're also treated to some moments of unintentional hilarity. Titter ye not at the Anakin blow job scene, and if you're watching toward the end try not to laugh when Yoda fights Dooku which looks like the Sith lord is trying to swat a giant fly. In contrast all the real jokes fail flat mostly, C3P0 the worst offender with some truly awful sub-Graham Norton punning that will make you wish you could disconnect your own head. Only Ewan McGregor in a more relaxed performance gets a good bit of deadpanning in with his caustic ""to get a drink"" response to Anakin's ""where are you going?"" question. So the romance is rushed and insubstantial - laced with some of the worst dialogue you'll hear in any language (""A litter piece of me dies each day"", yuk), and the Clone story fails to ignite due to lapses in plot logic and some flat delivery by the leads. On the plus side there are some nice set-pieces, though a little too cartoony is places, and a few crowd pleasing moments. All in all this is a better than before but not yet near the level set by the original trilogy. With only one film left to go there is a hell of a lot to be done (as well as a hell of lot of plot to get through) if this trilogy is to save face. Despite some attempts to improve, this is still the longest expositionary picture ever made. Skip it and watch the 2 minute scene in the original describing this period instead. Its over sooner and tells you all you need to know, namely very little.",0
1075,7.0,"I suppose it is because it gets too bogged down in politics and not enough action. Also Hayden Christensen is not likable. Couldn't they have found a more popular and seasoned actor to play Anakin Skywalker than him? I would like to think so. I know he is supposed to play a spoiled brat of sorts but I wanted to relate to his character one way or another, love or hate not simply indifference. I know he has some big shoes to fill literally so I tried to cut him a little slack but he just doesn't do anything for me I truly wish he did. On the other hand Ewan McGregor is good in his portrayal as Ben Kenobi he has the energy and the ability to make it work.

Still think it's a naff title but for the rest - thoroughly enjoyed it. Drawbacks - a couple of places looked too much like preparation for the computer game release, and I can't get past the whole Senator and whinghy Annie thing. Having said that, the love story was done as well as they could do it, I think. For me, best thing about the film was the underlying politics, who and what the Clones are - a surprise turn around there - wasn't expecting that. Also the Cloners themselves, very impressive.

1085,6.0,"While the first film was a disappointment at least it was a little fun. This film tries to be more serious in tone, but comes across as boring and dull. The first and last acts are a lot of fun and action packed, but the middle drags and feels longer than it actually is. McGregor, Jackson, Oz, Morrison, and Lee are the best performers in the film, the effects are good but feel more dated even compared to the first film. Christiansen is really disappointing as Anakin, sometimes he feels like he's doing a good job the rest, well let's just say he doesn't like sand. Portman feels like she's phoning it in but is still being professional about it. All in all the film is a lot like Episode I, it has its moments but overall underwhelming.",0

As soon as the lights went out and those memorable ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"" words came up on that big screen and the good ol' Star Wars music starts playing I felt a chill in my spine a chill of excitement!

Watched the Phantom Menance at the pictures and found it laughable and clumsy but thought hey as crap as it was, bar Darth Maul, let's give it a go and waited for AOTC. Oh dear, oh dear how can people who love film possibly defend this nonsense. The dialogue is as clunky as hell. Instead of trying to show us that Anakin still loves Amidala through acting and character development Lucas thinks 'Oh no, I haven't got time for that lets just get him to say it on the way up in the elevator.

Jar-Jar, the worst and most childish creature in Star Wars universe, has been put away, in favour of Windou, Yoda, and count Dokou (Mr. Lee ""strikes back"": after many years in which the greatest Dracula on screen seems ""fading"", he gives us two great performances, showing his master acting skills!)... The most impressive thing is the performance of Ewan McGregor: he seems to imitate the way of walking and talking of the elder Obi Wan, as played by Alec Guinness. When I heard that he was casted for this role, I was skeptic... But I'm ""Force""d to admit that Lucas had chosen wisely!!

If George Lucas was trying to make us feel sympathy with Anakin he failed miserably. While Luke may have been a bit whiny too he was never that bad. The end of the movie gets you all pumped up for the clone wars;which you don't get to see. Don't get me started on Anakin and Padme,they have next to no chemistry and I frankly could care less if they got together.

Ironic, tender, obedient, angry, thoughtful, compassionate, charming,energetic but still cool, he could easily assume every feeling and emotionate state.

Everything that I ever wanted in a Star Wars movie was in Episode 2.  I realize many critics and non-fans simply won't get this movie or completely misunderstand the ""love"" story, but that's okay by me.  Many people felt the same way about Empire Strikes Back.

""Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" is a visually story telling film in which the story is told through it's visual effects.The first three films in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy were more better because the story telling was told not just in it's effects but within the story itself.Director George Lucas takes an approach to telling the origin of Darth Vader who was once Anakin Skywalker.I have to admit that Episodes I-II are going downhill a bit but at the same time,keeps me entertained and amused.With ""Star Wars:Episode III"" being ready for principal photography in 2003 for a Summer,2005 release date,it woulds seem possible,hopefully to have the original ""Star Wars"" premiere on DVD.",0

In this one the fight scenes are better but the screenplay of Anakin is woeful. Lucas will have to do a good job on Episode III. Good luck MATTY boy",1
1106,10.0,A must see for all STAR WARS fans young and old. Even if you are 875 years old like Yoda !!!!!! The only part of the movie that dissapointed me was that I read the book first and the actual movie didn't start till about chapter 3 or 4 of the hardback edition of this movie. Christopher Lee was great as Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyrannus. I loved seeing Boba Fett as a kid. Plus the best scene in the whole movie was when Yoda uses a lightsaber. He is pretty good for being 875 and only 2 feet tall!! Plus really get to see how Anakin starts to become Vader! I can hardly wait till 2005 which is when people are saying episode 3 will be out!                    Long live the Force! P.S. If by chance George Lucas is reading this thanks for making these movies.,1
1107,6.0,"Don't get me wrong - this film is awesome. I was really blown away, especially by the closing battle sequence with Count Dooku. Possibly the best of all 5 so far but the continual onslaught of millions of CGI's at 0.5 past light speed are very hard to get to grips with at times. With the exception of light-sabre confrontations, the large battles scenes in the original 3 movies were alot more gripping. ",1

At first, I thought the love story in it would be a bit sappy, but I loved that bit too. Very well done acting and the special effects were the best I've ever seen, as Yoda looks as real as real can be with character and emotion, which brings him full of life.",1
1110,6.0,"The only really good movie in this series is ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The first movie was fun, but it didn't hold up for me when I saw it on video (this apparently doesn't apply to lots of people that saw it in the theater as kids). But the second movie was excellent (and did hold up). The teddy-bear movie was terrible, and episode 1 was really dull (although I kind of liked the character with the horns on his face). Anyway, I'd say this is not quite as good as the original Star Wars (episode 4, that is), although the acting is generally much better (and the production values incomparably so). It was good enough that I'll watch the last one, although it is a little depressing to think what this series could have been if they had maintained the quality of TESB...",1
1111,9.0,"Wow! ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" lives up to all of the hype and then some. This film improves on 1999's ""The Phantom Menace"" in the character and story department, though the acting is still a little flat. I was impressed with the performance of Hayden Christensen portraying Anakin Skywalker, we can see shades of the dark side in him. I was also pleased to see that Samuel L. Jackson was given more screen time, we still don't find out much about his character, Mace Windu, but it nice too see him have some significant screen time. This film explains more about the Star Wars  story than the last film did, the action in this film is phenomenal, there is a flying car chase which is breathtaking. The last 45 minutes of this film are the true standout, it is non stop action, the real highlight of the action and the film is when Yoda picks up a lightsaber and shows us why he is the Jedi master, it is truly awesome. I highly recommend this film, a trluy good movie and one that I hope will be remembered at the years end",1

1113,7.0,"Well, following up after the phantom menace and I can say that the movie is consistently as good. But whats not consistent is the dated cgi and effects, I understand that its older, but the movie ranges from looking incredible to be absolutely horrid to look at. The plot is actually quite good, I like how it flows and pieces together to form one huge scale battle at the end which is the real highlight of the movie. The only part of the plot I didn't enjoy was Anakins and Padmes romance, its just downright bad. Shockingly dreadful dialogue and some mediocre acting don't do the film Well. The characters also aren't developed too much, only Anakin really is, which is alright. But again the movie all comes down to the ending which is spectacular to watch. Unlike the new star wars movies this one gets how to do action and especially lights aber fights...literally the most important part of star wars. Which is why I give 7/10 the film knows what it should be and it executes it pretty well.",1

1115,5.0,"The Phantom Menace was a disappointment, but still not bad. This would be terrible if there weren't some nice moments. First let me tell you about those. Ewan McGregor is even better now and also kinda sounds like Alec Guiness. That chase at the beginning was awesome, the part on that rainy planet even better, the meteorite scene similar to the one in The Empire Strikes Back, and some fights at the end would be great if the CGI wasn't so obvious in some parts. And also, while many people didn't like this new CGI Yoda, I really liked him and he's so cool, especially in that duel scene at the end. The first half of the movie is really slow and while the Obi-Wan part is good, the one with Anakin and Padme was awful. The part on Tatooine was okay and that is probably the only part of the movie where Hayden Christensen was decent. The dialogues are embarrassing in some scenes (I don't like sand) and someone should've told Lucas that he isn't writing a Shakespearian play! It's just so cringeworthy my face turned red. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so fake and forced and so awfully done it made me lose faith in George Lucas. But he's the reason this franchise exists so I forgive him. The second half is a little bit faster, but my interest was already lost and I didn't even follow most of it. At least Jar Jar was only there for a few minutes. So, if there wasn't for some good action scenes this movie would suck. It's actually solid this way, but remains the worst movie in the franchise.",0

1117,10.0,"What can be said about this movie that has not already been uttered? I will try my best.   Once again, as with The Phantom Menace, the critics are fairly divided.  This time, however, the fans seem pleased.  I, myself, enjoyed phantom very much.  Still, ATOC is more like the original films than phantom was.  The acting is overal good.  Hayden (Anakin) does a fine job, especially in the scene with Padme after the Tuskin slaughter.  Portman is OK.  She is a little too reserved for my taste, but that is what the character is like.  The real star of the movie is Yoda.  He simply steals the show at the end.  It is so remarkable that Yoda is all CG.  No critic seems to acknowledge this accomplishment.  The story is very complelling. I love how Lucas adds the sleuth element to film, a first for SW.  Visaully, Lucas proves once again that he is still the Master.  The images in every frame are potent enough to tell the story without dialog.  Perhaps that is why some dislike this film?  Once again, we see various elements that influenced Lucas cascading across the screen such as Dex's Diner and so forth.  Also, the design are remarably familar.  This allows the foreign worlds such as Corusant to have relevance to us.  In the end, Lucas has created a great old style sci fi flick with state of the art design and technology.  As a side note, I am really sick and tired of the comparisons to Lord of the rings and Peter Jackson.  Fellowship was great, but remember unlike Lucas, Jackson takes no creative risk in LOTR.  Jackson has one of the greatest stories to work with.  The environments and much of the dialog are already laid out.  Lucas has to do ALL OF IT!!",1

The Jedi have the task to decipher the plot that the Sith is planning against the republic. The politics grows as the Republic is no more completely democratic as it seems outwardly. <br /><br />The fighting sequences are good with few breathtaking moments like the fight of Dooku with the two Jedi leading to Anakin losing his hand; entry of Master Yoda was also interesting.

How is it possible that Queen/Senator Padme Amidala, who was about eight (8) years older then Anakin Skywalker in Episode I all of the sudden be the same age in Episode II?

Go back and watch the original and tell me you can't see the Anakin we got to know in EpII behind the black mask.  Especially at the climax of ROTJ.  People killed the Anakin in EPI because ""the dark lord would never say yippee"".  People he's 8. Back to EPII.  As a film, no its not great.  Only ANH can be classified a great film.  Hayden did a great job, and acted like any other 20 year old when faced against authority.  Natalie Portman was a little off, but maybe her role called for her to be restrained as she is a politician as well as a former Queen.  Ewan was by far the best and you can totally see him as the older gentleman we meet in ANH.  I've noticed that the rating for this film has actually gone up over the last month.  It was also named best film of the summer on another site.  I think people are realizing it for what it is. Just a small chapter in a much larger book that is the creation of George Lucas and therefore they have learned to enjoy it. I have been a SW fan for most of my life and I can't help but feel like a kid again when I watch all 5 movies.

Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is needed for a crucial vote and is being protected by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Jedi-in-training Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen).

1125,6.0,"Just saw STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES today in a special screening here in Zurich, Switzerland. First of all I think that STAR WARS is the best ""movie"" and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the best ""Star Wars-movie"" of the series. I also liked RETURN OF THE JEDI, although I (as everybody else) hated the Ewoks. I was dying to see THE PHANTOM MENACE and I even went to the US to see it on its second day of release. The waiting for the film was much better than the end-product itself. Although I kept defending TPM (great pod-race, suberb lightsaber duel, effects in general) I never thought of it as a good film and I truly hoped that George Lucas and his crew will somehow find a way to deliver a better film (story-, acting, humorwise). Now after seeing AOTC I am almost fully satisfied. The actors (especially Ewan McGregor) were more relaxed this time around, the dialogue was way better and even the love story worked for me (on a Star Wars level that is...). But I am not 100% satisfied though - and this never happened before, for my taste - with the Special effects. Some shots looked like matte shots of the eighties. But all in all I think that this is one of the top three Star Wars Films and I look forward to seeing AOTC a second time, seeing it on DVD (again and again) and seeing EPISODE III in May 2005. Another 3 years to wait, damn I'm getting older.",1

I thought the story line was awesome, and it totally set it up for the next one to be the best one of all. I have to admit, the dialog needed a little help.  Lucas is definitely an action writer, not a love story writer.  Some of his lines were just a little bit sappy (note the sarcasm- you're in my very soul!) However, the movie still rocked, despite the occasional overly corny joke (oh this is such a drag...). I especially admire the way Lucas continues to make quality films that don't require a high rating.  NO sex no swearing no crude language or scenes, yet it's still an awesome movie.  This is truly a rare find in this day and age, I don't think many would argue with that.",1

There are numerous cliche-scenes, old-fashioned costumes, and the directing overall was conventional.  But of course, that's why we go and see a Star Wars movie.  Lucas definitely did not let us down.  Anybody who wants 2 C art should look further.  All the references to other classic scifi-movies are great.  To name a few: Blade Runner (noir feel of the dark side, rain, robots who want to live, air traffic), Metropolis (dehumanised workers, air traffic), Matrix (computercontrolled breeding of human beings), Robocop (Jango Fett), Starship Troopers (massive action scenes), Gladiator (arena fights), LOTR1 (fantasy politics, good vs evil forces) and basically most movies based on stories by Philip K.

There are a few in the ""Star Wars Universe"" that have had memorable performances.  For example...Ian McDiarmid, Harrison Ford, and Ewan McGregor.

In this film I was left with waiting for the next great special effect.  Even when people were talking, I found myself looking at the great effects going on around them.  I don't know maybe its just me, but the thing that has made star trek last throughout the years for me is not the special effects, but the interesting characters and the human situations they find themselves in, developed by a great script.

1139,7.0,Star Wars: episode 2 - Attack of the Clones is set ten years after the the events of the Phantom Menace the Republic continues to be mired in strife and chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. Unfortunately this has to be the worst prequel movie. For some reason the lightsaber fights got tune down they are so bad to watch and the story wasn't as engaging as the Phantom Menace. The movie does have incredible CGI for it's time and Beautiful shots as always. The musical score is on point one of the best things of the movie. Ewan McGregor does a way better job playing Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hayden Christensen plays the older Anakin and unfortunately his acting is kinda bad in this movie especially when they are at Tatooine. Natalie Portman does a perfect job playing Padmé she bring a lot of initiative to her character. The best performance of the movie has to go to Christopher Lee as the menacing Count Dooku. Frank Oz as always is amazing as Yoda. And I have to give credit to Temuera Morrison as he plays a badass bounty hunter but he also plays every clone in the movie!

Well, after leaving a boring birthday party early and going to see it at Showcase Cinemas in Revere, MA at 7:15 p.m. on Sunday, May 19, 2002, my final evaluation of the movie, out of 4 stars, is 3-3.5 stars. Overall, the movie is a well-crafted, intelligent, and worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. I think it falls somewhat short of the IV-VI first trilogy (but then the initial trilogy is beyond emulation anyway), but, as others have noted, it is better than ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"". Even in its own right, as a movie disconnected from the series progression, ""Attack..."" acquits itself well.",1
1144,,"I breathed a sigh of relief after seeing Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones. George Lucas has made up for the sins of his past, redeeming himself for subjecting viewers to the awful Episode I: The Phantom Menace, a movie so bad I thought it might sink the whole Star Wars franchise. The latest instalment, I'm happy to say, is a marked improvement. It's not perfect, but at least Jar Jar Binks is kept to a minimum, and Yoda's transformation into a butt-kicking action hero is worth the price of admission alone. Torontonian Hayden Christensen is convincing as Anakin Skywalker, although falls a little flat in the love scenes with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Those scenes seem to be trying to emulate a 1930s mannered romance style of acting, but it doesn't really work here because there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between the two actors. The love story isn't the draw here anyway. Star Wars fans want elaborately staged action sequences, and in Episode II Lucas delivers. Early on there is an exciting chase through the night time skies of Coruscant, and the film's last 45 minutes have the kind of exhilaration and showmanship associated with the best moments from the original trilogy.",0

In other words just because you CAN do a thing, doesn't mean you necessarily SHOULD do it. Allow me to digress: Spielberg's ""A.I."" was a good example. By Spielberg's own admission, had he found a way to make the shark work, he would have used it more in ""Jaws"". Instead of the classic atmospheric and suspensful film ""Jaws"" is, it would have been closer to a B-movie. Sometimes your limitations FORCE you te be creative.

While I hoped that George Lucas might push the reset button and go back to telling a story about characters we cared about, my hopes were dashed when Star Wars Attack of the Clones. There have been several attempts on Amidalla's (Natalie Portman) life. The attacks continue when she returns to Corsuscant to meet two old friends: Ben Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianssen). They go after one attempted assassin who turns out to be Jango Fett, the father of Boba. Curious, Ben Kenobi does an investigation that leads him to a distant world in which an alien race has created an army of clones under the direction and dealing of a former Jedi, Dooku. This way, the Empire can now have a standing army. The template is based on Jango Fett (so I guess he was a lousy shot with a blaster?). Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme go to her home world of Naboo and start to fall in love. Anakin starts to resent the Jedi order as he feels Kenobi is not treating him well. He returns to Tatooine to visit his mother. She has been kidnapped by the Tusken Raiders and Anakin finds her just as she dies. He goes berserk. Returning to Padme, he confides in her and their loves grows. They decide to find Ben Kenobi on the planet of Geonosis, home world of the Trade Federation. Through a series of events, all three survive a battle droid factory, are put in an arena with large, mean alien animals, and join a large Jedi battle against the Trade Federation. Joining them are the new clone troops. This eventually leads to Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) where Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda all do their best with their Light Sabers, but come up short. My first gripe was the pacing of the plot: slow. Moreover, the exposition usually resides in people sitting and talking to let the audience know its plot points. My second gripe was the acting coupled with the worst dialog since Captain Kirk's monologues in the TV version of Star Trek. In fact, Christianssen's lame acting rivals that of Shatner, although the latter was usually tongue-in-cheek about it. There is absolutely no chemistry between Anakin and Padme. Again, we have epic characters who don't care, because the actors do not care. It boils down again to Lucas who cares more about sets and special effects instead of telling a story. As a matter of fact, I found this one the most boring of the entire franchise. I struggled in staying awake at a point in this movie. Even worse, I felt like leaving at one point, but stayed thinking ""This might get better."" I was wrong. At least the light saber battle in Phantom Menace provided a little bit of entertainment because it was truly different and innovative. This was Lucas at his worst.",0

Ewan McGregor is fun to watch as Obi-Wan Kenobi! Anakin and Padme's love story is better than Twilight!

1169,,"Overall, I enjoyed Episode II but if the whole series of six films is to gel, then Episode III must be better. In my opinion, episodes 1, 2, 4 and 5 (forgetting Return of The Jedi for a moment), each get better than the one before. Therefore, the first is pretty average; the second much better; the fourth (the 'original') better still; and the fifth (Empire) the best, in my opinion. Then it deteriorates with 'Jedi', but only back to the standard of 'Clones', which is very good. The main flaw in this new episode is that the film is just too long. Twenty minutes shaved off could have tightened it up a heck of a lot, but it does drag in the middle. I agree with a lot of reviewers that the love affair between Annakin and Padme are drawn out. The thing that saves it is the haunting music of John Williams, which I feel is his best in the series. But I have heard it said that when you start to really listen to a film's score whilst watching the movie, your attention is waning. That aside, the majority of the movie is good fun. At last, I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance. He is the mainstay of this in a similar, but not as superb, way that Harrison Ford was in the earlier movies. Unlike others, I didn't actually like Christopher Lee in this. It follows too hot on the heels of his part in the 'Rings' film. The flaws are outweighed by some great action and inventive set-pieces. And C3PO is very funny. I'm glad he turned up when he did. And finally, in the face of some terrible dialogue, Natalie Portman is shaping up to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Hard to believe that someone so plain as Princess Leia could be produced by her! 7 out of 10. Episode 3 needs to be even better to justify three prequels.",1
1170,8.0,"I went to this film not believing that It would be much better than Episode I, MAN! was I in for a PLEASENT SURPRISE! this film rocked. I  always felt like Episode I felt more like a spin-off film rather than A true Star Wars film, NOT TRUE with Episode II. now this IS Star Wars. It did remind me of ""The 5th Element"" toward the begining of the film during the Skycar chase sceen. And this film did slow down into two halves, the OBI-WON half which is a detective(who dunnit) story line--and the other half of this film is the Anikin half wich is a slow sweeping love story. The Actor playing Anikin is perfect for his role. George Lucas redeemed both himself and the Star Wars franchise with this film. My only complaint is that the tital ""Attack of the Clones"" is mis-leading because the clones are the good guys helping the Jedi to fight a Droid Army. I thing a better tital would have been ""Jedi Master Yoda Kicks Ass""--because that was one of the highlights of this film for me(everyone in the movie theater busted out laughing and at the same time cheering during Yoda's fight scene-it was great!).I will probably see this film at leat 2 more times while it is still showing at the theater, and now I thinking of watching Episode I  all over again. My only other disapointment was that I had read some internet rumors that Jedi Master Jourus C'boath, and Grand Admiral Thrawn(from the Timothy Zahn novels)were going to have a small bit-parts in this film,and they didn't..... but thats okay--this is the Star Wars film we've all been waiting for since 1983.

Everything about the movie that is at least semi-good has an asterisk next to it. The final lightsaber duel with yoda vs dooku is cool in theory, but Dooku is super out of place and Yoda's character is blatantly Assasinated. Yoda works best when he is A wise, peaceful sage dedicated to peace. We should never hear Yoda say ""concentrate your fire on the nearest starship"" that completely ruins Yoda in episode 5 and 6 when you realize that he commanded an army in a war, he no longer stays as a passive, peaceful sage, he's more like a Knight than a teacher, and that is HORRIBLE. Another problem with this movie is the plot. THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE. Okay, lemme run through the overall plot of the movie. So the title crawl tells us that the Jedi are ""overwhelmed"" by the separatists. How? There is no mention of battle droid attacks, it's literally just a group with separate political views. So, palpatine wants to make an army so he can control 2 armies from behind the scenes, but Padmè is here and she wants to vote against making an army, so he has to kill her. But he doesn't want to do it himself, so he asks Dooku to do it. But Dooku doesn't want to do it, so he asks Jango fett to do it. But Jango doesn't want to do it, so he asks his friend to do it, but his friend doesn't want to do it so she sends a droid to do it, and if you really wanna get Granial about it, THE DROID SENDS BUGS TO GO KILL PADME. ""Secretly genius these movies are"" yeah right. Even Obi-wan, my favorite Star Wars character, is a complete idiot in this movie. He goes to Kamino and finds out that all the clones are made from Jango Fett's DNA, and later, he finds out that Dooku and Jango are friends. So, rationally, Obi-wan would be able to figure out a connection between Dooku and the army right, possibly finding out this is a trick and maybe saving the WHOLE GALAXY.

1179,,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones' can best be described as a transitional film in which we are right in the middle of the ultimate conversion from good to evil. Hayden Christensen is not miscast as the hormone infused Anakin Skywalker who treads on love with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Episode II' seems to improve upon the needed improvements that were so pervasive in Episode I'.      That being said, it still has its' flaws. Director George Lucas embeds his film with digital imagery that exhausts the viewer. I have comes to term with this trait that I only experience when watching these Star Wars' films (Episode I & 2) and have keenly labeled the concept Visual Exhaustion'. This is because Lucas puts 95% of the film through a digital filter. To some this can be an alluring trait, but in my personal opinion it seems as if he has come to rely wholeheartedly on digital imagery to convey a story. This was the severe case that we encountered upon Episode I. The hype surrounding that film was maniacal and had many people; including myself, disappointed with the first foray into the Galactic Tale that we had so eagerly awaited. Yet, in Episode II, we see Lucas actually focusing on telling a story and although the story might not as be as interesting as the later chapters are (Episode 4, 5, 6) we still are captivated by the young Hayden Christensen. This virtually unknown actor inhibits several characteristics that will lead into the third part which I will be anxiously awaiting. I must admit, I was severely turned off by Episode I' and wanted to loathe this film, but Lucas seems to have revamped the franchise and has focused on telling a story and not selling toys. Good move George, you have partially restored some integrity back into the franchise.      Improvements are seen in the overall design of the film. The plot involves some more origins being uncovered as an assassination attempt on Senator Amidala leads to a civil war in the galaxy as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) attempts at destroying the Galaxy through a separatist movement. This in turn forces the Senate to develop an army in order to ensure safety as there are not enough Jedi for thorough protection. The clones in question are the Storm Troopers we see in future films under the Direct Command of Lord Vader.      Confused yet? You should be. I always thought Lucas complicated his scripts by tackling too much content as back story and there is no difference here. Trade Wars, Colonies and Separatists are all part of this plot that leads into one pivotal event  the conversion of young Skywalker to the dark side. What I found interesting was the manner in which the film cleverly foreshadowed the events to come surrounding young Skywalker. Perhaps foreshadowing is not the best word to use since we all know of Skywalker's fate, but during the film we see clever scenarios that display the innate rage, madness and anger this young Jedi possesses. Skywalker's progress as a young man is a crucial element in this film as we are exposed to his much darker side that really spotlights him as a trouble-maker. Skywalker is slowly becoming disenchanted with the Rules a Jedi must follow and finds himself falling out of favor with his Masters. This in turn leads to a slow, yet gradual progression towards the Dark Side. It must be noted that Episode II is far superior to Episode I. As aforementioned, it does have its' flaws specifically in terms of dialogue. Yet it is also clear that Lucas had the script somewhat doctored for cohesiveness; something that was missing in Episode I. Writer Jonathan Hales (The Scorpion King) was called upon to clear some points but the dialogue still suffers as we are in for some of the weakest romantic dialogue in a long time. The interplay between Skywalker and Amidala is gushing with uncomforting romance as these two characters plot out their love and their lives.      Lucas opens the film with a great action sequence involving the pursuit of an assassin which is extremely entertaining. The sets in the introductory sequence seem to be lifted from Spielberg's A.I.' as the dizzying lights and glamour of a Galactic city come to life. This interesting action sequence seemingly sets the tone for what is a visually exhausting yet solid attempt at getting the franchise in the direction which it should be headed. Lucas uses the same transitional progression as he did with the later chapters in terms of pace and character development. Episode II' serves to hopefully build towards a cataclysmic and dark third piece that resolves all. Yet, the stereotypical Alien characters are back in full force and the pounding score from musical genius John Williams accompanies this tale that is a step ahead from Episode I,  but a few steps back from the magic that was Star Wars'.",1

1184,,"Attack Of The Clones continues the story from 1999's THE PHANTOM MENACE-Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan Mcgregor) is now a Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) is his Padawan, and Queen Amidalia(Natalie Portman) has decided to take Palpatine's place as the Senator from her home planet. However, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine(Ian Mcdiarmid), AKA ""Darth Sidious"" is up to no good, and is playing both sides in a galactic conflict between his Republic and the ""Seperatists"", led by Count Dooku(Christopher Lee) who is secretly working for Palpatine to start a war-the Clone Wars mentioned briefly in the original STAR WARS. AOTC attempts to address many of PHANTOM's flaws. There's less Jar-Jar, the henchman this time have a lot more to do and say, there's no scatological humor and the film is a lot more darker in tone. The film is also more visually and thematically linked to the original trilogy. However, there are still flaws. The two leads-Hayden and Natalie-give cringeworthy performances, and the love dialogue they're given to say doesn't help.(This is perhaps more Lucas's fault than theirs-both stars have been good actors in other films). Ewan Mcgregor, as Obi-Wan, tries to do his best but he's mainly stuck with bad wisecracks and exposition dialogue. The best performances come from returning old trilogy actors-Daniels(C-3PO) Oz(Yoda) and Mcdiarmid(Palpatine) as well as Christopher Lee(Who also plays a slightly similar villain in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy) and Temura Morrison, who plays the ""father"" of the Stormtrooopers and Boba Fett. The direction is OK-Lucas's transitions and edits are a little better here than in TPM, but still are very sloppy, especially in the film's final battle sequences, which fail to capture the suspense of the similar ground battle in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The special FX range from excellent to poor...particuarly with the Clonetroopers, who look excellent when we see one or two, but are obviously cut-and-pasted in assembly shots in the middle and end of the film. Overall, it's a passable ""Star Wars"" film, but still could have been a lot better.",1
1185,6.0,"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones gets the big 6 for me. While this movie was not good enough to be put up on the throne of excellence with the original Star Wars, I put this as a good popcorn flick. We have a good story but this film results in hits and misses. Big hits include Jengo Fett, Boba was my favorite character from the original trilogy and Jengo was a nice return to the Fett character, the battle with Mace Windu in the Colosseum, the battle with Yoda and Dooku... for a little guy that jedi could move, and the speed racer race between Anakin and Obi to find the evil female assassin through the city. Now here are the misses. I hated the love sequences between Padme and Anakin I nearly fell asleep, not enough Jengo Fett, not enough Mace Windu and his cool lightsabre, and it seems George Lucas wants to bore us to tears to enjoy this film. Sure he made a better movie than Phantom Menace but that's not saying much.I don't get why we don't see Dooku till the end. I liked the performance made by Christopher Lee as Dooku, only wishing there was more of him. With Star Wars- Attack of The Clones, you have to tell yourself that this is of the new trilogy. Chances are you would want to stick to the originals for real entertainment and watch this when you want to kill time.",0

1189,7.0,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is widely considered the most dramatic film of the Star Wars Prequel films because of the love affair between two of the movie's main protagonists, Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) and Padme Amidala (played very well by American actress and Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman). Lucky for the film, it has aged very well in time and has garnered a place of great love & respect in Star Wars fan's hearts & in movie fans in general because of the cheesy lines that writer/director George Lucas laid down in the second film of the prequels like when Anakin & Padme are alone on Padme's home planet of Naboo and Anakin goes off on a tangent about how he doesn't like sand because it is corse and irritating. He may have been trying to hit on Padme at the time but how many times do guys go with the sand route instead of complimenting the girl and go in for the kiss if the signals look right? In any case it's lines like that that have endeared this movie to Star Wars fans over the years plus the age of the film has helped!! Let's face it, it's now been 21 years since this film first hit the silver screen and a whole generation grew up on this film and they are attached to it for this reason. Plus Yoda fights in it with his green light saber & we only get to see that in only one other film in the Star Wars saga. Overall a very good film with fair acting by Canadian acting star Christensen who plays Anakin, very good acting by both Portman & McGregor in the other leads as Padme Amidala and Anakin's teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi respectively, outstanding costuming, outstanding special effects, outstanding sound editing, outstanding soundtrack by genius & legendary composer John Williams, and great writing and directing by legendary writer and director George Lucas. 7 out of 10 stars!!",1

This movie is the total destruction of the myth that Star Wars once was.... It seems to me George Lucas was trying to make a movie for people under the age of 15, which don't have any idea of the original star wars movies. The real fans can't be satisfied cause there are not enough of them to make the real big money. Episode One was bad, but this movie is even worse. It is just a normal love story accompanied by a few battles, where only lightsabres remind you of Star Wars. Oh yes, and special effects, lots of them, special effects where anyone could live without them... why do there have to be so many (not very good) rendered animals, so many landscapes generated by computers? What about just a bit of the old Star Wars style? The old masks looked far better than most of the rendered people in this movie.... This is NOT Star Wars anymore, this is crap. Where are the characters like Lando or Han? Why is this Jar Jar creature still alive? George Lucas destroyed the world he created with his own mind... I just hope he will rebuild it in Episode 3",0

1197,1.0,"'Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones' is a really silly movie. Since there is no interesting story, Lucas spends so much time on silly car chases and light saber battles. Its basically like watching a blank screen for two hours. The dialog is laughably bad, and I've seen better acting on soap operas. I'm not kidding. The characters may be the same from the originals, but they do not bring the passion or excitement they once did. Yoda is now just a computer-generated graphic. The mysteriousness of Darth Vader has now been destroyed too, thanks to bad acting by a child and a teenager. And thanks to some pitiful dialog and clumsy storytelling. The ""plot"" is about assassinations attempts on Queen Amidila, who spends the entire movie looking pretty and saying cornball dialog. After some political babble about the Republic, which really doesn't go anywhere, Obi-won-Konobi goes out on a hunt to find who is behind the scheme. He finds out it was Jango Fett, father of Boba Fett. Then he finds out a planet is making a army of clones. On the other side of the story, Annakin and Amidila are falling in love. Annakin then tries to find his mother. His mother is killed and he then kills an entire village of people. He is slowly going into the ""dark"" side. I would have cared if the acting wasn't so bad and the screenplay wasn't so wooden. There is no heart in the story. It looked like it was put together without any effort or passion. It is slightly better than 'Episode I', but nowhere near as good as the originals. I fear these three movie will destroy the legend of one of the most famous villains in screen history...If it hasn't done that already.",0

1201,7.0,"This movie is MUCH better than the first episode.  Here are some pros and a few cons with this movie: PROS: 1. Jar Jar Binks gets VERY LITTLE screen time this time.  That is GOOD.  I think Mr. Lucas did listen to all the comments he got from viewers of EP1, and toned him down A LOT.  Makes the movie SO much better. 2. Yoda was AWESOME.  I loved the computer effects.  I loved the fact that he kicked some MAJOR ass.  I also liked his calming force in the movie.  He is clearly the most powerful Jedi on the council.  This was even apparent in EP1, and it really shows this time. 3. The Visuals were truly AWESOME.  The different places that the movie took us to were just stunning.  The different creatures that were put in were very cool too. 4. This is of course expected, but the special effects were just great.  The computer effects were outstanding.  I really liked the race in the city. That was cool. 5. There was NO mention of ""mediclorians.""  Another big plus.  Seems Mr. Lucas heard the fans on that one too. 6. This makes EP1 quite a bit more understandable.  This movie also answered several of my questions from the first three films (parts 4, 5, and 6). 7. Natalie Portman is just stunning.  She was kind of reserved and held back a bit in EP1.  But, for this movie, she is powerful and well used.  And she is just such a BABE.",1

But the problem is, is it's not a good Star Wars movie. From the opening scene where the senator and her bodyguard are getting off the ship and he says something like 'Looks like we're out of danger' and then the bombs go off is just bad writing. Why telegraph the scene like that? The original Star Wars movies had nuance, feeling, and most of all a sense of foreboding and darkness that is almost completely gone in the first two installments (I and II) It seems Lucas is relying so heavily on comic relief and levity (Jar Jar, The flying thing that owns Anakin and his mom, and a host of other characters) that the feeling is lost. You really dont get a sense that this brat is going to be one of the most feared villians in movie history one day! Christianson, as Ani, is stiff and delivers his lines like he is reading off of cue cards. There really is no spark between he and Amidala, and the love scenes really gum up the works slowing the movie down when it should be gaining speed. The best scenes are those with obi wan (Mcgregor) and Jango Fett. They both have acting chops and have a fun duel. It was nice to see the beginnings of Boba Fett, a fan favorite. Once again, Lucas feels that the CGI characters are the wave of the future. Well, they may be, but until they flesh them out better they still look fake! In ROTJ, Jabba looked great because he was actually there! It was a puppet and looked great! As did the rest of the characters. Sam Jackson is good but his lines are so clunky its almost embarrasing. Some fun action scenes but most are catered to the kids in the audience, which wouldnt be so bad if there werent many adults who love the movies also!

But despite a defective plot, clunky dialogue and visual effects light-years behind the new series of films, back in 1977 it was fresh and astonishing, far more so than Episodes I and II. Now everyone knows what is possible with CGI and expects to see dazzling visual effects. And Episode II delivers. Alas, the pedestrian plot and banal dialogue are not enough to lift the film above the flashiness of the visual effects. In fact, the effects are SO dazzling that they seem cartoonish: Everything is so fast-paced and so much is happening on the screen at once that it is difficult to appreciate the spectacle. The gladiatorial sequence near the end is a triumph of special effects, but they are too reminiscent of the recent film `Gladiator'.

His ""Count Dooku"" role was misconceived and seemed designed solely for the purpose of including a well-respected, Alec Guinness-like British star. Even more disturbing, despite the urgings of fans far more devoted than I, Lucas still hasn't transferred the directorial and screenwriting reins to more capable professionals (as he had the one-time good sense to do in Empire Strikes Back) and concentrate on what he knows: storywriting and props. So we're stuck with another messy, thrown-together flick whose sole purpose is to inflate its creator's already enormous bank account.",0
1240,,"Over a decade (or, in our time, three years) has passed since the events seen in ""Phantom Menace."" A militant separatist movement, composed of thousands of star systems, threatens to secede from the Republic.  Led by the enigmatic former Jedi, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the separatist military forces vastly outnumber the declined ranks of Jedi Knights, most of which are spread throughout the galaxy. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly the queen of Naboo, returns to the galactic capital of Coruscant in order to cast her vote on whether or not to assist the overwhelmed Jedi by creating an Army of the Republic, which she believes will only serve as a catalyst for war. After narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, Padme is reunited with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who are assigned to protect her.",1

1242,7.0,"Following my viewing of The Phantom Menace in 1999, I eagerly waited for the next installment of George Lucas's epic sci-fi series, Star Wars to be unleashed upon the world and in November of 2001, I got my first taste of what that would be when I saw a teaser trailer for the newest Star Wars film called Attack of The Clones and my excitement level went through the roof. With every new trailer that dropped over the next few months, my eagerness to see the movie grew to the point that it was all I talked about so in May of 2002, me, my parents and my brother went to go see Attack of The Clones and after the end credits rolled, I was gobsmacked by what I had just watched. Much like The Phantom Menace before it, I simply adored Attack of The Clones and I remember watching it many more times. However, as I grew older I began to hear that the film was even worse than The Phantom Menace and I was taken aback as I loved the movie for what it was and had seen nothing wrong with it apart from it's long-winded run time but upon rewatching Attack of The Clones in preparation for seeing Episode 9 later this year, I found it to be a tedious and boring film when it came to the story, running time, dialog and the characters while I was entertained by the action, musical score and some of the acting.",0

But boy, when I walked out from the theatre, I was consumed with an overwhelming desire to buy another ticket and walk right back in. Yes I am a huge Star Wars fan, and with Attack of the Clones, the magic is back once again and I'm loving it.",0

It's a beautiful film of hope, courage, love, and strength. And now for those of you who did not particularly like the character of Jar Jar Binks in 'Episode One' would be happy to know that he only appears in three to four scenes in this one! Oh and my I just say that the fight sequence between Yoda and Count Dooku is amazing and yet so funny to see Yoda kicking some major butt!! 'Episode Two' is one of the best!!",1

1246,5.0,"Infinitely better than the last outing, but that's still damning it with faint praise.  To be fair, there are some wonderful moments here: the thrilling bounty hunter chase through Coruscant; Obi-Wan and Jango's rain-soaked one-on-one; and the chillingly vicious Lightsaber Round Robin finale  Yoda's 'Matrix'-style moves notwithstanding.  Jar Jar is mercifully relegated to the minor (and rather apt) role of unwitting traitor, and Christopher Lee brings some much needed gravitas to the whole affair. Though the story drags in places, it's reasonably well-structured, balancing the action with the necessary (though soggy) romance.  And the motivation for Anakin's descent into evil is credible, even if Hayden Christensen's performance isn't.  Yet, once again, Lucas sabotages what could have been his masterpiece with what is now clearly a CGI-obsession bordering on clinical insanity.  Entire sequences, such as the droid assembly line (Coming soon to a Playstation near you!) and the 'Gladiator'-inspired arena battle, are plainly motivated by nothing more than the desire to do something cool with effects.  But they aren't cool.  They're mind-numbingly boring.  The climactic battle between droids and clones is so self-consciously spectacular that the audience is left feeling more alienated than engaged.  Sure, CGI played a role in every scene in this film  even the ones I loved.  But that wasn't what I loved about them.  For me, it was one or two of the humans who nearly saved the day.  In particular, the performance of Ewan McGregor, with his wryly humorous Alec Guinness impersonation and his ability to wring some semblance of credibility from even the most banal of Lucas's lines, was almost enough to salvage the entire production.

1252,7.0,"Admittedly, I cut Lucas some slack here. I expected far worse. This is a major improvement to the last crapfest mostly because it is much darker and there is hardly any Jar-Jar-pollution. Shame about the awful love scenes, as they interrupt the otherwise entertaining action. And of course, as always with Lucas, the acting sucks to the next dimension. The Yoda fight is spectacular. Finally, having watched a digital screening, the technique behind this film is clearly the future. Ten years from now everyone will shoot digitally, and I welcome that, as it is far superior and cheaper than film stock.",0
1253,8.0,"Overall, there is no doubting that Episode II : Attack of the Clones is a lot more complete and well rounded than Epusode I : The Phantom Menace. This film is very interesting for the fact that it is the first time you see the jedi as more than a dying order with all but a few members left. In the movie you witness them in the prime of their order and it truly is an awesome display, especially when the clone troopers arrive to back them up. Also, this movie shoes why Yoda is the head Jedi Master ;) Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is Anakin Skywalker. In the original trilogy we hardly knew anything of Anakin from his past life aside from he was a great jedi and general of the republic who simply succumbed to the dark side. Throughout the movie it is very obvious that the internal struggle that is going on inside of Anakin, he is torn between the light and dark sides of the force. He is a good person with a great heart but there are certain things that set him off where he loses control of his emotions. One of these include being held back by his master Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Order, who are reluctant to give him his Jedi Trial despite of how skillful he is. To give you an idea of how powerful he is, after a mere 10 years of Jedi training he outperforms and last longer in a fight with the main villain of the movie Count Dooku than Obi-Wan does despite Obi-Wan having well over 20 years of Jedi training and him being a master Jedi. The main conflict that Anakin seems to be confronted with is his love affair with Padme and how it is against the Jedi code. The movie has its romantic parts but Lucas doesn't overkill it so don't worry, it's actually a pleasant change compared to Episode I which was devoid of any such feelings. Overall, this movie delivers, it has good solid acting, awesome special effects, and a great story. This is up there with Empire and Jedi for me, it really is that good and a must see for any Star Wars fan or even casual movie-goer.",1

Spoiler included in review I scan the Attack of Clones: techinal manual before seeing the movie and now after seeing the movie I have too many questions. First, who is the clone army working for: the Separtists, the Republic, or the evil emperor? Why did Lucas remove references to the Blue old republic Army and the emperor's Red body Guard pictured in the tech manual? Is Ben Lars (Luke's uncle) biological related to Ana Skywalker, if not are they still half-brothers? When is Lucas going to show the planet Aldareen (Princess Leia's homeworld)? And finally am I the only who thought Yoda looked better as a wrinkled muppet (Empire Strikes Back) than a digital fighting animation (Attack of Clones)?

1260,3.0,"With this dreadful installment the Star Wars franchise has succeeded in becoming a parody of itself, sinking under leaden exposition, bad casting, worse acting and overcomplicated soap opera plotlines, drifting lamely from scene to scene, punctuated occasionally by some noteworthy special effects. The whole notion is somewhat absurd; we already know what will happen, so what is the point of these ""prequals""?  Simply to sell more plastic dolls and pajamas?  The spontaneous thrills and excitement of the first Star Wars was never equalled, but the second and third installments were good enough. Attempting to repeat that magic with new casts in new movies set in the past (again, filling out a history we all know, and apparently better off in viewers' imaginations) is indeed a fool's errand, and obviously those associated with these productions live up to this billing admirably.

1265,10.0,"Well, it looks like Ol' George hasn't lost it after all! ""Attack of the Clones"" is pure Star Wars from beginning to end. It is lovely, dark, and can sometimes get a bit creepy. Those other critics don't know what the heck they're talking about. Take Roger Ebert, for example, who has panned ""Clones"" but gave ""The Phantom Menace"" an extremely positive review back in 1999. ""Menace"" wasn't horribly atrocious, but it was too kiddy-friendly, had crappy acting, and a story and feel that just didn't feel like our beloved Star Wars. But now fans are rejoicing! Not only is there pretty good acting this time, but the movie is relentlessly dark, has a great story, and contains all the elements and formulas that made the old ones so awesome. It also has more Yoda.  Truly spectacular! Ewan McGregor has a young version of Alec Guiness down to a tee, Hayden Christensen has good facial expressions and seems to be trying hard most of the time. Natalie Portman is also better this time. The acting, though it CAN get a little poky is very satisfying overall. Everything in this one works, from the great settings (some will be all too familiar), to the truly astonishing CG work. There are also many treats for fans and surprising lead-ins for the original trilogy. I cannot stress more how much of an improvement ""Attack of the Clones"" is from ""The Phantom Menace"".

I think I may be in a vast minority here but I actually liked Ep.I better. There seemed to be a lot more going on story-wise. You could see an arch building to reach Ep. IV. I thought it was very interesting. All except for (again casting myself into the minority) the pod-race scene: it held no excitement for me. We know that Anakin is going to grow up to be Darth Vader so where's the threat of him dying in a pod-race? But we're here to talk about Ep. II, aren't we? Well I know my 2cents is coming in a little late, but I had to get this off my chest(**spoilers ahead**)deep breath, here goes. I'm not lacking in the appreciation of a good romance, but enough with the forbidden love stuff already we know they get together. get it over with and get on with the story. Get on with Anakin becoming the Dark Lord of the Sith. We only have one more Episode left, don't waste it! You could be explaining so much, like who the Sith are and why we should be afraid of them. Instead we get sexual tension. Ok, but we know they get together! We could be seeing the clone war and where that leads us or the construction of the Death Star or even more (spoilers) Yoda kickin some serious butt. But no, we get the young lovers rolling around in the grass for Pete's sake! What about Shmi? That whole part was so unfulfilling. Like, Hi, Mom' uchhh dead. Then, oh then, we only HEAR about what he did at the Tuskin Raider camp! I mean jeez, get on with the meat of the story. The battle between good and evil.  We KNOW THEY GET TOGETHER!

Like, there were a couple tense scenes where you just knew this was when Anakin was gonna loose that hand!. And then there were the jokes like, Anakin is going to be the death of me.' That was good.. and of courseYoda. All hail Master Yoda! Yeah. So, in summary: as I think I've illustrated here, I believe too much time was spent on a plot line that held no suspense or mystery and a digression from one that began this whole ADVENTURE.

In my opinion, Lucas has so developed his scope and concept for the films attitude, that he forgot to allow one very special thing to happen: Allow the actors to act. I got teary-eyed at some of the action scenes rather than the development of sympathies and antipathies involving the character development.  There is where the trees go in the way.

The acting is certainly upgraded from the previous Star Wars movie, with Anakin being the more emotional and hate filled adult who has many conflicting emotions including the fear of losing his loved ones, his secret love for Padme and the hatred and anger that develops throughout the film, thereby following word for word Yoda's teachings of Episode's I and V.

Because it's a lot of fun. Sure the hour after the Coruscant chase is anywhere from talky to boring, but look at the bright point of this all: Less Jar-Jar and no Jake Lloyd. When Jar-Jar is on screen, he's helping out the bad guy. Then the movie becomes a lot of fun. The end fight scenes have a lot of stuff happening and it's awesome. The best part about this movie is that it avoids having like 3 different battles happening at once and it sticks to one at a time. It goes from having the arena battle, to the attack of the clones, to the fight with Dooku. The previous two movies had too many battles happening once. Going from one battle, to the next then another one then cutting back to them again. Then Yoda comes along and steals the movie and makes just his 5 minutes in the sun worth the price of admission alone. The best part about this movie is that it sets up the next one perfectly. I can't wait to see it, if this movie is any indication, Lucas hasn't lost it; the force is strong with this one. :-)",0

Well, maybe it doesn't. But perhaps part of the reason for this is simply that many of us were young impressionable children in 1977 or 1980 and so we were more likely to be overwhelmed by a picture (any picture) than we are today.",1
1296,10.0,"I was very pleased with Star Wars Episode II.  The action scenes were very good and the special affects were first rate.  Everything fit very nicely with the other films.  It was very obvious that Lucas has taken great pains to make sure the film fit with the rest and did not contradict the each other.  This made the film very enjoyable.  If you are a stickler for detail, I would advise that you see all of the other Star War's movies again before you see this one and concentrate on the small things.  There are a lot of little hints here and there that you may not pick up if you don't have the other films fresh in your mind. ",1

I firmly believe Lucas has misunderstood what made his original trilogy so popular and timeless: good characters. These cardboard cut-outs of heroes and villains are simply set decoration for the real stars: the effects (which I thought were rather poor...it was like watching a video game). Anakin has to be one of the most unlikebale character on celluloid. Is anyone going to care when this kid goes bad? No way. Let him have it. I can't stand him. I read a review which brought up a great point: imagine if Anakin were a Han Solo type brimming with charm. Watching a character like that become seduced into the dark side would be far more tragic and interesting. ",0

There is a family tradition of two decades whereby I take my son Rich to the new ""Star Wars"" movie and, although he is now in his mid-twenties and a fully fledged Jedi knight, we still honour that tradition - and it was just as well because, on occasions, this 50-something fan needed a bit of explanation of a convoluted plot.",1

So AOTC has a lot to live up to. To all of those who say that AOTC and TPM are just movies, I have to state that it would be nice if that truly was the case.

I gagged when Anakin and Padme rolled around in the grass ........ It´s been mentioned before: Why does Yoda use a cane to walk when he can fly around like a Mexican jumping bean? And what annoyed me the most: The ""changling"" that Anakin and Obi chase down.  It just seemed so Star Trekkish. Sometimes I felt that George Lucas was trying to do too much in one movie. So many loose ends to tie up before the last prequel ...... Good special effects though!  Would you expect less?",0

This was a disappointment. The performances by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are the worst portrayals of Star Wars characters I've ever seen, and Jar Jar is not there for light hearted bits. Now, Jar-Jar at least brought some charm to make TPM happier. Here, he is just there for some important things and that's it. The script is very lazy and boring, nothing anybody said worth remembering, just like Roger Ebert said, bless his soul. While I will admit that Mace Windu is cool in this with the lightasaber duels and the clone troopers are very epic when it comes to the battles, AOTC is just a stiff, forgettable, and just plain frustrating Star Wars film only being released for toys.",0

A few good action sequences, but nothing even remotely resembling a plausible story.",1
1314,7.0,"Star Wars Episode I was made for kids.  I firmly believe children will hate Episode II.  It is the anti-Phantom Menace, and not a kids' movie at all. It isn't action-heavy.  It has a lot of plot and dialogue, foreshadowing, and mystery to it...and romance (I fear more than a lot of people can stand).  ATTACK OF THE CLONES is quite a film.  From a technical standpoint it is superb (although I'm sure I prefer a puppet-Yoda to a CGI-Yoda).  It does have a few magnificent action scenes.  Its not what you'd call a ""fun"" movie, though.  The original 1977 STAR WARS (""Episode 4"") film was fun, as was RETURN OF THE JEDI and THE PHANTOM MENACE.  ATTACK OF THE CLONES fits in better with EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and is a very dark film.  (How this movie didn't get a PG-13 is a mystery up there with the Kennedy Assassination and Jack the Ripper.)  It has doses of humor, action, and fun, but those elements are overshadowed by the suspense and mystery of it.  If you go into the film with that mindset, you'll enjoy yourself and be quite pleased with ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  If you're expecting another Episode 4, you'll be disappointed.",1
1315,6.0,"The long-awaited sequel of the new Star Wars sequel arrives, and honestly, it was not what I have expected. The grown up Anakin, played by Hayden Christensen is nothing more than a very irritating teenager and for me it's tough to imagine him as a future Darth Vader. His teachers, Obi-Wan and Yoda are not better - Kenobi looks like a beggar, not like an old warrior and for Yoda the less I say, better. Padme also is very unpleasant young woman and with ALL good guys annoying the movie loses much. The love story between Anakin and Padme is horrible. It is pathetic, slow and cheesy and I personally hope that awful things will happen to these two in the next installment. However, the movie has its strong moments and they are delivered by the bad guys. Darth Sidious proved again his malice and cunning characters, Jango Fet was extremely cool and count Dookoo, played by the legend Christopher Lee is simply the best. The action scenes in the movie are spectacular, maybe the best in the whole saga and the visual effects one more time are outstanding. This almost made the film great, but with so unlikable main characters it is just OK. I hope for a better Episode 3.",0

1322,5.0,"I was honestly surprised by 'Attack of the Clones'. It was so disappointing, even after 'The Phantom Menace', that I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few caricatures wandering around the galaxy and waiting to do something. The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes just began on their own, coming from nowhere with a booming, albeit good, John Williams soundtrack. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by the overwhelming special effects. Most of the film looked like it was recorded in front of a green screen. The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a bit of fun watching it at home. Definitely can't hold a candle to the original trilogy, though.",0
1323,,Attack of the Clones can be summed up in two statements:,0
1324,6.0,"Out of all the Star Wars works outside of Disney, Attack of the Clones is probably the most difficult to talk about it. It's lows are just as evident as its highs, but it also manages to pull off gifting the viewer a truly cinematic experience (unlike the sequels).",1

1326,2.0,"Let me say this as a springboard for the rest of this review: I still don't buy the Annakin becomes Vader story. Lucas stated that these two persons were distinct individuals, not the same person, way back in the summer of 1977. Watch A New Hope and listen to Ben talk about Vader and Luke's Father and you'll hear it. Yoda also speaks of two different people in Empire. I choose to believe them. So what happened? Lucas changed his story after Empire to please the fans, and all the myth building went into the toilet. That brings us to the latest episode from Lucas. In 1977 and again in 1980, Lucas made two films that sucked me into their world and took me for an incredible ride. It was a ride I was glad to go on many times. Clones sucked also, but in a completely different way. I don't know whether it was the sucky dialogue, the bad acting or the lousy story that turned me off within five minutes. I was not involved at all in the film. I was so tempted to speak back at the screen a dozen times or more, but my wife kept pinching me just as those moments happened. I slipped once, when Annakin asked Sen. Armadillo, `Are you suffering like I am?' I screamed, `Yes, we are.' This brought cheers from the audience. The audience, by the way, sat in stunned silence as the suckieness unfolded. Everything was wrong with this film. Only Christopher Lee and Obi-Wan brought any class to this dreck. It just plain sucked, in more ways than I have room here to relate. Take away all the razzle dazzle creatures and effects and the costumes and the sets and nothing is left but an empty, boring shell with nothing to say. For instance, when Obi-wan just walks into the HQ of the cloning world, the clone masters take him and show him everything. They don't ask for any kind of ID or proof that he's whom they were waiting for. They just assume that he's a Jedi and he's here for an inspection tour. The old Lucas would have shown the audience how the character would have bluffed his way through, ala Han Solo. The new Lucas blows any opportunity to create suspense at all. Even the fight with Jimbo Billy Bob Fett at the complex didn't raise any kind of alarm among the cloners. I guess they just never look out their windows, nor do they turn their communications gear on to hear Jethro Fett tell them that this Jedi was a spy. Nope, they don't do any of that, and the clone shipment goes ahead without a hitch. Stupid writing, even stupider plotting, sink this sucky excuse for a film in ten minutes. It was not compelling in any way, despite the effects. In fact, as I watched, I kept thinking that the effects were being wasted worse than putting curtains on a camel. As impressive as Star Wars and Empire were in their time, Clones is repulsive. I think the audience agrees with me, as the last time I looked, Clones was sinking fast at the box-office. I've said enough. I'll go back now and watch Spiderman, a far superior film.",0

As always the music is really good. The other thing I thought could have worked was the plot and idea of the clone army/wars. The clone wars are a really cool and interesting topic and showing how they began would have really gripped me if this movie was just executed better. The movie is more gripping and interesting that episode 1, but not by a lot. The performances were decent, with the stand out being ewan mcgregor, who really stepped up and improved massively from episode one. The special effects are ok, but nothing amazing. The dialogue is where this film really lacks though. I feel like George Lucas has an amazing imagination and can come up with these worlds and ideas for stories but when it comes time to sit down and write the story he struggles, and this problem is only evident in the first 2 episode of Star Wars. Following the basic premise of a clone army popping up out of know where to fight for the Jedi against a droid army controlled by an intriguing evil Sith Lord is interesting. But when you dove deeper to how George Lucas wrote this story, it hurts because this movie could have been so much more. Overall episode 2 was a big let down considering how much missed potential there was.",0

While PHANTOM and JEDI were juvenile, CLONES is more satisfying in its action sequences (especially Yoda's battle near the end) and covers a lot of ground for Episode III.

Replacing them are not as childish but equally as one-dimensional and dense cardboard characters. None of them memorable.

1348,5.0,"Okay, it is official. The success of Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back is due in no small part to the input of Gary Kurtz, and other people who left the franchise before Return of the Jedi was completed. This left George Lucas to make all the major creative decisions, which unfortunately, were not always good choices. The Special Edition changes were mostly not good ideas, and the Phantom Menace was awful. Just awful. Attack of the Clones is an improvement(less Jar Jar helps), but it still suffers from Lucas' unfettered direction and writing. Hales could not help. The dialogue is flat and unmemorable. The acting is uninspired, lifeless. MacGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi is good, but he is much too whiney. Christensen may be a good actor(havent seen him in anything else to compare), but he comes across very bad here. And Portman--she is wonderful to look at, but she has no charisma. C3PO is an asset, but his lines are basically bad puns. And Yoda? Well, his fight scene at the end was just ridiculous. The audience I saw it with was laughing--for all the wrong reasons. Lucas apparently does not care about continuity. It was bad enough to make Darth Vader the creator of C3PO, but to find him (mild spoiler) doing the precise job that he is purchased from the Jawas to do for the very same person in ANH is just insane. (end of mild spoiler) And the biggest let down may be John Williams score. Oh, how times have changed. Maybe JW just could not get inspired by what was on the screen, but whatever the case, the score is very uninvolving. It is quite sad to see George Lucas destroy his own reputation. This film lacks the spirit that made the original films so much fun. No, they were not high brow, but they were mighty entertaining. Sadly, AOTC was not.  I wont look forward to Episode 3, I just hope Lucas has the good sense to make the original trilogy available on DVD--without the SE changes.",0

And so is the movie as a whole also, it ranks over all other Star Wars movies in my book except Star Wars: Episode 4 - ANH which is hard to beat. I like the acting including Hayden Christensen and the script is much better than when Lucas wrote it himself. Of course the movie is not without flaws, but very close to it. I don't know what's up with the negative comments here, feels like an insult. They're probably jealous or something. If you like Science Fiction or movies in general, let the force guide you to the nearest movie theater and see it now! I've only seen it once, but just have to see it many more times! My score: 10/10.",1
1357,10.0,"I must admit, I left the theatre wondering if there was anything else I could ask for in a film.  I could think of nothing.  Though I have always enjoyed the Star Wars saga, I consider myself difficult to please in regards to films.  I found this film had everything I enjoy in entertainment: great characters, solid plot-line, brilliantly choreographed action sequences, a very human element, love.  This is a fantastic film.  Better yet, the Star Wars story just keeps getting better and better.  The highest recommendation.  Go have a blast.  Cheers.",1

This movie does have sort of a weird ending.  I also like this movie because it has so much action that you do not even have the time to eat popcorn or sip a very expensive concession stand drink.  The actors and actresses do an outstanding job of playing their role.  I also think that this is a movie that everyone could like because it is action-filled as I said, a sci-fi movie and a romantic love story.  I encourage everyone to see this outstanding movie.  So if you liked Episode 1, you will LOVE Episode 2. It is much better.  I give it a 10/10.",1
1360,,"George Lucas could make films once - why can't he now? The answer may be painfully clear now that Eps I, II, and III are out - George Lucas never COULD make films. Now, stick with me on this - he didn't have complete control over IV, V, and VI. Lawrence Kasdan wrote dialog and the was SOME limit on his special effects. It has become evident that, when George is given an unlimited budget and full writing duties, he stops writing and just plays with the computers all day long. Seriously, the movie just Bataan-Death-Marches from one long, pointless CGI sequence to the next, occasionally interspersed with truly stultifying ""political"" sequences. Fun, huh? The love story sequences, such as they are, could not be more stilted and awkward. Whatever pleasant, magical nostalgia Lucas didn't ruin in The Phantom Menace, he ruins in this movie. Other folks have pointed this out, but THERE IS NO CLEAR HERO. For whom are we cheering here? Darth Vader? Obi Wan? Yoda?? This movie fails on that count alone - we can't even perform the basic act of choosing sides.",0
1361,6.0,"Oh well - it's not that i didn't like it. The problem is THIS. ""It's not that i didn't like it"". Ok, ok, maybe i am old, maybe i am high on expectations on Star Wars. My point is, you have reached a level of graphic effects in which you can do ANYTHING (and make do by actors as well). So how comes that Yoda (by far the absolute spotlight) didn't stir in me the sheer delight of when i saw him (it?) in SW5 ? And coming to that, when the best actor in the movie is a puppet-computer effect, there's something to think about, isn't it? The young Anakin is a promise, granted, but i still stay with a sensation of ""too much"" (special FX, noise, graphics, sequences fit for a videogame) and ""too little"" (character deepening, situation exploring, cameos taken and suddenly dropped). Anyway, if you are an old SW fan, you can go and see this flick. It is a bit like completing your baseball cards collection - but don't expect more.",0
1362,6.0,"I didn't like Attack of the Clones at all at all. After the exciting Phantom Menace chapter I felt that this chapter wasn't as good as the first one and it was far from it. This is what I think of Attack of the Clones: some of the action is boring, dialogs are stiff and there isn't or nearly isn't a single memorable quote (how come?). Also, I hated the battle scene against the creatures in the coliseum-like place on the desert planet of Genosis because looking at it felt like watching a gladiator film rather than watching what I call a true Star Wars film. And the action that came right after this creature battle scene felt so boring. I felt that this coliseum action scene was the worst scene and action scene in the entire Star Wars saga and it also looked like hair that hasn't been combed properly and has been completely messed up. Moreover the movie doesn't have enough planet settings. Also, I think that the difficult relationship shared between Anakin Skywalker and Padme should have been explored in a bit more depth. I had a big feeling of disappointment when I watched this film and I regret that Attack of the Clones is so flawed. I wish it was much better. Oh gosh, how I hate to be disappointed with a film I expect so much from. This movie has a George Lucas being-lazy-directing-well feel to me though I know that George Lucas isn't lazy while making Star Wars films and that there must be a good explanation beneath all of these flaws but still. I'm sure that it is the most important thing to think of. My big question about this film is ""What on earth went wrong with the making of the film?"" Because of all the flaws I just described I just don't get one second why people preferred this chapter over the previous one. Few of the action sequences still dazzle however and that's a nice thing to keep in mind about this Star Wars chapter. Furthermore, the asteroid field near Genosis sequence was particularly good and had good colors even if it lacked suspense to it including the scene at the clone factory on Genosis. Also, the ocean planet of I don't know the name was a suitably memorable planet setting and the alien creatures that welcomed Obi- Wan Kenobi on this planet were great looking aliens and believable. The movie also has some good story ingredients. So the movie isn't entirely flawless after all and thank goodness for that or else...grrrrr. My rating for the Attack of the Clones is 6.1/10. Oh dear.",0
1363,7.0,"""Attack of the Clones"" was good, but it was not as good as the first trilogy. I must say, it has the same makings of ""The Phantom Menace"", but with a twist which will make many fans enjoy it much more than the first. The story is well done enough just get by, and the overall meanings have as much plot impact to them as ""The Phantom Menace"". What can be said about this film it that it makes certain points in the saga very clear and looms on towards what will eventually take place in the next film(s). With much more love depicted and less political jive, it is very well done. The film had its strong points and its weak ones, but the overall story is very craftily done.",1

I am the kind of viewer where small details can win me over or really annoy me when it comes to movies. This movie has several details that really annoy me. Two times in the film does a person die in another persons arms. In both instances it just such big luck that they survive to just die when the other persons comes to them. Then it happening two times. Its just silly. Then towards the end of the movie when Anakin and Obi-Wan where following Count Doku they get to the platform where he jumped of and just when they both jumped of an enemy ship comes and destroys their ship, killing everyone except Obi- wan and Anakin which jumped of first, where the other did not have time to do this. Anakin and Obi-Wan don't even look back and comment this. Its just a so lucky and strangely convenient thing so that its just them, so they can have a sword battle.",0

I still think Jar Jar had too many lines (5 or 6!), but that is a very minor criticism.

Though viable arguments have been made that the prequels have few merits, the fact remains that this is allegedly the continuation of ONE story, thus it should seamlessly meld with its antecedent, not only in flavor and texture, but in quality and substance. Unfortunately, in any one of these facets, the prequels are jaggedly connected to the original by nothing more than a thin layer of cheap glue.

1377,1.0,"First, let me say that I am a Star Wars fan. I have been since I stood in line at the theater on that fateful day in 1977, and I've loved everything since, even Phantom Menace (sure, there were bad points, but I was entertained by the film). That having been said... The only real clones are the sorry fans that will go out and see AOTC multiple times to line the pockets of Mr. Lucas. I get the distinct feeling that George resents having to make these films, after all, he's been dealing with the same basic world-scape since 1977, and more is all anyone seems to want from him-- but only more Star Wars. In response, he has delivered unto his fans a lifeless piece of digital film making. The characters are devoid of any depth, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've heard in a long time. I heard open moans of distaste in the theater at the C3-P0-turned-bad-pun-machine on the battle field. I understand the grainy aspects of the special effects are due to the movie being seen on a film projector instead of a digital one, but come on! This is no excuse for the poor overall quality of the project. It brakes the first cardinal sin of movie making: it's booooooorrrrriiing. The film started off well, and my hopes were high. But it peaked after 35 minutes, and then was flat and unimpressive until the final battle, which seemed truncated and unresolved. I know the storyline needs to be unresolved at this point, but there is no payoff within this film. You wait and wait and wait and there's nothing to justify it. Everything you want to see in this film, as far as the progression of the story-- well, it just never happens. And I can't stress enough how terrible the dialogue is. And I'm so sick of how Lucas tries to interject earthlike/human qualities and catch phrase/poses into his new aliens. If you hated the pod race announcers, and Jar Jar's ""Exsqueeze Me"" lines, you'll be sick after the diner scene in AOTC. (caution, the next sentence may be considered a spoiler) Oh, and why is it called ATTACK of the Clones? How about... Political Maneuvering of the Clones, or Creation of the Clones, or Whatta' Bunch of Clones. I say this because--- THERE IS NO ATTACK!!!!! So, this film is apparently just build up to Episode 3, and was never intended to have a life of it's own. Is that what you're doing here Mr. Lucas? Overall, a disappointing and depressing movie going experience. When Star Wars disappoints, where can you go? Oh, well......",0

The CGI is also pretty ropey but not quite as bad as in the first prequel. Having said all this, I still enjoyed it as it's Star Wars and the whole universe and lore is just so compelling.

1382,,"There is something about the two Star Wars prequels that I just now put my finger on after my first viewing of Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. To be blunt, these films just lack the charm of the original trilogy. The characters are all written and played very straight, almost to the point of becoming two-dimensional. There isn't any natural dynamic or tension between anybody you see on screen. Therefore, every instance of emotion, conflict and even humor come across as forced. The master/apprentice relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan seemed somewhat plastic. My ""exhibit B"" for this argument is Jar Jar from Episode 1. It was obvious he was written as comic relief. He had no other legitimate reason to be there. When you know what the punchline is ahead of time, the joke usually falls flat.",0

It has all the good elements of the original trilogy, and Lucas has managed to at least downplay Jar Jar and the Trade Federation so that it doesn't interfere with the story.  Sadly, the worst oversite, the need of a new director, has not been remedied.  All the elements are there; the actors are all in top form, the special effects are quite good, and the plot, well, that is why we keep coming back.  What this film needed was someone, other than Lucas, to bring it all together. Someone has to restrain Lucas from throwing in way too much computer animation than he knows what to do with.  Sure the droid/clone battle may be the coolest thing we have ever seen, but it is the failures that really stick in your mind.  The beginning of the ""coliseum"" seen is one of them.

Episodes I and II seem fundamentally flawed.  The basic story is dry.  There is action, but no excitement... no tension.  Part of this is the problem inherent in a prequel:  you already know what is going to happen.  But it goes beyond that.  The actual sequence of events has no electricity.  This is compounded by the wooden acting that is rampant in this film (and Episode I).  Since I know that McGregor, Portman, Lee, and others can act from other movies I've seen them in, I suspect the problem lies with Lucas's direction.  Lucas is a wonderful producer and good at creating a basic plot, but he should stay far away from the screenplay and direction.  What he has managed to do with Episodes I and II is create the visually stunning equivalent of a slow motion train wreck.",0

There is great action peppered throughout the film, and paced nicely, interspersed with moments that are slower but more plot intensive.  Hayden Christiansen is cast well as an arrogant young snot of a Jedi who still has some redeeming qualities.  The Jedi as a whole come off as all being a little bit flawed in some way, but this helps with some plot points vital to the series of films as well as this one.  Everyone seems a bit more human and vulnerable in Episode Two, and it reminds me in some ways of the Empire Strikes Back; the characters are under the gun and their weaknesses show.  Even when things look temporarily better, there are people who point out that it's far from over. The special effects are far beyond amazing, and the all-digital filming is completely unnoticeable; it all looks real, and like it was shot on film. George Lucas seems to be getting back into the swing of things as a director; there was some cool tricky ""camera"" work, and the actors seem more comfortable when talking to characters who could not possibly have been there when they were shooting it, a quality not always present in the previous film.  Coruscant is beautiful here, with a nice amalgam of visual styles in the architecture and what seemed to be one brief nod to Blade Runner.  The other worlds fare well.  Fans of the films will be happy to see that the Skywalker/Lars homestead where Luke will someday grow up on Tatooine is done perfectly.  Tons of fun!",1

Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman did wonderfully in their parts too.  The love story seemed real between them.  My favorite part of the movie though was when Yoda starts kicking some butt....I thought that that was awesome.  Everyone was clapping for Yoda along with Samuel L. Jackson.

However with the new trilogy well under way what drives us to wait (what seems like light-years) for the next installment. It cant be the story. We all know where it's heading. So it must be the effects. My gripe is this I sat through 2 hours of an unknown personality (and not a very refined one yet) wandering through his mid-jedi crisis, as well as his Louis Lamourish love story, just to get to the special effects. All I could think of when I left the cineplex (other than the sharp pins going through my butt) was that I'm glad DVDs have chapter selections. Because I cannot imagine a child becomi ng as immersed in the last two films as much as I was when I was a child.

Oh, most people will say it's a much better film than ""The Phantom Meance"" and in away, it is. There is no annoying Jar Jar Binks or Jake Lloyd. The endless dialog scenes of ""Phantom"" are no longer evident and the movie is much more action-packed. However, I felt there was no tension or real excitement in the picture.

I thought Episode II was a complete disaster, even worse than the first one. Lucas blew several opportunities to display graphic violence for scenes of lush meadows and stormy seas. What this movie needed was an edge, and only the type of edge that the monumental and legendary actor Billy Drago can deliver. At least he could have saved the film. This movie isn't dark because it is negative and warlike, it is dark because everyone falls asleep while watching it.  Episode III better well be violent as hell (because of this supposed war that is supposed to be happening) or else I will be forced to finally conclude that Lucas is catering to all the little Kiddies out there in theater land. Why can't he make movies like Episode IV, where Spock dies and Robert or whatever his name is has to go and save him from the hideous, flame-throwing monster?",0

While I do agear that it is weak rather forgettable,but I disappear that its the worst movie ever made. its not that bad at all but I think it could of been a tiny bit more stronger here list of things that made this film weak. 1. too much romance okay in the empire strikes back their was bit of romance but not to the point of romance in this one. 2. not enough Jango fett or Count Douko as I think that we don't much about these expect that douko did appear a lot in the clone wars series but I would like to know a little bit more of Jango Fett as he had less scream time in this whole film.

1455,6.0,"This film is a disaster of cinema on a scale that could probably rank up there with 'Cleopatra' or similar botched attempts at ""epic"" cinema. George Lucas has, indeed, ""lost his touch"", as some people have said but it could be more easily explained this way: George Lucas has simply decided that the scripts of his STAR WARS prequels don't really matter that much and can be developed ""along the way"". In my opinion, and most REALLY GOOD FILMMAKERS would probably agree, this is ASS BACKWARDS. In LucasLand, apparently, you can start with an ""idea"", pay a huge staff of VERY creative graphic artists and painters to design vehicles, make models, choreograph scenes on the computer without ever having seen THE SCRIPT. Don't agree? Check out THE ART OF STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES and you will see pages upon pages of beautiful renderings and designs that were completely wasted on a film with no script. Don't agree? Read the sorry ass excuse for a script at the back of said book. This script is so bad, it is unbelievable. It truly shows how much contempt Lucas has for the written word and this man should never be allowed near a typewriter. If I were one of the designers on this film, or The Phantom Menace for that matter, I would quit. I wouldn't want my BABIES, ships and locales that I slaved over to be used in service of some of the most haphazard and shoddy storytelling this side of Corusant. Don't agree? Watch Anatomy of a Murder. Psycho. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Kramer VS. Kramer. Star Wars. Alien. These films all had one thing in common. Before there was a CHECK cut to anyone, there was a script. Before a date was scheduled, there was a SCRIPT. It's too bad that we give Lucas so much power- somebody really needs to say no to this guy. ""Sorry George,"" I would say if I were THAT GUY, ""but you may not start this new series of films until I see AT THE VERY LEAST a script for the FIRST ONE. Oh, and most people do five or so drafts and have other people LOOK AT IT so they can tell you when you are being a dunderhead (Jar Jar, or all of the dialogue in AOTC, for example). THEN AND ONLY THEN MAY YOU COMISSION THE ARTISTS NEEDED TO PULL THIS THING TOGETHER! Not before, no, not before."" Lucas has put the cart before the horse, my friends and so that is why these films are classically bad. We are witnessing failure on a colossal scale. I'm not talking box office. If these films were good, they would be pulling down twice as much- AT LEAST- no, I'm talking about QUALITY. I'm talking about LOVE. WE LOVE STAR WARS because the first ones (or at least the first two) were made with LOVE. Like Grandma's chocolate chip cookies. The new ones? Apparently Grandma's gone crazy and decided to ALTER THE RECIPE. She is now adding the sugar AFTER BAKING THEM. See how crazy it is?",0

I remember way back when - reading reviews of ANH and ESB and none ever got 'amazing' reviews.  It was the public that made them 'classics'.  They are so steeped today in nostalgia and pastiche that an 'untouchable' quality have been brought upon them.  Most people who dislike Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones could not have been pleased by any new Star Wars film so 'untouchable' in there minds are the original 3.  I will admit the new film lacks any 'iconic' characters like Chewie or Han or a 'bad-guy' like Vader.  But the story of how Palpatine is coming to power is intriguing.  The action scenes are still as good as ever.  The cheesy romance is necessary.  It takes place amongst a fairytale renaissance dream world and this evokes their young energy, spirit and dreams.  ",1

Having seen all the Star Wars films, most of them multiple times, I'd have to say the only one I liked less was Episode I.

Yes, some of the lead acting was wooden and the dialogue hokey, but hey...didn't anyone remember the first movie?? Mark Hamill? Carrie Fisher? No? Hey, they were awful, but I still loved the movie.

Hell even minor characters like Salacious Crumb (the monkey-pet of Jabba the Hutt) were colorful.  The main characters also changed noticably a lot as the trilogy progressed, and that's why we loved them and wanted to know what happened to them...Han became less of a loner and realized some causes were worth fighting for; Luke became less adventurous, more introspective, and more scared of his own destiny; Leia let down her defenses towards Han and matured into one of the main leaders of the Rebellion; and Vader began showing signs of humanity towards his son.",0

For the first time since the Empire Strikes Back the trilogy really focused on the mysteries of the Force and really gave viewers a gutsy well written story. I have read critics who have lambasted the movie as having campy dialogue and less than stellar acting.  I am a regular movie goer and know the original trilogy by heart and if the reviewers that were critical of this movie had actually watched the movie as a continuation of the same story or a preface to the original series, those reviewers would see that this movie comes much closer to the vision of the earlier movies.  Lets face it folks, when it comes time for the Academy Awards, the Star Wars movies win on technical merit as well as musical accompaniament.

They're supposed to be!  That's the life of the Jedi, being the peacemakers of society.  Even Ben mentions in ANH that before the Empire, everything was more civilized and sophisticated.  The reason everything/one is so relaxed in the original 3 movies is because there in no Republic, just a band of freedom fighters called the Rebellion who are trying to overthrow the Empire.  The scenes of the Imperial army in the old trilogy were boring in the same sense the Republic political scenes are boring.  We're seeing AOTC through the eyes of the good guys who are still in charge, not the little group of bad guys trying to overthrow the good ones.  It's the opposite of what we saw in the originals, a totally different perspective, and it works great in the overall story.",0

Now to Jengo Fett, who is the original clone and father to everyone's favorite Bounty Hunter, Boba Fett.  ""Little Fett"" as I call him, is there for the kids (Ok no problem)  However Jengo is there for us Big kids, who have waited over 20 years to see him kick butt.  Unfortunately you get 1 cool fight at the beginning, then he gets the AX toward the end.

It almost makes me wish someone would slap him on the back of the head and tell him to ask for directions already, cause Georgy boy is as lost as you can get.  These movies have such potential, they have so much to offer us.  Can't we just get the movie so promised to us?  It's almost as if Mr. Lucas is thinking, well, there is no way that this movie will not make a zillion dollars so I can go ahead and write what I want and that way I get to do it all myself.  ",0

And to my cynical surprise ,I still HATE this movie.<br /><br />I am a STAR WARS MEGA FAN since I'm a kid even if i wasn't born in the times. Anyways ,Attack of the Clones is boasted by completely boring dramatic and romantic sequences ,messy action sequences and too much drama.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace was something new ,a really deep dramatic toned addition to the saga and I didn't liked it so much because of the boring political drama.<br /><br />Anyway, Attack of the clones really shows Anakin Skywalker's first major steps into the dark side in two sequences and that's it and yeah there few action sequences and Count Dooku rocks but there are lots of odd boring drama and romance.",0

The theater was almost full, but not as full as it was when I saw Spider-Man on the first show of the first day.. I liked the movie quite a bit, as I am a fan of Star Wars.. I true fan must like it.. But it was missing something, mostly people.. See when they made episode one, most of the characters, and things around them were real, with CGI (computer generated images) over some of the make up and costumes, to make things look more real. But I found in this movie that even Yoda was 100% a CGI... And in most shots when you would think there should have been a stunt man or at least a human on blue screen, they just made the whole person a CGI.. And you could tell.. Some of the CGI's in this movie looked like an old 3DO game.. It was easy to tell that most of the actors had done complete scenes, (and most of the scenes this way) with a blue screen not knowing what was going to be put behind them later.. I thought the casting job was done well, I was glad to see they didn't try something stupid like casting big names for people such as Anakin Skywalker.. I did like his character, and the attitude they placed with him.. Other than the lack of non computer use, the movie was done to set up the next one in the series.. The clone wars has to be in the next movie, because it was not in this one.. Ok Here it is.. Ten years later, things have changed, so much in fact an hour of the movie sets up to explain everything.. After that, we see Anakin and Padmé, sort of fall in love.. I would say the movie starts with a beginning, beginning, beginning, middle, middle, and then we finally see some Jedi Fighting, and then the credits.. No one wins, in fact I would say the bad guys win in a way.. Nothing like the last movie, that movie started and then we saw fighting, and we were taken from there, one thing happened after another, until in the end we are at piece, everything worked out, there was a plot, beginning, middle and end.. Episode 2 doesn't have any of that.. Though we get to see Yoda in action for the first time!! This movie will be a great movie when the next one comes out, until than, it will just p**s you off to see it, because you will want to know what will be next!!!! I almost want to go see it again, just to see if more happens the next time around.. I give it 5 out of 10 stars.. Hit, or Miss..",0
1494,6.0,"Ah, the simplicity of the original STAR WARS: A standard McGuffin (the Death Star plans) to set the action in motion, a few heroes trying to rescue a princess, a bad guy in black.  It's hard to believe that the writer-director who so masterfully conceived this space western could muck things up so much, both with complicated politics (who are we really supposed to be rooting for?) and inane dialogue.  The film nearly comes to a standstill whenever Hayden Christensen, as Annakin-cum-Darth Vader, spills his heart to dear Padme' (Natalie Portman).  As I suspected after LIFE AS A HOUSE, Christensen is a sincere and intense actor, but not a very good one.  His face is boyish and flat, without any character, definition, or shadow: he's like a breathing Ken doll.  But despite being a magnet for complaining fans, I won't trash the film.  I went to see it eyes-wide-open, knowing what Lucas's obsessions have become: It is not even a ""film"" in the technical sense -- the whole thing was shot digitally -- because Lucas has turned into a techno-geek.  His way may be the future of how movies WILL be MADE, but it is not how they SHOULD be FELT.  Just as FINAL FANTASY reminded us why actors usually are needed to make audiences care, CLONES stands as an important and fairly entertaining example of the potential of technology, without doing much damage to the promise that good screenwriting and actor trump all kinds of glitz.  Of course you should see it; but don't be seduced by the dark side. (c)",0

The acting was the usual wooden standard of the series although Samuel L.Jackson was good. The story was better also, but I was disappointed that Jango Fett was killed off too easily just like Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace. This movie was more in keeping with Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, which is still my favourite of the series so far. All in all a vast improvement on episode 1.",0

Don't get me wrong the overly long abomination has some merit to it upon the first watching.

Non-stop action, plus a few things we've never seen in a Star Wars movie before, for example, Jedi council members Mace Windu and Yoda going to help out Obi-Wan Kenobi and getting involved with the Clone Wars. I've never been much of a stickler for the dialogue George Lucas writes, which admittedly is not that great, but what he lacks in prose, he makes up for in visualization.

Still, the film holds your attention well and will appeal strongly to fans of the franchise or even to casual movie goers. An improvement on the Phantom Menace, but still slightly lacking that element that made us cheer on Luke despite the odds... maybe, however, this is because we know where Anakin is heading, where the toher offered an element of surprise. Regardless, this film holds water, it functions, and is truly fun to watch.

The plot is still too reliant on the episodic sequence, it doesn't stand alone. The romance is cringingly awful, Amidala/Padme refuses Anakin's advances then all of a sudden says she loves him. There is no consequence for Anakin's evil deeds. There are plot holes (landing in a vent of steam and walking through it would be deadly). The end battle is spectacular, but you don't really care about any of the characters. The film's over long and some of the set pieces drag. There only good performances come from Yoda, Christopher Lee and the bloke who plays Django Fett. And Jar Jar's still in it. You want some deathsticks? (groan).",0

I found myself yawning a few times there, and it seemed telling that though the theater was packed with kids, there was no fanfare among them. When I saw Star Wars and Empire, there was a tangible and very audible excitement there. I think the effects and creatures and spaceships flying through space just aren't all that impressive anymore, especially when you don't have a really compelling story and characters to root for within all of that.",1

George Lucas needs someone who can write good dialogue to co-write the screenplay with him for episode 3.  The romance was weak though it was not as bad as I expected it to be from what I was told.

So what went wrong?  Apart from Ewan Mcgregor's fantastic Obi-Wan Kenobi, the acting is HORRIBLE.

Ok, now we see why did Lucas said that he waited so long for the effects to improve. When it comes to visuals this probably is one of the best in saga. But when it comes to story and what Star Wars are really about, then it´s no better than chapter I, maybe in some ways even worse. But still, there are a few points that I liked. Since the new trilogy is more about silly politics than anything else, I really liked how he treats Palpatine. I could see his rise from the strange character in shadows to the Great Emperor in the old trilogy. We all knew that in Attack of the Clones we are going to witness the start of an Anakin-Amidala romance, but what we got here is dreadful. Dialogues and the whole love story can only be compared to the lines of Dawson´s Creek or some soapish nonsense like that. And the philosophical lines are now laughibly pretentious and meaningless. Again, very similar to chapter one, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch and it has some of the most spectacular scenes ever to be seen in science-fiction cinema.

Clearly, not his strong point - unfortunate due to the sheer volume of these scenes.  The action scenes were quite excellent.  And Yoda - well, you'll see.  Kudos for the action scenes.  Thank goodness we didn't have another intergalactic C-Span for a movie.  The local Washington Post reviewer here said the movie lacked a plot.  This is why almost everyone I know ignores the Washington Post reviewers.  Plot and intrigue galore.

The action was all that and the effects went well into hyper-drive.  I liked how George changed it up in the beginning by letting the camera pans up (instead of down like all the other movies) and revealing Coruscant.

Also, what i consider the main thing that you will remember from this film, is the scene where Yoda battles with Dooku in a light saber duel. Yoda, who is usually slow-moving with the aid of a cane, brings the ultimate example of Jedi skill and style ever seen in a Star Wars movie.

I would place this just above 9 and way above 8 (8 is lying at the depths compared to the rest). The Film has stilted dialogue, effects that have begun to age, and a romance plot that feels awkward most of the time. However, there are some creative set pieces on display and the character of Count Dooku is a welcome addition the Star Wars universe. In addition to this, it serves a greater purpose within the Star Wars universe in setting up The Clone Wars and providing details that are necessary to understanding Anakin's change in character, thus providing more of a reason to exist in the canon than any of the sequel films do. Overall, not great but not as bad as I originally thought.",0

Is this the same universe as the original trilogy? This is moviemaking by the numbers, and done in a very, very bad way. Lucas has forgotten how to direct, write and worse: to make an even slightly entertaining movie. The effects are in some cases awesome, but we're used to that now, so you have to bring a story, likable characters and a sense of joy. It is all missing. Lucas doesn't know what he's doing. That is for certain now. It's action for the sake of action, it serves almost no purpose. The characters are so dull that I personally couldn't care less what's happening to them. Ewan looks out of place and ashamed at sometimes as does Sam Jackson. But the worst mistake Lucas made was bringing Christensen in. Man, what a stiff! OK he was given the most terrible lines, but his acting does make your toes curl...No chemistry with Portman (who's rather flat too). No, I lost my faith in the force. Highlights: Christopher Lee and Yoda's lightsaberaction.",0
1531,1.0,"First of all, it's not entirely because of the lovey-dovey stuff that I do not like this movie.  Nevermind the fact that Portman and Christensen have as much chemistry as Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaghey in ""Contact"": pretty much non-existent.  The literally laughable scenes of ""romance,"" which is defined as ""cheesy sappy one-liners exchanged at an utterly inopportunate timing"" in ""George Lucas' Dictionary of Directing,"" is not the main reason for this movie being particularly bad, but it did make it particularly awful.  Think of it as the proverbial ""cherry on top"" -- not on top of a metaphorical heap of ice cream in this case, but more like a metaphorical heap of cinematic manure. I just thought it was boring.  BOOOOORING....  Not exciting, unless you measure how exciting a film is according to how much visual effects your eyes are assaulted with.  At some point in time, George Lucas that was directing films died and was replaced by one who directs special effects. The rest of the movie feels like it was totally abandoned by the director (and the actors as well at times).  A ten year old can write a script with more clever and exciting lines.  Sam Jackson jumps into battle and utters: ""This party's over!""  Riiiiight....  Christensen mumbles through his confession of love, crying and bitching about ""the kiss you should never have given"" and exclamating, ""I'm in agony!""  Well, SO ARE WE!  Portman confesses her love later on with her ""truly, madly, deeply"" crud.  Haven't seen a more awkward couple since Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles in ""Down To You."" So in neglecting everything that is not related to CG action scenes (and I hope it was neglect, because if that was truly the product of Lucas direction, then he has officially lost his cinematic mojo), Lucas has sacrificed the entire movie.  Since the rest of the movie was incredibly insipid, that meant that the battles had to save the film.  Sad to report, that did not happen.  What a boring movie.  Even the usually decent storytelling wasn't there.  Lucas seems to have lost it.  I think it's a combination of not having directed anything for nearly two decades before Episode I and the utter arrogance that he has come to possess over the years while he was making gazillion dollars off of the first trilogy.  I was actually glad to be assured that Episode II will not be the highest grossing movie this year.  Lucas needs some spanking from some movie-goers with decent taste.  This is worse that Episode I -- there, I said it! And I've said this after I saw Episode I and I'll say it again: I wish this movie was never made.  If I ever run into Mr Lucas, I know what to say: ""Those movies that you should never have made...they haunt me in my dreams. I'm in agony!""",0
1532,3.0,"Who would have thought that Star Wars, one of the most thrilling, dynamic series ever created, would become formulaic; well, it's happened. Around twenty years ago, Star Wars was a series with something for everyone: drama, action, romance; with themes encompassing love, friendship, and family. Now George Lucas is milking that reputation by revamping the original scripts. Not to spoil anything, but the film moves at the same pace as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and has a disgustingly similar conclusion. This occurred with Episode I as well, but in addition the rewritten plot, Episode II features a weak script and poor acting. The obvious hole is generated by the absence of Liam Neeson, whose performance was exemplary in Episode I and whose acting skill seemed to inspire good performances from young stars Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. Now Neeson-less, McGregor and Portman seem rather dry. Portman, whose career has interested me since ""Heat"", turns in her first big lemon. With respect to Portman, I blame this partially on her co-star Hayden Christensen, whose pseudo-sensitive/romantic approach to the role of Anakin Skywalker, comes off as a non-descript monotone with a complete lack of emotion and he seems to drain feeling from every scene. Luckily, the floundering leads have help. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) steal every scene they're in, while the rest of the characters stagger around with poor lines and bad acting until the climactic battle. Whereas `The Empire Strikes Back' was thematically (though not ultimately) the best of the original trilogy, `Attack of the Clones' can hope nothing more than to span the gap between Episode I and III, and let us hope that this will be the low point of the series. 3 out of 10 stars.",0

He is full of enthusiasm, she is sceptical and pragmatic. The dialogue was not stupid, and definitely not boring. There were many interesting and memorable quotes, such as, that Jedi are trained to feel unconditional love. The Phantom Menace, which I do nor consider a bad movie, had many interesting lines too.

1537,6.0,"Alright im just going to get this out of the way, Aotc is better than phantom. ITs got a better story,better action, better effects and just plain more enertaining in my mind. With that said i will now let you know that doesant mean its that great of a movie. The writing is still bad, the acting is still not that great, the special effects are still way over used( the aliens in costumes look much better than the ones that are all computer), and the love story is just plain bad. Im not sure what lucas was thinking when writing out the dialog but its like he cant figure out how to have interesting conversations. Lucas never uses more words than he has to move the plot along(unless its to make a sassy remark at the worst times)Maybe its just me but i like to see normal conversations sometimes so that we can really learn about the characters.Action wise the movie is pretty good. The fight between Obi wan and jongo fett is great and anakin going on a killing spree was suprising and just plain awesome. But other moments when the movie could be great its killed by stupid jokes. The end was getting really good until c3po has to screw it up with bad jokes that dont fit.If Lucas has done anything right its that ill see episode 3 cause there is still a chance to end star wars with a bang. FOr me thats having a plot twist no one see's coming.WHy does anakin have to be Vader? WHy does he have to be the father of luke? With a few great twists at the end of these 3 movies can make you look at the other 3 in a whole new light and give them a whole new meaning. But is Lucas willing to grow some balls and take a chance? I doubt it.",1

1539,,"I just went to see Attack of the Clones for the second time. It was terrific. It wiped out The Phantom Menace, which desecrated the Star Wars Saga. Hayden Christensen was out of this world. He carries this movie. His portrayal of Anakin is exceptional. The climax of the movie is when his anger consumes him to the point, he looses control. A sign of things to come. This one scene has more raw emotion then any other scene in the Star Wars trilogy. This makes Vader's fate more believable. Granted that ATOC is a little of beat in some instances, it accomplishes something that the previous three couldn't. It immerses the audience in the true world of Star Wars to a point that has not been reached before. Gamers have had a glimmer of George Lucas' imagination, but ATOC fully expanded this in the movie. Finally, ATOC set the tone for the movie that I believe will be the most shocking of the 6, and will explain how Anakin becomes Darth Vadar.",1

You nit pick about how it is not well acted or it is not well written, or the special effects are fake.

It says something when c3po and r2d2 were the highlights of the movie providing welcome comic relief from the tedium of the stodgy storyline and acting. After some thought I have decided that what this film really lacked was a Harrisson Ford and a Wookie. All the action and special effects come to nought unless there is a larger than life hero to hold our focus and give the rest of the film some scale. None of the actors had what was necessary to carry this off. I don't know whether I could take the dissappointment I know is waiting in the next and hopefully final episode.",0

I was also shocked behond belief with Lucas including a scene with yoda fighting. I mean i love star wars but i think that this new film and the first film are not doing the overall story credit. I for one preferred the muppit yoda cos frankly i think the computer generated one sucks. I was very pleased to see Christopher Lee in this film as i think he is a wonderful actor and i hope he is also in the 3rd film, i also was impressed with a certain scottish actor who redeems himself after a disappointing first outing as the jedi master. I thought the younger members of the cast also did well, though i found the love scenes a bit poor.

Jango Fett is totally awesome and by the end of the movie you totally believe that Boba would follow in his footsteps. Mace Windu finally gets to show why he's a Jedi Master, and Yoda..you just have to see for yourself. There are just so many cool scenes in this movie I don't have time to list them all.

I found Star Wars: Episode II to be as confusing as Episode I. The genius which Lucas had drawn from the works of Joseph Campbell in the 1970s is highly lacking in the new episodes. Maybe it's for the simple fact that one has no interest in relating to any of the characters in the movie because there is no true hero and no real character involvement. Though George pushes for it, we all know where Anakin is headed and we are loathe to identify with this future traitor. The glory of the first Star Wars trilogy lay largely in the hero, Luke, who embodies the noblest and most ideal qualities of humanity.  Luke Skywalker inspired the audience with his naivete, integrity, growing wisdom, lofty idealism, and his eventual journey towards Jedi glory.  The viewer lived out Luke's experiences vicariously.

1589,6.0,"Brilliant Images and terrific sound, even more so if you see it in a digital theater, help bring this film to life. Therein lies the fault. this film, despite all its wonderful technological Prowess, ultimately yields a HIGHLY unsatisfying experience for the viewer.The film's attempts at humor go overboard, and the style grows quickly stale. The History, such as it is, is presented as well as can be expected, but, there are times when I, at least, couldn't help but think that it seems as if LUCAS has tinkered with what has already been established.Looking at the story, what little there is, one YEARNS for the middle chapter of the first trilogy, one wants the WONDER of A NEW HOPE, the CAREFREE attitude of RETURN OF THE JEDI. You will not find that here. Instead, you get Anakin Skywalker, whom from the older films, we know will one day become known as DARTH Vader, reduced to a typical teen suffering the WHINIEST form of angst. Even the Defining moment in the Film, Which serves to let the Viewer see the EXACT turning point in his life, is a bit of a letdown, due mainly to the fact that HAYDEN Christensen, who portrays him, has next to no acting ability. He is in fact, as banal as Jake Lloyd, who performed the role in PHANTOM MENACE, and once more, Natalie Portman shows that, while a Beauty, she cannot overcome her surroundings, and NEVER once rises above the material or her on-screen partners. Even R2-D2 and C3po are given short shrift. Yes, they play a somewhat larger part in this, but, what screen-time they get is wasted. Christopher Lee, always a marvelously Unique actor, seems uncomfortable in his role. EVEN YODA seems to have problems....Quite a feat, considering it is an entirely DIGITAL creation. The annoying JAR JAR BINKS....and this may be considered a spoiler, it may not, plays a VASTLY reduced role....yet one cannot help but get the impression that, perhaps LUCAS, if not winking at himself, which HE COULD be, I suppose, is rather, stuffing the atrocity down our collective throats once more? but, I digress. The point is, If you love Star wars, see it. If you love Star Wars, know it is not what it used to be.

Cast was great and there were enough subplots to keep an active mind busy.  I want to watch this several more times today, but first.....MUST SLEEP.  I stood in line for 6 hours for the best seat in the house (which I got) and it was worth every second.  Can no one understand the passion behind waiting for something really great?  I was so amazed at this movie.  I came in with high expectations, very excited, and even so, my ever wish was fulfilled, I couldn't have asked for more.  George Lucas has outdone himself again.

Lucas has also done a good job this time around of giving us our fill of cool saber fights. Needless to say, when I saw the movie last night people were cheering during the last fight.

1594,5.0,"There are some films that go beyond their genre, becoming something greater, something that nearly anyone can enjoy, with powerful performances and excellent writing and directing.  The Sixth Sense.  Gone With the Wind.  As Good as it Gets.  The original Star Wars Trilogy.  The Matrix.  Films that may not be without flaws, but nevertheless are an inspiration to watch. Star Wars Episode II is not one of those films.  It is a sci-fi film...that's all.  As those things go, it's certainly decent enough, and definitely worth watching, but it isn't anything particularly special. Anyway, here ends the comparison to other films, and begins my commentary on this one alone. ""Attack of the Clones"" is, largely, the story of Anakin Skywalker's coming of age, and his difficulties in dealing with his love for Amidala and the subtle manipulations of Palpatine as he learns the ways of the Jedi from his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi--who he believes is holding him back.  This is set against the larger story of the political troubles of the Republic, which is faced with a terrible choice between watching planets split off and destroy the unity that once was or fighting those that rebel and watching the destruction arise even quicker as they destroy the very principles upon which it is based.  And at the head of it all is Palpatine, a scheming mastermind who uses all the others, from senator to Jedi, like pieces in a chess game.  It's a great setup, and could lead to an excellent plot. Unfortunately, it's derailed early on in the film...in part, due to the performances given by some of the actors.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are the focus of a great part of the film as Anakin and Amidala...and come off as very flat.  The emotions they portray seem false...as though, really, they were just trying too hard.  It doesn't help that the writing for their many scenes is generally overdone, with the lines written in such a way that they simply can't be said in a natural manner. There are a great many scenes between the two in the film, and each has very little true point being there...it would've been far better to have fewer scenes, with more meaning in each. What is so unusual about this film is that it really seems to have been written and directed by two different people.  By contrast to the Anakin/Amidala parts, the Obi-Wan parts of the film are quite excellent, extremely entertaining and filled with neat plot points and stellar performances by just about everyone involved.  Ewan McGregor, in particular, does an amazing job of portraying Obi-Wan, exactly as he should be portrayed, and brings the character to life in a way few actors can.  His parts of the film save it, easily...though they perhaps also make the Anakin/Amidala parts more depressing to sit through, because of the stark contrast.  It's really very odd. I have several problems with various parts of the movie's plot.  Most, probably unsurprisingly, fall within the Anakin/Amidala parts of the film. I won't comment on most of them, because often it'd spoil parts of the movie for those who haven't seen it...but I will comment on one thing.  *SPOILER WARNING* Anakin's attack on the Tusken Raiders was horribly handled--in my opinion, the attack should not have happened in this film, especially not if it is going to be ignored for most of the rest of the movie, outside of one single scene.  I'm not saying that it should've been the focus of the rest of the film, but the writing seemed to suggest that watchers are expected to look at Anakin in the same way they always have...when he's just slaughtered an entire camp, men, women, AND children.  *END SPOILER* In any case, ""Attack of the Clones"" is worth watching, if only to form your own opinion on the film.  It was certainly entertaining, which is all I really ask for when I go to a movie...but in the end, it is only a decent sci-fi action film, that had so much potential to be better--not because of the Star Wars name, but because of the honestly great idea for the general plot. Oh, yes, I also feel obligated to mention that Yoda is great.",1

I admire the complex universe George Lucas has created, and can completely understand how it has captured the imagination of it's legions of fans, after all it goes without saying this film franchise was a milestone for modern cinema.

He can't use the force to track a bounty hunter in the 2Fast2Stupid race sequence, he can't use the force to outrun her, and he can't use the force to find her in a crowded pub.

Listen, Star Wars has always had comic book dialogue, this one is no different.  The love story is a little weak, but it is a small part of this movie.  For Star Wars fans, the thrill of seeing the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin, the creation of the Clone-troopers,  and the breathtaking action is enough to make everyone forget the dissapointing Episode 1.  And there is one scene that everyone should go in knowing absolutely nothing about, but alas, most reviewers seem compelled to spill the beans on what is one of the most thrilling sequences in Star Wars history.  I knew of this scene before going in, and wished I hadn't.  Spoiler free for Episode 3 is my motto now.  So Star Wars fans, our series is alive and well and 3 years from now it all comes to and end.

In this case, not only is the screenplay poorly written and the acting terrible, but the story elements themselves make absolutely no sense.

I've heard that there was some chemistry between the two of them off-screen, but it certainly wasn't apparent in the film. Natalie Portman's performance wasn't really any better than that of her co-star.

1625,,"I used to believe that you couldn't have too much of a good thing. Now I'm not so sure. In the latest installment of the STAR WARS saga, creator George Lucas does his best to raise the bar yet again in the area of special effects. While his technical accomplishments here are undeniably impressive, the film falls short of being perfect. I've seen this film twice now, and given a considerable amount of thought to what sort of opinions I'd express about it. I'm not looking to upset anyone with my statements, so please consider this as nothing more than one person's perspective. That said, our story opens with Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly Queen Amidala, arriving on the giant city-planet of Coruscant. After an attempt is made on her life, it is deemed necessary by the powers that be to have Jedi protection assigned to her. The Senator's old friend Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is called upon, escorted by his student Anakin (Hayden Christensen), who is all grown up and eager to see Padme after so many years apart. Their arrival to assist the Senator is met with pleasure, but Anakin quickly realizes his feelings for Padme are stronger than expected. After a second attempt on her life, members of the Jedi council decide to begin an investigation to find those responsible. Anakin is told to protect Padme, while Obi-Wan searches for some answers elsewhere. Thus begins two journeys, and two continuing storylines that will carry us through the rest of the film. Anakin must deal with his love for Padme, which is forbidden by his beliefs, and unacceptable for a woman in her position. During his quest for the Senator's assassin, Obi-Wan discovers a plot much more complicated than anyone imagined. A clone army is being created under the supposed authorization of the Jedi council.

Indeed some of the critics most in tune with the dark side would almost make you believe this movie was in the league of ""Plan 9 from outer space"".  Don't take the quicker and more seductive route that they did, for This is a very good movie striving to make the prequel trilogy reach the same level of greatness that the original trilogy attained.  It didn't quite achieve that for me but I can see the effort and the promise for Episode III.  I greatly look forward to the final chapter, and in the meantime will watch this want multiple times in the theater and on DVD.  I love the performances of Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.  The love story did not detract at all and there was humor to be found in it.

Fans of the series will love seeing more back story revealed (meeting Boba Fett's father, seeing C3P0 and R2D2 first teaming up, seeing the first plans for the Death Star, meeting the aunt and uncle who will raise Luke), watching Anakin slowing changing to what will become the Dark Lord himself, and a cool battle between the Jedis and their new enemies. But too many flat spots, sprinkled with flat acting, scenes that reminded me of ""Blade Runner,"" and pedestrian dialogue, grounded this latest installment on an earthly plane. When the action finally comes, the film is over and I felt cheated.

1638,10.0,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is, contrary to popular belief, is a great film. Unlike many, I do not compare it to other Star Wars movies to judge the movie as a whole. Obviously nothing can top the original Star Wars, whether how good the movie is or not. Episode II is wonderfully directed, written well for Star Wars (reality writing isn't what Star Wars wants), okay acting (Portman was a disappointment), awesome special effects, and much more. It lived up to the Star Wars name just like Phantom Menace did three years before. This time, it had more violence and more lightsaber action, and less Jar Jar Binks... Thank god. This movie had a lot of good and bad points that showed throughou the film. The good, was the world that Lucas formed- it felt as if the viewer was inside that life, Ahhhh the beauty of Science Fiction! The action scenes were quite intense and groundbreaking, most of which were high scale war scenes that never had been used before. Yeah, so what if they were fighting in blue screens? Do you really think Lucas would show a war with people dressed up as droids? Yeah he'd have to find thousands of people for that. Hayden Christensen did a wonderful job as Anakin Skywalker and so did Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi- who really showed off his jedi knowledge and power in this movie, as well as his acting. Christopher Lee (The Man with the Golden Gun) also did a good job as the villian; rarely do you see a grounded villian who is not savage and at peace with himself. That is the best villian you can have in a movie and that's why Lee as Count Dooku survived.  Unlike the Phantom Menace, Episode II failed not to make you fall asleep, but to take nothing away from Phantom Menace, the 1st Star Wars (Episode Four) does make you fall asleep at times. Lastly, when Yoda came in, it was not only funny but very entertaining. I won't give away much more, but Yoda definitely is my sunshine. Now to the bad points. The Romance between Anakin and Senator Amidala was way too childish. Childish is alright, but this love was like 1st grade love. One scene Anakin acts jealous because of a boy Amidala was with and another scene Anakin acted like he was hurt and rolled and played with Amidala in the grass. O how sweet. It would of been nice if the love story was built up a little bit more- that was like the second scene with the two together in there newly found attraction. Plus, every time it cut back to the soon to be couple, they were at a different romantic location. Is this the Travel Channel or something? Also, one actress who failed to make a good stand was Natalie Portman who did a bad job, I think, as Senator Amidala. Hayden had all the chemistry to fuel his relationship with Amidala, and even together, it looked like Hayden was the only one driven on pure energy on love. Amidala looked like she was loving him as a friend, more than anything else. But the romance wasn't the only problem, as Portman just didn't ""feel"" her role so to speak. Overall, great movie. Relax and enjoy your time at the theater. This is not a kids movie like many people believe; this is a teenage flick and should be watched anyways regardless of your age. It brings back the forgotten age of the passion of Star Wars and leaves you drooling for the next installment Episode III.",1

The future dark lord of the Sith is reduced to a whiny hormonal teenager in this film. In fairness Christensen doesn't have much to work with here as this script is infamous for having cringey 'Romantic' dialogue. This is most present after Padme (Natalie Portman) seemingly falls in love with Anakin after he describes his hatred of sand to her. On top of this the plot feels disjointed to say the least, as we hop back and forth from Anakin and Padme's misadventures to Obi-Wan's (Ewan McGregor) time on Kamino. As Obi-Wan is an infinitely more interesting character this goes some way to diverting our attention from the intended leads in Anakin and Padme. This all leads us to the third act on the planet of Geonosis as the film reaches it's climax as the Rebublic's army of super soldiers knows as 'the clones' arrives and saves countless Jedi from being executed in an arena. From there we witness a lightsaber duel between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda and Count Dooku. This is Arguably the only good part of the film. Eventually the droids are defeated and forced to retreat and the Jedi prevail. Overall not a bad film with definite entertainment value but a cringe romantic subplot and a uneven sequence makes for potentially a tough film to watch.",0

1645,,"I was disappointed with Lucas's previous movie Phantom of the Menace as I found it to be flat with a slow development of the storyline. Lucas used a new approach to this movie and wastes no time in getting the audience straight into the action. You can almost compare this movie with those of James Bond where a simple storyline is woven with lavish settings, visuals and actions. There are some spectacular scenes of cities and locations shot on the various planets but the overall feel appears slightly artificial. The alien characters  also appear animated and not as lifelike as one would have expected. Acting is also somewhat sub standard and was particularly disappointed with Samuel Jackson's somewhat muted performance. However, performances by the old veteran Christopher Lee and the voice of Yoda (Frank Oz) lifted this movie. There seemed to be an urgency in the film as the scenes were shot in quick succession in various locations and so tended to depart away from the central theme of the story. Normally the musical score gets unnoticed in most epics but in this case it appeared more pronounced which could be argued as good or bad. The intimate relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padme Amidala was tackled early in the movie with the premise that that the Star Wars saga will continue.   The final battle scenes was by far the best part of the movie. The complex mechanics of machinery, robots, humans and aliens battling on the desert was very well captured on screen. Like all good spirited action movies we see the supreme republican members of the council also engaged in hand to hand combat. Stunning visuals with good actions are let down by a weak cast but entertaining to watch nevertheless.",0

1648,3.0,"I saw this twice in theaters, three times on DVD with little desire to see it again. It was the movie that I was hoping was going to bring Stars Wars back to the prequels... what I got was a very fabricated attempt to fill in the time between episodes I & III. There is little of anything of real significance going on here... nothing meaningful, just mostly filler to tie the audience over until Episode III was released. The last time I saw this film I became so bored I really was tempted to just press the stop button.<br /><br />From a film making point of view it is okay. It lacks that Star Wars sense of realism - which is due to heavy use of CGI. I don't consider this movie as having good special effects (strange to say for a Star Wars movie), the Phantom Menace was better in that regard. The acting is certainly not great. The whole movie feels like ""let's just try and get this one out of the way."" you know, a lack of real passion for what they were making.<br /><br />I think non Stars Wars fans may enjoy this film more than the fans. It's really hard for me to try and say anything that positive about this film, after watching interviews I think George Lucas knew this wasn't a good film and why it wasn't really given any real huge media blitz upon release. He tried to say the movie failed because people don't like romance... which I think is merely an excuse for making a terrible movie.<br /><br />Okay, spoiler, the number one thing that gripes me about this movie is the ending. Why would 10,000 Jedi, with the Force as their ally, need clone troopers?

I saw a midnight showing last night and almost had problems staying awake at times. Sure, the visual effects were stunning (with almost too much going on in the backgrounds), but this was the most poorly acted of the 5 films.  Hayden Christensen (""Anakin Skywalker""), Sam Jackson (""Mace Windu""), and Christopher Lee (""Darth Tyranus"") sound like they are reading lines right off of cue cards.  And there are WAY too many love (or, 'pre-love') scenes between Anakin and Amidala.  I know that's a huge part of the entire story, but I found them sooo boring.  Some of the light-saber fights are good, but many other scenes were unintendedly funny (like Yoda fighting Darth Tyranus).  C-3PO is hilarious - probably the most redeemable character in the film, though Ewan McGregor does a good job as ""Obi-Wan""...   After the film we all discussed how this was too similar to ""Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Gladiator"" (I kept waiting for Russell Crowe to pop up in that scene).  I will say that Lucas does plant the seeds for Episode III very well, as everything will be connected between the trilogies in 3 years. At least Jar Jar's role was limited in this one...   Overall I'd rank this one 3rd (behind 'Empire' and the original) and give it a 6 or 7/10.  Maybe if I see it a few more times (I'm sure I will), it will improve in my eyes.

If this film is any indication of what is to come, then it can be safely said that George Lucas has lost his magic touch.   Episode II, without question, is an incredibly exciting movie to watch and, if you don't employ any critique, is a most enjoyable film. But if you do choose to employ your skills as a critic, and if you can get past the incredible special effects, you see what is essentially an average movie with very bland dialogue and monotonous acting. As a dedicated Star Wars fan, I was disappointed by this latest attempt at reviving the phenomenon. On the credit side, this film makes wonderful use of computer animation and special effects.

The odd clunker of dialogue and stale delivery aside, this is strong, satisfying stuff.

There is a shade of darkness with the beginnings of the empire and certain events that trigger the darkness that lurks deep in Anakin. In the end it boils down to one thing: entertainment.

""Clones"" is the heavyweight CGI champion of all time.  After seeing it you will say to yourself: ""Now they can do anything, ANYTHING, they want on film.""

However let us break it down. The Primary reason behind EP.II. Was to show the growing Love between Anakin and Padme. Yes I admit George is a great Sci-Fi Writer/Director. His ability to write and Direct love scenes is not the greatest. But who really sees a SW Movie for the Love Story. Did the Clumsy Dialoge and Predictable Romance Ruin the Movie. NO! The story progressed as promised. Let's look at the fun behind this Movie. First the speeder chase through the skies of Couroscant. That was adventure at it's finest. The battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Awesome and even better than that. OF course, when Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme face the Beasts. That was a little to reminiscent of the '50's TV Serials. However it was something new for the SW saga. Then when the Jedi arena battle begins. Welcome to Star Wars!!!! Jedi fighting in battle, I have waited My whole life for this scene and they got it just right. Then the Clone Wars Officially Begin, the Clones attack and the battle is on. These two scenes are two of the best visuals I have ever seen. It made me want to go home, Take out my vintage Star Wars figures and play with them all over again. Now to the detractors. Really is the movie as bad as you say, or are you really a Brokeback Mountain fan. Come clean now. This movie is Star Wars.

There are a few humorous moments, and the FX, while overused, are still incredible, but even the few 'cool' parts of PM are missing in AOTC. Thankfully JJ's screen time (I can't even type the tards name without retching) is minimal, sadly he was replaced by a more annoying character - Anakin Skywalker, grown up and lacking any characteristics of a Tenderfoot Jedi. If it truly is such a strict order, they would have booted him off about 10 minutes into the movie.

It had similar flaws to 'Menace', but at least 'Menace' was exiting. Count Dooko wasn't half as cool as darth Maul, and the lightsaber sequences between anakin, obi-wan and count dooko, weren't as fast and gripping as Darth Maul vs. obi-wan and Qui-gon in Episode 1.The brilliant song, Duel of the Fates from episode 1's Darth Maul fight wasn't heard in the lightsaber scene at the end of episode 2, but when anakin was riding a speeder.........WHAT THE @#$#*#!!!!

He also managed to jettison cutesy Jake Lloyd.",1
1688,8.0,"I'll start by saying that I am not one of those that was disappointed with Episode One.  I didn't expect it to be as good as the classic trilogy, and was satisfied with what Lucas delivered back in '99.  Yes, Jar Jar Binks was annoying, but he certainly didn't come close to ruining the film for me. That said, I expected more from Episode 2.  I think many of us were expecting Episode 2 to be a big step up from one, as Lucas didn't have to introduce every character this time around.  I expected more action, a more substantive story, and less sentimentality/""feel good"" scenes.  Lucas did deliver on the latter; this movie is certainly the ""darkest"" Star Wars since Empire Strikes Back.  Not only is Binks' role much reduced, but equally annoying (to me) C3PO doesn't get much screen time either.  The problem with Episode 2 is that the plot isn't much to right home about.  In my opinion, the foundation for the establishment of the galactic empire could (and should) have been presented in a much better way than what Clones delivers. The acting simply isn't very good.  Ewan McGregor has the distinct look of a #2 guy to me.  He was fine as Liam Neeson's sidekick in Episode 1, but in my opinion isn't leading man material.  Hayden Christenson's Anakin Skywalker is far more interesting and compelling than the child actor from Episode 1, but isn't likely to garner many acting awards for his work here either.  I must admit that I was much happier with Natalie Portman this time around. Relieved of her ridiculous costumes from Episode 1, she was much improved this time.  What this movie really lacked was a strong villain.  There is no dashing Darth Maul around this time.  The lightsaber battle between Maul and Qui-Gon/Obi Wan from episode one is easily the best combat sequence I've ever seen in a movie.  It is not repeated here.  The fight scenes between Jengo Fett and the jedi are good, but not nearly as memorable.  Overall, I think Episode 2 will be the least successful of the Star Wars movies.  It is taking harsh criticism.  While this will not deter anyone that is a legitimate Star Wars fan from seeing it, I do believe that this film will suffer (when compared to the previous films) at the box office, because many fans will be unsatisfied to the point of seeing it only once, rather than returning several times.  It is a good movie, but ""good"" just doesn't cut it when Star Wars is concerned.  I believe we have a right to expect more than Episode 2 delivered.",0

1720,1.0,christopher lee is the only person involved in this film - who was not an utter disgrace. Lee's performance was great. The rest of the cast should be ritually slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods and as a warning to those who follow - at the next Academy Awards.,0
1721,3.0,A great technical achievement but I most admit I have no interest in the characters or story at all. I find the movie incredibly boring except for the amazing effects scenes. Everytime a human face appeared i was disappointed. Too many sub plots and a total lack of innovation in the story. There is some good acting in it but the actual dialogue is mostly rubbish. I've completely lost interest in the star wars franchise now. The original star wars was story led. Empire had the great snowspeeder battle scenes and still a pretty good story line. Return of the Jedi again was a little bit worse for story at least and really now the story is just poor padding between the effects.,0
1722,7.0,"I cannot say this was better than Episode I.  If you like space battles, the one at the end of Episode I is better than anything here.  If you like lightsaber battles, the one between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul in Episode one is more intense and spirited than anything here (Yoda's duel is impressive, no doubt, but lasts nowhere near as long as it should). It is interesting to see a lot of Jedi wielding their lightsabers in combat...but they only chop down those pathetic-looking battle droids. Ho-hum.",0

1724,9.0,"When the credits rolled the first time I saw The Phantom Menace, my first thought was it would be three long years before I got to see the next installment.  Now that installment is here, and it is everything I was waiting for.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  The acting was a wonderful improvement over its predecessor, and Hayden Christensen stole the show.  I was captivated by his portrayal of a man teetering on the edge.  But all the characters, not just Anakin, seemed more real this time around.  The story is much more emotionally charged in Attack of the Clones, and the film itself is an action movie, love story, whodunnit mystery and a story of deep personal conflict all rolled into one.  The special effects are fantastic, it being a Lucas joint and all, but what makes this film such a marked improvement over The Phantom Menace is that the storyline, not the CGI, really drives the film.  This movie offers something for everyone of all ages and is well worth the price admission (several times, at that).  Its only drawback is that now I have to wait ANOTHER three long years to find out how the whole story comes to a close.",1

1728,10.0,"I am amazed by how many critics just don't understand the Star Wars story! This latest episode delivered almost 100%.  What a whirlwind!  To watch Anakin descending from innocence to darkness was spellbinding!  And his love for Padme overwhelming, to say the least.  The only thing wrong in the movie, to me anyway, was that George Lucas could've spent a little more time delving in to that growing relationship.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman clicked so well together that I couldn't take my eyes off of them. And it sure looks to me like Obi-Wan and the Jedi Masters are screwing up Anakin's training.  No one seems to want to listen to him!  When he is having his nightmares and Obi-Wan tells him that ""dreams pass in time"" I want to shake him and yell, ""Wake UP!!!!  He's having visions, you idiot!""",1
1729,10.0,"In Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, we did not see the remnants of the George Lucas that we were used to and hoping for.  The storyline was ok, but not enough good acting and too much CGI.  Also, perhaps, Lucas was just a little rusty doing the whole ""movie thing.""  But lest we dwell on the past and observe our present and look forward to the future....(especially 2005 when Star Wars Episode 3 comes out!).  In Attack of the Clones, Lucas has generated a movie masterpiece.  He worked with an excellent and perfectly fitting cast that carries you through the movie, from start to finish. This is a VERY complex movie, and I get headaches trying to imagine how Lucas was able to put this together.  The story is curious, compelling, and complex; a perfect combination for modern film.  I was disapointed with Phantom Menace, and was reluctant to see Attack of the Clones (because of the failed first attempt), but after seeing Attack of the Clones (3 times), I cannot wait to see Episode 3.  This film was not just a movie, it is a work of art and true genius.  Great job Lucas! -chaz",1
1730,,"Remember Tron? That movie about the guy getting stuck inside a video game? I'll bet the actors in this drivel feel a lot like that.  Clones should win an Academy Award -- the new Best Animated Feature award.  But at least the backgrounds ARE animated -- unlike the stiff playing Annakin.  As for the CGI techniques, I can only say that as flat as this looked on the big screen, it's going to look even worse on TV, where you can see everything at once.  But I'm looking forward to the next one, in which I've heard that Justin Timberlake will play Annakin and nobody will play Obi Wan -- they'll just scan a bunch of old Alec Guiness movies, computer de-age him, and walk him around like the dead president robots at Disneyland.  And that movie will finally answer the fateful question:  Why does Vader wear a helmet?  In fact, it has nothing to do with keeping him alive or helping him breath.  He simply doesn't want to be recognized as the annoying youths of Episodes I and II.  Unless there's a Wookie in #III, I'm walking.",0
1731,6.0,"Although it is a better film than its shallow predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"" still strangely lacks the brilliant direction and strong characterization of George Lucas' work of old. It succeeds better not because of a tighter plot (it isn't) or better acting (it's not), but probably because of the arrival and added depth of a more mature Anakin Skywalker. Although slightly wooden, the older Hayden Christensen brings somewhat more to the role than the much younger Jake Lloyd in ""Phantom Menace"".",1

Be ready for the best of the movie when Yoda has a little surprise. the trade Federation is back and much cooler than in the Phantom Menace.  I love the insect dudes.  All of Camino is great.  Finding ou t the origens of the Storm Troopers is a pleasure and Christopher Lee plays a great villain. It is fun to unravel the building of the Death Star.  jango Fett is almost as good as Boba.  Mace Windu kicks butt.  Get ready for the Clone Wars have begun.",1
1733,10.0,Very good come back from George Lucas and very expected. The actors are very good and the music also. The film explains the rest and I hope it will continue. Very good movie that I saw. The actors are the key for the movie because without them the movie wouldn't work. Thank you again for the superb movie.,1
1734,,"Ha Ha! You know, I wasn't expecting too much out of this film, but I was pleasantly surprised I will admit.  Breathtaking visuals, art direction and the story goes somewhere.  The acting is good, even with the one-liners and whininess of Anakin Skywalker.  You know, overall, I think Hayden Christensen did a good job.  I mean come on, admit it.  He was fine. It was the whining of his character that bothered me.  Whining about Amidala, whining about how jealous Obi-Wan was of him.  I mean there is only so much I can take.  I'm very thankful that the film is 142 minutes so all that was spaced out. Natalie Portman as Senator Amidala also gave a good acting performance. She wasn't to bit*** and you saw enough of her to be satisfied.  What I didn't like about her character was that she was so reluctant to give in to Anakin. Even though it was obvious that she wanted him.  I mean come on! Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan was good as usual...I wasn't expecting anything less of him and I wasn't left disappointed.  Same with Samuel L. Jackson, whom I like, but whose character and battle scenes are short-lived. I kind of wanted to see more of him. You saw him enough I will admit, and he interacted well with the other characters, but I wanted more of him as well as Yoda. Despite all that, which seems more than enough to hate the film, the action and the quasi-romance scenes make up all together. I've seen it twice and I plan on seeing it again. Period.",1

1737,8.0,"Like many fans, I was sorely disappointed with Episode one.  So much so, that I wasn't too interested in seeing this one.  A friend talked me into it, and it was worth it!  This movie is as far above Episode I as Episode I was below the originals!  Epic battle scenes, that unfortunately will be criticized by the same people who criticized the CG battle in Fellowship of the Ring.  My only complaint, and it isn't really fair, is that all of the vehicles (although they do begin to resemble the vehicles used in Episode IV, as logic should expect)look more advanced than the vehicles that replace them (ie., in Episode IV and beyond).  I know, I know, no one wants to see a movie made in 2002 that uses technology from the 1970's.  But if I'm designing vehicles for a movie supposedly set BEFORE the original, I'd see it as a challenge to make them look interesting, but becoming obsolete, to be replaced by the next generation (which happens to be 25 years older). Fans who felt they wasted their money on Episode I will not feel that way with this one.  The Yoda fight scene alone was worth the money!  Yoda kicks BUTT! Gets around pretty good for a decrepit old...er...man.",0
1738,10.0,The great thing about this movie is how Lucas made everything fit into place and didn't make the technology more advance as the later years.  It is very unique in the history and description of the Jedi.  I liked this movie as well as the other 4 and can't wait to see the next one.  This is one of my favorite movies.  Star Wars creates its own genre because it is a lot more entertainable than any other sci-fi movies.  I truly think everyone should see it.,1
1739,10.0,"Well I was one of the first to see this movie (At 12:01) , and I thought that it was truly breathtaking. The visual effects were beautiful. The music score was wonderful. You could easily portray in your mind what was happening without the picture, the music was that good. The acting was great too. I see why Robin Gurland and George Lucas chose Christensen for the role. The Chemistry between Portman and Christensen was there, you could easily sense it. Though it does not rival the chemistry between Ford and Fischer in Episode V and Episode VI. The movie kept you attentive the whole time, except for when back on Naboo. Fortunately that was made up for with Obi Wan's troubles. As if  the whole movie wasn't good enough, the last 30 minutes completely astonished me. Everywhere something was happening, lightsabers were swishing all about, millions of weaponfire, and explosions that left you speechless. Ending the movie, I thought that the confrontation with Dooku was wonderful. The agility shown between the fights was amazing. Then with the Yoda fight, that was truly amazing. He moved so quickly and proved his character to be truly powerful, instead of the normal walking around on a  cane. The end is very chilling, having the imperial music as Darth Tyrannus and Sidious meet. Especially with the views of the millions of Clone troopers. Then finally the most chilling is seeing the wedding, and seeing Anakin's new arm. (I thought that it would have been more like Luke's hand.) In conclusion, this movie was spectacular. 10/10",1
1740,10.0,"This movie gives a lot of fun. Don´t disappoint to the people that aren´t fans and for the fans that loves the Star Wars universe, this movie is a beautiful present that is wrap in the best technology of visual effects together a beautiful story of the human condition.",1
1741,10.0,This is by far the best Star Wars of them all.  It was very good and the special effects were fantastic.  The part I probably enjoyed the most was the fact that Yoda got to fight with a light saber.  He moves so fast and it is very entertaining.  When he pulled out the lightsaber everyone in the audience starting cheering.  If anything you should see this movie as soon as possible.  It is literally one of my favorite movies of all time.,1
1742,10.0,"Star Wars: Episode 2-Attack of the Clones can be summarized in two words: AWE....SOME!  I absolutely love this film.  After being not so satisfied with the attempt of The Phantom Menace to bring back the Magic of the Force to the People, I welcomed this spectacular venture back into the mythos of what is Star Wars.  Watching the descent of Anakin Skywalker to the Darker Side of the Force was exquisite.  Hayden's portrayal of Anakin could not have been done better.  Padme was welcome eye-candy and a bit more fiesty this time around.  At least, now I see where Leia gets her attitude from. Mostly what made Episode 2 more like a Star Wars film was the rejoining of the droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO.  Seeing those two back together again(coverings and all) made it feel like one of the Original Trilogy films. The story was great, it answered a lot of questions for me and kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  I appreciate all the ""hidden eastereggs"" that have become well known throughout all of Lucas' films. This is definitely a Movie you could watch over and over again and never get bored, because there is always something new to see.",1

You cant compare totally different films it's just impossible to do, you can say which you enjoyed the most but don't rank the films in a table.  My advice to anyone who doesn't know what to think of it is, don't listen to anyone else just judge it as a stand alone film.",1
1746,10.0,"Many fans may have been disappointed with The Phantom Menace (not me though) and hated the character Jar Jar Binks (again, not me) or Jake Lloyd's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker (yup, you guessed my opinion). The film was also too dry and impersonal (okay, you got me there). Let me just say that I feared the worst for Attack of the Clones. I was disappointed when the title was announced. I was disappointed when I saw the first teaser. I was disappointed when I saw the ""Forbidden Love""-trailer. I started to show slight interest again when I saw the ""Clone Wars""-trailer. So I went to see this with a minimum of expectations - some sort of ""Pearl Harbor"" in space, let's say. Boy, was I WRONG! The love story didn't annoy me one bit, as I thought it would. At the beginning, when Ani's love remains unanswered, I felt sorry for him. When Ani and Padmé are driven into the arena near the end, I felt tearing up inside at the (hokey, but so heart-warmingly delivered) line: ""Every day since I saw you again, a part of me has died. I truly, deeply love you."" Poor Padmé. I felt so bad for her, especially knowing what'll happen to her love in EpIII. Obi-Wan was, as we say in Ebonics, the illest (great, entertaining and loveable performance, as usual, by our man Ewan). Temuera Morrison was a likeable villain in the role of Jango Fett and Christopher Lee felt like one of the old-time Star Wars villains - which is positive, of course. Samuel L. Jackson was - as usual - a BAD ASS MOTHAF***A! Heads up, Jango! Yoda shows us why he's the Master (terrific contrasts: in the beginning of the film he makes jokes in front of his little Padawans at Obi-Wans expense and praises the innocence of children and at the end, he just totally whupps ""Matrix""-style ass!) And watch out for Hayden Christensen's positively Pacino-esque ""I hate them!""-monologue. Powerful the dark side has become indeed. Let's hope it remains that way for Episode III.",0
1747,8.0,"When C3PO loses his head and it ends up next to his body, he mutters ""I'm beside myself!""  That's a pretty good line.  I think there may have been another good line too, but nothing like the wry wit that was evident in episodes 4, 5 and 6.  I basically have the same complaint in this movie I had in Spiderman.  The CGI isn't all that good.  When Yoda is fighting, it looks as if a green rag is flopping around.  Slow it down and show us some technique, instead of dazzling us with speed. The light sabre fights between Luke and Darth Vader were much better.  On a happier note, Obi-Wan's character is right on, totally excellent. Anakin's role is that of a teenager ruled by hormones that get in his way. He has some interesting glares and looks, and his face is expressive.  I liked that, but to this point, I still see no motivation for him to go to the dark side.  Any warrior must know that he will have some disappointments in life, and Anakin doesn't seem to get it. Christopher Lee looked like he was watching CGI, his eyes didn't focus at all like they did in 'Lord of the Rings' when he battled Gandalf. This movie will appeal to the 15 to 30 age set, and that is wonderful.  I applaud Lucas for continuing the series and sticking to his themes, after all, if he hadn't started this, we would all be without many computer advances and interesting characters.  However, I do miss the pacing and characterizations of the 'earlier' episodes. I rated it an 8, but I was hoping for a 9.",0
1748,8.0,"I really, really enjoyed this flick and I think Lucas has tapped onto what the people want to see. Epsiode I was, in my opinion, a great film too because it was a political intrigue thriller, showing a politician's desire to be master of all he surveys, which is alot in the Star Wars universe!! All those who talk about it being stupid, not up to the level of the previous episodes need to look at it for what it was- the beginning of the story that is complex and complicated.",1
1749,10.0,"Seeing this movie was a pleasure. It was surprisingly nothing like episode one in all of its flaws. See it for action. See it for romance. See it for Natalie Portman.

1751,,"I already commented on this movie, but the more I think about it the worse it seems. I cannot even accept this as a star wars movie. This movie is just absolute crap. There is not one good thing about. First of all the acting is terrible. Hayden Christensen was such a terrible pick for Anakin. He was the last person that should've been picked. Natalie Portman was a lot better than Hayden, but she still has plenty of room for improvement. Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan Mcgregor were pretty much the only good actors. Now on to the dialouge. The dialouge is usually the worst part the of Star Wars movies and it is atrocious in this movie. To top it all off, there was almost less of a plot in this movie than in episode one. Basically everything in this movie couldn't have been handled in a worse way. The movie would be slightly better if Mace Windu fought Dooku instead of Yoda. Like I said in my other review the Yoda fight scene is laughable. Umm, why the heck would Yoda need a cane if the next minute he bopping and jumping impossibly well? I have to give this movie a bad review because it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and George Lucas really needs to get someone else to write the dialouge. In episode five he had someone else do the dialouge and that is the best of the whole saga. To finish this movie is abysmal. 1/10",0
1752,,*Minor Spoiler* George Lucas continues to ruin the star wars saga. This just isn't a good movie. First of all and most annoying the dialogue sucks.

1753,5.0,"The first half of this movie is the worst Star Wars yet (except for Obi-Wan's visit to the clone planet).  The second half is better, at times MUCH better and has sequences as good as the first two.  But that first half is SO SO SO SO SO bad.  Better FX than Episode I but is still looks like Shrek some of the time.  William's worst score of the bunch.  If they recast Padme and Anakin for the last movie I would not be upset.  Maybe if they got a good writer and directer too.",0

1762,9.0,"Well folks, I have just returned from the premiere here in Riga and if I might say it in one word - THE FILMS IS FANTASTIC. The early critics and press that said that the force is STRONG with this one were right! Completely! Or Almost... But first the good bits: A) The film completely satisfies both in term of action, eye candy and just everything you hear and see. B) It's definately stronger than PHANTOM MENACE and it really shows to a die hard STAR WARS fan, what a good star wars movie can be. This film definately worth seeing. I try to avoid spoilers, but there were just everything you, a star wars fan need: lots of action, cool fx, the scale of everything is fantastic, the love story behind is great. You'll love the moments when you see Jango Fett vs. Obi Wan. You'll love fighting Joda as much as fighting Samuel L. Jackson. Good acting of Hayden Christensen, now showing his anger and probably future look of Darth Vader (hope this is not a spoiler). Despite the fact that this movie rules 100%, something is missing and it's very difficult to say what. 1) When you leave the movie, you get the feeling that it's incomplete, and it seems this way, as Joda say his final line, like it should be more of it. 2) All the cool things in the movie are not very long and you don't have enough time to enjoy the coolness of a certain moment. For example the Jango Fett fight or finale lighsaber duel - THEY ARE GOOD, but they seems to be short, far too short. They should have been more expanded. I love them and for me there is not enough time given to them. I could give more examples. 3) The whole movie you wait for something big, and when it seems to be coming- the movie ends. So that's of a minor complaints. But heck, bollocks to complaints. Go and see the movie! It's still rules.",1
1763,6.0,While I'm a huge fan of the Star Wars Franchise I wanted to write an unbiased review to help those that haven't seen this movie.,0
1764,6.0,I must start off by saying that I am a huge Star Wars fan and contrary to many reviews that i have read i did not like Episode 2 entirely.  It is above and beyond the shallow Episode One but that's not saying much. Episode 2 is almost equally as shallow filled with archetypes but no characters.  Plug in formula plot.  And so many special effects shots that you start to think that Lucas is making a cartoon with people in it.  Add to this that the editing is done with a meat clever and Lucas has almost no clue how to direct and you get this new era of Star Wars.  I'm not implying that the first three movies are works of perfection.  They have their flaws like all movies but they do offer something that these two new efforts don't; a sense that these characters actually exist in this world.  That they actually live and breathe day to day in this universe.  I don't fault the actors in not bringing life to the characters as much as i fault the writing.  The hammy dialogue doesn't sound like people talking but like people needing to say very little just to advance the plot which is necessary in order to show more effects.  ,0
1765,7.0,"The Attack is much better than the Phantom Menace - with well-developed story, more detailed characters, better acting, much more action and sense. But it is still quite enough dull and shallow. In 70-ies it could be fantastic movie, but now, when we have The Matrix, Spiderman etc. it is not so easy to impress. And all these ""copy-and-paste-from-another movie"" moments... ""Gladiator"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Lara Croft"", ""Blade Runner"". We have even some ""Titanic"" moments. Scale: 7 out of 10 at most, maybe 6 and a half. Waiting for The Matrix 2 and 3...",0
1766,6.0,I was leery.,0
1767,7.0,"I thought it was surprisingly good and much better than SW:E1. I really didn't expect much from the kid who played Anakin.  He looked like a ""pretty-boy"" and I doubted I would like him much.  But, surprise!  I did. I empathize with him, anyway.  I think the actor was well chosen.  He was a perfect blend of boy and man.  He did best when he was portraying the difficult emotions (love/hate/ambition) that will eventually turn him to the dark side.  It bodes well for the third movie. His character was weakest when dealing with the other Jedi.  I think being called me ""my young padua"" so many times would turn anyone to the dark side. No wonder he thinks Obi Wan is talking down to him. I was pretty impressed with the dynamics between Anakin and Padme.  It seemed pretty authentic.  I really believed Anakin's professions of love -- even that funny one about sand -- that one reminded me that he really is still partly a kid. The special effects were very sumptuous, and pretty darn cool, especially when used to describe the variety of life in that universe.  The different life forms, the different architecture, and the different ship types were all fascinating to observe. So, that's what I liked about it.  There were a few not so great points, however. I thought the battle scenes lacked coherency.  It was like they strung together a bunch of explosions and flying lightsabers.  When you can't follow individual fights within a battle, you can't identify with the combatants.  It just goes to show bigger isn't always better.  It made me miss the good ol' space battles from the original series.  There you saw the face of the pilot as he ran from a tie-fighter, then was saved by a friend (or he was vaporized). I think the Jedi Council is acting really inconsistently.  They know Anakin has a thing for Padme, but they keep on assigning him to spend time with her?  Yoda ""saw"" that Anakin was having a traumatic experience, but there was no kind of councilling?  I think the old saw about ""the dark side is clouding their sight"" (or whatever Count Dooku said) is a pretty feeble explanation.  So much for the great and powerful Jedi. Lastly, I hope they explain the ""Anakin will bring balance to the Force"" or whatever the Prophecy is supposed to be. Anyway, overall I liked it a lot.  I look forward to seeing Episode 3, especially since I know that they picked a good Anakin. Oh, as an aside, did you notice the variety of ethnic types they had represented in the actors?  Besides good ol' white, there was a South-east Asian (Indian?) woman playing the new queen of Naboo, an East Asian woman playing the shapechanger bounty hunter, several black characters (in the Jedi Council and Padme's body guards), a Hispanic actor in the Senate who will (in the next movie) be Leia's guardian, and a New Zealand actor of mixed heritage playing Jenga Fett.  Very cool!  :)",1
1768,10.0,For all of the people who dislike this episode for any reason read my comment. You may have your highlight moment(s) but see the key scenes I think are important in the film but first The original trilogy is some of the greatest films and the Phantom Menace I like very much. I had absolutely no problem with it at all. It is an impressive movie but Attack of the Clones is most impressive!,1
1769,,"Here's my two cents concerning Attack of the Clones, George Lucas, and Star Wars.  I think what we have here is a movie that is technically superb, but with a weak script.  George Lucas is one of the greatest visionaries Hollywood has ever seen.  Without him, movies would still be in the stone ages.  However, that does not mean he could tell a good story.  If he only stuck to what he's good at, and left the script to someone else, he would still be a god right now.  What a shame.",0
1770,,"The biggest gripe I had with this movie was Hayden Christensen's performance, coupled with the way his character was written.  Instead of Anakin being portrayed as a 20 year-old 'seemingly' mature young man struggling inside with his own 'dark' issues, he comes across as a 15 year-old brat whose voice hasn't changed yet.  His 10 year old Phantom Menace counterpart was more mature!  Since when is having temper tantrums considered to be an attractive quality?  When he yelled, 'It's all Obi-Wan's fault!'  I was like, 'What!  OK, I've had enough of him.  He needs a kick in the pants!', but they just had Padme fall for him even harder, which is totally beyond me.  I know Hayden is 21 years old in real life, but he is a very young looking 21.  He looks like he just got out of the 9th grade. They needed someone who looked older and could be more believable as a romantic lead and they should have written less hissy fits into the storyline (or how about no hissy fits at all?)....",0

Though it was not really a bad movie as it was labelled by critics and Star Wars fans, I did not believe it was worthy of the Star Wars name and I feel George Lucas knew that too. However, with the arrival of Episode II, Lucas has made up for Episode I tenfold.  Attack of the Clones has everything that the movie fans loved in the original trilogy, and perhaps the two greatest moments of all the films: those being the Jedi battle in the Genocian arena and Yoda's duel with Count Dooku.",1

There were some problems but it doesn't take away from the movie.  I just watched Return of the Jedi the other day and I liked it so much more.  It makes more sense now, because we have seen Anakin as a good guy.  And his performance was pretty good, some spots were bad, but mostly he did a good job.  But just wait until they are all done, then it will be good to those who didn't like it now. Do read the book though it is alot better.  The scene where Anakin dips into the dark side is way better.",1
1778,8.0,"I think this movie (and the other prequels) got a bad rap because they were different from the original trilogy, and they are different. However, this movie is by far the best of the 3 prequels. It tells a great story that's very important to the overall Star Wars storyline. So many awesome characters are in the movie and it helps explain many things we saw in the original trilogy. It's far superior over any of the 3 movies of the last trilogy. I must admit I wasn't necessarily a fan of it the first time I saw it as I'm a child of the original trilogy times but once I got over it being different and accepted it for what it is I love this movie! Give it a chance, watch it again and I'm sure you will find it is a really good movie.",1

1780,10.0,"Surprisingly enough, I really liked this film. The only reason I had actually gone to see it was because of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Cristensen- I'd never watched a Star Wars movie before (Yes- I am a freak). Although most people have critised Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's acting, I have to disagree. Regardless of whether or not Anakin's character lived up to all the fans' expectations of what Darth Vader should have been like when he was younger, Christensen did a superb job with his role. Hayden has a very unique way of acting that makes him stand out from all the other young actors and he really put a lot of emotion and realism in it and I could truly see him as a person, not just as a fictional character. The scene with his mother and the one where he is confessing to Padme are incredibly moving. Natalie, though she seemed a bit bored and stiff at times, was very good with her eyes. In the confession scene you can see all the terror and hurt she is going through when listening to Anakin talk about killing the Tuskens, while also seeing the compassion she is feeling for him and the instinct she has to comfort him.  Ewan McGregor is amazing as usual (too bad he didn't sing...:D) and brings a light touch of humor to all of his scenes. I heard he hates the Star Wars prequels and George Lucas, though...that's pretty freaking hilarious. Franz Oz is absolutely the best! I love Yoda!!!",1

We are no longer impressed with Special Effects. It bores us. We need story lines. We need acting. I've seen these actors act before. They are good. All of them. Even Mr. Jackson was weak. I thought that was impossible. But when Yoda puts out the best performance, something is seriously wrong. I don't want to be disappointed. I am also not a clone.

AOTC has its moments, and some decent performances from Ewan Macgregor, Christopher Lee, Ian MacDermid and the unforgettable computer animated YODA. There is a decent battle scene and the confrontation between Dooku and the Jedis is quite good.",0

The final battle with Count Dooku is not super good but still okay. Anakin is very annoying in the film and his lines are quite bad. There is still good music in the film. The best thing about the film is the fight between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan kenobi and the gladiator arena fight.

Even the acting is not that great to be honest, and it is sad to see that this movie get's good scores only because it is called STAR WARS! If it was called something like Space Wars and was not from Lucas, most of you would say it is not worth Star Wars and give it a 3/10 rating or something, every one is free to be fan of something i agree but really try to open your eyes and be a bit realistic.",0

Hayden is a good actor, but Anakin, if he were real, would probably be a bit wooden.  He grew up a slave, was whisked away from his mother and placed into strict discipline and training.  Were he real, he would probably be confused as who he really was and his behavior around others would be awkward.  Hayden plays that well.        ",1

Thanks to funny people in the central theater in Amsterdam, who helped with their jokes to ""survive"" embarassing love-story scenes of the movie: Lukas has proved once more he has no clue how to film anything else but special effects scene...and those were really good! The scenes of the paradise lake country (was it filmed on Italian Lakes???) are amazing, special effects of the city chase and last battle are inventive and spectacular. Despite lots of praises in media I did not notice any improvement in the script though. Moreover, I find that the second episode misses some irony that the first episode had. But in general I can recommend this movie as a good no-brain entertainment for a summer week-end. How would I rate it?? Well 7 out of 10, I would say.",1
1814,,"I'm sorry, but this film featured some of the worst screen performances I have seen since ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".  The acting by the two leads, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, is laughable, and many in the audience I saw it with did just that.  It was that pathetic.  Even Ewan McGregor, who normally is a fine actor, fell on his face with his leaden lines.  You could hear his attempts at humor falling like so much dead weight in the silence of the audience.  While the story in general is interesting and it's fun to see how all the pieces fall into place, the absolutely amateurish quality of the writing can't be covered up by any amount of special effects (which, though excellent, are as usual way overdone).  If you must go see this, go with low or no expectations, and you won't be disappointed.  If, however, you really don't want to waste your money on making George even wealthier with no payoff for you, then go rent ""Dark Star"" by John Carpenter to see how to make an excellent, hilarious movie with no budget at all.",0

The Phantom Menace was the biggest cinematic let down in history, I'm not denying that, but this... this film went further, deeper and it is for my money the most vapid, soulless and boring film of the entire Star Wars saga. I could go into detail here about the monotonous use of digital effects, terrible script, lack of plot, bad direction etc... but I believe Red Letter Media have done a very thorough job of that with their 70 minute reviews on YouTube and their own website. I would like to say that there is one scene in particular which has offended me since the first moment I saw it, and for my money summarises the shambles that are the Star Wars prequels; Yoda fights with a light sabre. As a child growing up in the 80s, Star Wars was the coolest thing to ever happen. I got the toys for Christmas, I worshipped the films and I feel so so so lucky to have had them as part of my youth. As an adult The Empire Strikes back remains one of the greatest films in my mind and have a great affection for it. It introduced us to Yoda and deeper into the ways of the force. When Luke gives up, says to Yoda ""you ask the impossible"", Yoda levitates the X wing the music swells and Luke at once realises the power of the force and that it transcends the physical limits of the world... ""Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter"". Beautiful, awe inspiring cinema. At the other end of the spectrum we have Yoda fighting with a tiny lightsabre in Attack of the Clones. George Lucas ruined it, right... there. And that's where this review ends.",0

There is a lot of character and story development in the first hour, and at times I found myself checking my watch. Just as I was about to write this off as another mediocre ""Phantom Menace"", it kicks into high gear for what I think is the most amazing hour of any Star Wars movie.

The attack of the clones happens about 2 hours into the movie which was a side bar to the movie if anything.  The digital visuals though ""very clear"" PALE in comparison to the visuals of the 1st three movies.  The Fifth Element already did the car chase scene 8 years ago! A clear failure of vision and CG technology.  This movie is a testament that acting, alien costumes and miniature model's cannot be replaced with CG graphics.  And moreover, visuals cannot carry a movie without acting or direction.  Wake up George.  You have too much money and the fact that you don't answer to anyone leaves us to suffer with your monolithic vision of how film should be made.  I can't help but remember Mark Hamill's comment about you in his biography, "" I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a way to make movies without actors, George (Lucas) would do it.""

George lucas has no ear for dialogue and the scenes where people are talking are pretty rough because of it. Acting is bad in this movie for several reasons, ewan mcgregor is straight jacketed into an alec guiness impersonation. Everyone seems to have trouble working with the huge amounts of computer effects. It seems like no on really has any idea what is going on in the shot. Hayden Christensen would have been good, there is a scene where he starts to get angry, but unfortunately George Lucas lacks Cajones and doesn't show anakin skywalker go insane and kill a bunch of tuskan raiders.

You still see Jar Jar Binks but his screen time is significantly cut down, THANK GOD!!!  But also you have to sit through about 2 hours of slow stuff just to see Yoda kick some butt, which is definitely the best part of the film.  Save time and rent the film so you can just fast forward it to that scene, the rest is like the Jake LLoyd acting school took over.",1

1844,5.0,"Star Wars:Episode II Attack of the Clones is the second installment in the Prequel Trilogy and by many(included me) considered the worst in the franchise.This film suffers from a lot of problems like bad dialogue(i.e.I don't like sand),the lack of character development in almost all of the main characters and a cliché,boring love story with no chemistry between the main characters.The film also suffers from the overuse of CGI that looks dated and has some shots that were considered bad at the time( I don't say that the visuals are bad in this movie but that they overuse CGI that is not as good as the originals practical effects).Attack of the Clones also had some bad acting from Hayden Christensen(I don't think that he is a bad actor but the lines he had to say were bad).The movie wasn't completely awful and had some thing to enjoy like the extremely fun performance by Ewan McGregor and the great performance by Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. The music score by John Williams is very good and the action sequences(lightsaber duels) are well choreographed and are very fast paced and incredibly fun.I also enjoyed Obi Wan's character who wasn't developed but had a fun personality and was lovable because of McGregor's performance.The only character in the film who was kind of developed was Anakin who had suffered from some tragic events through the movie that changed him(that doesn't make him three dimensional and complex but it is still something).In a nutshell the movie is mediocre to bad ,sometimes boring and doesn't invest you into the story but has some things to enjoy.",0

I think i'd definately oversaturated myself with internet gossip and trailers and finally my excitement at the movies release had faded to a bit of a blip during the last couple of weeks. So how is the movie? It seems to me that opinion will really be divided on this one - I for one, enjoyed The Phantom Menace more than this episode. The pacing choreography and tone were all better in TPM, especially the lightsaber duels and the brooding presence of Darth Maul. Here we have much looser choreography, Haydn is not much good with a lightsaber, Dooku seems far too old and cuddly - like Chris Lee in fact, to be truly threatening. Like TPM, AOTC may improve with viewings and will probably look better on DVD than at the cinema (as did TPM in my opinion). By the way remember Ewan's disturbing habit of putting on weight and changing his hairstyle in different scenes during the first film - now he changes beard density and age (you'll see what I mean or rather I hope you don't notice for your sake). Ultimately, I came out of AOTC feeling like i'd finally outgrown Star Wars and if the kids loved it then thats ok with me. Who knows it might grow on me more with time..... 3/5",1

When the action comes on the scene all memory of the slow romance is forgotten.  Most of the acting is average (except Ewan McGregor who deserves some sort of accolade) and the story moved along smoothly. Yoda is the hero of the movie. I will forever remember that dual.

We're shown a few rooms, views through these rooms, views during chases that also feel bland, and not much else. The changes between scenery are appreciated, but not very well done, since we see very little of those different planets. They're just a backdrop. There is only one really intriguing part to the movie, and that is Obi Wan's journey into space to find a hidden space station. That's about it.

I do appreciate that the movie is showing the steps needed for Palpatine to become emperor, but the script is so boring at conveying this information.

The only part that drew a groan from the audience was the appearance of Jar Jar Binks; but that was more than made up for by the amazing action sequences, each one better than the last - the speeder chase on Coruscant, Jango Fett vs.Obi Wan Kenobi(in the rain!),and finally the battle between Jedis, Clone troopers, droids and monsters in a gladiator arena.",1

Everything is better, the characters, the action, the emotions, the plot development. The only problem I had with the movie was the dialog. It all seems so predictable and cliche, and mostly referencing to other movies. Sure, it's funny when Obi-Wan says ""Anakin, you'll be the death of me someday"", but it reminded me more of the Jay and Silent Bob movie with all those clever little quips.

I know, I know, Star Wars is just about having a good time and seeing some nice special effects. Epsiodes 1 & 2 have all the effects, but none of the fun! Ewan MacGregor seems to be the only person on the set who said, ""Wait a minute, I'm in a movie called Attack of the Clones,"" and decided not to take the damn thing so seriously. Just relax, people. It's OK if these movies are bad, it's not the end of the world. George Lucas couldn't direct a Sierra Mist commercial.

He has proven himself an actor.  Yeah, Anakin was bit of a jackass but that's how he was supposed to be.  He was supposed to be a narcissist, that's how he became Darth Vader.

Yes it has all the glitzy animated creatures/ machines blah blah. But this series was supposed to concentrate on bringing up the characters of Anakin, Padme and to throw light on the reign of the dark side. I totally disagree with the choice of Hayden as Anakin(yes he's supposed to be one of the better looking people as per some magazine) but that still does not upgrade his acting skill which I found wooden and a bit trite. His accent also threw me off as it stilted his line delivery. But then again I did notice a rather racial bias against people of other countries(all the bad characters had accents that  we obviously can associate with certain non-american people). All good-white, all bad-asian, south american. However I seem to be rambling on... anyway the initial action scene was a hackneyed scene and didn't impress me at all (too much attention was paid to this scene) and then the action thing just died down, It seemed that Lucas ran out of ideas after this and just put together one hackneyed scene after another.

However, i won't lie, there are 5 good scenes in this movie, the beginning with the hover car chase, that led to the funny bar scene. anakin meeting his mom is genuinely heartwarming. and the funny and scary scene in the droid factory. and also there's a cool scene where anakin, padame, and obi-wan are made to fight 3 monsters, and it leads to a cool climatic battle.",0

An under-developed love story, editing that is like a see-saw sapping any tension before it can start.  And it looks terrible.  The digital process may be great for the backgrounds and the all-CGI characters, but the human figures look flat and washed-out.  Compared to the lively original films [the first two, anyway], this is like a Star Wars film sapped of everything good.  The series is dead but the good news is there is only one left.  Lucas keeps saying that this is all set-up to number three.  So far we have been given over fours hours of set-up--Phantom Menace and now this--how about just giving us a good movie?  The first Star Wars was ""set-up"" in a couple of minutes.  Now it takes two mediocre films to set us up for a third?  I'm sorry, this is the worst of all time.",0

This may be the single worst major `Hollywood big time production' for dialogue ever released.

With all of the money and talent around this project the best that you can come up with is Hayden Christensen as the young Anakin Skywalker?  Are you on crack?  This kid is as wooden as any wooden Indian in any antique store around the world.  What were you thinking?  How could the scenes with Nataline Portman AKA Senator Amidala be any worse?

1885,6.0,"George Lucas returns to his roots and produces the second best Star Wars movie overall (after The Empire Strikes Back).  The action, adventure, sense of wonder and sense of humor which were noticeably absent from The Phantom Menace (except in parts) are all back with a vengeance.  Thankfully, Jar Jar Binks screen time is limited, though oddly enough his time on screen still managed to be so awkward and hackneyed that it made me wince.  By far, however, the biggest reason why AOTC cannot score higher than an 8 out 10 in this reviewer's mind is due to the idiotic dialogue between Amadala and Anakin during their love scenes.  The scripting in these parts is absolutely horrible to the point that my date and I were literally laughing out loud during the scenes.  In some movies if a scene doesn't go over right it can make you squirm or even feel a little embarrassed.  The dialogue and, consequently, the acting in these love scenes was so bad that all we could do was shake our heads and laugh.  From what we could tell, everyone else in the packed theater felt exactly the same way with several people giggling, shaking their heads, or simply resting their heads in their hands trying to hide their eyes.  Lucas is a genius at times when it comes to dreaming up these far away locales and the action scenes in this film are incredible and very impressive.  But he needs to face facts: the guy does not have even a simple grasp of what a love scene should sound like or how two people in love should talk to each other.  Granted, we're talking about a distant galaxy where customs and speech patterns could realistically be quite different than ours, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is that it is just CHEESEY.  Regardless of anything else, you have to be able to appeal to the audience of today...and people today, for the most part, aren't going to take that kind of crap seriously.  When Anakin says to Amadala, ""I don't like sand...it's course...and it gets everywhere.  It's not like you...you're everything that is soft - and smooth"" it was all I could do to keep myself from literally rolling out of my seat.  My girlfriend and I, along with the rest of the theater sat there slack-jawed that the dialogue was that cheesey.  Believe me, there is a reason I have gone off on this one point for so long: it dropped an otherwise ""almost perfect"" movie down a couple of big notches.  If Lucas had any humility and could recognize his weaknesses as a screen-writer he would have brought in some help to re-write those scenes and to try to form a real bond and romance between the two main characters.  It would have made an otherwise very good, very entertaining movie nearly perfect.",0

Reviewers were rather divided on the movie, some screaming ""A+"" and some screaming ""bloody hell"". Without a doubt this part is superior to ""Episode I"", with faster action, more spectacular special effects and more character development. And while I believe that critics nowadays are completely unreliable (consider the Sony Movie Studio's fake critic) and the major ones tend to vote in blocks (Olympic skating comes to mind), I do agree with one of the common arguments from the negative reviews: ""this movie will appeal much more to the true fan of ""Star Wars"" saga""... except that I find nothing NEGATIVE in that comment: Why in the world would anyone who is NOT a fan, ever go see Part II of a series?

Hayden Christiansen was a brilliant Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor was great as usual and Yoda... well, see the movie yourself and giggle like a giddy school girl at Yoda.  Now, I am one of the few defenders of the Phantom Menace.  I think it was lighter than the other films because Lucas was trying to portray a much more peaceful time in the galaxy.  Yes, Jake ""Mannequin Skywalker"" Lloyd was not the greatest actor and yes, Jar Jar Binks brought out the dark side in us all.  But one thing I think happened was just what I said would happen. Phantom makes a lot more sense now!  Now we know that Jar Jar was there for a reason: (spoiler alert) To bring down the Republic!  The master plan of Darth Sidious is much more clear now, Anakin's path to the dark side has become more evident, and the birth of the Empire is imminent.  I think I can slip my Episode 1 dvd in now and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Lucas, the emperor himself, has everything mapped out and everything is going according to plan.  So I urge everyone to see Attack of the Clones and if you didn't like Phantom, go back and watch it again after seeing this great movie.

1903,6.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Being a huge star war fan, i knew the backround to each of the events. This movie has got to be one of the best!

1905,,"It is safe to say that Star Wars gets better and better every episode. Personally, I believe that this has to be one of the greatest episodes in the entire Star Wars saga with exception to Episode III which has not been released yet.  Episode II reveals a lot of what happens through the course of Anakin Skywalkers transition phase to the dark side of the force. The film takes place ten years after the events that occurred in Episode I, in which Anakin has grown older and has become Obi Wan Kenobis jedi apprentice.  Most of the characters from Episode One return in this movie, however Jar Jar Bink has a rather short but important role in Episode II.  This film reveals the life of Anakin Skywalker while he is in the process of becoming corrupt by power and anger as well as it being more of a love story. Samuel L Jackson and Ewan McGregor are awesome in this movie, but Yoda steals the entire film.  The droids also have a solid role in this film. Natalie Portman is so hot and she gets better and better in the series.",1
1906,1.0,"The biggest expectation for this movie was to be better than its predecessor The Phantom Menace.  It has fulfilled that expectation yet in all other aspects this movie lacks greatly.  Star Wars fans may have been dreading the love story.  Their dread is well-founded especially considering the love story is built upon poorly written dialogue, sub-par acting from good actors and special effects that are not so special.  The computer generated backgrounds are definitely not up to par with the old movies which is a shame.  The fighting sequences involve way too many people and a ridiculous amount of quick cuts and panning.  The film moves along sluggishly and spends a long time unsuccessfully trying to convince us we should care about the Anakin and Padme love story.  The last half hour is probably the only redeeming aspect of the film as plot and action finally start moving.  The best light sabre fight scene takes place within this half hour and is probably also the most surprising scene.  The end made me wish the movie was longer while the beginning made me wish the movie would end.  This is by no means a horrible movie, but by the same token it is not a good one.  George Lucas should use the help of Lawrence Kasdan and anyone else who may want to lend a hand for the next one if he expects it to be up to par with the original trilogy.",0

1908,5.0,"First, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Star Wars, Episode II - the visual effects were spectacular, and though I had seen the first installment, I would have appreciated it just as much with no prior Star Wars knowledge. It says something about George Lucas that he can make it supply the vital links between parts past and future, as well as making the film a decent stand-alone piece. The film also made me laugh. Star Wars purists would be appalled by this - surely the genre is meant to be full of meaning, metaphor and sincerity. I'm more flexible myself, however there are only so many times that yet another character or force joins a single battle (which we had been led to believe was won, yet again) before it descends into something slightly ridiculous. The cinema erupted in hysterics in master yoda's fight scene - surely not the intention of the director? I think maybe Lucas was trying too hard to 'fill in the gaps' and provide viewers with an easy guide to who's going to be who in future - Obi Wan's comment to his troublesome pupil 'you're going to be the death of me' after a high-octane chase scene bordered on the poststructuralist surreal.  Having said that, though, I appreciate Lucas had a difficult job to do, which he performed to aplomb - making the movie exciting when anyone who has seen 'Star Wars' (don't read on if you haven't) knows damn well that Obi Wan, Yoda and Anakin will survive in order to feature in the original films. Despite knowing that she must survive in order to conceive Luke, I was still enthralled watching Senator Amidala's struggle to survive. In all, then, a film definitely worth watching - just suspend your sense of disbelief, and avoid being pedantic, and Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is one of those films you can just sit back and enjoy, regardless of the occasional ludicrousies. Mind you, it would have been far better with some good acting - I am an actor and director myself and can imagine how hard it is to act against a character whose presence is only digitally added later, but even taking that into account, the standard of acting was, on the whole, sub-soap opera level, which even the cinema audience picked up on (more hysterical laughter) when Amidala suddenly and unconvincingly declared 'aaah...ahhh, er, I'm fine' on the desert sands towards the end. Nevertheless, a forcefully fun film to watch.",1
1909,2.0,"Phew! This is, by far the worst movie i've ever seen! I hope someone else directs the next one. I am a huge fan of the old trilogy, but this awful display of over-CGI, bad acting (especially that snotty Anakin) and more, has made me lose faith in George Lucas. Crap, crap, crap...",0
1910,3.0,"Now thats not to say I am blind to its faults but despite that, I still enjoyed it. When I first went to see it I saw it back to back with Spider Man. I sat there and criticized every single thing that looked wrong to me. I thought wow people were right, this film has a lot of flaws. I rented it when it first came out on DVD and didn't care for it much at all. Then a year later I rented it on DVD again I had gotten back in to the Star Wars Craze and became more of a Fan of the Franchise so to speak. I saw it and fell in Love with it. Why? because I really took a long thorough look at this film and put aside my harsh critique of it. I Loved the Battle at geonosis I was thinking alright! Laser War! what a feast for the eyes that was! I loved all the action scenes they were great. I loved all the characters Yoda doesn't look that bad, in fact he looks a hex of a lot more expressive and you tell me how he would have been able to do that Lightsabre Duel against Dooku if he was still the puppet; strings would be showing for sure. I Liked Hayden Christensen He has a james dean edge and what he lacks in expression he makes up for with his eyes they are are very expressive. Natalie Portman did a good job again as Padme, though I liked her in Episode 1 a lot better. Ewan Mgregor turned in another wonderful performance as Obi-wan. All the actors were great in this film.

1911,9.0,"Fine and Much better follow up to The Phantom Menace plants the seeds of what is to come but lacks the conviction to take it forward to where it should be.

Natalie Portman is terrible she could not act herself out of a paper bag.  Her character was totally unbelievable, a senator who looked 13, giggled while making puppy love to a leading man who was supposed to be many years her junior and looked many years older than her.  I am totally disappointed in the movie going public, their support of junk like this only means we are going to get more junk.",0

The scene that Master Yoda fights against Count Dooku is easily be the best sequence of the movie. The romance is okay, but it is not as interesting as the special effects. George Lucas is one of the best action directors of our time. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",1

The ending sequences were some of the best, and most entertaining of any movie I have seen. The storm trooper drop ships, and that entire battle, reminded me of Black Hawk Down. In fact I like how the storm troopers in ATOC seem much more like a cohesive military force.",1

1921,,"Yes its a great franchise and remains cutting edge on the technical side..... But what is the essential ingredient in a good movie based on a story? Personally I favor the interaction and development of the central characters. I think a more simple explanation is at the root of the emptiness of the last two episodes.... Poor casting. What was a regal bearing in Alec Guiness manifests itself as sensitive, fussy and even camp in Ewan McGregor. He doesn't cut it. Temuera Morrison gets past the special effects to deliver a good performance as does Christopher Lee and for that matter Samuel L. But Christensen has no charisma and he is the central character in this instalment. He lacks complexity in what could have been an excellent role for an edgey  young upstart. Picture someone of the caliber of a starting out Sean Penn playing the role. Cool, likeable but with a distinct dark side,  being mentored by ..... problem to find an English star who is not foppish and or a whimp... and who is not rough like bleedin Vinnie Jones. If Rene the Texan can do a convincing English accent then..... get an Australian to do it. Back when Menace was being cast they could have afforded Russell, Guy and Hugh..",0
1922,6.0,"An improvement on The Phantom Menace. I was entertained for most of the way, but a lot of the flaws of ""Episode 1"" and in George Lucas' films generally are painfully apparent.

1923,10.0,"It never ceases to amaze me how many so called fans of the original Star Wars trilogy go out of their way to trash these new installments. It only goes to show how ignorant and unhappy some people are.

1925,5.0,"I found this to be a fairly bland and disappointing movie.  Nice set design, some very clever and creative effects and settings.  But, once you get past that, there are several problems.  First, there isn't any chemistry between the Portman character and Skywalker, who I found rather creepy, not sympathetic, and the dialogue between them is trite and their scenes together quickly became tiresome.  Also, I found the transitions between some scenes to be rather jarring, as though some intervening scenes might have been cut out in the editing process.  And the actions scenes feel rushed, just some staged set pieces with no build up, so no tension in them. I can't help but compare the very busy and noisy but uninvolving action scenes here with someone who knows how to stage a scene, like Michael Mann in Mohicans and Heat. Rating, 5/10",0
1926,9.0,"I really liked this movie. Hayden Christensen,Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman,Samuel L.Jackson,Christopher Lee and the rest of the cast were exceptional in this movie.Hayden Christensen was very good in his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker.

I really do recommend that anyone that has not seen this movie to do so I am sure you would not be disappointed.The story really was well put together.The bottom line is that it was a really good movie,in my opinion at least. I am biased though because I really like the series.I have all the movies and I never get tired of watching them.",1
1927,9.0,I was absolutely elated after seeing this movie. It was far better than anything I expected. It matches up well with the first two films in the trilogy. I loved every moment of every scene and found no problems. Natalie Portman was the most beautiful thing in it. Hayden and Ewan both gave competent performances. The special effects and battle scenes were truly awesome. It was easily the best film I have seen this year.,1
1928,4.0,"George has taken out the electric sander and used a roll of 80 grit on the ""edges"" of Episode 1 to make Episode 2.",1
1929,4.0,"I wish I could say that Attack of the Clones satisfied the void I've felt after being disappointed three years ago with The Phantom Menace.  But I can't.  I left the theater contemplating if I even enjoyed it more than Episode I.  As mediocre as Episode I was, I still left that movie feeling exhilarated after witnessing the best lightsaber battle ever.  I was a bit distraught that Darth Maul had died, but in the short time he was there he kicked major ass.  I had heard that the last 30 minutes of Episode II were intense and non-stop action.  I kept waiting for it.  Oh, there was action, but it barely raised my pulse.  And why?  Everybody else seemed to be enjoying themselves.  When the movie ended everybody cheered.  So why, why didn't I get that same enjoyment from the movie?  I know why.  It was a problem with Episode I and is even more apparent in this one.  It's what the Star Wars franchise has become, and unfortunately there's no way around it. What am I referring to?  Well, there was one word that kept popping into my mind the entire time while watching this movie: Artificial.  This wasn't a movie I was watching, this was all one big special effect.  Every scene and I mean EVERY scene just oozed computer trickery.  No matter how simple a scene might've been, it was ""touched up"" by the folks at Industrial Light & Magic.  But hey, this is ILM, the very best in the business right?  It shouldn't be a problem.  Oh, but it is.  I don't understand why, if George Lucas owns ILM, and this is freakin' Star Wars (the reason ILM was created), why then do the special effect look so sub-par.  Maybe one or two scenes were impressive, but it's hard to get ""into"" a movie when you can't believe what you're seeing on screen.  Sure, the Star Wars franchise has always depended on special effects - there's no way around that.  But in the original trilogy they were used to enhance the movie, they were not the movie itself.  And that's what Star Wars has become.  There's no heart anymore.  There's nothing ""real"".  It has become so artificial it's difficult to bond with the film.  The entire time while watching this movie I was wondering if anything was filmed on location.  Hell, I even would have taken sets.  Sound stages.  Anything that the actors could reach out and actually touch and interact with.  But no.  I'd say that 95% of this movie was filmed in front of a blue screen.  And it shows.  You can't blame the actor's for stale performances - it's hard to act when there's nothing there.  Can it be just me?  Am I the only one who can see just how fake everything looks?  In many scenes it was as if real actors were just inserted into a CG movie (which is essentially what it is).",0
1930,10.0,This movie is so good on so many levels!,0
1931,9.0,"The latest Star Wars film is an excellent addition to the series that easily tops Phantom Menace and Return of the Jedi.  With amazing special effects, exciting action scenes, and a servicalbe story-line this is easily up there as one of if not the best popcorn movie of the year.  I really liked how everything in the film was beginning to look and feal like the Star Wars we know and love from the original trilogy.  The story is very complicated with several things happening at once; a detective-like story with Obi-Wan, a love story with Anakin and Amidala, political intrigue in the senate, what Count Dooku is up to, and of course why this film is called Attack of the Clones.  The action scenes are plentiful, and far more exciting then Spider-Man all the other Star Wars films as well.  We have a speeder chase through the streets of Couracent, a great fight scene between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, a space battle near asteroids, a chase though a conveyor belt, the Gladiaor-like execturiton arena, the all-out Jedi fight, thousands of clones and droids going at it, and last but not least a incredible fight at the end with Count Dooku and Yoda. There are some complaints I have about the film.  The acting was subpar on several occasions, especially Hayden Christenson.  The dialouge was laughably bad in more then one spot and the love story was poorly executed. I also felt that some of the action scenes were far too short; like the fight between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan, A climax fight with Jango Fett and Mace Windu, and most disappointing of all the light saber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku. Despite some probelms, Attack of the Clones was as good as anyone could expect it to be if not better.  George Lucas has done a film to be proud of.",1
1932,8.0,"First, I am a fan of the Star Wars series. 'A New Hope' being the second movie I ever saw (when I was 6), I really did not have much of a choice. However, I am not a fan of biblical proportions. For example, although I know the Millennium Falcon will do .5 past light speed, I have never made myself up like Darth Maul. Nor do I have any delusions about the time-line inconsistencies of 'Empire' or the emotional emptiness and overuse of matte backdrops in 'Jedi'. I was also strikingly disappointed in 'Menace,' partly because it has several glaring inconsistencies with the events to come, but mostly because, despite its dazzling visuals, it was flat, with dialogue aimed at a 2nd grader, (i.e., - ""Coriscant, the entire planet is one big city,"" told to us as we are looking at the one big city. Lucas did not trust us enough to see the train when it was 2 feet in front of our noses and felt he had to clue us in on the obvious - insulting).",0

New viewers will struggle to follow plot threads that have meaning only in light of future events.",0
1935,,"To be honest, i never really gave this movie a chance. Being the strong leader-type person I am (haw.), I quickly submitted to the anti-Star Wars movement threatening to split the once-rock solid fan base and result in an cataclysmic 'Battle of the Nerds'. Then the movie was released and the balance of power shifted. One-time beievers in Star wars threw down their disproportioned Yoda costumes, home-made Jedi outfits, and burned their action figures, and joined the revolution. The Dark Side. When once only a small percentage had backlashed, the tables had been turned, it seemed, in the favor of the revelutionaries.",1
1936,9.0,"All elements of this film build on the foundation of the first film.  I felt also when watching this that the new trilogy is gathering pace towards it's climax.  The cast is improved from the first film with Christopher Lee giving a glorious performance as the machiavellian Count Dooku.  It's great to have a classic English actor playing a central role in a Star Wars film again.  I have to say that in the lead up to the film I wasn't convinced but well done to Hayden Christensen for pulling it off.  He has given the role of Anakin Skywalker the requisite brilliance, impetuousness and petulance that will ultimately lead him to the Dark Side of the Force.  Padme is again played almost as a ""mini-Leia"" by the gifted Natalie Portman (we await her performance in the last instalment of the trilogy).  The relationship between Anakin and Padme is dealt with tenderly and with clarity over their difficulties.  For very different reasons they struggle to deal with their feelings for one another.  By the end of the film the light sabre battle has to be seen to be believed and if that is all your interested in then you will not feel short changed.  All in all a magnificent follow up to the low-key Phantom Menace and I await the time when I can watch all six films back to back at my local cinema!",1
1937,10.0,"Excellent filmmaking. The only thing that makes Empire better than Clones, is the acting; otherwise Clones is superior. George brought back R2 and Threepio as the primary source of comic relief. All the Jango and Boba stuff was terrific. Anakin's temptations  are terrific. Amidala looks fantastic. ALL of the action scenes are incredible ; chase through Coruscant, Jango vs. Obi-Wan, etc. Mace was great. It's packed full of surprises, and connections with episodes 4, 5 and 6.

1950,7.0,"As a kid, I was a huge ""Star Wars"" fan and was thoroughly looking for to seeing ""Attack of the Clones.""  That said, after seeing the movie, I can honestly say I was somewhat disappointed.  While the movie was an improvement over ""Phantom of Menace,"" as a film overall, it was not very enjoyable.  This latest chapter seemed to focus more on a set up for the original trilogy, rather than telling a story.  The romance between Amidala and Anikan seemed force, and Obi-Wan was made to look like a nagging shrew, harping on Anikan's every fault.  No doubt the movie will make tons of money and the truly devout ""Star Wars"" fans will see it over and over.  But for the general movie going public, here's my review- it okay, but somewhat disappointing.",0
1951,7.0,***Some SPOILERS may be present****,0
1952,9.0,This is a very un-equilibrated movie. Scenes of UNSPEAKABLE beauty and imagination are followed by scenes of acting that is average at best. I gave the movie a 9 without a regret because of its imagination and also because of its action scenes.,1
1953,,This was a wonderful treat to behold.  What a great follow up to a not so great PHANTOM MENACE.  Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are astonishing as the two lovers.  I can not speak enough about how great this movie was.  The action was great and the story very complex and intriguing.,1
1954,8.0,"OK - so the title sounds campy, the dialogue is cheesy, and the production is designed to look larger than life. Now, are you ready for the really brilliant part? THAT'S THE POINT!!! (Note, some spoilers ahead, nothing too critical) If the first 20 minutes were any indication, then this might have been the greatest movie I've ever seen - if the first 20 minutes, highlighted by a speeder chase reminiscent of the ""Star Tours"" rides at the Disney Theme Parks, were any indication. Once the initial adrenaline rush fades, the next hour of the movie flips back and forth between a halfway intriguing detective story with Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a molasses-paced ""love"" story involving Anakin Skywalker and Padme. The whole point is to try and unravel who's out to kill Padme and destroy the Republic. The dialogue constructing most of these scenes was subpar, but not so nauseating that it killed the film. Maybe I'm not as prone to loathe a lot of said dialogue, since most of what Anakin threw out there sounds like what I would say: something awkward, naive, and juvenile. For the action scenes, the writing was no better or worse than ""The Matrix"" or ""Spider-Man"", especially when you consider each action scene in ""Spider-Man"" involved the stereotypical witness to the destruction pointing into the sky and screaming, ""LOOK, IT'S SPIDER-MAN!!"" Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film - the sum effect was easily able to outduel some of the slow parts, which would be just about any scene involving Natalie Portman. She looks good and all (though I do wonder if cable comes standard with those hairdos, of if she has to pay extra), but she just seems stiff and detached from everybody else. Example: near the end, when she finally decides to throw up her hands and say, `Sure Anakin, let's fall in love' (right before they're scheduled to be made into chop liver), she says `I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.' At least Anakin has the good sense to respond with a look of total confusion, letting us know we're not alone.  Maybe that's her fault; maybe it's Lucas' writing. Anyway, you can spend the film dissecting its `deep' dialogue and characters, or you can take in the scope and greatness of the design and effects, not to mention how incredibly badass Samuel L. Jackson is, and that Ewan McGregor holds his own as Obi Wan. The two droids (C-3PO and R2-D2) are once again in trouble which makes for good humor, and the design of the film is the work of some freakin' geniuses. Top it all off with the five coolest words of any Star Wars installment: Yoda in a fight scene. So some people like to ask `Why'. Me, I ask `Why not?'.  Movies are not about popularity (well, sometimes), not politics (well, sometimes), not money (well, all the time.) Sometimes, it's OK just to want a picture that gives you two hours of adventure and suspense in a darkened theater, an escape if you will. Such an attitude is a hallmark of the cheesy Flash Gordon serials of long ago, which planted the idea for a grand space opera in the mind of George Lucas. If what you really need from your sci-fi fantasy adventures is deep thought, character development, and `top of the line' acting, then I suggest you see a Star Trek movie. If I had to assign grades, I'd go  8/10, and I'll see it again.",0

1956,,"Man, this film blasted me off my feet!  And to think Episode I was eagerly awaited but this film was sold out all over the country for weeks!  So Ewan McGregor is back as Anakin Skywalker and with Obi-Wan Kenobi they set out to find out about some sort of cloning process going on on another planet. After Anakin's mother dies in his arms he is hell bent on gaining revenge and this is where it really kicks in!  The fight near the end is excellent, and especially the funny quotes Obi-Wan makes are unforgettable!  Anakin has his arm chopped off by a light saber and he marries the princess, and later they give birth to Luke Skywalker.  Although this film is called ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the clones only attack during the last 15 minutes of the film, so Episode III is really about the war (boy, I can't wait till that comes out!).  This film has some really advanced technology and buildings and computers (it must have cost a bomb to pay for it all!), and it is really interesting, your attention will never leave the screen once you get first glimpse.  10 out of 10.

I enjoyed this Movie alot. Corusont was a lot like a futuristic Los Angeles, complete with a 50's style diner and cocktail waitresses! the car chase was very impressive, one of the most breathtakingly beautiful sequences in the whole saga. excitement started to grow in me, watching Anikan and Padme's romance blossom, because we were witnessing the begaining of the Skywalker Family, and hearing the imperial march again was a real treat. and it's just been confirmed that James Earl Jones will return in episode three as Darth Vader! I'm looking forward to it. I think that they should bring the original trilogy back to theaters when that happens, as well as release it on DVD. starwars deserves to be appreciated by a whole new generation",1

1961,5.0,Honestly no one can describe whats wrong about this movie better than Mr. Plinkett. I could attempt to copy his points and mix in mine but honestly every fan of this and even none fans just anyone who watched the movie should also watch the review. One of the best things the internet has ever created.,0
1962,,"I've been keeping to myself about Episode I when I first saw it, because it truly disappointed me to know that this movie almost had no depth in it. I thought it was for the kids instead, entertaining them into the special effects and saber duels, which also goes for the Episode II release, and the only thing that excited me was Yoda's duel with Count Dooku. I admit, I was a kid when I saw Episode I and finally a teen at Episode II and was awed by it also, but I also reverred back to the original trilogy once I have gotten a hold of DVD release(thank god) and I just couldn't take it anymore. It pained me to know that Episodes I and II are terrible renditions of the much anticipated story of the transformation of Anakin into Darth Vader, and forced me to question whether George Lucas had really thought this story out correctly or was he just too terrible a director. I understand that the originals were ground-breaking masterpieces that demanded audiences' surrender to its powerful prowess in story and effects, and I understand now that with all this digital tech, the awe-capturing effects aren't possible. But that shouldn't excuse Lucas from creating a powerful story. Yes, in Episode II, it had a little more depth than Episode I, but the actors killed the effect. Hayden Christensen doesn't belong to the role of Anakin.....AT ALL. Natalie Portman so far, hasn't shown any true on-screen assurance of why she fell in love with Anakin in the first place. And yes, Jar Jar Binks had absolutely NO part in the story and is not significant at all, let alone his annoying accent. The special effects were overused and a bit choppy in comparison to other films. Hayden hasn't portrayed a single ounce of cynical and maniacal feeling into Anakin's character, but instead shows us all the pissy-pants nature in a lot of teenagers these days. Ewan had the potential to put more ""wise-man"" into Obi-wan's character, but he didn't. Natalie Portman's love for Anakin was dry and doesn't deserve a mention. Not even the story had a powerful effect on me like the original trilogy did. All in all, this new trilogy deserves better, which means, serious actors, and under-used special effects, which will put more of that ""oomph!!"" into the once-powerful grabbing attention effect onto people. ",1
1963,2.0,"Sins the movie commits: pretentiousness, being boring, blatant and detrimental overuse of computer graphics, using Jar-Jar at all, using Jar-Jar for the sole purpose of heading the intergalactic council and institute a state of emergency (what the... ????????), creating the most miserable love couple in all movie history, lack of credible and interesting villains, lack of coherent story. ",0
1964,1.0,"Believe it or not, but I had never seen a Star Wars movie before! For some reason it all passed me by the first time round, but the other day I saw this one in the video shop and I thought, why not, I probably should give it a go for a change.",1
1965,6.0,"The next few posts will all be Star Wars related as I am currently doing a Star Wars marathon, the prequels through to the originals. Also to save any confusion I have skipped 'The Phantom Menace' because I watched the first half an hour of it and to be frank, apart from Liam Neeson, it was unbearable. Especially the Gungans. Anyway, back to the review.",0
1966,6.0,"Episode 2 is undoubtedly better than the Phantom Menace, and continues the strengths of the first film whilst cutting down on the weaknesses. It is not however greater than any Star Wars Films other than its predecessor. Positives are once again the action sequences and special effects, but the real way Attack of the Clones improves on Episode One is by trimming away some of the unpopular areas of the first film. For example, there is far less of the first film's annoying and embarrassing comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, and slightly more action. Now for what I disliked about the film. First of all, George Lucas' dialogue has deteriorated even further than in the previous movie, and his story writing is uninspiring. There are some lines in Attack of the Clones which were too dreadful to fully comprehend on a first viewing. Performances in the film are, in most cases poor; Hayden Christensen, who portrays an older Anakin Skywalker, produces some of the most memorably awful acting that has ever graced the franchise, although shoddy dialogue could be argued as a root cause for the robotic performance Christensen gives. He and Natalie Portman's Padme Armidala engage in one of the most unconvincingly written romantic relationships in cinematic history, not helped by Portman's disappointing performance. Character development is once again missing, and you still can't get behind any of the main protagonists. At least on a positive note, we see Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu and Master Yoda get action scenes, and an antagonist superior to Darth Maul in Count Dooku, as portrayed by the late Christopher Lee. Overall, a marginally better installment than the previous film, which is dull, but more convincing than Episode One.",0
1967,6.0,"After keeping us waiting 3 more years Lucas pops out the next installment of his acclaimed saga, while fans were wondering ""Will this be better than The Phantom Menace?"". Well, the answer is yes and no. Unlike Menace, Attack of the Clones has more action than endless dialog, but as a result it fails to provide a decent plot.",0
1968,8.0,"I had seen The Phantom Menace, and not particularly liked it. I had heard the terrible title, Attack of the Clones. I had heard that it was bogged down by a love story. So it came as a pleasant surprise when I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1
1969,6.0,"i have to say that i just got back from star wars and i was very disappointed. I was excited, i thought it was going to be good. It was ok, but it was boring i thought. there was only a couple cool parts. when obi-wan and annikan go after that bounty hunter at the beginning was cool, when obi wan leaps through the window and catches that thing, that whole part was cool. every single sticky situation was lame. especially that stupid part where annikan and the amidala are stuck in that factory. even to see yoda fight seemed a joke to me. maybe it was supposed to be funny. those close ups of yoda during the duel were for some reason seemed to mock the whole series. and the part where you see yoda with all the kindergarden jedis was a total joke. I don't know why, i thought it was going to be good. the love story sucked. the guy who played annikan was good, and so was obi wan for the most part. i actually like jar jar binks, the underwater scene in the first one is my only lasting memory of that movie. i'm not into the politics, all i know is that all of a sudden there was an enormous war. i liked it better when there was only a few jedis, not an army of jedis. it was a joke, a moderately entertaining joke though. i was never too into star wars anyways. i'm all about tron. i guess there is no tron-starwars rivalry, but i feel like the underdog in one.",0
1970,2.0,"Padme met Anakin when he was eight (I think). A romance between the two is so creepy. That's bad enough, but the actor who plays him has no ability to emote and the two of them have no chemistry. Casting in general was totally wrong, even with all the heavy hitting names. Writing was just as awful. Other than wanting to know the storyline for the entire anthology, I'd never want to watch this movie for even just a few minutes. While watching this, I was embarrassed to own Disney stock the entire two plus hours. As with Phantom Menace, only Yoda it's makes the movie worth anything at all.",0
1971,10.0,"have to say, I was completely blown away...this totally blew Episode I out of the water within ten minutes, and, frankly, it rivals Return of the Jedi.

Pure delight.",1
1972,,I have two main problems with Episode II: the dialogue and the plot. ,0
1973,9.0,"After waiting outside the theatre (on a gracefully dry day, thankfully) for 8 hours, I must say, I was not disappointed in the least.  I don't know that I can say much without giving any spoilers, but I will say that fans of the classic trilogy will squeal with delight at many moments throughout the film.  C-3PO is back in all his wit, or is that witlessness?  One of my few critiques would be that at a particularly somber moment, 3PO chimed in with a bit of humor that was great but mis-timed.  Many lines oozed with doom knowing what is to come.  Since this was demonstrated in the trailer, I don't think it's a spoiler, but read cautiously - at first, when I heard how Anakin whines in the trailer, I was frustrated, ""That's just like Luke,"" I thought.  Then a smile came on my face and I said, ""That's just like Luke!"" We totally see how sweet and innocent looking Anakin could become the penultimate definition of evil through the course of this film.  There are so many other points I could talk about, but you'll just have to see it for yourself.  I am, again, tonight!",1
1974,10.0,"IT's all about the story, im always into how people tell the story. And this one gets to me. Though Phantom Menace didnt have a good one, this 2nd episode has created the 'missing link' tighter between the episodes of 5-7 and 1. So i dont blame George Lucas on episode 1 as it must as it is 'happened to be that way' thus bringing up more power in characterization and depth in the telling the EPIC story. What people didnt get it is, this is what it's supposed to be. But what i felt, Mr. Lucas did remarkably well was the scene of Yoda (all of it), as it brings higher level of wat people r gonna see Yoda (in his character) on Empire and Return of the Jedi and the conspiracy scenes. As classical and powerful as GODFATHER's revelations. Everybody did a great job, even the extras, tech and all (but im still waiting for John William to deliver a KILLER score as unforgettable as episode 1,4,5,6). This might be the best SW ever (but personally, im more into Empire Strikes back), and definately not dissapointing. Sheer movie power at its best.",1
1975,,"The force of Star Wars is back and back with a vengeance! Attack of the clones redeems the series and puts the brilliance and wonderment  back into the Star Wars name. After the mediocre Phantom Menace, I did have my doubts as to how good Episode 2 would be. After seeing the trailers and reading some relatively positive preview reviews, I decided to take a chance. I figured the very least, it would offer some amazing eye candy and awesome sound, even if the plot or character development was straw thin. And its a chance I'm glad  I took,  because Attack of the Clones ROCKS in every sense of the word! ",0

1979,6.0,"As much as I would love to be able to say that Attack of The Clones is as good as the original three in the series, I sadly cannot.  And even more dissapointing is the realization that the prequels will never reach the type of cinematic enjoyment that the first three did. It's just not going to happen. But don't get me wrong.  Attack of The Clones is not a bad movie. It is much better then the Phantom Menace and gives us much more insight into how the Republic falls and the Empire takes over. THE GOOD:  Every scene with Palpatine is awesome.  Watching the character continue to manipulate the Jedi is fun to watch and you can tell that Ian McDiarmid is having fun playing the character. His early scene with Anakin gives us insight into the relationship the two have built since we last saw them in The Phantom Menace and when Palpatine talks about how he loves Democracy and loves the Republic it is develish evil we hear in his undertones. When Palpatine finally reveals himself as Darth Sidious in Episode III, it is going to be an awesome moment. Anakins slaughter of the Tusken Raiders camp is cool and his scene after where he tells Amidala what he did is easily the best acting scene in the Prequels.  We finally see Darth Vader in Anakins eyes and it is very compelling. Also memorable: The chase through Coruscant, Kenobi vs. Jango Fett, The Battle Scene at Geonosis, parts of the C-3PO and R2-D2 antics during the big battle scene, watching Count Dooku escape on his scooter across the desert as he is being followed by Anakin and Obi Wan (am I mistaken or did the soundtrack have undertones of the Wicked Witch of the West theme from the Wizard of Oz as Dooku is on his broom err scooter.). The BAD: The two most difficult things for a director to convey are tone and subtlety.  Lucas fails to convey both of these.  Sadly this movie that should be full of energy and emotion is dead.  Instead of experiencing the movie with the characters we are observers. This is mainly due to the weak dialogue and stale directing by Lucas.  The Flanneled One is much more interested in computer effects then he is in character development.  This is the biggest missing ingredient that seperates Episode I and II from the first three.  Also, the editing choices in the film were questionable at times.  There  is little to no tension built through out the story.  It never builds to anything emotional, it just moves on to the next scene, the next plot point.  Some scenes should have been cut out all together. The UGLY:  Anakins scene with Amidala by the fireplace is truly horrible.  The writing is sophomoric and its really quite embarrassing for both actors.  Lucas then follows this scene with what has to be the worst scene of the movie which is Anakin having a nightmare about his mother.  This scene would have worked if Lucas would have shown us a glimpse of what his dream was about and it would have served to re-aquaint the audience with Shmi before we see her death scene.  Sadly, no one mentioned this to Lucas and the scene plays horribly.  I saw the movie twice on opening day and this scene got laughs both times. All in all the movie has a lot  more good in it then bad. However I couldn't help feeling that as Palpatine and others watch the Clone Army board the Star Destroyers and The Imperial March is playing it should have been the emotional climax of the film instead of just another visual spectacle. 7.5 out of 10 but I'll round it up to 8 since it's Star Wars :-)",0

I could criticise some of the acting/dialogue/plot, but what's the point? It's a Star Wars film, it's not gonna be up for Best Acting or Screenplay Oscars.

It is great fun to watch.",1

Great entertainment all the way :)",1

I actually thought that was a good sign when I heard the title.  There was another Star Wars movie made in 1980 with an equally cheesy title: 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  Please, don't even attempt to philosophize that the EP. 5 title is superior.  People have also criticized the romance between Amidala and Anakin as being unbelievable.  There is no one alive who can say with a straight face that the God awful romance development between Han Solo and Princess Leia was any more convincing. And the dry delivery of lines?  Anyone remember, ""scruffy looking nerf herder!"" The point is, all those elements are essential ingredients to a Star Wars flick.  They were part of the original trilogy, and they are a part of AOTC. This movie is the best since EP. 5.  Period.",0

After 3 weeks or so of the release of episode II I decided to disregard my prejudices and go see the new Lucas addition to the Star Wars Saga, especially after reading good reviews about it.  To be honest, it was better than the Phantom Menace but still no where near as good as any of the old stuff.  The Characters are well defined and deep, and although I liked young `Any' my liking can't change the fact that the boy can't act, besides the image of little 'Any' in diapers being protected by Amidala made me  think along the lines of a `sinful' amoral relationship bit of child molesting on the former queen's side..ugghh.  The movie was a bit slow till the last 20 minutes. Too much animation made the set look unreal, and Youda was much bigger when he was a man in the empire strikes back.. and more real too.  In addition I would like to add a bit of `borrowing' Like the beginning of the movie the city looked very `blade runner' `the 5th element' kind.  The warms to kill the Senator were borrowed from the `Dune' Mini series, in addition to some of the beautiful Arab looking palaces in Nabu that was `Dune' too.  The asteroids field was very much `farscapish' a bit on the side of warmhole technology.

Yet he has still made a film that is much, much worse.  `Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones' is a true disappointment in every sense of the word - not merely a dismissible letdown, but a disastrous wreck that may make you uneasy as you file out of the auditorium.  And the key to understanding this film's failure is in the first two words of the title: `Star Wars.'  Sure, as an average sci-fi popcorn flick it would still be a bloated `Pearl Harbor'-ish pooch-screw, but frankly, `Star Wars' is more than `average' for most moviegoers.

2012,,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS I found this film infinatly better than The Phantom Menace. The people knocking this film are at fault here. This film succeeds on every level for me. The acting is not all that bad. It has never been a strong suit in any of the films despite having some great actors in them. The dialogue is another thing that is not always that great in any of the previous films. I thought that Hayden was quite good as Anakin. Sure some of his lines are cheesy, but you can't fault him for that. He excels in the scenes where he is allowed to show his arrogance and anger. Ewan McGregor was a little more comfortable with the Obi-Wan character this time around. If I were to change anything it would be the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett duel. It could have been longer. The conveyer belt scene just seems to commercial in the way of you know it will be part of a video game. The arena battle although was excellent I would have shortened it to make the Count Dooku/ Obi-Wan/Anakin/YODA battle longer. When it comes to that scene I will tell you that Christopher Lee is a much more menacing villain than Darth Maul. Secondly Yoda proves that big things come from small packages. A real crowd pleaser at the showing I just saw. Natalie Portman was given a better role. She no longer needs to be so stuffy as the Queen of Naboo. Again it isn't her fault for bad lines. Jar Jar Binks is there, but mercifully not much. C3PO is back in the form that you know him from the originals. With more than his share of corny puns. I would have to say that overall I enjoyed this film. Even the first hour that many are saying is slow. It may not be action packed, but it is still interesting. Things are falling into place. and it was great to see Obi-Wan following clues to find Jango Fett and all the things that come from finding him. If anything is missing it would be a Han Solo like character. The wise cracking devil may care attitude is not seen in this film at all. Another thing is the lack of any really good quotes. With the exception of two given by Obi-Wan.  ""Good Job"" as seen in one of the trailers and "" One day you'll be the death of me Anakin"".",1
2013,9.0,"This is what Star-Wars is all about.  Unlike its predecessor, Episode I, this movie actually FELT like a Star Wars movie.  There is not a single dull moment in this movie and it often left the audience cheering.  It has fantasy, drama, love, action, great score, great plot, great acting, great story line.  John William's score and its use was especially great. *Spoilers* When Anakin describes how he killed the kidnappers of his mom, we hear the Imperial theme for the first time in both the prequels. Throughout the movie, you can see how Anakin is driven further and further into hate and fear.  It was just a great movie all around and could possible rival some of the best movies ever made.  By far, my favorite Star Wars movie, and one of my favorite movies ever.  I liked it 10x as much as Lord of a Rings, a comparible fantasy movie, and I loved LOTR.  A MUST SEE. 10/10",1

2020,1.0,"Very disappointing. Episode 1 got a going over but I thought this was far worse. The acting was risible (Christopher Lee aside), the early scenes excruciatingly boring and the dialogue pathetic in places. Lucas spent too much time trying to set the groundwork for the 1st (or should that be 2nd?!) great trilogy that he produced a plodding mess.  The early chase scene was incredulous, the romance unconvincing to say the least (could it have been any more hammy or clichéd?) and Christensen, in particular, absolutely brutal. In fairness, the ""Gladiator"" scene was excellent and it picked up considerably after that, but I almost had fallen asleep at that stage. And don't get me started on accents - we had a Scot doing a poncey (and fluctuating) English accent, various US & English accents and a Kiwi bounty hunter. Surely actors can act a bit and leave their parochial accents behind for a galactic extravaganza? At least McGregor tried, in going for the English accent, which appears to be the de facto accent for fine upstanding galactic citizens (go figure!). At least we saw little of that annoying Jar Jar and thats something to be thankful for. Come on George - you can do better than this. At least get a director in that can direct actors for Episode 3.",0

Because it simply doesn't have what a good movie needs: a good script. It appears that the director George Lucas, made his new film from the technology he has. This is a film that doesn't care about it's characters, and it's apparently not interested neither in delivering things the original trilogy delivered: witty, smart and colorful dialogue. This is a movie that only cares to make things look great, to deliver some very fun action sequences, but apart from that, it fails as a good Star Wars movie. And surprisingly, the film it's not as much fun as you'd think. The first 90 minutes of the film are very boring, filled with cheesy lines in a love story that just doesn't work. Even if there is chemistry between the two actors Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, their characters are so thin, so lifeless, so boring, that I didn't cared for them or for their love story.

I defy you to explain it! Since when do Queens have terms of office? Why is Padme dressed like a dominatrix? Is it some sick(albeit appreciated) Lucas fantasy? Why isn't the Yoda/Duku fight interesting upon second viewing? Why does Yoda refer to the war as ""the clone war""? How does he know? That's like somebody saying ""Welcome to the 100 years War!""

Hayden Christensen is somehow an even worse actor than the boy in the Phantom Meanace, and even more whiny. The Plot is still confusing, and all over the place. Yet another anti-climax with Boba Fett ( I know he has a name, but I don't give a crap). And Yoda pulling out a light saber, I can go on, and on why that scene is wrong, but I won't. But hey there is less Jar Jar Binks, but in the small part he has he is responsible, for everything that happened in the Original Trilogy...... WTF?!

Obi Wan has grown his hair and Padme isn't as good as she was in Leon. The best bit is where Jango Fett headbutts MacGregor. I wanted to do the same. And there's a bit where Christopher Biggins as Count Dooku has a light sabre fight with a CGI Yoda, thats less photo-realistic than the one in the Clone Wars Animated Series. The thing that is most annoying is the romantic story between Anakin and Padme. It's such an important part of the entire saga, but only gets a few seconds here and there to develop. It seems it was more important to keep cutting to MacGregor talking to some more awful CGI 'characters', if you can call them that. It's okay though, because just when Padme has given Anakin, and the audience the feeling that he's barking up the wrong tree, she tells him she truly, deeply loves him. A classic bit of Lucas 'we've got to wrap this thing up' stuff. I have now sold my Clones and Menace DVD's on eBay, because now the actually rather good Sith is out on disc, these two are utterly pointless and unwatchable. Yes, UNWATCHABLE.",0

2034,7.0,"To get right to it, Attack of the Clones, Episode II, to me, is the weakest film in the saga. Now, don't get me wrong, there are moments that do stand out in the grand scope of the franchise, like the battle sequences and the lightsaber between Jedi Master Yoda and Count Dooku (which I do love). However, the dialogue between Anakin and Padme is really what kills me; it really is NOT good. I'm part of the minority that doesn't think Hayden did a bad job with Anakin, but his scenes with Natalie Portman can be hard to watch. Other than that, I do like the plot with the clones, although I wish Lucas would've made the decision to pick an actor to play Jango who sounded more like the actor who played Boba in the theathercial release of Empire Strikes Back, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku and, of course, Ewan McGregor's take on young Obi-Wan Kenobi!

Everyone slides into their roles perfectly, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor were already prepared for what they have to do, but the revelation is Hayden Christiensen(sic) he is the ""loose cannon"" and ""big headed"" Jedi who is learning his trade.

These guys were so noble and wise and every kid had this great respect for them. Episode 1 was bad enough but I was expecting better this time around but the hype pulled me in once again. Why am I so bitter. Kenobi was made out as a fool and Yoda was like a little toy who could pull off these weird moves. It was terrible. What was with that love story. Fair enough it had to happen but could Lucas have instilled some class into the putrid script. And what was with the scenery. Maybe I'm missing the point but i was expecting it all to look real.

Under the most intense scrutiny (which is just stupid to do), its the greatest popcorn movie ever made... and under viewing it simply because you want to, its easily one of the most fantastic romps through great movie-making ever conceived. If you're there for true emotional perfection then no, its not The Empire Strikes Back (which perfected perfection) but unless you're completely out of your mind (which I suspect these days many movie-goers and even fans are) you'll actually notice quiet a bit of really sincere, really well grounded emotion and character. When Anakin gets p***ed off... you want to be p***ed of with him. When Obi-Wan gets frustrated... hoo boy he's got good reasons. There have been the never-ending complaints over poor dialog, but I honestly didn't find this to be a problem; everything moved the story forward in complete harmony with what was happening and expressed exactly what needed to be expressed without ever becoming banal. For example, whenever Anakin tries to express his infatuation with Padme, what some might perceive as unrealistic drivel, I saw as ten years of uncontrollable obsession pitted against urgency -- he's a brash lad, and he is able to say exactly what anyone with the same feeling WISHES they could bring themselves to say. Yes, I suppose if you spend too much effort looking for problems you'll probably think the computer generated effects go back and forth from mega-superb to sub-par, but its easy to realize that in considering the scope of the story and events and such, there simply could have been no way for the technology to consistently keep up with the nearly limitless imagination and grandeur involved in this flick, and I for one am glad they didn't try to dumb some of the shots and visual ideas down to match only what they could create with the technology perfectly. Maybe I'm biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series... or maybe I simply know how to appreciate and recognize the uber-fantastic when I see it.

It made me wonder whether or not some critics are simply angry that Mr. Lucas is not ground-breaking and insightful as they _try_ to be in their reviews. It's almost like they're upset that they have to work so hard putting out clever reviews while George is resting on his laurels.",1
2079,10.0,"After queuing in line for 2 hours to get a decent seat, it was great to realise that east coast Australian audiences would be the first to see EP2 in the world. With high expectations and a roaring full house, it was easy to tell that the congregation was impressed. AOTC is a huge improvement over TPM in terms of story, characters and tone yet  like EP1, it still had the flaw of woeful dialogue. With Lucas bringing on Jonathan Hales to flesh out the script, i would of expected better dialogue throughout the film, which brought much unintentional laughter. Although the humour was actually quite funny and there were some good lines, the writing and direction of the romance scenes was quite poor and proves Lucas as much to learn on executing chemistry with characters. Acting was good allround yet Christensen wasn't 100% capable of pulling off his role which to say, wasn't helped by his dialogue. It is easily seen any flaw of acting is contributed by actors not used to delivering amidst a wall of blue screens and with Lucas not having the best skills as helping actors blend their performances through the masses of fx surrounding them, the actors try their best. As far as fx, wow. The film has brilliant action sequences with the audience constantly dropping jaws no matter how much we know it's just CGI. As for the finale and Yoda..the whole cinema just erupted in cheers and 'holy sh..s' Overall AOTC is a great film and if a little more effort had gone into the dialogue, it would have been a perfect sequel.",1

2081,5.0,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a return to the feel of the original trilogy. The characters and the story are far more interesting. The weaknesses are definitely in the dialogue and the acting between the two leads, Christensen and Portman, especially during the love story scenes. But the rest of the film is very entertaining, with striking visuals and memorable scenes. The action sequences, from chases to lightsabre battles (especially with Yoda), is Star Wars at it's best. I would place the film as my third favorite in the series behind EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR WARS.",1

2085,,"This is a good movie... if you only watched it once. To make things simple, this is not a classic and does not (absolutely postively) deserve to be in the Star Wars trilogy. Sure, its better than 'The Phantom Menace' but what isn't? The characters were better used this time, thankfully, and Hayden Christensen did a wonderful portrayal of Anakin Skywalker which really balanced the otherwise tilting movie. A couple objections to the film... first, they should've shown more of Anakin's rampage on the raiders; i mean, not all in detail, but at least enough to make you cringe. Secondly, the romance between Anakin and Amidala just wasn't happenin'... i didn't feel the connection like I did with Leia and Solo in the original trilogies and I thought the two just didn't have chemistry. The main problem with this 'so called' love was that it based the whole movie on it when it only spanned a quartet of clips. At least with Leia and Solo, it wasn't hyped up and it just happened- if Lucas did not blow the love out of proportion maybe the movie might've been better. Nonetheless, nobody can forget Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi Wan also- who in my opinion was the cream of the crop here. Some shocking moments in this film that never really happened in any of the previous Star Wars films- i won't tell but has something to do with Jango Fett and Mace Windu. Definitely was creative and delivered quite well. Also, the final lightsaber sequence with Count Dooku... guess who came to the party? Yoda! I don't think Lucas intended on making the scene funny, but not one person in the theater the 1st time I saw it, did not laugh. I don't know how to make a critique on that except Lucas did something wrong there because I am confused whether its comical or normal. Anyways, the movie was alright but not something you would want sitting on a shelf beside the ""Star Wars"" or ""Empire Strikes Back"", that's for sure. Out of 10 stars, I give it a 6. Hopefully, the next film (Episode III) will bring out dorment ""true"" Star Wars fans like myself.",1

2098,7.0,"Attack of the Clones definitely has some flaws, although it has many redeeming qualities that bolster the movie to be good. As this is a personal review, this is my subjective opinion. Feel free to disagree. I found the characters of Count Dooku, Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Darth Sidious/Senator Palpatine to be strong supports for the story. They together explained the motives for the Jedi Order and the Sith Lords in trying to prevent civil unrest/war in the galaxy and on the opposite end, trying to begin this civil unrest and use it to create an army for the Galactic Empire and take control over the Jedi and the galaxy. The backbone, however, of the entire story rests on Anakin and Padme's love story and their relationship that leads Anakin to *choose* to go to the Dark Side.",1

Allow me to explain- like phantom menace, this sequel is quite a mess with it not once again having a main protagonist like the originals, and of course the painful/clichéd love story between Padme and Anakin, as well as meshing it with CG action set pieces and bogging us down in politics. Now, I'm not gonna delve deeply into this films problems as so many others have done it wonderfully. Instead, I'm simply gonna give you the reasons why I enjoy this film as I do-",0

While it is a terrible movie, it did have a kick ass lightsaber fight at the end which Attack of the Clones just does not have, the lightsaber fight at the end of this movie is god awful. But with that out of the way here is the rest of the review...",0
2101,3.0,Haven't watched it for a second time until today. It's amazing how bad it is. It was basically filmed entirely in front of green screens and it shows. It looks so bad. The effects are bad and you really see that the actors had nothing to act with or move on. And then Anakin. That's got to be the worst acting to ever put on film,0
2102,,"The prequels are much maligned in some quarters and its easy to see why- They look fake and glossy, and nowhere is it as apparent as it is in Attack of the Clones. Another problem here is that this movie suffers from ""middle episode syndrome"" - the tendency of the second volume in a trilogy to feel incomplete and, as a result of that incompleteness, to fail to satisfy. Attack of the Clones takes the threadbare strands of plot introduced in The Phantom Menace and braids them together into what will eventually become the whole cloth for Revenge of the Sith. Still, despite several high-octane action sequences, this movie, more than any of the others in the entire Star Wars saga, feels orphaned and works considerably better when viewed as part of a greater epic than as a stand-alone production. It's setup without resolution, tease without consummation. But in order to watch the epic it must be seen.",1

Reminiscent of Empire in that it's less of a complete story than a connection between the one before and the one after, and in the division of the plot with protagonists separating.

With a plot made from Swiss cheese, and acting as stiff as the Muir Woods, you'd think that a movie with so much going on (big space battle and chase scenes, strange alien worlds) would at least keep my interest. Despite my partner's coaching to ""enjoy the world that they created,"" I found myself unable to get past the asinine writing and Annakin (that's 'Annie') Skywalker's inability to hide his Bronx accent. What happened to the Jedi? Why have they been reduced to bumbling, preachy, boring action heroes?

My 9 year old son summed up the first part of the film as ""It was boring!"".  I have to agree.  There is simply not enough chemistry between Natalie Portman (Padme) and Hayden Christensen (Anakin) to keep us interested in the story as it ploddingly shows the development of Anakin's character.  It doesn't help at all that the stylized formal speech used by the Naboo characters (e.g., Padme) comes off as wooden, and not at all natural.  Hayden Christensen does a fair job of representing the 'whiny adolescent' -- but how many people enjoy watching whiny adolescents?",0

2117,8.0,Action scenes and special effects - 10 / 10,0
2118,8.0,"Although marred by a lack of screen chemistry (and clumsy direction of romantic scenes) between Amidala and Annikan (although Annikan's fixation on Amidala is understandable, why Amidala would fall for Annikan is never established and comes across as just a deus ex machina), the film is saved by the solid individual performances of these two characters. Annikan's adolescent petulance is well-played but further deepens the mystery of why a successful adult woman would fall in love with him. The groundwork for Annikan's transition to the dark side is well laid down. But McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is the star of this movie, and the film flows best through his scenes as McGregor fills out his role to a T, and is believable as a younger version of the Kenobi we meet in Episode IV. Jackson gives a strong supporting performance and Yoda steals the show near the end. Christopher Lee does well in refraining from overplaying his villain; Star Wars was never a place for the cartoonish bad guys with the clever quips a la a James Bond or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The movie is tightly paced as the main characters split up and jumps back and forth whenever things look in danger of slowing down. Well choreographed light saber, spaceship and battle scenes gives a visceral punch to the beautifully created worlds which felt so empty in The Phantom Menace. In every respect (including the mercifully limited presence of Jar Jar Binks) this is a much better movie than Episode I and is on a par with Empire Strikes Back.",1

The action was as fantastic as we always expect from Star Wars, fast paced, flowing but unfortunately not too frequent. The love story between Anakin and Padme' was at times a little frustrating but for me just kept itself inside the lines of taste. I think Lucas has done well with a very tricky story and managed to keep the ideology of the trilogy alive. At times i felt the audience were shifted back and forth between scenes a little too much, in ep1 it built up alot before reaching the final climax, yet in ep2 the build up doesnt seem to link together as well. Id rate this just behind Empire as the best Star Wars film to date, for me it just seemed to miss something and be over too quickly. I cant complain though, the die hard fans will love it, the die hard sceptics will hate it and the people in the middle will enjoy it for all that it is, good old fashioned storytelling that packs a hell of a punch. Overall a worth the wait score of 8/10.",1

The acting was mostly wooden, going through the motions without depth or feeling. (Natalie Portman was an exception to this)People actually walked out on this movie in the theatre I was in, and I cannot say that I blamed them. After two hours of dull moviemaking, we were given a huge smash up ending with lots of dazzle, this must be what people are refering to when the say they really liked it.

This Star Wars had balance and a great feeling to it. I really enjoyed watching Ewan bring back the old Obi-Wan. Hayden Christensen makes a good Anakin because he has heart and shows the anger, rage, and bitterness that Star Wars fans would imagine that Darth Vader would have possessed at such a young age. He doesn't overdo anything or become unrealistic about his emotions(except maybe in the love scenes). Of course there was a scene in the movie where I wished that George Lucas had shown more detail. Expanding one scene in particular could have given the audience a first hand view of Anakin's growing turn to the dark side. The love story's language was little overdone and forced at times but it was sufficient for such young actors.",1

The only flaw so to speak was the terrible one line gags involving C3PO. And some poor dialogue. With that aside, Episode Two was a blockbuster action film worthy of the name Star Wars.

Lucas (the uncontested  pioneer of the special effects industry) fails to impress with his current batch of effects.  They are good but in a film industry that has given us Matrix, it's hard to get ooohhh and aaahhh ed by some (now) very basic special graphics.

But the acting was so bad, so cramped, and the story was so thin that I failed.  I guess the makers of this film believe wholeheartedly that American audiences are incapable of understanding a well-developed story; they must constantly be bombarded with FX and CGI.  It's great to have alien life forms for sci-fi films, but the ones in this movie have no more interest than paintings on the walls of the local bank.  Spider-man was pretty good, though.  Much better story and acting, anyway.",0

Hayden Christensen is a good desgruntled anakin. i have seen other movies with him, and it seems this is the role he hits right on the nose. natalie portman was not only extremely sexy but developed as a character. instead of being the monotonous character from episode 1, she is a fun loving, emotional beauty. christopher lee plays both sides perfectly, but Ian McDiarmid does it even better. the visuals in this movie blow away spiderman, the matrix and any other ""blockbuster"" movies to be released. it easily blows away films unworthy of the best visual effects award. it even rivals the lord of the rings. the dialogue between the two lovers is exactly how most young adults act and talk. yes it is cheesy at times, but isn't that the way all young lovers are? the plot was *brilliant*. the jango fett/bobba fett relationship was ingenius. watching obi-wan on his investigation was fascinating. jar jar was *not* annoying at all. c3po and r2d2 almost stole the show, but the real person who stole it (and who will be remembered for it) is yoda! nothing, not even gandalf vs the balrog, can compare to yoda fighting. i was in pure ecstatic bliss and awe. is it better than episode one? hells ya! easily! better than jedi? for sure. better than the original? in my opinion yes. better than empire? it's a tough call, but considering that lucas had very little to work with since he *had* to get in many subplots to fill in episodes 4-6 (which, btw, worked perfectly, ie. lars owen) it definetely can rival it. there are *sooo* many parallels to episode 5 (empire) that are just wonderous to watch, and the cliffhanger finalé really makes me want a lot more. only 3 more years of waiting until the circle is complete. lucas has truly made a masterpiece. ps, i can't wait to see it on pure digital screen!",1

2150,,This is one the best movies I have seen in a long time. I really enjoyed the action and the sci-fi it had in it. Wow. My favorite part was the beginning of it when Luke jumped out of the car and was just falling from no where and not one car hits him but it just seems like it. And Yoda fighting too. But Star Wars was really great till the last part of the movie came. When he lost his arm. That looked really fake (well pretty obvious) but I think that scene had to go but other than that scene it was an awesome movie and I cannot wait till the 3rd one comes out.,1

2152,,"When I saw the trailers for this film I was intrigued, actually anxious is the right adjective.  After I sat through all 2+ hours of this movie I have no idea why I was so anxious.  This movie was pretty much a chore to sit through.  Not that I hated every minute of it; the sound and special effects were amazing.  But, the movie fell flat on its face.  The story was good, the script was atrocious.  The dialogue was silly at times and the actors seemed to be lost in their delivery.  I think Lucas is a little out of touch with his directorial talents.  My biggest gripe is probably the overkill use of digital computer-generated animations.  While they may be cutting edge and may make things easier on the actors and budget, they take away from the real look the original movies had.  Yoda looked much more lifelike when he was a puppet ... also the clone army (stormtroopers of the future) weren't even real people.  At least they didn't look real to me.  Whatever happened to hiring guys to dress up in costumes instead of creating a fake ""cyber"" army.  Ridiculous.  Maybe if Lucas reverted to the technology he used back in the late seventies things would be better.  Those movies had a look to them that is totally lacking in the first two prequels.  The realistic touch and human side to the movies is gone and the digital dehumanized look of the new ones is just not welcome.  Try again George... but how about spending more money on little things like scripts and a good director.  May the force be with you.",0
2153,,"Well, having managed to miss Ep 1 at the movies, (made up for it a bit by watching it on a widescreen tv with surround) was glad I made it to the picture house for this one, which was better.  Although still not a patch on the originals, particularly Empire Strikes Back. ",1
2154,8.0,"For all Lucas' posturing that the critics meant nothing to him, he obviously listened to them because Attack of the Clones was everything The Phantom Menace was not. It was dark, brooding, forboding, complex, well-paced, well-plotted and well-acted. I was impressed at the contrast between this movie and the first.  The Phantom Menace played like the Star Wars Kid's TV Special, while Attack of the Clones is of epic proportions, on a par with Greek tragedy (not to say it was a great movie---though it was very good---but it at least TRIED to be great). Even the special effects were 100% better than TPM.  The CGI looked absolutely real in this movie...I couldn't tell from looking where the live action left off and the CGI began. One word of advice: be SURE to see this on a digital projector, because I understand the picture is often too dark and murky on conventional screens.",1

2157,6.0,"I liked Episode 1 but there were just sooooo many things about it I didn't like as well, now with Episode 2, It felt more like the return to Star Wars I wanted to see. The only problem I had with AOTC was the choppy editing and the feeling like I had missed something when some scenes begin (Hopefully when the dvd is released we'll get a lot of those cut out scenes that I think the movie really needed) Other than the bad editing the movie is fantastic! I don't know what the critics were talking about with the dialog between Anakin and Padme, I thought they were wonderful together If anything there needed to be a little more shown between the two.CH is a great choice for Anakin/Vader.Ewen ,what can you say, but he is the best of them all,well except for Yoda and you'll see why!The actors are superb! I would love to go into so much ,but I don't like to put in spoilers. I love this movie! Can't wait for Ep3!",1

I was on the edge of my seat from the moment of the very first explosion. (hope that wasn't a spoiler) Now let me clarify that Episode I was not a horrible movie at all, it just was a bit childish. Jar Jar Binks, dragged the ATOC's predecessor down that far. One improvement in Attack of The Clones is that Jar Jar has roughly five minutes in the whole movie which is a great improvement. Almost all of the great minor charecters from Episode one are back, such as Watto, the trade federation viceroy and his friend, and who could ever forget, the battle droids.",1

I had seen Phantom Menace, a few years before and was disappointed by it. However, the second that the recent addition to the Star Wars Saga began, all doubts were practically non-existant. Star Wars Episode II Attack of The Clones, though it had some minor flaws, was an excellent film as far as Star Wars movies go. It was a gigantic improvement over The Phantom Menace, which was not horrible, just not wonderful either. (too aimed towards small children) ATOC has a good solid plot, great action, a considerably lesser amount of Jar Jar, and also better charecter development than its predecessor, The Phantom Menace. These when put together make Attack of the Clones a milestone in both of the Star Wars trilogies. Not only is it better than TPM, it also makes the moments in that film that did not make sense, have a bit of meaning to them.",1

2161,7.0,Just went to see the film at the Warner Village in Cambridge and I think it's a great film. The action scenes especially. Yoda absolutely rules!! You could feel the crowd get more and more excited as the action scenes came. The love story was alright but dragged on a bit and was not very convincing but I thought Hayden did a good job as Anakin. Amidala (Portman) looks really hot and as the film progresses loses more and more clothes which I was thankful for. I think the film could surpass the Spiderman movie in it's opening weekend. Unfortunately it has been released on a Thursday meaning the first day's earning don't count towards the weekend gross. A lot of critics have slammed the film but I figure they're all wrong. Go see it whether you are a star wars fan or not.,1
2162,10.0,"Like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" before it, this ""Episode 2"" jacks the wonder up a notch. This is a film that will simply strengthen the new generations of SW fans further, while reminding original fans like myself what all the magic was/is about.

2163,,"To tell you the truth, I thought this movie was awful. I've gotten tired of Star Wars over the years, but this one I would have hated even if I had liked Star Wars. I think The Phamtom Mennace was the worst Star Wars film, but this ranks in at number 2.",0

Attack of the Clones is literally none stop action with a great plot.",0

2167,,"I went in with low expectations, having heard the film dismissed as just like Episode One (which I found pretty poor). I was pleasantly surprised. Episode II is much better PACED than the first - sure, the script still sucks but there's a plot to this one. Whereas Episode One dawdled along, leaving you with little to do but fantasise about how to kill Ja-Ja, spot the flaws in the special effects and ponder how DID that script get past editing, Episode Two keeps the action going. It gets right in there at the beginning, chases and assasinations, then maintains your interest during the slow times. So Anakin may be getting romantic (where the script gets REALLY bad), but Obi Wan is visiting a mysterious and slightly spooky alien planet.",0

Waiting for our drinks, the wife looks at me straight in the eye and says those three little words: `That movie sucked!'",1

That guy who is playing the future Darth Vader is particularly rubbish. He is so wooden, it is unbelievable. It all looks so unconvincing. I think there are computer games that look more realistic than this. The water effects are especially poor, totally unreal. They make a big mistake in using so much cgi. In fact the old films look better than this and thats just using models and old school special effects. It is such a shame that this new wave of star wars films ever got made because they don't do justice to the old movies. They were great. These new ones are crap. End of story. 1 out of 10.",0
2170,2.0,"I would guess that anyone who grew up with the original trilogy will suffer the same disappointment that I did when I viewed this film (along with The Phantom Menace). Some main points: 1)Hey George. Lay of the computer graphics. Go back to using models. They felt much more real and visceral. 2)Why does everything in the new trilogy look more modern and complex (even though this story occurs before Chapters IV, V, VI) then it does in the original trilogy. Those super sleek, shiny ships look out of place compared to the original M. Falcon and tie fighters. 3)The characters are way too serious. (Remember from The Empire Strikes Back that the young Obi-Wan had a reputation of being a problemed, rebellious student.) Now that we have the chance to see the young Obi-Wan, where is he? Ewan McGregor is way too straight-laced (he is normally a fascinating actor.) 4)Anakin comes off as a spoiled, whiny, jerk. We are supposed to see a character arc into Darth Vader, but let me tell you...Anakin doesn't have far to go. He is naturally unlikable. Finally, where is the humor?? The witty one-liners that Han Solo used to spout off and the bumbling of a naivé Skywalker.",0
2171,3.0,"My opinions on this one have evolved after seeing it once in the theatre and then again on video. I admit that the final hour was a guilty pleasure which distracted me from how painful the first hour was. Also, I came in with no expectations, because of how horrid Ep. I was. Then I watched Clones on video, and it hit me how truly awful this was. Now I didn't have the eye candy on the scale that the theatre provides...it was just me, my wife, and a lame story filled with very lame acting playing out on a 27"" screen. And it didn't work at all. I even think it might be as bad or worse than Ep. I, which I didn't think was possible. There is no lead-in for me to eagerly anticipate Episode III - only the morbid curiosity of gawking at a train wreck. The story did nothing to endear me to the characters or care about their plights. Wooden, terrible acting by Portman and her beau. These films (I & II) desperately needed some comic relief ala Hans Solo to take the attention away from the stiff, lovey-dovey crap, but there was none to be had, so I had to sit through a lot of awkward, even mind-numbingly bad moments while the two young lovers worked through their feelings.

Most of the criticism levelled at it is accurate, though I think its detractors exaggerate how bad those flaws make the film. Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars and said, ""Not a lot of heart, but certainly a lot of fun in Saturday matinée serial fashion."" I think that's the fairest appraisal I've read.",1
2175,5.0,"While Episode I left me in a complete rage, mostly due to the appearance of a rather long-eared and EXTREMELY obnoxious character, whose name I shall never utter again, I actually quite enjoyed this movie. Even though probably not for the reasons intended by it's makers. Maybe it also helped that I watched this one under influence of a few beers at a University theater, surrounded by hundreds of others who would laugh and cheer with me at the often ridiculous story and perhaps not top-notch acting. Be sure that the setting in which you are watching this movie is right (friends, beer), and you may well be rewarded with quite a few laughs. Just don't watch it alone or expect that you will see anything in a league with the original movies and you will be quite happy. Of course, this is just my humble opinion and if you are under 12 years of age, you will probably really like it anyway, until you grow and accumulate more experience (which is when you might probably wish that something really nasty would have happened to George Lucas before he could commit the Ewoks crime. Not that I would ever do that).",1

This movie has some of the worst dialogue, cgi, action, and romance I've seen in a movie since Batman and Robin. I'm not exaggerating, this movie is a poorly directed and poorly acted mess. I am genuinely shocked that it has a fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, the website that hated the masterpiece that is Fight Club when it was first released. And I really think that nobody would defend this steaming pile of crap if it didn't have the words ""Star Wars"" attached to it.",0
2180,6.0,"While Attack of the Clones suffers many problems from its predecessor, it manages to fix many of them. At times, the plot still feels out of place and lost. But nevertheless, we feel like there is an objective or a finish point that the movie seeks. The action sequences are improved, but still barely above average, except the final battle. The final battle is well filmed and visualized, and best of all feels necessary and not forced. The weakness in this movie, ironically is the main character; Anakin Skywalker. At times, you would find yourself rooting against him, which is a big flaw in any movie. Anakin's dialogue and Hayden's acting abilities make it seem like a fan movie could achieve better. The whole Naboo sequence is out of place, and the love story felt really forced and unnatural at all. There are sequences such as the attack on the sandpeople, which should've lasted longer, and it could've offered plenty more development to a much criticized protagonist.",0

I can happily watch the other SW films over and over.  I even saw Episode I six times at the theatre.  I doubt I'll go to see Clones again. What a shame Lucas doesn't let his films grow up along with his audiences.",0

2185,1.0,"Do not bother to see this movie!!!  It is definitely the worst one of the series.  The script is terrible and the acting is very bad as well.  The worst part of this movie is the love scenes involving Anakin & Amidala.  The dialog is laughably bad.  There is no chemistry between anyone.  They even tried to do some banter between Anakin & Amidala similar to Han Solo & Princess Leia, but it did not work at all.  Every character's speech is so formal.  It takes all the fun out of the film.  The special effects are alright, but it seems like Lucas is just trying to make each alien look more weird than the last.  He is making these worse instead of better.  Another terrible part is the fight scene between Yoda & Count Dooku.  The site of the little alien flipping around Christopher Lee made it look like a Tom & Jerry cartoon.",0
2186,1.0,"From the first words spoken in the movie where Padme's bodyguard says a variant of the classically crass ""we're safe"" or ""looks like we've lost them"" phrase, which comes briefly before the blatantly obvious explosion, the viewer becomes painfully aware that Lucas should be making silent movies. I can't remember precisely what it was Harrison Ford once said of George Lucas, but it was along the lines of ""If he [Lucas] could find a way to remove actors from the movie-making process then he would"". This is just one person voicing an opinion that it's difficult not to share when seeing Attack of the Clones. He has absolutely no conception of humanity. Of course I don't know George Lucas personally, but if I did I think that I would think that he is socially inept. If his real-life social interactions are the same as how he shows them in this movie, then there is something wrong with him. In Attack of the Clones he has somehow taken a group of very talented actors, and made them look like animated manakins. The class of Christopher Lee shows through this as, even in the face of such calamatous directing and script-writing, he still manages to deliver a powerful and eery performance as the Count Dooku. Overall I still enjoyed watching the movie, mainly I think because I am a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I couldn't help but cringe during every dialog. The love that was shown in the making of the first three Star Wars movies seems well and truly lost. The freshness of the relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia is only a distant memory when we are forced to watch the ridiculously crass and predictable relationship of Anakin and Padme. Whereas the first three Star Wars films were made by a man who desperately wanted to put an idea into the world, the most recent two (and presumably the next one) will have been made by a man trying to squeeze a few extra millions out of an idea that should have been left as it was...",0

Well, after finally having seen this my verdict was that while the basic story was generally strong, and the special effects absolutely brilliant in places, there were a number of glaring weaknesses which moderately crippled it. The strengths were that it felt far more like Star Wars than the previous effort - the scenery was breathtaking and it encompassed the 'familiar yet alien world' that Star Wars has always used. ",1

Notably (or should I say regrettably):  1.  All the times where Anakin openly disrespects Obi-Wan.  Good grief - there must have been SOME discipline in his 10 years of training.  2.  A senator in a republic 'appointing' a useless toolbag to sit in for her and instigate legislation that will ultimately bring years of war.  3.  Public executions being held in a tremendous outside arena (where did the rain go?) and in medieval fashion.  Why didn't Dooku just kill Obi-Wan when he was in bondage?  4.  Amidala falling out of a moving vehicle, knocking herself unconscious, then suddenly waking up and running to save Anakin.  Right. 5. Why does Yoda limp around if he's as agile and dexterous as we see in the fight scene?

My stand out favorite scenes are with Yoda. Gave it a 9. Great movie.,1
2204,10.0,"Being a rather big STAR WARS fan, i was extremely happy when viewing this film.  It fit nicely with the OT (original trilogy) by using many more inclosed sets.  It was as big and open as TPM was.  It captured the same essence and 'force' that Episodes 4, 5, & 6 all have.  It's filled with emotion and wonderful shots of the start of the CLONE WARS.  Anakin is nearing his faithful down fall to Vader.  Obi-Wan is becoming more and more of that mindful old man we see in A NEW HOPE.  This film has it all, including many good jokes/puns by C-3PO near the end, which makes the line ""WITH ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, IT'S AMAZING WE'RE IN AS GOOD OF CONDITION AS WE ARE"" in EPISODE 4 more understandable and reminisciant.",1
2205,7.0,"After being a huge Star Wars fan since I was old enough to walk, it's no surprise that I saw Star Wars Episode II in it's entirety within it's first 3 days of release 3 times. I saw Episode I 3 times too, just in over 4 months instead of 3 days. Needless to say, Episode II jumps leaps and bounds over Episode I. This is the Star Wars movie everyone has wanted to see. Star Wars was meant to be dark, and best when darkest (ex. The Empire Strikes Back), and Episode II is the start of a dark era in the series, and if done as it truly should be, Episode III should make things downright evil. While ""Attack of the Clones"" isn't a good point for outstanding dialogue, it is a story to be told, and one that is visual nirvana. You see Anakin going bad, Jango Fett and the origin of Boba Fett, and yes, you finally will get to see Yoda fight! What more can a Star Wars fan ask for?",1
2206,6.0,Episode II: Attack of the Clones is fine sci-fi entertainment and a definite improvement on its predecessor. But does it deserve the Star Wars brand name?,1
2207,9.0,"AOTC was a brilliant film, I loved it from the instant I saw it: the saber battles are fresh, Yoda gets action, Anakin starts turning into Vader; it's all good, or it would be if it wasn't for Anakin and Padme's continual love scenes. There is just too much of - ""Ani, I love you, no wait! I don't! Oh, sorry, yes I do!"" and - ""I don't like sand, it's all sandy, unlike you, you're not sandy""(NOT ACTUAL QUOTES). I think this film had potential to be the best film in the Star Wars series but George an' his buddies partially ruined that by having too much 'Love **COUGH** Scenes'. Everything else is spot on with a crowd pleasing Jedi unite scene on Geonosis and a climatic ending with Yoda showing his wall-bouncing moves. Over all a great bit of fun - well worth watching, but not if you haven't seen any of the other films!",1
2208,8.0,"I was not having very high expectations for this movie. After the horrible Episode I, I was worried if the series was going to be lost forever. After seeing Attack Of The Clones, I was rather more pleased. This film delivers the goods enough to make it worthy of being recognized as a Star Wars film. It is good to say we can think that Episode I probably never existed! This film has far more ties with the origional three than Episode I ever will. It harkens back to darker themes, primarily conspiracy, assassination, forbidden love, and war. The film runs about 2 and a 1/2 hours, and is breathlessly filled with awesome action and adventure. It has some chills, and thrills, and top notch effects that make Episode I look like childs play. As the only spoiler I'll mention, Jar Jar Binks is only in the film for four minutes, and his pathetic comic antics have NO MAJOR ROLE in this film! I think Lucas payed attention when the real fans that scorned Jar Jar for the stupidity he represents. The real comic substance of Artoo D2 and Threepio makes a triumphant return in this film! The acting has a mixed feel to me. Some of it was done well Hayden Christiansen. He dose bring the troubled Anakin Skywalker out well in some scenes. Some of the time he acts too much like a complaining teen. Natalie Portman portrays a better Padme. She is more daring and mature in this film. She has dispensed her monotone lines for a more diversified language that we all speak. She also plays more into how princess Leia' s personality is. Ewan Mcgregor is still a top notch Jedi. He hits a home run for his role. Christopher Lee as the sinister Darth Tyranus is also top notch! He is cold, calm, yet very taunting and ruthless. Samuel L Jackson also hits a major home run as Mace Windu! Some lines of the film are a little cheesy, but adequate. Lucas dose need to iron out harder performances if he wants to equal Empire Strikes Back. The action in all the battle scenes, and chases, all payoff very well. They have the full adrenaline rush of the other films. You harldy have time to catch your breath! The story is ironed out well with this film and plays well with it! For people who go to see film for crtical purposes, shut up and enjoy! Don't spoil it for those who just want to have fun at the movies. It may have subtle flaws, and it might not be equal to the origionals, but it is a repenting prayer for the mistakes of Episode I. Yoda fans will also be very pleased and talk about his best scene for years to come after this film!",1
2209,5.0,"Yep, I saw Ep2 last night and to save you the suspense: it sucks! At least I think that would be the opinion of any frequent cinema go-er.

I say that this movie gave a lot of more comnedy in it, love, warmnes, saddness, and Sci-Fi Action. The chosen one Hayden Christensen is the one who really made this movie what is really is. He played a role of young Anakin Skywakler that would put this Canadian actor on the map.His good Looks to (his so cute).

There are a few problems with the script, and the acting is stiff in places, but George Lucas has, for the most part, succeeded with creating a visually compelling, dramatically focused, and very emotional film.  Much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Lucas has dwelled into darker territory with ""Clones"", as we begin to see Anakin Skywalker's inevitable descent to the Dark Side. We also get to see the beginning of the end for the Galactic Republic, and its transformation into the Empire.",1
2218,,"Just like all the other star wars films, this is a highly entertaining and interesting film.  It transports the audience into an amazing story by using incredible scenery, costumes, effects, sounds, and music.  The only legitimate complaints are with script and overuse of CGI.  When comparing to the original trilogy, there is a slight lessening of identifiable characters.  The prequels have more emphasis on politics and the tonality of the dialogue is more monotonous.  The story is still strong but unlike the originals, the dialogue is a bit weak to carry the story.  The CGI is amazing to watch and the detractors are correct when claiming this movie to be like a video game.  However, what is disregarded is that films combining CGI and real physicality are kind of new.   For this dilemma, a real-model/CGI combo should be suggested.  After all, there is something magical about the models and puppets seen in the originals and ILM can create some of the most astounding CGI.  Still, this slight degradation of quality in terms of script and overuse of CGI should be accepted because nothing has come close to a production with this scope and diligence to continuity.",0

I will agree, the story is much better than the first but, they are both just as good as the original 3 episodes.",1

Its like they had a specific spot off in the distance somewhere and told her to stare at in and deliver her lines with as little personality as possible.  How is Padme?  Unless in episode 3, it is discoverd that she is a robot or a clone. This is just one exmple I picked of how aweful this movie is.  Is is emotionaless, dull, unoriginal, painful.   Natialie Portmans acting is a microcosm for what the movie stands for.   Something that just stands there and hope to god that their costume is enough to make the scene exiting.",0

George Lucas is a master story teller and continues to revolutionize film making. The visual artistry of this film is breathtaking and is to be commended. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is a triumph not only as an installment of this epic series, but stands alone as a truly masterful film. Gotta run, I'm going to see it again. :-)",1
2231,1.0,"1st and Foremost I AM A HUGE STAR WARS FAN, with that out of the way.  I got to see A.O.T.C.,  and dont be fooled, believe me this movie is a far cry greater movie than Episode 1, but all this Talk bout Hayden C. and Natalie Portman being a good actors??  Come on lets get real, Hayden delivers Every line is like he is reading a cue card, on top of that some places he sounds like he doesnt even care.  Portman is the same, says everything in mono-tone and does the same thing Hayden does, and there is no Chemistry whatsoever between them.  Everyone else is AWESOME in it, my next complaint is the lines given to Hayden, he sounds Whiney, his character whines alot and its repetitive.  The plot is better in this movie, But BY NO MEANS IS IT BETTER THAN EMPIRE!!!!!!  Some parts lag and drag out, I almost fell asleep, Obi Wan (I usually dislike Ewan Mcgregor) playing detective stole the movie, it actually out shines the love story.  Beware the Love story in this movie isn't like the one in Titanic, so dont expect that.  The love story could have been better so much better, but with the lines the actors were given it was VERY unconvincing.  On a last note I wish a real actor was hired to Play Anakin someone who possess acting talent and not just for looks which Hayden was obviously hired for, not his fault.",0
2232,7.0,"If it wasn't for Master Yoda in this movie, it would've been another dull action-packed mess with very bad acting.  Even though the Anakin Amadala romance was to blossom, I felt it was not very convincing until close to the end.  Ewan McGregor was good, so was Samuel L. Jackson, but Yoda is the master of this ""Star Wars"" adventure.  That is a well worth full-paid ticket reason to go see this movie.",0

Only *might* because I'd seen Phantom Menace. Within half an hour I knew I'd been cheated again. No character development, no script, nothing but special effects. The 'love' between young Darth & Portman is appalling ..'you're not like sand, sand is coarse..' etc, his transition to evil simply not credible. How sad to see something die like this; Star Wars used to be fun. When I look at the films I saw as a kid, there's no comparison. Who writes this stuff? I don't think I'll bother with Episode III at the cinema. Of course there will be a tidal wave of hype; you must see it at the cinema, it's better than the last two and so on, but it won't make any impression on me.

Ewa n McGreggor is also electrifying(just like stephen segul in Exit Wounds)I dont get why ebert gave this 2/4 stars though,its such a great movie,which is easily comparable to Escape from L.A. This is (in my opinion) the best Star Wars movie yet. The old ones had the worst actors like Mark hamill,he's so bad!

Separatists, including the Trade Federation are striking to rebel against Republic Control with a huge army of even more advanced battle droids.

An almost complete lack of Jar Jar Binks, increased action sequences, better acting and actors and most importantly a much better script. The film is not without its flaws, but never the less it is quite an achievment that all will enjoy. Personally I still feel that ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are superior but this film far supercedes ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Return Of The Jedi."" With plotlines being carefully interwoven, loose ends being tightened up and new questions being raised I feel this feel will stand the test of time and prove that George Lucas has indeed not lost his touch. All he needed was to get back in the swing of things.",1

This is because George Lucas took a generation when they were young and captured their imaginations, passion, and interest with a story that had action, drama, mystery, all in a universe of his own design.  Approximately 25 years after Star Wars:  A New Hope, we have the fifth movie, the second of the story that has now a built in audience of grown-ups who like to reminisce about their child-hood.

2249,,"After putting us through the Phantom Menace Lucas is starting to get it right with this, but its still some way off the original trio. AOTC is not a complete waste of time, the battles are good and the story is starting to fit together with the originals nicely. But there is more to dislike, the original films had character, charm  and magic in spades and these prequels are sterile and life-less in comparison. This is down to the rubbish characters, Portman and Christensen are awful at best as the main focus of this movie (acting and dialogue), only McGregory pulls his weight and his detective work in the first half keeps the film watchable. The CGI is the other main problem here. It might work on droids and space battles but the aliens and backgrounds just look bad, the bit in the droid factory feels like it was added so Lucas could churn out a video game based on it (it looks like a game already) and Yoda looks like and extra from Toy Story. I love Star Wars but watching these is depressing",0
2250,,"Contains Spoilers!!! I remember when the first 3 Star Wars movies came out, reading several times that George Lucas intended them to be the middle 3 films of a 9 film series. The next 3 films would deal with events before ""A New Hope"" and the last 3 would cover what happens after ""Return of the Jedi.""  When ""Phantom Menace"" came out I then heard he never said that--i guess it was just a rumor--and only wanted to do the original 3 movies.  Considering the troubles he went through just to get a studio to produce ""Star Wars"" it makes sense.  The script was turned down by every major studio in Hollywood, and only bought by 20th Century Fox because of the success they had with the Planet of the Apes movies, and also because the studio head, David Ladd, was a big fan of both ""American Graffiti"" and science fiction (he later formed his own studio which produced ""Outland"" and ""Blade Runner"").",1
2251,6.0,I saw Star Wars: Episode II - Attack At The Clones at the midnight screening...and wasted my money. For a big budget movie like this you would have thought Lucas the creator of one of the best Sci-Fi movies in history could have come up with a better plot and graphics. The clone troopers look crap.,0
2252,6.0,"George Lucas is in danger of becoming the C.B. deMille or Stanley Kramer of his generation: a producer who insists on miscasting himself in the director's chair.  This picture shows off what George does best - creating eye defying visuals of a fantasy landscape.  Some of the vistas in this film - the cityscape, the clone factory and the terrain rushing by in the final chase are truly breathtaking.  Unfortunately we also get George at his worst - writing clunky dialogue and failing to coax even moderately engaging perfs from his attractive and talented cast.  Okay, Hayden Christensen lacks for talent, but the rest of the cast should have carried even him.  The result is a fantastic looking, but dramatically frustrating film. I wanted the leads to shut up and quit blocking the scenery - never a good sign in a film where the central romantic plotline is crucial to the overall drama.",0
2253,5.0,"Maybe I'm in a minority but I really didn't think this was an improvement on the hugely disappointing Phantom Menace, in fact I probably enjoyed this less. Star Wars shouldn't be boring but the first two episodes of the prequel trilogy most definitely are. Apart from marginalising Jar Jar Binks, Lucas again produced a lacklustre movie that failed to live up to the high standards of the original trilogy. It's amazing how everything came together for the original trilogy whereas this time Lucas makes one bad decision after another- probably not helped by yes men such as producer Rick McCallum. After unforgivably starting with Anakin as a child in the first prequel, Lucas then fails to pick an actor without the necessary gravitas or spark to breathe life into the character, instead we get Hayden Christenen, just as wooden and charmless as Jake Lloyd. Of course the actors job isn't helped by the appalling dialogue and Lucas surpasses even himself in writing some of the most vomit inducing lines ever to be inflicted on an audience. The romance between Anakin and Padme suffers the worst, with some truly cringe worthy scenes that are painful to watch. A far cry from the Han and Leia relationship which was a million miles away from the forced and charmless union of Ankin and Padme. One of the main reasons I looked forward to the prequels was the chance to see the hinted at Clone Wars. After being denied that in the first movie the audience is again left to rue a missed opportunity. Instead the film takes forever to set up the Clone Wars with Obi Wan Kenobi going on some dull mission which makes no sense to most viewers, whilst there's a lot of politicians on Coruscant arguing about whether they should or shouldn't have an army. To add insult to injury we find that when the Clonetroopers do finally appear their CGI'd rather than the good old fashioned real living breathing Stormtroopers of old. The effects on a whole seem to be worse than that of The Phantom Menace. There's a lot of shoddy effects,with the end battle feeling like a computer game. Christopher Lee pops up as Count Dooku and gives the film some much needed weight, but its a case of too little too late. The simple fact is the prequel trilogy could and should have surpassed the originals, it has a stronger story, a greater character arc, tragedy and a boot load of action, instead Lucas has frittered it away. The man who's genius bore the story of Star Wars makes a real mess at creating the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire. If he had worked with a good screen writer, got the script polished and used different directors like he had before I'm in no doubt the Prequels would have been a triumph. Sadly that was not to be.",0

What is even more mind boggling is that he wrote all of the Original Star Wars scripts, which were really good. Something went wrong. 2) Hayden Christiansen ruined the movie for me, him and the disgusting dialogue. I thought his character was FAR too whiny. His acting also needs some work to say the least. And finally 3) The special effects controlled the movie and overshadowed the story line. George Lucas needs to take a lesson from Peter Jackson on how to not let CGI control your film. I hope Lucas also knows that the only reason that his new Star Wars films made any money or got any recognition, was because of the old ones. When Episode I came out, everyone went to see it because they remembered how good the old ones were. That is the same case with II and III. Everyone was hoping that maybe, just maybe, THIS new one might be good. Alexander Smith",0

2260,9.0,"Lucas returns to the real world!  What a way to come back with possibly the second best Star Wars film of them all (after Empire). Empire's darkness returns as does the more varied pace and non formula plot. The sweeping, all conquering music score is back once more after a weakish 1st episode.  Christensen is superb as Anakin, if limited by an overall simplistic dialogue.  There's a dangerous, sinister undercurrent beneath the good looks, which makes the closing scene all the more unsettling.  We know where they're heading, but they don't.  Yet!  Portman and McGregor can't quite rise above the material, lacking the dynamism of Christensen.  Two much CGI in places, and the Coruscant scene is a little overlong and far-fetched.  But the battles are first class, particularly the closing conflict.  And Christopher Lee is supreme as Dooku.  Never has an actor belied his age (almost 80) to such an extent.  Roll on part 3, but do we have to wait three years? And George: Make a final trilogy!  You'll see it in your dreams!",1
2261,10.0,"I had the pleasure of watching Star Wars: Episode II at a premiere here in Malaysia. I must say its another masterpiece of George Lucas storytelling. Unlike Episode I, the new movie delved into the Star Wars saga, the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker. There are some surprising moments and revelations in this new movie to tell it now, its like telling Darth Vader was Luke's father on the premiere of Empire Strike Back. All I can say is that the movie will draw the audience slowly into the deepening plot in the first 30 minutes, bear with it, because I suppose it has to be dramatic, and its all about the characters. From then on, its all light sabers clashing and starfighters dog-fighting in the universe that George Lucas conjours out like magic.",1

2264,1.0,"Star Wars has lost its edge. The fantasy, the excitement, the anticipation seems to be in a galaxy far far away. Attack of The Clones was Lucas showing off his CGI muscles and forgetting completely about the characters that many have grown to love.",0
2265,,"Computer Generated Imagery (CGI to those who haven't been living under a rock) is a tool, not a means to create a film.  George Lucas needs to realize this; because not only would it give his films a more realistic quality but it would remedy many of the problems that plagued EPISODE I, and unfortunately carried on to plague the latest installment, STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  Don't get me wrong, I loved EPISODE II, and I think that many of the problems from EPISODE I were improved upon, however many were not.  But, I digress, let me discuss a little of the positive. First of all, the movie was much better than EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE. The story was more complex, the acting was better, the tone was darker, and as many fans requested, Jar-Jar Binks was reduced to little more than an important cameo. This you can all see for yourself when you view the film.  Let me go into more depth with the negative, which is often a little more difficult for the die-hard STAR WARS fan to pick up on at first because they are so overwhelmed at seeing a new Star Wars movie on the big screen. (I know, I too loved EPISODE I when it was first released).  The vast majority of the problems with ATTACK OF THE CLONES are the result of abusing the power to create images digitally.  For the last half hour or so of the movie you can easily forget that you are watching a live-action movie and think that you are watching WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT PART II.  There are a handful of live actors interacting with CGI characters in a CGI world, and the result is very distracting.  Christopher Lee's character, Count Dooku, riding a speeder (in front of a blue screen) looks like the Wicked Witch riding her bicycle in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  This is the first time that our little green Jedi friend Yoda is created entirely using CGI techniques, and we end up losing a substantial amount of his character.  Even if you can't quite place your finger on it, you can tell that something is definitely amiss.",0
2266,,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES is one of the most consistently dazzling movies I have seen in years, and it was probably an okay picture until it ended.

I can imagine Samuel Jackson coming up to him during filming and asking him how he should play a scene with Lucas replying ""Do whatever Sam, I'm trying to figure out how many weird looking aliens I can get in this shot.""  When very respectable actors such as Jackson and Natalie Portman cant bring something to a role then there is something wrong.

After that annoying brat in Ep I, it's nice to see the good/evil struggle in Anakin. Haydn did really well with some horrible dialogue and I really felt he could become Darth Vader. His speech after the Tuscan raiders massacre was cold and perfectly delivered. Perhaps it was just me, but some of the shadow shots of Anakin even made him look like Darth Vader.

It's not just rose-tinted nostalgia for the old films that makes me dislike this one so much - i can see the good bits, but they are far too few and lost in a sea of CGI crap. I don't want to watch 100 computer generated guys fight another 100 computer generated guys..... when they actually got into some one-on-one lightsabre action with Dooko (or whatever his bloody name was) was much more like it...... If Lucas wants to focus on the lovey dovey bit, fine by me - BUT at least find a pair of actors who have something resembling chemistry.  I found it impossible to believe that Portman and rubbish bloke had any feeling whatsoever for each other - it was like watching droids kiss, it was so mechanical. And if this is indeed a kids film, i wonder how many 8 year-olds out there are itching for heavy discussions about inter-planetary politics.... OK, there were some very pretty CGI bits, but the minute a human actor was in the midst of it the effect was ruined - it reminded me of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, only not as funny.  We liked the Millenium Falcon because it was wobbly and the actors were actually in it, we don't want shiny silvery things that exist only on a hard-drive. This rant appears a bit form-less and random, so I'll shut up now. I hope you all enjoy the film, but doubt you will.",0

Yes, I understand that this movie was a Star Wars film and thus it is hard to be totally subjective about it because of the past achievements of the holy trilogy. But please! I will be subjective despite my absolute reverence of Lucas' accomplishment in episodes 4-6. The plot was interesting and succeeded in tying in the generational connection between characters (Skywalkers, Fetts, etc...) Visually, this movie was also one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever had at a movie theater. Beyond that, its all downhill. The writing was a complete abomination of cliches that made characters that we are supposed to legitimately care for appear as nothing more than a big book of recycled hollywood drivel. The topper for me was that line comparing sand to the smoothness of Naboo followed by the awkward moment where Anakin starts feeling up Padme.

While Phantom Menace was almost childlike in its giddiness, Attack of the Clones begins to delve into Anakin Skywalker's dark motives for turning to the dark side.

But slowly, everything I loved about star wars is being destroyed. George says its for Kids but many of us are those children who grew up with star wars being such a positive, influential factor in our lives. Ruining it now is ruining some people's childhood memories and what we all believed Star Wars to be. Explaining the force? It was supposed to be spiritual. Something only a few were capable of but that anyone could achieve if they tried hard enough. Stormtroopers are clones?That is the worst. Not recruits from all over the galaxy? Everyone knows each other? For anyone on the Star Wars crew, Star Wars originally was great because you felt like you were watching real space ships, real creatures, and real people.

I won't give away anything for the sake of those who haven't seen it, but let me just say this: If you are avoiding this movie because you didn't like The Phantom Menace, go see it! Anakin is far better than he was in the last movie, what little bit there is with Jar Jar is a more restrained Gungan. And the new characters are really cool.  Count Dooku is great, and Jango Fett rules!  I was really worried about seeing Boba Fett as a young boy, worried that it might be Jake LLoyd all over again, but little Boba is really cool.

In correlation with the Star Wars saga then it is just about passable as a film that keeps the momentum of the precedent films going. However, as a film in itself it is a lame, laughable attempt at a summer blockbuster. It fits the codes and conventions of all big-budget Hollywood movies(this is not a compliment), the majority of the budget was clearly spent on the action sequences, which to be fair, are the best in any of the Star Wars films. However, the screenplay was so terrible that it would look out of place in an American daytime soap opera. There is one crucial thing that George Lucas must realise; George,YOU CANT WRITE SCRIPTS AND YOUR EAR FOR DIALOGUE IS NON-EXISTENT!!!(There, now I'm vented). Also I have to know what Lucas was smoking when he cast Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.I thought Jar-Jar Binks was as bad as it got in Star Wars, I was tragically wrong. In another review of this film, it said that Christensen acted as if he had just come out of Dawson's Creek. I find that statement far too complimentary (and anyway, I like Dawson's Creek!).I found his performance more immature and childish than Jake Lloyd's in The Phantom Menace, he behaved like a spoilt kid who didn't get a Playstation 2 for Christmas. It fills me with trepidation that Christensen will be reprising the role in Episode III, I don't see how he can convince when he makes the transformation from Anakin to Darth Vader. ",0
2296,7.0,"This movie exactly fits the expectations set by the four preceding Star Wars movies. The acting is mediocre at best, grating against the cheesy script: for example, in a near death situation, Anakin states, as though it were the most serious thing in the world, ""I have a bad feeling about this."" The graphics are, of course, incredible, and the adrenaline rushes were worth the $5.75 entrance fee, and some of the scenery was fabulous, but if the movie had to stand on its own without being part of the Star Wars mania, it would be barely memorable at all.",0

Thankfully, the movie comes across finishing with flying colours.  That's not to say the movie isn't without flaws.

Cheesy, unbelievable love plots, horrible whiny acting from a kid (Christensen) who has done wonderful acting before (Lucas killed his talent with horrible directing), and over-use of special effects made this movie annoying to watch.  I don't think I saw a single seen that didn't use CGI.  I'll give credit to the final battle seen... that was pretty well done, but all the junk thrown in before that was boring and a visual nightmare... overall, very forgettable.

The plot is pure Star Wars, with no attempts to be any more or less, and no apologies.

I understand people perceive things differently, but I just wonder, what was it about the originals that Star Wars fans liked, that made them huge fans?  Is it just the fact that people carry light sabers, or that when blasters are fired they make a certain sound that is unique to Star Wars movies?  Or maybe because they were movies that used the word ""Force.""  If that's the reason, then Episode II delivers.

I am beginning to hate movies with CGI in them because thats all the creators are worried about.... look how pretty that city looks screw the small scenes. I know the big debate is star wars or Spiderman, and i have to say spiderman triumphs where star wars fails the small scenes. These are the scenes that make a movie very good or can leave a movie (like this one) seemingly flat and fake.

I can't imagine that any budding young jedi feeling The Force coursing through his veins could resist Natalie Portman.  However, did we all forget the ludicrous age discrepancy that existed between our young love birds.  As Anakin has obviously aged his appropriate ten years, our dear Amidala seems to be right where we left her.  This has one positive attached to it, and that is the realization that if Portman's character had actually appeared to age ten years, then the filmmakers would not have been able to pull off the sexy action vixen role that she fell into once the fighting began.  How amazing is it that she goes from Senator Amidala wear to Pop Star bimbo?  I can appreciate it for what it is, but certainly a distraction.  Was it an attempt to give a basis for the hutzpah of Princess Leia?  I hope so, although it was poorly done. I greatly enjoyed watching Yoda kick butt.

2318,7.0,"Sorry Folks, After sitting through this most recent installement I can only think of how I have seen most of this before.  The massed troops in Ants, the flying craft scenes in a Bruce Willis movie of a few years back, and the saber battles in any Hong Kong Kung Fu Movie.  Great special effects but nothing really new.  No magic like the orignal Star Wars. The Doc",0
2319,10.0,"AOTC, goes back to what made Star Wars great. The acting is great, the story and plot are even better. This is a movie to see more then 2. The best part of the movie is at the end you go, No there has to be more it can't stop here, it leaves waiting and wanting Episode 3.  Without giving too much away, I will just say, this movie ties lots of the loose ends, and you see things are connected in ways you never thought possible.",1
2320,,"All right, I was very disappointed with Episode II, but even more so with the fact that it has over an 8 on IMDB.  I was completely turned off by the fact that the entire movie was shot on a sound stage.  Every scene was ruined for me by the insane amounts of computer graphics.  The real achievement in this movie was the graphics and special effects.  The tech guys that worked on this stuff should be the ones getting to appear on Jay Leno and the late night talk shows because im sure they put in far more work than anyone else did.  I work on movies myself and have done some basic 1-2 minute light saber fight sequences.  This alone would take around 40 hours to edit.  I can't imagine the frustration and time it would take to do all of the computer generated backgrounds to get the to line up on the blue alpha mats to match the pace at which the actors were moving.  It was as if George Lucas found that he could get more reliable actors if they were churned out by 80 computer techs working in a little room who will receive little recognition for the movie at all.  This however may have been true going by the very, cough cough, talented acting ability of Hayden Christensen.  I mean what a lucky guy he is, here is a guy who isn't that great of an actor and he gets put in a Star Wars movie.  Something many of us have dreamed about our entire lives.  And then on top of that he gets to make out with Natalie Portman.  Blah.  I only wish I could move to Hollywood and fumble over all of my lines and get to swing a light saber.  Anyway, I think I would give this movie a 4 at best.",0
2321,,This is worthy of the Star Wars name. I am not going to go on about the Phantom Menace as much as I'd like to.  A film that when it was released did very well only because of the Star Wars badge and not because it was any good.,0
2322,,"Yes once again we get an extremely long film, trying to tell the story of where everything began leading up to STAR WARS. It certainly had no heart to it or chemistry was visible between any of the stars, why or why or why do we bother? Reliance on special effects again. TELL THE STORY. Give me the money I will do it better and better acted too. Yes I'm an actor and no I'm not bitter, I'm good and I and a few of my mates, actors and techno guys could have done better. Only Christopher Lee was the best in this.",0

2325,8.0,"The hype was definately there for this movie. I was at a theater here in Henrietta (Regal Henrietta) and all 18 showings sold out. But the film didn't live up to it. It was good, but that's because it was saved by the last hour. Most of the movie was boring and the acting was pitiful. But acting in all of the Star Wars movies has been bad. Hayden Christianson is an unknown, and judging by his acting in this, he will only be known as Darth Vader in his acting career. Natalie Portman wasn't much better as Padme. I guess George Lucas is to blame. If it were up him, I think he would rather have the next one with no actual humans acting. Ewan Mcgregror does a good job as Obi-Wan. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this than he did just stroking his chin in The Phantom Menace, but once again, he is doing Lucas lines. I was waiting for him to tell Christopher Lee ""Can you dig it"", like he was Shaft. Speaking of Christopher Lee, he was very good in the short time he was in the movie. The best character in this movie was Yoda. YODA?!!!! That midget? This film proved why he is bad-ass. A character that should have been use more was the Emporer, I mean Senator Palpatine, I mean Chancellor Palpatine, I mean Darth Sideous. His theme music is cool. Another theme song used in this film is the best theme of the Star Wars movies, The Imperial March, courtesy of Annakin and the Clone Troopers. Boba Fett was cool, even though he is only 8-years old, and Jango Fett is a character not to get too attached to. Jar Jar Binks is only in the movie for a couple of minutes, but he does one of the biggest things in the Star Wars movies. The japanese alien, Nute gunray (the Visceroy) is only in it a little bit. All in all, the movie is an 8 out of 10.",0

Ewan does an awesome job as obi-wan, and yoda done as CGI looked VERY good in my opinion!",1
2328,5.0,"I grew on Star Wars, like many other denizens of the galaxy. The original film went out when I was 7, and is of course a masterpiece; The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi made their impact on my young mind later on, and were worthy sequels. They were fun to watch, had a compelling plot, interesting twists, great action, cool special effects, and you could identify with the good characters and hate the bad guys. Return of the Jedi was a bit cheesy - a kind of Soap Opera meets the Muppet Show - but all in all, things made sense. I love watching the trilogy from time to time, and reflect on the good old days.",1
2329,9.0,"I just saw Episode II, and unlike the masses, I really liked it!  It isn't the most action-packed movie I've ever seen, but it's definately worth seeing, it's very interesting and explains a lot if you've seen the 4th through 6th episodes.  The one thing I really found upsetting was Hayden's performance as Anakin.He just didn't convince me, I felt like I was watching an amatuer on screen...Maybe his performance was supposed to be confusing, hinting at his inner turmoil...either way, great movie! Can't wait until the next one comes out!",1

2331,9.0,"I saw this movie as soon as I possibly could. I wanted to see before the rest of my family so that I could brag to them about how dissapointed I was with it. I thought that it was a great film, but it could have been a better film if certain things were done different. I think that the film had it moments, don't get me wrong it was great, but I was so dissapointed that Yoda was done by CGI. I really enjoyed when Yoda was a puppet because to me he seemed more relatable and had more personality then his flat counterpart. The fight at the end was fantastic. I really enjoyed the light saber action at the end. It made up for the rest of the movie. Another thing that I liked that Hayden Christiansan (I think I spelt his last name wrong) played Annikan (I think I spelt that wrong too). It is nice to see a felow Canadian play an important role in a movie like this. Other things that I thought were wrong were some of the graphics. I think that a elementry student could have done better graphics. Even though I was dissapointed with this I am still going to buy the DVD when it comes out.",1
2332,4.0,Not really anything to write home about; not as dissapointing as Episode I but still far away from the original movies.,0
2333,,"I would like to introduce Attack of the Clones. The story is a fictional movie. The story is setted 10years after ""The Phantom Menace"", and the main characters are Anikin Skywalker (who has become a Hedi), Obi-wan Kenobi, Padme Amidala(as a senator), and Count Dooku. The story starts when Count Dooku tries to kill Padme with his subordinate, and Anikin and Obi-wan rescues her. Meanwhile the the two Hedi's find out that Dooku was trying to start an attack against the Republic. How ever the Jedi's don't have enough power to fight against his droid army, so they decide to use the clone warriors. The story leads to a final battle between the droids and the clones. For a good point of the movie the story is very action-packed exciting film , the actors have done great work, and the CG's are great.Also you can see how Anikin and Padame fall in love, so it can be a touching movie. However for a bad point, the story may be confusing for people who have never seen the STAR WARS, and there are many violence scenes through the film.",1
2334,,"Back in my dark days of editing, there would come a story where words failed.  We would look around the table, desperate to find something, some way to be positive about the manuscript before us.

2335,,"It is interesting to note, that in these uncertain political times, creators of texts are turning more and more to themes that hark back to our darkest times; in this case, war.  Charlotte Grey (2002), Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Thin Red Line (1998), We Were Soldiers (2002) all attempt to make sense of the futility of war and the effect on the human spirit. We have since had The Lord of the Rings (2002) in which the effects of the Industrial Revolution have inexorably led to a greater global conflict. On television, programmes like The Cazalets (2001) and The 1940s House (2001) have explored the effects of World War II on the ordinary citizen.  In the first Star Wars (1977 - 1983) films, George Lucas had referenced the causes and effects of World War II.  Now he gives us Star Wars Episode 2: The Attack of the Clones (2002) in which, he attempts to lay some blame on the politicians who draw society into the trap of war.",1
2336,5.0,"The new star wars is a long bad movie, is has too many cgi shots and few or none emotions, you feel sometimes watching a documentary about space politics, even that the cgi shots are good, you don't feel any real connection with the characters or the story, terrible acting and bad direction, if George Lucas plans to do a special edition my advice, cut 30 minutes of the movie or more keep the action parts.",0
2337,,"I've been noticing a lot of movies I've been seeing lately, you can start them halfway through the movie and not miss a thing. PEARL HARBOR was the most guilty of this; you can start it about an hour and a half into the DVD and you wouldn't skip a beat. STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES goes further. If you have never seen this movie, start the DVD around the one hour, fifty minute mark. Trust me, you'll save yourself an hour and fifty minutes of boredom!",0
2338,5.0,"Attack of the Clones is a film of wasted potential.  Wooden acting by the poorly cast Hayden Christiansen doomed the first half of the film.  He made Anakin Skywalker boring and unmemorable, which is a shame, since his is the most important role in the six movie story arc.  As Anakin, he is nothing more than a frat boy leering at Natalie Portman's Senator Amidala, who chose a strange wardrobe for trying to discourage his attentions.",0
2339,10.0,The story paced well. The characters were better fleshed out and hardly any Jar Jar! This movie actually made me *really* want to see Episode III (Unlike Episode I). It's not so played down to kids. I was hooked from the beginning.,1

It started pretty good, with the explosion of Senator Amidala's Ship, and the chase through Coruscant, but I felt that the love story was too cheesy, and the scenes were copied from the original trilogy. Eg- The Obi-Wan / Jango Fett chase through the asteroid field (cloned from Empire strikes back), the clone fight (Return of the Jedi), and the Dooku/Anakin fight (Empire) when Vader cuts off Luke's right hand, Dooku cuts off Anakin's right arm. But there are some good points: The clone troops being ready for deployment was magnificent cgi, and the fact that Mace Windu lopped off the rather wooden Temuera Morrison's (Jango Fett) head, and when Yoda has finally been turned to cgi instead of the hardly moveable puppet. In total: a cheesy retread.",0

2351,1.0,"Certainly one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen.  By releasing the new installments of Star Wars, George Lucas somehow transformed himself into a complete hack.  This film relies on cheesy gimmicks and special effects rather than plot or character development and it's a shame that it bears the same name as the three episodes of Star Wars released decades ago.",0
2352,2.0,"After seeing this movie, I felt like I had watched a b-movie without the nudity.  The only reason people will watch a b-movie is to get to the naked girl...only in ""Clones"" the naked girl is the action scenes.  Which are truly amazing and worth the money...if you don't care about anything else. Only I would like to see a little more (story that is...not nudity).",0
2353,,"When you read the other reviewers of AOTC saying that George Lucas has redeemed himself after the much slated Phantom Menace, they are absolutely right. I was never one to negatovely criticise Episode 1 but I have to admit that it had lacked the essential Star Wars feel of the later episodes. This, I thought was down to the fact that I have aged 25 years since the original Star Wars and even though I attempted to view it with some of that childhood wonder, I felt perhaps that something was lacking. Any preconcpetions I may have had prior to seeing AOTC quickly disppeared though and I add my vote to the many who say that George Lucas has definitely returned to form. Attack of the Clones is, quite simply, stunning. Mainly due to the incredible effects but also due to the fact that Lucas seems to have returned to his grass roots. Perhaps, he tried too hard with Phantom, attempting to create something that would satisfy the fans' 25 year old hunger. An impossible task but here, he has settled back down into what he does best: simple storytelling. For a start, AOTC ""feels"" like proper Star Wars. In episodes 4,5 and 6, there were a number of story threads throughout each film which met to a conclusion at the end. Phantom Menace didn't seem to pull this off and followed the same characters from the film's start to its finish. In AOTC, there a number of different stories going on: Obi Wan's quest for the truth behind Senator Amidala's attempted assassination, the conspiracies happening behind the scenes in the Galactic Republic, the love story between Anakin and Padme, and Anakin's struggle with his own feelings and his role as a Jedi. This made it a much easier film to digest as each story was broken down into small pieces and alternated throughout before meeting for the conclusion. Hayden Christensen did a surprisingly good job of the maturing Anakin and although it took him a good while to achieve empathy to his character, once comfortable with his his role one could really get into the head of soon-to-be Darth Vadar. His feelings for his mother, he's uncontrollable love for Padme and his rebelliousness in the Jedi Order.  One of the most frightening scenes had him slaughtering Sandpeople, his rage uncontrolled and vicious. If Lucas maintains the passion of this character then we are in for one hell of an Episode 3 as we find out his fate. Ewen McGregor seems completely comfortable with his role as Obi Wan and looks and acts more like Alec Guinness with each passing scene. I also loved the many references to the later films, especially meeting a young Owen Lars and his girlfriend Beru. What a joy to see Luke Skywalker's future home, with Anakin sat in the refectory where we met a disillusioned Luke many years ago! And what about the young Boba Fett? Now we finally find out why he hates the Jedi so much. The young lad who plays him carries off the look of revenge so well as he realises his life-long vendetta. Watch out too towards the end of the film, a hologram of the Separatists' new weapon off-camera ... the Death Star. And did you ever want to see what Yoda really could do? Oh my god! His fight scene with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) was a genius piece of work. The audience roared with laughter too when after putting his light sabre away, he hobbled away as normal on his walking stick! The effects are quite simply stunning. Lucas, comfortable with his art has created a universe of unparalelled beauty. We get to see more of Coruscant (watch out for the deliberate reference to Blade Runner), Naboo, Tattooine and new worlds such as Kamino and Geonosis. One of the most stunning scenes is the quite simply amazing chase sequence through the asteroids of Geonosis. Remember how impressed you were with Han Solo guiding the Millennium Falcon through asteroids after its flight from Hoth? You ain't seen nothing yet! And I was overjoyed to see one of my favourite Star Wars vehicles, The Slave I, doing its stuff. The final battle sequence too, with a million Clone Troopers fighting battle droids is perhaps one of the greatest sequences ever filmed. Attack of the Clones from my perspective as a Star Wars fan, more than excceeded my expectations and I know that I need to see it at least twice more. This is REAL Star Wars, overdosed on steriods and the best two and half hours I have spent this year. If you're a fellow fan, you'll love it and I would even say that to those who claim Empire is the best of the lot ... there's a new guy in town. Keep up the good work George and bring us an Episode 3 that you have set up so well with this installment. 10/10",1
2354,8.0,"This was much better than Episode I.  Jar Jar lives but with only a bit part.  The jokes are corny but that is OK too.  The romance between Amidala and Skywalker might be a little confusing since they don't seem to fall in love too quickly.  Hayden Christensen plays the tortured young Jedi well. This movie is much darker than Episode I and its tone and even plot bring to mind Empire Strikes Back.  Overall, a good movie and a good addition to the Star Wars legacy.  I was not disappointed.",1

I know that a lot of people were disappointed in The Phantom Menace, I was NOT one of them. But this movie is far superior. The story was better, the film was set at a faster pace and the action was spectacular. A visual masterpiece. It is indeed, as Mr. Lucas said, a darker movie than the last. But it is to be expected in the grand scheme of the Star Wars story. The first battle of the Clone Wars between the Jedi and the Republic is akin Gladiator meets..well...meets Star Wars! The final duel sequence between Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Yoda is breathtaking. To see the little Jedi Master movie around so swiftly and display his prowess lets the viewer know exactly why he is the Ultimate Jedi Master...he steals the movie.",1

2359,7.0,"Attack of the Clones is a little better than The Phantom Menace, but still does not even come close to the original trilogy.  Even Return of the Jedi was better overall.  I've been a huge fan of the originals for years.  I was definitely a Star Wars fanboy up until the release of the disappointing Episode I.  My expectations had been set so high and I just felt so let down.  The initial reviews of Episode II gave me a little bit of hope, but when the majors gave it mixed reviews I went into it with lower expectations.  And I still feel disappointed with this one.  Don't listen to the fanboys who like to flame the negative reviews.  This film deserves every one of them.  It's not a bad film at all but it's nothing great. The acting is mostly stale and the dialog is mostly weak.  The effects are fantastic but they seem overused.  This is most definitely an animated film starring humans.  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* - - The last hour of the film is full of waaay to many different droids and forms of technology that does nothing but put the older sequel trilogy to shame as far as effects go. Most people agree that Yoda's role in the end is the best part of the film. But I think the Yoda character was dumbed down in Attack of the Clones compared to what we see of him in the original trilogy.  And not even the end of the film redeems his role in my opinion.  Plus, that particular scene is just too short.  My main gripe with this film is that it doesn't explain much of anything!  It does very little to move the story along.  Episode III has A LOT to explain...  There are things I enjoyed about this one.  I actually liked the humor with R2-D2 and C-3PO. I really enjoyed the end of the tatooine scene with Anakin.  It was very powerful.  I have yet to see this film digitally projected, but that won't change anything I've said about it.  I saw it on film.  The film was a little bit dark, but it still looked like film to me.  I look forward to the next episode and hope that George Lucas truly redeems himself.",1

Sorry to say, but times have changed since then.  George Lucas isn't an idiot...he knows exactly what he's doing, and he's making movies for today's generation.  Episode I was childish, because it was made for mostly children.  Episode II is a little more mature, because those kids are a little more mature now.  And so on.",1
2378,2.0,"3D animation doesn't do it for me any more, and that is all Episode II was, visually beautiful, but what about the story? The movie was 1 hour longer than what it should of been. I think it comes down to bad directing, George Lucas should stick to writing the story and directing ILM, but he should let someone else direct, like he did in his previous movies. He is not timing his scenes properly, they ar way too long, he is definitely not directing well his actors, but I guess that it's not easy acting in front of a blue screen. What happened to the magic, where are the interesting characters, the great dialogs. The characters are so dull, not even Samuel L.Jackson could put energy to his character.

2382,,"There were a number of shockingly bad aspects of this film, but they were saved by one glorious scene.... Bad points - Obi wan's constant "" I think that the boy will be the death of me""(nudge nudge, wink wink). Ewan thinks he's Alec Guinness. Samuel L jackson doesn't quote the bible. Hilariously bad dialogue ""you've grown too... more beautiful I mean"". Jar Jar still in it (please let him have a horrible death in the next one George). Too much special effects - build a set, you lazy b*****ds. Hayden ""puberty is really affecting my acting"" Christansen.",0

2384,6.0,"The special effects were incredible- Yoda is no longer a puppet but a computer generated character.  There were too many such characters for my tastes.  In addition to Yoda, Jar Jar Binks makes another appearance, this time as a minor character, and at least two other characters with some importance to the plot were CGI.",0

2389,8.0,"As hard as it is to impress today's sophisticated, seen-it-all before audience, Attack of the Clones does just that. While critics will be quick to point out awkward dialog and an unrealistic romance, no one can deny the numerous elements that make this is one of the finest motion pictures of all time: incredible special effects, epic scale battles, hundreds of lightsaber-thrashing jedi, amazing sound effects, intense emotional performances from Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman's skin-tight outfit, Yoda kicking serious fanny, hacked off limbs, etc. Not to mention composer John Williams' finest work he has ever done. Thanks George for giving the fans what they wanted.",1

2397,5.0,"The movie itself was very good; the special effects were pretty seamless; it had the look and feel of all the other Star Wars movies.  The only exception was the plot was like. no, the plot was The Empire Strikes Back, in a jumbled order:  Large scale army scene on flat landscape with armored walkers,  restrained to be later killed by local monster, starfighter chase scene through an asteroid field, landing on a large object mid starfighter fight to hide from radar, hi jinks with a droid's head, leading lady falling for questionable good guy, bounty hunter proving that he is the coolest thing in the galaxy. The saving grace I was looking for, the lightsaber battle, was not at tall what I hoped, as Christopher Lee, Count Dooku, is not Ray Park. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan, I love the series, but I was looking for more.  I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect better.",0
2398,7.0,"Well, this film can be reviewed as two seperate movies, really. One is a visual treat on a level never before seen in the cinema. The other is a character play that clunks along like cinematic artereosclerosis.",1
2399,10.0,"As much as I defended Episode I, allot of elements of that film let me down. Episode II was fantastic. George Lucas realized with Episode I that he's no screenwriter, so he brought help and it worked out for the best. This film has some incredible action sequences, the FX are incredible. Each film makes me respect ILM a bit more. But what really made the film shine for me was the drama. I usually don't like love stories, especially ones involving teenagers (Titanic), but I have to say that I was impressed with this. Natalie Portman is certainly not an Oscar winner, but she has improved 10 fold since Phantom Menace. Hayden is amazing, he'll garner an Oscar in the next 5 years for sure. The jokes were mature and reminded me of Han Solo's brand of humor. (""Oh not good!""), even Jar Jar was great in this film. The film has that sense of adventure that I loved in Empire (Episode 5 in the series). The characters are rich and three-dimensional like the OT characters, well except for some of the politicians, but I believe that is by design. I've always loved the Jedi, they are my personal heroes in the SW Universe, and it was nice to really see them in action and in practice. We really got a glimpse of what life is like in the SW universe. None of the other films ever did that. Anakin's scene with his mother was an Oscar-calibre performance.",1
2400,1.0,What a waste of film.  No wonder the theatre was almost empty.,0
2401,10.0,"To quote one of my favorite video game squirrels: ""Oh my giddy aunt...."" In my opinion, Episode II had it a little easier than Episode I did. Wheras Episode I was having to live up to the untouchable classic 3, Episode II merely had to rise above the fetid steaming pile that was Episode I.  But by no means is this an inferior movie.  EVERY SINGLE ASPECT is bettered by Episode II.  Acting, Special Effects, Plot....the list is long.  But one of the biggest differences in this movie (in my opinion) is that this movie seems a little more...""human"" if you will.  No stiff acting, or impassive emotions- this is a movie ABOUT emotions.  The classic Star Wars humor also makes a much deserved inclusion as well.  George Lucas has been forgiven. Also, on a side note:  Rumor has it that Samuel L Jackson has BMF engraved on his lightsaber.  After seeing this movie, I think most will agree with me when I say: Yoda should have the BMF engraved on his lightsaber.  Never before have I witnessed a scene in a movie with a bigger mix of emotions- fond nostalgia, absurd hilarity, and complete reverence for the arse-kicking skills of Master Yoda.  Go see it.",1
2402,6.0,"The movie, finally here, delivers.  Yes it is over 2 hours long, but in the end we all want it to be that long don't we?  With another 3 years to wait for the final installment, we need all the Star Wars screen time that we can get.  All the Star Wars films are around 2 hours long, so why would this one be any different?",1

Some people still are naysayers (mostly due to the Phantom Menace), but you have to love a movie in which Yoda kicks some serious ass and Jar Jar Binks brings about the destruction of the universe (you'll just have to go and see).  This movie was incredible.  Those who complain about the bad acting, wooden dialogue, and lack of story apparently haven't seen the original trilogy, which in itself is incredible.  All in all, a fantastic movie.",1
2405,9.0,"I'm not a big fan of Star Wars Series but I've seen all the episodes. For me, Episode II is much better than Episode I. The battle with Yoda is mazing! In one word, this movie is greatest!!! Thank you George...",1
2406,7.0,"I'm regretting my cynicism a little - it was better than I expected. The effects were of course very nice, but this time, they were used for considerably better effect - Lucas' formidable skill with visuals has obviously returned. My favorite scene, cinematography-wise, was definitely the chase scene at the beginning. The digital effects were stunning, and absolutely necessary for a scene like this - the number of speeders, buildings, and people in the scene couldn't have been achieved without CGI. This time, it seems that Lucas' cinematic vision hasn't been outpaced by the power of his computers. I also very much liked the visuals in the scenes on the water planet (can't think of the name). They impressed me a great deal.",1
2407,,"It seems nowadays that nobody who even considers themselves even the smallest of Star Wars fans can resist bashing Episode One. Lucas has lost his touch, too much talking, no action, Jar Jar is a pain. Well, Episode II has proved all naysayers wrong (mostly).",0

2409,3.0,"Personally this film, in complete honesty, bored the fun-lovin' crap out of me.",0
2410,9.0,"I have grown up on Star Wars, and usually look forward to each new installment with unrealistic excitement.  This time around I was really just hoping for an entertaining ride.  AOTC is undoubtedly much more than this. I must say that I absolutely loved it!  The acting is a bit flat the directing is a little off, and it is absolutely about as much fun as you can have in a theater.  Just what should be expected of Star Wars movies.  Lucas shows no limitations in imagination, and aims to please, not only the average viewer but especially the fan of the saga . . . something he miserably failed to do with E1.  The medichlorian count is up in this one!",0
2411,1.0,I think it was the worst movie of 2002. I want my money back. I think that it was over hyped and that the script was BAD. I feel that I was cheated out of 2 hours and 25 min..,0
2412,10.0,"Wonderful and Awesome, are mere words to describe Attack of The Clones. Lucas did a great job of putting us on the edge of our seats and an equally good job of keeping us in suspense. The growth of young Anikin was explained very well, and his gradual love affair with Padime fit in nicely, among the growing conflict between good and evil. Meeting several new characters and seeing some old favorites in actual battle was terrific. This installment of Star Wars definitely sits well with the original trilogy.",1
2413,,"Um, it was ok.  For some reason, the Anakin/Padme romance didn't click for me.  And let's face it, that's what this movie really turns on.  And if you don't buy that, the rest is hard to swallow.  What in the world does she see in him?  She: a young but experienced Senator, and ruler of a planet.  He: an immature, mixed-up, narcissistic, teenage Jedi wannabe.  He almost made me long for the kid in the first movie!  It isn't until after he slaughters the sand people camp that she pledges her love.  No wonder Leia likes scoundrels...she gets it from Mom!  And the scene where Anakin's mother dies...I almost laughed it was so cliched.  It's a good thing it wasn't a wide shot, or I'd half-expected her feet to fly up at the moment of truth (a la Shemp of the 3 Stooges).",0
2414,,"Like many movie viewers, I saw the original Star Wars as a child. So great was its effect on me, I don't remember it so much as a movie as something that happened to me as a kid. As such, my feelings about the recent prequel trilogy are prone to be colored by my having placed the first trilogy on a rather inaccessible pedestal.",1
2415,10.0,"Let me start off by saying, do NOT listen to the wind bags that are bent to ruin this movie. It was great. I can't see why anyone could not like this movie. There is action and Natalie Portman for the guys; Hayden Christensen and love for the girls; Star Wars itself for the kids; Nostalgia for the fans; and a great plot for the intellectuals. Theoretically, this is the perfect movie. Go see it in the theaters and help fight the battle between Spiderman.",1
2416,7.0,"There was no problem with the story. Obi-wan is finding bounty hunter, anakin is looking for his mother is excellent. (except that part in naboo. Even i can't handle that.)",0
2417,1.0,"Attack of the Clones was one heck of a movie.  I'd put it up there with the likes of ""Empire"" and ""A New Hope.""  I went into the movie theater with very, very low expectations.  Folks, this movie plays out just like ""Empire,"" and thats a good thing.  The love story isn't as flawed as everybody says, it's kind of like Han & Leia's fling in ""Empire,"" but ends in a different fashion.",0
2418,5.0,"Star Wars Episode II:  Attack of the Clones, in my opinion, flatlined in its first thirty minutes.  George Lucas has failed miserably in capturing the charm, wit, fun and excitement of the previous Star Wars films, especially the original trilogy.  The acting was generally wooden throughout and the Skywalker/Amidala romance has to the sappiest most pathetic romance I have ever seen.  If anything it is the non-humans that did the best acting - *SPOILER* I did enjoy the interaction between C3P0 and R2D2 near the end of movie, and Yoda's (again not a human) fight and ""use of the force"" with a light sabre was also entertaining, the films only redeeming features.",0

2420,6.0,SPOILERS ALERT,0
2421,4.0,my rating is 4.0 / 10. new star wars stinks. 2 is better than 1 at the expense of interesting character development. 3 is not cool. they're stupid. I could care less about these movies. have you heard about the new clone wars cg show? me neither. the laser is off target. I have a funny feeling about this movie. don't spend your money on this movie. digital effects have made the acting and reactions completely stale and worse than imaginable. they are phoning it in. these movies are difficult to watch. I don't believe these are the same people we saw the first trilogy. its shameful that he thought this was acceptable. the collectors editions will transform it further into decomposed trash with extra seepage. I am reminded of Point of No Return.,0
2422,10.0,"First off, let me say how frustrated I have become from reading the mainstream and many of the other reviews.  They have been harping how Lucas writes corny or flat out bad dialogue.  Or how AOTC is nothing but cheap eye candy. (eye candy maybe, cheap no)  All I'm trying to say is that all of his films have that corny dialogue, its entertaining, it is a signature of being a Star Wars movie and it's something we love about it.  As for people nit picking the CG, well all I can say is that is absolutely absurd.",0
2423,,"If you are a Star Wars fan (like me), you will love this movie. If you aren't you will love it anyway, but on a different level. George Lucas has given just about everyone a light-sabre, and there are some terrific battles, far better then anything in the other Star Wars movies. You see an entire army of Jedis, running forward and smashing aside laser blasts with their light sabres, and then crashing into an army of droids, which is truly satisfying, and the young Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan fighting back to back, which is a bit ironic really, considering what will happen in the later movies. Anyway, the battles are brilliant, and Yoda gives everyone a big surprise by turning up and showing us all just why he is the Jedi master. Unfortunately, the acting was pretty rubbish: Natalie Portman, who plays Amidala was completely flat, and Anakin Skywalker just couldn't pull off the bits when he wasn't angry. Samuel L Jackson was a bit of a disappointment too; he is an excellent actor, but was held back by the script. However, Ewan Mcgregor was excellent as Obi-Wan, and acted the part really well. No worries though, as the acting was never Star Wars' strong point, and the battles truly make up for it. There were also lots of references to the later movies: Anakin has his arm chopped off, we are shown how the Bounty Hunter Boba Fett came to be, and there is a brilliant line, when Obi-Wan says to Anakin, ""I have a feeling you will be the death of me."" So anyway, if you have not seen this movie, go and see it, as it is pretty damn good. Well done George Lucas, I can't wait for the next one!",1
2424,,"I remember refusing to see Star Wars when it was first released because it was so hyped up.  Fortunately I came to my senses and my brother persuaded me to go see it.  I adored it! and can remember going to bed that night and singing the theme tune whilst jumping over all the furniture in my room. Read the books to the second and third and saw the films on tv.  Both quite good, but for me didn't nearly approach the excitement I felt watching the first.",1

The action scenes are exciting, the jokes are funny and the romantic scenes are nice.  It is about time we had a good romance in a ""Star Wars"" movie.  Yes, Han and Leia fell in love in ""ESB"" and ""ROTJ"" but we don't get the details of it like we do here. Yes, I will admit that ""Episode II"" could have been better in some ways, but it is GOOD ENOUGH and that is all that mattered to me.  Hurrah for ""Star Wars!""",1

The action depicted buy the Jedi Masters and their apprentices, i.e. Anakin Skywalker, are spectacular.  Yoda kicks major a!@ against Count Dooku!!!  Mace Windu show what the force can do in dire circumstances and theri are plenty of great Jedi to try to save the galaxy from the Dark Side.  Definitely a must see!!! I plan on going again to take in everything that the long movie has to include in this awesome series. Thank you George Lucas!!!!",1

Good acting,plot was ""thick"" enough,romance scenes weren't too drab & dreary(like most ""love"" scenes in movies try to be).Substainable action sequences through most of the movie.Some of the scenes stretched a little much for no apparent reason,but to be honest with you,by the end of the movie you really don't care!Enjoy this one,we don't get this quality of movie very often.",1
