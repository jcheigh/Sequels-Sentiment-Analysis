1,10.0,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) is a classic phenomenal arguably the best sci-fi film in trilogy away, the one that started all and arguably changed the face of cinema forever. I love this film is actually my number 1 favorite film in the franchise and it is George Lucas masterpiece - the man who make this film happening. He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will. This was the first film in the trilogy that I have saw as a kid and that I remember. Star Wars are starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.",1
2,10.0,"Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones.",1
3,10.0,"I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.",1
4,9.0,"Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.",1
5,10.0,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.",0

7,,"I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.",1
8,10.0,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.",0
9,10.0,This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that will be loved forever. The special affects are so good for 1977 and the soundtrack for this movie is amazing.,1
10,10.0,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.",1
11,10.0,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.",1
12,10.0,The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.,1
13,9.0,"When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I'd never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren't cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn't been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today's CGI.",1
14,10.0,"Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?",1
15,10.0,"This movie when I first saw it as a kid absolutely amazed me and put me into a world where I wished I could be! The story is absolutely genius, the characters are amazing! Everything about this movie is amazing! George Lucas made an absolute masterpiece of a film!!!!! May The Force Be With You!",1
16,10.0,"This is not a review of the first ( and best ) 'Star Wars' movie. I take it, fellow I.M.D.B. users, that you are already familiar with the plot, characters and production history, and how its success changed the face of cinema overnight. So rather than rehash all the known facts, I want instead to recount a personal memory.",1
17,10.0,"Star Wars seems to lack the sense of importance that all of the sequels and prequels had. This one just seeks to entertain, and there's nothing wrong with that! Star Wars is one of those miracle movies (a term borrowed from Leonard Maltin) where everything went wrong but it all came together in the end, like Jaws and The Wizard of Oz. The movie was plagued by budget problems, and Lucas was so behind schedule he suffered a few panic attacks, which is probably why he did not direct the sequels. ",0
18,10.0,"Star Wars (A New Hope) is a near perfect sci-fi adventure that's incredibly bold, original and extremely entertaining. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels and Carrie Fisher all give incredible performances. James Earl Jones is fantastic as Darth Vader, one of the best villains of all time. Alec Guinness gives a great supporting performance. The visual effects are stunning and still look really good. It's extremely well paced and genuinely thrilling throughout with excellent action sequences and space battles. The music by John Williams is perfect as well as George Lucas's direction as the film is beautifully filmed.",1
19,10.0,"This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...",1
20,9.0,"Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.",1
21,10.0,The best Star Wars movie is recommended for anyone who wants to start watching the Star Wars series to start this movie.,1
22,6.0,"""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn't too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing's character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.",0
23,10.0,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.",1
24,10.0,"what can you say about his movie.it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged,and this was 1977.i'm talking about the visual effects,which were nothing less than astounding.it still stands up well to any movie in that regard.remember,they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then,so they relied on miniatures.when you add to that,a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain(not to mention,the colourful cast of characters)and you have box office gold.sure,the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times,but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film.Besides,the film was marketed at 12 year olds,so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue.The original ""Star Wars"" or as it is subtitled ""a New Hope,was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre. Obviously 10/10",0

27,7.0,"When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era. ",0
28,10.0,"I couldn't let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it's not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single 'Whoa' with each new scene and concept that hadn't been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn't it? ",1
29,10.0,"During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?",1
30,,"I was never a ""Star Wars"" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a ""Star Trek"" guy growing up either (""Doctor Who"" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or ""Deep Space 9"", ""The Wrath of Khan"", and ""The Undiscovered Country"" over any ""Star Wars"" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" again, having been inspired by catching half of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.",1
31,10.0,There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).,1
32,9.0,"Director/Writer George Lucas's immensely Influential Film was itself Influenced by a Myriad of Classic Stories, Films, and Mythology.",0
33,10.0,"A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.",1
34,9.0,"Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.",1
35,9.0,"This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.",1
36,9.0,"The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.",1
37,9.0,"In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.",0
38,8.0,"This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.",1
39,10.0,"George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.",1
40,9.0,"Star Wars begins not with opening credits, as the guild would enforce in those days, but with a scrawl that has become legendary. Back then, it was a few lines of yellow text scrolling across a lengthy screen that would be photographed on the backdrop of an infinite star- field, losing itself in a vanishing point far, far away. A modest effect, yet those words instantly paint a picture so incredibly vivid that it would kick-start a hugely popular and successful franchise. And it is nothing without its iconic fanfare by John Williams. Take a listen to Holst's Mars movement and see how Williams transforms all the heroism, all the grandiosity and glory into one of the most recognisable themes of all time. And then we pan down and observe a little ship being pursued by a gigantic one, something so immediately identifiable, and we already are entranced. ",0
41,10.0,"Who would have thought that an experimental director would have had to resurrect classic hero story telling? Well, that's where they were in the 70s. And Lucas did it with such perfection. He did his research and he cared. And most importantly he was trusted to make the movie that he wanted.",0
42,9.0,"A long time ago in a galaxy far far away a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker encounters two eccentric droids, gets attacked by sand people and is then saved by an old wizard by the name of Ben Kenobi. After a brief chat the farm boy discovers that Ben and Luke's father used to protect the universe as Jedi Knights until his father was killed by the evil Darth Vader. After his aunt and uncle are killed Luke realises his destiny has been chosen for him and he and Ben are going to have to take on the empire, and from this point movie history will never be the same again.",1
43,10.0,There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.,0
44,10.0,"Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.",1
45,7.0,"Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.",1
46,9.0,"A New Hope will forever go down in history as the start of one of the greatest cinematic adventures of all time.

47,10.0,"One word can describe Star Wars...Perfection with a capital P! Star Wars is so perfectly molded together filled with pieces all so crucial yet all so wonderful,John William's A+++ score, or James Earl Jones' powerful voice.Really George Lucas' picture should be put next to the word Lucky in the dictionary.He had such a bizarre concept,and people had doubts.I mean if he was pitching Star Wars to me I would too.Yet this is the Little Movie that Could so to say.The acting is A+,my personal favorite performance is Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi.People would argue about Geogre Lucas not being a great director after the infamous Prequels,that's a load of B.S.Lucas pours his imagination on the screen and the audience is captivated.We have to give a standing ovation to ILM which started in the 70's with Star Wars.The movie is still amazing to look at nearly 30 years later and with C.G.I in the movie making mix.The plot sounds bizarre on paper but it works wonders on screen and flows quickly,I don't believe I have ever checked my watch while watching Star Wars.I have to applaud Mr.Lucas,Star Wars has fueled the imaginations of many and will continue to fuel generations to come.One moment can describe the impact of the whole Star Wars experience/impact for me,the scene where Luke looks into the setting suns accompanied by William's brilliant score.It's a very moving scene.I really think it tells you to look out for more in your life to become something so to say.Star Wars can only be surpassed by it's sequel Empire Strikes Back but looking back at both I think they are even.Empire Stikes Back and Star Wars are in my opinion the best movies ever made",1
48,9.0,"In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.",1
49,10.0,"Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! ",1
50,,In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recall those times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  this decade and the next.,1

53,8.0,George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.,1
54,7.0,"After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.",1
55,9.0,"It's what movies are all about, really - sitting in a seat that's already been worn in by a thousand other tushes, crunching as much popcorn under your feet as you crunch in your mouth by handfuls, sipping a soda that's three times as big as you would ever really need... and then there's this very quiet little opening line written on the screen, like a new way of saying ""once upon a time..."" and you know the fairy tale is beginning, but before you can even get ready to get interested, that fateful, stirring, uplifting and scary chord throws you deep into your seat, in time with a logo that's too big for the screen... and the rest is just a ride. That's what movies are all about and that's what Star Wars gave us.",0
56,9.0,"This film came along at just the right time for me.Upon it's initial release in 1977,I was 12 years old,which is the perfect age to see something this eye opening and different.I remember sitting and watching with just as much awe and amazement as perhaps 12 year olds from past generations seeing their first cowboy movie.I remember the thrills as though I saw it fresh yesterday.Upon seeing it again recently for the first time in many years,now well into my adulthood,I find,unfortunately,that the thrill that came with my first viewing did not come with me across the years.Despite this fact,I still saw a great film,one worthy of any home library.It's suspenseful,thrilling,and contains a great story line and interesting characters that we care about.It was great looking back on Harrison Ford when his hair wasn't quite so gray,Mark Hamill,whom we all thought would go on to be a great film star,though he has done little beyond this trilogy,Carrie Fisher, and,at least in voice,James Earl Jones(Darth Vader).Though the initial childhood thrill is gone,this is still a great film.",1
57,,"I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. ",0
58,10.0,"George Lucas spent four years developing and working on the galactic fantasy Star Wars. This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.",1

Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards.

69,8.0,"The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed ""Hidden Fortress,"" with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from ""Yojimbo."" As a result, ""Star Wars"" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in ""Star Wars"" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in ""Star Wars""). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, ""Star Wars"" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in ""Space: 1999"" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. ""Star Wars"" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard ""Dirty Harry"" is a detective story & ""Last Tango in Paris"" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, ""Star Wars"" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in ""Star Wars"" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (""This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!"" ""This bickering is pointless!"" ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of ""Star Trek"" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to ""Star Wars"" than that the ""Star Trek"" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of ""Star Wars,"" turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it ""Star Wars"" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. ""Star Wars"" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.",1

Even the dance scene with the Ewoks at the end of Return Of The Jedi.",1
76,10.0,"Truly a landmark film. When it came out, there had never been anything like it before, and it truly caused quite a stir. I would contend that it is not as good as its sequel, Empire Strikes Back; but it is still a great movie. There is humor, action, and some heartfelt moments. It is also our introduction to some great characters that people will never forget - Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi...and of course everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. Alec Guinness really is outstanding in this movie. His role as Luke's first mentor is understated and believable...his somewhat tired attitude in retrospect seems very understandable after watching the prequels - after all he's been through, it is very believable when he tells Luke, ""I'm getting to old for this sort of thing."" The visual effects are not only groundbreaking, but they still hold up very well even in this CGI-effects laden era. I would contend that ILM's use of modeling and lighting in the old films actually lends a more believable look to the action scenes than the prequels' use of video-game style battles and sensory overload. There is great chemistry between the actor's - and while Luke is a bit annoying, the back and forth of Han and Chewbacca, and C-3PO and R2-D2, as well as Leia's chemistry with Han and Luke, make this movie extremely entertaining on an emotional level - it also makes you care about the characters. Let us compare the lightsaber duel of this movie with that from Phantom Menace. Although the acrobatics and sheer fury of the duel just are not there in A New Hope, we actually feel something when Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down. Conversely, when Qui-Gon Jinn is slain, there is not the same (if any) feeling after it is done. Well, I'm rambling now. But this movie has it all. Space battles, lightsaber duels (a la Samurai flicks), chase sequences, thinly veiled references to the Western genre in the Canteen on Tatooine.

80,10.0,"Throughout the history of movies, maybe no other series has had a bigger impact on popular culture than Star Wars. The entire franchise is talked about more and praised more than I can even start to discuss. Before our current predicament (depending on how you look at it) with the franchise and George's decisions to ""remaster"" the movies and essentially downgrade them, there was the original film made back in the 70s. I'm not going to talk about any of the expanded universe things that Star Wars has in its lore because I just want to focus on this first movie for now. As expected, many people consider this one the best of all, although some might argue episode V is slightly better. I'm not going to debate any of that, but I will say that before this movie was released, things of its caliber were hardly dreamed of. Star Wars has such an unimaginable wealth of content to explore and talk about that it is almost as deep as our real universe, and it expands with each new movie that comes out. Of course, with such a huge amount of subjects to delve into, George Lucas had to start somewhere, and he chose to do something not many other movie makers would do. Star wars does obviously have a starting point, but not where you would expect it to be. The movie begins with a spaceship that belongs to a so called ""rebel alliance"" being closely pursued by a large class of spacegoing warship known as a star destroyer. Bristling with laser cannons and tractor beams, the star destroyer is able to give most rebel ships a run for their money. In this case, the rebel ship (called the Tantive IV) is trying to outrun the much more formidable Imperial one, presumably because it has important cargo. However, the rebel ship takes considerable damage and comes to a halt. The Rebel ship is pulled underneath the Imperial one, allowing the enemy to board it. Led by the ruthless Darth Vader, Rebel soldiers onboard are effortlessly swept aside. Meanwhile, Princess Leia Organa (one of the Rebel leaders) hides the aforementioned important secret cargo inside a droid named R2-D2. The cargo is very crucial to the story because it is the schematics to the Death Star, a gargantuan Imperial space station armed with a laser strong enough to annihilate an entire planet. After taking Leia hostage, Vader frantically tries to search the Rebel ship for the schematics, but R2 uses an escape pod to blast onto the desert planet of Tatooine with a protocol droid named C-3PO. The plans are out of Imperial hands (for now.) On the desert planet, R2 and C-3PO are captured by roaming travelers called Jawas who wear brown robes and have two yellow dots for eyes with no visible faces. The jawas offer to sell the droids to Owen Lars. Luke Skywalker, his nephew, lives with him. After the droids are in their possession, Luke comes across a holographic recording of Leia that says someone named ""Obi-Wan"" must help her. Luke later runs into Obi-Wan in the desert, who now lives in exile and is known as Ben Kenobi. Ben used to be a very powerful warrior who is able to use a magical presence called ""the Force"" to manipulate people and his surroundings. Not everyone can use it, and it takes a very long time to get good at. He tells Luke the warrior group he was a part of is called the Jedi Order, and Jedi use a special type of close-quarters weapon that is basically a beam of light projected from a metal hilt. These ""lightsabers"" are incredibly powerful and valuable weapons, and Luke obtains one from Obi-Wan. It apparently belonged to Luke's father, who was killed by Vader a long time ago. Later on, Luke and Obi-Wan must go to a cantina in the town of Mos Eisley to search for a spaceship that will enable them to take the death star plans to Leia's home planet. They come across Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his co-pilot Chewbacca. Together, they fly the Millennium Falcon; a fairly outmoded and obsolete spacecraft that isn't meant for fighting but can be useful in skilled hands. After taking off in the ship, they set out for Leia's homeworld, Alderaan, but not before Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) uses the Death Star's enormous superlaser to blow the planet to bits. Onboard the Falcon, the crew is now having second thoughts about going to Alderaan, and notice it isn't even there. They fly towards some object that resembles a moon, but upon getting closer, it's revealed to be the death star. The ship is powerless to fly away and the Death Star pulls them towards it with a tractor beam. Luke, Solo, and the others disguise themselves as Vader's soldiers (stormtroopers) and search the enormous Death Star for Princess Leia. Upon finding her, they attempt to escape, but find out that Kenobi has come face to face with Vader. His lightsaber battle with him buys the rest of the Rebels time to escape, but Vader kills Kenobi after he willingly deactivates his lightsaber. Regardless, the plans for the Death Star are secure which allows the Rebels to launch a huge assault on the space station with starfighters, one of them being piloted by Luke. The Death Star plans illustrate that the only way to destroy it is to use a proton torpedo to destroy its main reactor, causing a fatal chain reaction. In an attempt to stop Luke from achieving his goal, Vader chases him in his own starfighter, flanked by two TIE fighters. Luke only needs to hold out for a few more seconds to launch the torpedo, but Vader closes in on him fast. Right when all seems lost, Solo appears from out of nowhere in the Millennium Falcon and blasts Vader's ship off Luke's tail. Vader survives, but Luke is cleared to fire. The torpedo goes right down the reactor port and initiates the chain reaction process, which culminates in the entire Death Star exploding. The Rebel base on the nearby planet is spared a horrible demise, and the Rebels are saved. I don't think I need to say this, but I will anyway. This movie is awesome. The visuals, sound effects, special effects, sheer size of the locations, etc. Is still going to amaze people almost 50 years later, and I think everyone can agree the sound of a lightsaber is what makes Star Wars Star Wars. It deserves recognition both for what it is and for what it started. Even in this one movie alone, there is a huge amount of content and lore, but not much backstory. The first Star Wars movie begins in the middle of a galactic war, which makes the audience feel there's a lot of backstory that you didn't get to see. Thanks to the newer movies, we now know the things that came many years before (and after) the events of this one. It might seem obvious, but the characters are all great too. Luke is the classic hero archetype who has a great deal of responsibility on his shoulders, and with the threat of the Death Star looming, it makes the tension feel more dramatic. Although he doesn't appear much, Tarkin is one of the most disturbing characters because of his ability to kill millions at the push of a button and feel no remorse. Han Solo is not a hero in the traditional sense, but he cares about his crewmembers and would do anything to ensure their safety. Leia, while basically a damsel in distress for much of the movie, still displays a huge amount of defiance in the face of Vader's evil empire. Obi-Wan serves as the physically old master of the ways of the Force, and despite his aged appearance, he is very skilled and mentally powerful. Vader is probably the hardest to categorize because he is obviously the main bad guy, but the audience will still most likely pity him because of his dark past and insecurities. Obi-Wan says he used to be allies with him, but Vader became too interested in the dark side of the Force and lost his way. To summarize, I shouldn't have to state the obvious, but you really should watch this movie at least once. It is a mind-bendingly good start to one of the best movie series in history.",0

I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a ""Star Wars"" fanatic.

It was a film quite like nothing anyone had seen before a truly visual and cinematic achievement. The story begins on Chapter IV and takes us on an action packed journey filled with aliens, intrigue and adventure. The success of Star Wars is ultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of course to the extremely well orchestrated cast. I think George Lucas was riding high with his previous film success 'American Graffiti, but this is far removed from Star Wars, no similarities at all. I was simply captivated the first time I saw this film in the cinema's back in '77 and still amalthough the big screen does give it more of an impact. Everything about Star Wars will definitely appeal to a vast audience from children to adults alike.it's a 'must see film' in my opinion.

They are not choreographed very well and look just like a couple of old dudes trying to punch each other with sticks. It's done so much better in the prequels, less so in the new movies. The lightsabers feel like a traditional novelty more than like a weapon feared by the galaxy. What the movie does very well are its twists and pacing.

But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of ""Star Wars"" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch.

Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels.

It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz.

93,10.0,"I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.",1

It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including ""The Searchers."" Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement.

The enormous popularity of this film opened the floodgates for copious movies about space battle in the ensuing years ahead!!

Harrison Ford is one of the all time box office legends in Hollywood, his big break was with the movie ""Star Wars"",,, Later, of course, he captivated millions with his stellar performance in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""!! Movies like ""Star Wars"" do not come along very often, when they do, they set a precedent in the film industry!! I found the film ""Star Wars"" to be way ahead of it's time with regard to the optical gimmickry that they so superbly effectuated!! The music to ""Star Wars"" is classic in it's charismatic demeanor, and, by and large, it is understandable that the most prominent critics in the film industry rank ""Star Wars"" as one of the greatest movies ever made!! ""Star Wars"" is always chosen as one of the top twenty films in the American movie market by the esoteric and discriminating critics of AFI!!

105,10.0,"This has been by far the greatest movie of all time. The special effects are very fantastic especially when the movie was made before I was even born, even Return of the Jedi was made 7 years before I was born, or should I say it was completed 7 years before I was born. It's like George Lucas who's the Director for all the Star Wars movies including Episode III- Revenge of the Sith, it's like he went back in time a long time ago and he traveled to a galaxy far, far away. I must say George Lucas, I am very impressed. This probably did all happen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. I just can't believe it, I mean how did he do it, this film is just ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. George Lucas can make any kind of movie he wants. He can even make a movie about what happens far before Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace and he can even make a movie about what happens far after Star Wars Episode VI- Return of the Jedi. So George Lucas I have been a huge fan of Star Wars since I saw Episode IV when I was 5 and I'll be honest, I didn't really understand the storyline because I was only 5. But I was just amazed on the Special Effects, it was incredible for it's time, 1977. And when I turned 7 my mother bought the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition and it was even better with all new Advanced Digital Technology and I started to understand the storyline a lot better. And when I turned 14 I bought the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD and it got much better with one of the best pictures I have ever seen in a movie. But the Number 1 thing I hated about the DVD was that in Return of the Jedi at the very end of the movie you see the ghosts of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and Anakin Skywalker. I hated the fact that in the DVD you replaced Anakin Skywalker's ghost with the Anakin Skywalker from Episode II and Episode III. You shouldn't have done that George. It's great you re-modified the Trilogy and all with new technology but don't destroy the plot, because not even Luke Skywalker is going to have no idea who that person is, and you didn't make Obi-Wan Kenobi look like Ewan McGregor so I don't see why you did that. George try to re-modify Return of the Jedi that way it was before, the face that Luke Skywalker saw him as when he took off that black mask and helmet that Anakin Skywalker needs to live. Alright. That's all I have to say.",1

Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (Taxi Driver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure.

The Force choke is wicked! Then you have Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a simple farm boy who wants to go to the academy, then he and his uncle purchased some droids that have some important information to an old Jedi named Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi(Alec Guinness), who has kept a light-saber from his old student Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader). I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem.

This movie is very childish, full of boring characters that annoy. There is a fight scene where Harrison Ford is shooting at 100s of Robots with lazer guns.

He was so cool as his character who was played by James Earl Jones. The special effects are kind of cheesey, but c'mon it was made in 1977. I mean give it a break.

121,6.0,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Rogue One, it's now time for A New Hope. I get it that it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1977 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the sixth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one today will be The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality improves compared to this one, looking forward to it.",1

I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect.""

Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes ""May the Force be With You"".  So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite).",1

With ""Episode III"" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, ""Star Wars"" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. ""Star Wars"" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established ""Star Wars"" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. ""Star Wars"" was of course followed by the somber ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and the triumphant ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's ""The Phantom Menace,"" 2002's ""Attack of the Clones,"" the aforementioned 2005 conclusion ""Revenge of the Sith"") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with ""Star Wars,"" and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original ""Star Wars"" (1977).",1

I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. ""It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!"" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, ""does Jenna get to go to?"" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking.

Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy.

This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the ""Force"" and those who didn't.

The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor's trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi.

171,10.0,"Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects.  Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major ""good"" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.  Though it does have spectacular effects, this is only to pull the viewer into the great story-telling.",1

The early 70's were a period for American and art-house films, but these two men allowed movies to become fun again. According to Lucas, who created THX-1138 and American Graffiti, the purpose for this movie was just for movies to become fun again. What he did for cinema today, well we have this man to thank for it. This small low-budget sci-fi film spawned six more movies with many more to come. Star Wars has now spread across three generations, three generations of love. I love hearing stories from people who saw this when it came out in 1977. They tell me how much this cultural phenomenon impacted their lives. My father is a mega Star Wars fan, and it's safe to say this is one of his favorite movies. How could such a small movie impact the movie business the way it did? Well, it helps that it's a fabulous movie. The movie features an iconic villain named Darth Vader who is known for his deep breathing noises. We have two incredibly memorable heroes in Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The two most famous robots in movie history are C-3PO and R2-D2. We have everyone's favorite scoundrel in Han Solo, the pilot of the Millennium Falcon and his favorite sidekick Chewbacca, a bear-like Wookiee. So what I'm trying to stay here, is the film has instantly memorable characters. This film pushed new ground with visual effects. Luca's own company, Industrial Light & Magic worked very hard in creating never-before-seen effects from the humming of the lightsabers to the robotic language of R2-D2.

It is no secret that the vast majority of film plots revolve around some version of the ancient `good vs. evil' storytelling structure, and Episode IV is probably the most widely given example of this. The original Star Wars is a shockingly simple presentation of this structure, but it is also an immensely enlarged version of it.

I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. ""Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored."" ""Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over."" So, eventually, I'll get to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi.""

And the acting was done by REAL actors from back in the day. Now a days all I seem to see coming up in the thespian ranks are pretty boys and girls with fake boobs. What happened.

Then the movie started, and when those ships roared across the screen, I just sat there, amazed.  As the film progressed I was introduced to all of the characters that populate this film.  I remember being frightened when I first saw Darth Vader.  I remember the battle over the Death Star, the X-Wings and TIE Fighters blowing up and Luke being chased by Vader.  Then, the Death Star explodes.  Needless to say, I've never forgotten that experience.",1

The opening crawl probably still brings a tear to my eye. Han solo just rocked and Luke skywalker was just adorable. I love the scene in the garbage chute, but my all time favorite scene is when Luke goes outside and looks out to the horizon (the famous shot of the two suns) and the classic music cues up. Oh my god it gives me the chills. awesome!",1

When The Special Edition was getting released into theaters my brother and I were like ""We HAVE to see them!"" So on opening day my brother and I got in line at Tinseltown 290 in Houston to buy four tickets. Standing behind me is a Cinemark employee dressed as Darth Vader. I don't know why I laughed at that moment. We originally wanted the 10:45pm showing but it was sold out and they added an extra showing at 1am. So at 1am myself, my brother, our Dad and our aunt went to see it. The lights went out and some guy behind us yelled ""Chewie!"". You those familiar drums then the Fox logo. Then Lucas Film Ltd the people applauded. Then ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."" There was silence for that. Then the ""Star Wars"" came on the screen the theater applauded loudly. It was great. My brother and I agree George Lucas is a genius. Such imagination. He deserved that AFI Life Acchievment Award this year. George Lucas joins the ranks of Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson among others as a great director. Way to go George!",1

The plot elements are all there for a fairy tale. A white knight, a princess, and an evil lord. When I saw this film for the first time I was eight years old. I saw it on laser disc and it blew my mind. I thought ""This absolutely has to be the coolest movie ever made and that guy in the black costume is the most evil looking guy who ever lived."" I believe Darth Vader was number three on the Best Villain List after The Devil and Adolf Hitler. Even now I still think so. I can't believe there is a single person on the face of the Earth who hasn't seen it and if there is I pity them more than I can say.

Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.",0

It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a poor farm boy who, after meeting old Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins the greatest journey of his life. He goes up against the evil empire and Darth Vader, who has a past with Obi Wan. Not a whole lot happens in this original Star Wars, but it revolutionized sci-fi films as we know them, with battling space ships, laser guns, and hologram communication. The acting and the writing isn't the greatest there's ever been, but it doesn't stop the movie from being completely enjoyable. Star Wars totally deserves the attention it gets and the money it makes from books, video games, TV shows, toys, and it's following sequels.",1

The classic theme of good versus evil in a wonderful movie filled with details and characters to set every sci-fi buff humming. It's magic. It's wondrous. And it's probably one of the most entertaining movies ever made, along with it's sequels. The ""Star Wars"" saga is really a genre of it's own, it's hard to imagine how to compare it to anything else - it stands out from all the rest in an impressive way - no one has ever tried to make anything like it, and if they would, they wouldn't succeed.",1

This is the ultimate wet dream for anyone who like to be blown away by some fantasyadventure, hell...every second of this movie has been spoken about, theories were given just like if ""Star Wars"" was the most important thing ever and in our little fantasyworld it perhaps can be...

It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.",1
231,10.0,"I've seen ""Star Wars"", I don't know HOW many times and I just never get sick of it. It's one of my favorites and one of the greatest movies of all time. A movie that's the perfect combination of great special effects, a great story and memorable characters. All these movies that have been trying to make another ""Star Wars"" over the past two decades generally overlook exactly what made this movie so great in the first place. They tend to just focus on the sets and special effects and overlook the story and characters. George Lucas took great care on all three. A classic movie that will continue to be loved decades from now. Unlike all the Hollywood, big-budget crap coming out these days, this was a low-budget film, but had more magic than all the others put together.",1
232,8.0,"""Star Wars"" was the first movie I ever sat down and watched (I believe I was two at the time). Over time, of course, the initial ""Oh wow!"" factor wears off and it becomes just another sci-fi movie. But it really shouldn't-- this is *the* sci-fi movie. That is not to say it is the best of the entire genre-- I really don't think it is, but this was where everything changed for the last time (other major genre changes occurred in 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Planet of the Apes""). The photography and editing combine very well, making it flow better than almost any film the '70s ever produced. Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) have a great, well-realized, almost love/hate relationship. But the real star of the movie is Darth Vader-- that gigantic black-suited, raspy, evil mastermind who brings new meaning to the word ""power"". This is not only because of James Earl Jones' fantastic voice-over, but also because of David Prowse's physical presence on the celluloid. The movie's vulnerable point comes in the sweeping, epic style, which very nearly overdoes itself on numerous occasions. However, ""Star Wars"" is a classic, even though it cannot really be considered the best of anything. And a word to the wise-- watch the 1977 original. Those special effects shattered doors and set new standards, while the 1997 re-release's cheap digital work only serves to make a good movie look fake and inconsistent.",1
233,,"It is hard to believe that what is really a humble, conventional space opera has become nothing short of an international phenomenon.  Spawning two sequels, a trilogy of prequels, countless merchandising spin-offs and a rabid fan culture, ""Star Wars"" has developed a mythology all its own. Yet, in spite of all the hype, looking back on ""Star Wars"" makes it very easy to see why it has become so popular.",1

235,10.0,"Director George Lucas brings one of the most fantastic pieces of film in cinematic history with the groundbreaking ""Star Wars"". This movie can prove that I am a complete science fiction freak. Farm boy Luke Skywalker has been asked to protect Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader, and the Death Star station. Along the way, he is joined by uncle Obi-Wan Kenobi, the greedy Han Solo and his trusted companion Chewbacca, and two droids named R2-D2 and C3-PO. Throughout the movie, it's a stunning journey that beat the odds of cinema. ""Star Wars"" is one of those epic science-fiction flicks where you already know that you will enjoy it in the end. Let me just say that once those flying credits through the galaxy in the beginning are finished, you are in for a treat. I enjoy everything about this spectacular piece of work. The casting of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, and Carrie Fisher was quite excellent. Even the characters of Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3-P0 seem so memorable. George Lucas delivers an incredible directing job, and brought a lot of his unique imagination to the screen. John William's breathtaking score blew me away, the visual effects are astounding and it puts you into the action, the sound is sense-tickling, the editing is pure genius, the costumes are well unique, and the art direction feels so imaginative. This is one of those movies where it can let you escape the real world, and send you into a world like no other. So, if you are a fan of science fiction, and you enjoy watching George Lucas flicks, then ""Star Wars"" is the movie for you! ""Star Wars"", in my review, ""one of the most imaginable science-fiction movies ever made"".",1
236,10.0,"In honor of May,the official Star Wars month, I will review all the Star Wars movies in chronological order. Now lets start with the New Hope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed big time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero journey and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names like Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world wide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way or an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The impact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres, for instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the superhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this unforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim Burton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated series ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which now dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If you have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!",1

Real people, real feelings and emotions, humor, adventure, The Cantina Bar, Luke getting in touch with the Force within, Han Solo's sarcasm, Obiwan's wisdom...Alec Guiness brings a depth to the role lacking in the recent movies....but then again, all of these elements seem lacking in the recent movies.

Suddenly every 4 and 5 year old child was teleported into a future that existed long ago and in a galaxy far away. ""Star Wars' gave reason to why we see movies in a big and darkened theater. Yes, Star Wars was a phenomenon but it was not THE film changed the movie industry. That was Jaws.",0

A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever want. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is magnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I talking about?

Episode 4 -- The New Hope, is without question the most simple of all the films, but it is also one of the most memorable.

245,10.0,"Of course now it's not really a trilogy anymore is it? But the title refers to episodes 4-6. Now on to the review: Star Wars is hands down the best clash of good and evil any person can find in movies ever. For those who haven't seen it, and shame if you haven't, this one kicks off in the middle of a war in space between the Emperor and the Rebels. Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to. Shortly into the movie the family purchases some droids and Luke soon finds a message hidden in R2D2's data for an Obi Wan Kenobi. Things kick into gear once Luke follows the droid to Kenobi's house and thus begins the adventure. Obi Wan believes that Luke can turn out to be a Jedi just like his father was and takes him under his wing teaching him the way of the Force once they get off Tattooin. During the movie you'll run into the memorable characters like the evil Darth Vader, the cocky Han Solo, Chewy the Wookie, and Princess Leia. Hands down episodes 4-6 are the best trilogy ever created. See it now if you haven't already.",1
246,8.0,"My wife and I saw this in the theater on its first release in 1977, not long after we had finished grad school. We took with us a much older friend of ours (more than a generation older in fact) who wanted to see what all the fuss was about but she was a bit too shy to go by herself. It was all great fun but of course no one in the world could have predicted the entertainment phenomenon this franchise would become. In fact, Star Wars was just a one-and-done intention until its massive popularity fueled the making of TESB. (When the opening credits of the sequel rolled starting with ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"", it was electrifying: everyone looked at each other saying 'What?? this is episode five? what are 1, 2, and 3?"" and Lucas's grand plan was off and running. I'm not sure it would have happened though if the sequel hadn't been better than the original.)",0

It all started with the release of the first Star Wars film just simply titled Star Wars when released in 1977. Obviously, I was born in 2002 and know this film by it's retroactive title, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. But, like many people who have already reviewed this film, this film has had a huge impact on me in many ways. To be honest, as of the time that I wrote this review, the viewing was the first time in a couple of years. Star Wars was released in 1977 and was a surprise hit as nobody had much faith in the project to begin with. The film was such a success that, for a short time, it was the highest grossing film of all time. Critics loved the film upon release and even went on to win some Oscars. The film stars Mark Hamill, the late Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and much more. The film was popular enough that a sequel and an eventual series was made.",1

This was full color with incredible computer generated graphics. There were real live BELIEVABLE aliens up on the screen! We were flying at light speed across galaxies and star systems! And then the movie was over, the house lights came up, and we had to WALK on CONCRETE to our FOSSIL FUELED vehicles and DRIVE on ASPHALT to get home. How B-O-R-I-N-G. How mundane. I had just seen the future, and then when I left the theater it was all jerked away from me. I'll never forget that feeling. The disappointment of ""reality"".

The film deals with a young man (Mark Hamill) who must rescue a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).  Harrison Ford is also along for the ride and veteran British actor Alec Guiness (Oscar-nominated) gives the film a dimension of style and grace that makes the movie work on so many cinematic levels.

I couldn't really figure this out, as there are thousands of possibilities.  But I must say that Star Wars is still as good today as it was 20 years ago.  The special effects were still good, not as impressive as Episode 1 but for the time, they were excellent.  What is weird is that in basic terms Star Wars is just a good vs evil story, but its the way its done with all the other elements interwoven that make it so good.  The end battle scene is the best, and has been copied many times over in numerous inferior films.  I cant really imagine what life would be like without Star wars, i grew up on it and it holds a special place in my memory.  As soon as the now famous score by John Williams starts up you know you're in for something special.  Why can't they make more films like this?",1
266,10.0,"How do you review George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" (1977)? A movie that has become so cherished by millions of fans that most critics disregard it, a movie that has inspired people to create a religion based on the force and a movie that has become so famous that it is regarded as weird not to have seen at least one out of the six films? How do you review it? One of the few ways to actually read balanced reviews of it is to look at what the critics said when it was originally released, thirty-two years ago. At the time, unlike now, where most ""serious"" movie critics treat it with contempt, they liked it. Roger Ebert called the film ""an out-of-body experience,"" and Vincent Canby called the film ""the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure."" These reviews show us, that at the time, just about everybody (Pauline Kael, Jonathan Rosenbaum and Stanley Kauffmann excepted) agreed that ""Star Wars"" was a great film. These are the critics (unbiased) opinions before the days of ""Star Wars"" bashing became fashionable among the critical elite. And take it from me.

I am not a Star Wars fan, and I probably never will be, because I am alienated by the definitive so-called ""special"" editions and I will never get past the fact that I can never, ever see the first film in its original form.

There is no actual battle, we only see Obi Wan moving his lightsaber randomly.<br /><br />But it also has some great scenes. Han Solo is a very fun character, and every single scene with him is incredibly memorable.

Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple. The story is easy to follow, the characterization never complex and we can like all of it because it's so easy to watch.",1

It's also the film that revolutionized the sci-fi category, making all sci-fi films that came after it more realistic and better because of the technology that is used in the films because of Star Wars. Industrial Light and Magic was created that headed the department of technology advancements. Skywalker Sound headed the way in the advancements of film sounds, and George Lucas became a titan in the film industry!! Now on to the movie!! Star Wars simply came out at time in America when we needed it the most. The Vietnam War was wrapping up & Americans needed distraction and something positive to believe in again. Enter Star Wars, a story about a farm boy who it turns out is actually a Prince that joins a ragtag bunch of Rebels that destroys an Evil Empire with the help of a scoundrel-like friend & his good natured dog-like buddy and his Princess sister. A bit far fetched - yes, filled with a bunch of morals that the youth of this nation and other nations around the world needed at the time. As George Lucas has been quoted, it's been very important to him that his movies give youngsters hope, and while we no longer have the tail end of the Vietnam War waging on today Star Wars still brings me and others hope today!! Now to the nitty gritty. The acting. It's good, remember for the most part these are first couple performances minus Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The action is s very good, the special effects - for the time - were outstanding. The sound editing is very good, the soundtrack is great done by genius and legend John Williams, the writing and direction is out of this world by George Lucas.

It manages to integrate all of the elements without anything feeling like it was just stuck in there, and doesn't talk down to anyone. There's no upper or lower age limit on enjoying this or taking it in. If you've got eyes and ears and you have spirit, you're likely to find at least one thing to care for in this, as well as be entertained. The plot is well-written and develops throughout. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, the movie never overwhelms or stands still. There are so many fantastic worlds, vehicles, creatures, languages and designs in the universe that this was the first look into, and it's clear that a lot of care and creativity was the basis for it. Also worth noting is the fact that this could easily be the only Star Wars to be made... it's self-contained, and had no others been done, this would still be a satisfying full story, albeit there would undoubtedly be a vocal demand for more. The action is entertaining and well-done, and certainly intense. The special effects broke new ground, actually inventing techniques for this. Some are dated, though new releases cover much up with CGI(but not to the point of it being obnoxious, or, really, particularly bothersome at all). The scope is amazing, and Lucas somehow pulled it off. The acting varies, but it's never too poor. My fiancée points out that Ford does seem a tad young, considering one of the main personality traits of who he portrays. The cinematography and editing are both top-notch. The score by John Williams is incredible. The sound is unique and aids in the setting of distant planets. There is a little violence, and some disturbing visuals. The DVD holds a commentary track which makes for a good listen. I recommend this to any fan of George Lucas, adventure, science fiction and the medium of film. 10/10",1

I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen –big or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better.",0

Young Luke Skywalker is given possession of two droids but discovers an urgent message recorded within one of them in the vision of Princess Leia seeking help from Obi Wan Kenobi. Unable to fight the evil Empire on his own, he urges Luke to join him. He tells him of his father's seduction into the dark side. Leia is held captive in the Death Star where Darth Vader uses her to locate the Rebel Base. Dazzling and overwhelming visual wonder from curious droids to strange creatures to massive spaceships. Imaginative screenplay by Lucas who previously tested the genre with THX 1138. Mark Hamill plays Luke as someone seeking his destiny. Carrie Fisher displays authority and vulnerability as Leia. Harrison Ford plays hot shot pilot Han Solo of the Millennium Falcon. He owes a large debt and sees this as great financial gain. Finally there is Alec Guinness as wise Obi Wan who will pass the torch to Luke but not before one last confrontation with Vader.

So, I think I should say this straight away; I do *not* think that this film deserves all the praise and all the hype it's gotten over the last 22 years. However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clichés that one more cliché would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like ""Star Wars"" even if I think that e.g. ""Time Bandits"" is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with ""Star Wars"", it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clichés (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched ""Star Wars"" and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10).",0
329,,"Very seldom does a movie appeal to the tastes of everyone.  This movie is not really science fiction although some say it is the best sci-fi movie to date.  It is more of a fairy tale, which is set in a galaxy far, far away. It has all the ingredients of a fairy tale: good vs. evil, the dashing prince charmings coming to the rescue of a princess, and lots of daring do along the way.  It's almost like the story of King Arthur in outer space. What sells it to the audience?  At that time, its special effects were considered a marvel of cinematic movie making.  Today, the special effects would be considered, well, okay.  The characters have become household names: Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kanobi, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia.  People, as a whole, have spent a zillion dollars on Star Wars' toys, video games, etc.  As a result, George Lucas became very rich and famous.  The movie's score is the best masterpiece of cinematic music ever recorded on film.  Lucas does a brilliant job of directing.  The film won 7 Academy Awards.  Harrison Ford became an international super star.  This all says a lot for just one movie!!! (well, not a whole lot...I could have gone on further and wrote a book about the success of this film.)

I don't understand why Obiwan is considered a crazy hermit, when the uncle knew him to be a Jedi knight. I still don't get the flashing lights and buttons on Darth's chest, why didn't Obiwan just use his force powers to switch off the power on the jump suit. Also it is supposed to be about twenty years from episode 3 to episode 4 but Obiwan ages like 40 years. Whats up with that? That whole suicide by Vader thing is incredibly lame, too.

His key problem had always been his inhibiting bashfulness when dealing with people. However, his strongest distinction has always been his shrewdness. Fans of Lucas see his sovereign autonomy as a significant countermeasure to the supreme control of Hollywood, his idealized enterprise to spend (and make) his own money on new innovations and projects that have benefited the rest of the industry as something to be commended. Dissenters, nevertheless, lose hope in what they perceive as a dominating juvenilization of the American film industry in the wake of Star Wars---the watershed that proved that Jaws and Close Encounters were no flukes but the real thing---holding Lucas and Spielberg specially accountable for the gaudy spin-off merchandise-driven summer-blockbuster mentality that has steered the business for the past three decades.",0

It is a wonderful film, on the whole and the Star War franchise is a cornerstone of American culture. But ANH is not without its problems. The start of the story is needlessly convoluted and overextended by about 15 minutes. There simply is not a reason-for theme, character, plot or world-to separate R2D2 and C3PO only to have them reunited 10 minutes later. Indeed the film has about 20 minutes of fat that could have been tightened up on the page. This is hardly surprising as Lucas is a weaker writer.

348,8.0,"Oh, boy. Reviewing a film that so many critics have been writing about is so hard, but also deserves a try for sure. The original Star Wars is not that kind of movie you love because it's so well made or so complex and deep; you love it because it makes you happy. George Lucas back in the day didn't want to create the perfect sci-fi movie (he says so in a Rolling Stones review), as that was ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in his opinion; he wanted to make something special in its lightness, a space opera not focusing on space (as did its future rival, Star Trek), but on a very, very simple story of a rescue (and later on in the saga, a family). Each character is just perfect in his role: Luke, the hero, with his strong sense of duty; Han Solo, the roughneck, a guy whose role in the universe is not yet written but soon will be; Princess Leia, a role model for girls at a time when a woman leading a group of adventurers was just fantasy. And this is just the main squad. I won't dwell on the amazing comedic commentary by the two droids (one of which, without a single word, became the favorite character of many fans!), the ominous figure of the mysterious Darth Vader and the mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the delicate role of introducing us to the mystical side of this world, the Force. No movie is perfect for me, and in this case I'll have to state the one, unimportant flaw in the whole original trilogy: the acting in itself isn't great and some points of the plot are off. That said, the chemistry between the actors is palpable and the story is so funny, you don't need to stress every aspect of it.",1

350,10.0,It's amazing how this movie still works as well as it does. I think there are two main components to the original Star Wars's success as a film. The first is Lucas' embrace of Joseph Campbell's model of mythic storytelling.

The second is how the story gets integrated into the largely implied larger universe of Star Wars.,1

This movie has crossed all culture barriers, with characters, lines, and creatures all well known from one set of movies. You have to live under a rock to not know some of the story lines, statements and characters from this film. The funny thing is how some special effects from this movie look BETTER than some effects made in the 2000's (The Rock in Mummy Returns, anyone??)

Science fiction needs to develop, dwell on, and often to strike the audience with awe over a plausible scientific or technological development greatly surpassing what we know.  Lucas pondered early on with John Williams whether the character of the music should be electronic- mystical, as science fiction would suggest.  They decided against it-- and can anyone doubt that Williams's actual score captured the true texture of the film much better?  Set in ""a galaxy far, far away"" though it was, the music and almost everything else stressed the familiar rather than the strange.

He had to fancy it up with computer generated bits and pieces that, like plastic surgery on a beautiful woman, only served to fake it up. It used to be chunky and real. You felt like you could reach out and touch the spaceships. Like you could really smell the Wookie. But now it's just another Lucasfilm cartoon. At best, a trailer for the current unholy trilogy. I want my Star Wars back. My old reliable beloved Star Wars. Where is it George? Why isn't it on DVD? I'm hardly alone in my feelings here. Star Wars has a massive fan base but how come it's been so roundly ignored? Surely everyone wants the original versions. At the very least, the option to watch the original versions on the special edition disks. That would be great. Maybe Lucas is going to make us pay for the special editions and then, in a few years time, release the originals and shake us down some more. He knows we'll pay, and money does appear to be the only thing he cares about. When George was young he was like Luke Skywalker, then for a while he was Obi Wan but now he's forever Jabba, vile gangster and ravager of fans. Thanks. I had to get that off my chest.

Anyways, this movie was a landmark when it first came out. It was one of the only sci-fi movies released that doesn't have an alien invasion as the focus. This movie is engagingly original and feels very inspired. It also feels very 80's but in a good way. The effects still hold up very well. Maybe that's because the effects keep being updated but my point still stands. The space scenes are still impressive and are still a lot of fun to watch. The lightsaber duels on the other hand, are pretty weak. Even one of the most intense scenes in the movie: the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Darth Vader, let's face it, is just two guys tapping lit-up swords. It's still an intense scene so it doesn't bother me that much but compared to the action scenes in the other Star Wars films, it's really underwhelming. Me and my brother used to joke about that. The story might be a bit cliché by today's standards as a classic underdog story but do I care? No because all the new ideas here are just so interesting and awesome! The characters in this movie are all iconic. Darth Vader was cool in this movie until the stupid prequels came out, but other than that, all the characters are awesome!

I saw it several times in it's original theatrical run, then I saw it a couple of times on each subsequent re-release. The last time I watched Star Wars in a theater (excluding the 1997 special edition) was in 1985 at a drive-in theater. In 8 years... the total number of visits I made to the big-screen to see Star Wars ... 21. There are two or three things that make Star Wars the best movie ever made. First, there were those incredible special effects. Special effects are not a big deal any more. Last summer I saw ""War Of The Worlds"" and, while I enjoyed the movie, I wasn't that impressed as the aliens blasted people out of their clothes and annihilated the bridge next to Tom Cruise's home. I've seen movies in the past few years in which the main star of the movie doesn't exist, except in the mind of the creator and in a computer. Anything a writer/producer/director can possibly imagine can be stunningly rendered on the screen using CGI. Such was not the case in 1977. As the camera paned down to the surface of Tatooine after the opening crawl, showing Vader's ship closing in on Princess Leia's ship, it was breathtaking... Like standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon. No one had ever done anything like this before. Star Wars was first and foremost a special effects movie. Second, the story. Our world was in turmoil throughout the 70's. The Soviet Union was at the top of their game. The US was torn and devastated by the Vietnam war. A President resigned in disgrace. Inflation was killing the financial future of the working man. We waited in line to buy gas. Americans were being held hostage in Iran. Hollywood was cranking out great movies. The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now and Chinatown were the top movies of the 70's. Some of the best movies ever made, but notice that all of them are somewhat dark. Godfather is a bloodbath and the ending shows evil winning out over Michael Corleone's soul. In Cuckoo's Nest our hero enters an institution a fun-loving goof ball and suffers a terrible death. Taxi Driver is about darkness and evil pushing a man into insanity. I could go on.. Even those famous disaster flicks of the 70's consider it a happy ending if 6 people out of 1000 survive (Poseidon Adventure). Star Wars gave us a good old fashioned battle between good and evil... and good prevailed. Sure, we felt loss when Vader struck down Obi Wan, but Obi Wan's spirit continued through out the rest of the movie as if his death didn't occur. At the end, after an emotional battle and a bit of a twist, with great ceremony, the hero's are honored and the closing credits roll to John William's majestic score. In 1977, there were very few movies you walked out of, feeling like you had lived a fantasy, feeling like you were there. But I was in that auditorium when Leia placed those medals on Luke and Han's neck. I wanted that feeling over and over and that's why I saw it every chance I got. In the early 80's I paid $150 for a bootleg VHS video, shot right off the screen of a theater, complete with washed out color and the flicker caused by the different frame rates of TV and motion pictures. When Star Wars was first released on video, the price for a VHS cassette was over a hundred dollars and I purchased it then. I purchased it again when it became available on Laser Disc, and again when they released the ""definitive collection"" (widescreen with Dolbly Pro-Logic Surround) on Laser Disc. I bought it again when the DVD became available. I will probably buy it one final time if/when it's released on high-definition video (added in 2012-I have the set on Blu Ray). That's how much I love this movie. ""Empire"", ""Jedi"" and the prequels were all great motion pictures, but only Star Wars (today known as ""Episode IV- A New Hope"") had the magic... because it had never been done before. I understand why my kids don't share my enthusiasm. There is absolutely nothing a film maker can do to get the ""wow factor"" back. At no time did anyone say ""how did they do that"" when aliens were vaporizing humans in ""War of the Worlds"". I don't give special effects a second thought any more. I understand why some people call Star Wars over rated. But I also understand why it ranks #2 in all-time domestic gross and has been near the top of the AFI's list of 100 best movies ever made for the past 20 years. The magic of Star Wars can not and will not ever be repeated. The reason: Prior to 1977, you couldn't even imagine such realistic images ever being filmed. Today, anything you can imagine, you can see (yawn). Star Wars is the greatest triumph in movie-making and deserved to get a Oscar for Best Picture of the millennium. It saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy, it began the tradition of the Summer Blockbuster (along with Jaws), it started the special effects revolution and made going to the movies an 'experience'",1

But for someone watching this now, it's not so good.<br /><br />The first half drags. But it slowly picks up the pace. They spend so much time creating alien creatures which was pretty unnecessary.

Lucas probably wanted just to show some aliens.<br /><br />They looked disgusting and were pointless.<br /><br />I wish there were scenes of Luke being trained. That was over within a minute and wasn't good.<br /><br />Whole shooting looked bad. It was so obvious none of them knew how to handle a gun.<br /><br />The fight between Darth Vader and Kenobi was the worst. It was so lame. If those people are the best with Lightsaber, maybe they should've gone for some other weapon.<br /><br />The acting was pretty bad too. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness was alright.<br /><br />And the final fight was pretty stupid.

Then you have the characters: Darth Vader, the perfect villain; C-3P0, the camp droid; and the bickering duo of Leia and Han.

The cast are all fantastic, each actor delivering an iconic performance, my favourite would have to be Harrison Ford as the witty and sarcastic Han Solo, probably one of the most well written sci-fi characters there is and he suits the role perfectly, James Earl Jones' voice-over work as Darth Vader is also one of the most memorable in film history, the actors always play a large contribution to a films success, and it was all great casting decisions made here. Watching this movie is like watching a piece of film history, every scene is in some way noteworthy, whether it be a well known line, music or just a characters action, no moment goes unnoticed.

Chances are you'll have already seen the movie and either love it or hate it, or you're one of those strange beings who has reached adulthood without seeing any of the series and have no doubt already formed a dismissive opinion of the space opera. The best approach is to simply talk about the film from a personal point of view, as if any movie has had such a personal effect on an audience, it's Star Wars.

From the addicting music in the Cantina to the epicness of the destruction of the death star.",1
420,10.0,"To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed. But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.",1

427,9.0,"Note: this review was done while watching the 2019 version of the film available on Disney+. The original ""Star Wars"" trilogy are the movies, off the top of my head, with the largest amount of different versions out there, aside from ""Blade Runner."" We have the original theatrical versions (1977/80/83), the ""Special Editions"" (1997), the 2004 DVD releases, the 2011 Blu-ray releases, and now finally the 2019 versions that are available on Disney+, which are supposedly just shelved 2012 4K remasters that George Lucas had intended to use as the basis for 3D theatrical re-releases of his six films before Disney purchased Lucasfilm. Most of the changes that have been made in the forty-plus years of the film's existence are incredibly minor and unnoticeable. In my opinion, the only parts where changes are really unbearable and detracting of the overall quality of the film are the Mos Eisley scenes, where most of the CGI characters and environments were added in the 1997 version. My guess is that Lucas added them simply as a trial run before ""The Phantom Menace"" was released, because that movie contains a lot of similar Tatooine effects to the ""Special Edition."" These additions may have been done with good intention, but they're incredibly dated now and haven't really been updated at all since they were added to the movie over twenty years ago. The reason that I'm even mentioning all of the different versions of ""Star Wars"" in the first place is that I do feel that it is important to mention what version of the movie that I'm basing my review around. The new version available on Disney+ is not the same version of the movie that audiences first experienced in 1977, nor is it the one re-experienced in 1997 or in subsequent home releases. Like I said, most changes are small and unnoticeable, but the bigger ones do detract from the overall pacing and tone of the movie (such as the Greedo and CGI Jabba scenes), and they must be factored into my review of the movie, as should any such Director's Cut or Extended Edition of any film. Thankfully, the weird violet tint of more recent home media releases is gone, so at least the majority of the movie is much prettier and more natural looking again.",0

430,10.0,"You know this film. You know the characters. You know the music. Why is a review even being written? Star Wars: A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it: the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed. For the first time in history, you really felt like you were in an alternate universe in space (Hush 2001: A Space Odyssey fans, Star Wars didn't separate its audience from the subject with ridiculously sublime yet frustrating subtle imagery that never quite explained what was going on).",1
431,3.0,"This film with its campaign of spin-off toys, T-shirts, mugs etc created hype as we know it and set the pattern for the hype surrounding Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and He-Man. No wonder Mel Brooks spoofed it in Spaceballs (""Spaceballs, the flame thrower""!) It's one of the most overrated films ever made. It came top in Channel 4's list of the 100 greatest films but frankly Star Wars coming top in that poll and The Godfather coming No2 is a bit like Joe Dolce's Shaddapayourface beating Ultravox's Vienna to No1 in the UK music charts in 1981. It is not that great a film and the people who let it take over their lives and boast about having seen it tens of thousands of times are very sad. As Carrie Fisher says ""It's a great movie, but get a life"". George Lucas said he was wanting to recreate the spirit of the old Flash Gordon serials and he did to a degree succeed. Looking at it now, it looks as dated as Flash Gordon. The art deco spaceships in Flash Gordon exude the air of the 1930s and there are some hairstyles and clothes in this film that are very reminiscent of the awful fashions of the 1970s.The scene where Luke and Han Solo are shooting at the enemy spaceships has the look of a 1970s arcade game. Like Flash Gordon a lot of the dialogue is very corny (in fact it dismayed Harrison Ford when he read the script). The cheesiest line has to be when Luke Skywalker sees the hologram of Princess Leia and says ""Who is she? She's beautiful."".It is so overpoweringly cheesy it is like having your nose shoved in Stilton. OK, there's no denying Carrie Fisher is a very nice looking woman but ""beautiful"" is a bit extreme. Mind you I think if the film was being made nowadays Luke would say ""Who is she? She's hot"". Sir Alec Guinness didn't like this film either despite receiving a sizeable chunk of the profits. He would discard any fan letters he received that made mention of Star Wars. There must have been lorryloads of discarded letters leaving his house every day when the film first came out1",0
432,10.0,"The original editing is best. Naturally when the re releases came, Hollywood felt the need to add things that were unnecessary. One little creature punching another at Mos Eisley was overdoing it. Also, Hollywood critics revise history by saying they gave it positive reviews upon initial release. They did not. Only 30 years later when it's a classic they are all positive. Why do you think they didn't want to accept Lucas' idea when he first proposed it? He had to make it, himself. Critics miss. We must deal with this fact. Why do organic blockbusters never garner a sweep of the awards given at the end of a broadcast? By that I mean best picture director actor and actress? By organic, I mean word of mouth magical feeling blockbusters with no Hollywood hype? Ones that feel like Star Wars episode 4?",0
433,10.0,This is together with The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi my favorite movie of all time.

In this film you can see the influences from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey and the wizard of oz. And I also like how it doesn't set it at an exact place and time so it doesn't get outdated.

I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top.  The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting.  Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff.  But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after ""American Grafitti.""

Ok, to be honest, the last two films so far have sucked, let's hope Lucas gets it right with ""Attack of the Fools"". Come what may--no pun intended--I don't think we'll see Episodes 7, 8, and 9.

I won't get in to that except to say that they are his films, and he can do with them as he will. That aside, this film is one of those great movies that has just a purely awesome story, is not boring for adults and yet it is MPAA rated such that the young can also enjoy it without being bombarded by violence or vulgar language.

The characters are all charming. The action is unpredictably intense. And as the first Star Wars movie ever, the visuals and special effects has lived up many years later.

469,7.0,"I'll say what I enjoyed first:<br /><br />The score- Wow, easily one of the greatest scores of all time. Makes the movie for me honestly. Scenes that would've been terrible without it were redeemed, it's completely original and John Williams killed it.<br /><br />Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford- The two best characters in the movie acted by the two best actors in the film.<br /><br />Special effects- It's fairly obvious as the movie goes on that it focuses heavily on its, at the time, crazy good special effects. The work and love that went into this movie are most evident in its countless sets and practical effects.<br /><br />Now to the bad:<br /><br />It's not original- It's simple really, Lucas even admits it, the plot follows the basic mono myth of the young farm boy taking on an empire. Nothing we haven't seen before except this time it's covered in gibberish names and space garbage.<br /><br />The Acting, Dialogue, and Characters- It's so wooden. It's not the worst I've ever seen but the way people talk about this movie is as if it isn't bad. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fishers performance are so over exaggerated. All the side characters such as the imperial officers and Luke's uncle and aunt are just terrible. Their are some great quotes spattered around that are memorable and great but the in-between is just cringey and cliche. The great Alec Guiness would agree with me and he's a part of it. The characters are just card board cuts of classic personalities. Luke is a dislikable protagonist who whines and complains the whole movie and is somehow a master at everything he touches. Han I have no complaints with, he's great. Obi wan is cool and all but nothing we haven't seen before in an old wise mentor. C3po is so freakin annoying and such a useless character, he gets far to much screen time. Leah doesn't do anything except sit back and watch the other characters do all the work.

The beauty Lucas has created for us is beyond belief, the references to Greek mythology and older Sci-fi sagas are intelligent, and the bursts of comic relief here and there are calculated.

Harrison Ford remains the star of the show, and without his magnetic presence, the film would lose a lot of its appeal. There's also Darth Vader who remains an iconic villain to this day.

488,10.0,"Whatever else George Lucas does in his career, and no matter how Episode III turns out, what no one can take away from him is that in Star Wars he created, IMHO, the greatest two hours of film in cinema history. And that's ignoring the fact that it's the first part in what is, again IMHO, the greatest movie trilogy of all time. There's probably nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before, but who cares, I'll say it anyway. My thoughts on what makes this film so good are difficult to list in only a 1000 words, but here goes. ",1
489,9.0,"Star Wars was the movie that showed you could use special effects and make it look ""special."" Who is going to forget the end of the movie, with Luke Skywalker shooting through the canyon on the Deathstar, attempting to the be hero. How wonderful did that look the first time you saw it? Nowadays, that is easy for computers to reproduce, but the scale and scope of the effects by George Lucas and his team is what created the sheer awe and joy of Star Wars. The story is not bad either. A classic Western story with clearly defined good and bad guys, with Eastern Mythology thrown in there to add a mystical element, this first movie is actually the forth chapter of what will eventually be 6 (maybe 9?) movies, set the foundation shrewdly of what has become one of the world's most popular science fiction series. The essential characters, some of the back stories, and wonders of the Galaxy far far away are all introduced, and giving the audience a pretty good time while at it. Originally produced as a stand alone movie, the people at Fox Studios had no confidence that Star Wars would succeed so plans for the following sequels were not on the drawing board, Star Wars is entertaining, but do leave us with enough questions about the Force and Darth Vader and the unseen Emperor that when the following movies do come out, the audience was more than ready to embrace them, and make Star Wars the most successful science fiction series ever.",1
490,8.0,"On the one hand, there is boundless longing for science and technology, and on the one hand, the return to the narrative tradition of myths and stories. The sloppy death, the scene of 3P0 and R2 in the desert is the most classic, the soft curve and texture of 3PO are derived from the robot Maria in ""Metropolis"", and later the nature of robots like Wali,Even though the special effects of ""Star Wars"" seem so simple today, it does not prevent this sci-fi pioneer from being a timeless classic. It has an epoch-making significance in the technological revolution of film production. The tension of the plot, the exciting soundtrack, the wonders about the universe are so amazing, creating this fascinating dream of light and shadow.",1

493,,"Star Wars is one of those films, I fear, which, while undoubtedly good, has been idolized to a ridiculous degree: to such an extent, in fact, that I believe there are actually sad losers out there who have turned Star Wars into some sort of religion or way-of-life (a bit like the Trekkies with Star Trek).  While I must admit that I enjoy the film and its sequels myself, they're not THAT good, and some of their scenes and special effects (especially in the first) are looking embarrassingly dated by now eg the computers in the Death Star, and virtually everything in the climactic final scenes over that feared Imperial construction.",1
494,8.0,"Second only to the sequel The Empire strikes back, I prefer the sequel only because it had a tighter plot and a shocking twist. In fact I was actually late starter when it came to Star Wars, I watched it for the first time when they re-released the trilogy in 97. It would be fair to say when I watched it I was completely spellbound, for a ten year old this was movie heaven. All the characters are legendary, Han Solo,Luke Skywalker,Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi and who could forget the tyrant otherwise known as Darth Vader. The plot was pretty flimsy but Star Wars is just so much fun you probably wouldn't care. Out of all the main characters Harrison Ford had the most success,going onto Raiders of the lost ark and many more blockbusters. The John Williams score is one of my favourite movie scores along with Superman and Raiders of the lost ark. Star Wars was a monumental success, a success both sequels were going to repeat. In my opinion George Lucas should have left it at three, The Phantom menace was disappointing, Attack of the clones was no better and revenge of the sith was decent. Star Wars created the summer blockbusters and movies like POTC owe Star Wars a huge debt.",0
495,4.0,"I have just seen this movie at my boyfriend's house (and I apologize for offending anyone who keeps reading this) but I have to say...WOW. I truly cannot BELIEVE this is so popular. I am beside myself in shock. Don't get me wrong - Episodes I and II are GREAT - LOVE THEM, but the original was so laughable. It was like watching a parody of the real thing. (Chewy is hysterical just by himself.) R2-D2 is adorable, he is just SO cute I could barely make it through his scenes. C3PO is a doll too, but they are just about all that was enjoyable about the movie. ***NO OFFENSE.*** Thank goodness for modern special effects! I'm watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" tomorrow...we'll see. I have been told that it's a love story. Sounds good....",0
496,10.0,"A true sci-fi cinamatic marvel. I could almost imagine how awesome it was when it came out in 1977. Even though it's doesn't have as good looking of effects and picture like today's movies, but back then it was probably as spectacular for those people back when it was new as much as we see and think of movies today. A New Hope doesn't have much of any slow parts at all in the film. It also has good acting, great fight scenes, and of course a great and clever story to begin one of the most popular trilogies of all time. There isn't much movies out there like any of the Star Wars movies. A sci-fi classic.",1
497,10.0,I'm not sure where Hollywood went wrong with the latest renditions of Star Wars. You can't beat the classics. The original Star Wars will always be my one and only favourite film of the franchise. The move away from George Lucas' original vision is disappointing.,0
498,10.0,This I admit is not so much a review as it is an ode.,0
499,1.0,I know everyone has seen this thing by now so it's not like I'm saying anything really new. Star Wars is one of the worst movies I had seen up until the time it came out. (I was there the first time ... definitely not impressed.) The special effects were poor even for the nineteen seventies.I mean the small models used for the fighter planes (spaceships?) are obvious. The hulls look as if they were made out of brick not metal. Of course there are no explosions in outer space but why let basic facts interfere with a (bad) story. . And what is an aristocracy doing in a society advanced enough for space travel? That arrogant princess should have been the first one to be zapped.,0
500,5.0,"This is by far the worst film in the trilogy, in part due to a low budget and the difficult task of finding the right tone and figuring out how this fictional universe ought to work. Back then, Luke and Leia were not yet brother and sister, and I guess it was unclear whether Han or Luke should become the ultimate hero. It seems Lucas wanted Luke to be the hero, but in the following two films he is really just a part of the subplot about the 'force' and his issues with Vader. But real drama and action revolve around Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang. Han is the real hero, Luke remains an awkward, and disturbingly sterile character reminiscent of a munk and hopelessly lacking in testosterone to even try to be the hero.<br /><br />Anyway, while a lot in this film is really fun to watch, the plot is not very engaging, some scenes come across as clumsy, and the ending is not nearly as exciting as the opening of the film.",0

It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture, director and supporting actor Alec Guiness. For all those categories it was nominated also for an Oscar. The movie won 7 Oscars, but only in technical categories, while the one for best picture went to Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"". Many were outraged at that Oscar decision, but I think this is one of the few times I would agree with the academy.",1
505,1.0,"A Macdonald's meal of a movie, all fat sugar salt and caffeine, supersized with whiz bang special effects. Tastes great while you're eating it, but short on nourishment. They did it well enough that this junk food has squeezed pretty much everything good off the menu. The pic is just mediocre, but the trends it started have been horrid. Cornball plotting and dialog is one thing, but the simple-minded good vs. evil masquerading as some sort of authentic spirituality is vomit inducing. The sequel, with its Freudian undertones, has some real conflict and character development and is actually a pretty good popcorn movie.

The craze is almost like Macy's thanksgiving parade and Micheal Jackson's live performance. Finally, i decided to star watching all the movies.",1
508,10.0,"For me, this movie started it all, and it is the best - hands down. Those special effects were actually very special for their time and groundbreaking. Not only were they stunning for the period, they didn't take away from performers' skills. The directing, writing and scripting were all formulaically fun frolics resulting in a well-paced struggle between space-evil and space-good. I regret, I am no snotty self-loving scientific academic, so my opinion is just that, an opinion (kind of like a dis-provable theory)..nor does it have a price tag, like all them ""collegiate-right conclusions"" if they are what the government wants, you get another grant...wink-wink. OK - a silent dig, and now I am done with that part. Yes, this movie reminds of that 70's romp, ""Flesh Gordon"" – minus the flesh. Each character (with the exception of 'The Princess') was riddled with flaws and prone to errorand that is what made them very likable and relatable. Luke is some goofy kid from the space-burbs, aching to drive any old space crafteven if it is the up-galaxy space-bus; Hans is a bombastic and roguish misfit (ending up being only a hero in his own mind) and Chewbacca is that well-trained pet of Solo, who's excellent training is reflected in a keen adherence to rules, avoiding piddling on space-carpets and not destroying the space newspaper. The galactically-challenged Princess Leia Orgasm, from the planet Spermicide, starts out as some kind of young, punk-brutish femme, whose raging hermones greatly hampers her ability to complement anyone. Of course nothing time and events expedites rapid maturity. By the end of the story, Luke gets a light-stick; Hans envies the size of Luke's light-stick; Chewbacca wants to fetch Luke's light-stick and Leia ends up being an even angrier Leia. That is not all the fun...oh no. I forgot to mention that Garth (""I am your Father"") Vader and Luke end up in a very intense climax, comparing light-sticks to one-another. Now as important a scene as this might be, I wish never to witness this again. Alec Guinness plays a nice old guy (Oldy One Can-o-pea?) and junkie-master whose flaccid light-stick is no match for Vader's. Of course you can't forget General/Admiral Peter Cushing who always plays badder than bad, minus from the poison from the Bad Force. I guess while I am mentioning main characters, I should talk about the two BOTs. R2D2 and C3POI can't say enough. To put it mildlythe beeps and buzzes were cute for kidsbut for meirritating. With all this bad ju-ju, this is a movie I can watch over and over. Ulike the other Star War movies, this picture had some charisma, great characters and CGI struggled enough to play second-fiddle to everyone.",1

But Star Wars is a very good and entertaining film too, and even if many of its themes are more fantasy than SF, the power lies in the images. They're simply magical! From the Star Destroyer entering the screen from the top to the seedy Mos Eisley bar, from the funny robots to the Millennium Falcon, from the Double Sunset to the Deathstar attack, this film is filled with fantastic images which let us gladly overlook any cheesiness ore plot holes or whatever. If you grew up with Jim Burns' and Chris Foss' covers for SF paperbacks, Star Wars is a dream come true and alive.",1

513,8.0,"It's difficult to come up with a franchise more iconic than ""Star Wars."" Its cultural impact and effect on filmmaking is legendary. The epic Saga of a galaxy far, far away is one that will continue to stand the test of time for generations to come. And all the imagination captured by these classic stories, all the hysteria it brought out among its fervent fanbase, all started with a movie that made it into fewer than 32 theaters on opening day. So, what do I have to say about the first installment in my favorite film franchise of all time? While ""A New Hope"" is a decent film on its own, and I'm beyond grateful that it became such a massive financial success, from a filmmaking standpoint, it's easily the worst of the original trilogy. Does that make it a bad movie? No. GOD no. That said, it is FAR from great and certainly one of the Saga's weakest installments.",0
514,6.0,"Might as well get it out there. Sci-fi ""almost"" never age well, and this is no exception. Consider episode 1,2,3 vs 4,5,6. (ok ..I,II,III vs IV,V,VI). Look at the original Alien, all the lights inside the ship looks so lo-tech. A2 is kind of like Nam. A3 bit better with Fincher - but story a bit awkward. Now look at Blade Runner - it is superb on blu ray - but maybe not in 2054. The more recent Matrix will probably look like cheese comes 10 yrs time.",1
515,10.0,"Being born 19 years after this movie was released, I never got a chance to see it in theaters. I was even too young to see the re- releases in 1997. My father first exposed me to these movies when I was about 5 years old, when I couldn't quite grasp just how big these movies were and how much of an impact they had on American, and even world culture. Back in 1977, the world was hurting. It couldn't tell the difference between tyrants and leaders in politics, and villains and heroes both on and off the screen. Star Wars changed that. Whether you think it's overrated or the best movie ever, it would be foolish to say that this movie didn't change anything, be it Hollywood, our perception of leaders, or even our perception of ourselves. This movie, and it's subsequent saga, is, likely, the single most talked about movie in history. If you don't like it, you've at least seen it. If you haven't seen it, you've no doubt at least heard about it. That being said, that means that just about everything has been said about Star Wars. It's great, it's bad, it's overrated, the acting isn't exactly on point, the effects are breathtaking, it's corny, it's nerdy, it's geeky, it's a phenomenon, it's just plain good, everything has been mentioned. So why am I writing this review? Because that means I get to contribute to the story. The story of Star Wars goes far beyond its own universe. We are part of it. The fans, the haters, George Lucas, me, you reading this, now, we're all part of the story of Star Wars. This review may get lost among the thousands and thousands of others, but I still get to contribute to the preservation of this story. The more we talk about it, the longer it'll stay in memory, and the longer it'll exist. When the movies are finished, possibly forever, the story will still live on for future generations to enjoy. Now I get to be part of that story.",1
516,7.0,"It's not a GREAT movie is you just watch it now, and it's even less impressive if you watch the pre-special edition version. The reason is simple: This movie was a milestone in Sci-Fi when it came out 22 years ago, but now there's lots of competition for that style and special effects.",1
517,10.0,"An epic movie about good vs evil. Many can agree with me in saying this is the most recognizable and one of the be movies of the action/adventure genre. The way the story flows and is put together is astounding. While some of the special effects of the original can't stand up to modern era films, it is great that they rereleased the films with updated effects. The movie is also filmed very well. The characters in the movie were set up great too. Their stories all went well with one another, and many of the scenes in this movie are amazing. I specifically like Obi Wans Death Scene, and the Death Star Battle and Destruction. Can't wait for Episode 9 and am anticipating a great film.",1
518,9.0,"A New Hope is one of those movies that will never be forgotten and will be watched over and over again and never get old. It's beautifully shot, the use of practical effects is breathtaking and everything feels realistic. That's the best thing of the entire movie and not just entire movie, probably the best thing of the entire original trilogy. Characters are relatable, but it just feels like they are not fleshed out enough, but more of that will come in the sequels. While I really like this movie, I don't consider it a masterpiece mostly for the reason I said in the previous sentence. There are just good guys and bad guys. I know they have that charm, but it's just not enough to me. Now more about good sides, the movie isn't boring for one second. The action is very well done, the story is simple and it's perfect to relax. While some scenes are action-heavy, some of them are pure beauty (the double sunset scene is one of my favorites in the series and also one of the most iconic). And what I like the most is what a universe it establishes in just 2 hours and is yet to be expanded in the sequels. Usually big universes like this are made in books or TV shows, at least successfully, but they made such a huge one in just few movies and expanded it with animated series and comics. Back in 1977, before the release, who could expect this would become such an iconic, timeless and immortal franchise. No one took this seriously on shooting except George Lucas and few more people. The story of making this movie, inspires me very much and makes me believe that even when you're hopeless you can succeed in achieving what you want. And, just one more iconic thing that can't go unmentioned is John Williams' brilliant score and after watching a movie you will catch yourself humming one of the tracks from the score. While this movie has flaws, it's still a classic that will never be forgotten.",1

521,1.0,"$TAR WARS$ (c) is badly made, particularly the special effects, the editing, the acting, the cinematography, the dialogue and the excruciating final scene. Worst of all, it is badly imagined.  By that I mean it is trite, with a mindless plot and without any original characters.  All this nonsense about icons and popular culture doesn't alter the fact that it is junk. To say it is one of the best s-f movies ever made is not saying much. All but a few s-f moves are nothing but escapism, and many of those are better than this. I have no problem with people being passionate about movies they enjoy. I love Old Yeller, but I would hardly call it the greatest movie ever made. The second was better - the battle scenes at the beginning, the ""freezing"" of Han and the battle between Darth and Luke. The third one was unforgivable.  Ewoks and that cheesy ending that would make Frank Capra vomit.",0
522,10.0,"I don't remember well what is the plot of the movie since my first and latest watch of the movie was a half year ago. But, I do remember my admiration when I watch this movie. You know, I watched it when the year is 2013, and the movie's released date is 1977. During those three decades the movie's visual effects change dramatically. Yet, ""Stars Wars"" is different. With all of the editor skill and their work hard, even in 1977 they can make film that has amazing visual effect as good as early twenty-first-century-movies. Of course, in my opinion, it is like ""The Lord of The Rings Trilogy"" of the twentieth century.",1

What about characters or good actors? The whole story occurs to me as just an introduction to the sequels. Why is there such an enormous cult about this crappy little SF-flick?

527,1.0,"The problem with this movie is the script.  It just never rises above the level of a Flash Gordon episode.  The camera work is pedestrian.  The pacing is glacial except for the last ten minutes and the back and forth storytelling (a problem in all the Star Wars movies, but especially those directed by Mr. Lucas) never lets any momentum build.  Like ""Phantom Menace"" and espcially ""Attack of the Clones"", Lucas just doesn't know how to write a ""scene"".  What we get is like a quilt of little bits that are cobbled together.  Each with basically the same pace.  The saving grace of ""Star Wars"" is some of the acting.  Alec Guinness really brightens up the screen whenever he's on.  And Peter Cushing brings some genuine class and star quality.  I saw this movie again recently and I was stunned by what a big bore it is.  I can't imagine how anyone over the age of 20 could be thrilled by it.",0
528,,"Frankly, I really cannot understand why everyone loves this movie so much. The story is corny and really not science fiction at all (it's fantasy--there IS a difference!), the acting is not very good (especially not Mark Hamill, the main character, who is just sort of bland-o), and though the special effects were groundbreaking in 1977, if the movie were released today they would only be so-so. I think the reason for the film's continued popularity is because at the time it was released, the enormous baby boom generation were all teens and twenty-somethings, the right age market for a movie of this type. Now they've all told their kids about how *great* it was, and now *they're* all flocking to see it, just like their parents did, based only on what they've heard. The forty- and fiftysomethings love it because it reminds them of when they were young too. It's nothing more than nostalgia and word of mouth. Why this movie instead of others that were released in the late '70's? Well, perhaps because it *is* the first movie released with the type of overblown special effects we've all gotten used to in ""science fiction"" movies. Hollywood just doesn't know what makes a good movie anymore. I suppose story, script and acting don't matter. Just lots of eye-candy. And this has always appealed to a young market. Like I said, if this same movie were released today for the first time, it would be quickly forgotten. I find it reprehensible that this type of comic-book action flick is now the definition of ""science fiction."" It's nothing more than fantasy; true science fiction makes you think. The best example of a *good* science fiction movie is still ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" A more recent example is  the underrated ""Contact."" No, neither of these movies have laser-gun battles, cutesie-pie aliens, or dark space lords. But those are the creations of Hollywood and really have nothing to do with science. My point is not to ruin anyone's good time--it's a harmless movie and fine for kids to watch and for middle-agers with arrested development still living with their parents, but it should be pointed out that this overrated movie is mediocre Hollywood entertainment, *not* great movie-making. I rest my case.",0

It took our family close to a year to get tickets so all of our family could see it together, and immediately it entered my subconscious as probably the most exciting two hours I'd had in the cinema up to that point in my 14 years. 20 years later (and multiple viewings), I had an equally thrilling experience by attending a concert of John Williams music at the Hollywood Bowl, conducted by Williams himself, and when the large orchestra struck up the ""Star Wars"" theme, the whole bowl erupted into enormous cheers, even greater than any of his other stunning movie blockbuster themes.",1

The scenes I like best are the opening scene with the background planet covering the screen all the way long, the scene of Luke thinking and watching the suns of his home planet as the evening falls and as a wonderful music shows his feelings, and the battle just after the 'escape' from the Death Star. The only not so good thing I can say about Star Wars is... Mark Hamill. He's the main actor and looks like he's the secondary.

Suddenly here's this action-packed space adventure with robots, space ships, swords, chosen ones, ancient myths wise old men, bad guys in all black, good guys in all white, turn your brain off adventure.

545,10.0,"Star Wars. The theater was black except for the small light coming from the projector onto the big silver screen in front of a 7 year old boy. His eyes glued and wide in anticipation of a film that he knew very little about other than an adventure in space, a place where he always dreamt of escaping to. When the first note trumpeted out of the speakers for the first time, his heart pounded and his soul was free. This universe that George Lucas had captured and the young man, Luke Skywalker, was the embodiment of the dreamy eyed young 7 year old now watching, vicariously living in that universe. From that point on, I grew a little more hopeful for the future, that 7 year old's spirit still laughing, smiling and even crying inside, encouraging me to escape what I thought a terrifying life of abuse from peers and my own subjugating voice telling me I'd never be anything but a loser. This movie's storyline was inspiring to me as an artist, writer, actor and human being. The underlying religious connotations I've never considered religious overload, merely to believe in something bigger than oneself, an energy that encompasses everything, everyone. At this point at the end of 2015, almost 40 years after its release, I am still drawn into that flicker of light and that very first note, a glimpse into what can be, a piece of my own new hope.",1

547,10.0,"Writer & director George Lucas didn't invent science fiction as a film genre, but his landmark film ""Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope"" and its sequels and spin-offs certainly propelled science-fiction from the fringe to A-class productions. What made ""Star Wars"" so charismatic is the hokum that it embraces with such consummate love. Lucas has attributed his inspiration for the ""Star Wars"" franchise to his memories of Saturday matinée serial cliffhangers as well as his fascination with mythology. Mind you, nothing in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is remotely original except for its reliance on hoary clichés and conventions that fuel the 'space-as-an-adventure' formula with exotic worlds, lethal aliens, and ravishing damsels-in-distress. Basically, Luke Skywalker is another embodiment of ""Flash Gordon"" and Darth Vader is a riff on Ming the Merciless. Harrison Ford's Han Solo may be an outer space smuggler in a fast ship, but he resembles an old frontier western gunslinger for hire to the highest bidder. Alec Guinness is the older gunman/samurai warrior with a strange mind-set that enables him to control weaker minds. Robots and droids emerge as memorable characters, too. Surely, Darth Vader with his long flowing black robes, respirator breathing vocal deliver, and unmistakably Nazi-style helmet qualifies as one of the top twenty all-time evil villains. Lucas contrives weird aliens and animals and populates his film with a number of visually interesting settings. The Death Star as the ultimate weapon is really cool and presents the ultimate challenge to our heroes because they must destroy it. Essentially, the Death Star is comparable to the eponymous ""Guns of Navarone."" There is a lot of sophistication wrapped up in this seemingly superficial saga about a galactic rebellion against tyranny.",0

Star Wars is not a bad movie, but I do not believe this is at the level or Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal. It's just so average. You know, I can see why this has a fanbase, but this fanbase has hyped it to hell. The acting was adequate,the metaphors and subtext were so obvious it hurts, and the effects were meh. I cannot understand why people praise the visuals in this film as being landmark and revolutionary. 2001: A Space Odyssey, released 9 years before, has effects that look much better and hold up today. Star Wars looks 1977. Kubrick's masterpiece looks like it could be released any day. It's absolutely beautiful and timeless. Star Wars is just so annoyingly overrated. I don't hate it, I enjoyed it somewhat. But, I think I'll watch some Ingmar Bergman or Orson Welles to enjoy myself before considering giving Star Wars a rewatch.",1

I remember my father saying that he had gone to the movies to see Star Wars when it was first released in 1977 and he mentioned that he had fell asleep during the movie, then I thought how could you fall asleep on a movie like this ?  Not many people in my family cared much for Star Wars, but I have to say that it is one of the greatest film series ever made.  A New Hope is probaly my third favorite in the series, in which case The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite and Attack Of The Clones is my second and right after that comes A New Hope.  There isn't much to say about Star Wars except for that is a phenomenon and a timeless classic space opera which will be seen by people of all ages in generations to come.

557,10.0,When Star Wars came out in 1977 everybody predicted it was going to be a flop. Star Wars was supposed to be a 1976 Christmas movie but it had many technical problems which pushed the movie to be released to Summer of 1977. George Lucas was ready for the movie to fail so basically many of the heroes and villains had little backstory but George left little hints just in case. At the time sequels was still risky with only The Godfather and the Planet of the Apes to get sequels. Second 20 Century Fox was in deep financial trouble and only the president of the time Alan Ladd Jr. Had any faith in the movie. As for George Lucas he was not a great director although he did have American Graffiti as his major achievement.,0

Having just watched the whole series on Showcase this weekend, albeit with commercials on a 30 inch screen, I find the last three insufferable. Noisy commercial filler. I get frustrated with the young generation rating the originals poorly, that lower the IMBD overall rating. They have no ability to realize how life changing these were for a generation.

The only problem with this flick is that it doesn't really get going till they go to the bar where they meet Han.  Also, the light saber isn't used much in this one.  The only duel is between Obi-Wan and Vader and Obi-Wan throws the fight.  Other than that though it is a very solid movie.

563,10.0,"What can I say, really so many words and adjectives can be used to describe ""Star Wars"" that it's hard to find them all. Without a doubt this 1977 masterpiece from George Lucas which he done it by his own independent and rebel way clearly is one of the greatest films ever made. So many themes and elements are present mainly a tale of good against evil it comes down to light vs. dark. Plenty of mythology is present as Lucas shows by the different cultures of the film and that one must believe in higher powers to accomplish things. ""Star Wars"" has it's own civil war battle with the big focus on the rebels and the empire's fight over the galaxy with the Empire's greatest weapon being the mighty Death Star which is ruled by an iron fist with the cruel and powerful Darth Vader. Yet even though Jedi Knights are supposedly long gone, enter Luke Skywalker who's the film wild card who just as a simple farm boy wants and has bigger plans to be a Jedi and defeat the evil empire. Help is provided along the way for Skywalker by the beautiful Princess Leia, and droids C-3PO, and R2-D2(who sends the secret messages and signals) and most importantly the trust and experience of loyalty from Obi- Wan Kenobi. As the furry Chewbacca and cocky pilot Han Solo provide the transportation during this galaxy adventure. I must say also that the special effects and model crafted spaceships used in the film are superb many had never saw anything like it. Great job from George Lucas his direction of the scenes and sets is fabulous. Really what more can I say this movie is so special to me since it was one of the first I saw and being a little kid in the 70's it has a special place in my heart. Seeing this for the first time it was like my real cowboy movie, making me role play in my head and among friends the character of Luke Skywalker thinking he was real I wanted to be him! This epic saga also was the film that started to make me collect action figures, and truly believe in myself and see that the world was about good versus evil. ""Star Wars"" created a lasting impact on our times and culture a great tale of morality, faith, good versus evil, and it had all the genres of fantasy, adventure, escape, sci-fiction, and drama mixed together. Really one of my favorite movies of all-time, and always remember what it taught us all ""May the force be with you"".",1

The problem is that its legacy has created die-hard fans which have spawned the biggest franchise of all time; nothing wrong with that of course. But if you take a step back into modern day, you will see a film with all the elements a great fantasy epic should have (unimportant boy gets trained by old man, becomes great warrior etc) but a film where each element lacks the emotion to make you feel what you should. You don't feel sympathy when Luke's aunt and uncle die, you don't care about Kenobi's death because there was never an emotional stand-point that pinpointed him as a ""great man"". Everything simply happens without any given thought about the characters emotions. I could name a million films with all the same elements that have been done ten times better. That said, the originality is genuine, the whole story exciting and it's generally fun to watch. Just a shame its practically been ruined by its reputation as the greatest franchise ever.",1

Which i why i still and always will believe that George Lucas is THE worst director in cinema history. The story is interesting, but that's it, the sets are cheap, costumes are almost laughable. But yes, it can be enjoyed ever so slightly, the drama is quite convincing, as it's the acting which is to be applauded.

I am not a HUGE sci-fi fan but this film can appeal to every genre watcher in the world.

The ""special effects"" they used, the story, the characters, everything about it is the definition of timeless because it is as good now as it was more than three decades ago. The characters come to life, each and every one of them and the story leaves you riveted to every moment and throws this mysterious force of good against one of, if not thee, greatest villain in movie history.

591,9.0,"What can I say about this Sci-Fantasy film directed by George Lucas, that hasn't been said before? Everybody knows how magical, exciting, epic, and fun, this space adventure is. After all, it was directly influence by other older mythological stories like the Arthurian tales, classical Greco-Roman mythology, & old Sci-fi film serials like the 1936's 'Flash Gordon'. The movie even got influence from historical events like the foundation of religion beliefs, American westerns, Samurai Culture, and even World War 2 and Vietnam. Plus, I think, everybody know that the film follow the hero journey path laid out by mythologist Joseph Campbell's book, 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces'. So, what are some things, you might not heard of? Well, here's one. Did you know that Lucas had originally wanted to remake the 1930's Flash Gordon movie serials, but the rights were snapped up, so he choose to make his original Sci-fantasy movie, instead. The original story of the film was way different than the film that came out with lizard people, helmetless villains and older main characters. One big different is how long, it was. It had to be split up. The discarded first half was later used as prequels, although some have disputed this claims, saying that Lucas never mapped out the story at the time. Regardless of that, the half of the story Lucas was left with, was still too long, so it was split and rewritten into three parts with 1980 'Episode V: Empire Strike Back' and 1983's 'Episode VI: Return of the Jedi'. The first of this trilogy would be the film that Lucas would make, originally called 'Star Wars', now retitled in 1981 as 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. Anyways, both versions of the script had a plot where a royal is trying to deliver a device, through a ship in a last ditch attempt to rescue a planet, from being destroy by an evil empire. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the generic plot is a bit secondary. It's really not anything new, when you think, about it. After all, films serials like 1939 'Buck Rogers', had stories like that, every week/weekend. It's not perfect at all. There is ton of plot-holes in the film that doesn't make sense, mostly with the Death Star to be note, here. However, I'll let those things go, because it's supposed to be, a fun-corny unrealistic fantasy movie even if the movie has contrived coincidence moments. Yet, I can't let the mediocre acting in this film go pass. I really didn't like the farm boy turn Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)'s whinny little voice. I really wanted him to shut up, most of the film. Also, it's bit weird, how Princess Leia's (Carrie Fischer) weird British accent, comes in and out. Despite, the limited acting chops of the two main leads, they got better as the film series went on and their characters were very memorable. In my opinion, the supporting cast was probably better than the main cast. Harrison Ford as the scoundrel smuggler, Han Solo was a lot of fun. Much of the great humor of the film, comes from him. Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi was amazing! I love how Shakespearean, he was. He made me, believe in the force. Last, but not least, Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin was brilliant. His enthralling voice & his charming, yet evil manner was evil and menacing. The same goes with James Earl Jones voicing the character of Darth Vader. Still, I would love to see a version where 'Star Wars' try-out actors, Kurt Russell, Jodie Foster, Christopher Walken & Toshiro Mifune played these characters. Anyways, most people remember this film for its visuals special effect and action. Those were amazing, even if a bit dated. Another noticeable thing about Star Wars is the soundtrack by composter John Williams. His thematically rich score would give a heart to the action and usher in a new era of romantic old-style music in films. Even the sound effects like Wilheim scream were top of the line. Another thing, worth noting is the exotic locations. All of them, work, even if the production for this film was troublesome, due to weather issues. Another great thing about this film is the well-paced editing. For the most part, the original 1977 version, had really no slow parts. Yet, the 1997's Special Edition kinda ruins that, by adding fake-looking pointless scenes like Luke talking to his crewmates before the battle or Jabba the Hutt visiting Han Solo. While, a lot of the Special Edition edits, do help the film, by retouching outdated visual effects; it also kinda hurts the film. A good example is the 'Han Solo shot first' scene, which kinda betrayal his pirate-like character! While, this might sound controversy, I think the Special Editions were indeed somewhat needed. Updating old source materials is nothing wrong, as long as you keep the original films out-there, as well. After all, the special editions kept 'Star Wars' fresh on everybody mind in the mid-1990s & got me, into loving this film franchise. It's work for what it is; which is a Director Cut version. Some people might hate it; some people might love it. Nevertheless, it expose new audiences to the mythos of these films. Star Wars is one of those films that has become sewn into the very fabric of our popular culture. With the continued prominence of the Star Wars story through movie sequels, animated series, video games, and toys, I glad this movie went on, to great success in awards and money. The impact of the first film in the series was enormous - tremendous profits helped to generate funding for Lucas' state-of-the-art special effects factory known as Industrial Light and Magic, Lucas' sound company, THX & Lucas' American film and television production company, Lucasfilm. Overall: It was indeed a cinematic masterpiece. Every major movie blockbuster released today, has George Lucas to thank for. So go see it.",0

My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, ""What the heck,"" and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, ""May the Force Be With You."" ""Wonder what that means?"" I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, ""Star Wars"" transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. ""Star Wars"" took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love ""Star Wars?"")

To start off with the flaws of the film, I feel at times the story can be rather bloated. There is just so many ideas and so much going on here that its hard for the film to balance it all. It's characters however, are quite the opposite. Although they are very unique in presence and style (even how they are portrayed), I feel many of the main characters are rather thinly written to make way for the plot. Some moments are certainly very campy, and some can be very fun, but there are a handful where its just too ridiculous to take seriously. Besides all that, I still found the film to be enjoyable. Its slow paced nature and expansive worldbuilding makes for a sci-fi experience very few films have the chance to offer. Its sets are incredibly elaborate, as well as its makeup, special effects, and costumes- and the look of the film itself is incredibly unique and dazzling to look at. The film's score is excellent, and the actors do put their all in their respective roles. The flms standouts are largely, although not limited to: Anthony Guinness, Anthony Perkins, and of course Harrison Ford. In the end, Star Wars is a bonafide classic for a reason. There are few films that are able to be so boldly creatie from the get go, and even fewer that find its audience immediately.

637,8.0,"I have somewhere in the neighborhood of over 600 plus user reviews on IMDB, it seems silly that I have not commented on the original Star Wars trilogy yet. Better late than never, I suppose. But I will let those who read this be the judge. In my youth I was totally enamored with Star Wars. I went to see all the movies, I had the toys and even dressed up as Darth Vader for Halloween. I wasn't alone though, Star Wars was a huge phenomenon . It had mass appeal and became a huge part of American pop culture that would change the way movies were made by in large from that point on. George Lucas may have had a lot of influences, samurai films, westerns, Flash Gordon and Ray Harryhausen fantasy movies. But there was never anything like Star Wars before (or since, except other Star Wars movies). The 70's was an awesome time for movies, arguably the best time for American cinema with a lot of really gritty and uncompromising movies that were really well made and accepted, such as The Godfather and The French Connection. However, this was a time where movies were a lot slower and this intergalactic space adventure floored viewers with something totally different. While the film has some flaws and some pretty bad acting from Mark Hamill in particular at this time. George Lucas has to be given some serious credit for his creative vision and excellent storytelling. Visually, the film was way ahead of its time with groundbreaking special f/x and moves along quick with lots of pew pew lazer gun action. While I didn't like Luke Skywalker at all in this movie as he was kind of a weenie (and I couldn't stand Princess Leia either, but did she look good), Harrison Ford was at his best here with the introduction of cool antihero Han Solo. Alec Guinness however was fantastic as Obi Wan and along with Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader gave the film some class and excellent 1st class actiing. I can't say that I am as enthusiastic about Star Wars as I was when I was a youth, but I still enjoy it. My personal favorite is the next installment The Empire Strikes Back and whatever new Star Wars movie gets made, the original trilogy still holds up.

This seems to be George Lucas' vice: he always makes an average first movie. Episode I was relatively inferior, and Star Wars was fairly pedestrian in many ways. The re-issue was a fantastic film to watch to watch, which makes one wonder: What if Star Wars was released in the 1990s? Always an interesting question to ponder.

It has everything, the imagination, the fillmmaking, the adventure, ITS ALL HERE. Empire may be the better Star Wars movie for me, but Star Wars from 1977, not New Hope with George's updates, just Star Wars the theatrical film is perfect, and may possibly be my favorite of all time.",1

I grew up watching the original trilogy but ""Empire"" and ""RotJ"" were definitely the ones I gravitated to more. As I grew older, my appreciation for this film grew.

653,10.0,"Having never seen any of the Star Wars movies (don't kill me, I just wasn't that interested) and another entry coming out in December, I decided to marathon all six of them to prepare myself for the latest chapter. Starting out with the original movie, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm just hoping this isn't the best installment in the series. A New Hope focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. A farmhand named Luke Skywalker acquires droids that have the architectural plans for the Death Star. The Empire searches for the missing droids, and Luke agrees to help Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to get the plans to the Rebel Alliance and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyrannical rule. The only reason I was slightly disappointed by the movie was because the first 45 minutes or so were just plain boring. The initially slow-moving plot and cornball dialog didn't really impress me much. What kept me watching was the amazing set pieces and cinematography; it really made up for the flaws the beginning of the movie had. The last half of the movie, however, is incredibly entertaining, fun and action-packed. The climax especially was breathtaking and impossible to forget. The imaginative world also makes me excited to watch the rest of the series. There were quite a few flaws with the original Star Wars that disappointed me a bit, but once it gets going, A New Hope is an undeniably fun ride that I wish to take again.",1

Now when you look back (to this period) and with all of the latest dire sequels (and prequels), it's kind of hard to form a sound critique. The strength lies obviously with the ground breaking special effects but the cast and character were also super strong. The whole franchise has been blamed for the dumbing down of the Science-fiction genre (which it did for sure) but George Lucus was certainly a director, with a huge imagination and it's rather clever in parts. seeing it in the cinema, upon its release was just a jaw dropping experience!",1

Fox wanted The Other Side of Midnight to be their Jaws, in reference to the Universal movie directed by Spielberg that dethroned the Godfather and became the first blockbuster to make $200 million. Star Wars, on the other hand, took a different approach by opening in 32 theaters instead of 700 like Jaws. Once word of mouth spread, it expanded to more theaters and eventually displaced Jaws as the most successful movie of the decade. As for how it stands the test of time, it does. Despite many changes since its original theatrical release, the plot remains the same, and the characters with it. If t weren't for the advent of tv, star wars would've been not more widespread, which it is thrviing to this day.",0
664,1.0,"Frankly, I think ""Star wars"" is a great movie.  It was in a way the first of its kind and was very impressive.  However, I also believe that many people are turning this movie into one of the best of all-time for nothing. I don't remember having been hit by anything surprising except for the fact that everything was in space and that people lived in battle ships.  If you ask me, I think ""The return of the Jedi"" was the best of the trilogy (I don't include the one that came out recently since I haven't seen it). However, I won't deny the fact that there is an incredible lot of imagination contained in this classic and that one of the reasons I probably enjoyed ""The return of the Jedi"" the most is because of some of the questions that remain unanswered and are answered in the sequel or the third.  Some of the best scenes of the trilogy are in my opinion held in the first and if George Lucas hadn't invented the story that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, ""The Empire strikes back"" and ""The return of the Jedi"" probably would not have been as good as the are.  So all in all, ""Star wars"" is still the best of the trilogy and is a real must-see.",1

This film has elements from westerns, historical epics, Saturday morning serials and, due to the scenes with C3PO an R2D2, Laurel and Hardy films.  The main thing that makes this film a classic is the fact that, when it comes right down to it, this film is nothing more than a old fashioned fable that all ages can enjoy.

673,5.0,"The inspiration was the space opera serials of the '30s to the '50s and numerous other sources, with the result that this movie is almost startlingly unoriginal. The script was not great. The acting was achingly uneven, from the brilliance of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing to the awkward mouthings of Mark Hamill. The special effects were amazing only in their ubiquitousness; the techniques used were venerable -- and have been considerably ""spiced up"" in the currently available video editions. Yeah, it was lots of fun, but beyond that it had no meaning or enduring value. So what inspired the fanatic following enjoyed by the Star Wars franchise?",1
674,7.0,"I can imagine that the first Star Wars was impressive for its time, and how it managed to become instant pop culture icons is understandable. For its time. As someone looking back and watching this in 2015, it's certainly a good movie, but it has its laughable moments. The first scene, all the lasers conveniently miss their targets, there are some comedic death scenes (that were not intended to be so) and the aliens are obviously puppets - no ifs ands or buts about it. But despite these goofs in the film making (which you have to remember, this came out in 1977 - but I'm judging it from a 2015 standpoint), it's genuinely a good movie. The plot sets the precedent for the epic saga that will come afterwards. Original, iconic characters like Chewbaca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Jabba the Hutt are unforgettable. The ""childlike"" charm of Luke Skywalker and the interplay between the haughty and arrogant Han Solo, as well as as the bantering between droids C3PO and R2D2 give the film enough comedic relief to make a film about galactic civil war more ""down to earth."" Although I personally enjoyed Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi more, A New Hope is still good and one of the better films in the saga.",0

In 1977 when it was first released Star Wars was billed as a real science fiction movie that would top anything previously made. What we got was a fantasy void of any science that takes place in OUTER SPACE. People actually booed when Darth Vader appeared on the screen, not because he was the villain, but because of the realization that serious sci-fi was not going to happen here. I enjoyed the movie despite this but I'll never forget that sinking feeling in my gut when I realized here we go again another Walt Disney type movie complete with puppets and mystical heroes.",0

It was a simple idea of good over evil, rescuing the helpless, discovering adventure, mammoth technology and sword and sorcery. Luke was the boy we could all identify with. Ben Kenobi was the wise leader. Han Solo was the cool, quick-witted pirate. Chewie was the faithful sidekick. The droids were great comic relief. The princess was smart and strong. And those light sabers were so cool. The movie is timeless, transcending generations. More than 30 years later, it still works magic, wonder and awe with new generations all the time.

Set design, costume design and the like are superb; as of course are the effects, but it all rings a little hollow to me; maybe The Empire Strikes Back will prove a more satisfying film. The actors try their best, but the script isn't really centred around the creation of layered characters, although each of the main characters is defined well two-dimensionally. The only actor of truly great calibre in the film is Alec Guinness, wonderful in so many British films in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" in which he plays 8 parts and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Guinness is good, but simply not given the scope to show his talents to the full. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is reasonable, as is Carrie Fisher in an underwritten role as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is forgettable, overshadowed by Prowse/Earl Jones as Vader. The music is quite impressive. The film could have done with some better comedic touches; and with Alec Guinness this shouldn't have been difficult; that's a problem: Obi-Wan needed to be a more varied, ambiguous figure, in my view. While it should be mentioned this is a pretty wonderful film for children, it only rates as pretty good escapism otherwise. Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",1

I KNOW Han is gonna save the day, but every time I watch it I always wonder if Luke is gonna make it. Its truly a classic scene ranking with the best ever.

I believe that all true movie lovers should watch the original trilogy before daring to judge this cinematic colossus that has lived its mark in the history of movies.

There are so many sequences like the garbage disposal escape, the final battle and of course even the fight between Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader while dated by today's standards was at the time the greatest thing ever. Also I was surprised at the outcome, not ashamed to admit this. Here's where I get controversial, as much as I loved Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, this one was always my favorite. You just had to be there at the time and understand seeing this before the others and having your mind blown. I should point out I've watched this so many times, I even took my wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) to the rereleases in the 90s and it's one I've never reviewed because I don't know if film criticism is in fact criticism if it's fan boy gushing. Therefore I merely say I love this film, it's one of my favorites and I can't recommend it enough. It's too much fun, not to be a 4 star rating.",1
710,10.0,"Star Wars was that film that truly changed the world of Hollywood forever. Without it, I have no clue what movies Hollywood would be making today. George Lucas is a true visionary. Not only does it provide that excellent use of action and drama, but it features some of the most memorable characters to ever grace the big screen, excellent casting decisions, especially Harrison Ford as Han Solo, plus John Williams' score is incredibly awesome. Plus the visuals by Industrial Light and Magic, which was their first film, still hold up remarkably well for its time. With all these excellent things, Star Wars is the blockbuster in the most perfect form.",1

712,9.0,"Let's not kid ourselves about the impact of this film. Star Wars (1977), was a groundbreaking movie among the annuls of film history. It pretty much, launched the modern day film, which had been in a transition period, since, the mid-1960s, between the studio system era and the star system era. It helped establish the concept of the blockbuster film and opened the doors to multi-million dollar movie budgets. Along with Jaws (1975) and the Omen (1976), Star Wars (1977), also reinforced the idea of the profitable, summer movie season. The summer movie season is a staple of Hollywood movie distribution today. It also helped begin another Hollywood staple, by stating to the world, a movie doesn't have to stand on its own. It would be part of the establishment of the film franchise idea. A concept, which quickly began taking hold in the 1980s. Much like any movie, it had to get past the test of the box office, but as we all know, it had no problem. Star Wars (1977), would become the highest, grossing box office movie ever. It would hold the record for six years, until E. T: The Extraterrestrial (1982), after its successful finish in 1983, passed it. And, of course, the franchise idea was in consideration the whole time, because, remember, Star Wars (1977), is episode 4.",1

714,,"this is a pathetic film. for children unfortunately  watched by adults who refuse to grow up.  first off  it starts with the viewer  watching a battle in space. you start in the middle of a battle in which you dont know whats going on. you watch as  two robots  wonder around  a gun fire  and never get hit. the  ship is being seized by  an empire that is made up of the worst marksmen in history. this movie  is just a revemped version of the old knight in shining armor going to rescue his damsel in distress. unfurnatly the only one in distress is the viewer. then you are introduced to a boy named luke who gets chased around a desert by guys wearing  brown paper gowns called ""sand people"" who they them selves get chased off by an old man who make noises with his nostrils. he rescues luke  and  decides it is a great idea to go into space and take on the empire on their own.(he must have known how bad thier marksman skills were) they hire a smuggler and a walking carpet that never stops growling to take them into space.   do i have to say more. this is an insult to my intelegence. i recommend watching a good sci-fi flick like  Battlefield Earth,Dune or Waterworld",0
715,10.0,"This film is absolutely one of the best ones ever thought and made. One could try to describe its astounding special effects (especially those of the original version, but the additions, too), the unforgettable score by John Williams, the fantastic story by George Lucas (influenced both by Akira Kurosawa and by the ""Flash Gordon"" serials) or his direction (taking inspiration by World War II films and Spaghetti Westerns simultaneously). The film takes us to exotic planets and futuristic spacecraft, lets us experience the characters's emotions and successfully creates a whole Universe by itself (which is soon to be expanded by the various spin-off media, the merchandise and the two sequels).

719,9.0,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a wonderful feature. Acting is great, between spot on casting and largely convincing dialogue that delivers fulfilling character development. The emotional depth is also nicely crafted, although somewhat rushed early in the runtime, likely to move the plot forward into more intense moments. Despite this mistake and other plot holes, the story is still well written and largely intriguing for the audience. Comedy also thrives due to the chemistry the cast has. Visually the film excels, aided by a great score that promotes the adventurous yet also fear inducing tone created. The resolution is too quite satisfying, even if it feels slightly predictable. Overall, a truly great feature that began such a rightfully beloved saga.",1

When I was a child, I used to go to Disneyland with my family, and we enjoyed the Star Wars attraction very much. It was so much fun and really exciting. But I've never watched ""Star Wars"" series movie, so I picked this up today. To be honest, it was so disappointed. The ways the robot's action were awkward and clumsy. I think that people were just excited by the soundtrack in the 70s. That's all. This is a typical overrated movie. And I noticed Luke was wearing a Karate-gi but he didn't do Karate or Judo or something. Darth Vader behavior looks ridiculous and nasal breathing was so annoying. So for my childhood memory, I gave 2 stars, otherwise 1 star.",0

725,9.0,"There's no doubt that a large part of the appeal of 'Star Wars' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. However, the movie was also a classic battle of ""good versus evil"" with many religious undertones and spiritual themes. Many topics such as greed, temptation, and redemption are debated in the film and I've read that George Lucas admits that he injected religion into the 'Star Wars' films (see Time magazine, April 26, 1999).

726,9.0,"This is the stuff that makes for classic film-making! The film has it all - a great and simple story (which is really the Hero's Journey in play - Luke Skywalker our hero escapes his desolate existence to fight evil and rescue the Princess), properly paced editing (this film did a 180 from the classical style of editing where the pacing was slower and the editing less), a wonderful score by John Williams (who already outdone himself with Jaws in 1975), wholly original production design (lightsabers, the Death Star, X Wings, and of course Darth Vader!), and a sense of danger wherever our likable heroes turn. The best scene of this film is when Luke Skywalker looks at the twin suns of Tatooine longing for more than his dismal existence as a farmer. Don't we all feel that way some time? Don't we all long to do something extraordinary, to get that happy ending. I sure did and this filmed delivered - for this reason, I give this film a solid 9 out of 10.",1

When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it's up there on the screen.

730,9.0,"George Lucas created the Star Wars universe and wrote the script from this first movie over the course of two and a half years - and as Hollywood's second Golden Age featured great directors as Steven Spielberg, Francis Coppola, William Friedkin and Martin Scorsese coming through the surface, Lucas created a cosmic Western, writing with the spirit of ancient mythology. And the movie's timeless appeal lies in its easily identifying universe - whether it's R2-D2 delivering signature beeps, Darth Vader oozing through his mask and Harrison Ford dressed up as a space-pirate it's so iconic that cinema would never be the same again after this enormous hit in '77. And it's epic, fairy-tale nature is combined with memorable characters and enchanting thrills. STAR WARS is a movie as important as anything, and well - we all know that by now.",1

Star Wars is the best thing ever. It has better ideas and creativity than any other movie since. It couldn't be greater!

742,,Star Wars(1977) has been adored by audiences from its opening night in 1977 to its special edition release in 1997.  Star Wars is the film that changed the cinema and ushered in a new era of mega blockbuster features.  The only negative aspect is that Star Wars(1977) as with Jaws(1975) brought about the end of creative and risk taking filmmaking that was essential to films of the early 1970's(thus ending the last golden period in film history to date{1967-1977}).  This unfortunately brought upon an era of greed in which studios are more interested in piling in loads of cash then in creating bold and great works of film.,1
743,9.0,"Star Wars is big and grand not just to scale but to it's three-dimensional characters, interesting story, and it's impact to culture on a whole. Everyone knows about Star Wars and it's memorable cast of characters, like the young Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), the tough Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher), the scoundrel Han Solo(Harrison Ford), the wise old man Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Guinness), the hairy wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew), the two droids C-3PO(Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2(Kenny Baker), and lastly, the best of them all, Darth Vader(David Prowse). With such a large cast, they are they hit or miss? They, obviously, are a hit and every one of them gives such a performance people will remember them decades later. This movie was so great, that it's seventh cannon film, The Force Awakens(2015), had quite a few elements from the original which translated well now as it did then. Though, there are some inconsistencies I've notice particularly with the acting. One example is with Princess Leia where one moment she'd have a British accent, then it changes to another accent. Also sometimes Luke can have laughably awkward acting moments, that can almost be considered on the level on what George Lucas did later on with Anakin in the prequels. And, from time to time their are some lines that you might not remember, or stick to you; they can be presented not that great. But for a majority of it, there are several quotable and memorable lines in this film, though even more is found in it's superior sequel: The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Overall, this film is timeless and will always be remembered and watched by it's incredibly strong fan base. I give this movie a: 9.2/10=9/10 overall",1

After seeing The Phantom Menace though I realized what a real masterpiece of film making the original Star Wars has become in my eyes. The feelings I have for these characters is one of complete love and affection. You can't watch Star Wars and not care about the main characters in the film. When Obi-Wan sacrfices himself it is still gut wrenching and more effective than 45 minutes of The Phantom Menace. It is true when Star Wars hit the screen in 1977 it changed movies forever.

747,2.0,"How I used to admire the Star Wars saga back in the times that I have never really watched it! I totally agreed with the critics that it has opened a new era to the sci-fi films and is one of the best films ever made. Well, now that I have finished the film, I can say fairly that, Star Wars: A New Hope has visuals and ideas that surpass its age, but they do not compensate for the extremely weak storytelling and character design and basically everything else. And don't you tell me that it is a movie that ought to be viewed, not thought, and merely enjoyed; try to do the same and sit through the Transformers franchise and Suicide Squad. Three things stood out in this film: the special effects, the sound design, and the first act. Mainly three things stink about the movie: the plot, the character, and the theme. I do not really understand how they made those ships and razors, but they look authentic to me. The best shot of the movie in my opinion is a POV of the ship flying down the ditch at the military base in the end, though they've used it twice if I remember correctly. That shot is also extremely well done, and the special effects team behind this deserve a lot of acclaim. The sound design is also great. Together, these two aspects help create a world (universe) that feels real, which adds bonus points. And that's why I liked the first act best: it exploited the novel world(s), and the experience is simply immersive. Now let's talk about the bad things. Firstly, the plot is bad. This film was made in 1977, and films with a plot of saving the princess and then bombing all the bad guys are quite getting old don't you think? There are also so many times of the characters just standing in the rain of razor gun fire and not get a single hurt, yet all the bad guys seem to be extremely vulnerable and easy to get hit. Even the princess hits much better than a trained soldier. And then the characters are as simple as those in the Forbidden Planet. But even that film gets to have a great robot, and now in Star Wars we get to have two robots: one is a human in tin, and the other is a dog in plastic garbage can. Most characters do not develop, and the ones who do do it in the most cliché and uncreative way possible. Seriously, I just do not understand how this could ever go into the same class with films like Godfather or Citizen Kane. It is just plainly bad!",1

This was a groundbreaking achievement for it's time and it still is.

Also, there were shots of stormtroopers falling into a pit.

I left the theater in an overjoyed daze.  I saw this movie for the first time when I was seven years old.   I don't know if it would have had the same impact if I had first seen it at the age I am now.  But when I do view it now, more than 20 years later, the old feeling warms inside.",1
763,7.0,"Star Wars definitely didn't let me down, even if things have changed over the last 42 years of filmmaking. Honestly, it's pretty wild that this movie came out closer to movies like Citizen Kane than modern day, because the dialogue and visuals are quite clean and undoubtedly hold up as pleasing and entertaining. The characters and world building is all well introduced and pretty straightforward to follow, and the plot is coherent with a clear arc. While the visuals and commitment to a grand space opera series are notable, there are no crazy ideas in the movie, nor is it especially emotionally investing. Star Wars is a great movie because of its exceptional influence, present in almost all sci-fi media to follow as well as culture more broadly. It earns its celebrated status by working and being completely satisfying at a time when nothing like it had really been made. Is it unusually investing or an edge of your seat movie? No, but it's one filled with fun moments and groundbreaking visuals and effects.",1

769,10.0,"""Star Wars"" is the best movie that I've ever seen. It's been my favorite ever since I saw it when I was a kid. And it still is today. This is the ultimate sci-fi classic that takes place ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."" I love everything about ""Star Wars"". It has some of the most memorable characters for a motion picture. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), and my personal favorites: C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Kenny Baker) are characters in the grand tradition of great movies. I'll never forget these characters for as long as I live. The story is excellent, which focuses primarily on a young man (Luke Skywalker) who becomes an interplanetary hero with the help of a wise old man (Obi-Wan Kenobi), a beautiful princess (Princess Leia), a cocky spaceship pilot (Han Solo) along with his wookie sidekick (Chewbacca), and a pair of robot friends (C-3PO and R2D2) as they do outer space battle against a powerful force (and a powerful villain in Darth Vader). The action scenes and special effects are outstanding. This movie features some of the most astonishing special effects that I've ever seen. ""Star Wars"" broke new grounds in special effects technology when it was made back in the mid-1970s, and the effects got an advancement 20 years later when new footage turned up in the 1997 re-release of the film. The new special effects featured in the 20th anniversary ""special edition"" could not be done in the 1970s because the effects technology wasn't as advanced back then as it is now.",1
770,10.0,"Hollywood is rich in mismatched buddy acts, and none more so than the Laurel and Hardy of cybernetics, C-3PO and R2-D2: one short and stout, the other tall and, to all intents, 'English'. Being a protocol droid, or butler, and butlers being stereotypically British, it was probably inevitable that C-3PO should be camper than a rowe of tents. There's no getting around this. Threepio is quite, quite gay. And considering their odd relationship, R2 - the Swiss Army knife of droids - is fiercely loyal. R2 could mosey along fine without old Goldenrod, who usually depends on others, including his gutsier companion, to get him out of scrapes.",1

I was surprised by the great quality, story etc. The special effects rule (most are actually stop-motion done with a gigantic number of frames, but if you watch closely on Hoth in V you can see an AT-AT missing some frames) and the music by the legend John Williams is beyond anything.

782,,One of the most recognizable and iconic film series started way back in 1977. With its great visuals and music it has a solid story with bad pacing and some flaws to it.,1
783,10.0,"This movie broke new ground. It turned the industry - and audiences - topsy turvy. The acting was excellent. The story, a familiar line, was beautifully set out. But it was the special effects that put the movie over the top. They were a leap beyond all of its predecessors. The movie appealed to all ages and genders. You have to have been there to understand the effect when you saw it for the first time. Masses of people stood in line to see it over and over again with stars in the eyes. I was one of them. ""Starwars"" took what we always hoped was possible in a sci fib movie and made it a reality. It is no accident that it gave rise to five sequels (or prequels). Lucas deserves all the Kudos and dollars he got for this magnificent creation. It set a standard by which all future science fiction movies would be judged. All that for me makes it a 10.",1
784,1.0,"Star Wars is no ""masterpiece of synthesis"" or ""triumph of American ingenuity;"" it is a fraudulent copy of several good works of literature. Lucas steals the ideas of Frank Herbert in his work entitled Dune and plagiarizes even more off of unknown novel I cannot recall as it is so obscure, he felt no need to give it credit. I have heard arguments which claim that The Lord of the Rings is just as childish, but those arguments ignore the fact that The Lord of the Rings is a blatant and outright statement, a parallel to the horrors of the First World War. Additionally, the acting is phenomenal, the characters have depth, and the story has meaning. The authors of such arguments clearly view the battle scenes as similar to Star Wars, only having appeal because of the special effects. But things such as the gigantic war elephants actually represent something, whereas nothing is representative of anything in Star Wars. These elephants represent tanks, the new and deadly weapon that were finally used more frequently in war. I can overlook the discrepancies, such as the fact that the first time the Death Star was used it took but a few seconds to fire, but when the are attacking Yavin, they must maneuver around the planet to reach the moon, as there are such discrepancies in most movies. However I cannot ignore the lack of depth each of the characters has: Luke is like Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds--he is paid to whine, and whine, and scream, and whine. ""But Uncle Owen, I was going to go the Anchorhead Arcade, I don't want to work on the droids."" His character is painfully dull, and the actor, Mark Hamill, lacks any sort of talent. None of the characters are relatable, none of them have any complexity. They are all straightforward representations of archetypes, with no combinations of emotions--in fact, they seem like the have no emotions whatsoever. Everything is superficial--I enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture ten thousand times more than Star Wars, and The Motion Picture is one of the most painful movies I have ever watched. Watching Star Wars, I can picture each actor--if they may be so honored by such a title--with a script in front of their eyes. It seems they are only reading; a common acting saying goes, ""Show, don't tell,"" but I have never been told a more boring story. Besides the painful, shallow acting, the plot is poorly written. There are no twist or turns, no interesting facets or components which one does not expect to appear; everything is predictable, everything is as plain as can be. Star Wars is ""a masterpiece of synthesis:"" I don't think I have ever seen a movie so perfectly blend plagiarism, horrid acting, a lack of depth and emotion and complexities, and so many other despicable aspects. As for its ""ingenuity:"" well, if plagiarism and poor writing, acting, and characters constitute ingenuity, then this movie deserves a 10 out of 10--if not, Star Wars most definitely deserves nothing but scorn. Why so many have found this movie so enthralling I will never understand.",0

As a WW fan, it's also a guilty pleasure to see how much of Ben Kenobi/Jedi/The Force seems directly ripped off from W.M.Marston's Emotions of Normal People, like the Motor Self (Ben Kenobi) passively reinforcing itself through active compliance (accepting Vader's strike) and the ventriloque talk that put fear on the sand people.

With a sustainable balance between cowboy action, science fiction mythology, cock-sure humor and groundbreaking visuals, Star Wars delivered. Weeks after the films' opening, I remember standing in line for hours among the events' full demographic spectrum. Looking at the film 37 years later, I can see where my suspension of disbelief and fickle patience with directorial re-releases has taken over. It's as if the geek inside Lucas' mind needed reeling in. The aliens are silly and the dialog about ""womp rats"" remains ridiculous. But for all that is and has been said, my entertainment continues through our main characters, on their personal quests which seemingly will again re-unite for another episode hauled in by the Disney Machine and their power.

Sometimes when I'm feeling down, watching Star Wars is the only thing that can really cheer me up. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music!! John Williams has done a wonderful job on this movie as well as the other ones, in fact he won an Oscar for it. I don't know how George Lucas came out with something so perfect, but I'm glad he did. The acting was great, I think Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all time. In this particular film of the Star Wars trilogy I think that my favorite character is Han Solo, the cool tough guy whose best friend is a walking carpet. Alec Guiness plays wonderfully his part as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old Jedi master who trains Luke on Tatooine. In conclusion, I would like to say that this movie has changed the world and has opened my eyes to an incredible new universe. A galaxy far far away.....",1

No one knew what to expect, but it was really something. You can have your Empire or Jedi, or even Sith, but this for me is the best. It introduced us to a fictitious yet believable space opera set in a distant galaxy far from Earth and gave us a handful of memorable characters. What more could you ask for? It also combines elements from Flash Gordon, spaghetti westerns, mythology and samurai films. That combination makes for such a wonderful movie.

822,9.0,"Star Wars is a 1977 epic space opera and space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is possibly THE most important film of all time. Star Wars changed film forever, never before had a film become such an icon on not only the big screen but in our ways of life and society as a whole. Still to this day Star Wars merchandise dominates the shelves of stores and rules the world of pop culture. George Lucas introduces us to firstly to two droids, the mild-mannered C-3PO and his quirky companion R2-D2, before really introducing us to characters of Luke Skywalker (our hero), Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and possibly the most recognised and terrifying villain in cinematic history, Darth Vader. The beautiful sets and locations really sell the idea of otherworldly planets, while having a familiar feel our own home planet. Characters are well developed with many visiting places they never thought possible and having fully developed arc's from start to end. John Williams gives us at times heart-wrenching, powerful orchestrated scores to accompany the stunningly beautiful shots and mesmerising film making. With a movie as iconic and important as Star Wars it is hard to find flaws, whoever the small flaws with the film has are mainly with the special effects which today certain shots and effects don't hold up as well today, also to mention the slow-paced duel of two 'masters' in the latter half of the film doesn't sell the idea of a fight to the death and sometimes cheesy and clichéd character dialogue and situations. Overall, Star Wars is a fun-filled epic space adventure, with edge-of-the-seat action scenes, iconic characters, beautiful landscapes, ground-breaking and revolutionary cinematography accompanied with a masterfully composed soundtrack and scores throughout with not a dull moment in sight. 9/10",1
823,1.0,"This movie had it all for Common Joe Schmoe.  It had explosions, high tech special effects, plot twist, and even a comic book style story line.  I can see why so many like this film, it was made for the lowest common denominator.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the film was quite entertaining when I first saw it.  But it seems this film has become more than a entertaining movie with groundbreaking special effects.  To some this was an epiphany.  An enlightening experience.  I can see why an adolescent would find this to be such an experience, but an intelligent, mature person would take this film for what it was, entertaining and a visual treat as well as one of the better action/adventure films out there.",1

This highly imaginative story is one that almost anyone could find enjoyable. The weaving of action, adventure, drama, conflict, and a plethora of other genres and literary devices is absolutely remarkable. All of this encased in a theme of science fiction is a clear cut example that great writing is just that, great writing.

827,10.0,"Star Wars: the ultimate science fiction. The go to franchise. A New Hope is where it all started. George Lucas labeled his first outing as the fourth episode, holding the start of the story until a later date. For 22 years though, we're with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), a youngster keen on joining the Rebel alliance, teams up with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Guinness), a couple of droids (R2-D2 and C3PO) and rough outlaws (Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca) to save princess Leia (Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Empire and destroy their battle station, the Death Star. A New Hope is groundbreaking, both in genre and visual effects. It represents the forces of good vs. evil perfectly. Luke's the guy we all want to be, whilst the Sith Lord Darth Vader intimidates with voice, presence and action. Leia and Han show glints of romance that hints at more to come. ANH is an all round great film in a world that encompasses unlimited possibilities. It's more of a need to see than a want.",1

832,9.0,"Star Wars.... so simple a name, yet so appropriate, so meaningful, so attractive. This ultimate venture in imagination can not be, and should not be compared with any of other popular sci-fi movies. I don't believe there were any other movies before this where events took place totally outside earth or without its inhabitants. In that sense Lucas created an entirely new world of his own. Got a fine story, containing detailed descriptions of lifestyle, politics (these two things ordinary sci-fi ones lack) and of course, action. Creation of characters are excellent, as they never seemed impossible. As a director and writer, Lucas excels in many ways, such as in cinematography, plot-twist etc. But probably the best thing about this movie is its special effects. so perfect, they hardly seem possible in 1977! To tell the truth, this movie is probably the best in the whole saga, followed closely by ""Attack of the Clones"".",1

836,10.0,"Let me just start off by saying that I will always love the first Star Wars film. However, to watch it as an adult is a much different experience than watching it when I was 10. It's still a very entertaining film, however there are a few reasons why this first installment of the trilogy doesn't hold up for me. First, Lucas's direction bothers me just as it has in the new films. Some of the scene transitions are just sloppy. If this had been a first film, all would be forgiven, but he had already done THX1138 and American Graffiti, the latter being one of my favorites of the 70s. Second is something I never noticed until the last couple of viewings. The actors in the film seem either bored or are just not sure about the lines they were speaking. With the exception of the voices (James Earl Jones and Anthony Daniels) all of the acting is very flat. I know this is nitpicking because the special effects are incredible, it's just that I can't, out of all 5 films so far, think of one truly exceptional performance besides Harrison Ford in Empire. This review is not meant to pan this film which I view as a classic. I just wanted to share some criticisms.",0

It seems a shame that Sir Alec would be doomed to be remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi for the rest of his career, as it's hardly a good part.

The stuff they added was just a bunch of cheesy state of the art CGI images that just clutter up the scenery.  The 1977 original version is the only TRUE version.

844,3.0,"More than 30 years and probably 10 watchings (this time blu-ray) I can say - boy, what a crap! Even three stars are too much now. I know, being much younger and all in those times this movie was like ""end of the world"". I didn't notice incredible stupidity lines (yes, Sir Alec was right; see trivia), horrible (if any at all) acting and lame sfx (some of them were quite good, though - x wings for instance). Also, if you watch this movie now after first three parts, it's even worse. ""Old friends"" Obi Van and Anakin behave almost like they've never met before. Luke and Lea are twins like a kangaroo and a shark, and whatsoever have no resemblance with their parents Padme and Ani. In this ""fourth"" part technology is deteriorated beyond belief (nothing to do with sfx!), as the Star Wars universe went couple of hundreds of years backwards compared to the Revenge of the Sith (episode III). The casting is also lame but was probably good for that time (""hey, guys, who wants to star in a movie and probably get paid?""). I never thought much of Mr. Lucas as a director and this movie proudly proves it. Someone (not George Lucas!) should remake the second part of the trilogy, and patch all the holes (of which many are wider than the Solar system). Try to save what could be saved and make these movies proper and balanced sequels. Kids will always buy stuff like this. It will always be a cult and a favorite fairy tale.

It is the characters we remember: Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca. My favorite may be Obi-Wan.

865,8.0,"Strangely, 'A New Hope' was the first of the Star Wars saga to be released, despite being Episode 4. Cleverly following the Star Wars story: Rogue One, the film's title continues from Princess Leia's ending words from the last film, stating that 'the schematics will bring hope to the Rebellion'. The film is centred around the execution of the Rebellions plan to counteract the devastating Death Star and prevent it from causing further damage. The Galaxy is in a period of civil war to begin with. With the plans stolen from the Galactic Empire, they are situated with secret Rebellion leader Princess Leia, however, her starship is intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer under the command of the brutal Sith Lord Darth Vader. Leia, throughout the film, is presented as a tough character to break, her courage and integrity shines through her personality and there is no doubt she wears her heart on her sleeve. Played by Carrie Fisher, her Princess status is somewhat overlooked by her incredible guidance and leadership skills, at the heart of the Rebellion's fight against the Empire. Leia knows she is set to be captured and held hostage by the agent to the Empire, Vader and carefully places the schematics in the memory of the astromech droid R2-D2, who, along with protocol droid C-3PO, flees in an escape pod to the desert planet Tatooine. The droids are captured by tenacious Jawa traders, menacing small creatures with oversized cloaks to hide their image, only darkness and and two eyes can be seen. The traders sell the droids to moisture farmers, Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew Luke Skywalker. While cleaning the rather sandy R2, Luke accidentally triggers part of a holographic message from Leia, in which she requests help from Obi Wan Kenobi. The only Kenobi Luke knows of is 'Old Ben' an elderly hermit. He asks his uncle if he knows anything, but Owen steers the subject of the conversation in a different direction. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 missing, and while searching for him, encounters Old Ben. Ben reveals his true name to Luke as Obi Wan and tells young Skywalker of his days as a Jedi Knight, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who derived their power from an energy field called the Force, until they were wiped out by the Galactic Empire. Obi Wan appears of course much older, but his wisdom from the Force has not changed, he is the only character we see from an apprentice and Jedi trainee, to becoming a Jedi Knight and joining the Council, and still present post Republic. Luke is intrigued by Obi Wan's knowledge and is told by Ben that his father fought alongside Obi Wan as a Jedi Knight until Vader, a former pupil of Obi Wan's, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. There is no evident explanation to why Obi Wan didn't tell the truth to Luke, but can only be inferred that the wise Jedi didn't want to overwhelm Luke, and steer him away from becoming a Jedi himself. Obi Wan presents Luke with his father' old weapon, a lightsaber. R2 interferes and plays Leia's message to Obi Wan, in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Obi Wan invites Luke to accompany him to her homeworld and learn the ways of the Force, but Luke declines, saying his aunt and uncle need him. With little knowledge of the history of the Jedi and the Republic, Luke is obviously going to be conservative and curious about Obi Wan's stories. Leia of course was born into the Rebellion via her guardian, Senator Organa. Returning home, Luke finds that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle and destroyed their farm in search of the droids, leaving Luke no choice but to accept Obi Wan's invitation. The transition is nothing more than a sudden change of events, fortunate that Luke wasn't on the farm for the same to happen to him. They travel to a cantina in Mos Eisley, where they hire smuggler Han Solo to transport them. No different to his characterisation in the Star Wars story: 'Solo', Han is still as witty and smug as ever. The famous pilot, owner of the Millennium Falcon, is confronted by Greedo, a green faced Bounty Hunter working for a local mobster Jabba the Hutt, to who, Han owes money; the confrontation ends with Han shooting and killing Greedo, but the real question is who shot first? Obi-Wan, Luke, R2-D2 and C-3PO exit Tatooine, with Han and his sensitive Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca on their prestigious ship. The Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin orders the destruction of Alderaan, Leia's home planet, using the Death Star's super-laser as a show of force. The crew on the Falcon are iconic, known as the original characters of the saga; Luke - played by Mark Hammill - appears intelligent and comfortable in his position on the mission, intrigued to learn the ways of the Force, just like his father did. Obi Wan - performed by Alec Guinness, but only just as Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune was considered also for the role - provided the certain stability and gravitas as a character. Harrison a Ford mastered Han Solo - the confident, smooth pilot who's bravery ventures him into more than just driving a ship. The crew discover the planet's remains and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, which Obi Wan goes to disable. Luke, unaware of his separated sister, discovers that Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star and is scheduled to be executed, rescuing her with the help of Han and Chewy in a swashbuckling series of escapes. His task accomplished, Obi Wan sees that others need a distraction to board the Falcon, and in a terrific scene, he comes up against his former brother, a man he considered as a brother, who he chose not to kill himself on the Volcano in Mustafar, he sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader, knowing his choice will ultimately help the Rebellion, he is killed. The group depart the hangar but are caught up by four Imperial TIE fighter which they fight off. Using a tracking beacon placed on the Falcon, the Imperials follow the Rebels to the hidden base on Yavin 4. Leia's priceless schematics show that the Death Star might be destroyed by firing torpedoes into a two-metre-wide thermal exhaust port that directly leads into its reactor, triggering a chain reaction. Han collects a reward for his role in Leia's rescue, intending to leave and repay Jabba. Luke joins the Rebel squadron in desperate attack against the approaching Death Star. In the intense late stages of the watch, the Rebels suffer heavy losses in several unsuccessful runs during battle. Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Luke's X-Wing, but Han returns in a thrilling event, attacking the Imperial fighters, sending Vader spiralling into space. Guided by Obi Wan's spirit, Luke turns off his targeting computer and uses the force to guide the torpedoes into the exhaust port. The Death Star explodes just before it can fire on the Rebel base, killing Tarkin and Imperial troops on board. It is worth noting that Vader wasn't on board, after his failure to take down Luke's X-Wing whilst in his TIE fighter. In a trump jams ceremony at the base, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism. An excellent opener, and first taste of life in a Galaxy far far away... blessed with action, intense events and the introduction of prominent individuals. The schematics proving to be the key to the Rebellion's success. Episode 4 is truly a revival of the Rebellion, and signs of better times.",1

But the movie doesn't hold up now. If you look at the two sequels, they are much more entertaining. Somehow I find them soooo much better. At least they have some story and some character development. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is súch a superior movie to this one. I think the reason why this movie is being rated so high is because people remember how they experienced it as kids or teenagers. I'm sure they had quite a lot of fun when they first saw it, because the SFX were so good, and the story was simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is no longer entertaining today. I was bored silly when I first saw it a few years ago. Then I rented the sequels and found out they were much better. This movies had much more interesting stories and better dialogue. Maybe George Lucas is to blame. He certainly broke new ground when he made this movie, I got to give him that, but the superior sequels were directed and written by others (not many people know this).

The true heart of this epic saga is the character of Jek Porkins, the portly, ill-fated, X-wing pilot of Red Squadron. For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball. During his moment of technical weakness, Porkins was sucker blasted by enemy turbolaser fire and killed. There have been many jokes at the expense of Jek Porkins' honorable memory. For example, some have said that Jek's X-wing simply couldn't take the weight of his masculine frame, that it simply wasn't realistic. Well, how realistic is it for a Tusken Raider to leave a wimpy farmboy without a crushed skull when he has ...a skull crusher? How realistic is it for a princess to walk out of a giant garbage disposal with her white dress completely unstained? And don't even get me started about target shafts that are only two meters wide.",1
878,10.0,"Always in my top five, ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" is what sci-fi, action, and movies in general are all about. Even after two great sequels and three good prequels, this is still the best ""Star Wars"" film. I love the simple plot of this film that gets an entire saga going. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) needs help in her rebellion against the galactic empire and sends her droids R2-D2 and C-3P0 (probably the two best non-human characters in film history) to get Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to help her. Along the way, they become property of and friends of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Eventually they all meet up and begin their battle against the empire. I don't know if it's the greatness of the characters, the plot, or the visuals of this film that make it such a classic, but it is. I can't explain why, but it still tops all of the other ""Star Wars"" films for me. It's truly a perfect movie. The best film of 1977 (in my opinion) and one of the best films of all time. I doubt anyone reading this hasn't seen the film, but if you haven't, you're missing out on something wonderful.",1
879,,"I was 10 years old when Star Wars was released. I had the merchandise (pen, ruler, lunchbox, frisbee), I was smack in the middle of the target audience, all of my mates loved it.

880,8.0,"In a galaxy far far away, Lucasfilm started the star wars saga, with a great first movie, the movie does start off a little slow and I don't understand why they started with the fourth in a book series instead of the first movie, but other than that, I say this was a strong start for an amazing saga, and while it may not be quite up there with some other star wars movies, I still love it and I still will on rewatch.",1

And in this universe goods win all the time, like we always wanted. These are what you need to make an legendary movie and affect people. And also beginning of a huge franchise.

883,10.0,"This is the first film I saw as a kid. This film (as well as the two sequels and prequels) have been with me forever. I probably saw this when I got out of the hospital and put the tape into the VCR, yeah I was around when those were around. I think it should have won all of the Oscars it was nominated for. It losing Best Picture, Director and Screenplay to Woody Allen's Annie Hall, is just inexcusable. That film was boring, while this film is great, but that's just my opinion on Annie Hall. George Lucas was influenced by Serials like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon, as well as taking classic tales like a boy wanting to go on adventures meeting some interesting characters that eventually meet a wizard, that meet a couple of other interesting characters all to save a princess from the villains is all fairytale stuff, and George Lucas knows that. He even puts mythology and religion into the film, later in the Prequels he puts political stuff to show how things that were so good they collapsed and how someone gained the power they did. From the opening crawl, to the destruction of the Death Star, from seeing Luke meet C-3PO and R2-D2, to Luke getting his fathers Lightsaber and learning about the Force by Obi-Wan, to them meeting Han Solo and Chewbacca and all of them going to the Death Star and saving Princess Leia and Darth Vader killing Obi-Wan, to Luke destroying the Death Star and killing Grand Moff Tarkin, seeing the victory of the Rebels, this is a Masterpiece that deserves it's place in Film History.",1

888,1.0,So I was lent a copy of this on DVD it had been digitally remastered and there are parts of the film that make go nope those scenes made the film quite dumb especially when han solo meets jabba the hut and when I watched this film on a video that part wasn't In the movie I only remembered seeing Jabba the hut in return of the Jedi and there's other parts when c-3p0 is in the desert and he's standing on a sand dune talking to r2d2 and in the background there's a big skeleton of who knows what? Basically I would just stick to the original as the remastered versions seem to have characters that weren't in the original movies - so can be confusing to know what there in the film for in the first place!!!,0
889,8.0,"What is impressive about Lucas' first big budget movie is the sheer enthusiasm and vision of its filmmaker - a mix of crazy characters, practical effects, Japanese-inspired costumes and a villain whose very name would become iconic.

890,8.0,"There are several ways to look at this film. One is ""I'm 40 years old"" and it reminds me of my youth, the days before all the super crazy CGI and all the rip offs of this film and can remember a time when there was really nothing great out then as far as Sci-Fi was concerned (just look at Logan's Run today). The other is ""I'm 20 years old"" and have no conception of the history of film making and have to give SW a one star rating because the effects are old or I'm just jealous that my generation does not have a film event like this and probably never will. Younger people need to realize that in 1977 there were no computers, video stores, big screen TV's, DVD's or bluray. Heck there was barely video games (were talking Pong) or VCR's and cable TV was in it's infancy. This is why kids went to see it multiple times because in 1977 movies were the big thing and we had few other ways of feeding our need for cool stuff like SW. That and the fact that the film created a new very believable world that was a great escape from the bad taste of Watergate and Vietnam, both of which were still very much in the news.",1
891,8.0,"George Lucas' Star Wars is a wonderfully produced film about a boy that wants to find his place in the universe and is placed in life-changing situations. George Lucas' imagination comes to life in Star Wars.  A simple yet meaningful story is combined with the futuristic vision of George Lucas along with special effects way ahead of it's time.  Along with Episode V and VI, the Luke Skywalker trilogy of Star Wars is a satisfying movie experience. For me personally, I think this is a beautiful movie that gives us many essentials in quality film making.  A story with necessary elements (a ""coming-of-age"" film), breathtaking scenery, a capable cast and an inspired director.  A great film overall. Of course, a movie can not be without it's flaws (No matter how much we want it to be perfect, it isn't).  I myself didn't feel much of an impact while watching this movie.  The story wasn't relevant to what I believed in and the special effects and robots' dialogue do take away from the overall impact of the film.  The dialogue was a little weird but I guess that was expected due to the futuristic nature of the film's setting.  Overall, the film's slight flaws that I've pointed out can not take away from the greatness of the film and to some people, may give opposite reactions that I've had. To the people that seem to hate everything they see in this movie, I say keep an open mind and enjoy.",1

893,10.0,Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger,1
894,9.0,"Star Wars A New Hope is a film that is really hard to review, how am I going to say anything new? How am I going to give my own spin on this film? Well I don't know but I'm going to give it a try. Considering that this film came out the The 1970s I really cannot praise the Ambition of George Lucas enough, he created an entire world in this movie, a world that has been explored ever since the release of this film and the exposition feels natural and done to make the universe seem lived in. The special effects of this film still hold up to this day Most likely due to Lucas' decision to use practical models over full blown images created entirely through digital means. While this film is undeniably incredibly entertaining one of the greatest praises I can give this film is its complete reliance on its characters. This film has its characters all in interesting places and the screenplay all gives them compelling arcs and interaction and makes this film even more worth watching. While the main characters were done extremely well so too were the villains particularly this film (and the trilogy's) main antagonist, Darth Vader. While in this film exclusively we don't learn so much about him as a person he just has this presence to him every time he is on screen, he's a very imposing villain and this film clearly set the standard for how to build a compelling antagonist. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that it didn't feel the need to give all the answers, it left certain things open ended in order to make the sequels more compelling and it was not done in a shameless way to simply profit out of it but for a story telling device that paid off in masterful form. The spaces sequences in this film are jaw dropping, like I said he special effects are seamless but the pure tension and believably of it all makes the final battle of this film much more entertaining and gives us an impression of real stakes. My one and only gripe with this film is certain points where the film slows down needlessly and sometimes just to provide exposition that was purely not required. ",1

He wrote and Directed him self, I love this film to death! I love everything that is in A New Hope. Before I go in to this movie I want to say after watching the new awful horrible movie Episode VII The Force Awakens, I decide to re watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and I have always loved A New Hope and I always will.

898,10.0,"They want you to believe they loved it upon initial release but they did not. Official critics want you to go by their recommendations so they can't reveal the reality that they hardly ever agree with the masses. If so, they would have given Bridgerton emmys for the actors and the best series. More often than not, if a show or movie is immensely popular, right out the gate, in organic fashion, without Hollywood hype, it never wins the best picture award or best actor and actress award or both, along with best director. And certainly never a sweep of those awards. Star Wars got no hype. It was low budget for its time. I remember a collage of seemingly incomplete scenes and no reveal of the big bang moments. George knew how to keep its essence, a secret. Word of mouth on the street, alone, blew this episode 4 movie up. But if you look at the latest reviews, people born 30 or more years later would think the Hollywood critics got it right. But it's revisionist critic history. I was there in 1977 and I purposely read the reviews after I first saw the movie. The Sound of Music MAY be the only movie where critics and audiences agreed. Unfortunately, I was too young to be sure. That movie felt organic, too. But I have yet to see a word of mouth organic hit that feels like the audience reaction to Episode 4, sweep the awards that are usually given at the end of a broadcast.",1
899,10.0,"The movie is spectacular but the official critics lie about how the film was initially received by them. I was there in 1977 when critics panned the movie and did not take it seriously. Naturally, the establishment revised their overall recollection after it became a blockbuster. Also, naturally, the establishment did not revise what black people thought of the movie, if, indeed, blacks were in high profile critics circles at the time. According to wiki, which is controlled, blacks did not like that Vader was voiced by a black man and dressed in black. The establishment only revises the critic history of the non black critics that were in the premium positions. It is known, who they are. Audiences of all races seemed to enjoy the movie. Establishment critics never want to admit that they don't know the future and don't always get it right, when reviewing a movie. More often, than not, they get it wrong. With few exceptions, they got this one wrong, upon initial release.",1

Everything in my life, and everything in any movie-lovers life, whether or not you are a Star Wars fan. This movie showed people a whole new potential that movies could actually have, by leading sci-fi into a direction never before seen. Movies after 1977 have never been the same, the vision of George Lucas was the start of it all This is with the result that pretty much every scene is iconic at this point. Movies are a subjective thing, and if star wars isn't your thing, then fair enough, but give this a watch before saying no to star wars. You can easily watch this without being a hardcore star wars fan, and still enjoy this movie alot! This movie is my favorite of all the sw movies (even though Empire in many ways is objectively better), and it pretty much defines my childhood. This movie is beautifull. If you're a parent, then do your child (not to mention yourself) a favor, and watch this movie with them.",1

The story was superb, the actors were all great in their roles, especially Harrison Ford who excels in his role as Han Solo. R2D2, C3PO and Chewbacca were all wonderful creations, and the special effects were amazing considering this film was made in 1977. The most amazing thing is the follow up The Empire Strikes back was even better! This film deserved the astounding success it gained ***9/10***",1

There is a reason for this, the series was quality entertainment and still holds up to this day.

The droids are them captured by Jawas and sold to moisture farmers ( The Lars and their ""nephew"" Luke Skywalker). Luke discovers a message in the droid and that takes him to old Jedi Knight, Obi Wan Kenobi. Obi Wan tells him that they must deliver the message to the Alderan system and before they know it, the Imperials are on their tracks and destroy Luke's home, which makes him go off on his great adventure and desire to become a Jedi Knight. They meet Han Solo and Chewbacca and need them to take them to Alderan. Darth Vader is one of the greatest villains of all time and the creatures in this flick are very memorable.

The cast fits the characters so well, Peter Cushing was never more chilling than as the Evil Grand Moff Tarkin. with his menacing glances and his Bull dog, Vader he keeps the outer rim sector in his tight grasp.Harrison Ford gave us an anti hero a la bogart and created an icon for young boys everywhere. Alec Guiness . like the force, binds the film together, emotionally and in terms of the plot. a great actor in a great role. Carrie Fisher gave the girls someone to look up to, a pretty but gutsy heroine quite capable of handling herself ( and a blaster!) its impossible to sum up in this paragraph the films allure, mystque and staying power ,so lets just sit back relax and let Mr. Lucas take us back along time ago to a galaxy far, far, away....",1

Simply put, Star Wars is a masterpiece, made with meticulous attention to detail by a reclusive but highly knowledgeable film maker known for experimenting.  Star Wars speaks to the child in all of us, that naive spirit of adventure, of Good versus Evil, that pure idealism that surrounds us with feelings of awe and wonder.  It's a great work of imagination, of tribute to the classics of the past, of legends, heroes, magic and wide open fantasy.

That movie, retroactively titled A New Hope, came from the mind of George Lucas and penetrated straight into the public consciousness like a bolt from the blue. A New Hope is one of the handful of movies to attain cinematic immortality. George Lucas' timeless myth exists on a plane that few movies can ever reach, as a kind of magical accident. You can't intellectualize why Star Wars works like it does, although many, many, many people have tried. It's George Lucas' disparate tastes and goals that shape A New Hope into something utterly unique in Hollywood. Westerns, samurai movies, science fiction B-pictures, and classical mythologies are the raw ingredients to Star Wars.

It's not that it's a bad movie, quite the contrary, it is a great film, and it should be, the film maker borrowed ideas from about 50 different SF writers. Anyway, there is some very good visual work based on some very good conceptual SF artwork. Personally, I never liked the sound the Wookie kept making in the film-I think since it was done about 50 times, and I didn't care much for CV3PO and I thought R2D2 needed some work to be more than just a talking garbage can, just like Hewy and Dewy from Bruce Dern's SF film Silent Running made in the early 1970s-yet another appropriation, that time from an earlier American SF film no less. If I was George Lucas I would feel a very embarrassed to have used so much of other peoples work to complete a 'masterpiece.'Not recognized to have spawned mediocre television SF show Battlestar Galactica in 1978-despite the repetition of key word 'Battlestar'. I guess one rip off deserved another.

There is insufficient plot to fill out the amount of time you have to sit, and the special effects look like they were made more than 20 years ago. At its time this was a very good movie.

When Obie Wankanobe loses, it is supposed to be some sort of holy moment. .I really didn't care..

The special effects aren't that impressive (simple mat-shots done on black-screen with inanimate objects) even by 70s standards (Superman's were far superior as they required matting a moving person).  The story is practically plaguiarized from Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"".  The characters play like a cheesy soap opera, with bad dialogue to match.  The only person in the film with onscreen charisma is Harrison Ford (which explains the directions of careers after the SW films).  The fascination that ""Warmongers"" have had with this series of movies (this one, in particular)is beyond my meager understanding: It's obvious to anyone who isn't a sick freak obsessed with these movies that Lucas & co. made it all up as they went along (no epic master plotline as many mongers wish to believe--Lucas was on a journey with no destination), which left them with each successive production to try and write their way out of the box they'd previously written themselves into (luke i am your father-but you killed my father-only in a manner of speaking--what nonsense is that?).Sorry, gang.

Surely the Death Star could've just blown up the rebel base without waiting for it to come in range. Hell they could've blown up the red planet first if it was in the way. Even if they were overconfident and didn't believe the rebels posed a threat to them, the rebels could've all gotten into spaceships and fled the base since the Death Star gave them plenty of time to get away",1

Many films have copied the plot used in Star Wars, but none of the copiers have made a better plot.

I wasn't yet alive when this film was released, and I only began to learn of Lucas' legend when Return of the Jedi, but that was enough to get hooked. Star Wars was and is a marvel of movie creation.  It lambasted its way into an era of hi-tech special effects, big budgets, and simplistic storytelling. Some call it the death of cinema, but I call it the re-birth of the matinee.  People easily forget what movies are and supposed to be.  Not moral messages or poignant take on society.  A movie is a chance, an attempt to get away from the pains and pangs of normal life.  Star Wars succeeds in every way.  I was fortunate to see the Special Edition of this film last year, and was pleasantly surprised that none of Lucas' touch-ups took away from the overall magical quality of the movie.  Were they needed?  Of course, not, but they did not detract.  I saw young children who have never heard of a Wookiee come alive again, with giant smiles and sparks in their eyes.

The success of the movie and franchise is now legendary as this launched the whole genre into one in which there was finally serious money being thrown at it after years of being subject to B movies with laughable affects. The special affect at the time were awe inspiring as they set a new bar for quality (even though they remade many with CA in future releases). For the era it was the thing for which it won awards, and specials were made on how they achieved such great special affects. By today's standards the original may be laughable, but the role the movie played in causing the genre to go main stream is what makes it stand apart as a part of movie history. Soon we had Alien and a series of high budget, good script science fiction to watch (along with those taking advantage of the new popularity). I remember thinking after The Empire Strikes back that this brought hope to my dream that someday they would make a series of movies that did justice to The Lord of The Rings.

The story is not original, it's a composite of every fantasy adventure written but it makes for a dazzling spectacle. John Williams, the man who made Jaws the tension filled thriller it is, scores a dramatic, fan fare opening. It's as if he knows how important this film is. I have to love it.

The only things I liked about this movie is the fact that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away, which is obviously an original setting for a sf movie, the technically imaginative Death Star, the well chosen cast, Harrison Ford's intriguing character, the Darth Vader costume and mask, the arrival of the light sabers, the plot and the movie's mythology. My rating for the movie: 6.0/10",0
1000,9.0,"Although I saw it once when I was a child, I didn't remember the plot. This time, I was touched by lucas's background settings (compared to what I thought the trilogy was mediocre) and by the plot, music, special effects, and the last gold-medal scene almost made me cry.",0
1001,9.0,"I suspect, given the billions of words already written on the subject, that there's nothing new for me to say about Star Wars. As a kid I watched this film so often (on our old Betamax video) that, like everyone, I could quote the whole script, word perfect. I have literally seen this film hundreds of times, and still get goosebumps when Luke switches off his targeting computer. I watched it again in honour of the 30th anniversary (the original theatrical cut on DVD, with, importantly, Greedo not getting a shot off!) and it was, as ever, great entertainment. Best film ever? No (for myriad reasons). Favourite film ever? Unquestionably!",1
1002,,"(Cue Star Wars Theme) Where to begin? This is not only one of the best movies of all time, not only (still) one of the most visual films ever made, but this is the movie that drew me back to the movie theater. The acting is strong, the script is somewhat weak but still good, and the effects are just plain AWESOME. Every generation needs to see this and The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Star Wars.",1
1003,3.0,"The special effects don't look nearly as impressive, or hold up as well, as those in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The story is nothing more than a bad Western set in space.  The acting is suspect and the dialogue is hokey. Get over it, it's not that good a movie, especially not deserving of #3 in the IMDB rankings.",0
1004,1.0,"Am, this is a real hopeless movie. It's like this kiddish tale of this big bully takes the precious queen and the little man must guide his fate. Worst special effects yet I don't blame the time it was made in, the worst story, it could have told how the rebels and empire started, disagreement? politics? just couldn't get along with each other? Hopeless, the story is 2 minute essay in the beginning, in a galxy far, far away. Even when I was in year 4 I can think of better story than this hopeless show. I'd prefer other shows and movies like Star Trek or Babylon 5, Star Wars is so hopeless I like Lost In Space better.",0
1005,7.0,"despite being a fan when i was young - say eight years old - with hindsight i feel free to rubbish this camp, unoriginal film. the script is weak in the extreme, something that doesn't change in this series. however, this one lacks what all the others have - a budget. alec guiness was good in everything but here he is effortless, and it's clear to see he didn't think much of this film. ditto peter cushing. try some good sci-fi like 2001, bladerunner, Alien. This is just a basic kid's story about good vs. evil, with a princess, etc. some good moments - the death star, the desert, but too few to warrant such hype. also, why do all star wars fans slate the new ones, which are infinitely better? Put this on if you're baby-sitting.",0

Not enough can be said about this film, it's timing or it's undeniable brilliance. Star Wars is simply enchanting from the opening crawl, its mythology is so profound and universal, it has etched itself in both our minds and our hearts. From its warm, cordial and unforgettable characters like Obi Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, its maniacal and ruthless villains like Darth Vader. Not to mention the action, the special effects, the fantastic score (By John Williams) and general ""feel good"" moments throughout the duration, this movie really makes me smile.",1
1008,10.0,"Star Wars is filled with so much imagination. It is a child's fantasy of monsters and ghouls as well as princesses and knights. The characters are impressive from the Black Dark Knight, Darth Vader to the bear yelling Furry Chewbacca. It is a ride in space. The film lifts you along as if a long time ago this did happen.",1
1009,8.0,"So much for Princess Leia being entrapped by the Imperial Senate as well as the dreaded sith known as Vader.

War is always entertaining and war in space, with the grand glorious backdrop of infinite stars can only be spectacular. It was so profound an experience for my adolescent mind in 1977 that I wanted it to be real. I wanted to live in this majestic universe of black and white choices and absolute power. I am still recovering from the profound impression it had on me, 33 years ago. Arrested development is an understatement.",1

Nearly everything about this movie is great. I think that anybody can enjoy this movie. I give this movie such high praise. This movie isn't my favorite Star Wars movie, but it is close. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen this movie probably 75 times in my life and it never gets old. This movie is a masterpiece. All of the characters are great from Luke Skywalker to Han Solo to Leia to Darth Vader to Grand Moff Tarkin to Chewbacca to Wedge Antilles to Ben Kenobi and so on. I love this movie.",1

1018,10.0,"Star Wars is a masterpiece. No science-fiction movie(except for its own sequel, The Empire Strikes Back) has the power of Star Wars. It is well written, funny, action-packed, intelligent,well... it is everything! Name a quality, Star Wars probably has it. It features the legendary special effects that this serie is well known for... but it has more(unlike the disappointing Phantom Menace). It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies). In fact, why am I talking to you about this movie? You have almost certainly seen it(probably a couple of times) and if you don't agree with me, you probably don't care about my opinion. ",1
1019,10.0,"Star Wars is totally genius. Very few movies have as many infamous shots, lines, and scenes (the godfather is the only one I can think of).

We are far out in the future as Darth Vader and his army are on the loose. The young farmer Luke Skywalker and his friends are up against the Empire on the Death Star as Luke Skykwalker and Princess Leia is watching their nearest one dies while Han Solo is on the run and more.

1021,7.0,"Some may not know that the galaxy containing the solar system that houses our beautiful little planet Earth is but one of so many it can, so to say, blow one's mind. Nobody knows if there are highly developed life forms out there in the Universe, let alone other civilizations. Outer space deals with distances that are hard to imagine, let alone conquer. ""Star Wars"" is set in outer space, but our Earth is nowhere to be seen. That's because this movie takes place in a whole different galaxy, a fictional one, of course. Despite dealing with technology beyond imagination, though, the story is not from a future yet to come. It is from the past. ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" is how the movie itself describes it. The technological wonders seen in the film might seem to contradict the ""a long time ago"" idea, of course. But they don't, because, for example, and let this be an easy example, our Sun used to be brighter and hotter, and our planet was uninhabitable back then. But Mars could have been in a whole different situation because it is further from our Sun. That means the red planet was once in a better set of circumstances, a milder one. Now think of those countless other galaxies, their own solar systems and, in turn, sets of planets. Nobody knows what is out there, or was out there.",1
1022,8.0,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I am extremely impressed by special effects especially for its time (1977). I find it way betterthan the new ones(1,2,3). I have to say that my favourite part is whenHan Solo's plane goes into hyper speed because they are trying to go tothe death star to save Leia. That was a really awesome part for me. Thefirst time I saw the movie, I was like WOW! what an incredible movie! I enjoyed every single part of the movie, it wasn't boring for me for onebit. Star Wars: A New Hope has got to be the top 10 movies of the 70's.I recommend if you like this movie, go see the two other old ones. I rate this movie an 8 out of 10.",1

I grew up with these films when I was young, building my childhood full of memories of wookies, stormtroopers, and fighting my younger brother with wrapping paper tubes to create our own lightsaber fights. This film is nothing less than a cinematic triumph with scenes, characters, and music that have practically revolutionized the way we look at the movies. Who on this good earth doesn't feel a rush of excitement to see that Star Wars logo on screen which sweeps into the distance with that oh so hummable theme?",0

This movie is everything you would ever want and more. Sit back as you watch Darth Vader Throw Rebel scum who won't reveal the secret plans to Luke gaining his lightsaber for the first time. There is nothing but classic scenes in this movie, rolling across the screen as they role into heart. Laugh as you sit there pondering who truly shot first and why the stormtrooper hit his head on the way into the room. Get lost in the vastness of space as you find yourself repeating famous words like, ""that's no moon.

1029,8.0,"Star Wars is kind of overrated, but that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. This film changed cinema as we know it today. It changed many things: Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing, Action and just Fiction. What it didn't revolutionise was acting or directing. Aside from Alec Guinness' great performance and good ones from Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, the acting in this picture is a touch stilted. Mark Hamill is winy as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford is always complaining and Carrie Fisher seems to go in and out of a bad British accent. They're not bad by any means, they're just not good either. Now that we got the bad stuff out of the way, I can praise the rest.",0

There is a common problem for some peoples who dont know how to watch films. Even though you are living 2000s this film shooted at 1970. So you have to assume that you are living in 70s.

If I had to pick which movie trilogy that truly introduced me to cinema it would be the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.(Granted it was the ""Special Editions"" I grew up watching in the 90s but I think that the theatrical cuts are better because it shows all the hard work they did without CG.)

I'm not saying that it is a bad film, I love this one... but it isn't one of my top movies. You don't have to put faith on my review, because I'm a fan of the b-movies... ""Evil Dead"" and stuff like that... But I've always been a cinema lover, and I see all kind of movies. Now, I can accept a good movie of his genre when I see it (most of the people doesn't), and this is one (and a good film in general).

The story isn't anything special, the acting is rubbish.  It's special effects are amazing, but maybe this just signalled the start of films being purely driven by special effects, which is certainly a bad thing(in my opinion).  I really love this film, it is fun, and i love it mainly because I watched it so many times as a child.  But If I saw it now for the first time, I would think it was rubbish.  It's a kids film",1

I squirmed every time he gave a line - he ruins the entire film. The only redeeming factor is Harrison Ford who knows he's making a kids movie and manages to save face. Hell, even Chewbacca puts in a good performance. Another irritating aspect of this movie is those damn droids - if Lucas was taking the mickey out of the audience then he succeeded. Enough said about them the better. Dialogue is another aspect that really highlights the problems with Star Wars - at times you think Lucas is really making strides then bam - another 'Power convertors' line pops up.",0

Episode II was great in some scenes; the ending is awesome. But it had a poorly illustrated love affair which detracted a lot from the film. Not really George Lucas's area. Oh well, he did fantastic with the first three. Episode III was kind of depressing, good action scenes though. If you are reading this and have not seen this great movie what are you waiting for?!

OK we will get the bad out of the way with first because I do have some compliments to throw this movies way. As said the special effects are garbage, for example in the trash compactor scene the eye of the alien briefly pops up and it clearly looks like a badly made puppet. If we all complain about CGI because it is unconvincing then why can I not complain about unconvincing practical effects? The action is also garbage. Seriously in the very first few scenes of the movie there are Storm Troopers coming a very small doorway, the rebels should have massacred them, but instead the opposite happens. Do I even need to mention how rubbish the light saber fight between Obi- Wan and Vader was? Do not give me any rubbish about production delay's, production of a film is irrelevant to critiquing a film. I have to really stretch my suspension of disbelief to believe the sequence of event's. Do the imperials at the beginning just forget droids exist? Can they not scan for droids? Why can they not just board up the pipe on the outside of the Death Star? Why did the Laser Luke fired bend with the pipe?. Loads of plot conveniences. By the way they never inform of the Empire's ideology, philosophy or motivation. Seriously the bad side of the force is literally called the dark side? that is really on the nose. Alright now for the good. The acting was good, the writing for the dialogue was good, the characters were great, the cinematography was great, it had a good concept (shoddy execution though) and it never really bored me. No I do not see being an industry influence for other Science fiction films as a positive. The influences of a film are irrelevant to critiquing a film.

No wonder so many people don't have trouble with the Iraq War (or any other) for that matter-they get their ideas on war from 'Star Wars'-from Hollywood, ne'er a battered or bloodied body in sight and no impact beyond the tediousness of the good vs. evil battle. The special effects are unsophisticated, the acting non-existent. A formula movie made with the absolute minimum of skill. This is a movie that's success speaks like no other about money, advertising,media saturation and POWER. And a small aside to the adults, acting like kids still praising this rubbish-GROW UP",0
1066,,"Everything about this movie is great. The effects just blow you away. This has a terrific script and HAS a plot. A really good one too. The action sequences are really clever and really action packed. The acting isn't really top notch, but what sci-fi is? It's probably the most liked movie in the history of movies. The new Special Editions are a great added feature. The end is the best in movie climaxes and ther's a lot to like about this blockbuster. I personaly like blockbusters. So this was definitely a great one for me. You won't be disapointed. Go see it right now, if you haven't but almost everyone has. The other thing that makes this movie stand out is its great sequels. Never have sequels looked so good compared to the original. This movie's got to be the best, but you already knew that, right?",1
1067,10.0,"What more is there to say...... ""It's Star Wars""........ it was the greatest film ever made.",1
1068,8.0,There is a reason why people even over 40 years later still talks about this movie and that is because it is so good. This movie would spawn the largest film franchise in history and one of the most culturally significant pieces in modern history and after watching the movie it is no reason why. This show from its atmosphere to the story to the acting is superbly made and everyone who has some sort of appreciation should watch this marvel of a film. Watch it.,1
1069,8.0,"Good Points: Truly a classic and, for its time, ground-breaking movie, Star Wars is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Even today the original movie, which is now actually Episode IV of course, holds up pretty well, even in the special FX department.  When you realize that Star Wars has been around for twenty-five years and Lucas can STILL pack a theater, all one can do is kow-tow to one of the gods of Sci-Fi. Bad Points: About the original movie, there is little to complain about. What few complaints one could conjure are due simply to the fact that the movie is so old.  But all things considered including age, the only complaint I have is that its very typical in a lot of ways.  With the exception of Princess Leia, all the main characters are men.  Surely a technologically advanced society would also have moved forward in a social way as well, meaning more women in positions of authority.  This is prevalent throughout the Star Wars series.  Also, Lucas's directing was a bit banal.  It was okay, but nothing spectacular.  Someone like Stanley Kubrick would have made the movie absolutely immortal.",1

1075,9.0,"Ah, Star Wars. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Sadly, one of the worst ones ever made as well. Do you know why? Two words: SPECIAL EDITION! I don't care if the cantina has a wolf-man in it! I don't mind the strange orange force-field under the land-speeder! I was born before (well, way before...) the Special Editions were released, and I'm proud of that. Let me just say some bad things about the so called ""Special"" Edition: 1- All the CGI is totally out of place and looks horrible! 2- The new ""Jabba the Hutt"" Scene spoils the revelation of the Millennium Falcon, plus, we learn NOTHING MORE than we did with Greedo. 3- Greedo shoots first. And misses! What's up with that?!? On the other hand, the Original Edition ROCKS! These are the films all of us grew up with! I'm proud to say that I won the Original, Unopened 1995 Edition last night on ebay! Yay ebay! And only for 15 stinking' dollars! Back onto the subject of the movie, even though the effects may look even more fake than the Special Edition, they fit like a glove, and don't stand out! As for the acting, the best here is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Everybody else is great, but he sticks out as an old favorite. If there's one good thing I can say about the sets, it's this: THEY LOOK LIKE PEOPLE WALKED AND LIVED THERE! They're dirty and scuffed, unlike any of the other sci-fi movie sets (not counting Episode 5 and 6). Of course, how could I forget the music? John Williams scores music that fits perfectly into every scene! The only track that should be in the movie is ""The Imperial March""! Overall, watch the DVD (the DVD'S OK), but don't watch the horrible ""Special"" Edition. Watch the movie that, in 1977, took us to a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...",0
1076,,"Star Wars: A New Hope is one of the best movies ever made. Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey have audiences been astonished by fantastic special effects and a terrific storyline. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia, working for the Rebellion, is kidnapped and held hostage by the Empire on their armored battle station Death Star. Luke Skywalker lives on Tatooine, a desert planet, when he encounters a message from the Princess that she put into R2-D2. He teams up with Ben Kenobi, Han Solo, Chewbacca and the 2 droids, R2 and C-3PO to help rescue her. This is the best in the trilogy in my opinion. The acting is a little raw in stages, especially coming from Luke, but the interaction between Han and Leia is entertaining, as it fortells their eventual relationship in the other 2 films. Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he has the best line in the film (The Force will be with you....always."" and his fight with Vader was good too, but it's boring when you think of how Luke and Vader fought. Darth Vader wasn't as evil in this film as he was in ESB, that trait fell to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star. Prime example: when he orders Princess Leia's home planet, Alderaan, destroyed to show the Death Star's capabilities. The battle scene at the end is awesome, lots of special effects and Vader even pilots his own special TIE fighter! As you know, the Death Star gets blown to bits and the good guys win, that is until ESB. This film is a lot lighter compared to the darkness the next installment has, but it has some of the best scenes, best acting and best music to make this the best of the trilogy. If you haven't seen it, rent it, you won't regret it.",1
1077,,"Star Wars is absolutely the best of the ""original"" trilogy and better than The Phantom Menace. It introduces the characters that us fans have grown to love and sets the pace for the next two films that follow. The plot is relatively simple: Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) steals plans to the Empire's Death Star, an armored battle station with so much power it can destroy a whole planet. While seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), her ship is attacked and she is captured by Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) and held hostage on the Death Star. She hides the plans in R2-D2 and him, along with his counterpart C-3PO meet up with Luke Skywalker, who joins forces with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to rescue the Princess and destroy the Death Star. Although this is the best of the trilogy, some of the dialogue is rather bland, but the performances are top notch. The interaction between Han and Leia forshadows their love in the next installments, and Obi-Wan starts to teach Luke about the Force. Darth Vader is excellent but he isn't as evil as he is in the other two films, that honor goes to Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, commander of the Death Star that orders Princess Leia's home planet destroyed. The effects are also good, the battle at the end of the film is exciting and suspenseful plus you get to see Vader pilot his own Tie fighter! This film is outstanding and I think with each viewing it gets better and better and better.",1
1078,10.0,"A New Hope is severely entertaining and is a lot of fun. Contains many dramatic battles and memorable one-liners that'll make you gasping for some relief. It was the first Star Wars film ever created and has withstood two generations of fans since its release back in '77.

It changed the way movies are made. This movie is truly amazing. quote another member of IMDb when I say this, ""A kid's fantasy. An adults memory."" You can remember this movie for the rest of your lives. The special effects were great for back then and the score of John Williams for this movie is the best ever.

A cliche in space, as I call it, was incredibly mediocre.  Bad acting, bad script, borrowed story.  Oh but the special effects! Sorry kids, effects a movie don't make.  I guess there's a lot of 7th graders (or folks remembering how great they thought this flick was when they were in 7th grade) voting on this so-called movie. I took my kids to see The Phantom Menace...at least Star Wars was better than that amazing waste of money.",0

The rest is history.",0
1085,10.0,"It's been over 35 years since I first saw this unbelievable piece of cinema. And the weird thing is that I was a little disappointed that first time. Star Wars had been SO hyped that by the time I saw it back in 1977 I was expecting a non stop shoot 'em up from start to finish. The fact that the movie came out of the gate so quickly when Darth Vader and his storm troopers attacked and boarded Princess Leia's starship only increased those expectations. So naturally the following scenes in the desert on Tattooine right after that intense opening were a bit of a letdown. The desert sequence seemed to go on FOREVER, even though it really doesn't last that long. It wasn't until the 2nd time I saw Star Wars that it really hit me just how great this movie was. I think the trick was that I wasn't watching it with expectations or a critical eye the 2nd time..I just sat back and enjoyed it. A friend at the time criticized it for not being good science fiction, but he had it all wrong. Star Wars isn't a science fiction movie per se, though there are some terrific sci fi elements in it. At its heart, Star Wars is a fairy tale..maybe the greatest ever told.",1

It built a world of unending imagination.<br /><br />I hope generations from now our grandchildren can still appreciate what this film did.<br /><br />Now my reason for not giving this film a full 10 stars is because of the enhanced version that currently seems to be the only version available.

It's a hard call for me to sum up every film I've ever seen & pick a #1, but this one would be close. I'm not one of these people that says that STAR WARS changed or in any way defined my life, but I am a really big fan of the whole star wars universe (the films, the ""fan"" films, the novels, etc.). I myself am an aspiring film maker & I'd have to say my inspiration to produce my own film stars here.

After that they were indoctrinated through Star Wars toys/action figures/comics and so on. I never got around to watching the Star Wars trilogy until i was 19 years old, and didn't really find them that special. The special effects are fairly good for the late 70s/early 80s, but the storyline isn't exactly something it would take a genious to come up with. I can think of many other scifi movies that would rank equal or over Star Wars. As for the prequels, Episode I was a dud in my opinion, Episode II was a smidge better. It's all really about getting to watch how the Anakin/Darth Vader thing plays out, but the three year waiting periods just ruins the whole thing.

The characters in this film are so unique and fun to watch that they can carry the whole film themselves. There is one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history as well as one of the most iconic heroes. Also Han Solo is such a great character. I also love Leia and Chewy. The chemistry that these characters have is really clear.",1

The only thing that I didn't like, is the fact that in a couple scenes, the acting wasn't the best, it was good, but not the best. I noticed that through V& VI as well. But that's because it was made in 1977, and they didn't have all the cool gadgets that we have today. So I would rate it a 10 on a scale of 1-10, but George Lucas, you did a REALLY fantastic job, same with all the other actors, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and all the other stars that participated in the making of these movies. You all did an amazing job.",1
1100,8.0,"While I think this film isn't as strong as 'The Empire Strikes Back', the advent of this film was probably more important. I don't remember when it was released (I'm only 19, I can barely remember 'Return of the Jedi' being released!), but I have never seen any film or television program previous to 1977 that is in the same league effects wise as Star Wars. While the story is relatively simple, young boy feels trapped on home planet, well you know the rest, the film is so successful because you feel that you are not just watching Star Wars, but you are taking part. The other great success is the effects of course. Now pushing 25 years now, the effects still look good (Amazing when you consider the increase in technology).

I think Harrison Ford did a good job, Carrie Fisher did a good job, Mark Hammill did a good job and Alec Guinness did a good job. I think this film has great sound.

Ben Kenobi, the wise old man with mysterious past is really an interesting and charismatic hero, Han Solo and his friend Chewbakka are hilarious and even princess Leia is nice - not with striking beauty, but likable and human. And the villain... Vader. When I was young I dreamed to be like him. He is a symbol of the true evil - big, black, menacing, ruined and with this skull-like mask. His voice, his powers and his attitude made him possibly the greatest movie villain, even if in this film we saw a glimpse of even greater evil in the face of the hideous old Emperor. The story is good for a beginning, but a bit slow. However, it becomes better in the next two movies.",1

But what really makes it shine is that this is the only film of the trilogy where there seems to be more emphasis on story, characters, and achieving a gritty kind of realism that starts to slip away in Empire Strikes Back and by ROTJ, with its overabundance of Muppet Show rejects in every corner, is almost eclipsed completely and everyone else from Harrison Ford on down seems to be coasting.",0

The movie that Disney Studios initially turned down, only to buy the series for six billion dollars decades later. Bet they're still kicking themselves for that. Like most fans, I prefer the original version with the practical effects before George Lucas went back and added all those unnecessary and pointless graphics and scenes, like that horrible addition of Jabba, and the same goes for the rest of the trilogy.

I'm so relieved to find other IMDb user comments along the same lines, to find I'm not the only one!....My name is August 4 and I am a Star Wars dissident! Is this SW thing some kind of contagious delusion, mass-hysteria or pseudo-religious fervour? Why do I feel as if I'm some kind of heretic? I love fantasy movies and became a cine-junkie back in the mid-seventies when the new breed of blockbuster was born. Sure I saw Star Wars, sure I enjoyed it. I even preferred The Empire Strikes Back (though Jedi is at best a rehash of the first two movies for the under-fives.) I think I've gone a little way towards qualifying my stance. I like the movies, really, I do! But can someone explain this madness to me? I'm so far past this obsession it brings me down to see the stuff everywhere, always, without respite, EVER. The toys, the gadgets, the books, the re-released soundtrack sets, the re-released video sets, the bed linen, the computer games.... On top of this, people around me greeting these things with enthusiasm, even excitement. PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP ME! For me, the films have always lacked a certain something; passion perhaps, a deep emotional involvement. Star Wars never hit me in that place that makes a movie something personal and enduring. The Dykstra / ILM special effects leave no space for imagination. It's all about technology, never beauty. That opening shot of the Imperial Star Destroyer going overhead has always left me unmoved, (this blasphemy alone would be enough for certain buddies to kick that chair out from under me!) even at the age of 10 when I saw it the first time round. These days I've moved onto movies with a bit more of an emotional kick. I'm still a dreamer, but I prefer characters to be defined a bit more clearly and the technology to be a bit more blurred. Beguiling as the trailer for The Phantom Menace looks, I think the SW franchise is on the brink of being devoured by SFX. I hope it's brilliant, but even if it isn't, prepare for it to be around FOREVER.",1

One of the most popular movies of all time and one of the most memorable stories told on the big screen crafts a sympathetic character that we follow fulfill his dreams of exploring the galaxy. The story is perfectly paced, and all the characters are likeable. The performances have all gone on to be classics. The story is so good in fact that its basic structure has been copied twice within the same franchise! Unfortunately due to low budget and the time of the release, parts of the film do not hold up at all. One particular scene on which much of the emotional punch of the film relies comes off more as silly now even compared to some effects of movies then and much more now.

Even from the first scene in the entire movie, it's clear the menacing and fearful nature of this frightening character.

1147,,"ok. Look at Star Wars. It is extremely hokey, and for the whole time, the stormtroopers for some reason can't hit the good guys. For the average viewer today, its just another ho-hum sci-fi flick. But Star Wars is #7 at the top 100. Why? Why is a film that is so cheesy in the top 100? Because of the monumental amount of creativity involved. Take a look at the Mos Eisley Cantina. There are probably dozens of different looking creatures, they all look weird, but are memoriable enough to leave their image in your head. Check out this new phenomenon called ""the force"". Truly, this is Star War's biggest and most creative idea that has not been taken from any movie...but it is spawned from George Lucas alone.

However, I have always seen it as the Empire being the British Empire and the Rebellion as the American revolution -- for independance.

I now own the original on laserdisc- no Special Edition bs. To me, it's the only version. The same is true for the Empire Strikes Back, which is no. 6 on my all-time list.

Before this film, Sci-Fi space films were very hoaky, and let's face it, ridicuously stupid! Space films before 1977 also made space look clean and more sterilized than a dental office. But in Star Wars, they actually showed space trash!They didn't try to make the future look clean and beautiful, they potrayed it as being a dirty, scary place, which it probably will be. The plot was very interesting for it's time, and still is today. I really like this film, and I would reccomend it to other people (80% of the people in the country have already seen it though).

The special effects are fantastic (thanks to John Dykstra, John Stears and all the others...) and the cast is wonderful. The good idea has been the one to choose the cast. the three principal roles are assigned to three unknown actors (in 1977 Harrison Ford wasn't still Harrison Ford) and to place two great stars of English cinema as supporting actors: Peter Cushing is exceptional as the evil Tarkin (he played the movie with slippers at his feet, because the boots were little) and Alec Guinness gives to Obi Wan Kenobi a mythic air.

Star Wars manages to introduce a whole new world filled to the brim with all kinds of species, planets, politics, and, surprisingly, religion.

1168,,"So much has been written, spoken, said and even posted in cyberspace about Star Wars (particularly this, its fourth episode, also known as ""A New Hope"") that it is difficult to even do the Legend justice even with my own words. Yet now, as we continue to count down to the release date of the fateful Episode II --- Attack of the Clones, we begin to realize that there is more to the Saga than even most of us dare to perceive. That it all started with one motion picture does not really say much about the Legend. That only happens when you dig deeper into the tales that have been told to date.    And that's not just the movies. There are the two Ewok TV movies, Nelvana's Star Wars toons, every known Star Wars book from Ballantine/Del Rey Publishing and Dark Horse Comics, and even Smith-Hemion's infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. All have contributed in one way or another to the vast chapters of the Legend. As an example, consider what become of little Cindel Towani, the young girl befriended by Wicket and his fellow Ewoks in the 2 Ewok TV films. The Star Wars Encyclopedia tells us that Cindel eventually grew up to become one of the leading investigative journalists on Coruscant. This, naturally, makes me wonder about her further adventures involving that aspect of her life; but, again, I may just leave that to the Dark Horse folks. My point, folks, is this: perhaps, especially in the wake of September 11th, we are indeed, as George Lucas himself called us of old, ""a generation growing up without fairy tales."" Is the Star Wars Saga, then, the ultimate fairy tale adventure of the post-nuclear age? Some have said yes, others no. In the end, as always, the real answer is up to us. By digging deeper into the various legends spawned by the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, we can perhaps see something greater within ourselves. I once called the Star Wars Saga our generation's version of The Lord of the Rings. ""Luke Skywalker may have set out to save the galaxy,"" I remember saying at the time, ""but now that the galaxy has indeed been saved, for whom and from whom has it been truly been rescued, and at what cost?"" Even now, so many years later, I am struggling to answer those same questions. That a mere motion picture lies buried under the surface is no longer an issue. If it were, we would not have websites like starwars.com and theforce.net. Then again, the Force was probably within us all from the very first. What do YOU think?",1

This film is a classic and it will be around forever. This movie has the greatest story and the best series of all time. Watching them from episodes 4-3 is the best way to understand star wars. This is one of those movies you can keep watching over and over. The special effects were successful to me even though it was oldies style. Seeing lasers bounce off the screen and watching the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader will get you very excited and especially the space ship battles. If you want to watch an awesome sci-fi movie star wars is the one. The force will be with you when you watch this movie.,1
1174,9.0,"To put this trilogy into perspective, it should be compared to another of great success. The one that I am referring to is of course The Godfather'. An appropriate analogy for comparison would be that of a family visiting an art gallery. They come to the The Godfather' display and the parents take a step back and seriously consider the portrait. The children take a look but soon loose interest and start to nag their parents ushering them to move along. The father has his hand on his chin  the customary body language of a man in deep thought and looking intellectually satisfied moves on the next display. A big hurrah for the young ones for the next artistic offering is that of Star Wars'. They go 'Wow' and the parents attention is also drawn in  the child within touched. They all move along with a facial display of joyful appreciation.",1
1175,,"The popularity of Star Wars has been slipping somewhat lately-there was this tremendous build up to ""Phantom"", but now things have fizzled somewhat as people have walked out of the film either enthralled or really dissiapointed. There's still quiet hype for ""Episode II"" though. The original-Episode IV-still holds up well, and the revelations in Episode I help enhance the movie somewhat, and raises a few questions. It's especially shocking to see Vader and Obi-Wan duel, after their first meeting in Episode I, and also it's interesting to think that the villanous Darth Vader was a young kid who raced in pods. Weird! The acting of Hammil and Fisher isn't exactly Oscar caliber, and the Imperial soldiers sound for the most part like their voices haven't broke yet-but there are some superb persomances by Harrison Ford, Alec Quinness and Peter Cushing. The film is a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end, although it drags in the rather unnecessary first half of the Trash compacter sequence, which is also the most annoying part of the film. The ""Special Edition"" enhances some of the dated effects, and adds some unnecessary new ones(Jabba and the Greedo shot), but it failed to fix the most obvious mistake, when Obi-Wan's saber suddenly shrinks during his battle with Vader. Overall, a fun and exhilirating film, enhanced by the revelations in Episode I, but those looking for more serious fare should look elsewhere.",1
1176,9.0,Star Wars really got started with this movie. At the time it was made no one had seen a movie like that before. It was action packed and had a great story going back and forth filling in the past and continuing the present,1
1177,10.0,Back when i was 8 years old...1993 my mother and father went out for the night and they got me a movie to watch. This was my first experience with Star Wars and i have bee enraptured ever since. Definitly one of the greatest movies of all times SW has redefined a generation and paved the way for new actors film makers and movies. The masterpiece not only has some of the greatest action sequenses ever(Death Star trench run) it has a plot that can be enjoyed and analyzed at any level. From 5 year olds to 40 year olds this movie can hold different meanings. I have to say Lucas is a genius and i cant wait for episode 2 and 3,1
1178,10.0,"When I first saw Star Wars, I was blown away. The movement of the spaceships, the laser guns, the lightsabers, the classic battle of good versus evil, all was just a spectacle to see. The acting is great for this type of movie; Han Solo is by far the coolest character. The free-motion cameras give the spaceships amazing movements, and the aliens in the cantina scene are amazingly weird. It is just feast for the eyes and mind. A beautiful movie with a simple but engaging plot line, based off of the Hero's Journey, it is all just a ride that won't end.",1
1179,8.0,"Well folks, I finally got around to watching that newfangled Star Wars movie that all the kids are talking about. And let me tell you, it's quite the doozy. I mean, I haven't seen that many special effects since I was in Vietnam and some of the explosions were real.",1
1180,10.0,"Like many movie franchises, they all have a beginning. The Star Wars (aka A New Hope) id the best of the series for it's great humor, intense action, and great characters, my favorite was always Darth Vader. I would recommend the unaltered version of this film which is available on amazon. I say that because the original unaltered version gets the story through best without the cgi Jabba walking with Harrison Ford which is just plain embarrassing to see. The action is great mainly dealing with ships and lasers, but there is one awesome and epic light-saber fight which is kinda short but worth every minute to witness the first ever battle. The character were a blast like the cocky Han, the young and brave Luke, and the Mighty Chewbacca, again I highly recommend this space classic",1

This film is the fourth of six movies (two of which have not yet been released), and it tells the story of Luke Skywalker who wants to become a Jedi Knight just like his dad, who he does not yet know is the evil Sith apprentice Darth Vader. The acting is excellent, the story is great and the special effects (especially in the special edition) are the best you will see. 10/10.",1

1186,10.0,"SW is a terrific classic. It has everything. Action,  Suspense, humor, spectacular special effects(even for today), romance, and almost anything else you could want. George Lucas has created a whole other universe. He has background history/info on anything from the characters to the aliens to the planets. SW is also very special because its sequels are even better. The prequels aren't as good, but they're awesome too. SW is definitely my favorite movie. I think almost everything is perfect. The plot, the effects, the balance of action, drama, and humor. Also the music, sound, and acting. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!",1

1190,,"I seem to remember that many years ago George Lucas admitted that the basic core idea for the movie was wholly derived from the Seven Samurai. Just as the Magnificent Seven had lifted that plot and re-located it from Japan into Mexico, so Lucas took the very same idea and re-located it into Outer Space. Count the heroes: Obi Wan, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. Seven, right? And they have to take on the whole menacing force threatening a nice, peaceful civilisation and restore order and justice. Which of course they do. OK, that basic plot is hugely embellished and adorned with highly impressive special effects (even now they still look great), but at the heart of it the original Star Wars film is essentially a hi-tech sci-fi re-telling of the Seven Samurai. BTW, I still can't bring myself to think of it as anything other than Star Wars, ""in brackets the first one"". How can it be Episode IV when it was the first one to be conceived? Is Lucas ashamed to admit he's just milking his cash cow? Or ashamed to admit he's not really done anything else of note outside of the Star Wars franchise? As for earlier comments about this movie having changed the world - or even just the world of cinema - all I can say is get real, get a life and get out more. It's a couple of hours of entertaining fantasy, and not all that original at that.",1
1191,,I watched Star Trek the first time around from 1966 to 1968.  Then poof. Low ratings.  No more Star Trek.  Every now and then an oasis (such as 2001 or Soylent Green) would pop up and temporarily satiate my apetite for good sci-fi.,0

1193,10.0,"I saw this movie a long, long time ago...hehe...when I recently found out that they were doing an Episode II, I was thrilled and delighted to jump back into the galaxy I so longed for and adored. I instantly went out and bought the trilogy, and watched it all over again. The first thought I had: Perfection. I couldn't get over how great it felt to watch all of my favorite characters again. I love these movies. They're action-packed, have romance (Han/Leia, hehe), and great special effects for that time- amazingly enough, I'm still impressed with the effects. Plus, George Lucas is a genius. The storyline impresses me too...for awhile I started to actually think there WAS a ""Force""...I still do, in a way. Point is this movie changed me in a lot of ways...it taught me that it's OK to have a wild, great imagination that runs on its own, to become interested more in film and the wonders of special effects, and the mysteries of human revelation. :)",1
1194,5.0,By modern standards this film is rather slow and oddly paced. A cracking opening 10 minutes and then a sad boy on a sand planet for the next hour. I can see that in 1977 this would have blown everyone's mind and one cannot dispute the Star Wars legacy. But looking at it decades later leaves a lot to be desired. Fair play to George Lucas and the crew for melting in Tunisia to get this made.,0
1195,8.0,"Way back in 1977, this film literally blew the entire world of cinema out of the water. My Mum once told me how when she saw this film new at a cinema in Leicester Square, the first image of a Star Destroyer sweeping overhead was the most unbelievable sight, and to that I can agree. This film is truly spectacular, even today it looks good!",1
1196,9.0,"This movie is obviously classic and I love it so much. The build up was immediately recognizable, but interesting. Luke Skywalker is now one of the most iconic heroes of all time, and I love his character development a lot. We didn't get to see that much lightsaber action, but the movie was still really good. That says a lot about it. Darth Vader is the most iconic villain of all time, rightfully so. He is very threatening and insanely calm at the same time. His story is also very beautiful. This movie is also surprisingly funny. It's no comedy masterpiece, but some of the jokes really land. Overall, this movie was so fun and insanely rewatchable.",1
1197,8.0,Star Wars is arguably the most beloved film for many generations to come and it's because of this movie to help turn it into a franchise.,0
1198,9.0,"I like this film because it is a mix of energetic action scenes and a decent Narrative(Some action films you don't get any). The film in itself made ""Sci-fi"" seem cool who knew that you could invent planets and species up and not be classed as a nerd or a geek or a weird person. The film is home to one of the best bad guys ever in the form of Darth Vader. His deep booming voice exudes itself in the corridors of the death star in which it makes the crew realise he is the BOSS and there will be know other like him. Luke Skywalker and Han solo make a formidable team but no one can compare in staring to Becca but sometimes his incessant groaning gets on me. Carrie Fisher provides good support as princess Leia but it is Mark Hamill who steals the show as Luke Skywalker",1

1201,10.0,"Personally, I feel ""Star Wars"" is the greatest story ever told. But, then again, we havent heard the whole thing. It has all of the story telling archetypes. If by some chance you have to learn about them or need to to write something, these are a GREAT set of films to study. It is the best set of films ever created. It is so creative and so incredible.

Your eyes are clouded by its popularity and because your friends and just about everybody likes it.  On the other hand to write it off as terrible with a blanket statement is a pretentious way of trying to establish oneself as an artsy person who really gets it.,0
1204,10.0,"It is difficult to imagine watching 'Star Wars' and not getting lost in its joyfully infectious spirit. It is one of those films that seems to have captured lightning in a bottle. The casting is perfect, the score is beautiful, the visuals stunningly imaginative and the storyline is wonderfully accessible. It is a movie that whisks you away for two hours and when it is over, any viewer must be a bit happier for having had the experience. It is an unabashedly FUN film, and that is sometimes a rare delight.",1

1208,,"Star Wars IV: A New Hope is a movie depicting a battle between the Rebels and Galactic Empire for control of the galaxy. Movie critics have defined the term theme as a central insight revealed in a film. The theme of Star Wars is centered on the character Luke Skywalker who becomes involved in the struggle between good and evil. Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, purchases two droids and discovers the connection between their previous owners, Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Alec Guiness; and Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. The droids reveal the kidnapping of the Princess by the Sith leader Darth Vader, voiced by James Earl Jones, and his plot to destroy planets with the powerful armed space station, the Death Star. With Obi-Wan's help, Luke and spaceship pilot Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, set out to rescue the Princess from Darth Vader. The story of these characters and their ventures is continued in two more films, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. ",1
1209,8.0,"When Star Wars was shown in 1977, it changed film history and people. It was a huge success, and it wasn't long before fans started to wear costumes and watching the movie for the 50th time in theaters. 20 years later, George Lucas made Special Editions of the trilogy, and it disappointed many fans. They said that Lucas butchered the films and ""raped their childhood."" I wouldn't know how to feel, since I wasn't there when Star Wars was first released. I didn't care for Star Wars when I first watched it as a kid, but upon second viewing, I liked it a lot more. Lucas' changes to the films never really bothered me that much (I couldn't really understand why many people hated that Greedo shot first. Nor who or what the hell is Greedo).",0

1211,9.0,"Just an opinion. Star Wars. The name clearly shows what is seen in the movie, but it's amazing how the saga, or rather the ""universe"" Star Wars, does not pass the feeling that something is bad, something evil people, the image of Darth Vader with the music who makes perfect sync with him, is not enough to scare anyone. The death of Darth Maul may have been the scene of more thriller saga, and even had blood. I say this tongue in cheek, but of course shocking scenes of thriller genre are not part of Star War, and should not do. The complexity of the lifestyle of a Jedi is a portrait of a disciplined good nature. The Star Wars universe has no doubt, makes sure the existence of force and it is proved in all the skills displayed by the knights, it has the Force not as a god, but as something that connects everyone and made them everything. The trips are simple in hyperspace! I think George Lucas portrayed much our world in Star Wars, however left the dark side of the force less obscure than ours.",1

I wanted to touch on a lesser talked about use of the wonder that is ""Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope"". This film has actually helped me recover when I have been sick. No lie. Here is my get well formula for everything from stomach flu to the common cold. One you obviously need to have the movie ready to watch on your television. Two have a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup (crackers are optional). Three you must drink a lemon-lime flavored soft drink (I'm avoiding using name brands here). After the soup and soft drink are prepared begin the movie and immerse yourself into the soup the soda and the spirit that is ""Star Wars : Episode IV A New Hope"". By the end of the film you will probably be feeling at least 50 to 80% better than you were. Well, it works for me.",1
1216,,"I would never have seen this movie in a theater if a reporter for The Wall Street Journal hadn't personally approached me and insisted that I must see it because the wise men on Wall Street were convinced that it was the wave of the future. The advertising hadn't appealed to me nor did the ordinary word of mouth, which said that it was lightweight intellectually compared for instance to ""Star Trek"" (the television series) or ""2001."" I wasn't pleasantly surprised when I saw the film because I didn't think the kinetic gimmickry or elaborate production design were a reasonable substitute for the strong characters and emotional themes that I had come to expect from the great action and adventure TV serials. Also, I felt the acting and dialogue were both substandard, except in the case of the robot characters. Some have said that the approach George Lucas used was intentionally ""camp,"" but these are the same people who think that ""The Lone Ranger"" is dated and only for kids. There's an art to making the audience sympathize with the characters in adventure tales, which seems to be way beyond the film maker's capabilities.",1

The beginning is too slow, like what is the point of those desert raiders or whatever, why are they in the movie? They don't add anything and are just slowing down the beginning even further. Then I got the feeling that much of the plot is driven by random events: The important robots are randomly transportet to Luke, Luke randomly meets Obi-Wan, the heros randomly stumble across the enemy base ie.

1218,10.0,Here's another film where everything fits. I was 9 or 10 years old when this film started in Germany. And I remember that after visiting the first trailer on TV I examined every issue of our newspaper several weeks to see when the movie starts. My father had no chance to refuse my bid to go and watch this film. We got the last two tickets and what followed was so overwhelming that I can't put it into words to describe it adequately. And I never forgot this feeling. Whenever I watch this film I see it through my children's eyes. So my comment is everything but not the slightest touch objective. For my present day view this gave me an unequaled gift. Whenever I watch a movie and it gives me the faintest feeling of what I felt there it's a very good one for me.

A New Hope is the rarest of films, one that stands the test of time, and one that no one could have predicted the success for. It spawned the greatest movie trilogy of all-time, yes, of all-time!

1224,9.0,"So many things have been said about this movie over the years, that's difficult to even know where to begin. The brainchild of a certain George Lucas and a clear homage to the Space Adventure serials of the 40s, this movie captured the essence of what it is that we want to see every time we go to the movies. It's a dazzling visual spectacle, sprinkled with a little bit of mythology, and populated with an array of well written and engaging characters. Everything from production design, visual and practical effects, to an immensely popular score by John Williams, that along with his forays with Spielberg (Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T..) is recognized the world over. It was also the introduction of one of the most popular villains in cinematic history, Darth Vader. His threatening and imposing physical presence coupled with the voice of James Earl Jones, made him the ultimate Star Wars villain that, even to this day, hasn't been matched in the Star Wars lore. That aside, it's an incredibly simplistic story but very well told ( although a big part of the merit goes out to Marcia Lucas, who apparently saved the movie on the editing table). This movie created a fan base and cult following, nowadays only matched by that of the MCU fan base, and helped define the term Blockbuster. So many scenes of this movie have been etched into the minds of the fans; those iconic shots of the Skywalker homestead on the desolate planet Tatooine, the introduction of Han Solo in an Intergalactic bar, which is clearly a homage to the Western genre, the first time we get to see Darth Vader, the looming presence of the Death Star, the iconic last battle... I could go on and on about the cultural and cinematic importance of this movie. Needless to say, if you can get a hold of a copy of the unaltered version of this movie, before the infamous changes made by Lucas for the 1997 re-release , that's surely the best way to enjoy it.

The only redeeming feature in it's favour were the special effects. The plot (if there was one) was paper thin and the characters for the most part were totally unbelievable and shallow.

1232,9.0,"I first saw 'Star Wars' in 2005 when I was around 7 years old and I distinctly remember thinking how fun this movie was, which is really the best word to describe the whole franchise, Star Wars is fun. Even though I grew up watching films filled with new age technology and mind blowing effects 'Star Wars' still made me feel like I was in space, travelling through hyperspace and visiting new exotic planets. For a film released in 1977 its technology and special effect still feel out of this world. Through the years I've realized that not only is it a fun film but it also works perfectly in setting up this trilogy. It's a classic tale of good vs. evil and this simplicity is one of the ways it differs from other Sci-fi were often the plot gets out of hand which is why many films nowadays are over the top. I don't think 'Star Wars' is the best film in the franchise but it is my personal favorite.",1
1233,,"What can i say about "" Star Wars""? it's a very epic and great movie that changed the way Science-Fiction is. All films including Episode I and Episode II are very epic in their own manner.

1234,9.0,"This movie has defined a generation, and spawned a multimedia empire. With its now classic scrolling text, it created a new genre of film - the space opera. Influenced by Joseph Campbell, Lucas created a space western that hadn't been re-created since in any serious way. Even the much loved Firefly never had the same cult following. Star Wars' timeless feel resides in its classic archetypes the white hats. black hats to boo, and a classic princess to be rescued. It has a John Ford feel, with comedic relief in the twin yin yang feel of the droids R2-D2 and C3P0, the teacher with Obiwan, the lovable rogue Han Solo, the sidekick with a heart of gold Chewie, the student Skywalker and the love interest with a kick Lea. This is one film series that will end up outliving us all.",1

1238,,"I have been reading some of the comments on this movie that some people have been putting up and frankly, I'm not happy. I know that there are a lot of flaws in this movie but so what? This is still a great movie. I've read comments on how the special effects suck and such. This just shows how ignorant some people are. The special effects in this movie were ground breaking. George Lucas basically founded modern special effects on this movies. If it were not for Star Wars there would probably be no LOTR. Which brings me to my next issue. I read someone comparing Star Wars with LOTR. They commented on how Star Wars sort of ripped off Gandalf using Obi Wan. WRONG! Gandalf and Obi Wan are both inspired by the ""old wise man"" template. That's right, I hate to break it to ya but Gandalf was not the original ""old wise man"". If George Lucas had never made Star Wars then he would probably never have started ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Which would have set back the special effects in movies by decades. Meaning that without Star Wars there would be no LOTR. I am not saying I don't like LOTR because I love it. Comparing the movies Star Wars and LOTR is like comparing the authors Tolkien and Robert Jordan. It simply should not be done. I think Star Wars is a great movie and It deserves to be in the top ten. So before you try and comment on how bad this movie is try and realize where the special effects in the movie industry would be if it were not for this movie.",1
1239,9.0,"I think this movie is fantastic. Especially the Theatrical Releases, the ones George Lucas didn't mess with. The story is a classic tale. a modern fairy tale. With a farm boy who sets off on an adventure after his last family is gone (well there is still his father *MAJOR SPOILER* Darth Vader *MAJOR SPOILER*). He must fight against the evil Galactic Empire. It is just one of those movies you can put yourself into and feel the action and the feelings your meant to feel. It is a true classic. Of course George can't take all the credit for this fantastic movie. It has a great by John Williams and fantastic acting by Sir Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrey Fischer, and we can't forget R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). Even though the movie may be oldish, the effects hold up even to todays standards, in fact I think they look better than most effects we see today! Overall if you haven't seen this movie, you are insane and need to watch it (don't be afraid if they call you a nerd. They're just jealous :)",1
1240,8.0,"This film is a very low 9. This film was absolutely astounding in it's day and in my opinion one of the best film ever made when it first came out, but nowadays it's like an old beat up boxer that can't compete with a lot of the top young fresh boxers. The lightsaber duel was kinda pathetic compared to the more recent lightsaber duels. There was some emotion in it, I'll give it that but other than that the lightsaber duel felt like a rather serious insult to Vader and Kenobi's actual power and made them seem like regular humans. I was also disappointed that the lightsaber duel didn't have hardly any references to the Prequels when they were fighting.",0

The music is good, but not enough action and adventure. When you go see a movie like this, you expect to see a LOT of action. The great action scenes that this movie had were dumb, I think.

It's a good movie that kids can watch, and some of the most repeated one-liners and statements ever created. It's not as good as that. It's an O.K. Movie. Entertaining, Ok graphics for it's time and decent plot. This is not a groundbreaking movie. And it's #9 on the IMDB 250 best?!? COME ON!!! This is just good, but no great. Why?!? Star Trek is way worse, so stick to this rather than star trek. I'm noit saying this is bad, It's very, Very Entertaining and all the sequels were good (Except Empire Strikes Back, That was SOO Boring). Don't join fan clubs and worship this movie.

When the text began scrolling across the screen, I remembered how a number of older films used that technique to explain the setting and the situation at the beginning of the movie. But, this was very different. The older movies had the words moving slowly and evenly from the bottom of the screen to the top. This film moved the words from front to back, using perspective to make it appear that they were disappearing into space, like a space ship flying away. The opening scene appeared to be earth, but I soon realized that there were two suns, not one. Then, I heard laser firing sounds and a large spaceship came across the screen. I thought that was really cool. But, following that ship was another that dwarfed the first one. In fact, the second one completely filled the screen as it moved past. I was in awe, along with the rest of the audience. From that moment on, I was hooked.",1

The plot mixes religion, mysticism, politics, human drama, etc on a vast scale and can be considered the ultimate film battle of good and evil.

The idea for Star Wars came from director George Lucas, who had written an incredible screenplay about ""a galaxy far, far away..."" Lucas' draft was rejected by many major film studios before 20th Century Fox finally agreed to distribute the movie. And thank god for that! George Lucas was to direct, Gary Kurtz was producing and Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher was playing our beloved leads! The film was shot with a tight schedule and limited budget, and the movie was masterfully edited, scored and visualized! After many commercials, we are back to the summer 1977! The film collected rave reviews, and ultimately grossed over 750 million dollars! The film went on to win 7 Oscars in the technical category, including Best Original Score, having lost the in the major categories to Annie Hall. ",1

So why did I liked this movie: Well it has an original, and gripping story, that now everybody knows, it has great acting,and special effects that blew my mind completely, and that today (In My Opinion) look better than most CGI crap today.

I remember when this movie first came out, i was about 7 years old and it was so fascinating to me to see Luke Skywalker with his light saber and the millennium falcon zipping through space at light speed, and the other colorful characters that make up this remarkable film were great too. Another good thing about this movie is you don`t have to be a kid to enjoy it. This movie is a classic and will go down in history as one of the best movies ever made. As far as the sequels go i don`t think their as good as this one but they are very good. rating (best of 5 stars).....5.....",1

The effects even if they are from the seventies are still some of the best I have ever seen. This movie single handed changed movie history forever. Just imagine a world with no star wars could you imagine a world without star wars no. The characters are the best.

In parallel with Ben Hur is the one quote which carries the next 3 episodes. ""Strike me down, Darth, & I will become more powerful than you can ever imagine."" This Obeone Kanobi quote makes & Darth's slaying him, makes his character like Christ in Ben Hur as Kanobi dies & then his spirit lives on in the force against the Empire.....A New Hope was just that for the American movie goer as this film represented a new hope that films are made which entertain & stimulate the imagination. George Lucas accomplished this & set the stage for much more with this movie. While the film had to be done on a tighter budget than the rest of the series, this made the acting & script more important in this film than in the others. This film made us want more. The climatic Death Star Raid sequence is arguably one of the best battle sequences ever in a science fiction film......it grips the audience with the fate of the rebellion in the balance. When I first saw this film, the great counter balance was with C3PO & R2D2 as robots behaving like comic relief from all the serious acting going on around them. This balance is important in making this film entertaining too, though is often over-looked by film critics. This film created a hero for a whole generation of film fans, even 2 generations now.",1

Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the coolest looking character of all time is Darth Vader.

But I'll try. No, I'll do, or do not there is no try. This film revolutionized movies, some say for the worse. But can anyone blame the stupidity and god-awfulness of Batman and Robin on the  coolness of this movie? Star Wars is an old pulp-inspired serial treated with respect. Those old films were never given something as original as a lightsaber. George Lucas dosen't treat this anything more than it is, but at the same time, there is an underlying religious and mythic aspect to the film. Luke goes through the same transformation as Bilbo Baggins and other epic characters have gone through. He is reluctant to go on his mission at first, but through a series of events he is thrust into the center of action. He mets the guardian father-like figure in Ben Kenobi, the doubter in Han Solo, and the evil personified character in Darth Vader. In this particular film, he is whiney and naive, in the second film he is the learner, and in the third film he, finally becomes a hero and is a Jedi master. But I've already gotten too preachy.

Not every movie has to be an artsy-fartsy flick to be worth watching.  Yes, maybe 2001 was a better pure sci-fi movie, but it's also the most boring 2+ hours I've ever spent in my life.  Star Wars never tried to be a thinker's film - it just tried to be entertaining, and managed to do so in a way that no other film has before or since.  It's a perfect example of the whole being much greater than the sum of its parts.",1

1304,,"Star Wars, now one of our classic science-fantasy melodramas, having been criticized for some valid reasons (too much tawdry merchandising) also takes a lot of unnecessary flack from critics who fail to recognize that they are criticizing elements inherent to the adventure-melodrama. Probably the most significant feature of this film, Lucas' great space-fantasy epic, is that it gave baby-boomers & later generations a chance to have our very own Flash Gordon styled film series. To understand the quality of episodic, Wagnerian opera and to realize how rarely this excellent dramatic form has been attempted through the last 12 decades, is to begin to understand the value of this gift. There are obvious similarities, such as how the musical themes are boldly attached to the characters' entrances. But a lesser recognized relation between Wagnerian opera and adventure-melodrama films is the simple-minded character studies (i.e. under-developed characters) and the accompanying simple-minded sentimentality that in both genres is enhanced by highly sentimental music.",1

It is fair to say my opinion may be compromised, however I feel that episode IV is a well executed tragedy with carefully placed cinematography that amplifies the essence of this story. Forgiving all special effects and fantasy settings, this is a classic Greek tale of tragedy and triumph against the gods. Many other films become centered on the detail of each moment rather than the purpose of the characters and the story. Episode IV is well centered in its direction and never strays from the point. Little can be said for some of the other films in this franchise.",1

1307,10.0,"Whoever you are, this movie is a must-see. If you are not a fan of sci-fi, to each their own, but I highly suggest taking a chance by watching this movie. I do not care if you are nerdy or jocky, male or female, rich or poor, happy or sad, short or tall, or somewhere in the middle of all those, take a chance and watch this movie. If you are unaware, this movie beat the odds and changed the industry forever. However, before I tell you why, let us first talk about the story. I have never seen a film make use of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey more effectively and iconically than ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"". Other movies that follow the hero's journey are, for example, ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""Spider-Man"" (2002), and ""The Lion King"" (1994). All of which are superseded by ""Star Wars: Episode IV"". Within this story consists of great characters. There is the young farmer boy who will save the galaxy; a cocky pilot with a furry friend; two comical droid tag-alongs; a princess in distress who is a strong, influential female lead; an all-around menacing villain that is one of the coolest bad guys anyone would cheer on; appealing armies that duke it out in a now-or-never battle. You will fall in love and feel for these characters. Also, it takes more than engaging characters to make the movie. It takes great actors to bring the characters to life. To name just a few, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse/James Earl Jones, Peter Cushing, Sir Alec Guinness all did outstanding jobs adding depth and emotions to their respective characters. Now, this movie faced substantial opposition from multiple areas. I will say the most resistance came from people who thought this movie would flop. Not only just thought it would, executives and viewers of early cuts expected it to bomb. Even George Lucas, who is the director and writer of the movie, was so sure it would crash and burn! (Note: Steven Spielberg predicted it to be successful) Another opposing force was the movie's funds. First of all, the movie had a low budget of $8 million (was then bumped up to $11 million). Second of all, over half of that was spent on never-before-done special effects. Not to mention, scenes that used those special effects were later scrapped. Third of all, on a more individual level, George Lucas agreed to receive a lower salary for 100% merchandising rights (this was seen as a fool's gamble, especially with ""Doctor Dolittle"" (1967) failing miserably at merchandising sales). But, by golly, the movie was a success. Not just any other successful movie, but a huge success! Despite screening in a mere 32 theatres on opening day, it raked in $1.554 million over the weekend and has since made over $700 million in the worldwide box office profit. Remember that unwise gamble George Lucas accepted? Lucas not only reaped millions of dollars in profit but also forever changed how movies merchandise! Hopefully, this helps in your decision to watch this movie because this is truly a remarkable movie from start to finish. Just within the first few seconds of the film, you will see the classic line ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" Then, the audience is hit by something like a figurative truck when the beautiful ensemble of musical genius flows like a river of chocolate into your ear canals, all while the audience is reading engaging backstory that is necessary to understand the beginning of the movie. Mix the music and the opening crawl to produce nearly uncontrollable excitement and anticipation for the gold the audience is going to find by watching the film. I have seen this movie countless times, and it never gets old. It is a solid film, and I cannot find any fault with it. Therefore, I give ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" a perfect rating.",1

True, it is set in a different galaxy with beings different than us, but I think the main emphasis is the story and not the setting.  Lucas and the screenwriters did a fantastic job creating a believable world.  The Force is the most intriguing concept.  It is a religion, really.  I just saw Lucas' interview on Rosie today.  I knew I'd been reading the right meaning into the story! God is Love!  This is a story about a conflict between genuine good and evil.  It's about a fall from grace and finally, redemption.

He has borrowed (I am being nice here) from other great works (RIngs being only the most obvious example), Dune, Kurosawa's works and on and on.  The original release of Star Wars was absolutely perfect.  Everything that hit the cutting room floor needed to be there.   Han should have shot first.  Not Greedo.

Is arguably the most iconic movie score of all time, Williams created a musical master piece that people love to this day, I guess the only complains you could pick are the light saber between Obi Wan and Vader, which has aged quite a bit, but again, knowing the amount of problems the film had behind the scenes, you kinda have to forgive it.

Anyways, If they did Starwars 1-3 Ala 1989-93 then Kirchner would have directed with Robocop2, Predator 2/Terminator, graphics inspired by Ridley Scott and HR Giger I would turn my head and look. At least clone wars would have been done correctly. Then you would have two wins. A still youthful cast to cont the franchise via the best comics in history. That's right I bought Jedi Knight Dark Empire i &ii during those times. Luke joins the dark side...the emperor is cloned...the introduction of world destroyers and tie phantoms, the empire is hurt a little. The clone bats are destroyed, Anakin Solo is born. Obviously at the end of the novel, the Jedi are rising or winning even if Pinnacle moon was destroyed. I highly doubt an advanced civilization like that would just crumble and fall. They would get singed at the end, that's it. So they should have winged it, do 1-3 and 7-9 in the years before computers. Models=automatic win, harder but better. Pull off a harry potter with dark empire i-ii. Make the final movie like how you see it today, remove phantom menace and ROTJ completely from existence, or at least make it rots, a little more darker (not for kids..dark). Make phantom menace in the tradition of a new hope. Have attack of the clones as another win, change title to the Clonewars..or make the cartoon into a live action series idk. Make rots as a win or lose (rotj felt like an ultimate win, puppet wars however the good guy wins throughout the movie, making it not to believable, hence the empire is millions strong, they would just reform which they did). Rename 3rd movie as rise of the empire since it felt the empire should be rising and you have a compilation. Phantom menace lost bad, it was like phantom menace with a race scene. Remove the race scene, put like an escape scene again. Darth maul needs to be more hostile, he needs to be the Bobba Fett before Boba Fett arrives and returns via a Sarlac Pitt. Also Jango Fett could clone himself, but maybe black market some alien's blood instead. It makes sense if the alien is intelligent in form etc. A modern Jesus, or a race of giants, I don't really know. ",1

This film doesn't ask too much from the audience, it just expects you to enjoy the ride, an intergalactic struggle of wills and politics. The special effects aren't much compared too what we expect these days but are used in such a way that they aren't noticeable. The story moves in such a way that we aren't bored and are always on our feet expecting different things from the plot, but knowing that our heroes will be OK as the cosmos moves in such a way that will guarantee their survival.

I'm glad they put them back in, even if it was with the new effects (which I don't hate, I just don't think are as good as the originals), so a whole new generation of kids (of all ages) could enjoy them in the way they were intended.

1358,10.0,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is the reason movies exist.  This two hours of brilliance and magic is two hours well spent. I have loved this movie for more than have my life, and it never gets old. When two droids escape a Reble cruiser that was under attack by the evil Empire land on a remote planet calle Tatoninne the adventure begins.  One of these two droids, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), carries the technical read-outs of the planet-sized Death Star which has the fireing capibilities to destroy a planet.  R2 must get the planes to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness), and then get safley to Aldrean.  Along the way R2 and his counter-part C3P-0 (Anthony Daneiels) get capitured by scavengers called Jawas, and then sold to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammiel) and his uncle Owen.  Eventualy Luke, 3P-O, and R2 find Obi-Wan, and discover that Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is being held capitive by the empire and the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) aboard the Death Star.  The four hire Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and his co-piolet Chewbaca (Peter Mahew) to take them to Alderan in Solo's star ship the Mellinum Falcon.  When they reach Alderan they see it's been completly obliterated by the Death Star.  The 6 are then captured and then go about the space station to find Leia.  If I say much more I'll spoil the ending, altough if you haven't already seen it you haven't been on this planet. The acting , story-telling, directing, score, and suspense is superb. Sir Alec Guiness is great as the wise old jedi-knight, Mark Hammiel is exelent as a winey young farm boy, Harrison Ford is superb as a daring scounderl, and Carrie Fisher un-beatible as a sort of bratish princess who is in charge of the Rebelion against the Empire.  George Lucus is a wizard, or magigician who casts a spell on veiwers. This movie is the best one in history.  I give Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope 11/10",1

George Lucas did a phenomenal job of bringing this story to life. I loved how the futuristic world wasn't all shiny new chrome, but had a worn, lived in feel. Harrison Ford is the perfect Han Solo, and James Earl Jones' deep voice was dark and threatening (the only reason I wasn't scared was because I kept seeing Mufasa) All in all, even if you're not a big fan of science-fiction movies, this is one film you have to see, along with all of its sequels and prequels.",1

1373,6.0,"i've seen a lot of fan(boys) of the star wars series on the internet and elsewhere. it's really rooted in our culture by now. so i decided to give the original trilogy a shot. so i obviously started with the first (fourth) one. i wanted to look at it with a critical eye and give it some constructive criticism. this movie is actually pretty decent and enjoyable, but obviously has its flaws too. I'm gonna talk about both. 1. the characters: the characters are great. the character development and interaction are mostly good. from the characters the best one is Harrison ford's Han solo. he's really the classic cynical antihero which creates funny situations when interacting with the more hero type characters such as Luke or princess Leia. Darth Vader is also menacing but he's really just the appetizer for the sequels. the other characters are also good in their own way but Han solo and Vader are the best ones 2. the villain(s) and action: this movie has both a singular and a collective villain. the singular villain is the dark lord Darth Vader. he's as said a very menacing character with near endless power and resources. but they kept him more tamed to shine more later. then there's the collective villain of the whole empire (and storm-troopers). they suck. every scene where the main characters have shootouts with the storm-troopers are boring because there are 0 stakes since (after the Vogons) the storm-troopers are the (second) worst shooters in the galaxy. which means there is no tension and i don't feel anything. the storm-troopers are such bad villain(s) that it's basically a pop culture joke by now. 3. the story: the story is fine. it's simple but effective. though a problem i've had is that there are some huge coincidences. for example: the robots which hold the information about the death star got very coincidentally on a planet which obi wan happens to be in and even before got in the possession of (the) Luke Skywalker. but those are probably very minor problems. the rest of the story is good. it's the classic hero saves the princess. except it's set in future and in space. i guess that's clever. though the story and the movie (most likely intentionally) don't go much far into the whole big story. there is no Yoda and Jabba the hut is just barely mentioned. not too much happens. and compared to ,,Empire Strikes Back'' it's really weak. summary: an enjoyable entertaining movie though with some flaws is definitely not bad but the fans still overrate it with the entire series.",0
1374,10.0,"Star Wars is one of the most important films Hollywood has ever produced, it marked a huge turning point in the way films were made and marketed. George Lucas struggled for years to make this film happen, he is a true visionary of cinema and people should never forget that. His ambition and creative mind allowed the world of Star Wars to come to fruition. To me Star Wars is Cinema, it has the classical story of rescue the princess but set in space. However it is the way that George Lucas told the story, amazing visual effects, bombastic sound, mythical plot points merged with very likable characters, all of which was refreshing for Hollywood in the late 70's, people were entertained again. The 70s were a special decade for film, many great modern classic films were produced by Hollywood's younger talent, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, Ridley Scot, De Palma, Kubrick. But Star Wars created hysteria on a global scale and is unlikely to ever be seen again on this level. So to George Lucas thank you very much for giving us Star Wars and influencing so many of the great blockbuster film makers we have today including James Cameron and Christopher Nolan, without Star Wars Hollywood would be a very different place.",1
1375,4.0,"'Star Wars' is the great American icon...I know that. I will be pilloried for saying it, but 'Star Wars' is just not deserving of the hype attributed to it. To say it is a fun film, fine. To say it was visually dazzling, great. But to proclaim from the treetops that it is the pinnacle of film, and that we should all bow down and worship the mighty Lucas for creating this wonder is simply dumb. Lucas set out to do two things: A) pay homage to the old Buck Roger's serials, and B) utilize the basic storytelling archetypes from the myths of old. (Joseph Campbell can tell you more about those than I). I feel he accomplished both of these goals. Unfortunately, he failed to insert an intelligent story along with it. For all those who say that film should be merely lighthearted entertainment, I say balderdash.

How are you?' The security guard replies- who the hell is this?' Solo blows up the transmitter, then concludes in the subtlest of ways (to himself) boring conversation anyway'. An obviousley improvised scene (and who'd have thought that in an episode of the Star Wars saga?) there are no moments of this spontaniety in the other films. Its' with this humour, a subtle level of camp, and the sense of Joi De Vivre you get from witnessing something truelly spectacular unfolding before your eyes with the perfect sensibility of avoiding over ambition that makes this easily the best film of the saga. The characterisation is clearly spot on (Han solo is easily way cooler here than in the other episodes) and there is not a dull moment in sight.

1418,10.0,"An excellent movie with everything. Entertainern, very good characters. Especially Vader and Luke. The space battle at the end was also very good. Han Solo, C3PO and R2D2 works perfect as comic reliefs. Very good effects for 1977. An excellent movie.",1
1419,10.0,"Before the mid 1970's, special visual effects weren't really made to look as real as life, because it was just commonly accepted that it was not possible, so what are you going to do.  In 1975, ""Jaws"" was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when ""Star Wars"" was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects.  Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for ""Star Wars"", people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening.  Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the ""Special Edition"" was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977.  Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds.  After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction.  The ""force"" is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as ""out there"" as some people do.  One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it.  Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief.  There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence.  John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous ""Imperial March"" wasn't introduced until ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980).  ""Star Wars"", although it was the first to be released in the series, is actually part four of a six chapter saga.  The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision.  He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be.  As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined.  I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of ""Star Wars"" and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the ""Star Trek"" fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it.  It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for ""best picture"", but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be ""Star Wars: A New Hope"".  If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.",1

It might not be perfect, but it´s unique and certainly the most influential film ever made.

Anyway, it's hard to judge it when 20 years ago there was nothing to be compared with as there iss today, but I think that even in the VCR this movies looks great (when I saw it again about a year ago in the movie theatre I was kind of disappointed because I couldn't catch the original magic)...

1429,8.0,"First of all, I would like to say that I did enjoy Star Wars.  But only for the entertainment of it.  The film isn't some kind of ""high art"" or something.  The best sci-fi film out there is by far 2001.  Then Dr. Strangelove.  Star Wars isn't sci-fi.  It's part western, part myth, part legend.  But not sci-fi.  It's not a pioneer in special effects. 2001 is. Whoever said that ""nothing in the following years is better"" is wrong.  I believe you said that Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark were not better. That's your opinion, but Jaws was made before Star Wars. I like art films.  2001, Psycho, The Godfather.  My favorites.  And, although I enjoyed Star Wars, it is not correct to call it the greatest film ever.  The acting is horrible, and the characters are lame.  Han Solo is the only good character (besides Anakin, and maybe Obie-Wan) because he is flawed.  Luke is barely flawed, and the few flaws he had disappeared within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Leia isn't flawed at all.  Good characters are flawed, severely.  Norman Bates (Psycho), Micheal Corelone (The Godfather), The Human Race (2001: A Space Oddyssey).  All flawed.  Great stories have flawed characters.  It's always been like that.  Anyway, that's my two cents.",0
1430,10.0,"Only released in 350 theaters across the nation in May 1977, Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope soon became the highest grossing movie of all time. But, there was a bumpy start for the space drama, now revered by millions as a type of quasi-religion.  It took five studios for George Lucas to have his screenplay, ""The Adventures of Luke Skywalker"" picked up by 20th Century Fox. Soon, changed to Star Wars:  Episode IV- A New Hope (and formally called Star Wars), it changed the face of movie viewing, and made ""nobodys"" Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford known world wide.  It made words like ""Wookie"" and ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" household names.

While still holding the ever-famous, ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" the only changes in the re-release, on video, is a few scenes, including one with Jabba the Hutt.

Even though I am not a fan of the prequel movies I will say that the story of the whole saga is simply genius.

The special effects were groundbreaking for that time (I might add they still hold up well to this era of CG visuals). John William's score is still one of my all time favorites and really was the first sci-fi movie to use orchestrated composed music that was completely original. That brings my next point about Star Wars, I never considered it being an actual sci-fi movie.

Everything about this movie is enjoyable; the plot is a good old adventure story, where an unlikely hero saves the galaxy.  However, even with it's standard plot, Star Wars catapults itself to a higher level than most adventures.  First off, it has amazing special effects for its time. Even though it was made for only $10 million (pennies compared to some of today's blockbusters), it still shines through with very well-done visuals, especially with some of the alien costumes.  Needless to say, this movie inspired an incredible cult following, as well as four sequels, two Ewok T.V. movies, a horrendous Christmas Special, and too much merchandising to count.

It has an intriguing story, action, humor, romance, cool special effects (pre-CG, but way ahead of their time in 1977), a tremendous musical score and has moral lessons about greed, temptation, sacrifice and loyalty. Good and Evil are clearly defined and the fight of Good vs. Evil is the central theme. George Lucas and his extremely talented crew got everything everything right in this movie. The movie benefited from two previous Lucas projects. THX-1138 and American Graffiti. STAR WARS blended Lucas' interest in technology with warm, human, defined characters.

Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together.

The story is absolutely awesome everyone watching it is backing Luke and wanting everyone on the millennium falcon to triumph. One of the best parts of this film is the universe that it puts you in and the different species/people you get to meet along with all there separate stories. The only problem with the movie to me is some of the acting in the film, it really isn't the best it could be but with the places and scenes the characters are in, the acting isn't ever unbelievable or bad enough for you to loose interest in the characters.

Like everyone else I love this movie as its effortlessly re watchable, tons of fun, has engaging characters, a simple yet compelling story and ground breaking special effects. There is never a dull moment to be found as the pacing is pitch perfect.

But upon enlightenment in the wonders of the world I found how Lucas takes so many classic elements of great stories and combines them to make one fantastic tale.  The tale of a nobody in the middle of nowhere gaining the chance for adventure and excitement, teaming up with a wiseman and two scruffy characters to rescue a princess from an evil dark knight, an almost medieval tale by modern standards. Most of all the movie captures the ability to never grow old, in that one can watch the movie countless times, memorize the lines word by word, yet still have one's heart beat faster, bring smiles and cheers and boos and hisses at the sight of  Darth Vader. How many films can do this???  The Odyssey, one of the oldest works of literature known to exist does this too, for all of those who have read it in its entirty.

The prequels are not the only Star Wars films to be affected by Lucas' bad dialogue. Its when one consume such media that was sourced as inspiration the the film it is far from unnoticeable that large aspects where copied. This is by no means in a manor of plagiarism but rather as a homage. Many people have compared the film to that of the like of Kubricks 2001 - a space odyssey but personally I reject such comparison, with perhaps exception of its influence on visual effects. Firstly they are two vastly different films 2001 being a science fiction whereas star wars being more of a space fantasy. The other is the quality of the visual effects. Whilst the quality is overall remarkable for the period, 2001 has aged much better, with Star Wars looking dated no matter what stupid ""remaster"" George Lucas does. The characters are endearing but at times somewhat cheesy. The love hate relationship between C3PO is still great to see.",0

1469,10.0,"It's safe to say that the age of cinema has updated in the 1970s. We did have many SciFi movies and TV shows in the past. Movies included Stanley Kubric's 2001: A Space Odyssey(1968) and TV shows included Star Trek(1966). But it wasn't until the 1970s when we got huge cinema hits. The two big Science Fiction products of the 1970s included Ridley Scott's Alien(1979) and this movie. If I had to choose one, it would definitely be Star Wars. Also known as A New Hope, this movie kick started a huge franchise that still continues to this day. Directed by George Lucas, Star Wars brings us to a world that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away where an ever raging war continues. Participating in that war are the Imperials, led by Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader, played by Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher. When the Princess gets captured, farm boy of Tatooine Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, is warned by two droids, played by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker, that a desert hermit called Obi Wan Kenobi, played by Sir Alec Guinness, is the Rebles only hope. It turns out that Kenobi is actually a warrior called a jedi, who have long been thought dead after a massacre 19 years prior. After losing his aunt and uncle, played by Shelagh Fraser and Phil Brown, Luke decides he must go with Kenobi to help save the Rebel Alliance from certain doom. With the help of a pilot and his partner, played by Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew, the group must save the princess and destroy the Empire's doomsday weapon before the galaxy is put through chaos. What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is honest to god one of the best movies ever made. It was ground breaking when it first came out, and still is today. Every time I watch Star Wars, I feel the 4 year old me jump out of my body and remind me how great the movie must've been to audiences who watched it back when it first came out. The characters are all great. Luke embodies a hero who doesn't know his destiny just yet, and his journey is just beginning. If only audiences knew what would come to him in the later movies. Princess Leia is a great character too. Although she is a typical damsel in distress, she stands up for herself and fights alongside her group. Han Solo and Chewbacca (Chewie) is one of the greatest movie duos of all time. The fact it spreads over 30 years is absolutely amazing. And Obi Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 will always be the simple characters that define SciFi for me. But of course, there's the villain. While he is the most popular character, Darth Vader is by far the best character in this movie. He is the character that has been in the most movies in the franchise, and that is why I love him. We get an entire story line over the course of over 40 years(including Star Wars:The Clone Wars). Although he is barely in this, he still makes an intimidating figure that stays with us in this world of pop-culture. As for the rest of the characters, they are not in it much, but they leave an impression. Now for the visuals. While the movie has had a visual face lift since the original release, but what's left of the original visuals still leave the impression of 70s cinema for me. The sound effects by Ben Burtt still make me smile and you can find me mimicking them on any day I'm in the Star Wars mood. And finally, we have the emotions. They can range from cheery, to suspense, to even sadness. And that's another reason why this movie is what it is for me, it balances many emotions all at once. So overall, if you have not seen Star Wars, I recommend you take the spare time you have, make some popcorn, and enjoy this eye popping masterpiece that should be loved for years to come. 10/10",1

They read the script and say sure go ahead and give him a modest budget and a nice huge crew to create this film.  It takes at least a year and he finishes it and lets everyone that made it and they are satisfied with it.",1
1472,10.0,Star Wars-Rating = 9.0/10,0
1473,10.0,"Star Wars not only transports you to another galaxy but fuses action with the right amount of humor and introduced the world to some of the most memorable characters of all time. I think I can pinpoint the moment I ""became a woman"" to when Han Solo usurped R2-D2 as my favorite character. It's not just that it's Harrison Ford at his hottest with a super sexy wardrobe (that vest! the little jacket he wears in Cloud City!), but the fact that he's a rebel struggling with the fact that he's found a cause and a group of people he can care about. Practically everyone in Hollywood tried out for the role of Han Solo including Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Murray! But Lucas finally went with Ford, despite originally being dead set against using an actor he had worked with before. I think what makes Ford an ideal Han Solo is the fact that he really wasn't taking anything too seriously. This gives Solo a cocky but sweet vibe that is completely lovable. He purposely didn't rehearse his line for the scene where he must stall over the intercom in the detention block so it would seem spontaneous. It's such a fun, cute moment and it makes you realize how important it is to have the right cast. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/02/star-wars/",1

I tend to regard it as something from my childhood and leave it behind.  Nonetheless it is still a classic movie that I have never forgotten since age 5.  This is really the only George Lucas movie I like (besides the sequels and prequel).  This is the most lighthearted of the original trilogy and my second favorite beating out The Empire Strikes Back.  With that said this movie will remain a classic for many, many years to come.",1

1479,10.0,"George Lucas had vision...and it included light swords, space battles and giant lasers! Seriously though, Lucas was ahead of his time due to several points that helped shape movie making today. First off was his interpretation of what a dog fight in space would look like, both from an aerial view and from the view of the cockpit. Lucas also wanted to make the the fighters dive zig zag and spin.<br /><br />And of course a film featuring futuristic technology couldn't be complete without a technologically advanced camera. Lucas used the the Dykstraflex, which was the first digital motion control photography camera system...seriously look it up, it's something out science fiction. It allowed for more smoothly filmed space battles with less errors on the cameras behalf.",0
1480,10.0,"Star Wars episode four was an excellent movie. It had a lot of action in it. It did not have as much as the new trilogy did, but still, it had just the right amount of action. There were definitely a lot of good parts in this movie, and it was a great way to start out the Star Wars series. But still, how did it start out? You'll have to see it all in the new trilogy that George Lucas is coming out with. It won't be as good, but it will explain everything well. This episode actually had pretty good graphics. Outer Space actually looked like outer space. Also, if you like sci-fi movies (fantasy), then this is for you. It takes place millions of years ago in a different galaxy with advanced technology and a power known as the force that controls what happens. Well, that's about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone at all. I don't see how anyone could dislike this movie.",1
1481,10.0,"I was just a little tiny girl when I first was introduced to star wars, and I didn't like it one bit. It was loud and long and I didn't understand it. However, after a few years I developed a deep nostalgia for this movie and everything it represents. My heart swells everytime Luke looks up at the starry sky on tattoine and the music just helps carry the mood- that you know something great is going to happen. I kick myself for being so unapprieciative when I was younger, since If i had payed attention I would have bought right into it and had some valuable collector toys to go along with some fantastic childhood memories of this classic, timeless fairy tale about a poor boy, who grows up underprivledged only to find out he's a prince who's destined to be a jedi knight. So pretty much this review is like most everyone elses on here- Thrilling Movie and well worth your time. Watch the whole series in one setting for a fatastic, intergalatic epic that will transport you to a galaxy... far.. far away. 10/10 of course.",1

1483,10.0,"Completely perfect. Not a thing wrong with it. This movie is, in my opinion, tied with three other movies for the greatest ever made. The three others being Episodes 1, 5 and 6. It took a genius like George Lucas to make a film this great. I first really saw the movies in 1990 when I was about ten years old. I have never seen their equal since.",1
1484,,"George Lucas' most influential film is often considered a science fiction film.  I completely disagree with this.  A science fiction film, in my opinion, is storytelling which tries to make us feel like things are out of the ordinary. Aliens and spaceships don't automatically certify the film as sci fi.  I would consider Star Wars a fantasy, because it takes us out of our world and into another.  Star Wars is pure entertainment, fulfilling one of the key purposes of cinema.  One of the reasons Star Wars has been so successful is because it is like a cure for everyday life, you can just leave to another galaxy far far way.",0

Although it is MY favorite movie, (Get your own favorite movie) anyone, and everyone will enjoy it. It may have spawned nerds, a generation afraid of the sun, and people willing to pee in Tupperware in order to see the guy who was in the Darth Vader costume, it'll make you want to wait for him too.",1
1486,1.0,"being , as i am , a fan of classics such as the seminal Howard the duck and the outright classic water-world(surely Kevin Costner's finest hour) i was thoroughly disappointed on viewing the so called classic that is the messed up patchwork disaster that is star Wars episode 4. Just one example of this dire movies trademark is the 40 second panning technique, which everyone knows, when used in the wrong context (not too mention poor lighting) only drags the film into anti-climatic sequences with little reward for the viewers patience. the poor use of English grammar is also abundant with the Cookie being most guilty of this crime .... i for one could not understand a word that this thing said , and yet i am supposed to believe that the rest of the cast could as they freely reply with so called humour to his comments. I could comment as to how bad the casting is in much length; for the sake of time i will merely mention just what a terrible choice Harrison ford was. HARRISSON FORD??? why, when there are so many other talented actors out there, delroy lindo for example would have been superb as the swaggering space pirate Han solo. also , who made the crazy decision to replace the voice for Darth Vader to James earl Jones , when anyone who knows anything knows that the Cornish accent is brimming with menace and merely chose to steal proses finest hour. the plot is a complete pile of contrived rubbish as of the like i have never seen in any sci-fi, for instance anyone with only a rudimentary knowledge of alpha based gravitational upper physics would know that the destruction of a planet would have serious ramifications for the Eco system of any star system within at least a billion flighty years (and par secs don't exist). as a closing comment: if you would like to view a truly outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema, with amazing special effects, humour, fantastic action, superb cast and thrilling plot, then i refer you to (the always awesome) ice pirates, starring the charismatic Robert Ulrich (froms TV's Vegas).",0

The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because that should be a privilege for true perfection only.

If you like rescue the princess cliches, watch Shrek or play Super Mario Brothers. Not this awful movie. And there is barely any action in any of the movies except the 2003 anime, which is just barely enjoyable. <br /><br />Also, this movie is a blatant rip off of a Nazi propaganda film called ""Triumph of the Will"" so if you like this movie, then you support Nazis.",0

We mean engrossing, inviting, and just plain real. Action movies nowadays never seem to be possible. They just seem to show technologies advances and provide us with plain eye-candy.

Skywalker is a name that all movie fans know and this is due to a great script and a terrific performance by Branscombe Richmond.

That said, not even a performance as great as Richmonds could have made this film what it is alone. Credit must also go to Brian Blessed who brought great appeal in the role of Han Solo and also to George Harrison for backing the film with his Beatles money.

I also don't get why they must go through the trench When they could just enter at the end and then fire. This is definitely the weakest of the three because of its ending but It's entrance is the bets of the whole SAGA. If you haven't seen this what are you doing So go out and watch this and rate it.

There isn't a single idea that has anything to do with science fiction. Picture horses or sailships instead of starships and you'll see what I mean.",0
1543,,"I wont bother telling anyone about the plot - we all know it anyway.  All I will say is that the beauty of Star wars, and its sequels and to a lesser extent prequel is that they are classic good vs evil stories.  They do not rely on violence or adult themes to convey this.  The dialogue is poor at times but I can forgive that because of the many other wonderful features.",1

1546,10.0,In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time.  To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story.  I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better.  The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining.  The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today.  I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there.  The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing.  For  entertainment I can't find any better movie than these.,1
1547,,"The best movie of the original Star Wars trilogy always gets better with me everytime i see it. The best thing about ""Star Wars"" is that, although its over 20 years old, it still does not fail to entertain. I can watch this for weeks and still not get tired of it. The whole cast and crew did a magnificent job and there really is no flaws in this movie despite the lightsaber sequence between Obi Wan and Darth Vader, which really if you have a good eye, just ain't lightsabers. :) This movie is the same thing to movies to Sci-Fi as Muhammed Ali to Boxing... it made it soooooo much better. Sci-Fi had been given a bad name before with the outrageously silly Star Trek and finally it had found its savior in Star Wars. Without a doubt, the best Sci-Fi film ever made has to be ""Star Wars"". I mean, it has everything what you need for a great film; comedy (R2-D2 and C3PO), intense action, drama, suspense, and contains unbelievable special effects for its time that no one had ever seen before. Even today if this film was released, there would be no problems. I actually like the hard-work artisan technology in the old films than I do with the new Star Wars films. Funny, isn't it? Kudos to Harrison Ford for his arrogant laughable self as Han Solo (which people actually credit him more than Indy), Mark Hamil, Carrie Fisher, and most especially Sir Alec Guiness who if Ewan McGregor aged, I could picture him looking exactly like that. Unbelievable film that should be ranked #1 in Imdb Top 250 without question. If you want quality, entertainment, durability, and fun... check out Star Wars and you won't be disappointed. Out of 10 stars, an easy 10.",1
1548,6.0,"When you get over the nostalgia (difficult, I know) and take a hard look at the facts - this movie displays: bad acting (with very few exceptions, namely Sir Alec Guinness), very mediocre directing, dated special effects, basic plot line (good against evil, final showdown, etc.), and very few redeeming qualities - perhaps the excellent score by John Williams.",0
1549,6.0,"Now, after 33 years of having heard about this movie i finally decided to buy its DVD taking into account its rating on IMDb and its historical success over most of the people. i guess that i am maybe not compatible with this saga, though i new i was going to dislike it even since i was a child. But now, when i finally decided to take the risk to watch this movie what i found out confirmed all what i had thought before. I Found a silly and very overrated film, i couldn't have seen it all if i didn't keep reminding myself that this was an old movie.",1
1550,10.0,"Star Wars. Wow, well, there's not that much I can say really. It was the first film I can remember seeing and truly loving. I must have been about 6.

1551,,"In this film, a far-away, long-ago Galaxy is under the rule of a Galactic Empire, enforced by the evil Darth Vader(David Prowse, James Earl Jones). However, a small amount of freedom fighters have rebelled against the Empire and stolen the plans to the Empire's secret weapon-a Moon-sized planet-destroying superweapon called the ""Death Star"". When Rebel sympathizer Senator Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) is forced to hide the plans in a ""Droid"" robot(Kenny Baker), the droid finds itself into the hands of young farmboy Luke Skywalker(Mark Hammil). Seeking the aid of exiled Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi(Alec Quiness) and space pirates Han Solo(Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) Luke becomes involves in a quest to rescue the princess and destroy the Death Star. The film is a fun roller coaster ride from start to finish. The film's acting is pretty good;although the performances of Mark Hammil and Carrie Fisher can be occassionally whiny, they still have good chemistry together. Harrison Ford, Alec Quiness, and Peter Cushing all give great performances. Many of the special effects still hold up today, even without the ""Special Edition"" releases. In 1997, a ""Special Edition"" was released with new special effects and some new scenes. While the SE fixed many of the film's dated Landspeeder and X-wing FX, it also added unecessary additions, mainly to the Mos Eisley section of the film.",1

To be honest with you, few people in Taiwan are crazy about Star Wars. Even you conduct an investigation on how many people take interest in Star Wars, the result would flabbergast you. Therefore, I seemingly turn out to be a geek or nerd in Taiwan society where all but nobody goes banana when it comes to Star Wars, even though it is no doubt a pop culture phenomenon in the U.S.",1
1553,10.0,"There is no Denying that George Lucas had a unique vision for Science Fiction. Star Wars (1977), is the film that changed the business of Special/Visual Effects. Many Fans consider, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as the Greatest of the Series (which it is), but it is this film that truly stood the test of time. George Lucas was inspired by several classic films including Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece Epic ""Seven Samurai"". Lucas also turned to books like Classic Mythology, Fairy Tales, as well as focusing on topics of Spirituality.",1
1554,10.0,"A classic from cinema. The film that change special effects forever and that is In the front of other movies at the time. The plot is astonishing, as Lucas creates an story In which a hero has to defeat and iconic villain such as Darth Vader. This movie is an Icon of the culture of the XX century and continues atracting the new generations",1
1555,10.0,"This movie was spectacular. Star Wars paved the way for science-fiction becoming mainstream culture. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader was iconic and phenomenal. Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams's score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now.<br /><br />The cinematography was outstanding. From the desert planet of Tatooine to the ominous Death Star, feels both real and fictional. The acting was incredible for people who had just begun their careers and Harrison Ford's Han Solo is an unforgettable, charismatic performance. The music in this film really stands out. John Williams outdid himself and made one of the most iconic themes to exist in movies. The plot is a generic yet fun hero's journey that keeps you entertained from start to end. Star Wars is an iconic film that has changed pop culture from westerns to sci-fi.",1
1556,10.0,I feel like I prefer episode IV to episode V for one reason only. Sir Alec Guinness. I do accept the fact that Episode V is better but it was all made possible cause of the original and the story and connection of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader.,1

1558,10.0,"This truly has to be one of the most amazing filming endeavours till now. The special effects are barely outdone by those of overpriced and overhyped movies of the last decade. Yet they were created over 20 years ago...and the techniques used for the creation of Star Wars still form the basis of many of the modern special effects techniques. But technology and sci-fi plot aside, this movie could just as well be filmed as a medieval or modern drama and would still carry the same appeal. Rarely have I seen a movie with better rounded characters which are easily identifiable in everyday life. The entire trilogy shows an excellent introspective look at the human mind and soul. Even the 'good' characters have their flaws and struggle to overcome them, and even the 'villains' have their inner doubts. These struggles however are not pushed 'in your face' they evolve and are subtly presented to the viewers. So if you are still one of the unfortunates who still haven't seen it...DO SO! And if you don't like the sci-fi genre, try and look through the sci-fi shell and try and find the deeper underlying principle.",1
1559,10.0,"I can not say enough about this film. It is the film that changed my life. Star Wars is more than just a movie to me, it is a lifestyle. I can not thank everyone who was involved in this film enough. Ever since I first watched the original trilogy I have looked at life differently. These films are about The Empire vs. The Rebellion reminding us to never let the government control our lives. Not only does it have philosophical meaning but the movie itself is just so much fun. Every single character in Star Wars will be remembered forever. So many iconic character like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3P0, Darth Vader, Obi Wan, etc... Star Wars is something that everybody must see before they die. It created a world no other movie will ever be able to create. Star Wars truly changed everything about the world we know. As I'm sure you can tell it is my favorite movie of all time!",1
1560,8.0,"This movie is good on the whole, but I'd be hard pressed to give it a ten rating. (A movie deserves a ten rating when the acting is also excellent, and I'd have to say Star Wars failed a little in this area.) Though the acting failed, the story succeeded in being interesting and exciting--the struggle between dark and light is not flat like it usually is.",1
1561,10.0,I'm only leaving a comment because I was surprised to read so much negative feedback about this movie.  Come on... Star Wars is one of the single greatest motion pictures ever created.  Ever.,1
1562,,"Star Wars is so embedded in pop culture that reviewing it like any other movie would be to undermine its impact.  It's a science fiction spectacular in the tradition of old Saturday morning serials, but with amazing special effects that revolutionized film as we know it.  It's character list reads like a pop cultural glossary: Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi... These aren't just characters, they're institutions. We hear these names and immediately remember the magic that Star Wars brought to an entire generation.  It's bigger than creator George Lucas and star Harrison Ford combined; and it has spawned the largest fan base since Elvis or the Beatles. The film's qualities, the wonderfully imaginative people and places, the lightsaber duels, starfights and cryptic ""force"", all contribute to a movie and a phenomenon so popular that it can never really live up to its own hype, but comes darn close.",1
1563,10.0,"If any film has a claim to the greatest film of all time it is surely this. It spawned probably the greatest movie saga to ever grace the big screen...STAR WARS! It invigorated what was basically a dying film industry; it opened the door for countless more sci-fi and fantasy films that have been ambitiously created over the years. Peter Jackson himself said that he was inspired to taking on a task as large as Lord of the Rings after seeing how George Lucas had dealt with Star Wars. More immediate inspirations would be Alien and the Star Trek Movie; sci-fi successes inspired by Star Wars. But moreover it is the ultimate cult classic; it influenced the lives of an entire generation in 1977 and when it was re-released in 1997 it did a similar job, as I am part of that generation. It is not only a critical part of the film industry and critical part of western society. I truly believe that an epic like Star Wars is good for the world in every way. It symbolises hope or a NEW HOPE as the case may be. It is a modern fairy tale that delivers all the right messages. Or if you're just in it for the entertainment then there's isn't anything to complain about there either.",1

1565,7.0,"Great special effects especially for the day. Plot was somewhat simplistic, but it was action packed and entertaining largely due to it being fast paced and lacking any real dull scenes.

1568,10.0,"Star Wars. There is no doubt in my mind that this is arguably the best motion picture in the history of cinema. It has all the elements and rewards of a great film. It has the premise of classical mythology translated into Jedis, The Force, and The Empire. It has memorable characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, and the infamous Darth Vader. It is literally a phenomenon by which we can cherish our childhoods and enrich our adult minds. No other film has had the magic touch on audiences that Star Wars had, and no other film ever will. Thirty years from now who will remember the movies of today? But fifty years from now everyone will look back at Star Wars. It is the perfect mixture of vivid storytelling, detailed directing, great characters, and visually stunning action sequences that have yet to be outdone. Star Wars capitalized on everything that a good classic should be, and for that it deserves the highest place on any list of great films. Whether it's #15 by the American Film Institute, #2 all time box office, #7 by IMDB, or #1 by me, it undoubtedly will hold a place in everyone's hearts.",1

Now I was completely impressed by this movie, not just because of the awesome action and acting, but because it had the best special effects of any movie I'd ever seen up to that time. It includes many TIE scenes which I've learned to love as the movies went on (the battle at the end was PERFECT) and I thought the story was fantastic. The problem that I saw with the movie was that I had no idea what was going on in the opening scene, where the Rebels try to escape from the Star Destroyer. I didn't know what the 'Empire' or 'Rebels' were, and I didn't know what the 'plans' were for. I think they should have shown scenes describing all that stuff before the movie was finished. But believe me (and if you don't believe me believe every other breathing object in this world) this movie was GREAT, AWE-INSPIRING...every single descriptive adjective in the book that's a synonym for the word ""good"".",1

I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place.

Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1- 3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision.

This movie took all of us back to right winning over wrong and began to give us hope again. This is one of my favorite movies, I love the sets, the costumes, the plot, the characters, the new inventions and the genius that Lucas put forth in his ""experiment"".

The comedy from the androids, and Han Solo was also great, and to a young kid, the anti-hero behavior of Han Solo made it seem genuinely real.",1
1579,10.0,Just a great movie all around you can not dislike this movie there is awesome fighting scenes maybe a little goofy looking but it is still awesome. Judging by the year that it was released you would think that it would be boring and graphically poor but it is very good for it's time!,1
1580,8.0,"While A New Hope revitalized sci-fi in cinema, it does have some flaws. I'm not saying the movie is bad; in fact it's one of the best in film history. However, it doesn't go very high up the Star Wars movie ratings. The story is well driven and the characters are perfectly round and suitable for the plot. The typical underdog vs favorites plot rolls out as a rather unique on because of the sci-fi genre. The sets, compared to its time, are wonderful. The effects still sometimes felt fresh even to this day, which shows how revolutionary A New Hope was. The final battle is one of the best final sequences ever, possible the best in Star Wars history; there's suspense, action, pace, and everything to present you a powerful finish for the movie. Speaking cons, the movie suffers some issues in dialogue, and more noticeably in the first act, which feels lost, boring, and at times irrelevant. Unfortunately, the actors (who have become legends today) didn't present a perfect performance; instead, their acting felt flat most of the time. But it is understandable why people were amazed by every shot of a movie that came out in 1977, when all they had were movies about desert shootouts and police car chases.",1

Darn that stupid Titanic for breaking it's gross $ record! Anyway, why are these movies so popular? They can relate to anyone. From 3 year olds to 90 year olds. They have action, romance, mystery, and anything else you could ever want in a movie. So maybe they don't have the top technology, so what? I mean, neither did The Wizard of Oz, but you don't hear people knocking that. My only hope is that the new installments are as good as the classics. If they're not, I'm not going to sweat it.

I was the right age, and it sparked off an interest in all things sci-fi.  I had been a fan of TV series rival Star Trek.  Ironic that a film which didn't over-indulge in scientific terms (a parsec is a measurement of distance, not of time!) sparked the true beginning of my interest in technology. This film is superior to the others in the sequel due to its freshness.  An epic tale of morality and struggle against oppression set against a seamless background of space and unfamiliar technologies and alien beings.  A film which transcends technophobia.  A fantasy-adventure movie of which Gene Roddenberry might have been proud. While it is said that Harrison Ford hated the series, no one could have played the part of Han Solo better. No outstanding acting performances, but the sum of its parts add up to an all-time classic, enjoyed by young and old. If you haven't seen this film, you can NOT go wrong with it.",1

I don't even remember the first time I watched it, I imagine I was still in the womb! :) In any case, this series of movies shall be remembered for generations to come as one of the greatest events in cinematic history. It has everything for everyone. Adventure, drama, comedy, sci-fi, fantasy, and even romance. It's an enchanting and sweeping saga that pulls the viewer into a fantastical world with a multitude of characters that one can never forget. The charming Hans Solo who's rough, dangerous attitude is turned around when he meets the beautiful and independent Princess Leia; the innocent Luke Skywalker who always dreamed of bigger things and soon became an honored Jedi Knight and a peoples' hero; the dark and brooding Darth Vader, who seems to be all-encompassed in evil until his son finds the good in him; these and many more are the characters that come to life in this treasured epic. So I don't understand when people scoff at these movies when they've never even seen them. There IS a reason there is such a fuss about Star Wars, and it's because it's good. People that over-analyze too much get lost in the critiquing of a movie, to the point where they can't experience the joy, exhilaration, and wonder movies like this bring about. Now, I'm no big time movie critic. In fact, it's very easy to please me with movies. But maybe that's the difference between me and other reviewers. I watch a movie for fun and for relaxation and for the trip it takes you on from reality into imagination, but they watch it so they can search for something they might never find. Just once, try getting lost in the moment. There is no feeling like it--you'll get chills and goosebumps and whatever--because you'll be feeling in the sublime. That's what movies mean to me. That's what Star Wars means to me. When that perfect musical score by John Williams comes on and the stars brighten in that immense spacescape, I feel it and I know what a movie can do for the soul.

Adults know that in the real world there are plenty of shades not just black and white. But nevertheless we keep telling our kids fairy-tales. When you think of STAR WARS as an epic tale, which reduces the complex universe to the ultimate and eternal fight between good and evil, you might see how wonderful it can be. The characters are brilliantly played and their positions are very quickly set. I want to say that I liked all actors and their performances.

Oh...My...GAWD!  To see a 70's movie only at the age of twelve that completely blew me away is only a one in a million experience.  The special effects are still amazing by today's standards.  everything done today is using CGI, but Star Wars manages to still be the one film that has the most jaw-dropping and groundbreaking visuals for any movie to date.  there is more to the movie than the Visual Effects.  Star Wars is still good enough to set the standards in today's filmmaking.  It has an incredible sense of character, with enough in it to keep a person captivated after the tenth time watching it.  The acting is exquisite, particularly Alec Guinness, playing the mysterious Obi-Wan Kenobi (he got an Oscar nomination for that role).  Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fischer have great chemistry together.  The true heroes in this tiny phenomenon are C-3PO and R2-D2, who provide the comic relief that every good movie must have.  they are certainly more lovable than a certain blundering Gungan.  Oh!  And who can forget the deep, bone-chilling voice of James Earl Jones as the fearsome Darth Vader?  Brimming with intensity from beginning to its climactic end, it isn't hard to see why this movie is loved by so many.

This was during the dark ages before VCR's and Cable TV. Sure, we would go to the movies every once in a while, but my folks weren't real big on checking the local listings or reading movie reviews, so we'd usually end up seeing whatever happened to be playing at the local theatre.

He did it with the most simple of ideas - good guys defeat bad guys; he did it with humor; he did it with feeling; he did it with excitement and fun.

The way that a farm boy grew up and had to save the galaxy from his father was an ingenious plot.

Believe me it dosn't happen very often. When I first saw Titanic there was some applause at the end but nothing like Star Wars. At the time Star Wars was released no one had seen anything like the special effects it contained. This was the Granddaddy of all the Sci-Fi movies that came after it.

Star Wars is perhaps the first and certainly the most successful film to exploit its ""Filmness.""  It tells a story that could not be told as powerfully or convincingly in any other medium.  From the brilliantly mixed sound, to the monumental style of shot composition, to Williams' Royal score, Lucas pushes each element of film as far as he can.  The editing alone is an unprecedented  tour-de-force as this story flies by so fast, you're afraid to blink.  Yet the story is simple enough that even at this pace, a six-year-old child can keep up with every element of the story. Star Wars so overwhelms the senses (it's impressive now on TV, so multiply that effect for the mid-70s theatre-goer), one is hardly able to notice the craft that holds it together.  Maybe that's why all we've talked about for 22 years is the story.  During the theatrical re-release a couple years ago, I noticed what a uniquely constructed film it is, and how each element contributes to the experience.  Anyone interested in discussing the series intelligently needs to look closely at the glue of this film, otherwise we're just comparing plot and character, which are in actuality, probably two of the weaker points of these films.",1

George has set the stage though and what a set up it is with so many possibilities to be explored in the Star Wars universe. It has a Hero, a mentor, a cowboy, a princess, A dark overlord a pair of bumbling droids and an ancient art rekindled by Jedi master Obi Wan Kenobi. People who grew up with Star Wars find the series to be a sentimental favorite. It launched the career of Harrison Ford who's Han Solo by the end of the series enjoyed more popularity than that of the hero Luke Skywalker.

As for the characters, at times quite annoying and apart from at the start, with Luke, there's little emotional build. In fact, the robots have more charisma and likability. What is missing is the bond between viewer and characters. Why should I care about these people? Why should I be rooting for them. Being instructed as to who the goodies and baddies are is not enough I'm afraid. Overall, there's far too much bang bang, zap zap and rushing around for this film to be enjoyable.

The DVD changes in the next two episodes are much more apparent but I'm sticking to Episode IV for now. Its good the series is on DVD but the changes on this DVD are distracting and distance you from what you see on screen because they are so obviously added. Lucas has more shots of the surface of Yavin and Tatooine (to set the scene I guess) as well as changing the special effect for the Millennium Falcon jumping to hyper speed and seems to have shortened the explosion of the Death Star for the climax. Very Nip/Tuck but also quite obsessive. Perhaps Francis Coppola's modern views on his own works (Apocalypse Now Redux) have rubbed off on Lucas but I truly wonder what is the point to the new additions/changes on this particular movie. Change for the sake of change. It is his right to change his film around in anyway he may see fit the question however is why?,1
1670,10.0,"Ah here we are, the big cheese, the top dog, simply one of the greatest films ever made. Looking back its a miracle this film turned out the way it did (especially when you watch those prequels). Every aspect of this film stands on its own. Firstly, theme, who doesn't love the main Star wars theme? Or the Imperial March? Really one of John William's finest pieces and thats saying a lot! Special effects are once again dazzling. The assault on the Death Star remains the greatest sequence I have ever seen and guess what? It's not in 3D! And thers no CGI! Wha!!!???? 99% of people must think thats an impossibility! A simple story, Good vs Evil blah blah blah we know, but the ideas of the Force and Obi won Kenobi really add something more. That famous scene with Luke gazing out at the sky longing for something more really adds an emotional dimension. Some truly legendary moments in this film, I just hope George Lucas doesn't go back and CGI some stupid character(cough Jar Jar Binks) to be running around the background. Actor wise this film is often criticized, but eh Alec Guinness??? Peter Cushing?? A great backing cast. Mark Hammill is critically acclaimed for his voice-over of the Joker and deserves high praise for his performance in this film. Carrie Fisher is feisty, cheeky and strong (although she may not be necessarily acting!) and Harrison Ford, ah what more needs be said about Han? Simply too many positives with this film, a true classic and example of movie-making magic! A must see!",1

1673,,"Coming from a person that wasn't ever really interested in star wars, this movie really got me surprised. With an old school feel and almost a serious tone the whole movie, the movie really demonstrates space warfare in a very particular and in its own fashion. It has a story filled all sorts of characters and each scene holds something you'd never expect. And the soundtrack was one of the best of its time. I also liked how it left you off wondering what was gonna happen in the next movie. This movie truly wasn't like anything else of its time and just stood out. I don't know how in any way the developers fell short on the movie.",1

1676,10.0,"Star Wars is and excellent movie without a doubt. I think it's the 2nd best out of the 4 Star Wars movies. Although the plot maybe kind of old by now. It changed the way we saw movies over 20 years ago, I still wonder sometimes that people might only think it's great because of the special effects. Maybe not us interesting as TESB, but without a doubt a great movie. It has an excellent soundtrack. Listen too the bit where Luke looks at the Sunset on Tatooine. Although I am disappointed that the Biggs Darklighter scenes were cut. After viewing them on the behind the magic cd. I think it would of added a bit more of a human touch too it. I think the Special edition scenes were ok. But the scene where Greedo shoots at Han is just silly. How can a bounty hunter miss from a metre away. It might seem like I am being very negative with this movie, but there just little things I think would of made the movie just that little bit better. Star Wars shows us new worlds, different aliens, technology and it's really interesting too watch. If anybody has not seen Star Wars, I strongly recommend it. 5/5 Stars but not as good as Empire.",1

1678,,"As pure entertainment it hasn't been surpassed, not by Jaws, not by Indiana Jones, nor by any other movie made in the twenty-one years since its release. As a ""serious, profound"" movie, many dismiss it. I think it has a little more redeeming value than that. It isn't a Bergman movie, which means it doesn't meditate on the issues that fuel it. But it does weave together a number of archetypal elements: the lightsaber (Excalibur), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Merlin), a prince (Arthur), a princess (Rapunzel/Snow White/Sleeping Beauty), and two quarrelling droids (Frick and Frack, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the Odd Couple). Even the father-redeemed-by-the child trope is basic. The Force derives from a number of Asian concepts, especially the non-duality of yin/yang, although Lucas makes the slight mistake of giving the Force a moral quality, which only the Force's wielders, and not the Force itself, should have. All these create a mythology for the twentieth century, something which no other movie has managed. For better or worse, Star Wars is our re-version of the Illiad and the Odyssey.",1

1680,10.0,"The simple fact that the Star Wars universe continues to generate so much attention from young and old alike is a testament to the creativity of George Lucas. Essentially a simple plot (the triumph of good over evil), the film has the perfect blend of (especially for 1977, and still good now) special effects, swashbuckling and romance. Simple words cannot describe what it is to experience Star Wars. The only way to fully appreciate and understand is to see it for yourself.",1
1681,,"There are so many reasons why I like this film and its two sequels so much. First of all, I grew up with the trilogy; It has great nostalgic value. Also, it's a film you can watch as a kid, and then watch as an adult and see so much more.  The main thrust behind the first film is the idea of the human spirit vs. technology.  This aside, ""A New Hope"" is relatively lightweight, but that is what draws so many people to it.  They know they're going to have fun watching it.  Yes, it lifted plot elements from comic books and Saturday morning serials and (most obviously), Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress.""  However, this was the point.  It blended these and other elements with a mountain of imagination to come up with something new. George Lucas has said that he originally intended ""Star Wars"" for a generation growing up without fairy tales.  It is ironic that, although many consider this the pinnacle of science fiction cinema, it's really not science fiction at all.  The technology is taken for granted, it's set in the past rather than the future, and it really is, at heart, a fantasy epic, in the truest form of the word.  The only difference between the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and the classic epic form is that it is written in prose rather than verse.  However, I don't think anyone can blame it for that.  Also, I couldn't end without at least mentioning John Williams' breathtaking score. Using the ""leitmotif"" approach, Williams accented the rhythm and pulse, and provided insight into characters and situations.  Many of the characters have identifiable themes or motifs, and this helps the audience, sometimes without their realizing it, understand certain actions the characters take and certain situations in which they are involved.  I don't really know if ""Star Wars"" is the greatest movie ever made, but it is one of my personal favorites, and something I've watched many times.  I've enjoyed it every single time.",1

The dialogue is corny, the characters are not that compelling, and if seen on the small screen where the special effects(the best part of the movie) don't come through, it can be very disappointing. I've seen it a number of times, and I get bored very quickly.  I just can't understand why everyone seems to love this movie.",1

1686,10.0,Definitely ahead of it's time and by far the best SF movie series ever. I love the integration of the spiritual (wu-shu like) part of the movie. The invention of the light saber is great in my point of view as this being more fiction then reality as I heard in other documentaries I saw about this subject. Many species of aliens make this movie a real treat and keeps it from getting boring as in my opinion humans really got bored of each other. In my opinion all of the movies in the series are equally beautiful not like other movies when seeing the second part is greatly disappointing. Everybody these days are only trying to make money. I sincerely think this is not the case.,1

We have a new and fresh balance, of a simple story, with villians who are completely evil and heroes who are completely good, with an exotic and colorful world, ""That's how you make a Blockbuster"". (The poor acting is also noteworthy)<br /><br />Other things that can be highlighted are the incredible special effects, which for 1977 were the best ever made, with a not so high budget it is worth mentioning.

The magic ended after the third release. Watch the first three. Forget the rest. They are just mediocre action flicks. The first three are epic examples of the human dilemma on the big screen. Religion, politics, love, war, courage, stupidity, marginalized people and spirituality. All of this facilitated by the wise council of Joseph Campbell who helped George Lucas get it just right.",1

Best story telling? ....hahahahahahaha! Its a nice mythology for today, but it has never delved into deep human emotions like a good movie could. It is considered science fiction/ fantasy.

1703,8.0,"In 1977, George Lucas created one of the best and well-known films ever made, Star Wars. Even the name radiates excitement. When I hear that title I can't stop thinking about the first time I saw ""A New Hope,"" and how much I wanted to be Luke Skywalker. I wanted to be told that I was a Jedi, and had greater power than I ever thought I did. I remember having a toy millennium falcon that shot darts out of the front of it. My brother had a tie fighter, and we would ""fight"" them all the time. When I was little I had to own every color of light saber. My dad bought me my first light saber for Christmas. It was green, and I loved it. I took it everywhere. The first Star Wars movie is called ""A New Hope"" because that what it gives to Luke Skywalker. He just wants to leave home to become a pilot, but he never thinks it will happen. Star Wars can give real people a ""new hope"" too. It was a about a year ago around thanksgiving break. We had gotten a new youth minister that fall, John David Crowe, and his son Noah had brain cancer. I remember just around thanksgiving Noah had a big MRI coming up. Noah was 3, almost 4, and his favorite movie was star wars. His favorite characters were the sand people. One of the adults that went to our church changed his Facebook profile picture to a picture of a sand person, and he commented on it telling everyone else to change their profile picture for Noah. I got on Facebook and changed my profile picture to R2-D2. Soon hundreds of people were changing their profile picture for Noah. But better than that, all these people were praying for Noah. I know ""the force"" isn't real, and I know that it wasn't Star Wars that saved Noah then, and I realize that Star Wars wasn't the only thing we had. But Star Wars brought us hope. It let all of us bind together for a cause greater than ourselves. We prayed a lot too. Noah died in May of 2012. Its hard everyday for a lot of people especially John David. I'm trying to give credit to Star Wars for having magical healing powers. I know it was God that was there during Noah's MRI during thanksgiving. But Star Wars gave us a way to band together for Noah.",1

1705,,"Originally titled ""Star Wars"", and before all the questionable special edition changes... This masterpiece graced our silver screens in 1977. Star Wars!!! The movie had dark thoughts surrounding it, would it be a major flop, this was thought by all who were part of the production, but this darkness ended, when it became the second highest grossing film in America, and one of the worlds most cherished motion pictures. It was a monument of its time showing off its impressive special effects and neat space battles.... The plot center's twenty years since the the great Jedi Purge when a rebellion against the Empire has begun under the control of the beautiful Princess Leia Organa, daughter of Anakin and Padme Skywalker. Far out on Tatooine lives the new hope of the galaxy in the form of Luke Skywalker, a moisture farmer on the other side of Mos Eisley, watched over by Ben Kenobi who has great plans for him. This fourth chapter, chronologically, in the Star Wars Saga remains in all our hearts with such iconic characters like Han Solo, played greatly by Harrison Ford, Chewbacca and Darth Vader. Almost every shot and line of the film is engraved in our memory as we look back on the film as one of our childhoods' ultimate adventure movies. Though when watched with the rest of the Star Wars movies it remains certain that most of the plot twists in further films were never meant to be. This film's just basically a war in outer space somewhere, and the clichéd story of how a farm boy becomes the hero, saving the princess and defeating evil. For these reasons, we've ranked it just ahead of The Phantom Menace making it fifth. Its sometimes boring pacing and dated dialog stands out at points, though we must never forget how this film impacted cinema and sci-fi for generations. The light saber duel is slow, with unmemorable choreography, though is emotional at the end. It's a great film but compare to the next two falls just a bit short....",1
1706,10.0,"Star War's Episode IV-A New Hope, holds a special place in my heart. I spent many days fantasizing and pretending to be the central hero of this film in the 1990's, and from the very first time I saw it I was hooked. Though this American classic was released in 1977, it can still be thoroughly enjoyed to this day by children and adults of all ages. Directed and written by George Lucas, A New Hope contains groundbreaking special effects and fantasy storytelling for its time. Believe it or not, these beautiful special effects that received so much praise in the space battles were done almost exclusively with small models attached to strings. It took Lucas Four years to complete this movie, from beginning the writing process, to seeing it on the big screen. The Star War's series was filmed and released out of order, this one being the first filmed, but being the fourth in chronology. The series continued in this fashion releasing the fifth, sixth, first, second, and finally the third. The all-star cast includes some of Hollywood's greats, including Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and the one and only, Harrison Ford. The movie and these actors received many awards including six Oscars, and earned a total of $220 million at the box office ($848 million in today's terms). However, this was no easy task. Director George Lucas and Cinematographer Gilbert Taylor did not see eye to eye. Constant arguments and differences plagued the entire production of this film, causing the production to fall two weeks behind schedule. Another big problem was the arrival of two large sandstorms destroying one of his sets. At one point, Lucas was even diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion from the stress of it all.",1

The story follows Luke, a waif who lives a peasant's life on the desert planet Tatooine, along with his uncle and aunt in the middle of vast dunes of sand. He is very keen to leave the planet in favor of an academy on another planet, like his friends, but reluctantly agrees to assist his uncle with the next harvest. But when he comes in touch with Obi Wan Kenobi, a Jedi knight living in exile, he is thrown into the seemingly eternal bout between the evil Empire, controlled with a firm grasp by the ferocious Darth Vader, and the brittle resistance lead by Princess Leia, that prevents the Empire from casting its brooding shadow over the entire galaxy. <br /><br />Star Wars is aswarm of assorted characters and planets spread out over the vastness of the galaxy. Among the most memorable characters is the impudent and cocky Han Solo, the growling thicket of a creature that is Chewbacca and of course the inseparable droids, the very formal and eloquent, but quite coward C3PO and the adorable and naive R2-D2. And most importantly it introduces one of the most fearsome, haunting villains to date: Darth Vader. No other movie has left such an unquestionable imprint on cinema, not only from a solely artistic point of view, but also by introducing the concept of a franchise that exists beside the screen. Whereas Jaws introduced the blockbuster, Star Wars truly established it.

1724,10.0,"When this film first came out, a lot of critics were bad. But it really turned out a big hit. (for example: the same is now happening with Star Wars: The Phantom Menace) When I first saw it I just couldn't believe my eyes. Can there be even better story? I guess not.",0
1725,,"This will be forever the best movie I have seen in my childhood..  I enjoyed the characters and the droids and the story line.  Star wars is the only film I can watch over and over and never get bored, in fact when it was re-released in the theathers I remember how the hair on my arms went up when the classic song starts up and the words scrolled up the screen no film has ever touched me in that way.  I dont think there ever will be a film that will ever touch someonenes memories as star wars EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
1726,10.0,"ok, so it sounds funny, but it really is the best movie of all time.  it defined a genre and a generation.  the principals that lucas utilized from joseph campbell's mono-myth make the film timeless.  everyone of any age or race or social standing can appreciate the pure form that the story takes. it is one of the most influential films of all time and there is no other film that deserves a perfect vote more.",1
1727,10.0,"When I saw the film for the first time I was 8 years old and I looked at it together with some of my friends. We were all very fascinated by the movie and we talked about this film every day at school. Today it´s still one of my favourite movies, and I watch it about 2 times per month. Lucas has created a world of magic and fantasy which can fascinate nearly everyone, my sister as well as my mother. They all have the opinion that this film is one of the best films in history.",1
1728,10.0,"Thank you Mr. Lucas for the most important and inspiring pieces of filmmaking history of all time! The characters, the audio, the sets, the ships, the cinematography, the special effects, the storyline, the emotion, the planing, the list goes on and on and on. All which have become industry benchmarks. This saga is the most recognized name with the largest following in the world. There will never in my lifetime be another more influential story that came to life on the big screen.",1

1730,10.0,"Something a lot of movies these days lack. Great story, (a young man trips over the chance to save not only the world, but the universe) great characters, (Luke, the young hero, Leia, the damsel in distress, Han Solo, the criminal smuggler almost anti hero, Darth Vader, the ultimate bad guy, Obi Wan, Chewie, C3p0, R2-D2, (did I miss anyone?) great special effects.(space ships, robots, land speeders, aliens, the destruction of the death star) What else needs to be said?",1
1731,10.0,"What do I have to say about Star Wars? Well, I've prepared a list of some of the outstanding mentionables acheived by this incredible film. -The most popular movie ever. Star Wars has maintained it's status as one of this century's recognition stamps. When people look back on show biz in the 20th century, they will think of Star Wars. -George Lucas has created an Empire of his own, what with all the merchandising.(Star Wars began the merchandising fad that all blockbuster movies have since followed.) -Star Wars has taken the science fiction genre to a whole new level. Before, it was dominated by B-movie campiness with the occasional hit, such as Planet of the Apes,The Day the Earth Stood Still and 2001:A Space Odyssey. But since Star Wars, the genre has seen such sophisticated classics as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, The Terminator, Aliens, Terminator 2, The Fly, Independence Day, and of course The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Phantom Menace. -The movie itself was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director(George Lucas), and Best Supporting Actor(Alec Guiness). Out of the 10 awards, the film won 6. -The movie was placed at number 15 on AFI's top 100 movies ever made. -The way this franchise has captured the imagination of 2 generations can be explained like this; I remember skipping school with 30 other schoolmates on Thursday, May 20th 1999 to catch the premiere of Star Wars Episode I. We had been waiting 2 years for this moment, and when the day finally came, we could barely contain ourselves. Several of us had brought toy lightsabres, and were playing with it in the theatre lobby, an hour before the movie actually started. We had purchased our tickets a full week in advance. When the familiar scrolling text appeared on the screen, we started cheering hysterically, and we gave the film a standing ovation at the end credits. I personally thought the movie was great, but not standing-ovation great. But it didn't matter, because I was already on the bandwagon as I'm sure most of us are.",1
1732,10.0,Every Star Wars fan has seen this movie.  One of the best movies of all time.  Even if you're not a Star Wars fan this movie will entertain you till the last second.  With it's deep background and adventure it captivates you. This movie has shaped film culture.  It's a one of a kind movie.  If you like this movie you have to see the other two sequals and then the prequal. They all add to the action of Star Wars.,1
1733,10.0,"Star Wars.  Well, as you can probably tell from my name, I'm a big fan. But I think it's impossible to capture the essence of this movie or my feelings for it in a review.  Here goes.",1
1734,10.0,"So much has been said and written about ""Star Wars"" that there is not much left. Lets just say that the saga (Episodes I-VI) is on its way to become the greatest Work-of-Art in movie history. By the way, it is my opinion that commenting on single episodes is fruitless. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",1
1735,10.0,"Brilliant story, brilliant special effects, why am I even typing this, if you haven't seen it yet, then you haven't ever seen a movie.  The greatest 5 films of all time... in 2 years i can say the greatest 6 films of all time. Watch them again!",1
1736,10.0,"I was skeptical the first time I saw this film, it takes at least the age of 10 to fully appreciate how awesome this movie really was.  Considering it was made in 1977 this movie has better special effects than that of some movies made in the 90's. In my opinion this was the most original movie ever made!",1
1737,9.0,"OK...I've looked over some of the reviews that are posted here. Some people didn't appreciate this film when it first came out, one guy didn't ""get it"" and others thought it was stupid, long and boring. Now, I am not about to say that this is the best film ever made, but for sheer entertainment value, this film does it. Consider this - in 1977, there was no CGI, no $175 million dollar budgets, but on a budget of around 5 mil, and a handful of unknown actors (short of Cushing and Guinness) George Lucas managed to put together a space-borne fairy tale. You have the good guys (Luke and Han), bad guys (Vader and Tarkin) and an assortment of characters nobody had ever seen on film before. This film was ahead of it's time in many ways. Considering the fact that Lucas took most of the money and invested it into creating ILM and other companies, Hollywood should thank him for reinventing the medium of the fantasy film. People who trash the film or call it childish, seem to me like people who are simply envious of the good fortune that Lucas had with this trilogy...Let's face it - we ALL reaped the good fortune of this film. Think about it - What would Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Terminator, etc etc be like without the advent of the effects pioneered by this film? Next time you watch Star Wars, remember one thing - Suspension of Disbelief. Don't try to pick it apart and spot all the things you think were done wrong. Simply enjoy the film for what it is - pure fantasy. Better yet. Watch the film with some small kids. Nothing beats the look on my nephew's faces while they watch these films; eyes lit up with awe and wonder....These films are what movies are supposed to be about...No harsh language or naked women prancing about, but a honest story of good vs evil that will last for generations to come.",0
1738,,"Yes Star Wars did change the face of movies forever, with the way it showed that big epic blockbusters make money, special effects do as much for the movie as the plot or the acting.",0
1739,10.0,"The first time I saw Star Wars I was 7 years old. The emotion and excitment that a 7 year old experiences at the cinema is a profound one. At 31 years old now the power for this film to impress is still with me. The feeling of youthful excitment has gone and now a feeling of true awe and admiration for the vision that George Lucas had when he created, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A bold statement to make but one that I would stand by. Enjoy this film for what it is, a true good versus evil story and nothing more. Played out with the backdrop of great characters and destinations that hold the viewers imagination. Enjoy and May the Force be with us all for a long time to come.",1

1743,9.0,...but there are those films that come close.,0
1744,,"Cinema is full of magic moments, and as a cinephile your mind drifts away just thinking about them. Thus all reflections over those moments will become purely subjective; who can say if the mirage sequence from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is better than Dorothy opening the door to Oz. But in my book, the most magical moment is to see the Millennium Falcon coming towards the screen with the sun behind it, right after Han Solo hit one of Darth Vader's wingmen during the final assult on the death star.",1
1745,10.0,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Star Wars is the most influential film of the 20th century.   It took a dying genre (science fiction) that after 2001 A Space Odyssey, was reduced to low budget horror films with creepy organ music and made it hip again with it's ""larger than life"" sights and sounds. By borrowing elements from fairy tale stories and western movies, George Lucas created a universe that none of us had ever seen before!   Star Wars changed the way movies are made. Most of the special effects were experimental and created just for the film by FX guys Who had just came out of film school.  Those same FX have now become the standard way of doing things in films and TV. Feeling that sound is 50 percent of the movie experience, Lucas also changed the way movies are heard by creating the surround sound system that puts the audience right in the middle of the action. This movie must be seen in the theater in it's full 2.35:1 widescreen ratio to fully feel the magic.",1

1750,10.0,There's no point trying to write an in depth review of the movie. Everything that can be said about the movie has been said a million times over.  All I can say is this has been my favorite movie as far back as I can remember (I was born in '77).  Every time I watch it I get that excited feeling in my gut as if I am watching for the first time!  Like I said - nothing a million people before me haven't said.,0

I first saw this movie when I was about twelve, and it immediately blossomed a love for science fiction in me that thrives to this day, ten years later.  All I ask for is a dvd to showcase this film, and the all would be right in the world.",1
1755,10.0,"This movie was an awesome movie in it's time. The only thing I do not like about it is that the saber fight was lame. But the space battles were OK the new star wars movies were awesome(except maybe episode two that one just was boring) But in the new hope they could of made it where Luke used his saber a little more. And one thing two charectars never die in the movies artoo-d2 and c-3po, artoo helps the jedi a lot in space but c-3po just stands around and shouting ""oh dear, oh my!"" Thats all he did through the whole movie. But all in all the new hope is a good movie of star wars (because it was the first one made!)I wish they could of made more star wars movies like 7,8,etc, but who know maybe one day they will. Thats all I have to say about the new hope.",0
1756,1.0,"This movie is a cinematic disaster. First of all, the acting portrayed throughout this film is not only some of the worst acting I have ever seen but is also portrayed confusingly because of the lack of emotion within the performances. In addition, I do understand the hype of this movie because it was a very original and unique idea at the time of its original release although the cinematography and special effects is absolutely terrible because of the lack of effort brought in as well as the unpleasant representation of the sci-fi world brought throughout this film. Therefore, this evidence shows the unpleasing conclusion brought within this film.",0

1761,10.0,"Few Movies can compete with The Godfather as the greatest of them all. This movie is as close as you can get in beating Godfather. Undoubtedly, the best of the Five released so far(episode 5 and 1 come close), it takes you to a journey beyond imagination, beyond your wildest dreams. George Lucas succeeds in making a superb masterpiece and I believe that this is the second best movie of all time, after The Godfather(Ninth is a little too low). So you are led into the world of the rebels led by jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker, Han Solo(a young Harrison Ford) and Princess Liea who are trying to over throw the dark empire whose Darth Vader has become the greatest villain of all time. Each and every scene is beautifully executed and the lightsaber scenes are totally breathtaking. When Darth Vader comes into the frame you can actually feel the fear he generates, such is Lucas's direction. As I said before this is as good as a masterpiece can get. A rare one, that too.",1
1762,,"You know what sucks?  George Lucas let his fame go to his head.  A Director should be punished if he/she goes back, after the theatrical and numerous VHS releases, and changes the damn film.  That is just plain retarded. Unless there is something horribly wrong with the original cut (which there WASN'T), you shouldn't go back and change it.  ESPECIALLY 20 years LATER!! That is just plain bad-logic.  Of course, the scenes you go change are gonna stick out like a sore thumb, like they do.",0
1763,7.0,"When I first saw Star Wars, I was amazed by the technical effects and found the movie very entertaining, but the effect has worn off. It is certainly not the greatest movie of all time, nor is it the greatest science fiction of all time. It does'nt even compare to 2001 and that movie was ground-breaking. So let's put the myth to rest here. Any bets that in 200 years they'll still be talking about Star Wars? I hope I live that long.",1
1764,,"This movie created a literal monster in my house.  My parents will tell you to this day, nearly 30 years after the films release, that their biggest mistake in raising me was to take a 3 yr old to see this movie.  It is also the only time my parents can ever remember that I was absolutely quiet and awake for over 2 consecutive hours. The genius of George Lucas is obvious from the beginning of the film.  No other movie in history has ever spawned the creativeness of so many people. All other movies made after Star Wars have that movie to thank for the effects made possible through that movie. The characters are easily distinguished, have room for a lot of growth, and it is and absolutely perfect way to introduce kids to mythology, and the compexities of storytelling.  George borrowed from Kirosawa, The Wizard of Oz, The Lone Ranger, King Arthur, Flash Gordon, and many other sources to bring this movie to life.  He did an exemplary job.  He inspired a new generation of Sience buffs, movie buffs, and best of all he created a film the ENTIRE family could comfortably see together. Keep it up George!!",1
1765,10.0,"This is one of the most groundbreaking movies in film history, I believe. Two hours of non-stop entertainment in the classical style of the 40's, but reinvented in a way I believe no one could predict at the time it was released (1977). Amazing carachterarch, special-effects, story, mythological concept, music, sound-effects etc, etc. The creativeness and technical craftsmanship on this piece of art is astonishing. As a pianist, composer and teacher of music I can only salute maestro John Williams in ""the-original-music-score-par-excellence""!! Together with the imaginative story-telling etc,etc of Mr.Lucas, Williams and a whole crew- at the peak of their powers- completed this epic adventure, heavily awarded and with a brilliant closing. You must not miss this one!!.. Watch out, the next one is even better, I think!;)",1

You can get it on tape but, sadly, it hasn't been made on D.V.D. This movie is great and the thing that makes it better is the rest of the saga! It's so cool how you eventually see it fitting in the story. If you're a science fiction fan you'll love it!",1
1767,8.0,"Watching ""Star Wars"", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, ""American Graffiti"", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really.",1
1768,10.0,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... These words compose the first line of every StarWars movie. Why is this? I have done no case study or in depth research but in my deepest sense of self I feel these words create a parallel sense of being to that of the viewer. This is not us now, this is not us in a possible future. This is something that happened far from here and a long time ago and is told for our own future benefit. It relates to us in the same sense old tales of chivalry and legend do. Such myth comes along with many generations worth of real and useful meaning being woven into a story. Generally however, these stories are only loosely based on fact. They use stretched and exaggerated truth to get across their point. The first line of Star Wars relates it to this sort of story telling. It prepares us for the Space Fantasy that follows. For, you see, Star Wars isn't about Science fiction. It's about telling an epic story. The space setting is a trivial detail in this respect though it is this very setting that breathes new life in an old tradition.",1
1769,10.0,"I rewatched this film while doing a rewatch of all the films. I was watching the original theatrical version. And call me biased, but I think this is the greatest film of all time. Know I want this to be a spoiler review, but this is what I'll say: The writing is great, the acting is good, the pacing is perfect, and the effects are absolutely incredible. Everything is perfect about this film. The only complaint I have with this film is the modern releases. So I'll be leaving a link to the original trilogy unedited. While it is expensive, I can't recommended enough. If watch this movie and imagine you are sitting in the theater in 1977, it is the best.",1
1770,9.0,"I, like most, have seen this film hundreds of times and never tire from it. The risk George Lucas took to complete his vision and the chance with using an full blown orchestra in such a film obviously paid off gazillion fold. I can sit and watch the original three with as much enthusiasm now as I did in the 70's and 80's. As a matter of fact, this was the only film that after seeing for the first time, I left the theater only to get back in line for the next available showing. Thanks George...However, I must say that the prequels, although fit the story line and answer several questions that lingered did not have the same ""grab"". The characters were too deep and seemed to lack personalities for the audience to relate to. I liked them, but there's nothing like the original.",0

I witnessed the masterpiece that is Star Wars at the tender age of four or so, I was amazed at the coolness of the lightsabers, Darth Vader(David Prowse) menacing attitude and voice(James Earl Jones), not-to-mention the heroic escapades of Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) and his allies.",1
1773,10.0,"I first saw this movie when I was 3. I loved it because I didn't know what to think. It is a great movie. It totally deserved to win best picture over Annie hall and best director! I have seen this Star Wars at least 100 times. Now, to some of you, that is not a very big number. I am a big star wars fan. I absolutely love John Williams' score. It has the best music ever. This is way better than the 11th best movie of all time. It is totally the best movie over The Godfather. George Lucas is a genius. He is the best director of all time. But I don't get why everybody at IMDb likes Empire Strikes Back better. I think that it is the worst. It is totally worthy of all Oscars. A New Hope that is.

Overall, this movie is amazing and rightfully considered one of the greatest movies of all time.",1
1777,9.0,"Star Wars deserves a special place in movie history because of the special effects achievements alone. The jump in technology has effectively separated all movies into two categories -- before Star Wars and after Star Wars. Industrial Light and Magic is now considered by most to be THE benchmark for special effects on the silver screen. ILM was formed by George Lucas specifically for the original Star Wars movie in 1977. However, a movie cannot live on special effects alone (see ""Battlefield Earth"", ""Soldier"", or ""Jurassic Park III""). Also, once a movie becomes old, the special effects are no longer all that special; and it is the quality of the movie itself that will decide whether or not it will stand the test of time. In the case of Star Wars, it has aged well. Sure, a few of the special effects look dated now, but the story and the acting are able to carry it. Let's be honest -- this is not ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", or ""The Silence of the Lambs""; but it does have an interesting story, fun action, and some good acting (especially Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford). But most of all, the original (non-Special Edition) Star Wars has MUPPETS!",1

The conflicts and confrontations involved in it are intriguing, and demand your attention. If this catches your attention, you can delve deeper, into the morals and background of the characters.  You find that each person has a distinct personality, one which you can easily relate to.  And, whenever you tire of the in-depth probing, you can retreat and revel in the simplicity of the films. Star Wars is a franchise which has spread far beyond the original three films.  It has branched its way into books, comics, children's toys, games, and the newly developed prequels.  Like an infection, it has saturated our culture, to the point where toddlers run around breathing like Darth Vader. A timeless tale, Star Wars is going to be here for a long time, especially since the additions to it have not seemed to go down in quality; if anything they have gotten better.  One has to wonder just how fairy tales like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty got started, perhaps it was an interesting book which managed to worm its way into history.  Is Star Wars close to that?  Perhaps.  It is something to think about.",0
1788,10.0,"Star Wars is one of the only movies that appeals to everyone. It has a great recipe for success. They grab you with the great special effects and creative ideas, then the story keeps you there. It is a deep but simple story that is easy to grasp. Unlike other Sci-Fi films (Star Trek), you don't get lost in the hi-tech mumbo jumbo. It's there, but you get it. The characters are people you can relate to and they all serve a purpose. The droids are comic relief, Han the cool guy, Luke the golden boy hero, and Leia is the strong female that girls look up to. Everyone can take a piece of it and make it their own.",1
1789,10.0,"I never got to see the Star Wars in the theater because I have the honor of being born the day that it was released.  I have seen this movie more times then I can count!  It is one of the best movies that I have seen.  It is one of the few movies that I could take my 4 year old brother to see.  It has everything that you could ask in a movie!  Way to go George!  Can't wait till May when the new one comes out!  I love it and so does my wife!  Got all the books, toys, and games that have been put out!",1
1790,10.0,This movie is the biggest film ever in movie history. Nobody ever touched the phantasies of the audience this much. George Lucas is the true Master of the Force.,1
1791,,"I can't deny that at one time I thought the Star Wars Trilogy was one of the greatest epics of this era. I would look back and list the greats: the epics of Gilgamesh, Odysseus, and now, Luke. That was when I was a child. Recently I saw it again and somehow I cringed at the acting, and the predictable and universal journey of the hero (Moyers and Joseph Campbell), but if it wasn't for the cool special effects I would have bolted out the door. Great for its era in the department of special FX, but rough storywise. You're better off watching American Grafitti.",1
1792,,"Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope. A better movie does not exist this side of the outer rim. With millions (maybe billions?) of fans everywhere, the Star Wars  saga is without a doubt the greatest story of all time.",1
1793,7.0,There are Star Wars 'fans' who complain about the difference in quality between the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. The truth is that there's not much difference between them. All SW Episodes are pulpy effects-driven space operas with not much originality or acting talent.,0
1794,6.0,"This series of movies are overvalued, also Lucas has the ""great idea"" change the ORIGINAL names of his own movies to ""adjust"" to the prequels. The ENTIRE industry follows his wishes. ",1
1795,10.0,"A New Hope is by far the best movie ever made. It has everything a great movie should have: A clash between good and evil, good special effects, a beautiful girl and a BAD guy. The magic that is Star Wars is going to live forever.",1
1796,10.0,"This movie was fantastic, and could never be passed up as the best science fiction movie of all time, unless it was by another of the Star Wars movies. The part of Luke Skywalker is played perfectly by Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford is a perfect Han Solo, the role that launched his career. Look for James Earl Jones in the role that made his voice famous as the deep baritone of Darth ""Anakin Skywalker"" Vader. This movie contains some of the most quoted lines in history including ""may the force be with you"" and ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" Lucas was denied a much deserved Academy Award for this film, one of only five he's directed. An oldie but goodie. See the original, then see the Special Edition. You will appreciate the Special Edition much more.",1
1797,10.0,"The first of Lucas's greatest. From the first famous lines to the last battle, not a dull moment. When it first came out in 1977 it was a hit with great special effects, now, over two decades later, it is a legend with great special effects. After finding a message from Leia hidden in his new droid, R2D2, Luke follows Obi - Wan Kenobie, aka Old Ben, to Mos Espa, where they hire Han Solo to take them in his ship, the Millennium Falcon, to Alderaan to find Leia who is now Darth Vader's captive. In an attempt to get info out of her, he destroys her home planet of Alderaan. From there Luke, Leia, Han, and Ben go to the aid of the rebellion beginning the story that is known by heart to people of every race, age, and culture. It was one of the first film scores to take people captive, one of John William best. It set the expectations for future special effects and sound as well as sci - fi plots. The acting was none less than any other genre of film. The directing was that of a legend. It took the usual, and made it fantastically surreal. Box office earnings and critics are a over emphasized. Only the movie counts, the plot, the acting, music, effects, cinematography, its all there and thats what matters.",1
1798,6.0,"Of all the films with a huge reputation, this is undoubtedly the worst.",0
1799,10.0,"The original Star Wars is one of the best movies ever. This is not because it is the best made movie ever, but because its simple story and memorable characters touch people. What good is a movie if it doesn't strike a chord with its viewers? This was one of the most successful movies ever because it does just that. All the reasons why I like this movie would never fit in the limited space I have for comments. I just suggest people watch it. If you get it, you'll love it for your own reasons and won't need my comments. If you don't, what I have to say won't help. I think people should be sure to watch all three movies. They are all part of the same story.",1
1800,,"After reading some of the comments I can't held to put down one of mine. First of all, I wasn't born and raised under the Western culture so I don't know and I don't care how the Star Wars movies did became an important role in your movie history. And I am not a Star Wars fan also. But still, I would like to tell those who commented the movie as 'bad acting','unrealistic battle scenes','poor story-line' that perspectives are changing all the time. You can't judge a movie with today's point of view. Besides, the original Star Wars was made 22 years ago. With no computerize animation but with plastic model vehicles. What do you expect from that -- a 3D I-MAX version!!? And don't complain on the story-line if you haven't seen the complete trilogy. It may not be the best movie but there is no doubt that at 22 years ago Star Wars was a great achievement in the movie industry.",1
1801,10.0,"What can i say? This film must be one of the most beloved movie ever, together with the 2 others. I have not seen TPM yet, because it does not show up here ( I am from Norway) until 20. August. But enough about the others. This one you have to see, and i am sure you have, and I am sure you love it. Cause this is no "" Piece of junk"" or ""old fossile"" or ""big walking carpet""!",1
1802,3.0,"always thought of the original 3 star wars movies as great entertainment until the re-release in 1997, and then my opinion changed 180.  The acting in the movie is terrible in fact so bad that there are many cinemax movies that are better acted.  I did not care for any of the characters save han solo and that is only because of Harrison Fords natural charisma.  I wonder if that is why he was the only of the actors to go on with any major non-star wars",0
1803,10.0,"You'd have to be a cynic for the ages not to be affected by this classic. Star Wars fires on so many levels that there's always something new to look out for and pick up on.  More people find out about its magic every day. It's more than a sci-fi cult obsession blockbusting phenomenon.  It's an amalgam of emotion, thought and moral than any person from any part of the world must respond to.",1
1804,10.0,"the movie is still enjoyable today; 22 years later! for a movie to be proper classic, it has to be timeless, like casablanca or the wizard of oz. even movies i don't like; gone with the wind, for example i recognize are classics in the best sense of the word. & no i won't flame gwtw if you don't diss sw at me",1
1805,10.0,"It is incredible to me that something that was as low budget as this movie was can turn out to be so incredible.  George Lucas has geniously combined mythology and theology to create a fantastical sci-fi adventure story with plenty of extra treats.  I never cease to be amazed at the connections with the two other films in the trilogy and now with Episode I as well.  I think this is a brilliantly made film, and it is one that will forever be part of my life.  I feel that the actors made the Star Wars universe real and believable, a characteristic of good movies that is sometimes so lacking. I would recommend this to anyone!",1
1806,10.0,"When Star Wars first came out, we didn't bother to go see it. Very little that was popular at the time appealed to my wife or me.  But when all sorts of people, including one of Sharon's sisters who *hated* science fiction, kept raving about it, we went to see it.",0
1807,10.0,"What can I say, its Star Wars! Its an excellent story about good versus bad. George Lucas did an excellent job. If you like sci-fi, you will love this movie. I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. Every character, every location, its just perfect!!",1
1808,,"This movie is the best of the best when it comes to action, drama, and story-line epic.  The music is as grand as its script, and you build an instant liking to the characters.  If this is the number 2 box office hit of all time, why isn't it and the other movies that follow (The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) on DVD?  We loved it in the theater, and there is no replacing a big 50 foot screen, but we want to watch it again and again. I have, both the old and new versions and love them both. 10 out of 10!",1

1811,10.0,"I hate it when people try to say that star wars is not a good movie. Some people try to say that it is not intelligent and doesn't make you think. I say, if you want to think, read a friggin' book! If you want entertainment, go to the movies!",1
1812,10.0,"The first film to ever fuel my then active imagination! I was '11' years old when I first saw this film and 22 years later, I still love watching it! With the heroic Luke Skywalker, the beautiful Princess Leia, the space pirate Han Solo, and not to mention the two helpful robot droids, R2-D2 & C-3PO...there are no other characters in the film world today that can make you feel as if the world (or should I say, their world) was in good hands! And Lord Darth Vader, enemy of Luke and his friends, was sure to be a household name by the late 70's. 'Star Wars' to me was way ahead of it's time and there's no other fantasy/sci-fi film, in my opinion, that can ever come close to what George Lucas has unleashed on us in the 1970's!",1
1813,10.0,"For me this is the best movie ever. An incredible story of freedom, wars and magic that I would love to live, as millions of men and women around the world, I'm sure. I think that Star Wars is not a sci-fi movie, but a fantasy one. You know, swords, magic, princess, the Strenght, knights... All these are typical of fantasy stories.",1
1814,10.0,"Star Wars is probably taking up too much of my time. Whereas most movies can be seen once and discussed a few times during the course of the following week, I've seen Star Wars or clips from it over and over, read about it and anticipated the sequels (and built the Lego toys I have to admit) to such a degree it may take up a measurable percentage of my life.",1
1815,9.0,"1. It is not original. That's what is so great. It's a classic tale of good versus evil (say it like Mike Myers; ""eeeeeeeville""). It's a western with laser guns and spaceships instead of bullets and horses--an astounding visual!",1
1816,,"Love it or hate it, if you're between the ages of 25 - 40 this film has effected you in some way. Whether it's the memories of the films themselves or the way that the films have effected the films that followed them, Star Wars changed cinema and pop culture the world over.",1

1818,10.0,"The first movie I ever saw was Star Wars. I was raised on it. From start to finish, this movie captures the audience and takes them to a galaxy far, far away. George Lucas (a movie god) has crafted a universe that sucks you in. This movie has everything from the classic good vs. evil to the extravagant special effects (ground-breaking for their time). This movie truly is the ""space opera"" that everyone should fall in love with. May the Force be with you.",1

Listen to Yoda and Listen to John Williams!!!!!!",1
1820,10.0,"'Star Wars' is a definate contender for the best film ever. It has everything a good film needs and more... Story: Classic formula of young boy realising his potential under the mystical tutelage of a hero from a forgotten age, set against a backdrop of a universe which has lost its way and is falling into decay and tyranny. Characters: A likeable if melodramatic hero in Luke Skywalker, a cool and loveable rogue in Han Solo (with hairy sidekick), a mysterious old man with strange powers in Obi Wan Kenobi, a spoilt but very attractive heroine who becomes more sympathetic as the film progresses (Princess Leia), a comic duo of robots (C3PO and R2D2) and possibly the best villains ever in Darth Vader and Governor Tarkin. Action: Varied and almost continuous, and of the best quality, with shoot-outs, bar-room brawls, muggings in the desert, space battles, and samurai-like lightsabre duels. Script: Some of the best lines in any film are in 'Star Wars', containing a mixture of witty repartee, mystic preachings and outright intimidation all delivered with impeccable timing and flair. Here are some of my favourites: ""You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor - take her away!"" Darth Vader to Princess Leia ""Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force."" Darth Vader to cheeky Imperial councillor ""I've got a bad feeling about this..."" various characters say this at one point or another. ""What a wonderful smell you've discovered!"" Han Solo to Princess Leia ""Your powers are weak, old man."" Darth Vader to Obi Wan ""You can't win Darth - if you strike me down I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."" Obi Wan to Darth Vader ""The force is strong in this one."" Darth Vader about Luke Skywalker ""The force will be with you - always."" Obi Wan to Luke Skywalker",1
1821,10.0,"I had the great pleasure of introducing this to my grandson for the first time. He had been watching the pretty darn good Clone Wars animated series and had been asking all kinds of questions. We actually started by starting the full series in chronological order, starting with the unfortunate Phantom Message. Neither of us could make it all the way through episode two and mercifully skipped to the much more watchable Revenge of the Sith. Watching Episdoe IV right after was super cool. Well, clarification, watching the original version without all of George Lucas' horribly executed ""enhancements"" was super cool. Obi-Wan is pretty much the only likable character in the first three episodes and (spoiler alert) watching him killed by good old Darth was so much more emotionally potent having experienced the full backstory. And now my grandson is asking ""hey, how come Luke and Anakin have the same last name?"" Lucky for him the best movie of the whole franchise is coming next!",1
1822,10.0,"Pure excellence. From the mind blowing battle scene at the start to the mind blowing space fight at the end. Star Wars is truly out of this world.

1823,10.0,"I admit, I'm a Star Wars geek so my opinion is jaded, but when I'm asked ""what is your favorite movie of all time"" there is no hesitation.. STAR WARS !!! The original. None of this ""New Hope"" or Han Solo shoots first, Boba Fett with Jabba in hanger deal. I'm talking the original 1977 release with all the bad editing, Han blasting Greedo before he can finish his sentence, and just choppy filming. It's great... will always be great.",1

It made the world look more stupid that ever before.""One of the most successful movies of all time"" OK to that comment I can only say on which planet are we talking about, there are like millions from where the movie comes. ""No words to say"" me as well but he or she probably he said this movie ""this is *THE* movie that changed it all"" and again I agree. If it wasn't for this movie the other 5 will probably even come out but still it changed the thinking of most humans. ""The first part of what might possibly be the best trilogy ever made."" OK this is not a trilogy is a sagaciously or whatever. ""A kid's fantasy, An Adult's memory"" ya probably on Planet of the Apes. ""The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here"" now here is probably close to a far away planet where they what only Dark Veither or what ever his last name was. I better watch The Lord of The Rings Trilogy a lot better and one more romantic movie which for most people is funny that I even say the name because they are people who don't understand good movies I am talking about Titanic. OK that is all I can say about this thing of Space Fantasy about green small guys who says ""I have the force"". That is why I think better just watch it for fun because the movie is affecting peoples minds too much.",0

(the kind of opinion that makes you grit your teeth and smile)  However, I think that we often forget after seeing the film the thousandth time over, that it is a masterpiece in writing and film making. This is a film that brought mythology to a modern form and defied the concept of what futuristic or otherworldly was.  It is not science fiction, though most would jump to categorize it as such- it is fantasy.  It is mythology.  It is tragedy, drama, comedy and romance.  It is human- though often presented as alien- and human at its best.",1

IV (DVD)and during the dogfight scene where Darth Vader enters the fray and, during one cut with him at center frame, you can DEFINITELY see David Prowse's eyes through the eyepiece of Vader's helmet. I was wondering if we are the lucky people to have noticed this before anyone else. I have to give credit to my friend Rita for actually spotting it, but for the sake of the attentive IMDb crowd, I was the only one with the account and so I thought I would post the question anyhow. I would prefer that nobody that HASN'T noticed this beforehand goes and watches it just so they can tell me that they noticed it before, but at the least, lemme know if this should be counted as a momentous occasion or not.

1830,7.0,"So I am a HUGE Star Wars fan like almost all of the reviewers on this site. But to tell you the truth, A New Hope is my least favourite out of the saga. I'm not saying it's bad or anything either. This film is the starter film or ""pilot"" to the whole saga so you can't expect it to be jumping right into the story or the action, every great story has to start somewhere and the sagas story is EXTREMELY long so the only advice I have is to be patient if A New Hope seems slow or boring for you.",0

Nothing like Star Wars, with the exception of maybe ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", had ever been seen up to that point.  This movie has influenced more pop culture then any movie up to that time (with the possible exception of ""Planet of the Apes"").  To have any movie influence a new set of movies (or prequels), is unheard of in movie making.  It really says something to see Star Wars more popular now then when it was at it's height in the late seventies and early eighties.",0

Interesting races of Aline's, Chewbacca the Wookie, the Tusken Raiders, the Jawas, and of course in the special edition the greedy Jabba the Hutt. Perhaps the most interesting of all characters was the supreme villain, Darth Vader. A imposing villain who inspired many villains to follow his style.",1

The dialogue at some points if far from perfect but to be honest, that's what I have come to expect from George Lucas. Also due to the age of the film, the visuals and sound are far from perfect.

1843,10.0,This was one of the best movies from the star wars franchise as it was used to introduce the main characters to us. It is a modern tale of mythic adventure. The movie follows the journey of Luke Skywalker. It shows the chaos between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance increased day by day and the civil war continued. Where the Empire wanted to destroy the hope of the rebel army.,1
1844,,This is such a classic. It has everything. I think the newer ones miss out on some of the raw authenticity of the original. It is amazing to see what the makers went through to get this made and how the studio didn't support them. It is a must see!,1

I gave it a nine because though I personally loved the movie, others will hate it. Those will find it boring through most of the movie, because it doesn't have a person getting shot every two minutes...maybe every 15 minutes but not every 2.

""Star Wars"" is my favorite movie of all time and I am a filmmaker, and the reason I get so upset with people when talking about this movie is not because I'm one of the die hard fans, it is because people criticize for the wrong reasons, you are not giving it a fare chance.  This talk of copying others, I watched Fortress under the impression the I was going to watch ""Star Wars"" but not really, and saw so little resembling ""Star Wars"" I was upset.  It just upsets me when people say things without having thought about why they are saying it.",1

1853,6.0,A fun movie when it was released but loses its edge with time.  the acting looks mostly goofy now and not as cool as in 1977.  Put this franchise out of its misery. The updated version simply pointed out the chessiness of the original.  It was nice that this movie beget a lot better that followed.,1
1854,9.0,"So who has not seen this movie?  All one of you please stand up.  I know everyone has commented on this movie.  However, has anyone been aware of the mythological aspects of the film?  I firmly believe that the Star Wars saga is the modern mythology of our time.  It follows the journey of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker to fulfill their eventual destinies.  All the elements of classic storytelling are evident in the series.  The story of a young hero who fell from grace and finds redemption in the end with the help of his son is a timeless one and will remain engraved in our pop culture for all time.  While some say that George Lucas is a capitalist pig out to show flashy special effects with a ""look what I can do"" attitude, I disagree. He utilized all the elements of old storytelling and merged them all brilliantly.  The idea that good prevails over evil is a great parable in today's world where we need old-fashioned morality tales in an age of cynicism.",1
1855,,"The first time I saw this movie is when they re-released the movie couple years ago, and I was totally blown away. This movie was so great that it has inspired me to see every single Star Wars movie in theater. The original three in re-release. If you haven't seen this movie, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN! I would recommend this film to anyone, even those not interested in Sci-Fi movies.",1
1856,,"One of my happiest memories as a kid is going to the theaters with my father and watching A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. I saw the original trilogy when I was 9. Dad took me out of fourth grade and faked the dentist appointment and took me in it.",0
1857,10.0,"As a young 6 year old boy, I was intrigued and fascinated with the special effects and epic dramatic fashion this movie presented. I was an instant fan and captured a filmmaking bug that also translated into photography and radio production. I not only became a fan of the Star Wars franchise, but as I got oder, grew more and more interested in the mind and imagination of George Lucas. I also saw growth of the acting career of Harrison Ford, who became one of my all-time favorite actors. Although there are many loyal fans of Star Wars who detest Star Trek, as I was when I was young, I grow an appreciation for the ground breaking steps the Star Trek TV Series took to inspire directors like George Lucas. I can honestly say that without Star Trek, there is no Star Wars.",1
1858,,"What can I say?  This movie is a classic.  It came out at the right time(1977)and I don't think any of the sequels will have the original impact.  I think because of the lack of technology, there was more attention focused on the story and, hence, made it a better film",1
1859,10.0,"I saw the original trilogy when I was 8 and loved it. The other day, I went to the video shop and noticed them and went, hey maybe those would be good. I loved them. The film is so ahead of it's time, and the story is amazing. Great costumes, good acting=Fantastic film. I really wanted to buy them and was lucky enough to get the original trilogy for Christmas. I love these movies, and strongly recommend them. The story is about Luke SkyWalker and he feels he is stuck on his Aunt and Uncle's farm, until one day two droids come into his life. (R2D2, C3P0). These droids have information about a quest they must complete, which throws Luke into a crazy new world full of battles, ships and baddies. A brilliant movie for most ages.",1
1860,9.0,"Well actually that was in Strikes Back, hope I didn't not ruin the second ending of the middle of the first trilogy.",1
1861,8.0,Wow!! Star Wars from 1977!!!,0
1862,10.0,"I think for those of us old enough to have seen the film, been involved in the magical mood it created, and waited in the unrivaled lines at the time of it's premiere, the feeling we had upon leaving the theater was like nothing else. I saw this film 9 times during it's initial release.",1
1863,9.0,"Loved the book and really, really hoped the movie wouldn't disappoint. I gotta say, Penn and Cline did a brilliant job bringing this to the big screen. So much going on you can't catch it all in one viewing. The last time I went back to see a movie for a second viewing in the theater was in 1977. You may have heard of it......Star Wars.",1
1864,,"I remember seeing Star Wars in 77. I was 11 years old then. I also remember being totally memorized the whole time I was watching it. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The ships and lasers moved so fast. Star Wars was way ahead of its time back then, with the special effects and all. I remember coming out of the movie walking back to the car saying that it was the best movie I had ever seen. I was right. Love it or hate it, Star Wars is and will always be a part of 20 century pop culture. I am hoping for an original release on DVD. I don't really care for the new enhanced stuff. It takes away the authenticity of the whole thing. To me, it looses its vintage vibe....",1
1865,9.0,"Probably, the film who change the history of the movies. In his time, this movie was a revolution, the beginning of a new era of adventures and wonderful movies. All the Star Wars saga is the reason why we love the movies, and also are the key to understand the evolution of the industry the last decades. One word only: Amazing.",1
1866,9.0,No one deigns that Star Wars (plus Empire and Jedi) are superb films BUT the new additions from the originals just go to show what a total and utter fool Lucas is.,1
1867,,"I'm a big fan of a sci-fi literature and have read a lot both in Russian and English. The reason I'm putting my comments here is my curiosity. There's a Russian sci-fi book ""Tumannostj Andromedy"" written in 1930 by a Russian writer Ivan Efremov. The main character's name is ""Dar Veter"". What is it a coincidence, that it closely resembles ""Dar Weider"" in the Star Wars series, hardly ever because the spelling is too close. I'm not sure when the book ""The Star Wars"" was written, but it sure looks that someone liked the name and used it, but who? I wonder when The Star Wars was written? Maybe earlier, like the 20-s? I'm not expecting your comments, just put my notes to make it full 10 lines of required space.",0
1868,10.0,"Star Wars changed my life when I was 13 and saw it for the first time in 1977. I actually didn't want to go see it, but my best friend did. I can still remember stepping out to the theatre, and feeling like I had actually been to another world. No other movie has made me feel like this since. I loved bring my son to the re-release in 1997, and being able to share it with him. Even though he was only just over two, that kid was glued to the screen for the whole time...and wanted to go see Empire and Return of the Jedi. I look forward to the 3D versions that are rumored to be coming out next year in 2007 for the 30th anniversary ( I can't believe it has been almost 30 years). I also look forward to sharing this movie with my grandchildren one day. This is one movie that will be around to the end of time...a true classic.",1
1869,,"i once heard a friend of mine describe this as ""libellous Nazi filth"". i am now coming round to his point of view. the final presentation at the end (of the medals) is a little more than reminiscent of the Nuremburg rallies, note the visual assonance of the lighting with the nazi banners at the rally. The nazi aircraft project ""X-wing"" to do with research with nuclear fuelling, does X-wing ring a bell with anyone... i thought it might. Overall, decent film, fights somewhat lackluster... not sure what all the fuss was about really, its certainly no Sam Raimi project... let alone a brand worthy of the Star Trek enterprise. p.s the recent ones as one step beyond this ""tosh"" to quote Gary McGibbleson, noted film reviewer of our time (the nineties).",1
1870,10.0,The star wars films are my films ever but out of all of them number 4 the original film is my favourite out of all of them even tho I was not around when the original three came out.,0
1871,10.0,The first film I fell in love with was Star Wars. I saw it when I was 4 years old. It was the first week it was out back in 1977. I remember asking to see the film but my parents wouldn't let me until they saw it first to make sure it was OK because I was so young. They saw it and loved it and took me the following day. I can even remember when my dad bought my first Star Wars figure R2-D2 and the smell of the plastic as the package opened. I have been hooked with Science Fiction films ever since. They used to show the making of Star Wars on television and I would always watch these shows with amazement and try to learn all of their movie magic tricks!,1
1872,,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...",0
1873,,"Watching the Star Wars trilogy always enchanted my childhood which included purchasing figures and spaceships and re-enacting the space battles from the movies. This first movie A New Hope was way ahead of its time and the characters in this first instalment lead us on the greatest ever journey in the quest of good against evil. Before they even added the cgi I still thought the effects were out of this world( no pun intended)and will forever treasure my childhood memories watching this for the first time ever and buying it on VHS and watching it over and over again. Luke Skywalkers character kind of inspired me to being an actor because the message you got from him was you can never not do anything. Belief can get you to where you want to be,realised once the fate of his Aunt and Uncle were sealed. To me though I always endeared myself to Han Solo and always thought he was cool.When I saw him in this for the first time I always wanted to be him. And the Beautiful Princes Leia made my heart flutter even though she was tough as old boots. Absolute Classic is what I think of this Movie.",1
1874,10.0,"What can i say about this film that hasn't already been said? I was 11 years old when this movie came out, a perfect age for a boy to fall in love with this whole new universe filled with all these amazing aliens and characters. I first saw it on television a couple of years later, and i remember taping it all off on to my tape recorder. I must have listened to those tapes a hundred times over as i would read my star wars comic books. It would be a few years later with the creation of the VHS recorder and tapes, before i would get to finally see it in its entirety over and over again. I did get to see the re-release of all three of the original films in theatre finally in 1997.",1
1875,,1. Episode IV. This is truly the first one of the series. 2. Episode I. This movie parallels episode IV. It also gives a glimpse of the Old Republic Obi Wan speaks about in Episode IV. 3. Episode V. Continues Luke's story with a very shocking revelation. 4.Episode II. This one truly begins to tell the story of Anakin and his eventual fall. 5. Clone Wars Vols I and II. These are must sees.6. Episode III. This is the fall of Anakin and the rise of the Empire. 7. Episode VI. The Redemption. Concludes the Skywalkers' story with a beautiful ending. This episode brings both trilogies together. I feel this is the best order for best Star Wars experience.,1
1876,5.0,"I guess this is one of those movies you had to see when it first came out to really ""get it.""  I finally got around to watching it and it's se/prequels last year and my ultimate response was, ""How did this get to be so big?"" The acting is below par (except for Alec Guinness), the plot is hackneyed, and while the special effects are good, they have to carry most of the movie.  The only reason I can see why this movie has such a rabid following is because it has easily-merchandiseable characters and spaceships.  It's most pronounced effect on our culture is to become the bane of all men named Luke forever.  Definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but all right if you're looking for mindless entertainment.",1
1877,10.0,"Whilst films released today may surpass elements of Star Wars, A New Hope, I would struggle to find a film that better defined the new era of both cinema and sci-fi, from the story to technical aspects.",1
1878,10.0,"I absolutely love this film, the sets, the tension, the rubbish special effects you can totally tell their puppets. Chewie is a bit too hairy for my tastes, but C-3PO whines like a goddess. Imagine how much veet chewie has to use to shave his balls. Anyways the action figures are realistic, plus the Melon Falcon doesn't look like a fruit. 10/10 must watch its probs the third best one after return of the jedi and empire strikes back with revenge of the sith afterwards, as that is also amazing with the best scene being where he murders the younglings, i was disappointed to no the deleted scene where jar jar binks died was fake.",1
1879,7.0,"Being quite new to the Star Wars franchise, I have decided that before I can go and watch the new release, I need to watch the previous films in this franchise. Being the person that I am, I have decided to watch them in the order that they have been released, rather than the order that the timeline in the story follows.",1
1880,9.0,This movie is rightfully considered a classic.,1
1881,10.0,What is there to say about the original Star Wars that hasn't been already said before? If you have not seen this movie then you must have been living under a rock your entire life. George Lucas's Star Wars was the first major BLOCKBUSTER and set the standards for future blockbusters. It changed movie making as we know it. ,0
1882,8.0,I understand that this is a movie with imagination being the focus. Nevertheless I wish to point these out.,1
1883,10.0,"despite being a tad on the long side, the original ""star wars"" has everything a movie needs to be great...a hero, the best villain of all time in Darth Vader, the beautiful heroin, and the cocky rogue (Han Solo)...throw all that in with a planet-destroying space station and you have one of the best movies ever...the graphics of Lucasarts are incredible for being 1977, and they add a level of realism that was nonexistent in movies at the time...also, the depth of the characters and the rich storyline got me hooked and involved like i haven't been in many movies in my life...i caught myself genuinely caring who won the battles, and more than once i caught myself jumping out of my seat giving a little cheer when the good guys managed to get a victory over the all-powerful empire...all in all, star wars kicks off the best series of movies of all time, and ranks in the top two or three of my list of all time favorites",1
1884,8.0,"All i can really say is, if you haven't seen it already what are you doing with your life ?",1
1885,10.0,"Out of the over 400 movies that I have watched, I've never heard of one that was ever disliked by so few people despite being watched by so many. And yet, everything seemed to have conspired AGAINST it - George Lucas had to make it using his own money; it didn't have a popular series to be the movie version of, such as The Lord of the Rings; it was made with some of the leading roles being played by virtually unknown actors - and yet, it succeeded wildly beyond anything that anyone could possibly have imagined. It spawned 5 other episodes as well as many novels and comic books, canon and not, plus hundreds of action figures and other paraphernalia. From nothing, its heroes took their place among cult icons like Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. Audiences enjoyed it in 1977 and they enjoy it today.",1
1886,10.0,"Honestly, Truly, no other Star Wars movie compares to A New Hope. I can definitely call myself a Star Wars fan but slowly over the years I've lost touch with the passionate fan I once was. Why you may ask? Money hungry production companies? Beating an old dead horse? Something like that. I won't judge or speculate but in short.. The OG Star Wars trilogy, A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN of the JEDI are the best. <br /><br />I do enjoy watching how technology and years improves the ""special effects"" and character/scene renderings. But through and through, the 1977 Legacy will ring through the infinite years. ",1
1887,10.0,"The movie that started it all. It led the film in special effects, it led the way in merchandise and in Technology. Star Wars changed the way films are made. Star Wars also changed me as a person and gave me happiness throughout my childhood.",0

1889,10.0,"This is the first movie I ever saw and can remember seeing. Excellent, memorable, epic, and most inspiring. This movie was part of my generation. I've seen it at least 100 times. This movie keeps the idea of fantasy alive. George Lucas was visionary in his style of presentation and technique of special effects. He set the standard of the movie experience. That standard is that movies should be fun and the experience should cross all sorts of social boundaries. I have seen each movie since many times at the theaters and am an avid fan of his work. A must see for any fan of the movie going experience.What else, I loved it and still do.",1
1890,2.0,okay so i know this movie is considerred a classic by most people of course but in my expert opinion this is not a good movie at all. The acting bad and the lightsaber fighting not as good as even the phantom menace or captain n the next generation episiode 23 of course. also how come darth vader didn't use the death star beam on the republicans probably makes a lot of sense of course. the soecial effects are not as good as the first 3 movies of course and i could have done them in after effects of course i could tell they were someimtes just toy models. of course. the only thing i really liked about this 2/10 this movie had potential but i could have done better tan george lucas Sign post John Xavier Cassese,1
1891,10.0,"It's true that there was nothing to compare Star Wars with when it first came and therefor it was a complete hit. But it's also true that still today, 20 years later, Star Wars beat most of the newly produced sci-fi titles. A great trilogy without question...",1
1892,9.0,One of my favourite films that stands alone from the series and yet works so well in the futuristic concept.,1
1893,10.0,"There are not words in the English language to describe this experience. Watch this movie, watch the two sequels, and you better buy tickets NOW for the prequels, else you're never going to see them in theaters.

1894,,Star Wars is the absolute biggest scam in movie history. Why?,0
1895,10.0,"To be over 20 years old and still have such a following as Star Wars does today... My hat off to you Mr. Lucas. People may dispute that Star Wars is not the best movie ever made. Show me another movie that has had as many fans throughout cinema history! And if you say Star Trek, May God strike you down as you stand there being so ignorant and naive! =)",1
1896,9.0,"Not only is this the greatest sci-fi epic in history, it is the greatest in all genres. Maybe not greatest (Schindler's List come to mind), but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has to be. It has everything that a movie could ask for. Believable Drama, + Romance, Action, Adventure, Cliffhangers. These three (six in the next couple years) movies also have the greatest soundtracks ever produced by the best John Williams. They also have the most commonly-known, most evil presence ever imagined, Lord Darth Vader. What other villain can possibly top him in presence and remembrance.",1
1897,10.0,I think this movie is a milestone in the sf cinema history!,1
1898,,"This film is a cure for insomnia.Yes a beloved favorite of 40 year olds living in their parents basements.The characters are as developed as their fans social skills.Those looking for adventure films would do well to see the wellspring for this movie, Kurosawas' classic ""The Hidden Fortress."" See this film if you must, but don't believe the hype.",1

1900,10.0,"What hasn`t this movie got? It has action, adventure, humour, and even a little romance. When I first saw it I couldn´t keep my eyes from it although I was only 5 years of age and didn`t understand English and didn´t know how to read.... I was thrilled by the action, the astounding special effects plus much more. I really can`t say enough good words about this wonderful movie. And to all you people out there who haven`t seen this movie: GO SEE IT IMMEDIATELY!!!",1
1901,10.0,"Star Wars is the best film ever made. There is no other film that has captured the imaginations of old and young alike.

1904,10.0,"Star Wars forever changed the way movies are made and viewed. This film blasted through the boundaries of cliched storytelling and tested the limits of human imagination. Like  J.R.R. Tolkein before him, George Lucas, is one of the greatest story-telling minds of the modern age, and he proves that decisively with this, his ultimate testament.",1
1905,10.0,"I suppose I have taken Star Wars for granted for a long time...gimme a break, I was four years old in 1977, so for me, Star Wars is just part of me(I'm pretty sure I only know one guy my age who didn't have any Star Wars toys, lunchboxes, sheets, pajamas, Burger King collector's glasses--and I can't decide whether he's an alien or a communist).  So, needless to say, it's taken quite a while for me to develop even a little bit of perspective on the actual films themselves.",1
1906,,"Movie makers nowadays are too wrapped up in creating the biggest explosions and seeing who can spend the most money.  I am not too sure what budget Star Wars was made on, but George Lucas has managed to pull all the important things needed to make a good film in together, and it makes for a thrilling ride.....",1
1907,10.0,"Star Wars is a modern myth that has a story line that can't be beat. I think of it as a legend. I am sorry though I never got to see it on the big screen.  I made up for it by reading the novels and collecting everything I can get my hands on. I know more than most people would in a life time and I have more stuff. And when George's movie comes out I will be the first one in my city to get to the theaters. Well, I could write 1 weeks worth of stuff but I'll make it easy.May the force be with you.                      Thank you George Lucas, you're the best.",1
1908,10.0,"I chuckle when I see the Star Wars critics using their 1999 movie attitudes to disparage this movie. It was made 22 years ago, before many of them were born or were still in diapers. If they were around in 1977 when it was released they would have found that the special effects it introduced were light years ahead of anything else at the time. Others have criticized the acting, though I think many of them are most likely Star Trek fans. It was not meant to be overly serious, with a lot of comedy throughout and just enough seriousness to keep it from being a farce. It had a message that was an outgrowth of the late 60's and early 70's philosophies that mixed Eastern and Western beliefs. I know I enjoyed it thoroughly and I was an adult at the time of its release and my whole family also swear by it. I don't hesitate to show the trilogy to my Grandkids because the quality of the filming is still as good as many modern Sci-Fi films I have seen and a good deal better than most. The ideas it teaches are those I want them to learn, without the filthy language prevalent among today's pictures. There are few family pictures that exist in the world today and we need to push those that are good. This is one of the best.",1

The stories don't HAVE to be about technology to be considered science fiction, they CAN be character oriented. You all can go to your dry dull art-house flicks and sit there and reinvent yourselves and ponder your place in the universe while the rest of us will actually be having FUN! come May 21st.",0
1910,10.0,"Unfortunately, I was not around when this film first came out in 1977, but I caught it the second time around (1997) and was absolutely amazed! I fell in love with it! It is definitely part of the best trilogy of the 20th Century!!!!!!",1
1911,10.0,Star Wars gives everyone an opportunity to escape reality and to put themselves in the place of such down to earth characters as Luke Skywalker. One important element to a successful sci-fi film is believability. George Lucas introduces so many new twists to old concepts (light sabre wielding Jedi in place of sword wielding knight) that it easily slips into the backdoor of our minds as something acceptable and plausible. Excellent writing and enjoyability for all ages!,1
1912,9.0,"Possibly one of the greatest movie ever made, and let's not forget the two other movies that followed (besides the 3 to come). Just look at the figures and they'll tell you that people loved this movie. Even when Lucas released the new version, he still had fans all over the world to go see his movie. It deals with freedom , passion , love , heroics , pride , bravery , war , peace ... in a way that moves people.",1
1913,9.0,"This movie is the first of the ""original"" Star Wars movies. As a movie it stands on a pedastool of its own. Other movies have tried and failed to reach the statis of perfection and have fallen short on grace. As a sci-fi it is a leader only surpassed by 'The Empire Strikes Back'.",0
1914,9.0,"A movie that bares repeated trips to the cinema. After more than eighty times, the magic still remains. Lucas's gritty outlook of Luke Skywalker and his desert home world offers the perfect foil to the Empire's attempt to dominate the galaxy.",1

I have read some some comments on this movie and people say: ""bad acting"" and ""lousy Special Effects"" Well some of the acting is not 100% perfect, but still great. And, for those of you who said the special effects are lousy well, the ones in the original version were amazing, and the ones in SE were amazing.. and that is TRUE.. So for those of you who didn't like Star Wars, see it again, and try with some spirit :)",1

The script was great, the plot was great, the actors were great,and just the idea was brilliant. There is no way this movie could be better, not a single change is wanted or needed. I love it and it is great beyond words. Why can't George Lucas be our president? He would do a better job. Brilliant. Genius. Good.",1
1917,10.0,"This is simply the best movie ever. The story was great the acting was just as great, Harrison Ford every time he was on screen he stole the scene.There are going to be alot of Sci-Fi movies coming out in the future,but none could ever match the excitement of this masterpiece.",1

Now, I don't collect all the memorabilia and I don't dress up for the premiere, but I do love movies, so just think of me as an avid movie buff. I could go on for hours defending this movie from critics (like they actually enjoy any movie!) but all I have to say is that George Lucas has created a story that everyone loves to watch. The characters are specifically designed so you can relate to them and hope that you are the boy that saves the galaxy or the cool guy with the hot rod.  It also tells us that no matter how great the odds are or how big the bad guy is, people can fight back with the dream for what is right and just.  Bottom line...the little guy can make a difference.  The story, musical score, special effects, and imagery makes this the pinnacle of moviemaking.  George Lucas didn't follow the formula for a successful movie, he WROTE the formula.",1

Actually Empire was the first movie I saw inside of a theater! Perhaps this is why its so iconic and memorable for me as it literally defined my childhood! From the opening scenes where Vader walks onto the ship, to the binary suns over Luke's shoulder....just breathtaking and so very very memorable! The story, the characters, and the humor is what made this movie so great. The flawless special effects for its time(no cgi back then!) and the unique aliens and the worlds they inhabited as well as the worn and used look and feel of the ships and the settings made you feel immersed in this world like you were right there with them on this wonderful and amazingly told adventure! I love this movie and it will always have a special piece of my heart!",1

The basic theme of good vs evil set in the vastness of space is the larger than life magic, that for a couple of hours help people transcend their own existence. The strong character development showing the flaws and failings of the heroes brings pieces of our own lives into this grand epic.

It's all still there: the story, the characters, the sets, the acting, the diabolical script.  It's the ultimate movie and can only relay everything TPM is not. After todays rating of third I still can't believe there are others out there who cannot see this is THE film.  Not that the others are not great but this movie cannot be beaten in any area.  If you do not agree take the time to sit down and watch it AGAIN and again and again and again and again.......................",0
1924,10.0,"I'll be honest, when people ask me what is my favorite movie, I do not answer Star Wars. Why ? Cause this movie is in a special class. Let me explain that. When I say ''My favorite movie is Citizen Kane'', it's true. The reason why I dont say Star Wars is because it should be on everyone's top list. This film is so great, that I consider it obvious to have it on top of your favorite movie list. It's that normal, that I dont even feel the need to answer Star Wars. All kinds of things have been said about the movie, good characters, exciting plot, stunning FX, but what really makes this movie shines, is that its not only a film, its an UNIVERSE. If you are one of the two people on the planet that did not see this movie, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU WAITING FOR ?",1
1925,10.0,"Although alternately panned and hailed for many of the same reasons (cast, pace, story, acting) the truth is that Star Wars brought audiences back into the theaters at a time when they needed to escape and to cheer. It's easy to be cynical and blase about it 22 years later, but it will always rank as one of the best of Hollywood(and non-Hollywood), whether others want it to or not. The line in the trailer for Lucas' American Graffiti reads 'Where Were You in '62?...'. Now people ask 'Where were you in '77?', when it became fun to go to the movies again.",1
1926,10.0,"One day, when I was about 11 years, (193-94) i were allowed to see Star Wars. That changed my life. Since then, I've seen the movie triology about 134 times, and I believe that no other movie has captured the hearts of so many, all over the world. My opinion of the movie can be summarized in one word: ""Briliant"".",1

1933,10.0,"In the early 1980's when 'Star Wars' was available on video-cassette for the first time, I told my father to rent it for me. Back then, it seemed just a good action-packed science-fiction movie to me. By now, I know how it re-defined the rules of cinema and defined my interest in the movies. Over the years I have watched 'Star Wars' over a hundred times and I am still enjoying it more then any other movie. It has got what it takes. It is probably the best movie ever !!!",1
1934,10.0,"what other movie has gathered and kept such a following after nearly a quarter of a century? what other movie is as enjoyable for adults and kids alike? what other movie has such a good blend of romance, action, comedy, fantasy, drama and science-fiction? what other movie has so fully embedded itself into popular culture, making pop icons out of so many of its characters?",1
1935,9.0,"When the Special Edition of Star Wars was released at the cinema most people wondered whether altering the movie was a good idea.  It was as the movie looks the way many people envisioned the story.  gorgeous described the original movie but the new cityscapes show how digital effects are going to revolutionize the way sci-fi and fantasy look for the next twenty years just as the original did for the past twenty. The only criticism was that Han`s character was remade as too much of a good guy [re: the tavern shooting].  The appetites of the cinema going public have been wetted for the ""continuing"" [?!?] Star Wars story.  We can only hope ""The Force"" is really with George Lucas and whoever gets to direct ep`s 2 & 3...",0
1936,10.0,What more can I say ? This film has it all. From John Williams fantastic opening score to the unbelievable space battles this film is my #1 film of all time. The effects are absolutely top notch beaten only by other Star Wars films. The most visually moving scene is where Luke stands on the top of his uncle's homestead and gazes out at the twin suns with John Williams score in the background. Thats a scene that will stick with me for ever. If you only ever watch one film watch this one!,1
1937,7.0,"I did not expect Star Wars to be a feel-good movie, one that can even be said to be a movie for the whole family. Definitely, it is one of those all-in-one movies jam-packed with action, adventure, comedy, and a bit of drama and romance here and there. Of course, special effects-wise, this film is truly a pioneer. I almost could not believe my eyes at first, knowing very well that this was made 36 years ago. However, the story itself is quite a generic one. The characters are quite stereotypical and are not even developed that well to get past their stereotypicality. It is unsettling that Luke Skywalker was able to come to terms with the death of his aunt and uncle, people who had taken care of him all his life, faster and quite easier than Obi-Wan Kenobi's. Another splotch in the storyline is how the rebel army immediately included Luke into their ranks. Perhaps this can be justified by the fact that they were lacking in men but it just does not seem realistic.",1
1938,10.0,"What can I say. This milestone has it all adventure, thriller, comedy, action, drama, horror, romance and of course sci-fi. Don't forget the excellent music by John Williams. I think it's the best music ever written for a movie.",1
1939,5.0,This movie is totally overrated. I don't know how this movie got that much attention and won that much Oscars. The only faculty this movie is good is special effects. In other all faculties this movie is below average. Many children may enjoy this movie because this movie offers some attraction for children or for childish people but the polished movie viewers will never fall in this swaggering trap. I saw some movies from this franchise and was always hoping that something really about movie would come out but it never came. It started like child's play and ended even more badly. I do not recommend this movie for serious movie viewers.,0
1940,,"When this film came out in 1977, it set a new level of (film reality) for all future (space film) producers. I saw this film with my boys, over 35 times. Today my son has done the same thing with his son. It's a great thing to share something that you both enjoy. Congratulation to the entire group of people that created this film and the rest of the series. May the force be with you always.",1
1941,10.0,"Hello JSPR and anyone who thinks this way!! Did somewhere along the way did you forget that movies are ENTERTAINMENT!! Not all movies have to have some underlying, artistic meaning that leaves people scratching their heads. Some movies just plain old ENTERTAIN!!  You go into a theater and get carried away to another place and have FUN!!  My Dad took me to see this movie and I've taken my kids to see it and I'm sure that they will take their kids as well!  Of course it has been commercialized and that does take away from it!  But, the MOVIE is a great FAMILY film that's FUN & ENTERTAINING!!  It should be listed as one of the best movies of all time (regardless of who George Lucas is) for it's popularity thru family entertainment and fun, NOT commercialism. As far as Special Effects are concerned I agree that too much of it can get annoying, but sometimes if done right, can create an entertaining film.  It sounds like you want people to open their minds, but it's you that needs too.  This movie was never meant to be scrutinized, JUST ENJOYED!! -ROLAND",1
1942,,"Star Wars was ground-breaking, no one can deny that. Star Wars was innovative, that's a fact. Star Wars IS fun, that is true...however, I was completely amazed to see it was ranked among the 10 best movies of all time. Those who voted Star Wars as such, have they ever heard of Federico Fellini, Luis Bunuel, Kenji Mizoguchi, Jean Renoir or Sergei Einsenstein? I'm sure they haven't. Please, make a vote if you know a little bit about cinema history, and not about american popular culture or the last Blockbuster hits. You cannot have a good point of view on movie-making if you just know Spielberg, Lucas and Cameron , can you? Geesh, either people don't know anything about movie history or humankind is growing every day more and more stupid and childish. (For Christ's sake! American Beauty is above Citizen Kane, 8 1/2 or Seven Samurai!)",1

1944,10.0,"What can I say... I will add my comment to the potentially enormous hoard of entries. This movie reminds me of what movies are all about. It has all the classic trimmings of a fairytale and all the excitement of a real adventure movie. George Lucas made it so easy for us to fall in love with the characters and this is one of the movies main strong points. The character interaction is simply classic from the rugged sarcastic Han to the bitter sweet Princess Leah. If you have not seen this movie you have never seen a movie in your life. See the ORIGINAL version if you can though, as certain things are cut from the Special Edition. Pure fun for the whole family.",1
1945,,"I have some of the comments and negative views about Star Wars why though very funny and entertaining I sincerely hope the writers were just joking. Star Wars without a doubt is the movie that bought sc/fi back to Big Screen, better it bought ""A New Hope"" to big budget movies and sequels in general. When as a kid first time going to movies, seeing Star Wars blew my mind. Of course the movie starts off in  an abrupt war, this is in fact episode Four, not One. Events are 30+ years in motion. Which add's to the dynamics of it. Why I will say Star Wars is not the best movie of all time, and maybe not even the best sc/fi of all time. Which reminds me in sc/fi they all are good and great movies and narrowing one movie down to being great is impossible. However no can say Star Wars is not the best sequel and trilogy series of all time's.",1
1946,,"All Star Wars movies suck. The only reason why Star Wars was even popular back in 1977 was because of the great special effects. If the special effects were bad, no one would have cared for it. The dialog sucks, the acting is horrible, the story is predictable and childish, and the music is annoying. Kids will like it but apparently immature adults do too. Then again, these are people who whine and complain about little changes that Lucas has made to his movies like Greedo shooting before Han.",0

George Lucas created something sooooo powerful and interesting it just hooks you once you see it. I grew up with it, watching it my whole life, I'm a big SW buff and I love to death. If life could be like it...rock on!! I look up on SW every single day, its a routine for me, I watch all 4 every week. I can't wait for Ep. 2 and 3 although I pretty know what will happen scene by scene.

The film has survived two generations of followers now, if nothing else, that is a great testimony.",1

But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.",1
1954,5.0,"Not bad for a Kubrick film, but I wasn't impressed with the story line, lots of rushing about. However the film looks nice, the stills are better than the film, I prefer to look than to watch. But I still don't get whether it's a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, the setting differs a lot, however Mel Gibson's acting is probably one of the few theatrical highlights. Another thing is a small editing error I have noticed; the ordering of the films. They seem have accidentally made the final 3 first, and only realized in the late 90s, and had to cover the tracks by producing the first 3 in a hurried attempt to cover plot flaws. However, most people have over looked this and I think it adds character.",0

The answer is: the composing, the unique characters and stories, the set pieces, from the ships and weapons to the planets and buildings, and the stupendous effects. This movie has it all, and it sets the standard for what the rest of the franchise should live up to.",1

1958,10.0,"I would just like to say that Star Wars is one of the greatest films ever to grace the cinema screen. Although it's not as brilliantly watchable as the Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. It is one of the most influencial films ever made. The acting is superb Alec Guiness is amazing as Obi Wan and Darth Vador is Probably the best movie bad guy EVER. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are also perfectly cast. Unfortunately there is no Yoda yet but not every film can be perfect. George Lucas shows what a genius he is by creating an entire universe and the film is accompanied by John Williams brilliant musical score. The special effects are amazing. I don't agree with people who say that Star Wars influenced film to rely too much on special effects as Star wars actually does have a brilliant story, the special effects just help the story to be told in a more convincing way. Also I think many people who think that Star Wars is a childrens film don't understand that it is meant to give us something different to what we experience in every day life this is why it is  so 'way out there'. So I conlude by saying that Star Wars is a brilliant Fantasy, Adventure and anybody who says that adults who like it are immature should consider that many adults read Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are these people immature to?",1

I remember going to see Star Wars when it first came out, and unlike my friends, never saw the fascination with it? Basically, the guy in white fights the guy in black, along with the goofy sidekick ( Solo & Chewbacca) to save a damsel in distress. All this with the slapstick character actors being C3PO and R2D2.",0

1961,10.0,"It's hard to say how important this 1977 Star Wars movie is. Its influence is incredible, but it itself was influenced by the likes of Kubrik's astonishing 2001 A Space Odyssey.<br /><br />Star Wars: A New Hope is magic from start to finish (especially the original version that was not yet unwisely tampered with by Lucas).<br /><br />Key to the movie has to be the charm and chemistry of characters in combination with the Star Wars environment. You can't have one without the other, as recent, disastrous Disney failures illustrated.<br /><br />The first trilogy was the great one. The ""Prequels"" were actually not that bad, I thought. They were deeply flawed but generally entertaining enough to be worth a watch. That was mainly down to the Obi Wan character.<br /><br />As for the more recent Disney rubbish (I've seen the first two Disney movies at time of writing) - they are dire, they are certainly not worth watching, unless one wishes to indulge in hate watching.<br /><br />Coming back to this 1977 movie, it earns a well-deserved 10/10 - and not many movies score that in my book.",1

1965,6.0,"In 1977 when audiences flocked to see this film i can only imagine how great they thought it was, a spectacle of visual astonishment, a mythical world full of wondrous creatures, but let me just say this, the story telling was awful, the acting was less than desirable, the screenplay was embarrassing and the plot contained more clichés than troy...but all of these points where overwhelmed at the time from its outstanding visuals. When looking at this film from a non judgemental perspective, at this time, this film holds many faults that make it highly predictable and at times slow paced. Every star wars fan has highlighted all of these points but are unable to expect, the feeling they got in 1977 does not allow them to..The movie going public and critiques alike are all aware that this is most definitely not the best film of all time but undoubtedly the most influential. When it comes to great acting, screenplay, and story telling, revenge of the sith is superior to its predecessors. Lord of the rings for example is a film, like Ben hur, schindlers list, pulp fiction and the godfather that will last the test of time for its outright stunning ability to encapsulate the hearts of its audience and portray a side to life that provokes us to rethink the way we act. Star wars : a new hope is very weak but is not an awful film, disappointing i may say. And in 100 years time lord of the rings, pulp fiction, schindlers list and even titanic will be remembered and re watched, star wars will have died into a non existence...........",0

There is no other explanation. Star Wars cannot be beaten. Only by it self. I just hope that George Lucas will make more of these movies than nine. Please. If I should give anyone eternal life it should be George Lucas.",0

The brilliant man George Lucas has created this new universe full of aliens and planets that people never expected. The original movie, A New Hope, was released in 1977 and people were blown away. Star Wars: A New Hope was a complete success because of its simple but effective plot, the effects and editing of the movie, and also the soundtrack in the movie.",1
1969,9.0,"Ever since my brother introduced me to Star Wars by making me watch Star Wars: A New Hope when I was little, I quickly became obsessed with anything that has to do with Star Wars. The video games and tv shows were some of my favorite things when I was young. The spaceships, light sabers, and the futuristic way of life was very intriguing to me. I even was Luke Skywalker one year for Halloween.<br /><br />Star Wars: A New Hope is an adventure/Sci-Fi movie and it is about a young boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamel) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) who go on an adventure to try to save Princesses Leia (Carrie Fisher) from Darth Vader and the Imperial Empire. Along the way they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca to fight for the truth and go through the galaxies to save her.<br /><br />I really liked the Star Wars Trilogies but the very first one is my favorite. It sets up the whole series and it is the reason why I and many other people love Star Wars. It gives the background to many of the characters. The characters have become very iconic in the movie industry. Darth Vadar is one of the most infamous villains in movie history, Luke Skywalker is an unforgettable young boy who will do anything to help the republic and many others characters in the galaxy. Luke and the Republic have to save the entire galaxy from the evil Darth Vadar and the Imperial Empire.<br /><br />Many of the components of film are done very well in Star Wars, the acting, setting, costumes, make-up, are some of the things that I really liked. The idea that the whole movie takes place and in space and crosses several galaxies, captures the imagination of many people. Star Wars: A New Hope defines the whole trilogy and it tells us what Star Wars is. When people think of Star Wars, they think of the futuristic starships fighting and the lightsaber battles between light and darkness (good and evil). These things are very iconic and memorable to Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />The acting in this Star Wars movie has many award-winning actors, including the Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princesses Leia and Harrison Ford. They all play their roles very well and they capture the energy of many of the fans of the series. The characters interacted with each other very well. The dynamic between the robots; C3PO R2-D2, Chewbaca and Han Solo gave the movie some comic relief. They kept the movie from getting to serious. C3PO and R2-D2 had a love-hate relationship with each other and Han and Chewbacca were the bestest of friends flying the spaceship, the Millenium Falcon. There are a great variety of characters, some being different aliens and people who all communicate and get along with one another from many different galaxies and different looks.<br /><br />One of the aspects of Star Wars that needs improvement are the scripts and the plot. It did not seem to be a focus for the movie or the entire Star Wars series but it was still a noticeable issue. The plot of the movie goes like this, Luke and his friends have to save the princess and they get into trouble. They then see the master plan and end up destroying the Death Star that represented everything evil. This is the plot in many adventure movies but the theme and finer details were executed well in this movie. The other issue I had with Star Wars: A New Hope was that the scripts seemed a little two bland and did not have the effort that I saw the potential for. George Lucas is not known for being a great writer but the dialogue between the characters was boring and dull most times also. You kind of knew who was going to say what and you knew what was going to happen next. Most of the writing though was covered up by the excellent costumes, setting, music and acting that were the emphasis and what drew people into the movie theaters.<br /><br />Besides the acting this is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. Star Wars: A New Hope has been an amazing movie and it will never get old to me. The setting, costumes and acting are the best components of the film. The original Star Wars will always be a classic with many memorable characters to go along with it. As in the title, hope is ever present in this film and with hope comes the force. May the force be with you.",1

Only the Death Star, Only Darth Vader, Only Tatooine, Only George Lucas could have brought such a miracle to the big screen. Inspiring, 'Star Wars' combines the elements of both modern life, and the Space Age into one motion picture universe! Such detail on space creatures, ships and characters is amazing for the 20th Century. The Tusken Raiders added that little bit extra, I think. Tatooine is so like normal habitats in deserts, yet so different. Although, I thought the Imperial Stormtroopers a bit of a disappointment. The main infantry of the evil Galactic Empire, outsmarted by a talking tin-man (C-3PO-On the Death Star). And more could have been said for the garbage creature that attacks Luke in the garbage chute, with Leia, Han and Chewbacca. But, in my opinion, no one can (or should) argue that Star Wars ranks as one of the movies kids will still be trading cards of, arguing about the best character and making fan fiction of in 1000 years to come!",1
1982,8.0,This movie innovated the cinematography world. The visual effects in the movie at 70s were too much!,0
1983,10.0,"I believe that every film must be recognized within its context. Star Wars exists today among other blockbuster films such as The Avengers, Avatar, and Interstellar. Comparatively, it feels dated, yet it still holds up.",1
1984,10.0,"What more could you ask for in a movie with one of the fastest two-hour plots?  Star Wars has an outstanding story which works in 1977 and every year beyond.  This fairy tale is coupled with one of the best music scores ever recorded and a rocking surround sound sensation.  The acting and dialogue are perfect for this movie because nothing like this has ever happened for real.  If more people on Earth understood mythology and science fiction, this movie would be the runaway box office champ forever and even Titanic wouldn't have caught it.  The 25th year of the greatest space fantasy hits next year and it should be released again since it won't be on DVD any time soon.  My vote is a 100+ out of 100, 5 stars, A+++.",1
1985,10.0,"This is the movie that is the most perfect as a stand-alone film out of all of them, and that will be the case until the literal heat death of the universe. It's the one that got in, told exactly the story that needed to be told with exactly the characters needed to tell it, without getting distracted talking about its own setting. It got out on a happy ending satisfying enough that if there were never another Star Wars made it would have been perfect. Perhaps the most visually revolutionary film of all time, and certainly one of the most influential.",1

I recently bought the DVDs where he has on Disc 2 the original showings of these movies, and my goodness. I am not trying to out anyone down but how cheap can you get? I love George Lucas, but he needed to get that movie having better effects. The original version of A New Hope was OK, but gosh it could have been so much better. I love the Star Wars movies so much, especially 1, 2, and 3. But, all I am saying was that when 4, 5, and 6 came out in there's, they could have been a lot better. Although, I admit, those were AWESOME effects for 77, 80, and 83. But I don't want them to look 1977, 1980, and 1983, I want them to look 2012!:D",0

2003,10.0,"This movie captivated me when it first came out, and I still get drawn into its drama, adventure and science fiction. It is the perfect combination of all three without diluting the quality. It is not over played or over directed, nor does it take itself too seriously. No one character dominated the screen and the special effects are still considered to be phenomenal and realistic. Star Wars was the beginning of the respectable science fiction movies. Before its release the genre struggled against the history of B-movies that varied greatly in quality and imagination from the beginning of the movie industry. It benefited, instead of suffered, from the release of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The three movies became what most directors can only dream of, a true continuation and conclusion of the original story, unhindered by fluff and the desire to just shove something into production. Mark, Harrison, Carrie, Alec and James all executed their roles with the most professionalism and supreme acting as can be recorded on film. It is easily the greatest movie ever made.",1

Therein lies the problem. You see, a SciFi movie has to be somewhat grounded in reality; people have to be able to identify enough with the characters in order to put themselves in their places in order to enjoy a storyline about extraordinary technology. However, in the movie, because the characters and events are set, ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away,"" that implies that the events in the movie have nothing to identify with.",0
2006,7.0,"Overall, the original star wars is a solid film but the old visuals and overdrawn ending holds it back from being one of the better star wars films.

I think this is a great movie for the time it was made. It is very good and started the incredible, entertaining star wars series. Star Wars has had it's ups and downs over the years but this movie is an up. I couldn't of asked for a better movie to start the Star Wars series. I would not rate this a 10/10 though, but you have to make a really good movie for me to rate it 10/10. I think 7-8/10 is a fair rating.

2016,10.0,"Star Wars is the greatest movie ever made. Of course, this is open to debate, but its hard to find a movie that has so many great aspects to it, as Star Wars does. A great movie must factor in many parts that make up the whole, and Star Wars has almost everything. An incredible imagination, a gripping plot, fantastic cinematography, special effects that were light years ahead of its time, memorable characters, and amazing music. However, there is also something that sets it apart, an intangible that is not easily explained. Watching this movie on the big screen is like no other, it pulls you into its world. Although this movie changed the way movies were made and marketed, it had none of the contrived marketing that ""blockbuster"" movies have today. This movie became a huge success because of the movie itself. This movie is simply the greatest movie experience of all time.",1

2021,10.0,"Geoege Lucas must have watched ""The Little Prince"" film, which pre dates Star Wars. There is a sequence in The Little Prince where the Prince wanders off into the desert, whilst the Pilot is remonstrating with him, aka R2D2 and C3PO on Tatooine. There is then a sequence where they pass through a canyon, which looks exactly like the spot where R2D2 was captured by the Jawa; they then walk past the skeleton of a large creature, and the editing, in which the images change by a sweep from side to side, is exactly the same as the editing in this part of Staw Wars.

2022,10.0,"The film that changed the way movies are made! A bold statement but nevertheless this is one of the few that by their creation made a difference. Talking pictures, color, cinema-scope and then Star Wars, computer integrated film. I remember standing in line at a Century 21 theater in San Jose for the third showing with some friends (I had to work for a living so I wasn't at the first). There we listened to a teenager who had seen the first and second showing and was going for the third. The enthusiasm was overwhelming. I had seen the previews on a local Saturday night movie program, Creature Features, and the host, Bob Wilkins, claimed this was the movie of the decade. He was right. Now don't get me wrong, there have been better movies before and after, some with more action, some with better acting, some with better plots. This one was a turning point. The proof is George Lucas's fifth entry  in this series - a fully digital movie, another first. Truly the dawn of another age of movies. Jim",0

Lets say two people are watching TV and they are looking and see if there is anything on and one of the people says ""oh I really like this show"" but the other person is like ""from what i have seen it's not so good"", so you cant always expect every one to like something.

2028,9.0,"Though some sci-fi film enthusiast are a Spock lover or a R2-D2 fan, Star Wars will always have paved the way for innovative special effects and trilogy creation. I wouldn't ever consider this film a stand alone film, but for the first of it's trilogy, it does hold up pretty well with layout for well paced plot and character development. The force never makes its true appearance, but we are left in hope. Not only for the power that awaits Luke, but also for the key players for saving the galaxy. I withdraw one point from being a 10/10 just for the fact that to give a perfect rating for an incomplete series would just be unfair I feel. As most filmmakers in my generation found their passion through this trilogy, I am no different and always come back to this film to find motivation and creativity.

Top marks to Mr Lucas for his vision. It's hard to find any fault with the film, from the acting, direction, production values and the musical score by John Williams. Every time I watch I am transformed back to my childhood. I just wish they would make another set of films that follow on from the original 3. I cannot praise this film enough.

It may have been overtaken in the special effects arena but with out this film then where would special effects be today.The follow up films rank highly on my all time greatest film lists but is this first film that will remain as my greatest film of all time, and without it there would a great hole in the whole film industry and in my imagination",1

2034,9.0,"Whenever my friends ask which movie series is my favourite I will always answer Star Wars. Believe it or not A New Hope was the last Star Wars movie I watched. I guess it was never really on TV that much. But wow! This movie had the perfect balance of every element the characters, the action, the plot and all the emotion put into this. Yes I am one of those relatively new Star Wars fans as in I grew up with the prequels (which I do enjoy especially III) but the fact that this movie still impacted me even though it was released in 1977 really tells me how special this movie is. The hero's journey of Luke to the reluctant hero of Han who initially is only in it for the money, Leia who is an actual character not just eye candy, Chwebacca the great sidekick, R2 and C-3PO their comedy I really miss when watching the prequels again. Ob-Wan the wise old mentor who not only teaches Luke about this galaxy but us too. We must mention the villains of course.

It's the most iconic and the largest fictional universe in cinema, fiction, sci-fi, literature, and in our memories. Wonderful iconic characters, great acting (aside from Mark Hamill), perfect solid story, perfect pacing, great effects (for its time), a wondrous sci-fi fantasy adventure with a farm boy, a smuggler, a wookiee, a princess, an old wizard, two comic relief robots, and a menacing villain. How much better can you get? Even if you don't say it is the greatest film ever made, it is DEFINITELY one of the greats, along with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, The Wizard Of Oz, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Schindler's List, Dr. Strangelove, Seven Samurai, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and etc.",1

Everything about it, the characters, the special effects, the cinematography - everything about it is spot-on.

2045,8.0,"This is my favorite Star Wars film because, it contains the monomyth or more commonly known as The Hero's Journey. The others still contain a great story and adventure but I prefer this one. The beginning is great you get thrown right into the action of two droids known as C-3PO and R2D2. They're aboard a rebel star ship trying to outrun the enormous imperial star destroyer. But are soon caught, luckily our two droids jettisoned off the ship because before, the Princess of a peaceful planet known as, Alderaan gave information vital to the rebels victory inside R2D2. She gave him the plans on how to destroy the Death Star, the empires greatest weapon, with the ability to destroy an entire planet. Unfortunately the princess is taken aboard the star destroyer and then the Death Star, the two droids escape landing on a dessert type system. There they get captured by jawas which are little hooded creatures that sell droids. The two droids then get sold to a local farmer, his wife and there nephew, Luke a good hearted, brave teenager (our main protagonist), who lives in the middle of nowhere. That night when Luke is eating dinner, R2D2 escapes, making it Luke's responsibility to find him in the morning. Naturally when Luke wakes up the next morning he takes C-3PO with him to look for R2D2 they find him, when then sand people find Luke and knock him down luckily Old Ben, a very wise old hermit finds them and scares them off. Luke is then happy to see Ben because he found a message in R2D2 of princess Leia, pleading for help from him, stating that he is the rebellions only hope. They then find a jawa transport shot and destroyed because the Empire is alert that R2D2 contains the plans to destroy the Death Star. Luke then realizes that if the Empire found out who sold them, they probably found out who they sold them to. Running home he finds his house burned and destroyed also his aunt and uncles skeletons knowing this there is nothing for Luke anymore on this planet and decides to accept Ben's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and help the rebellion. But they first need a pilot, so they head to a local bar and find Han Solo, a reckless, cunning, sneaky pilot. And his companion and co-pilot Chewbacca a fury, fierce, bear like creature. They then go to the hangar bay where they fly aboard the Millennium Falcon, Han Solos ship. They then set the coordinates for Alderaan and use light speed to get there only to realize that it has been obliterated and a local space station is in the distance, known as the Death Star. They're then stuck in it's tractor beam and pulled on board. They send a scanning crew to check the ship and are easily taken out by Luke and company. When Han Solo impersonates an imperial troop asking for help, two more soldiers come aboard and again are taken out easily and have their uniforms stolen. Luke and Han then put on the uniforms while Ben, Chewie, C-3PO, and R2D2 still look normal, they sneak off the ship and find a room where they can lay low for a little. Here R2D2 scans the ship and finds that the princess is a prisoner here. Ben then goes to turn off the tractor beam because the Millennium Falcon couldn't escape if he didn't. Luke then encourages Han to come with him to save the princess, and Han reluctantly agrees, Chewbacca also accompanies them as their ""prisoner"" while C-3P0 and R2D2 stay in this room and lock the doors, their only form of communication is a walkie talkie type of object that Luke also has. Luke, Han, and Chewie then make it to the cells, and find the princess while troops arrive and know that they're impostors the princess then takes Lukes gun and shoots a small gate and dives in followed by the rest of them. It turns out to be a garbage masher about to go to work, luckily Luke contacts C-3PO and he tells R2D2 to shut down all the garbage mashers, it works and Luke and company are on the way to the falcon this time, out of disguise. Ben finds his way to the control panel and shuts down the tractor beam. And then he is on his way also to the Falcon, while he is delayed by his old friend, now enemy Darth Vader, once a pupil to Ben and shares a power with him, the force a living matter that surrounds the universe, you can learn from it and also use it to move things with your mind, with the force also comes a weapon, a lightsaber, a metal hilt with a laser as a blade. Using their lightsabers, Ben and Vader face off, right as Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, C-3PO, and R2D2 are making their way to the Falcon. Luke glances over to the fight and Ben looks at him as he sacrifices himself for Luke. With this Luke and company get on the Falcon and go. They land on Yavin Four a foresty moon, home of the rebel base, and Leia reveals the plans to destroy the Death Star to all the rebels(Han and Chewie leave). And soon they board their small one man fighters and take off. The way to destroy the Death Star is to fly along a long trench and shoot a bomb in the main exhaust port. The rebels go but it's not easy, they keep getting picked off one by one when finally there is only one left, a fighter is getting ready to kill Luke when Han shows up and shoots it first, Luke takes the shot and sure enough the Death Star blows up Luke and Han then return to Yavin to be awarded with medals form Leia.",1
2046,10.0,"The original Star Wars is a true masterpiece of ingenuity and film-making. No science-fiction movie(except for its own sequel, The Empire Strikes Back) has the power of Star Wars. It is well written, funny, action-packed, intelligent,well... it is everything! Name a quality, Star Wars probably has it. It features the legendary special effects that this series is well known for... but it has more(unlike the disappointing Phantom Menace). It is packed with fantastic characters that are impossible to forget. The story is perfectly developed and the dialogue is always good(unlike most actions/science-fiction movies). In fact, why am I talking to you about this movie? You have almost certainly seen it(probably a couple of times) and if you don't agree with me, you probably don't care about my opinion.",1
2047,10.0,The first time I saw this movie I was about 6 years old. I've been hooked on Starwars ever since.,1
2048,10.0,"One of the greatest films in our galaxy. I only know 5 other films that can stand up to this one, and they are all Star Wars movies as well. Not to mention that this film started it all. I honestly don't know what life would be like if this film never came out. If you know someone who hasn't seen Star Wars please sit them down and make them watch it. Whether you start with 4-6 and go 1-3 or 1-6. It doesn't matter. Star Wars is a beautiful work of art and imagination. I love A New Hope and I think I am going to watch it now. This movie will forever stand the test of time. Long after you and I are gone from this world, this film will still be talked about. How is that for a classic?!",1
2049,10.0,"This is the best movie, the best saga (movies) in history. It blows every movie out of the water. You just can't compare another movie to this one. This is the best director in the world. He made THX which almost all movies are enhanced by. He mad ILM (industrial light and magic). He made the engine which makes the Pixar films like, Toy story, finding nemo, and monsters inc. This is the best movie by far. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as me if you didn't then there's something wrong. Every one in the world should see this movie at least three times. It is the best movie. His story line is incredible. I hope, no I know you will enjoy this movies if you watch it.",1
2050,10.0,"Finding the originals is getting harder and harder to come by. And with Disney in the fray it's even more of a disaster than before. The original trilogy was like the cinematic equivalent of the Mona Lisa... to bad its ""Da Vinci"" decided to put an unnecessary mustache on it and say, ""this is how it should have been."" Now with Disney in the mix it's an even bigger disaster. If you can, try to get your hands on the undoctored trilogy and don't even bother yourself with episodes I, II, or III let alone any of Disney's trash. Simply not worth it.",0
2051,10.0,"Since the summer of '99, the star wars films have had a huge impact on my life. the fictional galaxy serves as a second home for me. the special effects, the plot, the characters, the dialog- everything that a movie should have are in all 6 of these films.",1
2052,10.0,"When it was in theaters in my country, I was 11 years old. Today, This story is still by far the most adventurous I ever seen on film. Not knowing that Mr. Lucas wrote so much about the Star Wars saga. Amazing how we still are swept away by Yoda, Luke, Darth Vader etc.... etc..... And how Mr. Lucas did make it look so real, not so easy thinking about how much technology there was in 1977. The start of an amazing story, and the beginning of one of the most well known movie franchises of all time. This story tells the journey of how a young man gains knowledge of the universe he lives in, and becomes a force to be reckoned with. A diversity in species, working together to fight evil.",1
2053,10.0,"If you haven't, might be worth checking out! All of the actors are pretty worthwhile, and it's a solid story. It's a cool sci-fi picture made on a shoestring budget. While the CGI doesn't look all that modern, it's easy to forgive because the fun story is pretty compelling. The lightsaber moments were cool. Wish there were more of them, but as Elvis said, ""Leave them wanting more!""",1
2054,9.0,"After watching the original Star Wars again, we are compelled to state that this is a must-see movie for everyone. Not only is it still an exciting movie to watch, and a classic at that, it has held up against the modernization of movies and remains a competitor. Amongst the titles that remain on your watch-list, Star Wars should be one of them. The saga continued with more movies, all of which were great to enjoy. Character development varied in quality, and the return to episodes 1, 2 and 3 made for a jerky time line. We look forward to new installations in the series. Drama. Comedy. Action. Sci-Fi. What more can one request from a movie?",1
2055,7.0,My favorite of the franchise.,1
2056,7.0,"Alright, it's not the best of the original three Star Wars movies. It had some rocky starts with some odd looking little creatures in a brown hooded cloak (Jawas), but the story did go much smoother when Luke had to finally go on his own. It was sad to see uncle Owen and Aunt Baru die...but it did further the plot for Luke and Obey Won Kenoby to start their adventure. My favorite part to this movie was near the middle part of the movie, where Han tells Chewey, ""Way to think with your stomach. "" Pure hilarity! It had been, of course that the big guy had smelt something amongst the trash that the whole crew had been standing around in. And the final battle, while the massive space station was destroyed, it opened up a stunning cliff hanger for episode five.",1
2057,,"A classic tale as old as time of a youngster meaning a mentor and going out on a grand adventure! The A-typical monomyth. Yet familiarity is not always a bad thing. At least not when you nail it the way Star Wars does. Unforgettable characters, a perfect musical score and a depth to the universe that opened up the gateway for so much more to come. Star Wars is to us what Greek gods where to culture in the past. While some hickups date the film, for the most part it holds up surprisingly well thanks to practical effects and clever set pieces makes it still hold up today. This fantasy film set in space should be mandatory viewing for absolutely everybody!",1
2058,10.0,"This movie is the absolute best sci-fi film ever made. I cannot believe its impact on the world of science fiction, and it is a stupendous testament to the power of one man's vision and his dream, no matter how many movie studios turn him down. I'll bet all of those movie studios are feeling REALLY sorry right about now, eh? And Fox is just laughing in their bathtubs of money and gold and Rupert Murdoch. George Lucas has created one of the greatest film epics of all time. Anyone who disagrees must be shot by both Han Solo and Greedo while being Jabba the Hutt's sex slave on lease by Emperor Palpatine. This movie is insanely awesome. May the force be with you....homes.",1
2059,10.0,"We are used to using the concept of love as little more than a hyperbolic adjective. But a greater meaning is inferred when the hyperbolic love becomes a presupposition altogether. ""I love sci-fi"" can be a casual statement, but people that love Star Wars are more than just fans, they are a cohesion of people with a commonality. These groups are sometimes manifested as sub-culture. A sub-culture can cross ethnic and generational divides to the point that it's own identity politic transcends the individual differences. That is what is so socially attractive about it. If you don't believe me I encourage you to attend comic-con. In sub-culture, where fraternity itself supersedes all other classical forms of descriptive love, we must call it agape. More than just an adjective agape is itself a phenomena. The American philosopher Alan Soble goes so far as to explain agape as unique in that is it ""rationally incomprehensible"". So as it was in reformation Europe, the spirit of what compelled all high minded conversation, all intellectual strength outside of material need, was a shared excitement in cultural common. Technology, as it evades every aspect of our lives, is so pervasive that it actually forms a sort of macro-culture. We have a digital deity, devoted to incomprehensibly, with all the same rigor of religious disciple.",1
2060,10.0,"One of the best movies of all time. I suggest you watch this amazing film. If you like this then watch the rest of the franchise which contains: The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Force Awakens, and all the movies to come. The franchise also includes 2 television series: The Clone Wars and Rebels. My favorite character in this film is Luke Skywalker. I have loved this movie since I was just a kid. It may be my favorite film of all. It is a very kid friendly movie to keep in the family movie collection. Kid's love it, such as me when I was a kid. It's a film you'll love your whole life.",1
2061,10.0,This is the best sci-fi/fantasy movie i ever seen.,1
2062,10.0,"I love this movie, I grew up watching these films with my family, my brother used to play with the original toy figures and ""direct"" or older sister as they played. To which she angrily stomped away because she just wanted to play not act. Anyway these movies are a big part of my life and I love the Star Wars franchise! My dad and mom went to see this one on their first wedding anniversary! :)",1
2063,,Star Wars by George Lucas was the first film I ever remember seeing and it still holds up today as one of the most marvellous spectacles in Sci Fi history.,1
2064,9.0,"First, I want to acknowledge that Star Wars is one of the few films to have succeeded in the field of space-opera and that will revolutionize blockbuster cinema, perhaps the cause of its posterity.",0
2065,,Yo,0
2066,10.0,this film is the best simply the best but I'm not just gonna say that it reached number 1 for almost 3-4 years and has made more of a impact than any other film MORE games and more spoof's more merchandise more FAN's than any other film before or after it can u argue with that!!,1
2067,10.0,"Best movie, should be ranked 1# best movie.... highly recommend it to everyone great movie changes people's lives",1
2068,10.0,"I actually watched the original Star Wars ""A New Hope"" on it's opening weekend of May 27,1977. I went on to watch it 13 times over that summer. This movie changed my life. I graduated high school in 1975 but had no idea what I wanted to do for my future. After watching the Star Wars movie I became obsessed with flying jets in the Air Force. I went on to enlist in 1977, completed my degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1981 and then obtain my AF commission and fly F-111s and then F-15Es. I owe my life to the vision of this movie and my obsession to succeed as Luke did. Corny but true. This movie helped to establish my goals. I went on to share all the Star War movies with my children. I will forever credit this movie in helping me to establish my future and success.",0
2069,10.0,A New Hope is easily one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. It started a revolution in filmmaking and changed cinema forever. It also started the biggest movie sagas of all time.,1
2070,9.0,"Great movie, ive watched it millions of times and it never gets old.",1
2071,8.0,"Is this a great film, probably not. However it is worthy of the iconic status it holds. The cast make this film. Without then its just another Scifi hit and miss storyline. Don't expect to be drawn into much but equally just enjoy it for the fun it is.",1
2072,10.0,I personaly like this movie the most because it is the oldest and most renew mades of Lucas.<br /><br />The first time i watched this was with my dad since then I loved Star wars!,1
2073,9.0,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope follows the story of Luke, a young farm boy who strives for a bigger purpose in life. After his home is destroyed, he teams up with Ben, and old hermit who secretly watched over Luke. Together, they head to Mos Eisley to hire a pilot to transport them to Alderaan. They meet Han, a arrogant smuggler, and Chewbacca, his partner, who agree to take them to their destination. However, they get captured by the Empire, an oppressive regime who terrorize the galaxy. They learn of a new weapon, the Death Star, capable of destroying entire planets and attempt to rescue Princess Leia. After being freed, she returns to the secret base of the Rebellion to prepare for the attack on the Death Star. Luke, and a small group of Rebel pilots manage to destroy the weapon and restore freedom to the galaxy.<br /><br /> Star Wars revolutionized the film industry in many ways, one of which was special effects. George Lucas had to build the Star Wars universe from scratch, due to the infancy of computer generated imagery, and in order to do this, Lucas created Industrial Light and Magic. Many shots of spaceships and battles were actually miniature models built by hand and used new techniques to fit their models. John Dykstra revolutionized the visual effects field with his invention of the ""Dykstraflex"" camera system. The computer-controlled robotic allowed for seven axes of motion and the creation of flawlessly synchronized composite images. This allows for scenes of spaceships and worlds that seem impossibly real and life sized, despite being small models. The techniques used also adds a more dramatic effect to the movie as a whole. During the scene where Grand Moff Tarkin is interrogating Princess Leia to reveal the location of the Rebel Base, he threatens to destroy her home world of Alderaan. Some time after, we see the planet being destroyed in a massive explosion. Being able to actually destroy a planet realistically using special effects helps us to relate to the pain and terror of the Princess. If it was destroyed offscreen, like it might have been in other sci-fi movies, it wouldn't have been so important. Being able to have these breakthrough special effects helps us to feel apart of the movie and helps us experience what the characters experience.<br /><br /> So clearly, Star Wars was ahead of its time in regards to visual effects, but it was also a beautifully shot film. Lucas wanted the movie to feel like a documentary, and it almost does. In the opening scene we are met with a tranquil planet, until a ship flies past overhead. It seems massive at first, that is until a Star Destroyer appears and we get a sense of scale, its so large that it doest even fit inside the boarders. This scene is clearly meant to subvert our expectations and impress us with the visuals. Arguably one of the most iconic scenes in the film is when Luke discovers his dead aunt and uncle. He then proceeds to stare off into the desert and ponder his role in life. This scene is incredible for two reasons. First, the shot of the twin sunset looks beautiful, especially with John William's score over it. Second, the scene shows Luke against the backdrop of the vast Tatooine desert, this scene makes us feel exactly how Luke feels at that moment; small. The entrance of one of the most iconic villains in movie history is also a great example of the cinematography of this film. After the Rebels are killed by the Stormtroopers, Darth Vader enters. Vader stands out like a sore thumb dressed in all black, surrounded by the glistening and pure white of the ship's walls and the Stormtrooper's armor. Immediately we can identify Vader as someone full of darkness and anger, as he towers over the bodies of the dead. Not to mention the scene where he chokes Captain Antilles to death, and the camera is placed over Vader's shoulder, forcing us to look into the face of a dying man.",1
2074,10.0,"It's near impossible to select a favorite from the original Holy Trilogy, but growing up in the early 80s as a young boy, waking up in the pre-dawn hours and making my way downstairs to plant myself in front of the television, there was a brief period where we were able to borrow my cousin's tv box, which had access to the usually scrambled channels (via a legit, premium HBO, or what not account), I was simply enthralled by Vader storming the Tantive IV and the Stormtroopers in their starkly contrasting white armor. I was far too young to really know what I was viewing, but after watching it repeatedly, I just knew it was something that would interest me for the rest of my life.",1
