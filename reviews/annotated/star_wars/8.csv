0,4.0,"Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don't care about them. They're ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he's proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true.",0
1,1.0,"A hot mess of a movie, with terrible writing, dim acting and clunky direction.",0
2,4.0,"This movie introduced an absurd amount of inconsistencies, to the point where either they purposely reversed the whole point of the first 6 films to slap Lucas and his fans in the face, or they never watched any of the previous films at all. First I'll talk about what I liked.",0
3,1.0,"A tragic culmination of the flaws of the previous 2 films. Whether due to his own lack of imagination, studio meddling, or the previous abomination that Rian Johnson directed, JJ Abrams has wholly and utterly failed to deliver a satisfying end to this abysmal trilogy.",0
4,2.0,The good:<br /><br />Cinematography<br /><br />Music,1
5,,"They are so used to making films for four-year olds that they thought the force is magic. There are magical and inexplicable wizardry happening all the time. Who knew 'Jedi' can heal the drying and mortally wounded? All those Jedi didn't need to die in episodes I-III! If only Yoda had known!!<br /><br />It is not just that nurse Rey is so magical. People fly, people transport items across the galaxy, people come back from the dead and intervene/assist/interfere and the list continues.",1
6,2.0,"As someone who has loved star wars ever since I was 6 , this is genuinely disappointing. This whole trilogy is an insult to George Lucas.",0
7,,"I LOVE Star Wars films and couldn't see this film fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was quite boring. Did anyone even edit this film? Rey's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Chewie. Leia died of shame. Nothing happened anyone cared about. The dialogue was not clever. The film never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of magical occurrences. People galloping on horses (read that again). Magic over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently.",0
8,5.0,... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.,0
9,1.0,"Letting JJ whatever his name is and Rian Johnson write the sequel trilogy is a complete disservice to fans these 3 movies are the worst in Star Wars history. Thank god for The Mandalorian, Rogue One, Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Solo wasn't bad.",0
10,3.0,"When did Star Wars become Micheal Bay's Transformers? I know it's pretty much impossible to consistently follow-up the train wreck of The Last Jedi, but is this really the best they could come up with?",1
11,2.0,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is a soulless film and a commemoration piece.,0
12,2.0,"This movie was just straight-up painful to watch, with so many stupid scenes. The constant bathos and unearned character moments made me sick. It feels so on the nose the entire running time, and the plot is just completely absurd. This just felt like a bad joke.",0
13,2.0,So it motivated me to finally register and add my own reviews.,0
14,5.0,"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.",1
15,3.0,"I recently saw a review on YouTube that made me think about this last Disney trilogy and I almost came to accept that maybe I was wrong and the story arc for Luke and Leia made sense. But then I realize that these movies had very little to do with any of the original movies characters and I digress. How Disney has turned this into a cash cow is shameless, greedy and inmoral. From the very beginning I expected a more dramatic movie, these characters have been with us for forty years! I don't understand why Mark Hamil was ignored when writing the script to these movies, nor why did these movies need a new story when there are decades of comics and books with lore and great stories? Disney had a once in a lifetime opportunity to conclude what George Lucas started almost half a century later, and they decided to turn this over to people who never read the source material nor cared about lore. During all these years Mark H never stopped being Luke and Carrie was Leia, they never took on roles that they were known for more. It saddens me that we will never have a memory of all our beloved original characters together for at least one scene at the end of this all.",0
16,,"It has been quite some time since I got excited about this franchise; I guess the TV shows maybe are doing more at the minute, but for the films there is little to get excited about within them, and probably far too many of them being made for all the 'proper' fan to make it a date. Rise of Skywalker had been largely panned by viewers and critics, but I decided it was a good Friday night sort of film - one that doesn't take too much effort to watch. I was correct because this film really doesn't have much of a plot to care about, and seems to have been patched together without a lot of thought to the whole.",0
17,3.0,"In a galaxy far, far away ... so begins a couple of hours of a really poor portrayal of middle school level science or actually a good portrayal of failing m. s. science. For however far into the future we humans, if we're still here, will be exploring it might be to nearby stars w/robotics let alone the 100 billion of stars in our galaxy & further let alone some other galaxy. And, we won't be dressed, talking, behaving like early 20th century Americans. This film has the same predictable special effects CGI we've been seeing for decades. Same old Earth life comically modified into alien life. Dialogue really dumbed down and made even more incongruous given the technical level of each character.",0
18,4.0,"What is the Disney Star Wars trilogy about? If you can summarize it in one sentence what will it be? You might say is the story of a scavenger girl searching for her origin. But was Ray really searching for her origins in TFA? Most likely her origins were encountered by luck; then denied in TLJ; then forced back again in TROS. So no, the trilogy wasn't about her origins. You might say it was about the journey of becoming a Jedi. But that would be also incorrect since the main character is a Jedi since day one without any particular training. Finally, you might say it's the sequel for the Skywalker family saga. But that also would be incorrect since in TLJ it is very clear stated that family and origins are not important and Ray is nobody. Anybody can be a Jedi. That fact is very well illustrated in the final scene of that movie where a kid without training is using the force with a broom. It's about friendship? The characters barely get to know each other. It's about the constant fight between good and evil inside our souls? The main character is flawless, saviour like, no real threat is summon upon her. So, what the hell are these movies about? My friends, you will find more character development in any Latin soup opera than in these movies. Sad ending for such a franchise.",0
19,1.0,"This new Star Wars trilogy is a tragedy, and the plot makes no sense in TROS, it just wasn't built up at all from the previous movies and is completely disconnected. And this new trilogy (specially TLJ and TROS) totally nullify everything story wise before it. To put it short Space Balls had more respect for Star Wars than Disney, and JJ makes Michael Bay look like Steven Spielberg. So as a long time Star Wars fan i will just pretend the new trilogy never existed and stick with the first 1-6 movies and Rouge One.",0
20,3.0,"I had a thought watching this, ""How did Disney allow this clusterfk to happen?""<br /><br />But then it all made sense (or cents). It's the Disney approach to commodifying our childhood stories and fantasies and turning it into a production line, churning out identical, packaged goods all in one colour. (In other words, the same crap over and over again).",0
21,3.0,"The Jedi who were massacared at the Academy. The Jedi whom the emperor slayed. The Jedi who died in battle or were shot down in the arena. They all did not need to die. After all, doctor Rey here (Bad Robot University Alum. 2015) could have waved her hand, focused, grimaced for 2 second and voila all is good.<br /><br />And no stupid Jedi training needed either. Take that Yoda. Take that Kenobi. Heck take that The Force, Jedi, et cetra.",0
22,5.0,"I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.",0
23,5.0,"As soon as it was revealed that Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, and that Palpatine somehow still lives(!!???), I was officially done with this trilogy.",1
24,1.0,"Absolutely a disgrace to writing and cinematography. Breaks established lore, pacing is horrendous, several things are just left in the movie and never followed up upon, and you do not have time to connect with any characters. It is so terrible that it is not even fun to make fun of it, it just makes you sad.",0
25,2.0,"This and the entire sequel trilogy is nothing more than a billion dollar corporate money grab. It has just as much claim to being serious as the Star Wars Holiday Special does. Heck, the Holiday Special had all the original actors!<br /><br />These people? So bad they are not even aware of their own ignorance.",0
26,1.0,"I heard this movie was bad but I had no idea it was going to be this bad; it was probably even worse than the Last Jedi and that's says all you need to know. Of course, it isn't all JJ Abram's fault for several reasons:",0
27,1.0,"Good, it was fun while it lasted Disney, finely crafted, pricey joke, now where is the real bunch of sequels?.. oh..",0
28,1.0,When I saw the very first Star Wars movie at the Theatre decades ago I got pretty much everyone I knew and his dog to go and watch it.,1
29,2.0,"To start this off I want to clarify that I don't hold any of the Marvel movies in an extremely high regard but they are at least coherent and also produced in the same house or umbrella of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Disney has been successfully replicating and recycling their formula and intellectual properties for maximum market appeal and audience comfort.<br /><br />Yet somehow, after setting off to a promising start, Disney Star Wars continuously managed to fall flat on it's face. And I believe this happen for a very simple reason.<br /><br />Terrible writing.<br /><br />Disney Star Wars has yet to hire an incompetent director but when it comes to the planing and writing they are leagues behind Disney Marvel. (Isn't this just the worst sentence ever?)<br /><br />What bugs me the most is that basically every department but production did an outstanding job. Yes, even the writers.<br /><br />I'm specifically referring to whatever creative genius though it would be a great idea to combine six different scripts into one nonsense show of epic proportions. They actually utter the words: ""Somehow Palpatine returned.""<br /><br />That's the sound of the screenwriter giving up.<br /><br />As inexplicably as he comes back though, he dies, again, equally inexplicably.<br /><br />And if you think you have an answer for how or why events took place the way they did without saying ""The Force done did it."" I'll become your very own personal slave.<br /><br />This movie doesn't have plot-holes it has plot-craters.<br /><br />I'm sure all this made sense at some point until they microwaved it, froze it, microwaved it again, toasted it and garnished it with weapons grade uranium.<br /><br />That's what people like right?<br /><br />I'm not saying you actually couldn't enjoy yourself, after all maybe you really don't care about anything making any sense at all. Maybe you're just here for the spectacle.<br /><br />In that way you could almost call this movie fine, if pretty bloated.<br /><br />But I'm not trying to spoil your fun. I'm just one of those annoying snobs that holds the art-form of film-making in high regard.<br /><br />Anyways, worst Star Wars film with the obvious exception being the Holiday Special.<br /><br />Let's just keep talking though.. since I have barely touched on the Disney Marvel comparison yet, let's give that a go.<br /><br />Marvel has characters with character. Not all of them, for sure, and mostly it's pretty shallow, but it's absolutely there. Disney Star Wars doesn't have that. They have place holders. People who eventually will do something once the writers figure out who they are. With Fin probably being the least consistent. So essentially we get the copies of the old cast in feel and look and the literal old cast on top. Nobody is allowed any agency or character traits that weren't previously popular unless they are contemporarily popular.<br /><br />Which serves a single function: Making the moneys.<br /><br />Marvel is making quite a lot more money though, which brings me back to the<br /><br />How?-Factor. How could they mess up so bad?<br /><br />Aren't there already a mass of popular Star Wars books and comics and what not. Is it really important to the Star Wars experience to see the old cast again?<br /><br />Actually no.. Even though the George Lucas Star Wars prequels are dreadful, they went with a completely different story approach and still made a ton of cash especially in the merchandise department. What this shows is that there is no need to weasel people in with the sweet taste of nostalgia. Returning to the Star Wars universe is enough as long as you're actually telling an interesting cohesive story. The Last Jedi had the most meat on it's bone but I want to believe after getting upset with the producers, Ryan Johnson just wrote a bunch of twists and turns specifically designed to render his own movie and the Star Wars - Recycling Project as a whole null and void. Seriously the last 20 minutes of that movie basically make fun of the previous two hours. If this actually was a giant troll-move it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The rest of Disney Star Wars is not even worth mentioning as all other entries are painfully mediocre. Just 90 - 120 minutes of nothing much.<br /><br />Most notably the Rise of Skywalker has solidified this latest trilogy as subjectively worse than the prequels. Those may be technically inferior in almost every aspect but they had a far more reaching and superior cultural impact.<br /><br />Finally, the Rise of Skywalker almost classifies as a ""So bad it's good""-Movie if it wasn't far all the wasted potential on display.",0
30,2.0,"A terrible movie for Star Wars, cinema or art fans.<br /><br />It crushes the force and takes Mary Sue-ism and unexplained occurrences to a new height. Frankly, and we have known this all along, the actors and actresses are poor.",0
31,4.0,"TROS combines the obvious, simplistic conclusion to an arc that Return of the Jedi had with rushed and emotionless attempts at character development. I think when evaluating the sequel trilogy, the issue of a lack of a consistent narrative across the trilogy hurts all three films in the larger story, so I mostly consider each film on its own merits. Each of them and the trilogy would have been much better off with a single writer and vision of the direction the trilogy should go, but since we didn't have that, each movie should just be judged on its own merits. On those grounds, The Rise of Skywalker fails to convince the audience of its character arcs or generate any investment in the inevitable outcome. Rey is severely underwritten, as we don't know to what extent she's really tempted by the Sith or her reasons for and against; all we get is fear of a vision and her family backstory. Kylo had a crucial arc in the previous film which was promptly thrown out the window here in favor of literally the same arc, just done worse. Once again he is told by a higher power to kill Rey, and while he initially tries to turn her, he eventually sides with her. We get a bizarre scene with Han where Kylo is sad and apparently coming around, but it rings hollow because we've seen it before and none of the reasons behind the turn this time are shown. Plenty of plot points don't make sense (how does Palpatine return? lazy writing anyways; how does Rey using a second light saber give her the upper hand? Why doesn't she have all the Sith rush into her as she was assured would happen moments before?), but even beyond that, no emotional beats in the film hit because it's all so contrived. This film feels most on the side of personal rather than true galactic stakes, as we only see effects on others when all the ships come in at the end, and those personal stakes never feel real because of the inevitability of the ending. The Rey/Kylo romance felt really strange, death is toyed with repeatedly for no reason (Chewbacca, Palpatine, Rey, and that girl Poe is into are all examples of this), and Rey going to Tattooine and calling herself Skywalker was the perfect nonsensical bow on top of the absurd film. I think some of the directions they try to take the movie are reasonable, but are poor choices given the decision to retcon the previous film and how little time they have to build different character arcs. Rather than build on VIII or set more realistic character goals for this one, they went all in and made a film that's hollow from start to finish. While it's representative of the disjointed trilogy overall, it's a shame that such a beloved franchise ended so underwhelmingly.",0
32,2.0,News that is. Very good news.<br /><br />It is the last one. We don't have to see this cast and crew again (until sequel time in 2021).,1
33,2.0,"So... here's the summary: Palpatine is back, somehow, with a fleet of planet killing Stardestroyers, as if we weren't tired of those already. He decides to have them in the First Order so he can take over the Galaxy again.",0
34,1.0,I laughed out loud when I read the text crawl at the Beginn because I saw it leaked before and thought it was fake because it sounded so stupid.,0
35,1.0,In this film:,0
36,1.0,This is perhaps the last in a long line of crapola films by george lucas who made a real killing on the proceeds about a galaxy far far away ... there is nothing of value in any of these films except a lesson in how to avoid being trapped in a big budget film that never ends yet collects millions of dollars for doing nothing,0
37,2.0,Or yet another Ghostbusters!,0
38,5.0,"The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace.",0
39,,"Embarrassing<br /><br />If there was a lower rating than 1, this film would deserve it. Was this written by a remedial Sunday school class? The rise (hahahaahaaaaa) is a selfish, stupid, and harmful film. If this movie was satire and called ""Bulls**t"", I would still give it a ZREO for even giving screen time to this nonsense. Geez... really, humans.",0
40,1.0,"Does this even qualify as a movie? Yes, the images move at twenty-four frames a second, but as a story, this is the biggest mess I have ever seen, a mishmash of Macguffins, convenient idiocy to move the plot along, and new flashy Force powers to comb away problems when they arise and the writer cannot come up with a more clever resolution. All the actors seem checked out and I cannot blame them: it's like every movie in this misbegotten trilogy, rather than building on the movie before it, just wants to press the reset button over and over. How can you play a character that way?",0
41,5.0,Positives:<br /><br />,0

43,4.0,"Don't watch this. Its like a transformers movie, just exsisting to sell toys.",0
44,5.0,"After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case.",0
45,1.0,It's almost like a 7 year old wrote the storyline to this film.,0
46,1.0,"This was just rubbish, totally trashed the Star Wars storyline. So basically the palpatine name wiped out the skywalker line and assumed the skywalker name in the end. Just complete junk.....I cannot believe this movie is rated so well. The 3 new Star Wars that came out totally ruined the franchise. The story is terrible, it's too rushed, and just does not have the Star Wars feel. It would have been infinitely better if Rey had actually been a skywalker, but no she's a flipping palpatine!!Palpatine!!! Complete garbage, these episodes need to be forgotten, and Disney needs to go back to the drawing board and get Lucas to direct them again. I mean, they had all the books there that could have drawn from, people would have been immensely happy had they just gone by what's already there, and built off of that, but no, They went off on their own stupid, ridiculous ideas that make no sense and, make it feel like every other trash, empty Hollywood blockbuster that has ever come out. COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0

Why would he wait to rise again to give up all his power by saying ""kill me"". So much trying to fix Ep 8...THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT MAKE AN OVER ARCHING STORY FOR THE TRILOGY. MOVIE MAKING 101. WRITE YOUR STORY. THIS TRILOGY IS A MESS AND BACKED JJ INTO A CORNER & NOW WE END UP WITH AN AWFUL FINALE FOR A 40 YEAR SAGA. Characters are dropped from Ep 8, irrelevant new characters. Hated her saying Rey Skywalker & Ben/Rey kiss....Just SO disappointed. Only thing K Kennedy has done I've liked is Mandalorian and Rogue One, her trilogy is AWFUL. MAKE A PLAN WHEN ATTEMPTING A TRILOGY.",0
48,,Watching this Disney film makes me notice that the titles are nonsense. Where do they get these titles from? In the first one the force does not awaken. mostly because it is inconsistent with the force. It is always there and never sleeps. In the next one we do not have a last jedi or the series would have ended. And here all Skywalkers are dead. Rey trying to fit herself is laughable of course.,0

58,3.0,"I'm not sure wether it's worse or better than Episode VIII. This movie is just utter chaos. Pretty much every scene is created for spectacle or heavy-handed characterization.

64,1.0,A big thanks to Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley for getting me trough this new trilogy. Not that it felt like a trilogy or a complete story arc.

65,,"6.7?? Should be 1.7.<br /><br />I am very sad to see this movie was not any good. People who rated this movie above 4 just don't have heart nor have common sense, in other terms: cast and crew. Bad Robot interns.",1
66,2.0,"This movie makes no sense. The story jumps from McGuffin to McGuffin, things just happen randomly to keep the movie going and the plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Finn, one of the main characters of the first sequel movie, is now basically an extra and it's sad to see him reduced to a delivery machine for bad jokes. Don't think so? Well, John Boyega does. This is basically a bad fan fiction with Jar Jar Abrams desperately trying to fix Rian Johnson's middle finger to the Star Wars fans, unfortunately he fails miserably. After mastering every single Jedi skill without ever hearing of it and beating an experienced user of the dark side with ease, Rey Sue can now heal and revive people with the force - maybe she should do the same to Disney's Star Wars. Avoid this movie if you are a Star Wars fan and enjoy good story telling in general. Watch it if you don't care about Star Wars but are easily entertained. If coherent plot, respectful handling of your favorite characters and logic aren't your thing you can definitely find joy in the excellent CGI, cinematography and mostly good acting. We've come to a point where computer animations are so stunning that they make people believe they were watching something good - just look at the massive success of the Transformers movies. At least they didn't turn Optimus Prime into a hermit that lost all his positive vibes and just wants the Decepticons to win while drinking green milk directly from some alien tiddys.",0

The childs creation has all the right pieces but no finished product. And that's how I feel about the Star Wars IX, I'm like the parent, I'm disappointed.

75,5.0,"Having witnessed TROS a week ago and realising that it required a moment to process, I went about re-watching its predecessors. I had never really registered the prequels as anything more than schlocky fun, but putting myself into the shoes of ardent fans waiting with baited breath at the turn of the century, TPM becomes more than just a disappointment. The political discourse aims for complexity but its conflicts are resolved with laser swords, the dialogue's delivery gives a fresh meaning to the word monotone, the ethnic stereotypes are at best irritating, and the visual effects are downright ugly. While the podracing sequence has aged relatively well, it's symptomatic of another issue - whoever thought it was a good idea to devote an entire third of Vader's origin story to his dopey pre-teen self? No matter his midichlorian count, the plot itself is inconsequential; the galaxy lies in precarious balance between the light side and the dark, but here he is playing with action figures.",0

There needs to be 27% action, 23% humor, 15% suspense, 18% romance, 19% nostalgia etc. We need to get the old fans back, and we need to lure new and young ones in.

There's nothing like the Star Wars series. Episode IX is the final chapter that has a conclusion to the story that is over 40 years of a making. At the beginning of 1977's Star Wars: A New Hope, these are all the story of all 8 Star Wars films to get to Episode IX that is the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, it has to be Inevitable, Satisfying, Emotional, and Thrilling. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas wants the whole world to see what it's like to feel the ending of Star Wars, as the force will call to us, between the light and the dark side, and we will all feel the force once again. All the main characters and the original characters come together for one very last time for the final saga to end, and it's like nothing you've ever seen before. The previous story of Star Wars have all build and lead to this very last moment. It will go out with a bang, and there is a massive energy to it, that's bigger than anything that I could ever imagine. And it has all the fun.

Unfortunately, many fans became needlessly upset with the most trivial and pointless things in ""The Last Jedi."" I don't think that that movie was perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that the internet reaction to it was complete overkill. Due to the mixed fan reaction, Disney and Lucasfilm decided to go all-out in trying to appeal to all factions of this divided fanbase in the finale to their new trilogy. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" takes everything interesting that was set up in the previous two films, needlessly tosses it aside, and gives us a regurgitation of ""Return of the Jedi"" with elements from other ""Star Wars"" movies. It is completely over-the-top, nonsensical, and pretty much destroys any of the enjoyment that I had gotten out of this trilogy in the first place.

99,1.0,"How one feels about The Last Jedi (the best Star Wars film) is going to greatly color what one thinks about this film. The film does everything it could to try to undermine that far, far superior film. In doing so this film undermines the entire series AND is just boring on its own merits. Johnson made a certain set of choices-largely around Rey's story-that should either been left alone or Disney should have insisted that Johnson make the choices Abrams does here. If Rey's parents were revealed to be ""special"" in TLJ it would have been lame but structurally correct in the trilogy. That so much of Rise is built around revealing who Rey's *real* parents were the film ends up treading water. That issue was resolved. The resolution that Johnson selected was utterly brilliant-why on earth must everyone be related? Abrams' retcon is unneeded, uninteresting and in this zeitgeist abhorrent. To insist that a hero must have special blood is disgusting especially given that the country is dealing with a resurgent far right. The script twist itself into pretzels to try to satisfy as many fan theories as possible; Rey ends up as sort of the offspring of two powerful families, including being in a way a Skywalker. All this film does is turn Rey's story into Luke's. We have seen that. Can we *please* have something different?",0

This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile.",1

The same can be said for this movie in parts. Even the Actors seem to be confused in this movie as the acting looks forced As can be seen in their facial expressions. To be fair I know Rian Johnston got slated for The Last Jedi but his vision was above par and the acting was a lot more solid in that movie, in fact I would rate it much higher than that of JJ's efforts. I just wish Rian had got to finish this Saga as I think his vision would have been better than that of JJ's. To finish this Movie is worth it to go and see, but you probably won't want to see it a second time which in my opinion doesn't make for a great movie. As for JJ, I think he has fallen and lost his way because what should have great turned into a confused average movie.",0
102,3.0,"Without a doubt The Rise Of Skywalker is the worst Star Wars movie cause while The Last Jedi killed Star Wars TROS spit on its grave. Bringing back Palpatine only solidified that Disney and JJ Abrams had no plan. It showed no respect of Anakin's redemption at the end of Return of the Jedi by having Rey to destroy Palpatine. The whole plot was stupid in trying to locate Palpatine. It was obvious that Kathleen Kennedy used Luke, Leia and Han only to make it hard to retcon the Sequel Trilogy. Poe and Finn was made to be used as pawns to make Rey a Mary Sue.",0
103,6.0,"It's clear now that this film franchise was doom from the start when Disney buy out Lucasfilm. Nobody had a clue how to further tell the story. So, director JJ Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy closely just rehash the same formulaic tropes of the original trilogy again with a few lazy reconstructing twists. They didn't even bother using with any of the establishing lore from books that could had made the films seen somewhat unique and new. Look, as much as people hate the prequels. At least, they gave us somewhat of a beginning tale that somewhat fit into the continuous story of the originals. As for these sequel series, they really do hurt most of the canon lore. This movie being the worst. It ruined the whole Skywalker redemption arch by having Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) return with yet again with the over clichés easy to pick off out of nowhere planet killing ships rather than going all in with more complex well-acted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). It also gave the whole Chosen One prophecy to somebody else. Perhaps the biggest let down in the movie was finding out that semi alright Rey (Daisy Ridley) does indeed have a grand gifted lineage rather than the idea that great power within the Force can manifest in anyone. Don't get me wrong, having Rey be related to the real villain is not a bad idea. It just shouldn't be biological parental because it's a bit off putting that somebody pork her grandfather. Instead she should be one of the many female Sith cultist clones that was model after Sidious including trailer fodder Darth Rey. Emperor Palpatine that died previous should be the male clone also separate from Sidious. It would better explain why the ancient dark lord look like in bad shape as he made copies upon copies of himself over time and why he can heal himself back once a clone like Rey dies. As for the old Supreme Leader. I would love to think that the reason why he looks rough was because he was one of the very few copies of the demise Darth Plagueis. It can explain why Sidious was able to gain control of him so easily. All this would make more sense than what the film gave us. Another thing that was disappointing is having Ren work with Sidious and Rey trying to burn the lightsaber. It dropped the ball with Rey's beliefs of preserving the past to gain knowledge and strength was counterpart to Kylo's wants to destroy it as he felt that it binds people to weakness and ignorance. The film also ignored their dyadic idealistic understanding that future peace can only be made with the meager of the cookie cutter light and the dark side of the force into the grey area way. It sucks. Also having Rey fall in love with the man that killed all her mentors is an unhealthy forced romantic relationship. Such a turn off more than the last movie. That was one thing that should had been retcon! At least Abrams keep the good thing about their communicate. The idea that they can move items through their mental and physical force powers despite not being in the same location was cool to witness even if it never established or used in the original or prequel series. Yet the used age of the new half-baked force healing was not well done. It makes demise seem like a game of hot potato. Likewise, if the force can straight up heal people and even bring them back from near death. Why would Jedis forbid the practice? It sounds like they could had saved the universe all this problem if they taught a certain Skywalker how to do it many moons ago. To add onto that the idea that most of the dead Jedis would be alright in helping Rey rather than any of the previous heroes like Luke (Mark Hamill) is such a cop out. She is more prone to use her anger and fear. Also, the idea that Sidious is able to use all the powers of all the Sith to knock out all the whole fleet through force lightning is over the top silly more than the Holdo maneuver, not only because every dark lord in the past has betrayed each other but as well their long history belief to limited their numbers to a very few. It makes no sense. Along with that, the whole 16 hours ancient Sith dagger wayfinder fetch quest really felt like wasted nonsense filler. The idea that the blade edge lines up perfectly with still surprising mostly intact wreckage of the Death Star was outrageous dumb luck seeing how the explosion burn it up nor the tough waters eroded the metal over time. The story pacing is kinda hard to believe like Rey fixing Luke's old ship in a few hours after years being underwater. It kinda like how they never explain how Maz Kanata voiced by Lupita Nyong'o got a hold with Luke's old lightsaber or what Finn (John Boyega) had to say to Rey. It's really bad editing. While the performers are great, their characters are wasted along with less annoying Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Also, the death of Carrie Fisher in late 2016 caused major problems in production as well. The repurpose unused footage of Leia was kinda jarring. The visual/special effects from ILM were still impressive along with the sets & costume but some of the action scenes does cause dangerous photosensitive epilepsy. Not good. At least the film score by John Williams was still amazing. Overall: This movie is a mess from start to the cheesy name changing finish. I can't act like the previous two were perfect, but this seems especially maclunkey. I didn't like it. At least 'the Mandalorian' TV show is giving new hope for Star Wars because this movie certainly tries to kill it.",0
104,5.0,"Upon my original 8/10 review - Just did a tripple bill topped with a midnight screening. Blimey! Anyway, I hated The Last Jedi at what I promised would be my LAST midnight screening, and although movies this late are spoiled by the timing of these midnight screening things, this one managed to keep me stoked. Actually finishes the whole saga off very nicely. The handling of the Carrie Fisher difficulty was quite good, considering they just wrote new dialogue around scenes cut from the first film in this trilogy, rather than CGI ing her in. A little forced, but for the most part worked. It's probably something of an 8/10, maybe more. They introduced a rather spectacular dark side aspect that I wish they gave a little more time to breath. Another positive that came out of this one is that it ties on to The Last Jedi quite well. I felt the Last Jedi ended up messing things set up in the first one, in the hands of another writer, but feel differently about that middle chapter now.",0

128,5.0,"Well, it's all done now. Skywalker. Vader. Palpatine. Except you know it really isn't. Since Star Wars is now a franchise and a brand and a 11 movie mega-mess, you know it'll never end. As entertainment, this was an engaging movie. It wraps up the threads started in the last two movies, yet it probably won't stay with you. Nothing here is new or super creative, although they'll keep your brain busy for 2 and a half hours. Many plot points feel hornshoed in, or attempts to retcon previous movies to explain what happens in this one (ie. Palpatine). Yet, if you're like me, you stopped caring about all the explanations and reasons a long time ago. Starting with The Force Awakens it was pretty clearly established that any logic you may think you know about the Star Wars universe isn't going to be used. And that even simple movie techniques (like C3P0 losing his memory) aren't going be permanant or meaningful. And that's the problem with this film and all the new trilogy films - it doesn't really matter what happens or what the characters do. They aren't going to act logically and choices won't bare any consequences. The story is going to plod along whether it contradicts anything that came before so it can reach its targeted goal. The good guys won't die, the bad guys will, lots of flash action scenes will fill every possible moment - it's all a product catered to a group of fans who want more of what they love. The problem is, by adding more to a series that was truly innovative and great, it reduces what the original was. Star Wars was once a movie series that changed the lives of many people and changed the way SciFi was done. Now Star Wars is a franchise on the level of never ending horror flicks like Elmstreet or Halloween. Each additional story doesn't add anything to the original experience (the prequel trilogy did that at the very least). The stories are instead rehashing everything that's come before to deliver an ""experience."" They are completely unnecessary experiences, however (ie. If you didn't watch them, nothing will change in the other films). I'm pretty sure that Lucas didn't intend Palpatine to come back (which does kind of negate the point of the original trilogy, if all they fought for didn't really defeat him). And it's obvious that the motivation for telling these stories isn't ""Hey, I've got a great story for you,"" (which is the basis of any good movie, book, comic, etc) but instead, ""let's keep this going (so I can make money off the huge audience out there)."" I suppose it's nice for the kids, who are the true audience, to have never ending fodder for their imaginations to feed on (because that's what the original trilogy was for us old folks). Still, I wish this new trilogy didn't exist so Star Wars could be what it is was - a (finite) story that inspires your imagination.",0

136,3.0,"Ok, so Leia is a Jedi Master, apparently. Yep, let that sink in for a second. All the things you've grown to hate about the modern interpretation of Star Wars are there, with none of the charm, subtlety or sincerity of the originals. The whole movie is basically a plotless, intergalactic scavenger hunt. We need to go here and find that, so we can go there and get this and then go there and do that. The whole second act could be removed and the outcome would be the same. And the shmaltz, don't they layer it on thick, and at every opportunity. And there are the usual nonsensical happenings that plague this series. It all makes no sense and feels like what it is, an overblown copy of something that was once magic and so very loved, but is now a soulless husk.",1

In the hallway, I turned around to see JJ Abrams skittering up a wall and clawing his way towards me on the ceiling. His neck stretched 10 feet until his head was right next to mine. ""Did you liiiiike it?"" he rasped. ""Not really,"" I said. His mouth opened up five sizes too big, a great gaping black hole that began inhaling bits of popcorn and detritus off the floor, at one point almost consuming a passing toddler. ""Just make it out of here,"" I kept telling myself. ""Just make it outside and get to your car.""",1
144,2.0,This reboot franchise was rocky from the start and only got worse. Honestly this movie just feels like a cobbled together means to an end. Character arcs go absolutely nowhere and the logic behind so many of the major events is<br /><br />just baffling. Many established rules of the franchise are broken/changed and it is just plain stupid at some moments.,0

146,4.0,"One star is for updated special effects, another star is for bringing back as much of the old cast as possible, the last two I guess is just nostalgia. I truly cannot express just how angry these movies made me. The force awakens is passable somewhat but the others made me want to scream. They especially did a ridiculous disservice to Luke skywalker, making him a recluse with ptsd and ruining his reputation. And how many characters is one going to force heal? How many times is someone going to ""die"" and just come back to life without force healing? There are so many characters that are just extremely overplayed and overstayed their welcome. I simply cannot, if anyone is a true fan of Star Wars just avoid these altogether.",0

I have a lot of criticism for this pile of trash, but the biggest criticism I have is the writing. This movie has parts where it feels like it was written by Tommy Wiseau and I'm not kidding! There were parts that made me laugh because it was so bad, but even so, it wasn't like the room, which turns out to be funny within its context. This was too bad, but I can already say that this film has a very good thing, is that it seems that it lasts 4 hours and yet it is 2 hours and a little bit of film, so it even seems like a kind of torture time machine .",0

Filled with Clichés and the final battle is a copy paste from Return of the Jedi.",0

The same simpletons who loved what JJ Abrams did with his lobotomized ""reboot"" of the Star Trek universe are similarly enthralled with the Abrams-led final Star Wars trilogy.

I've always found the Star Wars films to be very interesting, and they have always held my attention...until this.<br /><br />About 1 hour in I had to go smoke a cig & grab some jalapeno peppers from concession in a futile attempt to keep myself awake.<br /><br />Somewhere around 1 hour & 45 minutes in I failed in my attempt and zonked out; only for my brother to wake me a few minutes before the end battle.<br /><br />I've never once fallen asleep during a Star Wars film. As a kid, I saw the prequels multiple times in theaters; and have watched the original epic trilogy a ridiculous amount of times.<br /><br />I LOVE these films. That truly should tell you how garbage this was.<br /><br />I didn't care about any of the characters, there was nothing even remotely interesting about the storyline. It was convoluted garbage; with so many stupid conversations that had nothing to do with anything. The movie could have been over in a hour or less.<br /><br />The ""surprises"" were no surprise at all.",0
155,7.0,J.J. Abrams tries his best at concluding one of the biggest franchises. It's well made and makes some safe choices in trying to service the original trilogy fan base. Personally was not a fan of 'The Last Jedi' so I thought the writers redeemed this trilogy from distancing themselves from Rian Johnson's work.,0
156,4.0,"I'm gonna start with the good. I love almost everything with Kylo/Ben (I even don't mind the kiss scene, whatever). To me, he is probably the one character in this sequel trilogy that has a consistent arc all throughout. I love that he redeemed himself, his fight scene with the knights (even though they are USELESS in this trilogy) is great, his fight with Rey at the Death Star is probably my favorite moment of the entire movie. I like his scene with Han, and even with all we know about the situation with Carrie Fisher, I think they handled they relationship fine, the fact that her death is what makes him turn to the light side again is beautiful. Again, the only character that has an arc throughout, he is by far my favorite thing about this trilogy.",1
157,1.0,"I'm going to just gloss over the main points of this dumpster fire because if I don't this review could be a book. No explanation of how the Emperor survived the explosion of the Death Star over Endor. No explanation of WHY if he can make clones he's still using his crippled, old body when he could CLONE a new one. Palpatine is now Overdog from Space Hunter Adventures in the Forbidden Zone with a mechanical arm shoved up his posterior because you know, in Star Wars there aren't prosthetic bodies like Vader had....oh the stupid...but I digress. He's also a Space Vampire like Overdog that can drain life force to restore himself yet he didn't do that in ANY OTHER STAR WARS movie he was in. I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw him flinch away from Rey making a cross with two light sabers (like he's friggin Dracula). He uses force lightening to ""attack"" the Resistance fleet...nice new power we've never seen before. What is he Thanos now? No explanation of ANY of the RIDICULOUS force powers in this movie in general. Nobody trains, nobody has to work to achieve these powers, they just get them like some kind of Super Hero movie. The force is apparently a Star Trek transporter now that transports an object to Kylo Ren from Mary Sue Rey (who is God-Mod-Level Mary Sue in this) which allows Klyo to find her. Oh and Princess Leia was a Jedi, had a lightsaber, and can use the force like a master Jedi...because why not? She also so dies in the most lame way. Snoke was Palpatine's creation and he has new replacement Snokes in Jars (yeah...stupid). Also, Star Destroyers now have a planet-killing beam cannon even though they're only Imperial I style and not the size of an Eclipse or Sovereign class SSD. This fleet is hidden under ice, who knows where the crew came from, or how they were fed, none of it is explained and so it just comes off as cheap and contrived. There's a lot more, but the main reason this is a 1-star for me is because it totally makes everything that Luke did to save Anakin a moot point and a wasted endeavor. Why bother with these sequels if all these did was trash what the original trilogy established? The prequels were not great, but they didn't destroy any of what came before. They were original stories that told us how Anakin became Vader and in that they succeeded. In this Disney Trilogy everything that was created in the first 6-films is now pointless. None of it matters because Palpatine won. He succeeded in killing Kylo Ren (the last actual Skywalker) and wiping out Luke's legacy. Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, so her taking Luke's last name (she just declares herself a Skywalker), taking his moisture farm, taking his X-wing, and essentially taking away and destroying his legacy makes me think this movie should have been titled ""Demise of Skywalker"".",0
158,1.0,"The Disney trilogy for star wars is just sooo horribly wrong and trash in every way, I've watched them multiple times trying to convince myself to enjoy them due to enjoying the history of them so much...

161,2.0,"I regret finally watching this. It may be the most soulless and tonally jarring movie I've ever watched. 55% of the dialogue is (not-so) witty quips, while the remainder is exposition with catchphrases spouted at random to fill in the gaps. There is an uncanny valley effect seeing characters engaged in ""conversation"" where everyone seems to respond with pre-programmed comebacks or unrelated narration. The formula here seems to be: fast-paced chases + fast-paced dialogue + callbacks = blockbuster hit! No need for subtle characterization that makes characters feel human (or alien), or building atmosphere with a sense of thematic purpose and letting the audience breathe it in. I know the problem isn't with the franchise itself, because I recently watched creators achieve these things with the Star Wars Visions short films like ""The Village Bride"" and ""The Ninth Jedi"", which were a wonder to behold.",1

165,2.0,"Dreadful. A boring, poorly acted, disrespectful, pointless pile of crud. Gets 2 stars because I liked the horse/pig things. Actually disappointed that the original cast had anything to do with this at all. They sold their credibility out completely. Appreciate money is a motivator, but they can't be that skint surely? Praying they were ""forced"" at gun point to do this. Would explain the wooden acting. And as for Ridley, Boyega and Isaac... Remember the excitement we felt as star wars fans that we were finally going to see the old cast get together again? Do you think the same excitement will be felt in 30 years over those 3? It will be more of a case of who? Oh yeah them.. Where did they drag them out from? I have never seen a more wooden actress than Ridley. Across all 3 films Rey was possibly the lamest, most pointless, irrelevant, boring, monotone, unbelievable character ever formulated in the history of cinema. Remember when Yoda kicked off with Doku in attack of the clones, or that wonderful scene in Rogue 1 when Vader storms the rebellion ship? Ever feel that excitement with any of her fight scenes? Nah me either. Why? Because her character was as dull as dishwater. I quote her feelings on the force.. ""It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and-make things float."" ... Deep, really deep. Make sure you say that in your head as flat as you possibly can to get the full ""Rey"" effect. I mean I appreciate she was a victim of a poor script, story and production but Jesus her delivery was as flat as a pancake. And Finn, oh Finn!! The chemistry between him and Rey was just.. Non existent. The comical dialogue! It was like watching two 4 years olds trying to recite Shakespeare, though I'm sure most could do a better job.",0

Their last hope is some single orphan - the unsuspecting son/daughter of the evil master. The only chance to defeat the giant evil army is to destroy an undefended small element (a hut in the jungle/small antenna/locator, etc.). The main orphan ends up in front of the evil guy, where together they watch as the remnants of the rebel fleet are destroyed.

Its dummed up when Poe light speed jumps repeatedly in the Millennium Falcon to different locations because it looks cool. It skips any plot that makes sense creates more holes and ruins Gangster Palpatine he has pickled cloned Snokes in jars why? No idea let's pass it. It passes any showing of how these characters changed and what their purpose was in the first place, it someone retcons last jedi which is hilarious but shows how they are making up things as they go along, it has both to much exposition and then doesn't explain or show enough, Palpatines plan is stupid, even Rey's a murderer in this an overpowered Mary Sue God that left me dead inside. I'm sure the people who love this film haven't even seen or like the Original Trilogy because they did the same arc with Vader being saved by Luke but in this the morale and logic is idiotic and they ruin it in this film, if Luke murdered Vader then brought him back to life then he jumped away Return of the Jedi would have been worse. Your telling me this is what it's all been leading to 3 trilogies, Hux is a mole? What a joke that's like saying Tarkin was a mole in A New Hope absolutely ridiculous. People say it has memorable quotes, I don't remember hearing any apparently it's special effects are great it left me apathetic and it should be called A New Hopeless. The story is an embarrassment a sideshow joke and whenever some idiot says Star Wars is for children I say does Pepper Pig have decapitations? Does Postman Pat have planets destroyed by weapons of mass destruction killing 100s of millions of lifeforms? are people set on fire or burned into smoking skeletons in Frozen are children killed in Dumbo? So use your brain people don't be a zombie. This makes Spiderman 3 and Batman Vs Superman look restrained, smart, streamlined less bloated and make more sense.

The only bit of nostalgic feel good factor comes at the end of the movie, but we've had to sit through so many McGuffin's and plot contrivances by then that nobody cares. I love Carrie Fisher and mourn her passing but the re-utilised footage is distracting and doesn't really work. Also the whole ""they're dead..no they're not dead"" thing is overused and leads to a low stakes story. How much more moving & dramatic it would have been to say goodbye to Chewie and C3PO but this film is too safe to go there. The whole Palpatine thing is boring & riddled with plot holes.

If you took out all the necessary exposition used to explain what was happening and why it needed to happen, i'm sure the movie would have flowed better, made more of an emotional impact, and feel more satisfying for audiences. What it was, was sort of clunky, at times outright awkward, and the occasionally visually entertaining. I'm not entirely giving Abrams a pass because there were definitely scenes of audience pandering, and I'm not sold on if the entire direction of the trilogy was the way to go. Out of the four new Star Wars movies Rogue One still stands as far superior and closest to the original trilogy.

199,5.0,"Trying to put aside all the emotions and feelings that are soaring through me after last nights premiere of the Rise of Skywalker (RoS) I will only refer to my last two reviews of the sequel trilogy (The Force Awakens 9/10; The Last Jedi 10/10) which show a clear fondness for the sequel trilogy. This final instalment was supposed to wrap up the new trilogy and be a definite conclusion of the entire saga (not an easy task), and it failed in every single aspect. Not only is this a bad Star Wars movie, it is simply a bad movie.",0
200,2.0,This was a boring film. The Mary Sue is still there being a Mary Sue and defying the rules of the force. They also shoehorn a forced relationship.,0
201,6.0,"Now, I actually don't have a lot of issues with this film. Only 3 issues really stand out to me, but they are 3 very major issues. The first is the pacing. Were the prequels or The Last Jedi too slow for you? Well, this movie moves along so fast it barely gives you any time to breathe! For some who just want to go on a fun ride, this might be a good thing. For me though, slowing down and letting the characters just talk to each other is really important. This movie barely does that. There is always something going on or a plot twist being dropped. It went so fast, I didn't even have time to comprehend a lot of it! This movie feels very rushed. It does slow down a little later on, but it's still a major issue with a good chunk of the film. There are also WAY too many new characters introduced! You have a large enough cast as it is, just work with what you already have! My second issue is Palpatine. It's no spoiler that Emperor Palpatine returns in this movie. His voice can be heard in every trailer and he's on the teaser poster. You're supposed to know this going in. Palpatine's return is handled horribly. He's supposed to be the main villain even though he's been completely absent from the last two movies. It's completely anti-climactic. None of the characters know who he is or have any real connection with him. We're supposed to accept that he's somehow still alive even though we saw him die! He fell down a pit and EXPLODED!!! It's not like bringing back Maul or Boba Fett. They literally tell you he came back to life in the opening crawl and then go on to hand-wave it away with a prequel meme. That's it. I'm not kidding. It's embarrassing how poorly-written he is. They never explain where he's been all this time, what he's been up to, why he's been doing it, how he's been doing it, why he's waited so long, or how he was resurrected. Did someone fish his body out of the Death Star? Is he some kind of clone, like in the old Dark Empire comics? Is he a ghost? I have no idea, and I bet the filmmakers don't either. It's insulting. The third issue I have with this film is the lack of continuity with the other movies, The Last Jedi especially. A lot of that movie is either ignored or undone by this movie. Rose is replaced with a giant slug monster and relegated to a background role, they bring in an Emperor figure when the last movie made a point to get rid of that and have Kylo Ren be the main villain, and let's just say that Rey isn't exactly a nobody. Could you imagine if Richard Marquand got rid of Lando and made Luke not actually Vader's son in Return of the Jedi? It's so frustrating. JJ Abrams sacrificed a flowing narrative for this trilogy for his own original vision. It's selfish and it's childish. Again, this may be a positive if you hated The Last Jedi. I really like The Last Jedi, so this really bothered me. It's clear that there was no plan for this trilogy from the beginning and the filmmakers didn't have enough communication with one another. It's not only TLJ that this movie retcons. Bringing Palpatine back really diminishes Anakin's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jedi and kind of rewrites the entire Star Wars mythos. He was the chosen one, prophesied to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. He did that by killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Only he didn't, Palpatine survived. I had the same issue with the old Expanded Universe. I thought the reason they got rid of the EU was so that they could improve on the post-Jedi storyline, not repeat the same mistakes it made, only somehow worse. Who's the chosen one now? What's the point of the prophecy? What did Anakin die for? I have no idea! This movie also contradicts some of the newer books and comics. Again, I thought the point of getting rid of the EU was to create a more cohesive universe with the films and the non-film material. If the movies are still going to ignore or contradict the books and comics, why did they find it necessary to discontinue the old books and comics from coming out at all? They could have two timelines going on at the same time, I don't think it would be confusing! Anyway, I'm getting very nerdy and off-topic. From how much I'm trashing this movie, you might think that I hate it. I don't. I still had fun watching it and there was quite a bit that I enjoyed. Rey and Kylo Ren are still great, the effects are excellent as always (The integration of the Carrie Fisher footage is pretty seamless.), the action is thrilling, there's good comedy, the acting is good and there are many surprises that got me genuinely excited. I also liked how it didn't retcon the Luke storyline from TLJ, they just made it more clear for those in the audience who didn't fully understand the point of it in the last movie. This movie also explains why Hyperspace ramming isn't a common tactic in warfare in the Star Wars universe, after it was shown to be so deadly in The Last Jedi. Overall, this movie is an absolute mess and a major disappointment, but it makes for a fun time out at the movies. Just don't think too hard about how it connects with the other Star Wars movies and you'll be fine. I can see why people like it, it's just not for me.",0

203,1.0,"One of the first movies I remember seeing in the theater as a child was Return of the Jedi. I can still remember the loud applause of the crowd at the powerful scene where Darth Vader saves his son and throws the Emperor to his death. My dad stood up and cheered as did many others in the audience. As I got older and watched that entire trilogy (and later on, as a young adult, watching the prequels) I realized the overall theme of that franchise and the importance of that moment: A person's fall from grace because of the seduction of evil and their redemption through the light. It made the moment of Vader's/ Anakin's redemption at the end of ROTJ that much more powerful; the emperor was destroyed and Anakin fufilled his destiny as the chosen one.",1
204,1.0,"So glad I didn't pay to see this. This was the dictionary definition of mediocre effort.

Its the closest that person can get to a life. Merely existing in name only does not satisfy. Star Wars and the force did what it was supposed to do at its birth. Today, we are witnessing its death. Bloated, over or under-paid indifferent various persons either relatives, snake-charmers or wolfs in sheep's clothing are in charge of the story-telling which in this movie they can't wait for the story to end before it has even begun. Whatever happened to talent? Devotion? Skills? How about dreams & visions? All replaced by Disney! I am amazed how you can mess up a good thing not once or twice but three times? I am a Star Wars fan, a lover of Disney and a supporter of good storytelling. What a let-down and I knew this from the first Disney film, confirmed in the second one and from what I read and heard won't even waste my time in going to see this. How sad. I want to spend my money and this film and the series under Disney is telling me DON'T! Here is the scary part. If they make back their money it may send a signal to keep repeating what fans don't like but what makes money instead. But it won't last and it may even undo all the good as well. Remember: You go to the movies and then you realize it wasn't worth it. That's why they will make their money back but not for the love of the series. Bring in a whole new team, leave them alone and let them tell stories about a Galaxy and time far away...if you can. We need love not $$$",0
207,5.0,"Honestly, I really have no idea what the title actually has to do with this particular movie, especially since we know that Luke passed on at the end of the previous film.

But in this case you really should believe them. This is a lazy film from an overhyped director with some pretty appalling acting thrown into the mix to top it off. I wouldn't call myself a Star Wars fan, although I've seen all of the films, so I approach this on the merits of the quality of the film, the script and the acting. There appeared to be no ingenuity whatsoever - just same old same old, crank the handle and out pops another one. The whole experience was lacklustre to say the least, over long and frankly quite dull and predictable. As for the acting, I heard that Abrams called Daisy Ridley's acting ""wooden"" when they first worked together. If that was his opinion then you can only wonder why on earth she was picked for such a prominent role to begin with? She seems to have a range of two faces - scowling angrily or looking wistfully off camera. Talk about two dimensional. Her performance alone, or distinct lack thereof, is enough on its own to avoid this film. The rest of the cast did the best they could with a weak, cheese-riddled script and predictable dialogue. No stand-outs though. Given the production value and overall cost of a film like this, along with the history it carries before it and the fact this is the last in the series, it's not surprising that so many are disappointed.

Rian Johnson did make some decisions that made a sequel very tough, but this movie spends a lot of its time trying to undo the previous movie.

We get it JJ, you hated episode 8. We all did. But in a way, it made more sense than this movie. Or at least it was more entertaining. Forget all the fakeout deaths (there are three!) forget the stupid, cringey lines, forget having an interesting plot (this is one long fetch quest that dissolves into Michael Bay incoherence) - I just want you to make a movie.

The only new concepts in the movie made little sense and ended abruptly after being just presented. This doesn't feel like the Rise of anything, it feels like a terrible end where nothing has any value. People hate The Last Jedi. Well, that was kind of interesting, introducing new things to a tired little fairytale. Not good by any measure, but at least not boring. Rise of Skywalker is a Final Order of magnitude worse. No world building, no consistency of character, rushed, badly edited, the inbreeding of everyone with everyone, a consistent obliteration of any purpose, feeling or technical concept. It was a thorough Sithesque dismantling of Star Wars. But worse of all, because I really am not a fan and so I couldn't care less about this franchise, this film was boring as hell.",0

From the opening title crawl all the way to the end, many of the decisions made throughout the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga were very cringe and confusing. My biggest complaint was the fact that Palpatine is just randomly back with no explanation and we're just forced to accept that. His plan was also extremely convoluted with bringing in Kylo, just to bring in Rey so that she could kill him and possess her body. Even though he tempted Rey to kill him, which is exactly what she ends up doing, but now Palpatine is DEAD dead like ???? Shouldn't Rey be possessed now??Some other problems I had was that the movie was just way too quick with trying to fix the Last Jedi as well as stick with the plot. The runtime should've been much longer in order to make the story better and make a little more sense. And Rey Skywalker?! What a disrespectful move by Rey. If she can just take that family name by saying so then I guess anyone in the universe is a Skywalker. Talk about the plot holes too! We still don't know who the Knights of Ren are, force healing was a thing all along, and everything about Palpatine. I did like a few things such as Luke and Han showing up and doing what they did, the voices of the past Jedi, and seeing Palpatine revert back to his less zombie looking self.

The Force Awakens was weak, The Last Jedi was awful, but The Rise of Skywalker truly sticks a dirty big middle finger in the faces of the fans. Disney must have hated Star Wars so much they had to buy it so they could destroy it. I'm really not kidding when I say this either because having the Star Wars tag in front of the title meant Disney knew whatever pig swill they churned out was always going to make them a big fat profit.

262,3.0,"So the crawl just states the Emporer was still alive all along, yet we saw him explode and the death star exploded. Who rescued him, Snoke was some kind of genetic experiment. This story was made up as they went along and it was thrown together. I won't say anymore but the storyline was just garbage and lacked any sort of creativity and continuity. Disney really need to forget Star Wars, just focus on what they are good at Snow White, The Jungle Book, Dumbo and Mickey Mouse. Disney have all but killed Star Wars, my kids still prefer the original trilogy and awknowledge the prequels. The 3rd trilogy makes no sense from the off, maybe its because of the nonsense political route Hollywood has gone in. Darth Vader/Anakin didn't force ghost yet Kylo Renn/Ben Sky walker did. The knights of Ren had no lightsabres? Chewbacca dies then its OK because he's on another spaceship? There is so much that is so wrong with the film, the pace is so bad its like what is going on? The effects are fantastic to a point and that's why I gave it a 3 and not a 1 or a 2. One last time please Disney don't make anymore, sell the rights to somebody who can direct and write a script. JJ Abrahams and Rhain Johnson are the most overated directors alive. They along with that Kennedy have destroyed every little boy's hopes and dreams they had for Star Wars. Star Wars Murderers!

I feel like somehow we should never allow these movies to air. No one should have to see this awful nonsense. It completed RUINED the Star Wars legacy of the characters we love. Screw the guy who created this BULL s* nonsense. This guy should NEVER be allowed to write another movie. I can't express how much I DESPISE these last three movies they made. Whoever signed off on this needs to retire and do something else. They have completed RUINED Anni's story... last three movies are just AWEFUL!!,0

I loved their relationship.<br /><br />The second one of this series was so much better. I would skip this completely.,0
267,3.0,"In retrospect, all the signs for impending disaster were there. Way back in 2012, George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney, along with his original story treatments for Episodes VII, VIII and IX. In April, 2014, Disney erased much of the original Star Wars canon (now to be consumed under the 'Legends' banner) to make way for their new timeline of canonical storylines to accommodate their brand new cinematic releases. This, of course, was the first strike for many, with large parts of the fandom rightfully miffed about this erasure. The Force Awakens (2015), the first instalment of the sequel trilogy, broke records upon release, scoring a mighty box office return of $2.068b. I enjoyed The Force Awakens very much, and at the time overlooked how it was basically an updated version of A New Hope (1977). Despite this, J.J Abrams set up plenty of interesting plot threads that could have moved the trilogy into new and exciting territory. Two years later, Rian Johnson takes the reigns with The Last Jedi, ultimately regarded as the most polarising Star Wars film to date. While The Last Jedi does have several good things going for it, it was a largely disappointing instalment only made worse by Mark Hamill's negative remarks concerning Johnson's treatment of his character, Luke Skywalker. Perhaps what didn't help either was Johnson's complete rewriting of what Abrams had planned, opting to instead ""subvert fan expectations"" and, in the process, muck up the whole flow of the trilogy with his questionable creative decisions. And now, The Rise of Skywalker is upon us. Strap yourselves in folks, you're in for a wild one.",0

271,1.0,"Oh boy , where to start . For those who don't want to read the rest , take it from me , this movie is the worst in the series and makes from The Phantom Menace a gem. My feelings during the movier : none , I felt like Spock . Not afraid , nothing thrilling , nothing to laugh about , nothing to bother about. I think that there was so much footage , then they hired someone with scissors and next someone with tape to stick some parts together without any available light. The screenwriters : shoot them out of the galaxy together with the rest including Mickey Mouse Disney. Not only is this is the worst in the series , for me it is also one of the worst movies ever seen in 50 years. I thought , finally , no Death Star , yippie , but no , there was one , only this time it was a Death 'Death Star' . And oh , there were suddenly 2 Ewoks ( shoot Disney again ) , Luke and Leia and a previous death Emperor . Jar Jar Binks ? not seen , unless it was during a time that I closed my eyes for being so ashamed that I was watching this vehicle of crap. I feel sorry for the director , who I think was pushed hard to kiss Disney their feet and cash their money to make this . I feel sorry for the musicians to watch this crap and create layers and layers of endless scores. The only positive and for which I give 1 star is the acting from Adam Driver. Daisy Ridley , sorry , overacting and not convincing.<br /><br />For sure the last SW movie I will ever want to see , even Mel Brooks his pastiche was way better , even 2 minutes of Southpark are better .

272,4.0,"I really wish Rian Johnson would've done the newest Star Wars movie. He is way more creative and I'm sure he could've followed up the last Jedi in a satisfying way. The problem with Abrams is that he's not good at telling stories so when you present him a challenge, like many ideas he set up being discarded in the second movie, he didn't know what to do. So he attempted to cater to nagging fans and back pedal on the choices made in the second movie which left a movie with no clear goal in mind and it's clear Palpatine was a desperate last minute decision which is a shame because given the right story, his return could've been cool.",0

It really tries to connect with the original Skywalker saga but IMO it falls horribly short.

286,4.0,"The Star Wars franchise under Disney has certainly been in a pretty rocky place as of late, and there hasn't been a more emblematic example of that than the Sequel Trilogy. The Force Awakens was a good, albeit not perfect, starting point for the trilogy, then there was The Last Jedi which was a flawed yet ambitious and overall fine film that greatly divided the fanbase. So, naturally, a lot was put on the shoulders of J. J. Abrams and company to bring the trilogy back home with at least a solid conclusion in The Rise of Skywalker, which was not only meant to end the Sequel Trilogy but also bring the Skywalker Saga to a close. And, as far as my consensus is concerned, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker did end the saga, but not in a satisfying way. In fact, I have to say that it's my least favorite film in the episodic Skywalker Saga overall. So, let's set S foils in attack position and talk about the letdown that was The Rise of Skywalker.",1
287,1.0,"Rise of Skywalker is either ignorant to its backstory or irrational to the context. Talk about the worst, EP IX doesnt even fit in the saga. It was a cheap move by Disney to bring an abrupt ending to the Skywalker saga and that too with the means of a groundless plot.",0

The viewer is expected to get on board with massive, unexplained story developments with no time to wrap their head around them as director JJ Abrams stuffs in as many ""fanboy"" pleasing checkpoints as possible, seemingly almost out of spite. The effects are as impressive as ever but often spoiled by bad lighting choices and even when they aren't it is the same iconography you've seen time and time before.<br /><br />The acting is mostly solid, with Ridley and Driver exceling but the film is a mess and a worrying turn for the franchise.

Doing that, it ignores and contradicts previous stuff. For example: Rey's family obviously had significance in the first movie, but turned out to be nothing in the second movie, only to actually be of significance in the third movie. This is a result of a story that is written in patches without any planning at all.<br /><br />The second problem is poor dialog and characters. Finn might be the worst character in movie history. He should be named ""Mr. Exposition"". He's only there to do exposition and repeat stuff that other characters say or explain what happens on the screen. This is the problem with most of the characters in the movie but Finn is by far the worst. Basically, the dialog is intended for 3-year olds and feeds you everything twice. ""They fly now! They flying now? They fly now..."" (a dialog by three characters on a flying speeder, amazed by flying Stormtroopers).<br /><br />Beside having scenes that have nothing to do with each other, the movie is also full of clichés, most notably characters thought to be dead who aren't and characters coming back from the dead - most notably Palpatine, who is basically Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II in this movie.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fan service movie.

Abrams took everything I loved about Star Wars ripped it into tiny shreds and threw it in the trash. At first I thought Last Jedi was bad, but after seeing this catastrophe, it made me realize that even though Last Jedi was not what I was expecting, at least that movie had originality than this. Rise of Skywalker feels like Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back on speed. There is so much information being crammed into this final movie that they don't take a moment to breathe and give it a proper ending. This is one of the reasons why I loved the original trilogy because they treated those movies like a family from the cast to the extras, to everyone involved with the original saga. I can't say the same thing with this film however. I'll give the Force Awakens the benefit of the doubt because at least J.J. Abrams gave us his own vision of Star Wars ten years after Revenge of the Sith was released. However this film feels like a dysfunctional family, as all the characters from Force Awakens I don't even recognize them anymore. But the biggest problem is that no-one sat down, watched the Last Jedi, and followed up on those events, but instead they pretended that that didn't exist because fans were frustrated by how that turned out. And this is the problem with Star Wars is that it doesn't take risks anymore as it did with the prequels and the originals, which I sympathize. Everybody criticizes the prequels, but I have a soft spot for them, because at least George Lucas created a world before the originals and just ran with it no matter how half baked it looked. To wrap up this review, as much as I am destroying this, there were some parts that I liked, but in the end it didn't get the proper ending it deserved and that left me disappointed.",0
333,1.0,The worst script for a movie I have ever seen. Everything in this sorry excuse for a movie happens because of luck. Rey reading the random page on wayfinders the day that information is needed. Accidentally falling through quicksand. Chewie randomly being on a different ship so he's alive after Rey randomly uses force lightning. Poe happening to know a droidsmith and someone with a token that helps them escape the droidsmith planet. Rey pointing the random dagger they luckily found at the exact point in the Death Star ruins where the wayfinder is. There's more but this review would be 100 pages long if I listed everything.,0

As a casual fan that has watched these movies since I was a kid, I very much enjoyed it. Maybe I'm just a sap for the hero's journey and the beats that go with good against evil...

Once again you have ships that can blow away planets ( aka another death star).... leia's death made no sense, as did the ending which showed the emperor ( who should not be alive in the first place), get his power back only to loose it to rey with a double saber.... come on now?? Why???? Im not surprised though, its just funny listening to these fan boys who think this the best thing since sliced bread..",1

341,3.0,"Coming into Thursday's premiere, I remember thinking that ""The Rise of Skywalker"" was the most doomed thing ever created. I couldn't imagine any scenario where this film could succeed. If it was terrible, it would be called the final nail in the coffin for a flawed trilogy. If it was mediocre, anything it lacked would be blamed on both previous films, calling the whole trilogy into question. And if, somehow, it was good, it would come off as desperate, trying to cover up the sins of the past. When looking at most of the first reviews, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" managed to conjure all of these feelings while accomplishing nothing.",0

I'm going back to see it again tomorrow, to once again take in that stunningly beautiful final Star Wars shot, in all it's emotional glory.<br /><br />Star Wars has been a massive part of my life and tonight the saga ended with me feeling full of wonder, awe and absolute total satisfaction; thanks JJ.<br /><br />Once again the majority of movie critics have demonstrated their irrelevance!",1

And that lesbian kiss is just statement that is saying 'hey poe and finn turned out to be straight, we need another same sex couple to show up'. Thanks Kathleen Kennedy. This movie does not live up to the hype, even though the hype felt really low compard to the force/a new hope awakens. To few force ghosts also, where were yoda, ben solo or anakin/obi-wan.

356,3.0,"This film is nothing but a cheap imitation of what make the other films great. JJ Abrams seeks to save the film from what the fans hated about The Last Jedi to cater to fans. The critical hate of this film is well deserved as it has nothing new to say in the Star Wars universe. If you want lightsaber battles and starship battles, it might be the film for you. This film caters to fans is highly predictable and blatantly rips off famous scenes and set pieces from previous Star Wars films and it is all I could think about while watching the movie. However, the acting done by Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are quite good in this film and do deserve some praise for their efforts. The cinematography is good as usual with the creation of new worlds to explore and new backdrops for scenes. The scenery is great and could give the movie an Oscar in best special effects but is that really a surprise? It is not a fitting conclusion to the new trilogy and leaves much to be desired.",0

It's a checklist of of fan service items strewn together with no attempt at coherent storytelling. It also exists to retcon the (vastly underrated) Last Jedi. Everything good that LJ setup, ROS discounts and/or changes. It's petty and sad. Of course, the saddest thing is that this mess of a film was made for the die hard fans and they hate it. LJ looks a lot better now, doesn't it? Lol. I gave it three stars simply because it's a very pretty film.",0
364,9.0,"Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) lives, and has sent a message to the galaxy threatening revenge with a huge fleet of planet-killing ships. The Resistance, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), must find the clues that will lead to his location and allow them to defeat him once again, despite the fury of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).<br /><br />For the third time in many adults' lifetimes, a conclusion of the Skywalker saga. Once again, a trilogy has built to this finale; once again, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. This one features no Sarlaac pit, nor is it as much of a step up from its predecessor as Revenge Of The Sith. But it does feel like a conclusion to the story that director JJ Abrams began in The Force Awakens, for better and sometimes for worse.<br /><br />Although The Last Jedi split fan opinion, it unquestionably caused the biggest shake up in Star Wars lore since that revelation in The Empire Strikes Back. That opened up the story's universe to exciting new possibilities: to characters beyond the small Skywalker group and to injustices and shortcomings in the Resistance as well as the Empire. Yet Abrams almost entirely ignores the doors it opened and goes back to his first instinct, sticking close to elements established in The Force Awakens. So abandoned ideas like the Knights of Ren are back, and the conversation about Rey's parentage that Johnson seemed to lay to rest is reborn like the Emperor. Perhaps it should feel like a relief after Last Jedi's shocks, but instead the effect is to make this story feel like a step backwards at times rather than a great leap forward, and to make the whole trilogy feel disjointed instead of just one film in it.<br /><br />Still, some elements are wonderful. Daisy Ridley's Rey is training now under Leia (Carrie Fisher) and has become more confident in her power, if not in her capacity to resist the Dark Side. She is still linked, bound even, to Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, and their clashes gives the film most of its best emotional scenes. Their strange connection has outlasted Snoke and grown stronger; they can duel no matter where they are in the galaxy, and taunt each other with visions of the future that support their own beliefs. And Ridley's terrific, tormented by the idea that it is her destiny to go to the Dark Side and afraid of her own power.<br /><br />She and Kylo are therefore strangely well matched. Rey is passionately invested in her friendships and her cause; he is passionately cynical and suspicious of everyone. Rey is convinced by Finn that she doesn't have to do everything alone here; Kylo still has terrible impulse control and flits off after her instead of Supreme Lead-ing the First Order whenever possible. But don't worry, he leaves Domnhall Gleeson's Hux and Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde in charge, both sneering competitively and delightfully at, well, the entire universe but neither seeming entirely reliable.<br /><br />The story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging.<br /><br />Meanwhile Finn (John Boyega) now travels with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewie (Jonas Suotamo) harvesting information from spies for Leia. Poe - in full Indiana Jones mode - is loads of fun here, though these capers bear little relation to his learning curve last time. Boyega is strangely underserved: he gets more screentime than before but less forward motion. While Finn's bond with Rey is repeatedly said to be important to both, they get no room to actually develop it. He's too busy being introduced to new rebel Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a charismatic actress without much to do. It might have been more economical storytelling to just let Finn shack up with Poe - or to give Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) more than a few lines. Keri Russell's Zorii Bliss is another interesting figure who's ultimately mostly there to flirt with Poe. Does he really need another love interest when he can generate heat with literally anyone? Alongside other newcomers like Babu Frik (Shirley Henderson) and droid D-0, and the glorious return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and others, there's a whole lot of distraction on our heroes' journey. Sometimes it's fan service, but too often it feels more like pandering.<br /><br />That journey, too, is more complicated than normal. To defeat the Emperor, our heroes face a quest straight from high fantasy or average gaming: find the thing that points to the other thing to do the next thing, with a couple of bonus rescues along the way. The trail leads to the storm-battered remnants of the second Death Star, the ""Forbidden Desert of Pasaana"" and the snow-flecked world of Kijimi. The level of craft and design in these films remains extraordinary; visually they're all gorgeous, particularly the towering waves of that world in the Endor system.<br /><br />As they search, destiny keeps calling. Rey and Kylo must face one another again; the Emperor must be defeated without the victor simply taking his place on the Sith Throne. And Emperor Palpatine is back, terribly changed but still potent, more machine now than man. Whether that is a good thing for Star Wars storytelling is less clear.<br /><br />That's because, for all the visual panache, pleasing cameos and interesting newcomers here, for all that Ridley and Driver pour into their stand-offs, the Emperor's presence shows a disturbing lack of faith at the heart of Rise Of Skywalker. The fan backlash last time has been taken on-board too well; the storytelling here sputters whenever it approaches any similar chance to turn away from narrative convention and do something truly unexpected. You wish that this galaxy didn't feel so small and scared of stepping away from George Lucas' shadow.<br /><br />Maybe it won't matter to fans. There are effective emotional punches before the end, as we say a final goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her generation of stars and as Kylo and Rey face their demons. Arguably the story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging. When it focuses on Rey and Kylo, this film usually works. Whatever the Dark Side says, we can make our own destiny, and we change the universe when we do.<br /><br />It looks gorgeous and offers strong performances from Driver and Ridley in particular, but ultimately the saga ends with neither a bang nor a whimper but something inbetween.",1

The plot holes are still huge, the whole trilogy still makes no sense and it's worse than fan-fiction. Bottom line all 3 movies are trash and Disney will make a LOT of people happy if they brand the whole trilogy non Canon and cast it off as a mistake and lesson learned. On the other hand while I can understand the people who voted , it's not a 1 star movie either. Cinematography is great, effects are once more a marvel to behold and the movie is flawless production wise. Disregard the 8-9 star reviews, disregard the 0-1 star reviews too.

These three things almost make it feel like an expensive music video, only the music accompanying the scene is boring.

It is orbiting the red planet mentioned above. And that planet, in turn, is orbiting another planet. The central planet is huge, the one orbiting it is smaller, of course, but still, so big it does not entirely fit in the frame. And the spaceship known to be huge, now compared to these two planets, looks very small. But that is not all. Several small ships are on their way from the audience to the big ship. When they first appear, they look big, but they are moving away fast, and soon are small enough. The size, the comparison, the scale, all these details remind me of how mighty ""Star Wars"" was way back in the day. Nice touch. One that both ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" lacked, by the way.",0
392,7.0,"Oh boy if you had a problem with Rey being a Mary Sue in the previous two movies this movie isn't going to win you over. She can heal people at random now and she can invoke the spirit of dead Jedis. It also turns out that she's the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine. Now I will admit making Rey the granddaughter of the Emperor is thematically interesting, but it seems more like a plot device than anything else. Now let's talk about what a tool the Emperor is. You know for a guy that drones on and on about how brilliant and powerful he is, he's seriously lacking in critical thinking skills. Hey Einstein instead of blasting Rey with force lightening why don't you sic your hordes of clones to kill her? Now that I think about it, the ending to Rise of Skywalker kind of reminds me of Matrix Revolutions. Anyway I digress, there are things to like about this movie. I love the whole dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren and watching them join forces in the third act is dope. I also love the interplay between Finn and Poe they have a nice rapport. This film feels more like a sequel to Force Awakens than Last Jedi. I think JJ Abrams wanted to have his cake and eat it too. He wanted to win back the audiences that hated The Last Jedi and he wanted to please the people that loved Force Awakens. Which is why this movie feels disjointed in places . Honestly, I think Rise of Skywalker could have benefited from a few more rewrites in the script department to make the film feel more coherent. This film could have been great instead of just serviceable. If you liked Force Awakens and The Last Jedi you might as well watch the Rise of Skywalker for closure. The film is exciting in places and the actors do what they can to elevate the material.",0
393,6.0,The Rise of Skywalker was a tour de force. It subverted expectations and pushed social justice propaganda. So why didn't the critics like it? These were the same things the critics cited as reasons The Last Jedi was a masterpiece. And The Last Jedi was clearly no masterpiece.,1

The dialogue is AWFUL, and it's just as bad and sometimes worse than the prequels. There is SO MUCH exposition, it feels like a video game. The plot is so loose and bad, it basically revolves around going to get a macguffin to get another macguffin and they keep doing that until the final battle. It's that bad. None of the old or new characters are developed in this film, the story is not interesting or developed at all. It's honestly a really bad plot that's barely held together by fan service and nostalgia. There's an ""Avengers Assemble"" type moment at the end of this film that is forced, and I didn't care about ANY of it. I found Kylo's turn to be very rushed and way too easy. He couldn't be swayed once and there isn't enough development in this film or TLJ to make his turn convincing. I hated it, this further shows how unimaginative the writers are and the lack of creativity and uniqueness in this film along with the whole trilogy. Darth Vader 2.0, really?! Also the Sith Fleet is literally just the Death Star again, THE FOURTH FLIPPING TIME! JJ can you not come up with anything original?! Reylo kiss was laugh out loud levels of bad and extremely forced and cringeworthy. The Emperor stuff, his plan, and the explanation (or lack there of) of how he's here and how he's been able to do what he's been doing is honestly laughable and embarrassing. The choice to bring back the Emperor just felt like a desperate move by the filmmakers, and in the end the choice did not feel justified at all, and it kind of ruins the importance and impact of Vader's sacrifice in the OT. Rey's character was vastly disappointing in this film as well, and there's a choice made with her character that was so cheap and gimmicky and it lessens the impact of the story. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but the humor in this film is more embarrassing and cringeworthy than it was in the prequels as well as The Last Jedi. Palpatine creating Snoke was a cop out and further shows that they had no plan going into this trilogy and his inclusion was a desperate attempt to have a threatening antagonist, and they failed miserably. I almost laughed out loud when Kylo got YEEEEEETed off the cliff by Palpatine. Sigh. I have never been more disappointed in a Star Wars movie before.",0

The ""treasure hunt"" plot here is such a lazy cop-out. The whole thing seemed to be playing in fast-forward. Any surprising moment was instantly reversed in the next scene. The plot was never given a second to just BREATHE - so none of the pay-offs matter. Entire plot lines are introduced and concluded within 5 minutes. Hilarious that Finn get a THIRD forced love interest. (Rose was paid dust here - her character is completely pointless!) Rey / Kylo ""connection"" scenes were way too overplayed.

There's a clear difference between winning because you are the goodhearted ones and winning because you have hope!! you've forgotten that.

419,6.0,"'Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker (2019)' is a bit of a mess, with an uneven pace and a contrived plot. However, its peaks provide more enjoyment than any 'Star Wars' story since 1983 and its valleys only just caress the quality of the best scenes in the 'Prequel' series. The movie doesn't get good, generally, until its latter half. It features some truly cringe-worthy dialogue and a lot - and I mean a lot - of heavy-handed exposition. It just doesn't trust its audience, reminding them of every last detail and implied motive from its two predecessors. Even then, it doesn't really pick up the baton from either of those pictures. Instead, it rushes its opening moments to quickly establish a new status quo at the cost of any real franchise cohesion. Bringing Palpatine back is clearly a complete last-minute attempt to ensure discontent fans still buy a ticket, feeling forced and kind of a cop-out. I mean, if the intention has always been to have Palpatine pulling the strings, he would've been in 'The Force Awakens (2015)' in some capacity. It seems that the entire thing is being made-up on the spot, written not to complete a pre-planned trilogy but to please even the most anti-'The Last Jedi (2017)' fans. Why is it catering to fans who simply aren't there? Fan-service is all well and good until it starts to feel obligatory and distracting. That certainly happens here, with as much of the stuff stuffed in as possible. As I mentioned earlier, though, the affair does have its moments. The third act is pretty great, once you accept the contrivances that lead up to it. It, along with a handful of earlier sequences, is engaging, entertaining and emotionally resonant. It also includes some minor subversion that prevents it from feeling totally stale, even though it is certainly predictable. It's a satisfying end to an unnecessary trilogy, but it doesn't come close to being as good as the actual ending we already have. The best parts of the entire piece revolve around Kylo Ren and his long-awaited, tumultuous arc. Rey's scenes, which are usually intrinsically tied to Kylo's, are a close second, giving us a glimpse at the more nuanced and affecting film we could've had if Lucasfilm hadn't been forced into damage-control mode. Sadly, they aren't given as much time as they really need. I mean, there's no casino sequence or anything like that, but the plot just continues to pull you away from its most interesting elements. It's unfortunate, as there does seem to be a really good film hidden somewhere in here. The end result is a mixed bag. Whereas 'The Last Jedi (2017)' had decent ideas executed uninterestingly, this has uninteresting ideas executed decently. As I said before, it's more enjoyable than any of its post-'Return Of The Jedi (1983)' peers. It isn't great but it isn't bad, either. It's pretty good, on the whole. 6/10",0

About twenty minutes into the film I wondered how a two and half hour film could already feel so rushed. It had no atmosphere, it never felt like anyone stayed at any place long enough.

I think part of the film's failure is largely based on Carrie Fisher's death, as she was supposed to play a larger role. As a result, the pacing of the whole film is off. That being said, the writers abused the characters they had. We never really get to know the three leads, let alone seem them interact. You know less about Finn than in the beginning. The only redeeming character is Kylo Ren (mostly attributed to Adam Driver's acting, which outshines everyone else). Stop adding side characters that you'll just throw away - it makes it confusing and one-dimensional. Like Rose? What on purpose did she serve? Or Poe's mask-wearing friend? No one even knows her name. Or Finn's new friend with curly hair - again not memorable if I can't tell you her name. This movie just felt like a bad fan fiction in so many ways. Also Palpatine really? It's like Disney thought their audiences were really that dumb. It was the worst villain comeback of all time and still never addressed any of the big issues.

Kylo's helmet is destroyed but now it's put back together. Carrie Fisher in this movie just feels wrong. They should have had her character die in last Jedi because of the actors death. The movie is a disaster of a conclusion of the amazing Star Wars saga. So much happens in this movie in such a short amount of time and a lot of it is pointless.

When it finally got released on steelbook, I decided to give it another watch, and once again, I ended up falling asleep. Now, the thing that was great about the first 3 movies that were released in the saga, was the simplicity of the plot, and the brilliantly written humour, which made us feel for the characters, but every film thereafter, was a complete shambles. This movie, which is supposed to be the last in the franchise, was a poor way to bow out because the characters were weak and it lacked humour. It seemed like a constant goose chase from the beginning to the end, and the average action scenes, mixed with an uninteresting plot, was a terrible way to see the Star Wars saga end. When the big revelation of Rey's grandfather is revealed, I was left thinking, ""was that it?"", and the big battle scene towards the end, didn't have the punch and shock value that the first three movies did. On a lighter note, I loved the little puppet that erased C3PO's memory, Babu Frik, and the Princess Leia scenes were emotional. It was also good to see the return of the Death Star, which brought back some memories, and I was glad to see Han Solo & Luke Skywalker make a small appearance, but if you were to ask me what stood out in the movie, I really couldn't say. After watching the two and a half hour bonus material on the disk, I appreciate the effort that was put into directing and producing this epic film, but I must admit, I did find that more interesting than the movie. It did answer all of the lingering questions that Star Wars experts were asking, but it still didn't do it for me, especially after all of the time and anticipation I invested in this saga.

Even the stuff JJ set up in The Force Awakens is dropped and most of what Rian Johnson set up in The Last Jedi is completely ignored. There is essentially no plot or story to this film.

Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams had the opportunity to make something great, but they completely failed. their trilogy is irrelevant and should not be considered part of the Skywalker Saga. all the Skywalkers were killed off, and Mary Sue Palpatine took their name and their home. it's disrespectful to the legacy of STAR WARS and needs to be erased from canon and forgotten.",0

I'm a massive star wars fan all my life and I was sceptical after The last Jedi but I really thought this delivered. It did everything right. The battles the humour everything. It had a Disney like finish but it's the last episode of 9. There had to be a conclusion and an end and I think it was captured wonderfully. I think if Star wars fans go and see it as a film and stop nit picking and questioning everything that happens they would enjoy their movies a lot better.

This movie has just so much to give you.... if you are into expensive but honest trash B-movies they would have been ashamed to make in the 80s.

I have been a fan of the original trilogy all my life and consider 'Empire' to be one of my top 3 movies of all time. Too bad Disney just did a giant cash grab, I guess they banked in and killed at the same time that last nostalgia that we all had. I wouldn't go see another Star Wars film (Rogue One and Mandalorian seem to be flukes), and Ep. IX is the only one (besides Ep.I and Solo) that I never saw twice in the theatres... The pointlessness of the whole trilogy cannot be understated, Episode 8 adds so nothing to the actual story, that my parents never saw it, yet they had no problem following Ep. IX. Jar Jar Abrahms, made one good film, Star Trekm (2009) - clearly by accident, but everything else he's done is completely derivative. Ep. VII is just a remake of 'Star Wars' (and no I am NOT calling it ""A New Grope""). The whole dyad plot thing and the stupid Star Destroyers that can't fly or shoot at anything (their tech seems to move backwards), and the God awful of bringing the Emperor back and Finn having no lines except to call out 'Rey!' over and over... to the finding McGuffin chase they needed to find the main McGuffin, which was all pointless in the end... God, please kill me. The Effects were cool though, that why it got 2 stars instead of 1. This movie has more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The last we saw Ren's helmet it was sitting in the bottom of the elevator in pieces, you're telling me it wasn't immediately thrown away by some maintenance guy? Someone actually picked up the pieces of Ren's broken helmet and KEPT THEM?!? WTF?!? For god's sake why would they do that? To bringing back the pointless 'Knights of Pointless' - that didn't do anything. Now near the end Ren gets hit in FACE and body numerous times by the brutal bludgeoning weapons the 'Knights of Ren' carry, (why is he even fighting with them? They follow Palpatine all of sudden for no reason?) yet experiences no death... he crashed his TIE and lives... I HATE THIS MOVIE MORE THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT",0

The directing was excellent the writing could've been better but it wasn't a flop!

The key thing about these films, both from George Lucas, was that Lucas had, as he asserted, made quality of story the central ingredient. That really meant something to the audience of that time.

There's only the cash register and your stupid money. This kasustu to dig in the magil very good and oskvernenii franchise. But Disney is not to blame, Disney did not promise anything to anyone.

With the exception of a few light sabers thrown in, nothing here has anything to do with the original and creative George Lucas' Star Wars saga. Abrams certainly knows how to waste a lot of people's money and time. A shameful ignoble end to what was a phenomenal franchise.

Bringing back old characters is always a great move but just to showcase them in the previews to generate sales Come on. It was both satisfying to see the end but the entire trilogy could of been better and should of been taking into consideration it was the end to the saga.

This time the evil Emperor Palpatine is on board the Death Star overseeing the construction himself along with his prodigy Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones). Like in the first Star Wars movie (Episode IV), there is a huge celebration by the Rebels for their victory over the Galactic Empire and the motley crew of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) are awarded medals for saving Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from what would have been certain death at the hand of Lord Vader.",1

Only the employment of 1m bots saved the IMDB rating. No human rated it above a 3/10 (I gave it 1/10). And so, for this finale. I almost didn't watch it after the shocking part-2, but I'm glad I did. My daughter gave it a 7/10. There were few surprises, and these were good. The ending is akin to GoT, and decently done.

True enemy. AND HOW SHE BECOMES THE TRUE LEGENDARY JEDI.",1
564,1.0,"What a terrible movie. Kathleen Kennedy, you need to step down. She clearly has no understanding of Star Wars. Let me begin by saying this is not an attack on feminism or J.J Abrams but this film is awful. Ignore the ratings that are above 4 of out 10.<br /><br />The whole film apologizes for The Last Jedi and tells you something completely different from what that film did. Then it attempts to cram everything else into a boring 2.5 hours. The scene where Kylo Ren visits The Emperor is one of the worst scenes ever in a Star Wars film. The Emperor tells him that he cheated death and then mimics a line from The Revenge of the Sith. No actual explanation how he survived being thrown 5 thousand feet to his death by Darth Vader in The Return of the Jedi and then completely obliterated on the Death Star when it blew up at the climax of that movie. I'm pretty sure George Lucas was saying that this is the end of the Death Star and everything on it. This was such a bad case of desperation to bring back The Emperor because Rian Johnson killed off Snoke.<br /><br />J.J Abrams work in the past has been good. I like the Star Trek Reboot and is one of the best reboots I have seen along with Casino Royale and I also liked MI:3 but he has completely messed up this film that clearly had no direction of where to go as a trilogy. This trilogy's desperate attempt to inject feminism into the saga has backfired terribly. Kathleen Kennedy saying that these films have strong independent women has been a blatant lie. Rey is the worst character in the whole of the 9 star wars films. Having a character and saying that she is brilliant at everything and cannot be defeated and anything, train herself as a jedi and beat someone who is trained with the dark side of the force is just ridiculous. Her character was already fully developed after The Force Awakens. Her force powers are even more stronger is this film that they were in the last film. Finn again has nothing to do in this film. His wardrobe has gone through a more interesting arc than he has.<br /><br />There are great things that you can do with a diverse cast if you have a brilliant script. Spiderman: Into The Spider-Verse and HBO's Watchmen are just 2 examples!!<br /><br />In the end this all about a corporation wanting to make more money and have no understanding of what makes Star Wars great. Where is use to be about a great vision of a bright young Director, it has now become money making scheme to cram all of it's political correctness down your throat",0

I came away quite content. I don't know for certain, but Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise if Skywalker could be the most purely entertaining of all the Disney Star Wars films. It's fun and adventurous, and not so smug, so already it's a far superior replica of the real Star Wars than The Last Jedi was. The dreadful dourness and awkwardly small structure of that film are replaced with a globe-hopping adventure story that feels in line with what a Star Wars movie ought to do.

With the references to Dune and Portal games, I'm honestly considering that he actually hates Star Wars and wanted to troll the fans.<br /><br />Stat Wars never was a Scifi movie or strong on logic, but it mostly made sense within the confines it set up for itself (what can the force do, the dark side's strategies to take over or to flip heros to their side. Well, not in this one, let's break to rules of the Universe for the last two hours of the Saga for completely unnecessary twists, and make wild illogical happenings into a ""master plan"" thag was going on all along.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, the big answer on Rey's origin, well the timeline doesn't really fit or it would need a whole lot of explanation but there was basically none.",0

I attended the other two recent movies in the same cinema also at midnight screenings and for some reason this one just didn't have the same excitement around it.

It really just plays like an action movie. Which is no what these are supposed to be about. There is zero emotional content. This is supposed to be the resolution of a 40 year franchise and it just seems clang to a halt. It's not that the story doesn't resolve, its just that on an emotional level, it doesn't.<br /><br />This is partly to do with the sheer pace which things happen. Everything is so crammed in there's no space to breathe. This is a three hour plus movie crammed into just over two. You simply don't get the time to emotionally engage with the plot or characters which leaves it a bit of an empty experience. Also the story is far too similar to Jedi, it's just been done with 2019 special effects. The fact it's nothing new story wise also makes this feel like a wasted opportunity. It's one thing reference previous movies but 90% of this movie is from the first three. I think this episode will lead to a game of thrones response, I can see a petition to have this remade.

He's not supposed to be doing that, hes supposed to be flying a SHIP!

602,,First this is not a bad movie at all..But the problem might be at the length of the movie giving difficult choices to the director.2 hours movie would make anyone cutting stuff out and making short fast dizzy scenes to finish it up.3 hours movie and extended scenes would help.Some scenes and action are perfect while the last 30 minutes of the movie is fast loud and explosive.And probably that is where the bad reviews are coming from<br /><br />Then Rey's identity reveal at the 3rd movie is a cheap commercial trick and could be revealed much sooner and build the story around it<br /><br />Quality is great overall.<br /><br />I did not like the 2nd movie at all but this is far better.<br /><br />I hope we get more Star War movies.,0

I took a look at the first episode and I did find myself more engaged then I though I'd be. It's also the first thing Star Wars related that people seem to genuinely agree is amazing without another side claiming it to be the worst thing.

605,5.0,"I'm a massive Star Wars fan and couldn't wait for this final episode in the Skywalker saga. This film is totally incoherent to the last Jedi. It shows that they had different writers with each of the films. Disney got Marvel so right with Kevin Feige overseeing the films. They got it so wrong with the final Star Wars films as they definitely would have benefitted having someone overseeing the story arch. It's such a crying shame as there was so so much potential for these films to be revered as classics. The prequel films over time have gained respect, I don't think these will. The rise of Skywalker doesn't feel like a film that's actuality been shot, it just simply feels like someone's found some unused footage and put it together to get a film out.

I laughed out aloud at many scenes because of how stupid they were, how they destroyed the lore, logic and any reason.

619,2.0,"Well, time to ruin everyone's Christmas. Hold onto your butts people, this is a long one. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a huge train wreck. I've seen a lot of movie catastrophes, and it's pretty rare and funny to see a film that was so miscalculated, like the Justice League. It's a big, rushed sloppy mess and the ultimate example of how not to plan your trilogy. It's like playing a fetch-quest video game, only you're not enjoying it. It's the living embodiment of everything and the kitchen sink; whatever we got, throw it in there. The Last Jedi felt like some college students thesis statement on Star Wars, and this one feels like one of those big cork boards with a bunch of pictures and threads connecting to each other, like the one a nutjob conspiracy theorist would make. The whole movie is written as a response to all the negative criticism Last Jedi got, instead of being written for fun or to create a compelling story. That's not how you write a movie. Batman v. Superman and Justice League did the exact same thing, and they're both considered some of the worst blockbusters ever. and The whole thing moves by so fast that you can't process what's happening, as it's rushing to the finish line. This movie is Justice League in every sense of the word. It wants to make you completely forget the film that came before it, but just ends up falling flat on its face in attempting to fix it. It ends up falling into an even bigger mess. I suppose we should be happy that this film is trying to fix the Last Jedi, but every creative choice for it just adds to the mess. Not attempting to write a cohesive, compelling trilogy is the fault of everyone on board the production, and any new ideas they had to try to fix it are either completely baffling or dumber than a doornail. There were a good number of rumors swirling the movie, and each one I heard was worse than the last, and most of them came true. I don't think I can give them points for trying to fix it, because I couldn't stand their ideas and it just contributes to an even bigger, complicated mess. While the visuals partially save the movie, it doesn't feel like it's enough at the same time. There's good cinematography, great atmosphere, and some decent production design, alien effects, and practicality to everything, and some good moments. It feels so tiring saying all the effects is good for a Star Wars movie, because that tends to be the only good stuff anymore. It just feels like for every positive that comes up, more negatives take its place.<br /><br />The whole cast does what they can amid the burning wreckage. Boyega has charisma, but he's at his most irritating, Poe is more interesting in this one than the other films, and Daisy Ridley does the best she can with a completely underwritten character. Adam Driver is the most interesting character and is the rock holding up the entire franchise. Ian McDiarmid is fun as the Emperor, and he's completely hamming it up for our enjoyment. The only characters not ruined were Lando and Chewie. Billy Dee Williams just brings his signature cool. One of the worst character moments in the movie is Carrie Fisher, who could have had a real emotional moment, but it fails completely. The cyanide cherry on top is a young CGI Leia and Luke brought in to ruin Leia's background even more. All of our characters end up not doing anything in the movie, and most of them have no impact in the plot. It makes for a never-ending frustration. Even John Williams' score has been pretty forgettable for the last three films.<br /><br />All the questions I had are never answered and the movie feels like it's insulting me for asking. Plot points come and go so fast that you're not giving time to process any of it, and things just happen because they can at the drop of a hat. Nothing makes sense, especially with the Emperor, and we'll go to our graves wondering what happened and why. Since Avengers: Endgame is the gold standard for blockbuster endings, this movie wanted to be Endgame so badly, that it just ripped it off. So much crap is thrown on the screen at the end that it's headache inducing. It's Throwaway Line the movie, where everything is brushed aside in one swift stroke, and any plot point that comes up is immediately resolved in the next scene. They just want you to ignore it and enjoy the spectacle. It's over stimulating, over compensating and a complete disaster. I think we're all a little happier that the franchise is over. Avengers: Endgame, the perfect ending to a monumental franchise, except this one ended on a real whimper. It also doesn't get credit for replicating the exact ending of Return of the Jedi. All three movies just rehashed the original films and it shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity. The funniest part of the film is when it went full Independence Day in the end. Never go full Independence Day.<br /><br />I think we'll always get more Star Wars projects, but our enthusiasm is done. Some may be good, some may be bad, but we're all just getting tired. Force Awakens is still the best film, but the whole trilogy feels like a huge waste of potential. It's more and more I feel that Spaceballs is the best Star Wars movie, just like Galaxy Quest is the best Star Trek movie.",0

This particular episode has a little bit of everything JJ Abrams did before: mystery from Lost, science magic from Fringe and nonsense from Revolution etc. But that is not SW. This is mostly within fantasy genre now. Inquisitor and his knights, dynasties, animal whispering, healers, portals ... housewives with rolling-pins rushing into attack on space lawn-mowers. What a ride. A lot of money spent, I give them that. But not well spent unfortunately. Troopers still can't shoot. Main characters don't die. Secondary humanoid characters are more stupid than droids and they die abundantly but they don't care at all. Sad. All grandpas and grandmas, and E.T.'s granddaughter had their cameos, that's good, maybe, no. They'll keep filming this again and again until the end of times, I'm sure.

Thank god for the mandalorian and that us star wars fans have something to hold on to, perhaps the people making that should take over the whole star wars brand and begin again with a more attention, thought, care, respect, and planning into what they are creating.

It definitely dose not deserve all the hate it gets but it dosent deserve a lot of praise the action is amazing along with the non cgi, practical effects there are also some interesting story plots and character development. But they all get cut short and dont go any where. I think what ruined this film and trilogy was that the didn't have a plan and after the first two they should have done a 4 movie run, I am one of the people that loved both of the previous films and thought that the last Jedi gets too much hat I thought it was perfect, it did just what empire did in its time it subverted expectations but for some reason people didnt like it for that reason, but that film essentially ruins this one because this one JJ is so focused on trying to say F you to the previous one.",0

632,1.0,"It's mandatory that when reading reviews of Disney's Star Wars 9 that you familiarize yourselves with words like retcon; member-berries, McGuffins, ex-machina and my favorite new word exposition. (I never heard of any of these words until Disney's Star Wars came along.) Exposition/expound? Don't know what exposition means? Well, it's Finn AKA Mr. Exposition basically. It's someone who has to explain something out loud even though we've seen it with our own eyes firsthand. You see, Finn feels the need to interpret its meaning verbally to the moviegoer as we're too stupid to comprehend what's happening on the screen for ourselves apparently. It's a translator of some sorts...kind of.<br /><br />Neil Breen could have directed something far better than this story wise. But what can you expect with JJ Abrams at the helm? (What does JJ stand for anyway - Just Joking?)<br /><br />I've reserved extra special thanks in my closing statements to Lucas Film big boss Kathleen Kennedy - way to go, lady, you were more concerned about espousing your political persuasions over actual science fiction storytelling and it's backfired drastically. Serves you right.<br /><br />Hope ya sell lots of toys this Christmas though, Disney. But then again you can't do anything right when it comes to the field of Star Wars as evident by not having any plush Baby Yoda material for sale this year.

633,3.0,"The way this new trilogy butchers Star Wars is something that amazed me more and more as I watched each new piece of garbage that came out. The force awakens was bad, it ruined Han Solo and it just seemed to be heading the wrong way, however, there was still some hope left, It didn't kill Star Wars. The second piece of garbage, the last jedi, pretty much was unwatchable. First time it was fine because of all the special effects but the more time passed the more the plot hits you with every little piece of crap detail and idiotic story, characters that are not the same as in the old movies and just the whole mess that movie is... By the end it seemed like there was nothing that could be worse that could follow, or that could fix it. Well, I guess it was a ""challenge accepted""moment because oh, it got worse. This last one is just a mess, totally incoherent and all over the place and completely takes a massive crap on the old trilogy. The emperor is now back (are u f'n kiddin me?), nothing matters anymore, the whole action of episode 6 is worthless, as is Darth Vaders' sacrifice and redemption. The whole thing is just stupid, it's idiotic, oh my God, why did they have to do this to the greatest movie of our childhood? why did they set out to ruin it? why? how does this movie have more than a 5 as a rating? ok, I get it, if you don't know the old story and you are all into special effects and would watch anything just to waste some time, sure, this is great, good special effects, fun to watch, although dumb and incoherent, but as a star wars fan you should be appalled... I will never consider this new crap to be Star Wars, it just seems like a bad dream. Do not buy their merchandise and do not go see anymore of the movies, they deserve to be boycotted.

652,1.0,"This one is probably the least annoying of the Disney-era Star Wars (and that's not saying much). After they ripped-off the original Star Wars in Force Awaken, after they went prequel-bad on Last Jedi, JJ Abrams went back to Star Wars' roots and finally created something that feels more like a new film that continues the old trilogy. The problem is that it's boring as heck. If I had been watching it on Netflix instead of a theater I probably would have skipped a lot of it, and some of it action sequence. Maybe Star Wars is just creatively bankrupt, but the most exciting ideas they could have was to paint some costumes and sets red.",0
653,5.0,"The first act is rushed although visually gripping at times. Everyone has to find objects to get to a location so they can battle someone basically. A lot of scenes aren't all too memorable due to flashy spectacle and the sense that the film is trying to cater/play catch-up to an incoherent vision throughout the trilogy. The dynamic between Kylo and Rey has been one of the redeeming and most attractive character chemistry aspects in all of Star Wars for me; however they didn't stick the landing by the time they fought Palpatine. That whole action sequence was a letdown but the point being with how they had Kylo (now Ben by this time) force fade away after transferring life-force energy was unnecessary. They kiss for the first time and it works because the chemistry is just undeniably there. Although I could see it feeling off for some people just given that a lot of other things fell flat by the end of the movie. Anyway, Ben could have easily stayed alive and the romance/partnership of these two would have culminated into something grand. We waited to see how they'd transpire, and instead of a proper send off with Ben by her side in the end -- he just awkwardly lies down after resuscitating her via their somewhat innate ancient ability to use ""life force"" which was explained by one line from Palpatine. Maybe that particular shot of Ben passing just threw me but either way I hate their choice in having him die. Other notes: too much bickering between the squad, not really a joint feeling, Lando and many other moments came off as ""member-berries"". Kylo's helmet design looked like it was solely made for toy sales. Its ultra redness was distracting to look at. I enjoyed all of the lightsaber moments and duels aside from the dual lightsaber wielding face-off Rey had with Palpatine. Speaking of Palpatine, his entire plan was to have Rey succeed him by killing him? As I said before the whole final act could have been done far, far better. I was teetering around a 7/10 before the final act but it pretty much fell apart and genuine feelings were hard to come by given the looming, disjointed studio vibe throughout. So... 5/10 I liked half of it, but I'm letdown, so 5. Disney, word of advice from many fans: have a damn gameplan for a beloved franchise before crapping out a trilogy. The legacy of this trilogy will be muddled disjointed parts that could have been amazing if the proper time would have been put into it. Also, Kathleen Kennedy is the worst.",0

658,10.0,"After viewing this fine film by J.J. Abrams I am nonplussed by all the negative reviews. The critics apparently live in a parallel universe where stories are told from their perspective. Critics especially zeroed in on the resurrection of Emperor Palpatine. I thought it clever for Rey, whose backstory is not revealed in the previous two movies, to discover her lineage from Palpatine. Those who complain that Palpatine was killed in ""Return of the Jedi"" so now cannot possibly appear in this movie apparently don't believe in the immortal character of the spirit, which continues to exist after the death of the body. If the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker can live on after death, why can't Palpatine? In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Abrams was inspired by the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" the Dark Lord Sauron was killed, but his spirit lived on and kept looking for a way to become corporeal again.",1

I'm 100% sure that no one thought this was good while they were making it. Disney has run this whole thing into the ground, along with the anti white male thing that rules movies and TV now.

It's not a masterpiece by any means but it has far more positve than negative to it.<br /><br />It's certainly frantic with a lot crammed into the two and a quarter hours, it's an action packed ending to the saga. I always had the feeling with this trilogy that Kylo/Ben would end up turning to the good side of the force, though i felt that Rey would edge more towards the dark side with Kylo/Ben ultimately saving her, bringing her back to the light. I also felt Leia would be killed by Kylo/Ben and the guilt of that would be what brough him back to the light...So i wasn't a million miles off with that prediction( which i made after watching The Force Awakens).<br /><br />This did pretty much play out as expected with perhaps the exception of Palpatine making a return, (which contrary to what others may have thought) which wasn't the most stupid of concepts really.<br /><br />The ending was for me a bit convoluted...Ray dies, Kylo/Ben revives her only for him to them die and for his body to immediately turn spirit ( why did that not happen to Rey when she died??) A few minor grumbles but overall i felt this was a really good watch and a decent - if not prefect- end to the saga.

She is able to run fast, force heal, levitate any sized object, jump over Tie Fighters and cut them apart, channel Force lightning, summon Force lightning, pull moving ships back down with the Force, Force crush, fly any ship and translate any language. I mean, seriously? How can she possibly do that? Of course die hard fans and politically correct individuals are going to disagree, but its true; she's a ""Mary Sue."" Pulling off feats, that Anakin Skywalker in his prime, couldn't do; all with her only training for a year. Anakin trained for decades, Luke was a prodigy and still wasn't anywhere near this level. Luke was humiliatingly defeated by Vader, their first encountered. Rey was never even injured in this series, other than Snoke's Force pull in ""The Last Jedi.""",0

Palpatine was the icing on the cake for the end of Star Wars. The prophecy of Anakin bringing balance to the force is destroyed and meaningless. He doesn't kill Palpatine because Rey kills Palpatine for some reason. The worst message these movies bring is getting rid of the old and bringing in the new. Constantly bombarding this message knowingly. Destroying the ancient Jedi text for no reason, C3PO losing his memory, and R2D2 being unable to function. Disney uncanonized many stories and books that were canon before George gave Star Wars to Disney. It's an insult to the old characters in the original trilogy and the prequels. It's an insult to George Lucas. Remaking his work into a lesser version of the originals. It's an insult to Star Wars as a whole.",0
695,4.0,"The rise of Skywalker was mediocre at best. A very average movie full of surface level philosophy and fan service callbacks for the sake of arousing nostalgia in both OT fans and prequel fans. It was messy because they tried to fit so many things into the movie but didn't have the space for any meaningful amount of anything leaving every cameo to be around 20 seconds or less as they play some sort of John Williams happy/hopeful moment score to signify it's a significant moment rather than letting the watcher realize it for themselves. The problem with Star Wars as a whole is it was never meant to be a series. It was a standalone movie that due to capitalism got turned into unnecessary sequels and prequels, with the only option to finish the screenplay of each movie being to retcon the living hell out of it.",0

Rey Skywalker"" ""I am all the Sith! And I am all the JEDI"" are just a couple examples of moments that tried too hard and in the end coming off as cheesy. There were moments of shock... but then shortly after it was all undone, for example Chewbacca and Kylo Ren's death.",0

737,6.0,"Just for reference, I am a huge fan of the original 3 films, having grown up on them. I've seen the prequels once each due to their boring nature and cartoony digital effects. Not. Fan of them by any stretch. Episode 7 was a fun movie that seemed to set the franchise back on its magnificent footing. Only to be completely undone by the awful episode 8. Prequel level awful!!!<br /><br />This brings us to this movie. It is nowhere near as good as episode 7 and nowhere near as bad as episode 8. Some questions are left unanswered and some are answered extremely shabbily. Fan service helps but unfortunately there was too much of a mess left from episode 8 to try to reform the narrative and save this trilogy.<br /><br />It is a watchable movie that lightly reminds you of why Star Wars was at one time, a super special theatrical experience. Now it is just merely another movie that comes out and holds your attention for a couple hours. No more, no less.",0

742,1.0,"I literally just watched it to finish the trilogy and I feel I've wasted 2.5hrs of my life. So many parts of the film lifted and rehashed from the original films these films in particular Rise of Skywalker feels so weak in it's plot writing and that screen writers must have had so many mental blocks and just dropped in convenient moments to fill and move along an already bad film. Worst of all for me is Rey she's always thinks she knows everything and her character is infuriating how is she so powerful as Jedi? I mean it took Master Yoda centuries to get to his greatness and yet she did it all in a weekend the only convincing part to this is how unconvincing Rey truly is. Only true and believable characters are Po and Kylo Ren who truly to feel convincing and have depth. And the ending WOW so lame. Thank goodness for Rogue One and Solo, those films show how it should be done. Best thing that came from this film? The end credits.",0

And at most a tiny percentage of the audience even want him to be in this in the first place.

The characters did not stop talking or shouting not even for 10 seconds the entire movie. Even on a tv talk show there are moments of pause or silence. Very high paced for no reason. Scenes and unnecessary dialogue non stop that don't give the chance to the audience to admire a scene. Zero acting! Apart from Ben that had a couple good moments, all characters show no acting skill nore any likable traits. Honestly not only the worst Star wars but the worst movie I watched for years. It shames the star wars name. Do not waste your time there is nothing to see there. Just go watch the last 30 minutes to see the ending and you will not miss anything.",0

Whole triology was disaster and I wish they stayed as just poor movies but no. This triology is not only awful, but also it betrays all movies and tv shows before itself. It makes Luke Skywalker was nothing. Balance in the force doesnt happen, for instance. Please Disney If your profits that make from toys is done, take in charge and responsiblity and tell this is not way story will go to. Say you cancel this production and please bring the guys- who made Kotor and Jedi Fallen Order- to storyboard.",0

I will not say that the film was bad, but I will say that I am sincerely glad that this story is finally finished.",0
757,3.0,"This movie fails at all levels. It doesnt tell a good story, the story itself is a mess, the characters have no charisma and you can notice the actors dont even want to be there, it repeats the same mistakes its previous movies did, it brings back Emperor Palpatine out of nowhere, and its pretty clear nobody knew how to finish the trilogy. Its uninteresting and boring, the two things star wars should never be. The prequels could be boring from time to time, but they had their moments, this new trilogy and specially this new movie doesnt, there is no special moment that makes you remember why star wars became star wars, it just repeats the same story we have already seen in infinitely better ways. This movie also dares to introduce new characters and give them like 5 min of screentime and expect us to care about them. Nothing makes sense in this movie.",0

764,3.0,"I've always been a fan of Star Wars. The Original Trilogy is almost perfect and the Prequels are hilariously bad but the Sequel Trilogy has been pretty mediocre so far. So how does this final film wrap up the ENTIRE Skywalker Saga? Meh, very messy and mostly disappointing. If you like fan service or huge battles then you will probably love this but I was looking for a good story with good characters and the film mostly doesn't deliver on that level. The only new character I liked that has been consistently good throughout the entire trilogy is Kylo Ren. He is the only new character to go through an actual arc throughout the trilogy about who he is while the others haven't really gone through one. Finn had one in the first film but that was completely abandoned by this film. Rey and Poe haven't gone through any arc but I like Poe as a character more than Rey. The Original Trilogy characters are fine. They already completed their arcs and are here to help these new characters but I have a problem with one of them, Palpatine. Although I enjoyed his presence and Ian McDiarmid did a great job as usual, he really doesn't serve any purpose to the story other than to be there. It feels like a last minute decision to throw him into the film and I felt that this wasn't their original goal. Leia's presence was awkward in a few places but I can't fault the film for that because they did the best they could out of a bad situation. The new characters for this film only weren't that good either. They were introduced, used for the characters to get out of a situation or get into something and then were abandoned until the end. They really weren't fleshed out a lot and felt useless. The first hour of the film was incredibly clumsy, messy, and at some points confusing. The film slowly got better as time went along but it didn't get that much better. The first hour is our group of heros hopping from planet to planet and delivering exposition. That's it. The editing was really choppy and quick along with the transitions. Some scenes would switch to another character for a minute or less and then hop back to our core three characters. It felt awkward and very rushed which completely destroyed the pacing for the rest of the film because the rest of the film has much slower pacing. The film tries to fit a LOT of information into its 2 and a half hour runtime where it feels like the film should have been 3 and a half or 4 hours to fit all this information. The film introduced a new force power that was stupid to me. It felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and used this new force ability as a way to get out. The final climactic battle was kinda cool but it wasn't that impressive to me. In fact, most of the action wasn't that special compared to some of the other action scenes in the other films. The battle between Rey and Kylo over the ocean was kinda cool but most of the other action scenes felt uninspired. The acting for the most part was pretty great. Adam Driver did a great job and so did the Original Trilogy characters. Although I wasn't a big fan of their characters, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac did a pretty good job. As always, the music by John Williams is fantastic. This man can never screw up Star Wars music. The visuals are pretty great also. The planets looked great and so did the ships and action sequences. Some of the alien creatures were practical which I felt was a really nice touch. I really enjoyed and appreciated some of the fan service moments. I won't spoil any of them for you but I had a smile on my face when those moments happened. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing ending to the Skywalker Saga with choppy editing, transitions, uninspired action, and rushed story but retains its good acting, visuals, and music with some good fan service moments to leave viewers happy.",0

Sure, The Last Jedi wasn't great, but at least it had some great scenes and cool ideas, and all the characters had stuff to do. In this movie, the only people who do anything are Kylo and Rey. Everyone else just follows them for NO REASON. The script is also awful. This movie just feels rushed and flawed. They brought back JJ Abrams to try and make an ending out of the last two movies. Maybe if Ryan Johnson directed this, the movies would have connected and had a coherent story it would have been good.",0
771,1.0,"This film, like so many of the othe star wars films is terrible. It uses the same premise and the same ideas, characters and plot structure. If I wasn't such a big fan of the original three I'd have stopped watching after those three. They try to destoy the death star as they did in four films as if that wasn't enough. Now, they are trying to create a politically sensitive plot that uses people from all colors and creeds just to be PC. Why not keep to the fact that there are species from all over the galaxy with colors, creeds and ideals unique to each planet or area? This film is garbage. Trying to have a woman be sky walker. Fine, but aren't there already bad ass women in each galaxy without trying so hard to bring a human life form who's a woman into the series. She has no discernable characteristics that make her unique and she has not trained with Yoda or any other iconic Jedi's' . She has nothing to offer that makes us believe she an be the last hope for the rebellion. She has no allies who are bad ass as well. She's just some girl who has no skills outside her basic lightsaber skills. Plus there are no new villains or anyone that makes us want to care about her. She is a random character with allies who also no one cares about. STAR Wars has gone down hill since Empire and although Clones had some sweet scenes and a new plot, it too was lacking. Lucas and his producers are lazy at best and need new ideas to produce a back story that makes us care. It's a garbage film and I could care less about this girl. Why not have a sweeet protagonist, regardless of gender who progresses the plot? This is a trash film as were the last four. WE GET IT, they have a death star that you need to infiltrate in the same old way, and when that plot doesn't work, as it hasn't for some time, have a character who is unique and makes us care. Lucas needs to watch the Mandalorian which is amazing!. This film is a giant pass for me and anyone invested in the Star Wars franchise. ten giant thumbs down. Plain old garbage.",0

782,10.0,I loved this film. CGI was great. Was emotional at points eg. when C3PO had his memory wiped. Overall a great way to end the series.,1
783,5.0,"I think the 1 and 2 star reviews are a bit harsh. I was expecting this movie to be worse, and found myself pleasantly surprised, especially in the first half, that it was at least engaging. But I watched it less than 24 hours ago and I already forgot most of what transpired.<br /><br />The Last Jedi got a lot of flack for going in crazy story directions but I found that to be that movies greatest asset. It was surprising, and the scenes in that movie, three years later, are still in my head. Luke's attitude in that movie didn't make sense and I was disappointed in that, but otherwise it was a great and exciting movie.<br /><br />This movie is just serviceable. Some funny moments, like c-3po temporarily losing his memory, but thete was A LOT of cheesy dialogue, particularly from Po. Oscar Isaac is a good actor but he didn't look like one in this, probably because his dialogue was so stupid and childish. Action sequences were decent but not as good as the previous film, which was epic. And the force powers in this movie were overboard.somehow Leah flying through space in the previous film was more believable than Rey pulling a ship out of the sky. And Palpatine coming back from the dead was dumb. So who was the emperor in the original movies? (Ep 4-6). I'm not a super fan and I don't know all the details of the universe but I still had these questions.",0
784,1.0,"Whether you're a fan or not, there is so many things wrong with this movie that I found 140 things that were simply broken about the movie. I wouldn't even consider myself a fan either but to have a Hollywood budget, and find 140 things that were entirely broken about this is tragic.<br /><br />Have I seen the previous movies? Yes! It is because of those previous movies that helped to set the stage for how much of a failure this movie was. Inconsistency is a big reason that a movie franchise like Star Wars, Marvel, etc. can stumble over, yet with the budget that Hollywood uses on their movies, we'd think those would be minimized as much as possible. In this movie, they only seem to stack on the inconsistency over and over.<br /><br />This leads me to believe the political agenda behind the scenes and through out was more important than telling a rich story, with depth and meaning to a franchise that meant a lot to millions of people. This seems like a schill not only to put an agenda in people's faces (as if we're blind) and to steal the cash from our hands without a regard to the customers they were serving.<br /><br />Sometimes there is a movie that does things like this movie did, and they flopped. The only reason this has any weight in the theater is because of it's meaning to those millions of fans, and millions of other viewers following the series. Hollywood has learned how to dupe the fans of series to pay for movies that are sub-par and substandard.<br /><br />Save yourself the trouble of paying for flashy effects and poor writing, and very little acting. It's has poor dialogue, and the entire thing keeps you from feeling involved, or relatable.

The new characters aren't that likeable and they do try their best but they have nothing on the original cast. It's a stunning film with brilliant CGI and visual effects and cinematography.

As a result it's an incoherent mess that deliveres only on humour in early stage of the movie - after a while even humour becomes forced to the point the whole project seems like a failed attempt at parody - and starts to be funny in a whole different over-the-top ridiculous way.<br /><br />Movie juggles with characters forced backstories and motivations, seemingly more out of obligation than a real need to tell a story.<br /><br />Plot seems to be a monstrous mix of double-what-The-Force-Awakens mainly consisted of - double the coincidence, double the in-your-face exposition and double the bland-interactions-between-the-characters-that-mostly-consists-of-shouting, dialogue that makes the prequels seem like they were written by Shakespeare.<br /><br />It treats audience members as idiots or people that have severe lack of ability to focus or process information - thus need to be told IN A VERY DIRECT AND LOUD WAY through both visual and sound what is going on, and why characters behave the way they do.<br /><br />It's similar to Game of Thrones Season 8 finale - it takes a deep drop to the ground level in terms of quality and characters' motivation and coherence, but when in case of Game of Thrones it's 10-storey building jump that has a serious impact, here it's like stepping off the curb - previous entries of the Trilogy has not much to offer either.",0

Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Mandalorian (series) it's finally time for the last one to date The Rise Of The Skywalker. It's been a rollercoaster watching this saga, with some really good ones (The Force Awakens, The Mandolarian) but also with some disappointments (A New Hope, Rogue One and The Last Jedi) but the worst one must be The Rise Of Skywalker. What a disappointment this last movie, an awful script (without a question the worst Star Wars story yet), a story that made me want to have a vomit bucket next to me. I watched the eleven movies plus The Mandalorian in five days, so it's all fresh to compare, but never was I this glad to see the end credits appear than with The Rise Of Skywalker. I'm actually glad this was the last one (at least for now) because I don't think I could watch one more now, certainly not of this low quality. The CGI's were great though, that's the only reason I score it a six, otherwise it would be lower. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. But now I think they should leave it like this, call it a day, maybe just continue with The Mandalorian which has great potential, but as for the movies maybe it's time to stop before you ruin it completely. Did i become a Star Wars geek after these five days? No, absolutely not, I did enjoy the saga though but that's about it, time to move on.",0

The movie has no regard for every established rule in the Star Wars universe as it goes on and changes many from hyperspace travel to the way the force works.

811,3.0,I love Star Wars. I have since I was a kid. The only good thing this sequel trilogy had going for it was The Last Jedi. JJ abrams completely tanked the final episode. It was so random and over the top. Where was the characterization? Where was the storytelling. I felt nothing. No emotion at all. Was this a fast and furious movie? Lmao. Huge fail.,0
812,2.0,Recycled and cannibalized ideas from previous films with no real direction. Hollywood has made statements by using as many women as possible and in one scene does something abominable! This is no longer about the vision George Lucas once had but now a platform for politically correct BS. Not even Star Trek ever did that. I thankfully did not pay to see this. Don't waste your hard earned money,0
813,2.0,I am your grandfather!,0
814,8.0,Ignore reviews that give you 1/10 or 10/10 This movie is neither great of bad. JJ always had an uphill struggle with the mess that was created in TLJ and had to undo a lot of it within 2h20m as well as wrap up everything from the original trilogy at the same time so there are always going to be people that don't understand this and give a stupid 1/10 score. The plot is basic and by the end you're left barely satisfied but is understandable. This movie was never going to wow people or leave them blown away so if you expect that then yes you'll be disappointed but if you go into it with half a brain you'll be left satisfied.,0
815,1.0,The force awakens didn't establish an interesting story. the last jedi didn't establish anything interesting either and so the conclusion isn't interesting.<br /><br />Palpatine's presence was a cheap attempt at fan service that didn't make sense.<br /><br />The end of the saga has no more depth than that the bad guys are dead and the good guys hug each other.,0

819,1.0,"Compared to 7-8 the film is less boring but in general for the star wars series is another bull**t film. They represented the power of the force like superpower of xmen, now you can do everything with the force and easily, you can absorb energy like Dragon Ball or you can resurrect who die, now also you can teleport objects with the force. For the film (cgi, effect etc) i vote 7/10 but for the star wars saga aspect the film is 1/10",0

821,5.0,"It looks that JJ made some effort to try and fix whatever was left of the trilogy, but it was a very hard job. Movie feels like a cross between Star Wars, Twilight and Harry Potter, and looks like a Marvel flick. Very awkward pacing, as plot is just characters going from one place to another, very brief visits and even new and old characters and planets get, at most, five minutes screentime. Of course Rey is vindicated and becomes potentially the most powerful Jedi that ever lived. Some scenes are blatant rip-off (sorry, homages) of OT scenes. This feels like when you are trying to clean some mess in your report or homework, and end up tearing the sheet of paper, then putting it back together with scotch tape.

With the 9-film cycle now concluded with this film, I look back and count a total of 3 decent films; let's be honest, 33% is not a great hit rate (Return Of The Jedi, and the first two films in this latest trilogy). This one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad story-telling, a whole load of deus ex-machina that reach the level of absurd, and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din. I'm kind of glad it's all over, to be honest.",1

The key to original was the humour and the wonder, none of this is in this film. The first 30 minutes seems to be a panic mismatch that was just boring, it gets better but not much. Why isn't the duo R2D2 and C3P0 in it more - you suspect it's cos the plot line was driven by Toy sales to sell that round one, whatever he is called. I watched the original with my Dad when I was ten, we both came out buzzing. Today I came out with my kid and he said - 'all that did was made me realise how good the original is were and I want to watch them again', I agreed.

Why did they make it look like C-3PO was dead, but then he wasn't? HOW DID PALPATINE SURVIVE FALLING DOWN A PIT AND THE SECOND DEATH STAR BLOWING UP? I spent the movie asking questions and rewinding because it was going way too fast. A planet here, a McGuffin there, sprinkle in some Force lightning, here's some random characters.

The first 6 movies (or episodes) were nice but not in my top 10.<br /><br />This is the most inconsistent trilogy I've ever seen and it's pretty obvious that they didn't have a plan on how these movies will play out. Episode 7 goes on one direction, then Episode 8 takes a different route and Episode 9 almost makes Episode 8 pointless.<br /><br />George Lucas confirmed that Palpatine had died in the first six movies and balance had been restored in the universe, which this movie changed completely. Why does Rey have healing powers and when did she learn to use that skill? Apparently all it takes to defeat Palpatine (who had taken his full strength back) is to have two lightsabers instead of one.<br /><br />There was no reason for Leia and Kylo to die, why couldn't Rey just use her healing powers to stop it from happening? Also, why did Kylo vanish?<br /><br />They never toid us what Finn wanted to tell Rey.<br /><br />The only good idea in this trilogy was the fact that Kylo and Rey were able to communicate and transfer objects, feel each other's emotions etc.<br /><br />Finally, it's pretty obvious that throughout this whole trilogy the writers were doing things that had been done before in the previous films because they were either afraid to take risks or they don't have any ability to think of a compelling plot on their own.<br /><br />To sum up, avoid watching this garbage cash-grab trilogy and stick to the original 6 episodes.",0

I wasn't disappointed one bit. How they kept Carrie Fishers character alive in the film was wonderful, a great ending to a character that I've watched since I was a little girl. Who I wanted to be. I've never felt so much tension and excitement in a Star Wars film until now. Wonderful new characters and ending of a few.<br /><br />I will certainly watch it again. Maybe not in 3D this time though. Well done in such a fantastic way to finish a well loved franchise. Would love to see more, but they said that they were only going to do nine and they've done nine.

879,1.0,"I actually have enjoyed the sequel trilogy, I'm not a ""hater"" but this was not a satisfactory ending to the Skywalker saga. It actually had the worst possible ending. The story felt rushed and convoluted... the main protagonists spend over an hour looking for the sith way finder that only gets destroyed and serves absolutely no purpose. I hated how Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was handled, as well as his relationship with Rey. The whole point of the last Jedi was to build up a relationship between the two of them, only to have them fight each other for about 90% of the movie and Rey would have actually killed him if she didn't have some new force healing ability. All the stories from the past two movies and comics from Lucasfilm we're painting Ben Solo to be a sympathetic character, only for him to die and we see no one mourn him or speak of him again, even after risking his life to help Rey defeat Palpatine and ultimately sacrificing himself for her to live. It was just a really disappointing ending. I realize JJ had his work cut out for him making this movie, but overall, it just feels underwhelming from a story telling perspective. Feels like the sequel trilogy is incomplete because the main focus seemed to be wrapping up all 9 films instead of telling a good story about the characters we've come to love in the past 6 years. Star Wars is a fairytale and I guess I was expecting a happy ending... nope",0

But this one is just not right, I truly felt embarrased of it. For starters, I have to state that I have no issues with the characters, I actually like them at all, but this movie just wasted their potential and threw away anything interesting that could have added something more to the story. But they chose to go the easy way and fill up the movie with cliches and nostalgia. I'm okay with the last thing, since mostly the whole new trilogy has used nostalgia as a factor, probably to call old fans attention. But what is the necessity of keep bringing back old characters that already died? I mean, Luke and Han had amazing last scenes, just let them be already for Vader's sake. The cliche part is easier to explain, the kiss, Hux being the spy, and the last act being exactly the same as Avengers Endgame's ending.

The first one, detailing the overthrow of the evil Galactic Empire. The second one, detailing how the Empire first came to power. And the third, detailing how the remnants of the Empire were finally eradicated, once and for all.",1

The line was a few hundred people long and despite my impatience, it was worth the wait.<br /><br />I loved the original movie, Empire and even the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi (I was 12).<br /><br />Over decades I watched the trilogy many times and was excited when the prequels were announced.<br /><br />Sadly the prequel movies were, in my opinion, crap. So when the sequel trilogy was announced I was less enthused. But The Force Awakens wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it was at least fun to watch. Sadly the Last Jedi was painfully bad - so bad in fact that for the first time in my personal history I didn't go see it in the opening week, nor the second week. In fact I didn't bother seeing it in theaters at all. Episode 8 was that bad.<br /><br />So now I've watched it on Amazon Prime and Episode 9 was pretty good, much of the movie draws from Timothy Zahn's ""Thrawn"" novels with the resurrected emperor and the dark fleet. Maybe that's why it's so much better than the last 5 movies.<br /><br />Rise of Skywalker has it's flaws but overall it's at least as good as Return of the Jedi.",0

His only accomplishment was having leia and luke, which drove him to the dark side in the 1st place so I guess he was doomed from the start. Poor guy... 30 years of legacy and one of the best characters in fiction RIP in one movie.<br /><br />I mean just think of it like this One palatine becomes the embodiment of all Sith that existed (pretty cool idea if they developed it more) and the other palapatine becomes his exact opposite by becoming all the Jedi s.

Then theirs the twist what a joke the ultimate bad guy is the grandfather of rey its like come on noone is going to take that seriously. Then all off a sudden there doing the classic jesus miracle where rey litterly brings someone who's mortality wounded back to life. Just try and let that sink in and the way palpatine goes again it really is insulting and Disney really domt have a clue.

911,5.0,"Even though there were elements of this movie that were beyond ridiculous (i.e. Palpatine (I'm back!) and where did that 'largest fleet of absurdly over-powered star destroyers in the galaxy' come from), it was not the intelligence insulting abomination that The Last Jedi was. It had some genuinely interesting moments and largely got back to the 'used universe' that made the original unique. Now I understand why so many directors quit these movies for 'creative differences'. I expect it is because they are largely Disney board of directors written. This is not the end to end excellence of Rogue One or the Mandalorian, but it's watchable and maybe even re-watchable for the interesting elements thrown in. If you are a Star Wars fan you will be going to see this no matter what it was, but fortunately it is watchable and interesting on a scene by scene basis.

And if I didn't want to watch it i don't have to, but every time that I watch Star Wars, this wonder tags along awkwardly, and blasts a clean gaping hole in the story that the other 6 movies that weren't garbage-written sequels, had been trying to tell.

The story is hilarious and childish that doesnt make sense, like supposedly enemies and the next minute rey was unbelievably in love with ren, and then she goes back to finn afterwards which is unconvincing and coercive. While a bit of supernatural powers for the jedi is entertaining, overpowering them too much becomes ridiculous and laughable especially for rey and luke who is obviously out of shape for shooting. The series is most certainly disappointing to fans and I'd expect more from a star wars franchise, which has now become a laughable children movie, thanks disney.",0

The whole massed army of unflyable ships, each with bigger design fault than the death star (have they not learned!), I was kinda pleased for Kylo at the end. If Rogue One taught us anything, strong, simple storylines, with good character development, and some CGI and action go along way. Each of the films in this trilogy lack that. It was an average way to bow out and has all the hallmarks of a Disney politically correct, marketing machine led fest, soulless, misses George Lucas. Sorry.",0

954,5.0,This is one frustrating movie because it attempts to course correct the worst aspects of the nasty man hating self righteous Last Jedi and to save the huge missteps Kathleen Kennedy allowed or maybe demanded of Rian Johnson at the same time. What we get is a full on mad dash for fan acceptance that almost no one is gonna like. The first ten minutes feel like the actors did a bunch of coke and thought that acting meant hurling your lines in choppy disjointed cadences.<br /><br />The heroes skip from one place to another without warning or directly after exposition dumps. You completely understand that this stuff was being made up on the spot as they tumbled down a hill trying to explain plot points the previous movie ruined. The CGI was pedestrian and the characters hollow as the souls of the ideologically possessed creators who allowed Last Jedi to finish any semblance of cohesion the trilogy might have had. I enjoyed Mark Hamill and Adam Driver did his best with what he had. The movie exposes itself in the end with the lead character stealing the very idea and spirit of Star Wars...this isn't Star Wars..this is just a veneer with a name slapped on it just like the final scene in this movie.,0

961,2.0,"So now a Jedi can magically ""Force-Heal"" people, making the deaths of many key characters such as Anakin,Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn and Queen Amidala completely irrelevant. Set decades after the Rebel Alliance won, thereby being 100% responsible for the mess that the galaxy is in, one where the Emperor and Snoke can just magically reappear at any time due to being clones....because reasons, one has to wonder why the rebels even exist any more. Oh, and when did Leia find the time to become a not only a Jedi, but a Master as well? You know what? Don't bother asking too many questions. The timeline and story continuity was broken so many times in episode 8 that the only way they could take it up a notch now was to do exactly what they did - make everything before the sequel trilogy irrelevant. The only consistent character through the entire saga has been C-3PO and Rey's character is just wooden with no nuance at all. At least we still have Mandalorian...for now.",0
962,4.0,Thank god this was the last of the Skywalker saga. The overall quality has been declining steadily since the first one. Don't get me wrong - the visuals have only gotten better with time and this one is absolutely stunning as well. Sadly that is the only positive thing I can say here.,1
963,1.0,"As a fan of movies and specifically the original trilogy, I consider this film a personal insult. JJ Abrams is dead to me.",0
964,4.0,"You'll be disappointed. Very. There was not enough screen time for any of the characters to give you a reason to care about any of them, not even the beloved Luke and Leia.",0

966,1.0,"Not had this feeling for a long time, but I actually wanted to get up and walk out about 45 mins into it. This was just terrible, I'm a massive Star Wars fan but this is worse than the 3 unmentionables (episodes I - III) Will never watch this again. I'll just try and forget it was ever made and just remember the original 3. So sad that the film industry cant make a film anymore :-(",0
967,1.0,"I felt the comedy was lacking in this, the comedy felt rushed and forced, the humour was bland and boring. I like to feel like I'm being a naughty boy when I'm watching a film but this film failed to give me that great mischievous feeling as the Rise of Skywalker was far too suitable for children and too normal a movie. There was also a lack of sexy Female bum cheeks being onscreen in this movie so I found that very upsetting. The characters were simple minded, the dialogue was sometimes repetitive and the dialogue focused far too much on relatively boring things such as basic questions about their own day to day survival that we all go through as Human beings, I don't want to sit through a film about the characters talking about what they're going to have to eat tomorrow!",0
968,9.0,"If you thought the Last Jedi was good, you'll hate this movie. If you love the originals and are willing to try to enjoy this movie, it really is a good final ending to the story. It's a little forced in places because they had to basically undo the last movie and do all the big reveals in this one (like, in the opening crawl) but that's more a failing of The Last Jedi. Don't believe the negative reviews, they would've hated it no matter what. It's fun, has big moments, and it tugs at your heart a time or two.",1
969,4.0,"J.J. with full deliberation, takes Episode 9 and reprises the magic we all were teased & promised from Episode 7.<br /><br />Bringing back characters, closing out lore that felt totally relieving and earned. What a cast, and what an ensemble. The only pitfall was the movie's length. It stretched on a beat too long, but man J.j. went guns abalzing here and it payed off. SW fans can finally sigh in relief and rejoice in a masterful send-off, even if the journey to get there may have led to a bump or two.",1
970,7.0,"Honestly I am in total<br /><br />Shock that there is an actual trend going around where people are bashing this movie, it is actually painful and embarrassing to see.",0
971,,This movie did not feel like a Star Wars film. This and the last Jedi make the prequels look Oscar worthy. It is clear from this movie that the writers have very little knowledge of Star Wars. Palpatine surviving was stupid. I would define it as a rookie mistake. They basically took a crap on the originals. May God have mercy on the souls of the writers and the abomination of the company called Disney.,0

973,2.0,"If the emperor had said that, at least it would make a funny moment in an otherwise miserable, incoherent, messy movie. So many parts of this movie break established norms in Star Wars universe (such as Rey's healing power) that it's almost sacrilegious to call this a Star Wars movie.",0
974,4.0,"I wish I were surprised by this film. But after Episode 7's copy-and-paste plot and TLJ's wanton destructiveness, I honestly can't be. Instead I find myself empty, sad, and anxious to banish the sequel trilogy forever from my memory. Only Episode 6 qualifies as the Skywalker saga's true ending point.",1

978,4.0,"I have to say this. I was 7/8 yo when my grandpa took me to the movies for the first (and only) Star Wars. It blew my mind; I became an instant fan. Forty something years later these guys killed my fantasy with no trace of remorse.<br /><br />Truth be told, decadence began when they tried to revisit the saga. Good ole Hamlet knew something stank in Denmark...<br /><br />Through the too many years and movies, sometimes, very few, they hit bullseye, the majority they just missed the fire.<br /><br />It was like a rollercoaster (but a bad one) that ended up on high budget mediocre movie, poorly acted and worst written. Plot holes everywhere, shallow characters and the most interesting of them all, Kylo Ren, spoiled in less thank five minutes leaving us all with a bitter taste and an illusion of what would have been a great character but killed before becoming god size.<br /><br />Oh love... what a waste. Shame on you G. Lucas!!!",0

983,1.0,"As a movie, this was pretty cool. So if you are NOT invested into Star Wars, and have liked all the Marvel movies, you will really enjoy this. You will appreciate all the wittiness like in Avengers, you will appreciate the emphasis on unity to beat the evil archetype, and all the cute, little, new creatures. BUT, if you are a Star Wars fan, which I identify as, you will not enjoy this movie. Why? This is a Marvel movie. Not a Star Wars movie. The last thing on the creators behind this movie seemed to be to create a Star Wars feel, so that sucks. They didn't add any incredible Star Wars duels, like we saw in Episode 6. Or Jedi fight scenes, which at least the prequels gave us. They didn't have that weird/gross factor which we got from jabba the hut, or the bounty hunter in episode 1. The things that made us love Star Wars are not in this movie. However, they are in The Mandalorian. If you're reading this that probably means you enjoy IMBD, or just want to know the Tea on the latest Star Wars. Either way, go check out The Mandalorian, cause its honestly a better Star Wars production than the last 3 movies combined... It just has that Star Wars feel that you cannot put into words. And this... this does not have it.",1
984,1.0,The Downfall of Star Wars Or FUBAR<br /><br />For me those are the true names of this movie worst movie ever who ever did this should bury his head in sand and hide there the rest of his life,0
985,5.0,Some of the so-called reviewers on here giving it a 10 are just as a joke as the negative ones basically giving no reasons why you like this film and just shaming people who don't agree with you ant aren't giving a rating to more of your liking stop being Disney SW white knight defenders,0
986,1.0,This film sucks. It has the worst writing of all of the Star Wars movies. This movie contains so many problems that I can't break down all of them. It relies on a bunch of coincidences and very convenient circumstances. Also bringing Palpatine back is the worst decision they have made and the reason why he's back is never explained. Over all a god awful end to the Star Wars saga. I do not recommend it.,0
987,10.0,"19 December 2019<br /><br />Film of Choice this very early morning at The Plaza Dorchester - Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. 42 years ago at the age of 9, I remember queuing up the street and round the corner waiting to get into The Plaza Cinema in Dorchester to watch Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Tonight I attended the the same cinema to come full circle as I watched The Rise of Skywalker. Episode IV was groundbreaking back then and films continue to push the boundaries today. This instalment was certainly one of those films. Putting aside the story for a moment what I just watched was a masterclass in CGI. In a world where we have been introduced to many many new species, races, space vehicles, goodies and baddies we were once again embroiled in a Galaxy of destruction and heroism unsurpassed by any other. Returning to the story we are initially drawn through some of the history of how we come to be where we are and then violently propelled at great speed towards the conclusion of this successful franchise. In my humble opinion I think they've done good. Most of the audience seemed glued to their seats and given the early hour of the morning that we were watching it everyone was captivated by what they were watching. Loose ends tied up, glimpses of old friends and enemies and actually, do we really believe that's the last we will see of this family of resistance fighters.......I somehow think not!!!!",1
988,1.0,"I just came out of the special screening that comes as rightful privilege to my office. It is such a terriffic movie. I couldn't have done it better myself. I really loved the sound track of the movie. I think I shall make it the sound of my campaign. I think the most glorious moment was when the horses ran in over that big ship. I will ask whether the space force is going to have horses as well. They really should.<br /><br />Too bad that the old man got impeached by the rebellious democratic forces, so sad. He shouldn't have dissolved the republic and the republican guards, stupid him.<br /><br />Since it is such a grand movie, I am going to give it the first and only place in my heart - one star it is.",1
989,3.0,"Best of the three, but still terrible. Bad and predictable story, bad cast, bad lightsaber fights, horrendous ending. Lots of irrelevant subplots and characters, movie feels like lots of random short clips stuck together. And kylo had the best plot throughout the movie.",0
990,1.0,"I grew up watching Star Wars as a child, the original three, then the prequels that were equally as disappointing. All three sequels to me have felt rushed, no plot, no explanation behind the storyline, no build up, just flat and a disorganized affair. Visually yes, brilliant, unlike the cartoonish prequels. The acting is mediocre and another thing to note is a lack of seriousness at points where in the original films you could almost feel the tension in the room as if you were there in some of the scenes. An admirable attempt to revive the franchise, but such a tall order to live upto and unfortunately they didn't do it for me.",0

I have been a Star Wars fan for over 40 years and this just p*sses on everything George Lucas did right. But make your own mind up... I for one do not count these new three films as canon. Utter trash.",0
995,1.0,"Even the name doesn't suit, you can only see Skywalker for 2 min in this movie and that's also a hologram. People running around pointlessly, characters are bad and acting is dull. Ending of the movie is a big disappointment and story is full of plot holes.",0

998,9.0,"The installment before this final one was pretty boring. Those bonus movies (prequels, side stories, etc.) also underwhelmed me. But this one was SO GOOD. It's Star Wars, you know the story. No recap needed. Just go watch it and be happily surprised that they made the conclusion exciting, funny, and emotionally moving!",1

1000,1.0,"The bad:<br /><br />BIG PICTURE CONCERNS:<br /><br />-The opening crawl is easily the worst-written crawl in all of Star Wars.<br /><br />-How the hell is Palpatine alive? It's not that it's unbelievable, it's that good storytelling would recommend that part of the story be told. And what do you mean the Emperor's son and daughter-in-law are 'nobodies'? This is horrible storytelling.<br /><br />-I did like almost everything else about Rey and Kylo Ren's stories: Rey's power to heal, her lightning power, that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, how Rey and Ben still have the Force connection, that they fall in love. The lightsaber switch at the end when Ben is fighting the Knights of Ren is cool. I liked that Leia gave her life to reach Ben. Ridley and Driver are fantastic in their roles.<br /><br />So why is this negative? Because Palpatine didn't have to be resurrected to make any of this interesting or make it work. He undoes the entire franchise because now Anakin/Darth Vader died in vain - that's what this means.",0

1004,6.0,"I'm sure teens will love it, there are enough battle scenes with lightsabers and ships, the Disney friendship bond and the ""we can do it, together!"" spirit. All very positive, light, predictable and ideal for merchandise sales.<br /><br />It's just that all of the above gets boring and cheesy. If you take out the fight scenes there's not much story left, and the little that is left you will have guessed early on in the film if not in the previous episode. There are no surprises or real plot twist with a bit of darkness for balance. If it was a dish it would be too sweet.<br /><br />It's not terrible and the visuals are good but it's not amazing either.",0
1005,3.0,"Disney screwed everything up, there's no other way of saying this",0
1006,3.0,"I can't believe JJ Abrams directed this (although there was his trademark, requisite lens flare in at least one shot). The movie starts out rushed and chaotic, segues into pointlessness, and completely jumps the shark at the finale. The only redeeming feature of the movie was little Babu Frick (and perhaps the little D-O droid). Worst of all, the movie lacked any sense of that magical Star Wars space drama feel that made the franchise what it is.",0
1007,1.0,"The rise of skywalker is the worst Star Wars movie made yet. This movie lives for trying to pander to every one and force down our throats the contrived fan fiction that is this movie. The pacing is terrible, it tries to please every viewer, has one slightly earned character moment, it's riddled with plots holes, and doesn't know what it wants to do. It is very clear that Disney has given Star Wars the metaphorical shaft in order to only sell a product and merchandise. Please god can Disney stop desecrating star wars for every penny it can get.",0

1010,3.0,"After watching episode's 7,8 and 9, they are all right but just repeating the same idea as episodes 4,5 and 6. Definitely nothing original here. At least episodes 1 to 6 including clone wars have more substance than these rejects.",0
1011,10.0,"The movie is great! The text crawl and the first 5 minutes set up the whole movie with breathtaking speed and with a tiny but interesting twist. Then the movie starts for real, with all the characters coming together (for the first time in the new trilogy). The plot races forward right between (highly positive) fan service and some unexpected surprises. The characters are deeply likable and authentic, an improvement to ""The Last Jedi"", so we get much more involved and emotional during the course of the 141 minutes. Photography, sound, CGI, music are absolutely perfect!<br /><br />Anybody who doesn't like this movie probably doesn't remember the feeling and the awe of seeing the older ones (20 or 42 years ago), they must be really cynical and jaded to dislike it. Do not let them spoil your fun and your enthusiasm.<br /><br />For any die-hard Star Wars fan this movie is a 10.<br /><br />For any casual fan it should be an 8 or 9.<br /><br />And if this is your first Star Wars movie you will probably give it a 7, as it is a decent action movie.<br /><br />Again : for all life-long fans, with all the emotional baggage of 10 movies, countless hours with TV series, books, comics and video games, this is the perfect ending to the Skywalker Saga!",1
1012,7.0,"Fair enough, the latest Star Wars trilogy will not be awarded for it's originality. This movie is no exception. That said, I enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker a lot. Like the Force Awakens it has the feeling of the old Star Wars movies. Something that the Last Jedi had not. JJ Abrahams also stayed true to the legacy or myth of the original characters. Ryan Johnson chose a different path, which divided the fan base. JJ Abrahams returns to, what he started with, the Force Awakens and this movie is more of a sequel to that one as it is to the Last Jedi. In fact, this movie kind of dismisses a lot of the stuff that was told and shown in the Last Jedi.",1
1013,10.0,"The first feeling I've had at the end of the movie, was : ""Thank you"". Thank you J.J. Abrams for everything you've done. Trying hard to give a beautiful conclusion to this Skywalker saga that means so much to so many people ; you included. And it shows.",1

It looked more like a wrap party than a movie, I was never so bored in watching a Star Wars movie. And frankly I'm tired of seeing movies where only a woman can save the world, Hollywood keep force feeding the types of movies on the public, yes we know the importance of female roles in movies and they whine for equality, but every movie produced today force feed us with little girls or adult females out saving mankind or humanity, one reason I stay away from theaters and movies. I'm still trying to figure how when did Captain Marvel have a sex change? Every comic I read growing up Captain Marvel was a man, even had male Captain Marvel action figures, now Marvel is talking about a Female Spider-Girl, thought they had that with the current Spider-Man or Spider-Boy since he plays a 16 year old.

1023,4.0,"Disney haven't completely ruined Star Wars, but nearly. Firstly is is a great thing that Star Wars has lasted this long and characters such C3PO have been played by the same actor in all 9 episodes. Back to the film. Seriously, Disney, with $200M can you not find someone that can write a decent script? This script contains literally a minute of relevant story, the rest of the film is just script for the sake of filling space. And if you look closer you see it's full of flaws and holes. Unbelievably poor. The only bit in the film that was good was the last five seconds of Ben Solo. I know the film is designed for kids but the old Star Wars films still managed to work in a decent story to the film. The producers at Disney should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the Star Wars name and the hard work of the lead actors on such an utterly poor script.",0

It is hard to swallow the rushed, soulless, fan-serviced, reactionary tone of this movie. TLJ might be imperfect, but it definitely had coherence, development, and memorable moments. TFA lacked originality, but was a lot of fun. ROS is none of the above. It is as if a 8 year old mashed together a story from all the new folklore. The visuals are not even that amazing on this one. The fight choreography sucks in this one. This is the worst Star Wars of the new trilogy.",0

Even the people that did see it, they don't see the real image. I think it's amazing how they showed Leia, even for a minute. Han Solo's appearance was totally unexpected. I have read so much bad stuff about Kylo Ren on the internet in the past couple of days, how he's weak etc. After this movie, he's probably my favorite character in this trilogy and one of my favs with Han and Obi-Wan. People expected Anakin to appear and fight Palpetine somehow?? I know you guys love the idea of a ""chosen one"", but we were shown in the movies before that Darth Vader never clones himself. I also loved a correlation in healing by using the Force in The Mandalorian chapter 7 and The Rise of Skywalker. Now I understand why the episode was dropped 2 days early. The ending was awesome, and I get that Rey is too powerful but the movie explains why she is like that. And I think every single one of the last couple of scenes were amazing, like burying lightsabers on Tatooine in presence of Luke and Leia, and Ben Solo (no more Kylo, he's dead) saving Rey's life. And I loved the idea of Hux being a spy since we all knew he hated Kylo (at least the ones who weren't too busy complaining too much about the Last Jedi). Perfect ending if you ask me, not some insane, out of mind theory that would please these whiney little fans. Great job JJ and the crew, I really enjoyed it",1

No Star Wars movie, made after Empire, was better! But that's my humble opinion. Episode III came close, as did Epsiode VII. And here's the thing. We like to compare the movies. And we shouldn't.

While past installments of the Skywalker saga offered detailed themes, thoughtful character moments, and thrilling action; Episode 9 offers a mess of themes that are never fully realized, character moments that are pulled away from so quickly the film doesn't get a chance to breathe, and action sequences that lack the vigor and distinction you expect from a Star Wars film.",0

A misleading step to handle a well-loved franchise by recruiting Jar-jar Abrams, please, someone stop this guy !",0
1057,1.0,This movie was so awful I couldn't stop from laughing. I watched star wars since I was 5 and I am 40.

The fight scenes were very thrilling, the whole movie made me feel like we were back in the old universe again, something I haven't felt with star wars in a very long time. I would definitely suggest to see it. It was well worth it. such great twists and a very satisfying journey.",1
1060,7.0,"No the best, not the worst. A good star wars movie (best of the new trilogy by far).",0
1061,6.0,I feel like if a film is 140 minutes long then it needs to have a lot of depth and layers to it. 'The Dark Knight' for example had about 5 or 6 story lines that all could have justified their own movie. 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' felt like it had one story line that it just expanded out and bloated to the run time it got. I expect more from a 'Star Wars' movie. I feel like I should almost be overwhelmed by the end and need to see it again (and possibly again) to fully appreciate it. That was not the case here.,1
1062,1.0,"I feel like I just watched a montage of a good movie. The whole time the song ""I need a montage"" was playing in my head.<br /><br />Frustrating because I didn't have an issue with the story itself. But it had zero heart. I thought SW was about relationship, people, love, hero's journey, but there was not one grounding emotional moment in TROS. Not one real conversation between anyone.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />Geez even when Ben dies, there was no sadness felt or seen. Shouldn't Rey be sad that she just found and immediately lost him? It didn't even give me time to mourn the loss. And I'm a super Kylo/Ben fan! Urgh so frustrating. But that is the tone of the whole movie. No time for feelings. Ironic since Fin talks about ""feelings"" guiding him multiple times.<br /><br />We know from TLJ Rey n Ben have a mesmerizing chemistry but none of that came through here. No fault of the actors but the direction just didn't give them time.<br /><br />I give it 6 because i can't hate it because I still love the characters. But I hated this movie as a movie.

I stood in line in 1977 with a group from the Physics department of Washington University because they said it should be great and it was. In retrospect it was not the history of the Roman empire but a fantasy in space. Yet, I continually see comments that this was a disappointment and I ask myself how so. It I science fiction a creation of the mind of humans who spent hours toiling to create the scenarios and yet you in your wisdom, and lack of creative thought , just can not enjoy it for what it is. Tonight it was on TnT and even with the advertisements for nothing I will ever use I enjoyed it and found a product that tied up the loose ends. If you did not like it you did pay to see it and thus supported the presentation therefore who is the fool the creators for presenting you a well thought out story or you making an attempt to comment well out of your training as a critic. I have over the years watched all of them and some were better than others but all entertaining. This movie is not a 10 as none of them are but enjoyable. Oh, BTW those were not horses as someone commented I have no idea what they were but if you think they were horses I have a bridge for sale in Brooklyn ;) I suspect most of those who complain required remedial viewings to catch up on the story line as you did not exist in 77.

1077,2.0,"Here we have a film I would place 7th in a 9 film race, with only the first two prequels below it. While not an excessive anticlimax, nothing felt up to par with what Abrams should have been able to pull of. Even if you excuse the damage repair from episode 8, this thing is very flawed and while it should feel like an event, it just feels like any other film, comparable to Godzilla: King if the Monsters in more ways than one. It's absolutely littered with clichés, including but not limited to: 'finding yourself', huge character change of heart for story purposes, overcoming a seemingly indestructible villain with simple means, conveniently placed item that is important to the plot that is just there because you couldn't get it before, and possibly the biggest deus ex machina I've ever witnessed. The ending is also really depressing for Rey because of a thing that happens that doesn't get explained and thus makes no sense. And the action sequences are rather bland. Even episode 8 added something interesting to the fights and did a half decent job with them. This film went to the Marvel school of one side or the other always having the upper hand. I really didn't get much out of this it was just 'oh yeah, that happened and now the trilogy has ended. I barely care at all.' Maybe worth a watch just to wrap everything up, but seriously this is not a strong end.",0
1078,3.0,"The Skywalker saga isn't special anymore. The original trilogy is arguably the most influential series of films in the science fiction fantasy genre. The prequel trilogy, as hated and flawed as they are, show a new era of this world and believably build to the original trilogy in a satisfying way. The first six episodes were someone's vision and filled with imagination. This trilogy is capitalizing on what you love and doesn't dare do anything new unless it's a subversion of expectations that purely exist for a cheap shock factor. This does not feel like a Star Wars movie, it feels like a young fan's wishlist and theories stretched for two hours and twenty movies. Disney has proven they can tell smaller but well done Star Wars stories with Rogue One and The Mandalorian, but they have no idea how to tell the Skywalker saga. This movie is bantha poodoo. The episodic saga ended in 2005 with Revenge of the Sith. This movie doesn't ruin the whole saga, it just ruins this trilogy. If you love Star Wars, don't waste your time or money on this one.",0
1079,9.0,"Like Force Awakens, this is pure pulp trash, with flashy camerawork, flashy special effects, 4th wall breaking humour and lashings of fan service. Silly and contrived plot, odd moments when the writers troll us with apparent character demise, only to undo it moments later. And, yet again, the most hilarious disregard for the laws of physics. But it was ever thus. The entire franchise is ridiculous from start to finish. Not a bit of it makes any logical sense whatsoever. Even the original trilogy's story arc felt like that game where you write part of a story on a piece of paper, fold it over and hand it to the next person. The prequel trilogy less so... but that's levels of awfulness below everything else, so hardly a redeeming feature. Shame Rose was relegated to a side character though... I think that's the only disappointing bit of the movie. Otherwise, a great send off. Now let's hope someone goes back and re-makes the prequels. And maybe the original trilo- oops... too far?",0
1080,3.0,"I saw the movie today, and I have to say, I struggled through most of it. It was a complete mess from start to finish with terrible writing, plot twists, too much dialogue and jumping from place a to place b. Just too much crammed up into one movie.",0

Rian Johnson has managed to kill the whole Star Wars franchise in one take making The last Jedi that nothing makes sense anymore.<br /><br />A glimpse of romance that is forgotten after less then 5 minutes. Ray has a status of a Goddess, bringing people back to life and destroying imperial Star Crusers with the force!<br /><br />Ray should be the emperor of the universe ""far far away"".<br /><br />Ray Skywalker, I don't think so.",0

The gang go on a galaxy wide fetch quest, meet the emperor give some inspiring speeches and save the day (also the resistance suddenly has more than 10 members again). The Rey-Ren dynamic is still interesting and of course there's some fun parts but ultimately I found it all quite silly and even boring towards the end.",0

While it is a well made movie and all the actors (especially Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, and Ian Mcdiarmid) try their best with what they are given, everything else is an insult. The writing is bogged down by fan service, video game side quests, retreading of the other movies, and trying to undo what the last Jedi did even though that was a way better movie because it at least focused on telling its own story not just trying to please everyone. On top of that, the score is pretty much the same themes we heard over again, the emperors inclusion in general is confusing and unnecessary, Kylo goes back to square one as a wannabe Vader rip off, the visuals while well done are not creative, and the ending is just one big middle finger to the fans by just giving them a unsatisfactory ending. I will defend aspects of force awakens and last Jedi, but this one I can't defend anything in this film.",0

The movie barely has any continuity with the previous two (also bad, but not nearly as bad) movies. The plot is rushed, feels forced and is mostly held together by constant Deus Ex Machina moments. It's just awful. Star Wars is genuinely hard to mess up - everybody knows that it's a space fairy tale - but Disney managed to do it. If there ever was a philanthropic cause to champion then it'd be for someone to buy the franchise from Disney",0

I am glad I did because Rise offers many moments of nostalgia and tries its best to close out 42 years of story telling. Did it accomplish this mighty task?

I am not swayed by the nostalgic insertions of cameo appearances (I did appreciate legendary John Williams and out of costume Anthony Daniels cameos though). I will not tell people to make up their own mind and watch it because that coats the money pockets of bad writers and is an enabling device to develop more trash with attendance numbers. At this point, almost everyone goes in because they hope for a resolution or because it is Star Wars. Soon you will see the folly of that attitude. Someone else bought my ticket, I have not watched in theater a Star Wars movie since The Force Awakens left me very disgruntled.",0

C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, Leia, Lando...They are there, showing the band can play one last song before that long pause after a tour (we know, for Leia, is the last one, unfortunately). They did such an amazing job using Carrie's footage and honoring her memory. I feel this movie will mark a generation forever, as it did mine, years ago.<br /><br />Haters are gonna hate. Back in my days, I didn't have the internet to write such an elaborate review and make it seen by thousands of people. If I could, I would've exalted ROTJ. A perfect ending for a perfect trilogy.

I didn't see anything really wrong with how things were handled, except for anything involving Leia. That was painfully bad.

The results have shown. They only thing that can save this franchise is time- probably another thirty years. Don't see this movie. The prometheans who made this film stole the fire from the gods and squandered it. Go watch a movie that was made with love.,0
1126,7.0,"It was entertaining enough and I liked that everything ended on mostly a happy note but it all felt very rushed.

1139,8.0,"I saw ""Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker"", starring Daisy Ridley-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Scrawl; Adam Driver-The Dead Don't Die, Logan Lucky; Keri Russell-The Americans_tv, Mission:Impossible 3 and Ian McDiarmid-The Lost City of Z, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.<br /><br />This is the 9th and final chapter in the Skywalker saga-don't worry, there will be more Star Wars movies, just not about the Skywalkers. Daisy returns as Rey, the Jedi uncertain of her past or future and her family tree is finally revealed-and it is not what you might think. Adam returns as Kylo Ren, always trying to turn Daisy to the dark side. Keri is a new character that helps Daisy and friends on their search for answers and Ian returns as Palpatine-didn't he die before? Well, everything is explained on that front. There are several older characters that pop up and one of them is Carrie Fisher-it's been widely known that she is in this film so I am not spoiling anything here. Since she died shortly after completion of the last movie, the footage of Carrie is not CGI, but unused footage from episodes 7 & 8-The Force Awakens & The Last Jedi, respectively. The music is still by John Williams, it's directed by J.J. Abrams and there are some major character deaths-not just Stormtroopers but big name characters. As far as the plot goes, Ian is trying to relaunch the First Order and become the Emperor of the Universe and Daisy and crew are trying to stop him. There isn't any scenes after the end credits. Although it does get a little slow and repetitive at times, it does wrap up things nicely.<br /><br />It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence and action & has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",1
1140,4.0,If only JJ Abrams had Luke Skywalker to lift this drowning franchise out of the drink. The sunken imagery that this movie has in abundance is an apt description of where it's all going. The whole thing plays like The Goonies in space and the treasure hunt gimmick of the dagger that shows them where to search is so tired and stupid that it just beggars belief. Who would come up with such a thing? It just further underscores how JJ mindlessly imitates the better stories that have come before him. (To be fair treasure maps are in themselves a stupid idea - who would make a map showing others how to steal their money?) The final insult comes as the long-awaited identity of Rey is discovered and then denied as she decides to take on the name of her mentor. If Return of the Jedi ended that way it would go something like this:,0

I hated the first half, but was pulled in somewhat in the second part, mainly because Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is kind of intriguing, at least compared to the rest of the cast. When he's around, the film almost seems like it might become proper star wars, and that despite the fact that for part of it he ponces around in the silliest Sith suit you could imagine. Whoever thought that red streaked helmet looked cool should be summarily fired from their job.",0

It was incredible to see Leia and it was as if she was there on set it was beautifully done and a great send off and her Death had real meaning , Billy Dee Williams was excellent as Lando it was like a duck to water he just knows how to play him so brilliantly , Mark Hamill was also excellent and used so very well in the movie - he finally lifted his x-wing out of the water ! The Rise of Skywalker was the most ambitious and epic Star Wars movie that had so much to tell in a short time and it was pulled off beautifully and was a very fitting end to the Skywalker Saga ! hats off to everyone involved .",1

1148,4.0,Aside from the billions this new trilogy made was was the actual point of this trilogy?,0
1149,1.0,"A poor edited and inconsistent story that is a depressing end to the story. The movie creates inconsistency to the story the first two films awesomely created. The editing was awful. There are times when you can see a character's mouth moving but no words come out like they cut the dialogue or cut scenes together. There are times hand placement is off and hair length or style off. A lot of this made the rumors of the script and story constantly changing while filming look true as does the rumors of the release of the Visual Guide Book and Kylo Ren comic being pushed back because they chopped the story together and changed it at the last minute. It's like they chickened out, listened to outside interference and changed the trilogy outline. The final film had a lot of plot holes, inconsistent story and horrible dialogue. The message of the force is for everyone was kicked out the window and Rey having to be from a bloodline was created instead of her being just Rey was enough. While the characters of Finn and Poe got more screen time in this one it just lacked character growth and purpose. Finn, Poe and Rey had more scenes together then in the previous movie but the connections were off. They lacked chemistry and emotion. They didn't feel like a found family or even ""the trio"". Finn really lacked a character arch other than action and yelling another character's name. The Finn and Poe connection was off. It's like the connection was off so they wouldn't have to address the chemistry fans saw and to appease viewers or critics they had two background same sex characters embrace. Chewie with the medal should have been a great moment but unlike the dice scene in previous films lacked the symbolism and felt like a cheap nod. The saving aspects of the film are the action and Adam Driver's performance. He might not have any lines in second half of the film but he is a very expressive without words. The conflict and turmoil his character goes through is beautifully played. He continues what the force awakens and Last Jedi started which is: a man struggling with the abuse and manipulation he suffered in childhood that caused him to turn dark but the light in him won't die. The most emotionally satisfying scene is between Han and Ben and it's wonderfully played by Driver and Harrison Ford. Driver is impressive as Kylo Ren but he is even better as Ben Solo. The few minutes we get to see him as Ben Solo is everything you would want and expect from an offspring of Han and Leia or a ""Solo"" movie. The other bright spot and one consistent thing in the trilogy is the magic of Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley onscreen together and connection and balance of their characters together. Kylo/Ben and Rey are truly stronger and better when together. The true balance of the force and there is a balance between the light and dark. Their fight scenes were like a dance. Rey as the aggressor doing the attacking and Kylo/Ben dodging and defending. Their teaming up is something the movie needed more of. Other than that the movie was messy. It lacked creativity, and hope. The ending was depressing. Three generations of Skywalker men neglected, given up on, manipulated and abused to eventually turn those things around only to have the entire family wiped out. It's like the sacrifice Han and Leia made was for nothing. The ending lacked balance. I thought these trilogy would not end like original that it would be its own ending with balance in the force and actual growth but it didn't. But unlike original trilogy this one felt empty and was not hopeful. It was unsatisfying and depressing. The end of the trilogy deserved better and more maybe there should have been a fourth to fix this or give more time to tell the story because this ending was unsatisfying I'm still waiting for someone to yell April fools or tell me I got punked.",0

The Adventure is pretty pleasant to see and the end let us think that it will have a next episode. But i dont know.

1166,1.0,"This movie is the best example of how not to write a good story. I don't even know where to start, there is so many problems with this movie that it could have been written by a child. I remember when I read the leaks of this film and couldn't believe it because of how ridiculous it sounds and then it was what we really got as the film.<br /><br />So now Palpatine is back and they don't explain how, Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, Kylo Ren is the leader of the first order and he met Palpatine who tells him he will give him an army if he kills Rey. After that there is some pointless discussion, some incoherent action, some fight between Rey and Kilo. At some point Rey heal Kilo from a wound and Han come out of nowhere to talk to his son and turn him back to the light. Is he a force ghost? It doesn't appear like it. His he just a vision in Kylo head. We don't know either since :"" Rise of the skywalker it doesn't explain anything."" Yeah, that's an actual quote from Kathleen Kennedy. She probably didn't mean that but that's the story of the entire movie.<br /><br />What happen next? Rey and the rebels or resistance are going to confront Palpatine who now ask Rey to be her successor. So if it was his plan, why did he just ask Kylo to bring her with him? So after Rey turns him down, Kylo appear to help Rey and now Palpatine suck some life force from them.<br /><br />And finally Rey uses her lightsaber to deflect Palpatine force lightning to kill him. Ok so being thrown in the reactor of the death star and with the death star explosion was not enough to kill Palpatine for good, but his own lightning was? This is laughable. Now I can say that with all the flaws in the EU, it was a lot better than the stupid trilogy we've got.<br /><br />I can't believe some people think that this trilogy is good, it's worst then the prequel. I was a huge Star Wars fan but now I just don't care anymore. They make the movie way too fast, they didn't take the time to write a complete interesting and coherent story and it was a terrible idea to ask different director for each movie.<br /><br />Anyways I don't think I will waste anymore of my time complaining about this movie because this trilogy doesn't deserve to waist anybody's time.",0

1199,8.0,"This was a wonderful movie that I really enjoyed it. For me its a solid 8. Its the first star wars movie I have seen that has managed to capture to some extent for me the spirit and magic of the original star wars trilogy. Rogue One a few years ago managed it but it was too dark to leave the theatre feeling uplifted. I am old enough to remember seeing in the theatres the original star wars trilogy. All the actors crew and filmmakers associated with this move have done a great job. I like the Disney Trilogy more than the prequels. I never really liked the prequels except for Natalie portman who was terrific and the cameo by Christopher Lee. But Disney have managed to bring back some of the magic of the original. Although the Original will always be the best. This band of Rey, Finn, Po, C3PO and Chewie were terrific as were the cameos by the aging stars of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fischer (R.I.P. Carrie Fisher who sadly passed away during filming of this movie). I hope this is not the last we see of Daisy Ridley she is a terrific actress , Adam Driver was terrific as the villain in this latest instalment of star wars who eventually turns to the good side and redeems himself, as is Oscar Isaac all talented actors who made this trilogy so good. Last Jedi was a real low point,though even that had its plus points like Mark Hamill and some fine set design and special effects, but this movie has redeemed for what went wrong in Last Jedi. The movies I would rate in order as follows.<br /><br />Number one is Empire Strikes Back (1980), Star Wars (1977), Return of the Jedi (1983), The Rise of Skywalker (2019), Rogue One (2016), The Force Awakens (2015), Revenge of the Sith (2005), Attack of the Clones (2002), The Last Jedi (2017).

The Last Jedi was slow, confusing, annoying (Rose and the casino planet alone take the cake here) and it made me doubt the entire state of the franchise. Watching this film was like a breath of fresh air. JJ Abrams is a wildly talented director, there were moments where he was able to tell more in 5 minutes of screen time than entire plot line's from The Last Jedi. It's a beautiful example of efficient and clean story telling. It's as if JJ is that one team member who carries the group for the entire first assignment, goes on holiday, his team mate proceeds to ruin everything, and he has to step-in and do what no one else can to fix the mistake. This movie isn't perfect but considering what he had to work with it's an absolute masterpiece of creative film making. I highly recommend seeing it, if only to appreciate JJ's skills.",0

The movie wants to clean the mess created by the previous films in the sequel trilogy but it actually creates it's own mess. They showed snoke as the ultimate villain of the trilogy but then they decided to bring back palpatine. This movie has no connection to the previous films. I am not a fan of Episode 7 and Episode 8 but the final installment actually starts telling a new story and concludes that instead. There is no story arc for the characters except Kylo Ren. The movie tried to give us some fan service but it fails to do that too. As you know the previous films were lacking on fan service and this movie was like ""You asked for fan service? Here is fan service!"" and just slaps us with nostalgia and fan service in every scene possible. When something shocking happens in the screen it just jumps over to another shocking thing. It doesn't let us feel the emotions. The ending of the movie doesn't only ruin the movie itself but it also ruins the previous movies by destroying Anakin Skywalker's story arc.

What i did find surprising is that last movie (this one) got all the lowest scores while the other two parts from the trilogy got mixed reviews. I truly think this last movie (from the 3rd trilogy) is kinda good, maybe due to the fact that the script (although not perfect, it has inconsistencies now.and then, like the story misses some parts - i.e. the falcon rough landing due to unknown cause) was better (my personal opinion is that Hollywood doesnt have skilled writers anymore nor talented actors) and also due to the fact that lead actors got older or more mature, this shows.

1254,5.0,"Director Abrams' closing chapter in the star wars saga gives a rousing send off to all characters involved, but unfortunately, this is a key stone cops style caper bumped up to A grade hollywood blockbuster polish. Some of the early scenes show great visual flair, and Abrams sure knows his way around large scale action sequences. But boredom soon start to creep in as all the action sequences look more or less the same. No degree of FX or production value can mask the wafer thin plot, which involves our heroes zooming around looking for one thingamajig after another. Star Wars mythology such as the return of the Sith lord Palpatine seem to be dropped into the story at random; there isn't a cohesive attempt at enhancing the star wars world building. We suddenly find out Palpatine is alive, there is a huge invasion under way, and if you've seen episodes 4 and 7, this is basically the same plot threads recycled, with the FX and action upgraded. Old characters mysteriously just show up for fan service for a scene or two. Everyone hugs at the end. Other than Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) , none of the other characters get much characterization beyond basic character beats (meaning - they all act teary, earnest and determined all the time). The Sith planet should have a certain terror to it, but it is just another impressive visual backdrop that seems less than integral to the world building. Technology of the universe seems selected at random and there is no effort to build up some logic (every bit of data transfer appears to need a serial port, guess they didn't invent WiFi , eh). However, ships can go at lightspeed and suddenly, every other destroyer has death star capabilities. Even with such supposedly terrifying weaponry, people just go around on horses blowing them up. In one cool but ludicrous scene, a ship just goes to light speed at random and pops up in the middle of all manner of floating space debris, planetary obstacles, and right in front of the gaping maw of a giant worm thing. It's almost like Abrams went ""logic be damned, I just want to make it look cool"". Kylo Ren is sometimes the villain, and other times a hero. The whole movie just seems arbitrary and made up by a panel of Disney marketeers. At least, the non human characters all do better than their human counterparts - it was fun to see C3PO and Chewie have their fair share of screen time.<br /><br />The same action scenes from ep IV are all regurgitated, like Abrams had a fan check list. So expect planet hopping, return to tattooine, rescuing someone from a battleship, and so on. And one really wonders how the empire became such a superpower when the rebels have so many friends that can just appear in a minutes notice with enough firepower to destroy a large invasion ready battle fleet? I thought the Empire was crushed at the end of ep 6? Why are the rebels still rebels after 20 years. It would have been better if, say, the rebels had reformed the republic, but it was subverted from within by the first order. That probably would have made a better movie, but I guess Disney wasn't too interested in risking a new direction in the narrative.<br /><br />As for a star wars universe point of view, there are so many important points that don't make sense. Aren't the Sith supposed to work in pairs? Who was Snoke? Was Kylo Ren a sith? Who turned him to the dark side? All of that just goes out the window, this trilogy doesn't stay true to the internal logic of the star wars universe. There is no build up to who the villains are, what their motivations are, everything is just kind of fuzzy - like a cartoon facsimile of the story we all know and grew up with.<br /><br />I would say this is a terrible star wars movie which does nothing to continue the narrative of the saga but rather more intent on milking the first trilogy for all it's commercial potential - nostalgia is the overriding objective here, not storytelling. George Lucas, for all his perceived faults, at least wanted very clearly to tell distinctly separate stories. Eps 4-6 was a kind of western, while Eps 1-3, was a Greek tragedy in space. Sadly, Eps 7-9 is the glossy update of episode 4 (yes, it just concentrates on repeating a single episode) without any continuance of the saga, without any real character to the stories. Yes, they should have called it star wars episode 4.1.<br /><br />In short, very disappointed. For the record, to me ep 3 Revenge of the Sith was the best ever SW movie.<br /><br />Thanks Disney for spoiling the franchise. Great work. I'm giving this 5/10 stars due to the impressive FX work and production values. But this is a very disappointing end to the whole star wars saga. Please get George Lucas back on board if you want to make any more movies in the series.",0

The Rise of Skywalker is not just another cashgrabber (although it surely will win the box office over) but it also is an ending to the biggest and one of the greatest sagas of all time; it concludes all of the plotlines, connects all of the puzzle pieces together into one big picture and answers all of the questions you had before. Wonderful score by maestro John Williams, outstanding direction by J.J. Abrams, masterful visuals and a superb cast, especially Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley who have been leading this new trilogy and have brought the saga to the perfect end.

I applaud their (Disney and Abrams) attempt at Star Wars. I think they would have been great at creating a new trilogy within the universe but in a different storyline. Their attempt at the Skywalker saga feels rushed and small in scale and ambition.<br /><br />We know from interviews that Ian McDiarmid was contacted after the release of the Last Jedi. This would indicate that bringing him back as Palpatine was a measure of correcting or changing the direction. I would have hoped that the trilogy was laid out before shooting of the force awakens began. But the fact that Ian came on (and according to himself was surprised) so late, helps paint a picture of the movies being made ""one the go"".<br /><br />The act of killing off Snoke was bad, but bringing back Palpatine was, perhaps, even worse. The Rise of Skywalker feels like the rollercoaster ride that was the last jedi, was in vain. Having Palpatine back suddenly shifts the entire trilogy to be about him and then also changes the entire saga to center around Palpatine. This is in many ways his saga - not Skywalker's. That he, all along from The Phantom Menace to his obliteration in The Rise of Skywalker was the one pulling all the strings.<br /><br />I think most fans would have settled for a Snoke that was a clone of a sith lord or even an unknown son of Palpatine. It is very much the fault of the last jedi that the rise of Skywalker struggles, but it is ultimately the premise and the incoherent storyline of the entire trilogy that fails the fans.",0
1267,2.0,The first Starwars were extraordinary and you felt great after watching them.,1
1268,4.0,"I have never been as disappointed by StarWars like this time. The movie is very very Cheesy, we lost the nice goosebumps we used to have while seeing Nostalgic scenes or characters. This time it went out of hand, they were using Jokes in a very dumb way. I wish i can just erase my memory and just have the good old Star wars good memories. Disaster",0
1269,1.0,"Force awakens, destroyed the new republic without us seeing the achievements of the original trilogy characters, but at least added some new interesting ideas, like a rouge storm trooper. Last jedi ruined hopes of seeing luke training a new generation of jedi, but at least we got a newer movies looking at the past failures of the jedi and a new more gray/nuanced villlain take control in the end. So my thoughts going into the last movie were, Finn a rouge storm trooper would lead a rebelion of storm troopers after just deciding he was commited to the cause in the last jedi. And we would see a new way to look at the force and the jedi order where they could be built with balance. We got none of that. We got terribly paced trash, just rehashing everything starwars has ever done but without the charm and done worse and with the fast forward button down. At this point i look at the skywalker saga as 6 movies. At least if thats the end, the palpatine is dead. At this point we don't know, because at this point can you even kill anyone in starwars, is anyone ever dead?.",0
1270,1.0,"Carrie Fisher did not have to sit through this; that's about the only good thing about this movie. This movie is devoid of talent like the space is devoid of life.

1271,3.0,"If I had never seen any previous star wars movies I would give it a 6. As someone who has seen them, I give it a 3/10. Still, I can say with confidence that This is the worst star wars movie ever made. I saw this movie in theater, and had to sit through all 3 terrible hours. I later heard that the director of this movie hated the director of the previous movie, so that's just one of the reasons it's going bad. This newest trilogy was very bad. Force awakens was decent, this movie is unbearable.",0
1272,1.0,Please read this honest review if you're about to watch the movie. Ive been a star wars fan for 13 years and I will give my honest opinion of this movie and the previous 2 movies. The movie quality is good however it did not introduce anything new. In general the movie is a copy of the previous trilogy. Kathleen stated that they wanted to make a new movie without making it the same over but somehow they still did.<br /><br />How is the movie the same?<br /><br />1. Rey as female Luke<br /><br />2. First Order the same as the Empire such as stormtroopers<br /><br />3. Snoke and Kylo literally the Emperor and Vader<br /><br />4. The new crew with Finn is literally Han Solos crew,1
1273,8.0,"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is a very satisfying conclusion to the final trilogy of the Skywalker Saga. Every character received the conclusion they deserved and every member of the cast delivered a fantastic performance. The movie's cinematography and camerawork is beautiful, as is the case in every Star Wars movie. However, the one negative I have is the use of Emperor Palpatine in this movie. After his death, which was the best part of Return Of The Jedi, he should have stayed dead and using him again as the main antagonist for this movie takes away from the power of that scene and the redemption of Darth Vader. However, the rest of the movie is very good, with a strong message, several nostalgic moments which will please several fans and a solid finale to the Skywalker Saga. I highly recommend this movie.",1
1274,7.0,"I think a lot of reviewers have been unfairly harsh towards this movie. The movie does its best to bring back old favourites and knit them back with the new characters into a believable ending for the series. It achieves this and still throws up an entertaining story with tons of action and light sabres. Star Wars was always a Space Opera - not a Woody Allen film, so get over it !",1

What little story there was, was contrived and made no sense. It did not fit in with the eight chapters that came before it.<br /><br />Great science fiction, like Star Wars, is created and developed with a specific paradigm in mind. For Star Wars it is all based on a balance of good and evil. If one side is in charge, everything is chaos. Abrams ignored the previous story lines, the need for balance, and obviously doesn't understand basic human emotion. If the movie had been chaotic, it would have been more interesting.",0
1278,10.0,"Ignore the negative reviews this film is amazing, my kids all wanna see it again they thought it was fantastic, loads of nostalgia for me and plenty of action and excitement for them, won't spoil anything but there's a bit in the final battle that trumps the end game finale for me.

1280,2.0,"Another train-wreck from start to finish. And not a particularly entertaining one either. It's more frustrating even because they ocasionally had the chance to do something interesting, but they don't have the guts to pull through. The concept of ""The Force"" has been so altered, butchered and modified to fit a ludicrous plot that it feels we're watching Dragon Ball's Dendé use his magic power. The force was supposed to be a subtle but powerful ally, now it can teleport physical objects across the galaxy, heal a light saber to the chest or bring entire fleets down (unless you cross two light sabers crossed in front of you, that's another story). Rey's as all-powerful as ever, which makes her the least interesting character in the whole 9 movies saga. Kathleen Kennedy's hand is all over the place, only female characters in the lead, except Poe (that has a crisis because he can't do what Leia did before him). But hey, at least is consistent with the rest of the saga. We should bury THIS movie in Tatooine instead of the light sabers.",0

1283,5.0,"The Rise of Skywalker has its moments but suffers from sloppy dialogue, overblown story and predictable plot points. The characters are quite bland and uninteresting and it really shows during pivotal scenes, with use of extremely basic expressions and empty deliveries. There is very little chemistry between the main trio of the film, it is not believable that they appear to have such a strong bond with each other, it feels very forced. We are supposed to be taking a dreaded and epic voyage with these characters but the scale isn't quite there and the audience can't get immersed. The sense of danger or threat is nowhere to be found even when characters are in extreme situations or death in the face. There is little to no use of mystery or imagination that some of the most visually stunning locations become very boring rather quickly. There is virtually no substance so we are left with almost no relative connection to things that are happening. Time flashes by so fast that in many scenes we are devoid of the emotional depth or connection we need to be able to feel anything. There are plenty of times where I thought I'd like to see more of this or that explored, but it's as if there was no time to waste and the movie had to move on. It was like being a child walking around a huge toy shop for the first time only to be pulled along by a frustrated parent.",0

1285,9.0,"I had many trepidation's about this film, especially after the mess created by Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams had so many things to try and rectify after episode 8: a film which basically threw out all the story and character groundwork that had been laid in the Force Awakens. On top of that, he also had to find a resolution for the loss of Carrie Fisher - no small task there either.<br /><br />For me at least, not only was he able to that (by degree) but he was also able to construct a storyline that gave the main protagonists momentum. We all know how dearly this franchise is held by so many people. It would be impossible to satisfy everyone. This does not deserve the 1/10 ratings that many are venting about here.<br /><br />This has the best performances of this trilogy. The characters who we are supposed to care about have clearer arcs, and those newer characters introduced by Rian Johnson have been rightly relegated to supporting roles (eg Rose). Mind you, there weren't many left after the Last Jedi either.<br /><br />I don't understand why people are so hung up about the Skywalker linage issues or that this entry tramples the trope about Anakin being the one to bring balance to the force. His story finished with Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />I for one have really enjoyed watching Rey's arc throughout this series. Her rapidly developing powers have been quite awesome to see. And now we know why. I can't help but feel there's a bit of misogyny sprinkled about here.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how successful this film was in addressing the many issues presented by its predecessor. Yes, the pacing could of been better in parts but JJ had a lot to do in 2 and half hours. I do wonder what would of been different if Carrie Fisher was still alive for instance.<br /><br />All that said, this is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. And one which fixes so many of the problems introduced earlier while also trying to placate all the stakeholders who are so heavily invested in this franchise. Us included.",1

1287,1.0,"From start to finish, I couldn't get into this movie. There was nothing done with enough cinematic excellence, hell even basic cinematic competence, for me to latch on to, in order to actually care about the characters or the very convoluted plot. Right from the beginning, you're zooming past one scene and straight into another, with almost back-to-back action scenes for minutes at a time. And when there isn't an action scene zooming past, there's very fast-paced dialogue that doesn't let you sit and digest the information presented.",0

If you truly care about the story and the lore/mythology of Star Wars, stay FAR away from this movie. Director J.J Abrams and 'writer' Chris Terrio just looked at the Reddit page for the Star Wars movies and took fan theories en fanfiction and decided that should be the story. Absolute mess of a 'movie' and this will go down as the number 1 example of how to NOT make movies. They check stuff off a list and insult your intelligence while rushing through the movie. Nothing sticks, nothing makes sense. Its also boring as hell. Even the lightsaber fights are incredibly boring.",0

It hurried along at a breakneck pace and yet a lot of it was filler. It's just a bad movie, and that makes me kind of sad.",0
1293,5.0,"Emperor Palpatine back from the dead, seriously?! If anyone was supposed to be that powerful, it was supposed to be Luke Skywalker, not the Emperor. The entire story has been out of balance since his death because there is no Skywalker to take down the empire (unless they decided to make Ray a Skywalker, but they made her a Palpatine). And just when you think they might correct the imbalance, Ben suddenly converts back following him mom's death. They had an opportunity to fix everything by making him a Jedi and having Ray embrace her bloodline, then have a true Skywalker take down the new Sith Lord, but instead they had a Palpatine take down the Empire, which goes against everything the entire franchise has been preaching from day 1. And then, to correct it, they simply make her choose to change her name at the end, omg, horrible writing. I'll take half of what these idiots are making and write a story 1000 X's better than this.",0
1294,1.0,"The heart of the SW movies is the story and the character development. Here, the story is a mess. Illogical, no creativity, reusing the same scenes and cliches from the original trilogy, the main hero has super powers like in some Marvel movie, there was no great evil left after episode 8, so they had to bring back a character that was already dead... But that creates major plot holes. The other characters are bland and boring. I believe that the director doesn't understand the Star Wars Universe. The only thing that were good are the visuals. But that's all. As a long time Star Wars fan, my request is to remove this sequel trilogy from canon, and hire a director who understands the franchise and has talent and creativity to make new, memorable and enjoyable stories that are worth watching.",0

1297,2.0,"This movie is a ton of fun to watch, and the big moments, twists, and action scenes will put a smile on any star wars fan. None the less, the more one sits back and thinks about the plot, the more one realizes how many stretches and holes there are. This is due I think to how much JJ Abrams tried to pack into this movie to the point where it got a little sloppy. This is because JJ basically had only two movies to accomplish his story and vision as opposed to a whole trilogy due to how little TLJ did to advance the overall trilogy. The fast pace will allow for one to not notice these holes the first viewing but the more you watch it the more you notice. Also the movie definitely wants an ""Endgame"" moment of great grandiose and emotional payoff, however the trilogy feels so disjointed that we never get invested enough in these characters for them to earn the emotional payoff at the end. However, the fast-pace, twists, and great star wars moments make for a very fun viewing despite its flaws.",1

Wish it wasn't so, but here we are. Regarding this particular movie it's really really bad. I see how it tries to fix everything The Last Jedi broke, but it fails miserably. There actually is no point in discussing this, or the two other movies. Just realize that there's no coherent story, no internal logic and one-dimensional characters in all leading roles. On the plus side is Adam Driver who actually did a decent job portraying the conflicted nature of Kylo Ren. Anyway, in the end Disney managed to make not one, not two, but three absolutely horrific movies from the greatest movie franchise ever. Well done, I guess.

Abrams trying to mend the broken The Last Jedi left for us, thank you very much sir, but The Rise of Skywalker seem to prove that fixing the franchise with only just one movie is proven to be more destructive than constructive. Following the will of the fanbase is the secret recipe of success, only when it was done from the beginning. Now instead, what we got is one big of a convoluted mess, with little to no good result of the character development aspect that has been built up since Force Awakens, some parts just don't make any sense, too much going on that no time for us to realize what is going on, too many inconsistencies, and all other stupid things happening that I personally can summarize in few words: It doesn't feel like Star Wars at all. No matter how many TIE Fighters, X-Wing, Star Destroyers, and planet-decimating superweapons you put in front of the camera, no matter how many times you see the Millenium Falcon flees the bad guys in one sitting, it is not Star Wars when you are forced to see a 2-3 movies cramped into one two-and-a-half-something-hour movie, it's something else, and it's not good, let alone remarkable.",0

But the worst moment in this movie is when rey and Kylo Ren kissed, that made me so mad to the part where I actually paused the movie, and started playing candy crush, but after 40 minutes, I finally said to myself, ""the sooner I get through this irritation of a film, the sooner I can do something with my life again"" and then Kylo Ren dies, so this movie made me waste 40 minutes of my time, and then rey got a gold lightsaber somehow, then someone asks her who she is, and they attempt a emotional moment and fail because she said ""rey Skywalker"" that does not work, so an overall dissapointment of a conclusion to one of my favorite franchises.",0

There, that's my opinion. This is somewhere in between.<br /><br />As a SW movie it's not the worst, by a long shot. It looks and sounds great, has some great action sequences but suffers from too much macguffin plotting and clichéd dialogue. Everyone in it gives their all, fair enough. This, without the ending would've been a decent sequel to TLJ, a nice filler movie I suppose but as a curtain closer for an entire 42yr, 12 movie (including Clone Wars) arc, it's disappointing. Does it have a lot of fan service? Yes, yes it does but know this, without franchise fans, the studios wouldn't get funding for more movies so looking after the fans has to be high on your priority list.<br /><br />Will I watch this again? Yes, definitely. It certainly isn't boring and more importantly, unlike TLJ, it feels like SW.<br /><br />That said, please no more.

It's like a fanfiction written by a 12 year old that doesn't really understand Star Wars yet, but knows how to generate the FEEL of a fun Star Wars story. It's so bad that it's actually fun to watch it all fall apart. Some of the cringier lines even have PERFECTLY TIMED pauses where you have exactly enough time to realize what the next line is and audibly say something like ""She better not say it..."" and then she says it.<br /><br />This is the first ""So bad it's good"" Star Wars movie, and it might actually be my all-time-favorite ""so bad it's good"" movie because it's not exclusively bad. The effects are generally amazing (with a couple notable examples that REALLY stick out in a hilarious way), the actors are clearly skilled, and there are several scenes that are legitimately good (given their context within the story) and carry significant emotional weight. These facets of the story serve to enhance the hilarity of the rest of the movie. I Laughed out loud several times. Not at the jokes, but a laugh is a laugh and I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at a movie.<br /><br />The movie theater I was in was roughly 60% empty, which really just enhanced the bizarre nature of the entire experience.<br /><br />My wife fell asleep for several minutes and immediately started laughing whe she woke up because the movie is paced so quickly that literally nothing onscreen made any sense to her after missing about six minutes. This movie should've been at least two movies, but I'm so glad that it was just one bizarre sack of plot density and contrivances.<br /><br />The first thing my wife said to me when we walked out of the theater was (while we were both laughing) ""Did we seriously just watch that? Like, did that really happen? What the (censored) even was that?""<br /><br />I'll avoid any possible spoilers, but I would NOT recommend seeing this movie in theaters. Disney needs to take a hit to the pocketbook for making the sequel trilogy in this manner. HOWEVER, I would 100% recommend watching this movie at home at some point because it is truly the most wild, yet EXTREMELY predictable, ride I've ever been on.",0

It doesn't slow down and give anyone time to breath.<br /><br />Big continuity errors, including C3PO having his memory wiped but remembering the creature that did it.<br /><br />Disney, in my opinion, should have left the franchise well alone.<br /><br />A fitting ending to Star Wars? Sadly no. No real emotion from the actors. They were being paid no matter how they portrayed their characters.<br /><br />Save your money, or wait until it arrives on a streaming service.

1350,3.0,"The pacing and many subplots aside, the main gripe many fans have with the movie is how it invalidated Episodes 1-6. Bringing back the original villain without any clear explanation as to how they survived makes it hard for most of the fans to suspend their disbelief. It could've been a great cop-out for a problematic trilogy if it wasn't executed so terribly. If you're a casual viewer, this film is watchable. You have the amazing effects, cool action sequences and musical score by the great John Williams. But if you're after a satisfying closure to 42 years of storytelling, this will only break your heart as it did mine. This should have been bigger than Endgame-- we're talking about four decades of storytelling right here. It's a rare shared cultural experience for all ages. And what did we get?

It was not an Oscar winner script, directed as an orchestra or the best acted movie in the world. But then again, it wasn't aiming for that.<br /><br />I don't see myself so eager to go to the movies for any movie as this one agains. It was, as advertised the end of a saga. Today I'm happy por what I saw, but, them again, I'm very, very sad, because I don't see any spark of something that will make 40 years of History, with a capital H.

1366,8.0,"WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD. READ ONLY IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE.<br /><br />There suuure is a lot of fanboysm about Star Wars. Having just seen the movie, and reading some reviews here, it feels people have seen another original trilogy than me. A lot of stuff people complain about are trade marks of the Star Wars original movies. Like the movies just jumping into action, without prior warning. All 3 original movies do this. There is a written story at the very beginning of each movie and the movie jumps right in to this preset situation. Or that there are black, asian and women characters... the original trilogy has also been quite revolutionary with a very independent woman, Leia, and a very black Lando. BTW, there are talking bugs, pigheads, a bunch of very diverse lifeforms and all you focus on are human races and gender. My 2 minus stars are for A.overuse of special effects B.slight story inconsistencies. In regards to 1, yes there is a difference to the original story, and even compared to episodes 1-3. But the real story is still there. A bit burried under a lot of fancy shiny CGI, but it is there. Episodes 1 to 3 were about the turn of Anakin to Vader and the birth of the Empire. Episodes 4 to 6 were about the development of Luke and Leia, and the undoing of Vader and the Empire. Episodes 7 to 9 are about the development of Rey and Kylo, the battle against the rebirth of the empire out of chaos and the final battle between jedi and sith. You still see Han redeeming his son, and a heartfelt farewell to Leia, as well as a reedeming scene with Luke. In regards to B, it is a bit weird when for example Kylo and Ray fight over a ship which takes over, that when they bring the ship down, Rey runs away and Kylo... does what? Not show, the film just cuts to another scene. There are also other small issues but nothing big really. Regarding the end, some things can be guessed, such as many more ships coming to help, or Kylo coming to help Rey, but not everything can be guessed. And Kylo's sacrifice is an interesting way to end it, as both the Palpatines and Skywalkers arch comes to a common end, to a common being, Rey. Overall, for me it was not bad, really. A bit too much noise, and inevitable small plot i consistencies due to this, but the main points were hit quite well, in my opinion, and I have seen the original trilogy well before all the other movies. I would not say I recommend the movie, but it is the best of the new trilogy.",1

1372,,"Everything that George Lucas gave us from The Phantom Menace to The Return of the Jedi are completely dismantled within a few minutes of the film, although it has been going on since The Last Jedi. In The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker, the man who spent years and years of training and learning the ways of the Jedi suddenly thinks that they shouldn't exist anymore and are the ones that brought Emperor Palpatine into power and let the Empire take over. What? Did he not learn anything in those years of study or is it just lazy/inconsistent writing? In the matter of a few sentences Disney just dismantled Episodes I-III as well as VI, everything that the Order stood for out the window. Then we move onto Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (although Rey is a Palpatine and just calls herself a Skywalker). In the opening scene we learn that Emperor Palpatine the somewhat immortal sith ruler himself is alive and well. WHAT? Turns out he didn't die in the final magnum opus in Return of the Jedi when he fell down the shaft and exploded into a million particles (ironically reminds me of Darth Maul). Palpatines death was the most significant death in all of the franchise, his death symbolized the freedom of Anakin from the control and manipulation that he endured for years and aided Luke on the path of righteousness and freedom as well to not follow in his father's footsteps and become what Anakin did not want to be. Bringing him back destroyed all of that. Palpatines death was teased for for the whole original trilogy. Having Darth Vader aka Anakin kill him was the redemption that he needed to finally break free. Disney and JJ Abraham spat in the face of everything that Anakin, Luke, and the Jedi Order worked so hard to do for SIX WHOLE MOVIES! If you were going to bring Palpatine back they could have at least made him a force ghost to try and persuade Kylo in his endeavours, that would have been more believable more that anything, have him as the one pulling the strings once again but on Kylo. Or just don't bring him back at all.",1

This Disney style that the good guys always win is stupid, the end of a Saga should end with a almost win of the evil to show everyone that life isn't perfect and sometimes bad things prevail. To show that even with Jedi and ships, sometimes is hard to destroy the enemy, they copied a dialogue between two characters from a previous film, the dialogues are poor and everything looks like a mass, not a total madness, but like a mess. Anyway, sorry for my English, I just like to thank JJ Ambrams for this ""amazing"" film, and ask him why George didn't appeared at the premiere, he was too tired? Or sad?

Unfortunately Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker is heavy on the pander and downright amateurish on story telling. What attempts to pass for a cohesive story is a series of scenes that jump from place to place for almost 2 1/2 hours. Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren all regress in character depth and exploration. The big reveal of Rey's origins is interesting but script is so bland in spots and laughable in others that it renders the reveal nearly pointless. There was several wrongs from The Last Jedi that I had hoped would be made right by J.J. Abrams but sadly we only get horse like creatures running on a moving space ship...while in space! Just absurd. It seems the force has left the building.",0

There's a lot of loose threads to wrap up in the movie, and in great Star Wars fashion a number of new ones get introduced, but it's a fun-filled romp from start to finish, full of heart and heroism. And, yes, there's a little bit of fan service - we get a few old faces and references along the way - but it doesn't slow anything down. It's great, great fun in the best Star Wars tradition. This is one I'll watch over and over again - easily the best of the new trilogy.",1

1405,10.0,"I wanted to share with you (while it is still fresh, after my first screening - last night at 10:15 PM) my thoughts on Star Wars - The Rise of Skywalker - Episode 9.<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />The opening scene - with Kylo Ren in search for the hidden lair of Palpatine is wonderful. We see here (and throughout the movie) how much more Kylo's strenght in the Force has grown. He is more physical, more angry/determined to find the elusive Emperor. To get to him, he must find one of the only 2 devices that would lead him where Palpatine was hiding all along.<br /><br />Rey's training with Leia - we also see Rey's growth under the tutelage of General Leia. Of course, the scenes here would have been even more amazing and touching if Carrie Fisher would have actually played them live (but more on that on the Dislikes below). Still... seeing Rey training reminded me of young Luke, in Episode 4 (A New Hope), training with Old Ben Kenobi :) instead we have Leia, telling her how she can be one with the Force.<br /><br />Piggy-backing on the above... Young Luke & Leia Training Flashback - it was such a great surprise, and another nod to the original trilogy, to see Luke training Leia as well in the ways of the Force. Seeing Leia, having her own sword, knowing the potential we have lost there... It is bitter-sweet! And it was great seeing that, even if just for a moment, on the big screen. This is probably the only CGI piece of Leia that Carrie's family could have accepted.<br /><br />The Force Bonds! are more powerful than ever! This time they are able to somehow manipulate time and space and come in the presence of one another, to transfer themsleves from one location to another, according to where they are. The scene from the ice plant, Kijimi, is particularly nicely done - with Rey and Ben fighting: Rey aboard Kylo's Star Destroyer and Kylo (trying to find Rey) on the planet. They Force connect and there is a constant swamp of the transporting from one location to the other. It is so darn cute when Kylo says to Rey to stay put as he'll come and get her ;)))",1

1414,5.0,This movie looked like it was a extra 30 minutes long but it has been cut through out the film to shorten the movie because of this the rise of skywalker doesn't allow you to breath and take in the parts of the movie that are brilliant (which there are some) due to this you fill no empathy gor certain story's/ characters. A very disappointing ending to the film but also the saga as a whole.,0
1415,1.0,"Boring, at times really ridiculous which at least made us laugh and it's so long.

1416,1.0,"Disney can make a new space sci-fi, fantasy movie all they want. Just don't title it Star Wars. I can guarantee that nobody that worked on this last 3 movies have any idea what Star Wars is about... and that includes Kathleen Kennedy.",0
1417,5.0,"I've waited to review this movie so that I had time to take it all in. I cannot call this a bad movie. It's not lacking for action and spectacle yet somehow with all that is going on in this movie it forgets to make you care. There seems to be nothing truly at stake and at no point do you feel the heroes are in any real danger. Add to this a blatant and obvious hint early on at something which will come later and the expectation that the audience can swallow this pill and accept that what happens makes any sense at all and you have a big, full, beautiful empty shell of a story which also manages to undermine Luke's and Anakin's entire story arc. If you're fairly young and perhaps the newest trilogy was your first Star Wars experience and these characters are the ones you are invested in then you might love this. If you are older like me and grew up with the original than I advise you to stick to The Mandalorian to feel any of the magic you once associated with Star Wars. Even the prequel trilogy in its misguided and often cheesy glory somehow managed to retain some of the heart and emotion so absent from this film. Like so many I left TLJ feeling ok about it but over time I came to have bigger issues with it. However, this TROS has changed my opinion to considering it the best of the new franchise in the risks it took. You may say it disrespected Luke and maybe it did but it did give Luke the glorious spotlight for the final act of the film where TFA and TROS gave Luke 5 minutes of passing fan service. Circling back to how I opened.... this is certainly not a bad movie. It is beautifully shot despite serious pacing problems with jumping from one scene to another, has plenty of Easter Eggs to enjoy and there is no shortage of action but if you're seeking that special, magical feeling you used to get when those sprawling opening credits came before the original trilogy films I do not believe you will find it with this one. All in all an ok film on its own but a colossal disappointment in terms of living up to its title and closing out the Skywalker saga for good.",0

1426,3.0,"A theme with this ""trilogy"", if one could even call it that, is the apparent cherry-picking of what to take from the previous Star Wars films.<br /><br />These new movies seem to add their own ideas that change the whole premise of Star Wars, and I'm not even a huge fan. The inability to follow a constant narrative all while introducing fantastic new ideas and powers so fanciful they re-write that whole universe is disorientating.<br /><br />Super-SUPER-powered people, ""force"" abilities that transcend anything and everything we have ever seen, and new battle tactics that would have changed every battle since the very first movie are just some of the issues.<br /><br />Add to that the ease of how the characters find exactly what they need along the way just waters down any so-called story.<br /><br />Lazy writing, but if a ship has enough power and tech to destroy a planet, jump between points in space faster than light, and is basically the size of a small city, it can certainly control its ascent out of the atmosphere. I have seen boats do it with radar, or even plain on eyesight. Just lame and too predictable, but look, lasers...<br /><br />These newer movies seem to trip over themselves trying to rewrite the past, while losing any semblance of good story telling along the way.<br /><br />This ""trilogy"", which seems to be loosely linked at best, would have been better named ""Trilogy, A Star Wars Story"" as it tries to change a whole existing universe, yet doesn't add much to it but more CGI.

But we all know the answer to that, which is megabucks and if it has a ton of explosions and CGI it's probably going to make that. Curiously, the most entertaining franchise movie by far in the past 20 years was Rogue One, not a member of the Vaunted Nine, that one actually worked the way they all should. Star Wars was never high on character development, by the time we get to this I only care (remotely) for Ridley, I couldn't care anything about anyone else because I have no reason to. And no mix of CGI, funny new worlds and redone old worlds can fix that. My 14-year-old and I left at 1:20 in and never looked back. I don't care how it ended. Enjoy.",0

There were so many moments in the movie that made me angry for the wrong reasons, facepalm, and left my mouth wide open that I wanted to leave. Carrie Fisher's death was so disrespected in this film and they did nothing for Peter Mayhew who passed away earlier this year. There's so much more crap that I hate about this trilogy but it's 3:30 am as I'm writing this review, so I'm sleepy and don't want to write it out since it's already been said by many other people. What makes me hate this trilogy even more is that seeing The Force Awakens on it's premiere night was the final thing me and my uncle did together before he passed away a month later.

1474,9.0,"""The Rise Of Skywalker"", directed by J.J. Abrams, marked the ending to the decades old saga of Star Wars. Having a totally different theme from the tradition, with the core basics being pretty much the same, the film was never expected to satisfy everyone alike. However, as much as the hatred The Last Jedi recieved, I must say The Rise of Skywalker is totally a different case here. But to begin, remember, no sci-fi films are flawless & this one's no exception. With an inconsistent pace at times, the story still manages to act as a great conclusion with lots of unexplained aspects.",1

1480,8.0,"A gloriously fast-paced and consistently entertaining final chapter in the Skywalker saga! Kylo Ren is on a bloodthirsty search for Rey and to realising his full potential as a Sith Lord. All the while, Rey has completed her Jedi training and is close to finding out the truth about her parents. When an old threat arises from the ashes, she works with her allies, such as Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn, to bring the dark side of the force to a stand still once and for all. I was very often on the edge of my seat watching this due to the sheer joy of its action set pieces and character interactions! My breath was truly taken away by the incredible spectacle that the landscapes have been realised in; from the gothic underworld of the Siths dwellings to the epic desolation of an old relic rediscovered, its a treat to behold. Without giving too much away, the villain returning is just so epic and made for a fantastic final antagonist in the series. Plenty of emotional heft and the characters stories coming to a close near perfectly (I honestly didn't see many problems with the storytelling on first watch) this is thrilling action sci-fi cinema. Now... how about that rumoured Jabba the Hutt spinoff helmed by Guillermo Del Toro",1

The new trilogy is FAR darker and grittier than the original. The film has some amazing revelations and amazing fun.

Happily, this film, at least for me, came out better than I expected. Is this going to capture all the wonder and awe we felt as that first Star Destroyer came across the screen in 1977? Well, no. But is it as terrible as the bad reviews say. No again. I think it tied together the story of Rey and Ben while giving us characters from the original storyline and their parts played well. It has some emotional moments that feel genuine and honest, and overall felt satisfying. So, go with an open mind, and enjoy it for what it is..a good film that's entertaining, and some nice storytelling as well.",0

The story made almost no sense, half of the time I didn't really know what the heck was going on or why (Other than to fill 2.5 hrs with what probably could have been a short special on Disney+). The decisions made in this movie were made poorly. Fans were upset that Rian Johnson tried to do something different, so JJ Abrams and Lucasfilm took a step back and made the same ol rubbish. There were things I enjoyed about this film, but when I pay to see a movie, I don't want a nostalgia trip. I expect the story to have a purpose. This was supposed to be the grand conclusion to the legendary Skywalker Saga, and nothing felt grand. If you hated the prequels, this series of movies makes them look like gold. Kind of makes you wish they didn't even make the new trilogy because the saga ended so perfectly with Return of the Jedi. This film was not a good conclusion to a saga many of us loved like a friend.",0

1502,7.0,"I'm a bit finicky about Star Wars because neither the original trilogy nor the prequels left a lasting impression on me. This leaves me in a peculiar position where I am fairly immune to the nostalgia hooks that Disney tried to live off of in the newest trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker is not as bad as some are making it out to be, and certainly not as bad as The Last Jedi. Fans across the world are so disappointed in this movie because they expect more in a finale. If this was a stand alone film it is decent, but it closes Star Wars out with a whimper.",0

In the past couple of days, reviews across all major social media platforms have been mixed, mostly negatives and well, we will try our best to add to the good noise. Why is that you ask? Primarily because in this trilogy, this is the one where Carrie Fisher or Princess Leia is at the forefront and it's been a long time coming. We would've seen more of her the same way we did with Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in The Force Awakens and Harrison Ford as Han Solo in The Last Jedi, if not for her untimely demise in 2016. Thanks to technology, unused footages and permission from her family, we see Ms. Fisher gets the send-off she deserves, and hopefully in some other capacity in the future films as was said by one character in the movie: ""No one's ever really gone.""",1

He had an open slate to take the story with whatever characters he wanted to dream up and he absolutely ballsed it up big time with bad characters and a rehashed story lifted from IV. Then RJ took the helm and destroyed any conceivable storyline leaving us with no characters, a total disregard to any Jedi laws and a dead end of a plot. So yes JJ had his work cut out for sure and there was no way he was going to be able to conceive a valid story to lead on with that would also wrap of not just a trilogy but the entire saga. So he fudged it basically, dazzled us with whizx bangs, chases, irrelevant characters and explosions to try and divert our attention away from the fact that it was all just grabbing at straws. He knew it, the actors and Disney knew it and the fans know it too. This is storytelling at it's very worst which is what made the SW universe so appealing in the first place. It's an insult to the medium and needs to be buried as soon as possible and I for one will be glad it's finally over.",0

1516,5.0,"For what is expected from a Grade A movie and a Grade A Franchise this is the most awful scene cutting, short verse acting I have ever seen since Arnold Schwarzenegger and Van Dam put together. the Disney franchise failed once again due to Kathleen Kennedy at the helm (Aladdin had awful scene cutting, The Lion King Awful scene cutting, Dumbo so far the best of the 4 still had some scene cutting) KATHLEEN KENNEDY should be FIRED from Disney period! I have nothing against women's rights but attacking and infiltrating story franchises that where clearly written for men is like HITLER burning Jewish books in front of Germany's government Library.. If your going to make headway for womens rights do not infiltrate current storylines written for men but make your own and make them good for all to see. I have consulted with Star Wars experts and they hate it! they hate it! they hate it and they hate it! The storylines do not match from the previous books and scripts, everything is action but no expansion on the details. If senator Palpatine can survive the fall then where is Mace Windu? Another horrible transition and leading into a confusing cut scene for example Why would you put a slow scene into a action scene, My heart is racing and then your showing me a home cooking show back and forth... absolutely sad, too many people have given this a 10 out of pure ignorance, the peoples joy is very misplaced where professionalism in the art of theater should be more expressed and should not be based solely on its action scenes. The worst part of this movie which angered most of the experts is ""Senator Palpatine"" regaining his powers and ability and then Disney decided to end it right there? WTF Disney? You could of expanded to a 2nd part movie for next year just like Return of the Jedi but nope they jumped tracks on this one and did whatever they wanted to do. I felt Disney decided to end the Movie like they turned on the lights on a couple reaching their climax in bed. No excuse to use trillions of dollars as an excuse to claim this is a great movie!

1523,4.0,"Given the backlash to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I expected Episode IX to be a fan service heavy movie that played it safer than the previous movie. It would make sense, considering that Empire was followed by Return of the Jedi that was closer in spirit to the first movie. As someone who enjoyed the Force Awakens, and loved the Last Jedi, I was expecting was a well-made and character-driven story that would expand on what came before and tie up any loose ends. As the opening scene happened, I was super excited, Kylo killing weird cult like soldiers and being a badass, then as the movie went on, I had the growing feeling of J.J. Abrams shrinking the galaxy. Everything in this trilogy feels like a take back, and when I thought they would play it relatively safe, I could not imagine the real nightmare I was in for. The problem with TROS is that it walks back a number of genuinely great reveals and plot threads from the last movie, and spends its entire run time adding painful ""plot twists"" to try and please ""toxic, screaming, fans"" that they are still the ""chosen ones"" of the pop culture galaxy. Forget all the great and interesting things about the sequels, don't worry, Snoke gets a backstory, Rey's parents are someone, and there's plenty of cameos that'll cater to some Star Wars fans. I just find it so weird that the 1 star reviews for TLJ all say it's not what fans wanted to see, and all the 1 star reviews for TROS say it's just not very good. But also all the 5 star reviews of TLJ talk about how it's a great film, and all the 5 star reviews for TROS talk about how it ticks all the boxes that ""fans wanted to see"". The RT critic and audience score being polar opposite is nothing new, but it is something interesting to consider. I fall on the side of critics in the cast of most Star Wars movies. This movie is all about he destination and not the journey, but to me at least, the best Star Wars movie are all about the characters. This movies break neck pace doesn't help either, it's relentless from minute one. Maybe two or three small moments are allowed to be compelling, but that's it, there just small moments and there's not enough of them. It's all go, go, go and I just want it to slow down. It's shorter than the last movie which baffles me, this really could have benefited from a longer run time to explain things and allow for breathing room. So many things are hand waved, how is Palpatine back? Clones! Where did he get his fleet? Idk... who were all those hooded dudes on Exegol? Idk either... When did Palpatine have a son? Who cares... for me... this movie broke my heart. I'm so bummed that Star Wars has to succumb to the dark side, and try to please everyone and their mothers, stick with the story you were telling. The Last Jedi set it up for virtually anything to happen, and the best JJ and Chris Terrio can come up with, is a thousand Death Stars... really? That's it? Great... whatever... TLJ is so much better than this...",1

1525,6.0,"The Rise of Skywalker walks back on or hastily retcons some points of The Last Jedi during its first few minutes and that is the biggest problem with the new trilogy. It's the problem that plaques many tv- series, the uncertainty of direction. When a tv- show starts, the creators and the writers don't necessarily have any idea where the show is going to go. Anything could happen during a long production, especially with a show that spans multiple seasons. The same goes with this new Star Wars trilogy. There doesn't seem to be an overall agreed theme here. Rian Johnson made some of his own decisions about the direction of the trilogy in The Last Jedi and here J.J. Abrams takes a step back and goes off in another direction.",0
1526,3.0,I feel like I'm late to the party on this movie and I certainly echo the general consensus here. First some background: I grew up in the 90s so I saw the initial trilogy well after their release but loved them as a child. I played many of the video games and I was well versed in the lore. When the prequels dropped I was now in my twenties and at best they were disappointing and I had all but ceased to care about the Star Wars universe; partly as a result of getting older and partly because of the taint of the prequels.,1

Rey and a bunch of useless men are back again to investigate a broadcast by Palpatine. You know the villain from the good Star Wars movies because JJ Abrams is such a great writer. Kylo Ren is also back after being beaten twice by a girl who picked up a lightsaber two hours ago. Both Rey and Kylo are looking for a maguffin that will lead to another maguffin that finally get them to defeat Palpatine. What I like so much about Rise of Skywalker is that it gets things like plot, character development, compelling storytelling and logic out of the way so you can go back home and forget everything you just watched. It feels like Disney decided that plotting out multiply films was alt right so to play it safe they just decided to make up everything as they went along, which makes sense and I commend them for saving me from thinking for myself.",0

1555,7.0,"Hard-core fans need to settle down and appreciate this series in its entirety for what it is. Even the originals had plot holes. Star Wars, for me, has always been about expansive world-building which each one, even the prequels, managed.<br /><br />I give extra appreciation to this one, regardless of its flaws, as a final homage to Carrie Fisher who was a positive and defining figure of pop culture.",1
1556,9.0,"Just to preface this review: at the age of 9, I saw Star Wars in the theater 7 times (4 of the times by myself as I couldn't get anyone to go with me again. Keep in mind, that movies stayed at theaters for months at a time back then). I have also read 11 Star Wars books (none of them considered cannon as I read this 18-20 years ago).",1
1557,7.0,"I hated the Last Jedi. I went into this with low expectations. Well JJ stuck the landing. He did the best he could with what he had left to work with. This movie was clearly convoluted with a plot made from elements of a patchwork of what was left over from TLJ. Palpatine was brought in because Kylo REN was not a good enough villain to carry us though the movie. A lot of things just went unexplained, but the pacing doesn't really give you time to think about that. It was fantastic getting Mr Billy D Williams back. Shoulda been there from day 1. There are elements from this film, like the bonds formed between the new trio of Finn, Rey and Poe that should have been there in TLJ. It all came together in this film. Background characters stayed in their lane. Leia was treated as she should have been... Royalty. It was as if she was really in the film. The new guy who played Chewbacca may be up for an Oscar. Not kidding about that. Threepio and R2 were brought back into the fold and not just cast aside in favor of the newer droids on the team. This movie worked and is a more fitting sequel to TFA than TLJ was. 7/10 stars. There were a few things I didn't like, but that would be spoilers. Overall, Great Job JJ. You saved Star Wars.",1
1558,5.0,You would think that with all the money Disney has they could have at least spent a 10th of it on writers to actually come up with a decent story. The visual's are what you would expect from a Star Wars film but the story is just blah. Weak story made even weaker by the ending. Sad day for the Star Wars franchise pretty much solved the need to go to any future Disney produced Star wars movies.,0
1559,5.0,"I'm in the camp that enjoyed The Last Jedi. Not everything worked in that movie but I appreciated Rian Johnson taking chances and doing some unexpected things, which was a breath of fresh air. This is my least favourite Star Wars movie since Attack Of The Clones. This movie spends too much time trying to undo what LJ established, frenetic action with characters delivering lines with no time to breath, contrived story to link this all to the original 6 movies when one can clearly see that they absolutely had no clue where they were taking this story when starting with Force Awakens, among other gripes. There were some good character moments, the actors did the best they could with what they had and it looked great but these moments were few and far between.",1

1563,5.0,"I'm not a fanboy, I don't have a special relationship to the original trilogy even though I do appreciate them and accept them as timeless classics.

Other than the visuals and the beautiful score by John Williams I don't see anything special here. The magic is gone, there is nothing left of what made Star Wars great in the first place. If not for the success with the original trilogy this movie wouldn't even make it to the big screen.<br /><br />Disney don't have any respect for their viewers, as long as they see profit they couldn't care less what the general public thinks and this movie proves it.<br /><br />Save your money kids.",0

The best thing that could have happened was to have Rey take the Sith throne and Ben become the risen Skywalker. This was rubbish. Disney and their over indulgence of cute creatures also is such a take away from a once mature space opera. JJ Abrams should be done in Hollywood.,1

That's what Rise of Skywalker did for me. I have loved Star Wars movies since I was a child. Darth Vader being my favorite. I have a son who has continued my love of Star Wars, going so far as to have a Darth Vader themed bedroom, before it was popular. We talk about the characters and movies. Had to get Disney + so we could bing them. I however am not the type of person who picks apart every aspect of the movies. I have a life and see them for what they are, entertainment. I was thoroughly entertained in this movie. I will see it again too. If you simply love Star Wars and don't need to critique every nook and cranny then you will love this movie. It has a rich blend of old and new. I must admit I was sad to see a character die, however, it was a sacrifice, just like Darth Vader's. I won't say who it is, but it was understandable, yet still saddening because you will never know what might have been. Overall, it was amazing!",1

We just kept giving Disney money for more garbage to be thrown at us and we deserved all of this.<br /><br />The movie was clearly written, produced and shot by people who disregarded the original material, however decided to keep the title and pay some of the original actors to come back.<br /><br />In this move we watch more needless deaths, main villain somehow reappearing out of nowhere, broken and unfinished plots, and finally the obvious happening.<br /><br />The sad part is that Disney ruined it and we just paid them to do it.",0
1580,3.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is a laudable attempt to retcon the disasterpieces that were The Last Jedi and (to a lesser extent) The Force Awakens out of existence. Unfortunately short of claiming the the previous two films were just a nightmare or hallucination it was never going to work. The filmmakers didn't have the temerity to just bin everything in TFA and TLJ so they were forced to work around the inanity of what came before while also trying to cram a satisfying three-movie arc into one film. The result is overstuffed hyperactive nonsense that utterly fails as either a standalone movie or, more importantly, the capstone to a legendary franchise. But at least they tried for once.",0
1581,2.0,"As a kid, I was a fan. Saw the original trilogy movies (in all its forms) about 200 times (in total).

I actually enjoyed The Last Jedi (even more with each time I've seen it) but yes, it does have it flaws.<br /><br />So, my expectations weren't that high, but at least if it got to the level of TFA the closure would be boring but decent.<br /><br />There is very little I liked about Rise Of Skywalker. The story (as far as there is any) is too dumb to mention. The typical rehasing of some familiar elements by J.J. Abrams didn't work.

Episode 9 had everything for fans; new locations and aliens, saber duels, climactic battles. Each character was handled respectfully which was nice to see. Cameos made the film a little more fun and the comedic lines weren't overly cheesy. The climax felt like a true end and J.J. honored the past by bringing in the voices of all of our favorite jedi from over the years. Luke, redeemed. Leia, finally at peace. No better place to end the Skywalker Saga than on Tatooine.",1

He spent two movies sucking upto him to now get rid. And Leia - is now all of a sudden a Jedi master with lightsaber training? Luke and Lando only seem to have been added as an after thought. And all star destroyers suddenly have Death Star powers? The movie is a mess and the ending is a huge mess. Never been so bored either in a SW movie. Really dragged. And lastly no explanation whatsoever how the emporer is back and only now wants to take over. Oh, and Reys parents are not anyone. She's the emporers alleged grand daughter. And the skywalker in the name of the film is probably for some reason referring to her as that is what she calls herself at the very end. Stupid",0

1601,5.0,"I was never a fan of the Star Wars saga, but the brilliant trailer and John Williams' score made it look truly epic. Sure there were many spectacular battles, and action, but plotwise the story seemed average. I appreciate the cameos from the original characters, but that is not enough to lift the movie. Rey's relationship with Kylo Ren was one of the most distracting moments for me in the previous installment and I dreaded having to see it play out here. Fortunately, their relationship/conflict was bearable but failed to provide any emotional anchor to the story. Daisy Ridley's Rey does not have much but to frown and scream; though she does great action scenes. John Boyega's Finn is pretty useless too, and I feel they could have used him better in the story. The only great thing about The Rise of Skywalker is John William's theme playing during the spectacularly explosive space battles. That almost makes up for the admission price. But if you are looking for an emotional send off, none here.",1
1602,,Ignore all the poor reviews for this movie it was amazing! Of the entire film there were only two things I didn't like. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!!! I laughed. I cried.

1605,3.0,"A complete cinematic disaster from start to finish that retroactively ruins the previous 2 sequel trilogy films and does lasting damage to the overall sagas narrative arc. Such a mess on every level from pacing and editing to logical plot development. It's also completely derivative of other Star Wars material with barely any new ideas and it chose to pick some of stupidest elements of the old EU to canonize (Palpatine is Back Alive). I love Star Wars but because of this film to me it will always end at VI, I'll pick and choose what I want after that but VI is a much better ending to the franchise than this.... So overall it's a 3/10 for VFX and some solid performances but it's definitely one of the worst blockbuster films I have ever seen.",0

If you go for escapism, big set pieces, lots of action, sensory overload, and only demand a minimum level of emotion and storytelling, you may actually like The Rise of Skywalker. But as the conclusion to a 9 episode saga, as well of a trilogy, and as a good story in its own right, this is a very rushed, messy, and wholly unsatisfying finale...There are some unintentionally hilarious moments throughout and the fan service and sentimentality and emotional manipulation is laid on very thick. In Fact Rise of Skywalker relies on nostalgia for most of its emotional scenes....the biggest problem is the storytelling decisions, lapses in logic and established concepts being pushed aside lazily in service To a very bad script...its not entirely awful. The actors, particularly Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver do a fine job and their scenes together are pretty good. And Jar Jar Abrams knows how to direct action and keep the energy going...overall its a piece of crap though. In many ways the worst Star Wars movie",0

Sacrifices made in the original are pushed to one side as a planned trilogy was never set in advance the emperor is ushered in again. The only reason to watch this is the performances.

We were astonished by the special effects and my parets proudly told us that they use to watch this movie in cinema years ago. From that moment on I fell in love with Sci-Fi. Star Wars opened my heart for a hole new universe full of possibilities and adventures, and it was a done deal. I was about to become a nerd for sure :)",1

Tired of Disney appeasing the LGBTQ minority as well. The ending with two women kissing and hugging was disgusting and inappropriate.,0

1622,1.0,I'll never get the 4 minutes and 17 seconds back that I wasted on this utter tosh.,0
1623,7.0,"The movie is a solid ending to the new trilogy. It was so many emotive, nostalgic moments that worked great on me and moved me. For example, seeing Luke and Leia in their prime, training, or Luke lifting his X-Wing out of the sea. The overall pace is perfect. Never slows down, never gets boring. Rey's internal struggle is equally solid and visual. Seeing Rey throwing lightnings out of her hands was impressive and shocking. And, although I didn't hate Last Jedi, JJ gets extra credits for fixing that little mess.<br /><br />On the other hand, there a few things I felt were unnecessary. First off, obviously, that weeeeeird kiss. Not set-up, no reason for it. Second, some characters and the confusing romantic relationship between characters. It felt like at one point, Rey could end up with anyone in the cast. Then, Poe gets his girl, and nothing comes out of it. Then Finn, who kissed Rose in the last film, meets another character, also former stormtrooper, but nothing comes out of it either. Neither of those two characters felt special, and neither really adds anything. They're only there because the plot needs them.<br /><br />I also feel that, even though I liked the climax, Palpatine never felt unbeatable. He was, in fact, just a little dull for me. I did like how Rey came from behind and beat Palpatine, and I liked how Kylo sacrificed for her. Also, Palpatine being Rey's grandfather was great for me.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice ending for the trilogy, and presumably the saga. I admit being on the verge of tears in a few occasions. I liked it! The denouement with Rey saying she's a Skywalker in Tatooine was beautiful.",1

I don't understand why there are some particular scenes in this, like the event at kijimi. I know they want to include some backgrouds of Poe, but this is a waste scene. This scene hardly contribute anything to the progression of this movie. Also, there are some scene that the director want us to feel sad like when they try to make us believe that Chewie is death or the scene when C3PO memory is erased. I felt so unrelated with these scene, and I thought why they needed to to this. You have many other choices to make audience feel sad ,but you make these illogical scenes.",0
1626,8.0,"I'm going to step right into the fray here. Dyed in the wool fans are hating it, while, at the same time, it is being criticized for pandering to long time fans. Honestly, how could J.J. Abrams win? My perspective is that of a lover of movies. I've seen all the blockbuster SciFi films over the years, I know all the Star Wars films and have enjoyed some more than others, but I didn't come to this film with a pony in the race. I came to see a good finale to a landmark series, with good story telling, characters to invest in, some new novelty worlds and characters, solid performances, spectacular CGI, and a proper send off. I found all these things. The film was super busy with lots of information and special effects coming at you all at once (I really should see it again to catch it all). Outstanding moments for me were: the way Carrie Fishers' footage, shot before her death in 2016, was woven into the film (her legacy was honoured); spectacular special effects; imaginative creature creations and world building; how the storyline came full circle for both the heroes and the villains; the epic, internal struggles of Rey and Benjamin, and the way that struggle was resolved; and, I loved the themes of hope and fraternity. In short, I enjoyed this movie. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {SciFi, Classic, Adventure, Action}",1

1660,8.0,"It's become fashionable to hate on anything JJ Abrams or that Kathleen Kennedy and her cadre of Disney shills don't get Lucas's vision. To the ""Star Wars"" fanboys out there, you've lost your memory.<br /><br />Those films from the 77'-'84 were CORNY. Yes, watch them again. Super cornball. But all you remember is waiting in line, or hearing it word of mouth, most likely listening to Madonna whilst doing so. So these memories are etched deeply into your nostalgic psyche.<br /><br />Enter, the millenium. Technology has grown and social media blew up. Now we could communicate with each other through the air. Comment, criticize and destroy. This is the power wielded by some sad obese basement dwellers who have dedicated a portion of their lives to seek and destroy, anything that touches their precious memories. If you can be honest with yourselves and see this in the mirror, DON'T go to these movies. They aren't exactly for you. Nor do they cater to the new generation. Because these new ones are JUST as corny as the OG ones.<br /><br />Face it, JJ Abrams is the ONLY guy who could've maintained composure while facing these nutjob fanboys. You don't deserve Abrams to make you any Star Wars movie. You wouldn't have been happy if it were anyone doing it but yourselves. And guess what? YOU'D screw it up too. Because what is being attempted can't be done. That is to turn back the hands of time to a more innocent time in our lives. Where things like Facebook, Instagram and IMDB didn't exist. Where while we explain these movies to people we suddenly conclude that it was a pretty decent movie. ""Return Of The Jedi"" is getting some past due respect. Though it is CLEARLY the weakest of the OG (directed by Richard Marquand). Fans of this have NO CLUE what they want.<br /><br />So here we are, at the edge of the new decade. And 7-9 isn't perfect (I'm not nuts to think they're masterpieces) but neither were 4-6. Time will tell. And I think when people revisit these, when their children are older, will discover the ""whys"" of this and the previous two under Disney banner.<br /><br />I simply don't agree with the bad reviews. The film pandered to who it could to please you, and I saw that effort and I appreciated it. For those who are destroyed by the banality of this series, I pity you. This is joyous escapist cinema that doesn't exist anymore because you bring too much baggage. Leave it at home and enjoy it with your children and allow them to (possibly) see the value that is in the canon. Let it breathe for a damn minute before spewing hate.",1
1661,1.0,"It's truly sad to see how badly this film is on every level. Badly directed (especially the first act), weak storyline, no memorable scenes whatsoever. Characters were shallow and their motivation totally unclear. When Kylo dies it's hyped up as something sad but the audience legitimately laughed at it, as it was sooo poorly executed. Not Adam Drivers fault but due to the weak storyline. Episode 7 showed the potential, no matter what you think about 8 but it had some great scenes and great cinematography. This one's just a forgettable mess. The only way it could've been worse if in the end they had made Bran the King",0

Boyega and Isaac not only return as Finn & Poe, but Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels also make appearances in their original roles.

That doesn't change the fact that I love Star Wars. This is not Star Wars however. It has tons of coincidences and moments of supreme Mary Sue-ism. Yes most of the events were predictable. The one-liners are so Disney and the new characters rolling off the conveyor belts in China as I write.,0
1686,,"It's not George Lucas' vision. The main crew doesn't have the same talent has the original one. It has many loose ends... This is why it 't deserve 3/10 (I am a generous reviewer). It's not the first of the new trilogy without a proper original story. TFA was like a remake of ANH and TLJ was a mix of moments of ROTJ and TESB. This one has no original idea either, and it's a rip off one. We can argue about so many loose ends, for sure. But the story fails any expectations, it disrespects SW heritage again and conflicts (the main one, the inner conflict to go down a dark path). It's frantic and has magical battles, cartoonish light saber duels, it gives Rey more Mary Sue moments (she and JJ talked it through on the couch). There is a lot to dislike.

Taking something that started 42 years ago and has had an enormous impact on the lives of many people, including myself, is a huge undertaking. You strive to please the 50 something year old fan while trying to make it entertaining to an 8 year old. Add to this the complexity of the story and it's characters and... I think a mistake was made by having someone different create the second movie in this series. The same person (JJ Abrams) should have had creative control for all three films. This creates an additional problem with continuity. And the fact that Leia (Carrie Fisher) was to have a major part in this movie, but unfortunately passed away before production ever started, this creates a game changer. So it seems like everything was stacked against them. Was it perfect, no. There were a few things I would have changed, but overall the story worked. It can be an emotional roller coaster at times. One particular event silenced the sold out theater. But... I'll just let that there. Am I satisfied with what I saw, yes. I really think I need to see it again as our seats were horrible.

Bringing back Palpatine because the writing was that terrible and lazy and they couldn't come up with anything original. Again, using an inanimate object to somehow have feelings and memories in a dagger and yet piece of s*** Rey is using the youngling slayer 9000 for 3 movies and yet no feelings with that piece of hardware. These guys are idiots. What a travesty. And Abrams had the tenacity to say that all other works were no longer canon because his new movies are the timeline. What a dumbass.

The allure is still there (as we're seeing ... ), and, being addicted to oil and technology and roads and cars as we are, we need to address it.

Despite the hamming up and the row upon row (cut and paste) of death-Star capable star destroyers, I had not one bit of emotional investment.

After that the movie is almost too fast paced to even comprehend. It's evident that the original cut had much more than what the final cut gave us. The editing is choppy, but isn't such a problem because the movie looks so gorgeous which is to be expected with a movie with such a high budget. The film relies on fan service which is expected with this series and I didn't have a problem with most of it. After The last Jedi it seems like they spent the first two acts undoing everything that happened in the previous film. This is quite annoying because it gave it gave the last film no purpose. The reason this movie only deserves a 5/10 is because of what we as an audience knew it could have been. The third trilogy in the saga could not decide what it wanted to be and had no direction. Switching directors in the middle of it ruined it for me. Both directors had different directions and the result was a cluster of fast paced scenes and trying to do service to the original trilogy while adding new elements to make it original. It just didn't work and left fans upset.",0

At least Babu frik and Han solo carry the hell out of their scenes.<br /><br />The Trilogy was such a disaster that they brought back Lando and made Leia a stronger Jedi than Luke, super disappointed in that.

I agree that The Last Jedi wasn't a great movie but I think J.J Abrahams did a great job with this movie after what Rian Johnson did with The Last Jedi. He somewhat fixed Rian Johnson's errors in my opinion. Of course, J.J Abrahams isn't George Lucas but after watching this film it had me wishing he had directed episode VIII. People are entitled to their own opinion but today it's honestly just hard to please everyone.",1
1805,1.0,"This movie was better than the last Jedi. The last Jedi wasn't even like a star wars movie. It was ok but not that great of a movie anyway. This movie focuses too much on trying to fix those mistakes and just has stupid crap thrown in there. They try adding new characters but they don't even do anything with them. Kind of forgotten. I wish this trilogy wasn't even made. Other than Rogue one and the Mandalorian, Disney hasn't made anything good. Let's just hope they don't ruin the clone wars series.",0

1807,3.0,"A big disappointment for me. ""Let this be the final word in the story of Skywalker"" Palpatine declares. If he knew the story of Skywalker would end so vacuously, he'd probably have stayed hidden away forever. The first act thrusts you headlong into the action, but then the plot jumps all over the place & descends to a level of ridiculousness that does the franchise no justice. By the third act the film is eclipsed by its grossly unbalanced, bloated plot & I just found myself glad that it had finally reached a conclusion.<br /><br />On the flipside the film is visually stunning. The cinematography & visual effects are impressive, but they are the frosting on what is essentially a rather dry and tasteless cake. For me Rise of Skywalker is up there with Lucas' Attack of the Clones. Thoroughly unsatisfying.",0

The Last Jedi was a a mess and JJ and the other writers managed to deal with that by pretty much disregarding most of it. Turns out Snoke was just a genetically grown lab rat, Rose & Finn don't like each other that much and Luke agreed he was being a dick. Anyway this film starts out well and had me interested from the start regarding Rey's relationship with Kylo and how Palpatine pulls them all together for a finale that didn't disappoint. C3PO turns evil for a bit, chewbacca dies, Lando made me laugh & Wedge Antilles turns up (I guess they waved a nice cheque in his face this time around). George Lucas said ""Star Wars was for 12 year olds"" and if I was 12 again I'd go out and buy the toys, lunch box and tee shirt again for sure. But like I said, I'm 47 so I'll just go back to work tomorrow and wait for the next big thing.",0

1816,7.0,"Much like the episodes 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi', I'm left with sort of a ho-hum feeling about this last picture in the Star Wars franchise. It's certainly got it's share of now familiar characters and monumental action scenes, but somehow it didn't seem enough. It felt like the film makers tried to cram in as much story as possible into the picture, but in so doing gave us some confusing scenarios that don't gel very well with the past. The return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is one example, and that was a pretty major one. Internal consistency is also a problem, when someone like Rey (Daisy Ridley) can maintain an epic power struggle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) over the escaping air ship, but then has to exert herself climbing a rock face later in the picture. Why rely on human strength when you have all this mystical ability at your command? I did like the nods to the original players in the Star Wars saga, as the writers found a way to bring back Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian. That was essentially a given knowing that the nine part series had now reached it's finale, and that sort of tribute was well deserved. As one who's been around as long as the franchise, I'm pretty much happy and satisfied that the story has run it's course fulfilling George Lucas's original mission. But if you want the real magic you have to go back to 'A New Hope' and relive how it all began.",0
1817,6.0,"This movie feels like 5 hours cramped into 2,5 hours. There is so much exposition and set up needed to even remotely explain what on earth is going on. I get that a final chapter should be fast-paced. It should be the epic conclusion where everything ends. But there's a difference between being fast-paced and rushed, and this movie is very much rushed. After it ends, you feel like it didn't even deliver half of what it should have done. Some characters are disposed off so abruptly and the whole finale was without any sense of tension, not to mention a huge anti-climax concerning the villain. The plot armor is just out of this world, it feels like all our characters have god-mode on for the entire runtime. Not to mention that the villain's army is beaten in the most easy and effortless way. I hate to say this, but for me, this is the season 8 of Star Wars...",0

1819,5.0,"Apologies, but this would be hard to reflect on without spoiling. I went in with low expectations but was still disappointed. It absolutely captures the essence of Disney and what Disney is projected to do with entertainment henceforth. An empty, substanceless cash grab with sickening layers of fan service, I audibly snorted multiple times and the decisions made. I truly disliked the notion of Palpatine spawn. It pushed the boundaries of what we know about the force and lore but made many jumps and stretches with little explanation. Not to mention the Endgame final battle nod (see ""I am Iron Man"" + ""I am all the Jedi""). It felt lazy, safe, and void of creativity. I don't presume to know how to conclude a 42 year old saga of paramount importance to so many people, but I am disappointed to say I don't think JJ Abrams does either.",0
1820,3.0,"Good finish. Not a great finish. This movie deserves more credit than it is getting. I'll get into the short comings. But first a few big positives.<br /><br />1. The acting is solid. The main actors are all experienced professionals at this point. Unlike the prequels, there were no main characters that seriously lack the skills to play their role.<br /><br />2. The action was exciting and very well done. The special effects were fantastic and made for an immersive experience.<br /><br />3. Many (not all) key questions in the SW Saga were explained.

1821,1.0,"I've stayed silent for Episode 7 - while watching it, I couldn't believe amount of copying.

But this, THIS mashup of homages, cheap talks (seen in all B production movies), CGI at times truly leveled with student made ones, and at last... the STORY. Really? Really Disney guys? There's fan fiction way better than this cheap, mixed up stories. Friendships/new loves are all forced, cameo roles really serve no purpose (just to make some die-hard fans happy). And origin story is way below any normal. regular intellect level.<br /><br />One last thing to say. 6.8 is too high of a rating, and this (among other ratings of SW movies made by you/similar thingies), and I cannot help myself but to ask:<br /><br />1. is Disney corrupt, and relies on reviews<br /><br />2. is this what world has really come to? Audience who praises this as a good, developed movie?<br /><br />If correct answer is 1 - well, we just have to watch movies and not rely on ratings at all<br /><br />If correct answer is 2 - I know, I'll just keep watching movies in opposite order, rated between 1-5, that way I'll know I'll watch something worth thinking over.",1

1836,5.0,"I've been a Star Wars fan from the first trilogy that I've watched when I was 7 or 8. It was a simple yet powerful story, greatly entertaining but always - from the very beginning - with major flaws. I've always thought that it was a common thing among fans to just accept these flaws and go with it. Some great work has been done in the extended universe with the comics and recently the series ""The Mandalorian"", but when it comes to the trilogies, no masterpiece was ever there. It's always been a patchwork of inspirations with no original content but it worked with its simplicity and universality, and sometimes, with true moments of greatness. That's the way I've always considered Star Wars.<br /><br />If there is anyone to blame for the uselessness of The Rise of Skywalker, it's neither Disney, Rian Johnson or J J Abrams but the hardcore fans. The Force Awakens was not appreciated because it resembled too much of the original trilogy, The Last Jedi was hated because it had the b*lls to make something different and now The Rise Of Skywalker is hated because no creative choices were taken to make everyone happy ! It is the worst Star Wars in the entire saga because, yeah, everything that's supposed to happen, happens. That's it. No surprises whatsoever, no true moment of greatness, but a predictable plot filled with nostalgia and fan service as if to answer ""We're sorry, it won't happen again !"" to the outcry of The Last Jedi.<br /><br />Star Wars used to be simple but never dull, this time it's both.",0

Two films later we are left with the shoddiest of work and the rise of skywalker is a patch up job , a bad patch up job. Firstly Instead of bringing the emperor back from a 2000 ft drop and an explosion, surely Luke would of being the more sensible option? I'm not sure why they made the decisions they've made I just know nearly every decision through the trilogy has been bad and they tried to change direction to late and it's all just head scratching weird because the sith are now back and anakins story everything we went through has been wiped..

Rei, as the main character, is an absolutely useless character, except that he constantly gets plot tips. She has achieved absolutely nothing for the entire film. All she did was whine and listen to what voices / force told her.<br /><br />The film absolutely didn't give a damn about physics, now you can make jumps practically without calculations to any point and everything will be fine. Remember how the whole second episode they could not hide because wherever they jumped they will be tracked by a beacon? Well now, you don't need any beacons either ... They sacrificed realism for the sake of a 2-minute chase scene. Disgusting.<br /><br />Force ... Changed to make heroes even more chosen.

I know this is beating on a dead horse, but I trully despise the character of Rey. It is not an interesting protagonist because she doesn't need to overcome adversity, we started seeing this in the first movie, when she defeated Kylo, a man trained by luke himself and a Skywalker having not trained with a lightsaber herself in her life.

Absolute horrid writing. I'm afraid there are only 6 star wars films once again in the skywalker story. Hang your heads in shame writers, they done a game of thrones on our special saga. A trilogy, even though force awakens set up an epic last 2 films, will be forgotten about in a year or 2.",1
1857,7.0,"I love the Star Wars universe, but I'm a bit over the Skywalker saga. This final installment is entertaining, but the story is so bogged down by its own mythology it sucks out any spontaneity or life from the film. There are so many story threads to wrap up, Rise of the Skywalker felt like a cancelled TV show that's now having to quickly wrap all of it's plot lines. This series finale seems to be one Michael Bay style bombastic action set piece quickly moving to the next in order to close everything out. Compared to the simplicity of ""The Mandalorian,"" which is a simple straightforward story within the Star Wars universe (really, it's just ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" in the style of a spaghetti western), that series if far more fun and inventive, which is sadly lacking here. Additionally, this film lacks the texture of the original trilogy, with nothing like a cantina scene or Ewoks on Endor. And with the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher, the spliced together scenes of Leia feel awkward, forced, and distracting. This film is also lacking the nostalgia factor of The Force Awakens. Even though that film was essentially a remake of A New Hope, it was a lot of fun and captured the simple charms of the original trilogy. However, on the plus side, the return of Landau Calusions is welcome even if his screen time is far too limited (and was that his real hair?). Richard E. Grant is terrific in a thankless role as an Imperial General. Kari Russell get's to reunite with ""Felicity"" creator J.J. Abrams. Best of all, we see the return of Wedge Antilles! SPOILER ALERT, I was also glad Rylo Ken did not come to Rey's rescue in the end and she was able to rescue herself. But the lack of humor, the lack of Rose Tico, way too much CGI, and all the other above complaints make this film a disappointment. Overall, I wish Rise fo the Skywalker had either embraced the shameless nostalgia of The Force Awakens or tried to take the series in a new direction. Instead, we get a smattering of each and we're left with an extremely mixed bag. In summary, going back to Michael Bay and to use a Transformers analogy, this film is to the Mandalorian as the Transformers films are to the scaled down charm of ""Bumblebee."" Simpler is sometimes better. A disappointing end to an iconic series.",0

1875,7.0,The Rise of Skywalker had all the bells and whistles of a Star Wars movie but the story was hopelessly doomed by the mess left by Episode 8 and left more questions than answers. There is virtually no story arc in this trilogy so take this film as a stand alone and enjoy as best you can.,0

1880,9.0,It's got all the elements of Star Wars I don't understand what the big deal is. It was a lot of stuff for people to tie in together to make it work and I think it works. It's a hell of a lot better than the first three but it's not as good as the original Three. What's there not to like a couple old favorites dropped by Harrison Ford is there for a cameo. Good vs Evil that's what it's about. I applaud the Endeavor. But it's worth it in the end.,1
1881,2.0,Just enjoy the movie and be great someone bothered to entertain the fan theory.,1
1882,4.0,"Visually dark. No Baby Yoda. Air and sabertooth horses in space, nice touch. Lando was the only good character. Billy Dee did a great job, the other actors were subpar especially Rey, Poe and Finn. Adam was much better than his previous attempts, Rose and C3PO were ok. Mark Hamil got his paycheck. Harrison/ Han a force ghost ? The Rey and Leia interactions were odd and out of place. The Mace windu question was finally answered. The writing was awful, lots of boring dialog, erratic pacing. Billy Dee's and Harrison's lines were probably best in the movie and the only decent ones. The soundtrack was poorly edited, worse than Solo's. Thought I might have seen Anthony Daniels dressed as a pilot. Rey using the Skywalker name instead of her family name of Palpatine was was a nice tacky touch. The audience was quiet while leaving even though they were laughing during the previews of other films. It was pretty boring. Not a kid friendly film. Not fun or funny, not recommended.",0

1884,10.0,It's not the best Star Wars has ever offered but it's not the worst either. I thought considering Carrie Fisher passed before being able to film this movie they handled it as well as they could have in this one. The flashback to Luke training Leia was awesome. Being able to see Lando one more time was a great touch. Kylo showing remorse for killing his father was a touching moment. The thing I dislike most about Star Wars are the fake fans who never like any of the new stuff that comes out and just whine and cry about it all the time as if they own Star Wars. Most people I talk to like these movies. I love the new direction with the series' on Disney plus like The Mandalorian. They're better than movies because there's room for more hours of content.,1
1885,1.0,"Have given this 1 star as it was marginally better than the horrific ep 8. These movies were truly soul destroying to watch. It's painful to think about what a missed opportunity they were. I'm going to try get on my life now and forget they ever happened, but it'll be difficult.",1

What's wrong with making a fan pleasing movie?.... This is the best movie of the sequel trilogy. Maybe a bit cheesy and you're expected to buy in to some things but I didn't have issue with that. My biggest complaint was the self imposed timeline of 18 hours in the movie. If you can go without expectations and just let yourself enjoy 2+hours of fantasy film, you'll love this movie. Definitely worth a watch and not a bad movie at all.",1

1892,5.0,"I'll make this known right off the bat, potentially losing many of you in the process- I was a fan of both Episode 7 and 8, but for vastly different reasons. Each have their flaws, but with The Force Awakens, I felt it to be an immensely satisfying reintroduction into the world of Star Wars, effectively balancing the old and the new. Then in the case of The Last Jedi, more risks were taken that divided the fan-base more than any other film in the franchise, but it was stunningly shot, intensely emotional in parts, and with enough highs that enabled me to overlook most of the lows.",1

Despite wiping these 3 awful films from my memory, ""there is still hope!"" If Disney follow the formula for the much under rated Rogue 1 and the fantastic Mandalorian series.

1896,7.0,"Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is an alright film. The cast performs mostly well, highlighted by convincing leads. Both dialogue and comedic moments are spotty, yet character development still has strong moments. Undeniably, however, there are serious holes in the creative decisions that leave an empty feeling to much of what happens. This includes introducing somewhat unbelievable new abilities that are just too under-explained. The film does make the overall trilogy adventure more sensical, but fails in doing this totally satisfactorily. Emotionally the film has bright moments, plus some intense, grand visuals that assists the feature's eye catching nature. A classic score helps the development as well, providing for the exciting scenes that are present. Unfortunately, the storyline finds itself too ridiculous at times for the great moments to be appreciated. It seems as though the plot was overly rushed, the writers not fully developing any single part. In turn, the resolution does not feel as much a payoff as it could have been. Overall, this feature is a decently fulfilling watch that left the franchise deserving a better conclusion.",1
1897,8.0,"The battle continues. We discover Rey's heritage and I admit I was wrong about Obi-Wan. We quickly find out the Emperor and Ian McDiarmid are still alive and control little Darth as they go on planet destruction. Past characters are brought into the feature, both living and dead. Thank you for not reviving Jar Jar Binks. There is plenty of action and Rey is seemingly placed in a no-win situation. Billy Dee Williams makes a surprise return, as does Mr. Ford.",1

1902,3.0,"Let me start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan all my life, I was born in 1977 and grew up with the original trilogy.<br /><br />When the prequels came along I was very excited and left numb, so much so I have only ever watched them once in the cinema.<br /><br />Then the new films began, I enjoyed The Force Awakens, Rogue One was awesome, The Last Jedi was hit (Crait) and miss (Canto Bight) and I think Solo was good too, it's hard to create a back story for and established character that's new and original. So I went into The Rise of Skywalker with high hopes especially with the return of JJ Abrams and left feeling short changed and majorly disappointed, this film is a complete waste of potential. The scenes with Princess Leia were painful, the return of the Emperor was just silly and strange and the story seemed to bounce around and have no feeling, was VERY predictable and at times just stupid! I never thought I'd say this but I'm actually glad it's all over. Having said all this I think every Star Wars fan should watch this film but don't expect to be wowed!!! On a plus note I enjoyed my popcorn and Pepsi Max! 😃 To be honest though we took our 4 year old daughter to watch Frozen 2 and I actually enjoyed it more than this film.",0

But as I watched the film today, those criticisms just had no connection. What I saw instead was a beautiful, well-paced story that pulled at the heart strings, a glowing work that honors Star Wars and all the original and current characters. This is certainly one of the finest of all the Star Wars films.",1
1906,4.0,"For a huge fan base that grew over the years, it is insulting to come up with such a low quality production.

Most likely.<br /><br />Bitter dissapointment.<br /><br />Absolutely mediocre movie.<br /><br />I think it's time for us to take a long break from Star Wars.

1907,,"This is Star Wars, this is not Fast and the Furious, Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, or Mission: Impossible where a fun time at the cinema is just enough. Star Wars has a very special place in our culture and has as much influence, impact, and recognition as The Godfather, expectations are going to be high and there must be an attempt to meet them. Unfortunately the franchise under Kathleen Kennedy's eyes has been stumbling and fumbling and as The Last Jedi perfectly illustrated neither she or her followers care about respecting the lore, the fans, or the hero's journey with which it is supposed to pay respects towards. The prequel trilogy by Lucas was not great, but it at least was telling a cohesive storyline and had vision, where you can completely see a beginning, a middle, and an end, which is nowhere to be seen with this trilogy. The Force Awakens clearly established something, The Last Jedi threw everything out the window in favor of telling a middle and end, and here we have The Rise of Skywalker which is trying to re-do a middle and an end. Watching all three clearly illustrates that there was no idea or understanding of where to go after The Force Awakens, and that none of the writers and directors hired for each of the three episodes saw eye to eye, in particular JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson.",0

1916,7.0,"I went to see The Rise Of Skywalker yesterday with my wife, 19 year old son and 13 year old autistic son. We are all massive Star Wars fans and were so excited that the movie had finally arrived. Are overall feelings were that it was about a 7/10 and very much a missed opportunity. They simply tried to cram far too much into one movie probably as they were committed to ending the series on the 9th episode. This meant that the film felt like a series of set pieces rather than a story unwinding. It also meant that many new entries into the Star Wars world just didn't have the time to settle into the film. i.e. D-0 and Zori Bliss, they just appear without any introduction and the director assumes we will just add them to the clan without complaining. The acrobatic jump that Rey does in the desert is far more thrilling in the trailer and the moment when C-3PO says goodbye to his friends is also much sadder in the trailer, work that one out. The incredibly dangerous journey across the skyscraper sized waves could and should have been far more exciting and thrilling but once again it was skipped over like it was a walk in the park... and the second time we don't even see it! I know this is a spoiler but the appearance of Solo IS by far the highlight of the film and it says everything about the stature and charisma of Harrison Ford that apart from Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver nobody else comes near for movie presence in this move although I have to admit Richard E. Grant is very good. The climatic ending just about saves the film mainly down to the performances of Ridley and Driver. The one huge negative was the same sex kiss mainly because it stood out like a sore thumb and took us all out of the moment like great big alarm bells announcing the obligatory politically correct moment! If it's set in an undefined time in the future why does it have to relate to Earth in 2019? Surely that's the point of Sci-fi isn't it? For eight movies the Star Wars universe has been securely anchored and now you tell me that lesbianism has just come into fashion? They could have saved it for the next franchise and left the nine intact but I suppose they couldn't help themselves. Shame.",1
1917,6.0,"You know I've learnt to enjoy movies for what they are. I don't delve too deeply into logic with certain movies. Star Wars is one of those movies series that's equivalent to a box of chocolate. You'll love some hate others. What star wars does very well is offer an awesome amount of escapasim - I'm happy we have 9 plus movies to enjoy. Star Wars is a Space opera. Soap Operas frequently change story direction and move the story on as they please. And these changes often don't make sense but are always enjoyable! These movies are episodically big screen versions of what I might of enjoyed as a child on Saturday tv. So in traditional Star wars fashion this movie set the scene with the scroll and off it went. Did I enjoy it? Yes very much so ! Was the acting good? Very much so? Was it well made? Yes excellent effects, soundtrack pure genius. Oh and did I enjoy it? Yess very much!!😁. A great Star Wars. Problem is that there are far too many people out that take this canon of films a little too seriously. I didn't have any issues with the story threads, in fact they all made sense to me. A lots been made of discarding the last Jedi storyline. I'm not a hardcore fan so may be lost on me but I thought it followed on nicely. As a later trilogy I think it stands up nicely. Go see it, forget real life for a couple of hours and enjoy!!",1
1918,1.0,It's as good as you can imagine a movie with horses riding on the outside of space ships in outer space. It makes no sense. It's what you get when you divide by zero. This movie was a complete disasterpiece. Perfect lead in for 2020. Just. Awful.,0
1919,10.0,"Okay, is not what I would call this film... Satisfying is definitely what I would call this film. IX or the ninth film in the Star Wars saga is brilliant, all the way through the story is action packed. It has scenes that will have you laughing and crying at the same time! There are parallels within this film that I'm sure true fans will definitely spot.<br /><br />This film also pays a lovely tribute to the late and great Carrie Fisher, which will definitely leave a lump in your throat.<br /><br />This film is satisfying, beyond perfection and a great way to end the saga.

Everything just works! The homages, the reveals, the humor, the chemistry between characters, but most importantly the story, which feels much more organic and intense than any of the previeous movies. Like the original trilogy it has that certain magic to it that is hard to describe, but which will suck you into the universe, the story and its characters. The visuals are stunning and memorable, the action is perfectly dosed - sometimes taking a backseat to the character development - and the overall story is both interesting, mysterious and gives us the answers we want, and those that will surprise us. The movie is perfectly paced. Never a boring minute. A perfect ending to a flawed third trilogy.",1

So much happens OFF SCREEN that you are left wondering why they didn't must make this a 2 part movie... I'm not even going to continue, its so bad its not worth spending any more of my energy on LOL.

This is even better! There were some plot things I would of changed but they still made sense in the scope of the film. Things I had been hoping for for years finally came true and also had unexpected twists and turns. It tied even small twists from Revenge of the Sith! It's a very controversial film and is centered around Rey so I can see where the nostalgic anti Rey fans get mad but who cares. Go see it, it's all about love.",1

The only things that are good about this movie are the visual effects and the acting for most of the main characters. Everything else is horrible if you have been following this story the whole way through as well as the expanded universe before it was disgracefully demoted to ""legends"". The best part about this movie is that this trilogy is finally over, but I think i'm going to stick with Return of the Jedi being the end to the Skywalker saga.",0

1952,8.0,"""StarWars - The Rise Of Skywalker"" may not be the best film in the ""Skywalker Saga"", but the film remains action packed throughout until its fittingly nostalgic final moments.<br /><br />.<br /><br />In this sci-fi adventure film, a year after the events of ""The Last Jedi"", the surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more in the final chapter of the Skywalker saga.<br /><br />.<br /><br />The ""Skywalker Saga"" will go down as the greatest film franchise of all time and that's why despite mixed reviews, this ending could not be more fitting and I enjoyed this conclusion. I did feel that the film felt rushed at some points, but there's so much going on to end it all. There's tons of action, laughs, revelations, twists, turns and trust me not one detail is left out. Did I mention nostalgia? Tons of it. For me, the ""Star Wars"" films were apart of my childhood. I remember seeing ""A New Hope"" when it was re-released in 1997 and I've seen every ""Star Wars"" film on the big screen since then. I could not think of a a better way to end an epic franchise. Don't get me wrong, it's not as great as ""The Force Awakens"" or ""The Last Jedi"", but if you grew up watching these films, ""The Rise Of Skywalker"" will definitely leave a mark on you.",1
1953,10.0,Movie wasn't a 10 but after Rian Johnson's disaster there is very little that could have been done to end the trilogy on a good note. Movie is a solid 8 all day!!!,0
1954,7.0,"The Rise of Skywalker was by far the best movie of the new sequel trilogy. I have a difficult time understanding certain reviews and the general rating of this movie. My recommendation is go and see it, it's the movie that while being imperfect and flawed in certain areas, redeems the sequel trilogy and brings a dignified end to the Skywalker Saga.",1
1955,1.0,Writers suck. Disney is ruining the franchise. I would be more detailed but I've already wasted enough of my time on this dumpster fire.,0
1956,10.0,"Best Star Wars since the originals, so damn epic I got to see in IMAX which was awesome! Everything I would want from a Star Wars film, amazing action, cinematography, heartwarming, and tearjerker aspects make for such a wonderful experience. I feel bad for anyone that didn't like this one cause I absolutely loved it. What's with the hate the movie was so great?!?!",1
1957,9.0,"I've watched this film twice and I cannot understand why it's rated the worse out of the 3 new ones. I just don't really see anything wrong with it. It ties the trilogy together, there are some nice touches to previous films. Definitely an improvement on the previous film and allows you to now go back and watch them all over",0
1958,1.0,"Space Balls was a better version of Star Wars than this abortion. Any and every person who was involved in green-lighting, writing, producing, directing, acting in, the freakin' costume designers, the puppeteers....the darn caterers, all of 'em should be run out of Hollywood with pitchforks. The only positive thing I can say is at least this travesty brings this shameful era to an end....or does it? DON DON DON",0
1959,8.0,"I don't understand why people rate this 1/10 or anything below 5/10 ? Sure not the best SW film . Sure it had it's drawbacks and mistakes and had some messy scenes . But honestly to me at least was far better than TFA and TLJ (btw I really liked TFA but i didn't like TLJ ) . It wrapped up the trilogy pretty good and had emotional tension as well as constant , powerful and satisfying action . That's my review of the film and I honestly believe JJ did a really great job with what he was given + he has great ideas .",1
1960,1.0,"And it's sad because Star Wars was made during the height of the Cold War, where we almost faced nuclear annihilation.",0
1961,3.0,"I love star wars, I can't say I liked this. I found it boring and predictable. There are so many holes in the plot it's annoying. Star destroyers that can't navigate up??? They have windows don't they??? I liked the force awakens as it was a nostalgia trip, last jedi was rubbish in my view and although this was marginally better it's still way off pace. I'm not anti Disney either, after all theyve given us the Mandalorian which is awesome. So I hope now this saga has closed we can start seeing so proper creative new star wars material of the same calibre as Rogue One and the Mandalorian.",0
1962,1.0,"I was shocked that J.J. Abrams could be this bad of a screenwriter. Then I watched a little movie he wrote called Gone Fishin'. Now I understand.<br /><br />(Screenwriter Chris Terrio deserves as much or more blame, he has written one bad movie after another.)",0
1963,5.0,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**,0
1964,10.0,After the last Jedi I think they were able to turn it around and did a great job overall with one movie left for the saga. I felt like there was closure and left a little bit of mystery for the future.,1
1965,4.0,"This movie is embarrassing. It is an insult to the memory of one of the greatest stories ever told by cinema all for the sake of a cash grab. Huge questions are left unanswered, previous character story arcs are ignored, decades of cannon are forgotten and to be honest it just doesn't tie in with the other movies in a way that makes sense..<br /><br />The film is visually stunning - in the same way a quality chef can make spam look good.",1
1966,5.0,"Here's the thing.. this movie has the action you would've thought but still having not real impact.. everyone is keep moving around planets with so many cuts and that made it feel so choppy, giving so much useless exposition that it felt so tiring and rushed, like they were trying to fit another movie into this one. There is fan service as you imagined but what's the point of that? To just say wow look at what they did there! At places it felt so cheap and unnecessary.",0
1967,1.0,"This movie is a disgrace to the star wars franchise. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece considering both the last jedi and the force awakens were pretty much unwatchable, but I managed to be twenty times more shocked and disgusted with this movie than I ever expected to be. I could have gone my entire life without that Kylo Ren makeout scene. Pretty sure the whole theater heard me gag. And while we're at it, let's discuss that Carrie Fisher tribute. Some tribute that was. Killing Leia off and having her vanish into mid-air? for what? So we can watch these mediocre, shallow characters that nobody cares about run around in circles fighting each other for five minutes and then hopping to the next planet to fight again and again and again? By the time the end credits started rolling, I felt like I was being put out of my misery. Real star wars fans know that this movie is nothing but a steaming pile of garbage. It doesn't feel like star wars anymore, if that makes sense. The prequels may not be the best movies ever made, but at least they have that classic star wars feel. This movie doesn't. The characters are dull. The saber battles suck. The dialogue is dreadful. The villain is useless. The twist is lame. The ending was the best part because that meant I was finally about to be free of the torture.",0
1968,4.0,"Uninspired, by the numbers, safe and familiar comfort food for Star Wars fans. It feels like a greatest hits of the OT played by a cover band. If you've seen the OT then you've sen this.",1
1969,3.0,So is Rey the CHOSEN one now? Is the palpatine family the 'chosen' bloodline of the force instead of the skywalkers?,0
1970,5.0,"Just out of the movie...Pointless... that's the only way I can describe it. It doesn't come close to any of the originals, and it's actually a bigger disappointment than Last Jedi. Disney please do not make anymore movies. As a fan of the original which I grew up loving, this trilogy is mediocre at best and just a redux version of the originals... stop cashing in,",0
1971,6.0,"Well acted, poorly written<br /><br />100 % predictable plot<br /><br />Amazing music, thanks again to sir John Williams<br /><br />Kylo once again the best of the movie<br /><br />Rey, unfortunately I never connected with her<br /><br />Fights, ok<br /><br />Leía, ok<br /><br />CGI, poor in general as usual, year behind marvel",0
1972,1.0,Unadulterated rubbish- complete waste of time and money !!,0
1973,3.0,This was billed as the big conclusion to a story I fell in love with back in 1977.<br /><br />I just couldn't believe by the end of this 2.5 hour 'trailer' (as one other reviewer wisely observed)...just how inconsequential this whole trilogy has turned out to be.<br /><br />This reminded me greatly of how disappointed I was after seeing Star Trek: Into Darkness. It has many of the same flaws but they're more painful this time due to the importance of this movie to the whole story of Star Wars. This is where it was all leading? Very very poor!,0
1974,4.0,"Lets get this out right away: Rise of Skywalker is not a disaster. Its actually a decent popcorn sci-fi movie and magnitudes better than Last Jedi; not that this is difficult to achieve, but still.",0
1975,4.0,"Yep it's true Rocky is back for another bout in the ring ... oh excuse me, I meant to say Elvis Presley. Yes, Elvis did die in 1977 but they can bring anyone back. They can keep this series going indefinitely, and I await Episode X, a decade from now where Elvis or Anakin or Rocky will fight the Sith somewhere in Afghanistan till they almost perish in the 'end'.",0
1976,7.0,"After The Last Jedi and Solo, I actually quit Star Wars. I'd had it.",0
1977,2.0,This movie is going at such break neck speeds in an attempt to hide how bad the writing is. JJ can't write the same movie he directs. It just doesn't work for him.,0
1978,1.0,Garbage when it comes to Star Wars standards. The ruined the franchise.,0
1979,1.0,"Star Wars is in ruins, and this film is a proof of that.",0
1980,3.0,Disney is so miserly cheap. They have a mountain of cash and instead of hiring good actors and actresses give us this bargain basement lot.<br /><br />Respect your audience and do not make any Star Wars-related films ever again. No one will watch them anyway.<br /><br />There is no 'rise' of anything here except Disney executive laughing at losers.,0
1981,1.0,"I really wanted to love this movie but there was just so much wrong with it I became unwatchable. I hoped when Disney bought the rights to this franchise we'd get something amazing.....We did, just not in the way I thought. Endor village is and will always be the end of the Skywalker saga.",1
1982,1.0,"George Lucas should be so saddened with how disney mess the legacy up.<br /><br />It's the kind of sell-out that destroyed the story.<br /><br />Such a sad end to the saga due to greed to stretch the story just to make money.<br /><br />In addition, the shameless recycling of plots, and the lack of anything new for the dark side is really disappointing. What a shame....",0
1983,10.0,"Wrecked!! Such an Amazing ending to an Amazing Saga. No spoilers, but absolutely loved the closer provided to so so many storylines. Can not wait to watch it more than once, I am sure that I missed many small details. Sat in amazement through out most of the movie, cheers from the audience, claps from the audience, and tears.",1
1984,5.0,Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope was the first movie I ever saw. So the franchise will always have a special place in my heart. I loved the first trilogy. Accepted the second. And I really wish they had never made the last trilogy. I can only hope in my heart of hearts that George Lucas has 3 unknown scripts that may be discovered one day and these last 3 movies will be redone the way they were supposed to be. No one can tell Star Wars like Lucas. Now maybe many of us that grew up with the Star Wars universe can put this series to bed and dream about what could have been that wasn't.,1
1985,10.0,"Don't look at these bad reviews, this movie is amazing and I loved everything about it. Loved seeing leia again. Loved seeing everyone. There were a lot of unexpected surprises that played a huge part of the film. The visuals were phenomenal. The acting and characters were great.",1
1986,2.0,"You may dress like Star Wars, have sets that are Star Wars. Put Star Wars in the tittle however this is not Star Wars",0
1987,2.0,"The Last Jedi never happen. Forget everything about it. No refunds. The GOAT without any training now trains nonstop. This obviously self- centered (female canine) neglects her responsibilities forcing the universe to suffer. Most importantly no one ever really dies. Do not believe any facts in this or any other film. Feelings rule. Beware the shameless amount of fan candy. It is to distract the most intelligent movie going base ever from this unoriginal, insulting, painfully predictable cliche. Rey appears to have gained twenty-plus despite multiple bindings. None the less, it does not slow her from single-handedly saving the very universe she placed in peril. That other stuff is just background noise. Moral: Rey is God. Two stars solely for John Williams.",0
1988,7.0,"Like many I grew up on the Star wars saga. As you get older the depth of the story comes forward more and you can compare it in every day life. There is the hero. There is the villain. There is the fight between the light and the darkness and there is the master and desciple relationship. There is the cool bar also but irrelevant for this text. Even some religious books have the same recipe. But this one is taking place in the Galaxy. And that is what the creators of the movie parts were trying to point out. We all have the same struggles. The good and the bad wolf. Which one to feed? Depending on the situation, no? When the knowledge is lacking darkness prevades and darkness can lure with powerful, shinny tools. That is why the element of a Master is needed to guide us to the light of wisdom. Master comes in different forms and mother and father are the first ones. I'm not sure why so much hate for all of these movies (except the first 3) when the story is at the core of the universal fight of good vs evil which exists everywhere around us and in all of us simultaneously. Why not just accept someone made something that is not how we expected and be adults about it. Renounce and enjoy said Mahatma Ghandi. For everyone else with open heart and mind just go, see and enjoy the ride. We should be thankful to everyone that participated in all these years, so much effort and love has been put into it and not cry about it. May the force be with you all.",1
1989,1.0,"Just don't lose your money watching this, its awful.",0
1990,7.0,"Not saying that it was a masterpiece, but still liked it pretty much! All these years, this movie tried to teach us something, and that's the fact that with hope and the power of being together, you can defeat the strongest. It taught us that even the bad characters have a heart.<br /><br />Beside these, the movie itself wasn't bad at all. The atmosphere, the music, the acting, and everything else was really good. The twist was also breathtaking...",1
1991,8.0,Of course every piece of the story has more or less been recycled from one of the other 8 movies - the good versus evil plot just does not allow more at some point of time. But the moment you accept it and don't dwell in the good old times it is one of the best movies in 2019. Lovable characters and a quite OK end of the Skywalker saga. Let's see if this was the last one with ray...,1
1992,5.0,Pretty much this whole movie was trying to clean up after the debacle that was the Last Jedi. It was an honest effort but there just wasn't enough time. After tying up TLJ lose ends It tried to establish Itself as it's own film and it felt very rushed.,0
1993,1.0,This film is a love letter to those who hated TLJ and it fails badly. It's a jumbled mess that leaves you feeling completely empty. 9 of 9 a huge swing and a miss. My Skywalker saga ends in the Endor village.,0
1994,7.0,Disney Had no Idea what they were doing ever since they released Force Awakens. There was no plan they just made up stuff along the way. Rise of Skywalker is entertaining and a visually impressing film but the movie is a mess. Nothing makes Sense and this movie really has no idea WHAT TO DO.<br /><br />C,0
1995,1.0,Episodes 7-9 should be deleted from all media formats. This movie isn't even worth torrenting and it feels like been robbed of 2.5 hours and want my £15 back.,0
1996,4.0,"The Rise of Skywalker felt more like a 2 and a half hour trailer than a movie. Every line of dialogue was snappy to the point of ridiculousness, and the movie made absolutely no attempts to follow the age-old guideline of showing rather than telling, opting instead to drop expository info dump after info dump, constantly disrespecting the viewer's ability to infer even the simplest pieces of information. There was no glue to ground the movie emotionally, and every scene felt more shoehorned than the last. It was as though a different person wrote each scene, with no attempts to tie them together or set up plot points in such a way that they would provide any sort of emotional impact. I left the theater not feeling sad or angry, but empty, and as a life long fan of Star Wars, that was the worst possible reaction I could have had to such a movie.",0
1997,10.0,"Wow. I can't help but wonder how it would have been different if George Lucas wrote this trilogy. But in my opinion, Disney has done a fantastic job. Having seen all the Star Wars movies, except for the animated Clone Wars, I thought this was the perfect ending to a beloved saga. Everything is resolved. Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia make appearances with Carrie Fisher's archive footage. You have to see it for yourself. 10/10",1
1998,1.0,"I gave it 1 due to excellent visuals. Really stunning in 3D.<br /><br />Other than that, I don't think there could be movie more lazily done. At this point Rey already not Mary Sue, but Jesus himself. The Force is about magic tricks and that's it. Midichlorians are not liked (and rightfully so), but healing wounds in seconds, bringing back from dead. It gets more ridiculous with evey minute. Next Lea who was actually a Jedi and died without any reason. I get that she died IRL but c'mon. I hoped to see more dark Rey, but all I got were a few seconds, which were more entertaining that normal Rey for two hours. The list could go on and on, but ending was disastrous. A guy who was actually Palpatine (which I could not say due to terrible makeup) drew something from protagonists (the 'force'?), became allpowerfull, electroduced the entire enemy fleet, but could not defeat Rey the second time because she just happens to point a lightsaber in front of herself, and this villain who build a fleet in a desert just blows himself with his own lightning. Not a glimpse of sadistic calculative nature of Palpatine. Generic villain who literally kills himself.",1
1999,7.0,"Not sure if it was their intention really.but I thought the return of Palpatine is very hilarious. They made him humorous as well as scary,and I thought that's a genius move. Saw it twice,and first time wasn't too sure,but 2nd time was pure gold. Ending is intense and had me in stitches. I've seen all Star Wars movies in the theaters,and yet I don't ever recall laughing so hard at an ending. It was great despite some cliches. I know I'm in the minority when I say it's the best one since Return of the Jedi! Great movie.",1
2000,4.0,"J.J Abrams having monumental pressure on his shoulders, to not only end a conflicting trilogy but to end a deeply beloved Saga, gives us the best movie that was possible in the given circumstances.",1
2001,9.0,"On one side, we have the ""Fandom Menace"" haters, who hate almost anything from the Disney Star Wars era. ""The Last Jedi"" is their mortal enemy, which is partially understandable. Last Jedi was a very good movie, but not a great Star Wars movie. It felt like Johnson was embarrassed by the franchise's history. BUT you can't let one film ruin your appreciation for the others. Move on!",1
2002,1.0,"My dad said 'if you haven't got anything good to say, say nothing'. So .......",0
2003,1.0,"Worst Star Wars movie ever😭 I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy, this was just pandering crap. It's apparent that Disney did not have a cohesive vision for these 3 movies... and WTF with that ending? (No spoilers but Ben was the best part of this movie and Disney ruined that by the end of it.) Rent do NOT pay for a movie ticket. There are only a handful of movies that didn't ""draw me into"" them where I wasn't able to forget that I was in a movie theater watching a movie.... This movie didn't draw me in at all. I found myself counting the minutes praying it would be over.",0
2004,6.0,Is the best movie of the trilogy but isn't like the george films. I think that is a good movie but not the greatest ending<br /><br />In resume is a good movie,1
2005,6.0,"Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker caps off the final instalment in the new trilogy and also marketed as capping off the Skywalker nine-film saga. The last point is left to be seen. Director J. J. Abrams had an enormous task at hand, which proved too formidable for him to handle. The final product was an incoherent mess that tried to do too many things with limited time and at the same time.",0
2006,2.0,"My son and I began watching this movie Wednesday night and finished watching it Thursday night. Not only is this a Star Wars movie, but it is the last movie of the saga...and it took us two days to watch it.",1
2007,3.0,"If you're a Star Wars fan and you were hoping this could save the nightmare these movies have been, sorry. I hate Ren, I hate how they destroyed who Luke and Han were and this is just a sad ending to my favorite story in American cinema.",0
2008,10.0,A really fantastic and well balanced ending to the trilogy as well as whole Skywalker saga. I was 10 years old when I watched EP4 for the first time (+50 times by now...) and as a serious Star Wars fan the saga has influenced my live in a positive way. I love EP9 and recommend it to anyone with an open and positive mind. Entertainment at it's best!,1
2009,5.0,"It was never going to be easy to finish off such a beloved franchise, and we only have to look at the final season of GOT to know that. In a similar turn of events, The Rise of Skywalker is ultimately let down by trying to cram too much content into the story. J.J. Abrams quickly jumps from idea to idea without giving enough time to reflect or be able to emotionally attach yourself to what's going on.<br /><br />.<br /><br />I'm no diehard Star Wars fan. I have always enjoyed the films, but they aren't religion. So this is where my point of view comes from. I really liked The Force Awakens (8/10) and LOVED Rogue One (9/10). The Last Jedi wasn't bad, but left me slightly underwhelmed (7/10). The Rise of Skywalker is the worst of the new films. The runtime of 2hrs 21 is no longer than the last two, but it feels it. It really feels long, and I put this down to hectic and clunky story telling.<br /><br />.<br /><br />In terms of performances, Daisy Ridley gives her best to date and Adam Driver is great! There's also some great action pieces, and a wonderful array of weird and interesting creatures to be seen, which you would expect.<br /><br />.<br /><br />I think the biggest thing to take away is there is nothing new here. It feels like the same story. It didn't have any wow moments. It really does feel like a Disney film. One that takes no risks, and tries to play to the crowd. The fan fare is so in your face, that it almost feels insulting. It just feels the same as Disney has been doing all year. Rehashing old favourites because they know people will pay to see them, good or bad. Unfortunately, in terms of quality this year, Disney seems to be having the Netflix effect. Quantity over quality.",1
2010,10.0,Okay so the plot of this movie is absolutley fantastic the story moves fast and theres plenty of action i had a gripe it would be lenth the movies way too long and there are slow parts so i suggest getting snacks but however this is quite a movie and i dont recommend taking kids due to the violence and again leinth but i say see it,1
2011,1.0,"I've read a lot of the old cannon books and watched the original so many times I've lost count. I hate the prequels, but I've enjoyed the latest trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker is full of inconsistencies, plot holes, and lazy writing. Having said that, I was absolutely thrilled with the movie. Mostly thanks to the actors, it had heart. The nods to the original cannon were a very nice touch throughout the film. The plot moved asking nicely without the annoyingly long tangents of The Last Jedi. Everyone in the theater was clapping at the end. I would love to give this movie a solid 8, but Disney forcing their agenda on everyone won't let me do that with a clear conscious. This will be the last Star Wars movie I ever pay to watch.",1
2012,4.0,"Look, I'm not an avid Star Wars fan. I grew up with this sequel trilogy and was introduced to the prequel and the original movies as a young kid. I do love the movies and consider myself a fan. To be honest, I think that this new trilogy was pretty terrible. Some scenes and moments were great, but it's no way comparable to the originals. I think it was a stupid idea from Disney to completely sideline George Lucas, the CREATOR of Star Wars, and think that they could replicate the same emotional and cultural impact the prior six episodes had on us. I mean, like I can't. These sequel films were just so derivative of the original three films. I know this is called ""Star Wars"", but honestly, it was just a bland, unorganized war story in space that had the literally the same villian, the same mastermind, the same forces (an order and a rebellion), etc. It was just the same story. What I cherished about the prequels is that it provided us with different, but relevant themes of good and evil, family, community, etc. It still had conflict, but it had some emotional weight. The sequels were none of that. It was just a copy of the original three like mentioned earlier. They introduce new characters that they never thoroughly develop and make them into the main characters of the story, while making the returning characters the center of the spotlight. I understand that they needed to conclude their storylines, but they're no longer the center of these movies. They had their time, they need to move on. It would've been better if they fleshed out the trio, made them likeable, but realistic and relatable characters, while having the old characters in the picture, but not having them as protagonists, and providing them with satisfying conclusions. But, they just added the new cast and old cast together, which makes them unable to develop anyone because now there is a ton of characters to account for. These movies had amazing effects, music, and great acting, but the writing, plot, and characterization extremely impacted the product. If I were Disney, I'd fire Kathleen Kennedy, bring someone extremely dedicated and familiar with Star Wars like Jon Favreau or Dave Filoni to become President, bring George Lucas back into the picture, and redo this trilogy because this was a disservice to Lucas' work. I hope that someone can bring this franchise back to prosperity.",0
2013,3.0,"The movie was all over the place, sort of non stop jumping from place to place for the first act. JJ tried to make sense of what Rian Johnson left off with and was not very successful.",0
2014,6.0,If you like fast paced video game style sequences then this might be enough for you.,0
2015,1.0,"I just feelt empty inside after watching this and after i left the cinema i got alot more questions in my head instead of geting answers for them, this 'movie' is just an party of nostalgia and nothing more and you get to follow a character you don't even care about and just is better than everyone on just everything with no explanation and it's just so sad...my star wars time is over, thanks disney for killing my childhood.",0
2016,9.0,"What an ending for a finale of the final trilogy for the Star Wars saga! Here, we see the return of the original characters including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, Lando Calrissian and Palpatine/Darth Sidious along with newer ones like Rey, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, Finn and Poe. There is never a dull moment with so many twists, surprises and cliffhangers from start to finish. Everyone acted well, and the visual effects were impressive. What a ride this has been, and now there is compelling need to watch the entire saga starting with The Phantom Menace. Let's roll!",1
2017,10.0,Luke finally formed a loving relationship with his sister and trained her the ways of the force and on a rainy nights they got too close. The problem only surfaced years latter when his nephew complete his training and read lukes mind tells his father Han and burned down luke's temple. Leia cover her tracks with this wizard of oz snoke and has her son kill Han for leaving her. Luke was so ashamed of himself he spent years living like a hermit. Leia then makes up with luke and they create palpatine and redeems themselves after Rey kills her and Ben gives up his life to save her. Problem sorted out. No one alive knows their secret except Rey who now knows she a skywalker. She then buried the two lightsabers of her parents and is seen talking to Ankins grandmother as she visits his house. Its like life of pie and most people will just not see whats infront of them. It goes back to new hope luke and han fighting over leia and luke was the winner.,1

I have never been this close to leaving, the only thing keeping me seated was the fact that I would have had to walk home.<br /><br />This movie has to be the most predictable one ever. Every event was obvious at least 10 minutes before it happened.<br /><br />They made a joke out of the Sith and Jedi by making them cry at least 70% of the time. And apparently dead Jedi can still interact with the living world (Luke grabs an X wing from under water). Why they don't just fight Palpatine is a riddle to me, they can't die anymore.<br /><br />Also, the political correctness is way too obvious and obnoxious.<br /><br />This was more Harry Potter than Star Wars with the weird magic stuff instead of Force stuff (granted the Force is some kind of magic but this is way out of tone with everything Star Wars related).<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this horrible end to a great francise. The Force Awakens gave me a little bit of hope but it just got worse.",0

2023,7.0,Forget the reviews and forget the critics and forget the upset fans who will never be satisfied look past it all and know that this is a finale for a new generation of fans. Comparisons to the original movies will always fall short. This movie is surprisingly better than expected.<br /><br />It starts well and the movie flows nicely tying up loose ends and stitching together differing stories. It brings in some missing parts from the first two movies and concludes well. Yes there are still some questions that need answering but there have always been unanswered questions throughout all 9 movies but to say it's doesn't bring the franchise to a fitting end is selling it short. It rounds off nicely and for me it was pleasantly better than expected.<br /><br />The standalone movies that are planned will no doubt fill in gaps as did rouge one for the original star wars trilogy so expect there to be cross references in the new planned yoda movie and rumoured 3 part obi wan movies.,1
2024,3.0,"If I had to write here everything that is wrong with this movie, this review would just be too long.

On the other hand it has nothing to do with the Star Wars universe, other than the names of the characters and the overall look.",0
2025,3.0,"No one is missing of the SW actors, why not trying to insert a scene with Rocky. There are so many scenario errors and obvious manipulation. The end is so full of them that you give up and want just to stand up and go after the next cliche or serrurections. If you succeed to stay until the end you regret and are irritated. The effects are well done, but maybe they are more star trek style than SW world I understand the concept of making money, but why killing the printing machine. Wait until you have a logical and coherent with SW world. This will be the SW movie missing in my collection.",0
2026,1.0,Well Disney completely bottled this one. The last jedi was awful but this somehow managed to be worse than that.,0
2027,7.0,"This film is not as good than any of the Star Wars Movie! The ending should have been better. I do enjoyed it but I don't like the ending of Rey Vs Palpatine. I just not that bothered and nah! I don't like the ending the way Rey called herself a Skywalker with Luke & Leia. It's Gould have been better. However, I do enjoyed some good bits like the Battle Of Exegol and Rey Vs Kylo Ren Lightsaber duel. The first half was a bit boring so far. This film is not perfect.",1
2028,8.0,My Review : Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker<br /><br />My Rating 8/10,0
2029,2.0,Not worth the franchise it's mediocre at best and one of the worst of the lot. The acting is abysmal the dialogue is like Swiss chess and the sword play is ???? Pathetic. So choreography is a no! Cast wow so so! & the rest is history thank... 2/10,0
2030,4.0,Worst movie of them all. A lot of ripoff of previous movies and major plotholes. Really hoped they could finish with a decent movie but we got this disappointing movie.,0
2031,8.0,I've never been a Star Wars geek but just taken each film as a story. I have seen them all on release at the cinema taking me from a 10 year old to 52. This isn't going to be a pros and cons review. I just want to say this is the first time since the first film back in 1977 that I haven't come away feeling slightly disappointed. Well done all involved.,1
2032,7.0,First of all i expected to more the movie is ok but not wow you know like the rest of the star wars movies<br /><br />Second-im my opinion the end was weak !!!!,0
2033,9.0,Great entertainment. Much better than expected and way better than the last one. Defo worth a watch for star wars and non star wars fans alike.,1
2034,8.0,"As a long time fan of the original trilogy, I hated the prequels. They had no story whatsoever and the characters weren't likeable at all. When The Force Awakens came out, I was reasonably satisfied because at least it wasn't as bad as the prequels. The Last Jedi however was a messy piece of feces. So I went into the theatre with mixed feelings. Will I like this last episode?",0
2035,6.0,"I enjoyed this better than the first 2, but the damage was already done in the previous instalments; especially TLJ.",1
2036,4.0,"** Summary **<br /><br />Terrible script. Actors and CGI are OK, but no amount of acting or CGI could have saved it. As a 40-ish Star Wars fan, I no longer feel engaged with the movie franchise. I feel more like Disney was banking on me watching this as I have watched all previous movies. Despite the terrible Last Jedi.",0
2037,10.0,I felt like I have to write a review for this film after watching it and that means something since this is my first written review on IMDB.,0
2038,8.0,"My expectations were low given the harsh reviews I had seen. However, it easily exceeded my low expectations and actually proved to be a phenomenal conclusion to the story. Sure, if you want to nerd out and hyper-criticize I'm sure you can find more than a few things wrong with it. I think people are too hard on this movie. J.J Abrams has created a new world of Star Wars and this movie fits well within it (and stays true to the original world). It also helps reconcile some of the disappointments of The Last Jedi for me. (I will say, 95% of Lando's parts were 100% cheesey- but I'm glad he made it into the film). Watch this movie.",1
2039,8.0,My non spoiler Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker thoughts: in given circumstances (Carrie Fisher's untimely death => improvised plot & raging fans) they did the best they could. My inner child is happy and was entertained. I am a proud fan and I got exactly what I expected. I understand that people who expected something else may be disappointed but I'm not. I give it 8 out of 10 and it may change on subsequent viewings :-),1
2040,1.0,The people involved in writing this crapfest ought to be fired and never let anywhere near a Star Wars film.,0
2041,9.0,"I thought the Force Awakens was ok. The last Jedi was horrible. A mess. It left the trilogy in shambles. Prank phone calls, emo Luke.. just bad.",0
2042,8.0,"I really enjoyed this film, but there are some scenes where it panders to the idiotic fans, who don't recognize what makes Star Wars great from the beginning.",1
2043,1.0,This sucks.,0
2044,5.0,"Before watching the movie, I saw some non-spoiler critics; they were mixed... some bad, some dramatically good. I went to see it for myself today. With the exception of Adam Driver and Daisy Ridely actuation, and 3 or 4 moving and key scenes, the rest of the movie seemed empty to me; very fast paced, poor dialog, lots of information packed fast mode... Some elements without logic... It seemed like a bunch of movie pieces without coherence ... Like if the movie was made in a rush, without the care, without a good pace, without meaningful moments that better projected a storye where the characters closed their roles properly, either expected or unexpectedly. The first 2 movies of this trilogy, were better indeed for my taste. Even when the firs one (The Force Awareness) picked some repeating elements of chapters IV and V, all movies kept the Star Wars spirit and Soul, This one, lacks the essence, the emotion that I used to feel in ALL previous movies, pre, and post Disney. I recall that in an interview, Laurecnce Kasdan mentioned tha J.J. Abrahms tended to complicate things unnecessarily; indeed, it happened here, in a messed up, bad way. Love the franchise; this is not a good way to close it.",0
2045,2.0,"My goodness this movie was a struggle; something to be endured cheerlessly and seemingly endlessly. Looking back on it, I'm struggling to remember what happened in the first half other than Adam Driver gurning as an alternative to emoting and Daisy Ridley keeping her pyjamas impressively clean as she clambered over and on to various very dirty things.",0
2046,4.0,The Rise of Skywalker? More like The Failure of Disney.,0
2047,1.0,"Last Jedi was bad but this was much much worse. Storyline basically destroyed all the previous movie lore and basically means everything done episode 1 to 6 was pointless and meant nothing. Well done Disney, you actually killed it this time",0
2048,2.0,I will admit I have been pretty put off by The Last Jedi for the last couple of years. I went into the theater with somewhat of a bad attitude but as a minutes went by I really started enjoying this movie. After I left I could honestly say this was a great movie considering how much damage control it had to do after Ryan Johnson's whole mess. I will say that this movie would have been a lot better if it didn't have to compensate for the mistakes of The Last Jedi but all of these one or two star reviews are a little cynical and a little much I think. You can kind of compare Star Wars Canon has become almost a religion too many people figuratively speaking of course but because there's such a high standard put up in everybody's mind it's very hard to put together something that everybody is going to love. I will say The Last Jedi was legitimately a bad movie but this film really makes up for that mistake. If you haven't seen this movie quite yet stop reading the reviews from cynical Star Wars nerds and just go judge it for yourself. I think they wrapped this up the best they could and I think they did a good job.,0
2049,2.0,"Possibly the worst film of the year considering it's heritage and long standing legacy. Admittedly JJ was severely backed up into a corner by the horrendous The Last Jedi, but what he ultimately come up with is nothing short of a travesty. I really don't think I could ever return to this film after the first watch and on a whole, this entire Disney trilogy of films are absolutely shocking in their execution. Rise Of Skywalker is not thrilling, head banging exposition, messy storylines to retcon what came before it. Rey is the ultimate Disney Princess with superpowers beyond measure and all of her feats are just eye rolling and ridiculous as the film progresses through from one boring scene to the next. ""Master Leia"", give me a break. Even that backstory crowbarred in there is not palpable in the slightest, and besting Luke in a lightsaber duel putting him on the deck (again) to give credence to her training of Rey was pure cringe. Beside, the cringe on offer here was at maximum levels like you can't believe and take serious for a moment. The nods to old sights and sounds of original Star Wars films only remind you of indeed, better Star Wars films of the past. In closing it is a complete ripoff of Return Of The Jedi and Rise Of Skywalker will only be remembered for hammering in the final nails of this once beloved franchise that now lies in ruins by Kathleen Kennedy's insidious agendas at work here. I do not recommend this film at all.",0
2050,2.0,Well The Last Jedi left me feeling angry and upset with the treatment of original characters. This one was just devoid of any feeling at all. Truly a sad day for Star Wars fans everywhere.,1
2051,3.0,"As a huge Star Wars fan, it was a disapointment to see as Disney totally focused on making money with the franchise instead of providing a quality, inovative and most wanted sequel to the original movies. It seems they started a new trilogy without having any ideia about what the story should accomplish. The 3 movies were disconnected from each other and a stupid repetition from what has already been done. The dialogue was childish and the plot was hard to swallow, simply not convincent. They had such a rich material from the universe of Star Wars and they chose to throw it all in the trash. Such a careless work on a much beloved franchise make me hate Disney for spending my money to see they destroy what was so inovative for its time. The last movie is the worst of the 3, with plots created out of the blue, poor conversation and not buyable story. I still prefer phantom menace with its Jar Jar ridiculous character and a dipers ace fighter pilot anakin than the 3 movies together. At least Lucas tried to do something new with the prequel.",0
2052,3.0,"Bin this film and the previous two for their new cast of pointless, unlikeable characters. And for horrid, horrid writing. And for some questionable acting. And for pervasive, general stupidity that must be rampant in the offices where decisions were made while producing this movie. How could anyone screw Star Wars up this badly?",0
2053,8.0,"My expectations for this film were quite low and I thought that I would be writing something like: ""A forgettable series with forgettable characters comes to a forgettable end"" for the third film in this trilogy. Early on, things weren't tracking well, as far as my score went, as I found the action uninvolving and the comedy not grabbing me, such as when Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) and Poe (played by Oscar Isaac) were bickering early on in the film. To be fair, though, in retrospect the 'banter' between Han Solo and Princess Leia in Episode V, especially, I think, wasn't that great...when viewed again as someone who is no longer a pre-teen. Engaging banter isn't a strength of George Lucas, as it is for, say, Joss Whedon (e.g. the ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" TV series).",1
2054,10.0,"I agree that the movie could've been better. But after the TLJ there wasn't much to picked up. The movie felt rushed. And I feel that this one shoul've been the secuel or they should've make another movie and make 4 movies instead of a trilogy and break the tradition after the failed of the TLJ. However, the movie was amazing and it made me cried a lot. It has some plot holes but it's the last movie and it has a cute ending.",0
2055,8.0,"I know many diehard fans disliked this movie. I am not one of those people, but I thought it was a good movie. It was a bit too long as almost all Star Wars movies are, but I thought it had a good pacing and was fun to watch. I know it might be a controversial take. It's not the best movie ever by any means, but I liked it.",1
2056,1.0,"This film is proof of how a trilogy should not be made. a series of three films, one uglier than the other, for me it all ends with the sixth episode. this is only marketing and it is a film made by a corporation, it is not cinema. have completely dismantled my childhood.",1
2057,2.0,We did this!,0
2058,10.0,"This movie was just amazing, I loved the visuals they felt so real. The music was just great and it fit in every scene. I also love the acting. Everything was just so beautiful.",1
2059,1.0,Jar Jar Abrams officially ruined Star Wars. If the Green Lantern movie and Phantom Menace had a child. At least Chewbacca got his medal. As a prequel fan I must say to hell with Reylo. To hell with canon. So glad Mando exists.,0
2060,10.0,"I know Star Wars through it's influence in popculure and I watched episode I when i was 10. From the moment i saw young Anakin do some podracing, i know i will love this universe. And here i am, episode IX, the saga ended but with The Mandalorian which is doing great so far, Star Wars still alive. It had become something more than just a franchise, something that so deerly to our heart. As for episode IX, a great way to end the saga and for what's happening, i just couldn't see a better way to end this.",1
2061,3.0,"It is such a nonsensical and stupid part... i just want to forget whole disney's trilogy. it was created for money making, not for story making. I just imagine that it was nightmare of Luke or Solo. They are still alive. just a bad dream. just a dream....",0
2062,1.0,You will know the end... Disney made this movie just to make money,0
2063,1.0,Storyline was a mess. Main characters were pointless. Confusing and anticlimax ending.,0
2064,3.0,"My impressions: meh, formulaic, predictable, posers, wannabes, deus ex machinas throughout, especially with its christmas present wrapped happy ending aimed at the pre-teen demo. So, yeh, BIG disappointment to the conclusion of the first ever cinematic trilogy-of-trilogies spread over 40+ years. What should've been a lifetime of fantasticosity peters out in a bland, seen-it-before shadow of its original trilogy self. JJ Abrams should NOT be proud of this.",0
2065,1.0,This is the worst film in Star Wars universe.,0
2066,1.0,"It had so much potential. I was actually excited and relieved at some point in the movie. It was going in an unexpected and original direction, a direction I could actually feel good about.<br /><br />And then it all BOMBED in the end.<br /><br />Just garbage!<br /><br />Definitely unworthy of being a part of the SW universe.<br /><br />All 3 movies are just garbage now.<br /><br />So disappointing.",0
2067,,"I hated every minute of it. The terrible writing, the unwanted comic relief, and the desire to want to be demographically correct. Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams took a steaming hot s*** all over these past 3 movies. Never forget the time Rian Johnson said Empire was bad. As with most things, Disney has ruined Star Wars.",0
2068,2.0,"Honestly it had it all Great soundtrack, visually stunning, descent actors. The only thing lacking was a believable story. It was like Bobby from Dallas in the shower all over again. What waste of time and money. What a shame",0
2069,4.0,Not up to the mark. It is quite boring. Story was not gripping.,0
2070,1.0,"First off, I appreciate everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but anything above a 5 for this film is total nonsense from people who are not real star wars fans or dont appreciate/understand the basics of film making. I guess you can give it a few stars due to visuals but for me, its a zero to be honest.",1
2071,10.0,"I enjoyed the movie but I think a better ending would have been for Rey to willingly kill Palpetine, then become the Empress and destroy the Rebels, the Darkside then taking control of the universe, now that would have been a nice talking point for all the haters lol....",1

2076,1.0,"Obviously, it wasn't 1/10 movie but 10/10 reviews from Disney bots are popping up everywhere so we need to adjust for this madness. Also I think this should be scored as a trilogy, not a single movie. That being said, oh boy, what a mess of a movie it was. Let's go over some points:",0

2079,7.0,"In 1977, I waited more than a month to see Star Wars. It was playing only in theater where I lived and it was sold out constantly for weeks. When I finally saw it was incredible. I had never been as excited after seeing a movie. The Star Wars saga will always have a place in my heart. I truly love it. I am not a Star Wars geek per se. I dont obsess over the most minuscule details such as names of obscure characters in the universe but no other films mesmerized me as much as the original trilogy. To this day there is NOTHING that I love more than being in a packed theater and seeing ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" and Star Wars blast into the screen with the music by John Williams. I get chills.",1

I got the opportunity to see this film premiere early in toronto and I remember walking out of the theater feeling anger and disappointment. There was to much going on for me to care about, the characters were still as bland as ever, the action was disappointing and dull and boring, while all of the mistakes from the previous movie, the last Jedi, found its way into this flick. This was a disappointing end to a once beloved movie series.",0
2083,4.0,"What happened? How did we get to this point? And although I think Disney definitely had something to do with the problem, you can't put it all on Disney. There's plenty of blame to go around.",1
2084,8.0,"I swore off the franchise after the Last Jedi, and judging from the turn-out for Solo, so did many other fans. Fortunately, JJ Abrams managed to come in and salvage the trilogy with this final installment, although that doesn't let him off the hook for the first movie.",1
2085,10.0,"SUPER loved this movie. I was 13 years old, voted in Tiger Beat's contest (should Princess Leia end up with Luke or Han), and loved Luke. I saw this movie 13 times - which is a lot for 1978. Luke has always been my favorite character. I've watched the original trilogy more times than imaginable. My own children grew up with the prequels and the animated series, so I know Star Wars. I'm not a 'fly by' fan. The Force Awakes - wow! The gasp of the murder of Han Solo in the theater was like a scream when so many did it at once. I was SO happy to see The Last Jedi, hoping to have answers to so many questions from the first...who was Rey? What happened to Phasma? What was Luke going to do? I waited through the WHOLE first movie to see Luke for two seconds so I was thrilled to learn what had happened. BUT - OMG - The Last Jedi didn't answer anything like I suspected. Evil Snoke was gone in a flash. Phasma, who? Rey is no one. Let alone the idea of poor Princess Leia turning into Mary Poppins...especially since she passed away! WHY didn't he change that scene??? Who would do that??!! SO - I was hoping Finn would wake from a 'dream' of the horror of the last film, when The Rise of Skywalker opens. I hated the second film in this trilogy so much that I don't own it. I own every bit of movie/animated series out there. I happen to really like Solo. I think it suffered coming out so near that horrible film. I loved how the leads had Han and Lando's mannerisms ... how we had a back story on favorite characters. SO - fingers crossed - we went to see The Rise of Skywalker at 6pm on Thursday - the night of opening. YES! It tried so hard to wrap up all of those mistakes from the last film. Rey, Poe, and Finn - along with the droids and Chewy - THAT's what was missing from the second movie! I loved the 'feel' of the film. It was so Star Wars! It dealt with the death of Carrie Fisher in a respectable way. It brought up a kite fair celebration that happens only every 42 years - I counted in my head - YES!! That's the original Star Wars date!! YAY!! There are so many WOW moments in this film. So many times to break out in claps. I SUPER loved this movie!",1
2086,10.0,Worth it. Im going to see it again. Don't listen to the haters. Go in with an open mind and the understanding that this is the end of the trilogy of trilogies. It really does fit nice together with the overall arc,1
2087,1.0,"Overall, I think it was the best of the new trilogy but it still sucked. Whether you've seen it or not, you know Palpatine is back from the trailer and movie(for those that watched it)... I just feel he shouldn't have come back. There was just no way he survived that defeat in episode 6. I feel JJ and Disney knew they had to do something to get us to want to watch it because of how terrible the new trilogy has been... so they brought back palpatine. I guess I'm just sick of seeing death stars being the target(became target in E7) and palpatine being the target.",1
2088,,This was the second movie in my 5 decades on this planet that was so bad that I simply could not sit the theater any longer.,0
2089,7.0,"Because I watched all the movies, I had to watch this. I liked the last film in the second series. I liked the last film in this series. Of course, the first trilogy is separate :)",1
2090,1.0,"And by that I mean - went down in horrible flames. How did I knew it would come to this the moment I heard about it? Because Disney doesn't care about story. They aren't creators who have the deep need within to put on screen things very dear and special to them. Disney are people who have a deep and special need for money and financial success and they would ruin and walk over anything that stands in their way. It shouldn't be possible to guarantee financial success by buying out proven stories and franchises that audiences love again and again. Yet this is Disney's favorite modus operandi that works. Even now they are sharpening their teeth for the next story or characters that the audiences will love, so they can buy the rights and squeeze money out of it.<br /><br />This movie, had all the charm of a 60 year old hooker, all dressed up in the finest extravagant clothing, expensive makeup and perfume, which couldn't hide her wrinkled skin and horrible street personality. I spent the entire movie being annoyed, shaking my head in disbelief how can someone fail basic story-telling tropes. This movie was filmed like a trailer - one flashy scene after another, which is somehow supposed to make it amazing, and maybe it does look amazing if you are a five year old kid. But great movies aren't made by flashy CGI overburdened scenes. Great movies are made by story and emotion. Emotion was noticeably missing from this CGI fiasco. I feel sorry for John Williams. It was so obvious that he struggled to create anything beautiful for this so the only moments where the music is noticeable is where he uses his old Star Wars motifs.<br /><br />In short - this movie is a cinematic abomination. A carnival ride of mediocrity, that leaves a stale taste in your mouth and shakes your belief in the power of story-making. Just one great shameful experience for everyone involved.",1
2091,5.0,"I am 49 and saw the original SW in the theater. I think I know my SW by now and this movie is not it. Since Jar Jar to this, please stop making them. Solo and Rouge One were good. These last two are not. And whey the lesbian kiss ? Not a good look.",1

When the prologue text rolled and seeing the phrase ""Supreme Leader Kylo Ren"", I chuckled. The first 2 sequel trilogy movies are not where one would like to learn about leadership, the least of all Kylo Ren. I do realize that J.J.Abrams had a huge challenge in patching up the debacle that Rian Johnson left hims, nothing more symbolic than the Kylo Ren's smashed helmet which was patched together yet with the apparent red cracks. This movie was like that helmet.",1

Rey just discovered her true powers and is able to kill the most powerful Sith lord in 30 seconds? No anakin appearances, since he was confirmed to be the 'chosen one'? I guess all it takes is TWO lightsabers and then you can defeat an almighty Sith Lord. Why does Luke care about rey throwing the saber into the fire when he threw his in the ocean? General Grievous put up a better fight than Palpatine did. C3PO's death was totally shrouded by lame humor and took away from his 'death' scene. Seriously had people laughing while his memory was erased. And to top it all off, the sworn enemies Kylo Ren and Rey turn to lovers at the end, cmon. I guess this is what I should expect from Disney taking over.",1

It has a good start but after the first 30 minutes the movie became boring and predictable.

The whole movie needed a trilogy. It was nice how they did Leia and explain Reys back story but they just put it out there suddenly. I don't see a problem with Rey being powerful even though her parents are not even strong with the force because just look at Anakin but the whole force law in this movie makes no sense making me confused about previous ones.

2141,1.0,"I wanted this movie to be good so badly but not only was I disappointed, I could barely sit through this monstrosity of a movie. The plot for the heroes was just them trying to find an object, to find another object, to find the emperor. And the whole knife thing was stupid. The grooves on the knife happen to line up with the deathstar and Rey happens to be standing in the correct spot to see it, and the points that it lines up with happens to not have changed over all those years...? and this film furthered the point that Finn had absolutely no worth in this whole trilogy. The knights of Ren were built up to be these awesome guys and everyone was hype for them and then they did absolutely nothing and they were trash. Chewbacca was ""killed"" off just to come back in the next scene (like ok...? what was the point), and Hux being a traitor made no sense. Bringing back the emperor was so dumb, and then making Rey a Palpatine just made it worse. How did the emperor manage to build that massive freaking fleet AND get huge amounts of people for crews on them all. And why did they build one device on top of one of the ships that could bring them all down. Rose basically wasn't in this movie. They erased C3PO's mind just to undo it later. They rode freaking horses on top of a star destroyer which was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Horses riding on the star destroyer and beating the empires weaponry? yeah no way. But the force healing was the stupidest thing they incorporated in that movie. Except for maybe the random force teleportation crap that made no sense. There was nothing good from the plot, the dialogue was terrible, and somehow they weren't able to make any of the characters likable. And nothing in this film can be redeemed, like how people are like even though the Last Jedi (although boring) had a more believable plot and at least it had great cinematography. I actually despise this movie and get angry when I watch it.",0

2147,4.0,"*spoilers---Overall this movie was decent. It moves almost too quickly and lacks much needed pauses in between all the action. There's a lot going on in a short amount of time. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's acting has been the best part of this entire trilogy, and it continues in this movie without a doubt. Their character's relationship is the only thing grounding and giving this story emotion and meaning. That being said, JJ royally screws over Ben Solo. He receives redemption, finally is happy with Rey and they get what looks like is going to be a happy life together. His dies in like 2 seconds, disappears, and Rey doesn't even mourn/act sad before the scene cuts to the Rebels partying and then Ben is never mentioned again. Like what?? He gave his life to Rey, they kiss, and he dies and she just goes on like nothing ever happened. Their relationship has been central to this trilogy and that's how it's ended? She doesn't even cry. Just jumps in the x-wing and leaves. JJ finishes off the saga with all the Skywalkers dead and Rey all alone. That makes no sense.",0

I love this franchise and I love (for the most part) the first 2 movies in the new trilogy. How we got to this point in terms of behind the scenes issues or lack of planning on Disney's part ultimately doesn't matter, this movie is an absolute blast. Tons of fist pumping moments, surprises, and more than anything a satisfying ending to a 9 picture saga.

2153,2.0,"This movie reminds me of a speech given by a child on a topic that they don't care about or understand for a school assignment. They have nothing to say about the topic really, but they know all the features that need to be in the speech to earn a passing grade. It's like JJ Abrams just went down a list of things that had to be in the movie rather than finding an interesting story to tell with good dialogue. I'm not really sure I blame him or Disney, they are in the business to make money and I'm sure they made plenty with this. Is this just a shameless corporate grab? Of course, but why take a chance with pissing off fans with something original when you can play it safe and make a bundle? The Star Wars movies have a fan base that is very loyal and as long as you give them the all the features they require, it doesn't seem to matter if it adds up to a nonsensical and boring mess. Hey, I'm not a ""hater"", I just can't overlook the fact that this is a bad movie. It was somewhat cathartic to read the negative reviews here because everyone I know who saw this movie seemed to like it. So, although I rented it with low expectations (because I have seen the other movies in this series) I didn't expect it to be awful. So, what makes it bad? Well it's bad because it's not good. Ha! Case closed! The original Star Wars was good because it was funny and had great characters that you really liked and cared about. The special effects were amazing for the time, but it had the confidence to slow down and have small moments. It had Harrison Ford in his prime. The only character I liked in this movie was the little robot mechanic on loan from a Men in Black movie. While I can remember a few scenes from this movie, I don't remember any that were particularly good. I wanted every scene with Kylo Ren to be over before it started. I really like Adam Driver, but watching him stomp around just wasn't very interesting. The Rise of Skywalker takes itself too seriously and really lacked humor, which I think is deadly with this kind of movie.

2157,3.0,"I give it three stars, one for having amazing cinematography, another for having an amazing score, and a third for placing the middle finger on the Last Jedi. It's not the worst film, that Honour goes to Cuties, but won't talk about it here. I don't think it is as bad as the Last Jedi, but with that being said, stay away from this film, as it completely makes Anakins sacrifice pointless and creates many more questions. How did Emperor Palpatine survive being thrown out, on top of being exploded on top of being trapped in space? Where on earth did General Hux become on the side of the resistance when there was no foreshadowing of any kind? This movie has just created way more questions than it has answered. Also, how is Poe shocked that stormtroopers have jet packs, after seeing lightsabers droids and other stuff? It also rips off the Return of the Jedi in several ways. Kylo Ren is redeemed, and saves himself from Rey like Vader was to Luke respectively, the order manages to defeat the order, and so much more. Rose and Mazz (however you're supposed to spell her name glasses green) are just standing there doing nothing important, C3PO and that annoying robot side kick are idiots who don't do anything funny, even Palpatine, is a joke despite being the main villain. Leia dies without any foreshadowing and for no reason. If you're looking to watch the original trilogy Star Wars and somehow never watched it, then by all means go right ahead it's fantastic. Heck, go watch the clone wars cartoon and the mandalorian and maybe revenge of the site. But whatever you do, DO NOT watch this film and especially do not watch the Last Jedi, this trilogy doesn't even deserve the Star Wars name. If you want to watch a film from last year because you're stuck at home right now, watch the Avengers endgame, if you have seen that watch Jumanji the next level or knives out. Jumanji the next level is not an amazing film, but it's a million times better than this garbage, as it did not destroy many years of Star Wars. Some people are calling this amazing and we're all being too harsh on this film, no I think we are being correct, none of the other Star Wars films in the original and prequel trilogy were anywhere near this awful. Stay away from this awful film and watch Jumanji the next level or knives out instead.",0

2161,8.0,"Well, what a lot of fuss about nothing much. I think Bambi just got shot all over again, folks, judging by the more extreme perspectives on RoS. I mean come on, it's entertainment, not an actual religion. A lot of people really need to go and get a life, because they've obviously got way too much time on their hands.<br /><br />Okay, my tuppence happeny's worth (not that anyone probably cares for a balanced opinion nowadays)...... Rise of Skywalker is good light entertainment. It sometimes thinks it's weightier than it actually is (a pointless nod to the preciousness of the franchise), and the plotting/storyboarding is fairly weak. It does rather smack of the ""How are we going to finish off the franchise, guys?"" question having been posed at the end of Ep VIII, post-production. Having said that, the characterisation is consistent with the previous films, the effects and action sequences are of a very high standard, the acting is decent and, the story is finished off quite neatly within the framework of RoS itself. Some story ideas do feel like they were developed through the last three films (Rey's origins, the malign influence of the Emperor in the background), though I suspect that was an illusion created by the kind of open-ended planning which features heavily in TV shows these days; JJ Abrams has plenty of experience in that regard.<br /><br />If there was no such thing as the Star Wars franchise, I'd have watched RoS and thought to myself ""the story could've used some work, it was confusing at times, but fine entertainment and top sci-fi action all the same.

Pros: Good action, good special effects for the most part, good acting for the most part, and lots of unnecessary but fun fan service. Also some of the characters decisions are mostly good especially for Kylo Ren and C-3PO. Also the banter between the team was pretty good and fun. I also liked that Lando finally returned to the series though he is in it for only a short amount of time. The movie does do a good a job at making you nostalgic for the original trilogy and there are super really cool and exciting lightsaber fights.<br /><br />Cons: Palpatine's return was not needed, the movie retcons too much stuff that happens in the other movies, Finn should have been given more character development, the new characters were unnecessary and for the most part had no development , and the reveal of Rey's parents was fine but the reveal kind came out of nowhere. Also some of the humor just fell flat and felt out of place.The movie has a lot have things going on at times and this can drag the movie on and make it feel rushed.

2165,4.0,"Star Wars Review Time! (No Spoilers)<br /><br />Rise of Skywalker midnight screening complete. This film only demonstrates the disorganisation of Disney as they attempt to backpedal after The Last Jedi. Not only is the film unoriginal, but I'd go so far as to call it bland fan fiction. The plot holes are so obvious it literally hurts to watch. Star Wars is about the Skywalker bloodline, and more importantly the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker bringing balance to the force. The conclusion of the ""Skywalker Saga"" solidifies itself as anything but the story of the Skywalkers, but rather the story of a girl who got everything and didn't have to work for it. Poor writing, poor character development, and a story completely laden with ""progressive politics"" undeniably indicates that the core plot of Star Wars has been crushed under Disney. I forecast potential layoffs at Disney/Lucasfilm over this 3rd failed outing (The Last Jedi and Solo being 1 and 2 respectively). If you don't watch Star Wars for the story, then enjoy. But if you're a fan who's read into the lore, then I'm sorry, you won't be pleased. I suggest you save your money and make a statement to Disney that you won't accept this level of quality.",0

He definitely doesn't suck at it he knows his way around setting a scene.<br /><br />He has only really from what i can find directed 7ish movies or maybe it was 8.<br /><br />But he has helped produce a bunch of movies otherwise. So he is good at organising film production, going trough scripts and writing to put it together.<br /><br />But looking at the pattern he rarely works outside the box. He makes safe predictable clichés with poor plot but yummy scenes and scenarios that show grandiose potential. Which is why continuations in his works are rarely anything good.<br /><br />I think he would make great B-films and mysterious tv-shows. Super 8 is a good example of what he makes best.<br /><br />Star Wars is sadly where he is at his weakest. That big of a stage with that many moving pieces is not his thing. He works with a mysterious box but never shows the content. Star Wars is all about opening that box and looking inside.<br /><br />It's like with Rian Johnson i bet he can make a decent stand alone movie but he is not experienced enough to take on big titles with already ongoing plot lines. ""Last Jedi"" was oh crap i don't dare do anything with the story beyond what is already said to be okay. While again we can see that JJ is just copying George's already superior first trilogy work into his own safe ""nostalgia trip"" without really working outside the box because that might not sell. :/",0

2179,1.0,"Some spoilers!<br /><br />I can't say I enjoyed the last Jedi and I thought that the force awakens was a rip off of the original Star Wars but this film was the first to make me truly grumpy. As ever Adam Driver was the most interesting character and the most watchable, in Jedi I was rooting for the dark side and found Rey mostly irritating and the other characters of Finn and Poe superfluous. In this film there were even more characters added for no benefit and like Jedi we once again jump around the galaxy in a strange journey to find something important that ends up not being necessary and by the end Rey is the most annoying angry female character who apparently only alone can conquer all evil all the while the film discussed togetherness. Where is the storytelling what has happened to real movies? Delivered by committee it's as if a beginning and an end was discussed and the idea of how to get to the end was just to throw in a lot of stuffing as if we are all too stupid to understand anything complex. Definitely can see that also it was a film that waged war with the previous film, what a spiteful thing to do, a more generous Director would have built on the past and made it work harder. All in all disappointing, Mark Hamill was right better to leave to watching on cable.",0

2195,6.0,"Well, this is certainly a disappointing ending to the new trilogy but a charming ending to the end of the Skywalker saga. I am impressed with how J. J Abrams managed to switch back to the vision he first foresaw for this new trilogy. This movie is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is great and the cast is great too. Other than that, the movie's plot is well meh and the reveal of Rey's history is also dubious as it is kinda forced due to the fact that Rian Johnson changed stuff in The Last Jedi. I could sit here and complain about this movie and its various flaws as honestly this is a pretty bad ending for this trilogy. I believe that it is the high table's fault or whoever that is in charge of the whole new trilogy where they decided that it would be a fantastic idea to write the story as they go and not with an end goal in mind before The Force Awakens was even out. You can clearly see the dividing vision between J. J Abrams and Rian Johnson and I don't hate The Last Jedi it certainly is a bold movie in terms of a movie but as part of a movie franchise, it doesn't really work. But hey, if you've followed this saga since The Phantom Menace all the way to The Last Jedi, you'll be happy with this movie or well at least satisfied as it hits you with nostalgia and etc but if you came for the new trilogy ok, well it's okay. It is an okay movie, nothing spectacular. And if you hated The Last Jedi, well I'll call this movie a spit in Rian Johnson's movie and vision as it is mainly the clearing up of the collateral damage done in the previous movie.",0

As a result it loses many key things to make a good movie, suspens beeing one of them. Sympathy for the character is another, you can't relate to them since you haven't followed their journey in a sensible manner their reactions to events falls short, cause of the speed which in many ways distance/dehumanize them for you to understand them. As a last resort, The Rise of Skywalker tries to create emotion by using nostalgia which can be powerfull, done in a reasonable fashion, not just by throwing it in your face every time possible.<br /><br />At the end, this movie is more often than rarely incomprehensible,flat, emotionless, what is a movie that doesnt tell a saga you can understand...Not Star Wars merely pictures, beautiful pictures...",0

Even until today, Disney couldn't tell me why/where the stupid first order comes from.<br /><br />Because of this lack of a believable, living or interesting universe they build up in this 3 films, there isn't anything they could build up for me as a consumer.

This movie is a improvement compared to last two with (smoke), I mean Snoke who was or was not a clone and it seemed Palpatine had tanks full of snorke's .

There's also a need of a satnav, pyramid to find a sith planet. They bring back the brother sister kissing from New hope this time Rey and her brother Ben (Nice).

It never ceases to amaze me how the pivotal final chapter of the franchise that changed Hollywood could turn out to be a 2 hour and 22 minute slice of bloated mediocrity.

For every single retcon of the much-maligned ""The Last Jedi"" to get the fans back on their side, there is an equally forced plot point that seems to have been put in there to divide everyone again.

The main problem is that this is the last movie in an ill-conceived trilogy. They had no plan, and the whole story was based on the original premise that two kids go looking for Luke Skywalker to return his ESB lightsaber that they somehow found.

Then there is Ren, who is so aggravated throughout the movie that it's hard to believe that the dark force doesn't just sweep her away seven times over. And then there is this ludicrous thing about three resistance fighters storming through a battle ship filled to the brim with storm troopers, shooting them right and left and front and back, from the hip and into the hip - without ever catching a bullet (sorry, laser) themselves.

2260,9.0,"After seeing the movie Thursday night, I felt JJ did a good job with the challenge he had. The movie was very entertaining and honestly felt more like a Star Wars movie than the last one. I think the critics rated this one dead wrong. I think this is a good solid Star Wars movie - definitely the best in the trilogy.",1
2261,8.0,"But this movie was for me. I believe it has the most well-written script, with countless, deliberate, fresh one-liners and punch-lines. But those were never in previous Star Wars, films, right? And a very sophisticated plot that, albeit a few extremely minor and insignificant plot-holes, ultimately delivers a punctual, sensible, fun and emotional ride for every kind of viewer. But I guess none of those adjectives describe any of the prior films in the Star Wars Saga either, right?",0
2262,2.0,"Let me say this first, I'm not hating on this movie because of the acting or the diversity involved. Ridley,Boyega,and Isaac did the best they could in their situation. I don't mind the amount of non white actors involved and the gay kiss. What I'm truly disappointed about is that it totally goes against the Skywalker arc of the first six movies. The prequels were not well made but they at least had a story that fit well into the Original series. Anakin Skywalker is the chosen one. Period. Not Rey. Not Luke. Not Kylo Ren. Although people will argue that Palpatine has sith powers to ressurect himself, it was never well explained about how he truly came back. The whole movie was rushed. U see the giant star fleets that have just been hanging there doing nothing the last two movies, the new godlike powers that Rey and Kylo caused confusion. If force sensitive individuals had these abilities, why didn't we see this before? Plus, Palpatine was dead in the eyes of George Lucas. After this, I disregard the sequel trilogy as a disorganized trilogy that didn't have a complete epilogue after the original series. Star Wars as a whole ended at Return of The Jedi.",1
2263,9.0,"Just wondering why people hate this movie? The cinematography is cool, the music always good, their act also amazing, the story little fast at the beginning but more dramatic in the middle and the end, weapons and fighting plane so good.

2266,3.0,Too many things don't make sense.,0
2267,1.0,Disney had the chance to make this end well. They didn't however. The Force Awakens was just a new version (and not as good) of a New Hope. The Last Jedi was just a slap in the face of real SW fans. The Rise of Skywalker was poorly named as it had nothing to do with a Skywalker and it was ridiculous she called herself that. The movie rushed from one thing to the next and most of it was unbelievable (hey Rey where did you learn to sail). It was a disappointment but if you like action without a story you probably will like it.,0
2268,9.0,"While a bit too rushed and predictable, it's overall a fun and satisfying finale to the Skywalker Saga. Daisy Ridley was terrific. Adam Driver as well. The only gripe I have is that the final battle was just so rushed. Almost as if the movie ran out of steam. Still a great ride!",1

Now I, like most of the people who think with their heads and not with their paid heads, critically say that this episode is the most insignificant and rotten of all 11 films. There are no characters, the main character does not cause any emotions, it seems that the film goes on for five hours.",1

The writing was a little clichéd and I'm surprised that they made Rey x Kylo canon. That was so.. weird although I'm pretty sure the directors justified that by saying that Rey and Kylo always had chemistry between them. I don't know. Anyway, as always, the cinematography is incredible and so is the wonderful and talented cast. I'm really gonna miss the interactions between Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Poe Dameron during the press release. RIP Carrie Fisher.",1

2275,4.0,"Watching this reminded me of David Carradine movie Future Zone (1990) because of ""mystery parents"" plot mixed into general unambitious laziness. Rise of Skywalker in other hand reminded that there are more worse ways to go out than auto-erotically asphyxiating one self.",1

2279,1.0,"If you're not really into Star Wars and don't know much about it, I'd recommend this film for you, I guess. It's got great special effects and good cinematography, but lacks a good, logical story and, obviously, Star Wars logic. This is more like some kind of superhero or MCU movie. Some things that I've just witnessed should never happen in Star Wars. Let me set them (or the ones I remember) straight:",0

The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous. They leap to conclusions and events happen without any difficulty or reason. They introduce irrelevant characters for no reason.The only redeeming quality is the lightsaber battles that find that sweet spot between over the top and eventful. Horrible almost unwatchable",0

I wish I could get my money back and somehow convince at least 1 person not to waste theirs. If I could save just one, it would be worth it. I dont see how this new trilogy has convinced any of the younger generations to jump on board the star wars fanboy train. At this point, they are cinematically comparable to whatever movie Dwayne Johnson has in theaters at any given weekend.",0
2293,6.0,"FIRST THINGS FIRST!!! why is this movie named Rise of the Skywalker? There are no Skywalkers remaining. Ray is not a Skywalker! Anyway - I really wanted to like this movie. Its not terrible but, it is not good. Some of the action scenes are pretty good and the characters are ok. My main annoyance in this movie.......... actually the entire trilogy, are the villains. In the original movies Darph Vader was epic, powerful and no one messed with him, and the Emperor was in the background so we knew he existed and knew there was a chance we might come into contact with him, which we did. In this trilogy we have Kylo-Ren who started off awesome! until he took his helmet off and we realised he looked like a foot. Then he turned into a wimp. Snoke: I was so intrigued by his character. Then in episode 8 = basically, we found out he was a testicle, wearing a suit, killed off without actually telling us anything. Then episode 9 - the emperor just kind of appears from no where with a brand new manicure and in serious need of a wash and moisturiser. No build up to him in any of the other movies apart from hearing a laugh at the end of episode 8 (probably because he just got his nails did). If we knew he existed in episode 7 we could have at least had a build up to a final showdown between Ray and the Emperor. At least it would have been a consistent background story. Anyway - the Emperor is supposed to be this all mighty, all powerful character and he is defeated by someone much weaker than him just because she is wielding a light saber. I was SOOOOOO disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan then i wouldn't recommend watching this as it was disappointing as as a mo-fo.",0

The prequels helped to put the original in a new light so I liked the originals better. The sequel trilogy has concluded the story. I thought the end battle between Rey and Palpatine was epic. To me the ending struck the right tone. I do feel like there was a lack of character development for some characters like Poe and Finn. I am curious to see what Feige does with Star Wars. I really like what he did with Marvel. I wonder if Solo would have done better if released before Force Awakens? Personally I loved Solo, but I know a lot of people didn't.",1

There's so much focus on Star Wars politics, who's directing it, who owns Lucas films, and all that junk that people are going into this trying to see the politics through the story. This is not the adventures of Kathleen Kennedy and her battles against Sith Johnson with the help of Jedi Abrams. If you go into this movie thinking it's some kind of apology for TLJ or that it's going to ""ruin"" RotJ and it's all because George Lucas abandoned us and Kennedy sold out to the Disney corporate devils, then you will get what you are looking for.",0

They didn't even try in this movie. It was so bad. SPOILER: The whole point of Anakin turning to the dark side was because he couldn't save his mother or Padme from dying. Now all of a sudden, Rey and Kylo can just touch each other and bring each other back from the dead. What was the point of 1-6 then? What was the point of 7 & 8 if snoke was just a clone made by Palpatine? It's awful all around. Disney said screw it just make some big light show and put it out. Screw 1-6 and screw 7 & 8 (even though 8 was terrible too). Rian Johnson screw the trilogy, but JJ didn't exactly help anything either in this movie. He actually made it much worse.",0

Why Kathleen Kennedy, in her years as a producer on many of Spielberg's efforts & being married to Frank Marshall (another big time producer) some things may've worn off on her as to how to run a tight ship but as evidenced by the jazz like nature of this trilogy's construction (& even in the stand alone films Rogue One & Solo which also went through their own problematic births) one has to ask, what were you thinking? Anyhoo, J.J. Abrams (who I loved what he did w/the first Star Trek film, a franchise he admits he had no affinity for) works his usual grand idea scheme (w/sloppy follow through) which according to the social media community (which is already going gaga over Colin Trevorrow's aborted episode 9 story-line) is enough for a hanging but what did they expect?

There are things I liked, again the Kylo Ren arc is compelling, there was potential for so much more, but Adam Driver is such a great actor that Rise Of Skywalker comes to life whenever he's on screen, which unfortunately is not often enough. The first 30 minutes or so is Indiana Jones rip off territory as Finn,Poe and Rey look for a sith artifact and it's really dumb. Like really, really dumb. Again, this is what Cannon films Star Wars would look like. The redeeming quality here is that the movie works better as a schlocky action flick better then it does as Star Wars. So it's not boring and even has it's moments.

This movie had to fix so much that ep8 ruined, the sequels movies were derailed by ep8 and it forced the writers to correct many things in ep9. Add that to the death of a main actor and a rabid fan base and this is what we got. It's so far above the childish and poorly acted prequels (except ep3, only decent film) this movie is entertaining, well acted, filled with interesting lore and has a great pace. Yet fake fans will cry that it's worse than phantom menace. Ha give me a break. Disney is killing it with Star Wars, 2/3 sequel movies are great, mando tv series is great. But the haters just keep complaining. And ep8 die hards the ep9 because it openly mocked decisions and themes from ep8. They can't handle it, that movie was so boring, ruined the finn character, introduced boring new characters, had little to no action, zero light saber on saber fights, wasted sith cave potential story with Rey. Luke treated like garbage and underused. And the worst visuals of leia flying through space like Mary Poppins. Terrible! Ep9 cgi leia training with Luke was more badass Jedi for leia than ep8. Such a wasted film. Very few good scenes. Finn was sidelined on a dumb mission that looked like the worst parts of Harry Potter. Instead finn should have been training as a new Jedi like they planned in ep7. Wasted the whole sequel potential on ep8. Useless. Luckily ep9 saved the day.

2337,7.0,"The nice thing about living in Brazil is watching Star Wars the day before everyone else in the States.<br /><br />Here is my spoiler-free review.<br /><br />This was the first Star Wars film that I was NOT excited about seeing. I didn't like The Last Jedi especially after seeing it the second time, so needless to say, I went into this with exceedingly low expectations. JJ Abrams managed to make a great Star Wars film. I was really really impressed with what he did with what he had to work with. The characters and the story surprised me in a good way. This is a great Star Wars film. JJ Abrams went back to the basics and told a story a story of good vs evil with interesting characters. I wish that the Last Jedi would have been better because it would have really made this one even more great, but it reminded me of a really good episode of the Mandalorian or Star Wars Rebels or Clone Wars (Cartoon). I give this a 8-9/10. Great movie. Go check it out. You won't regret it.",1
2338,3.0,"It's sadly another poor Star Wars offering that rounds off the main new trilogy poorly. What it lacks in story depth it tries to make up for in battles, explosions and nostalgia, and just like it's two predecessors that used these points to get by the lack of charecter development gives you no real reason to care for who wins. This is a two and a half hour film that feels like it's two and a half hours long.<br /><br />Small children might enjoy it but for anyone else this is a drag, and a real disappointment if you're old enough to have watched and enjoyed the first six.",0
2339,10.0,"I really don't understand 1/10 rating from supposedly starwars fan. With all Easter Egg in this movie that link all starwars from episode 4 to today we cannot put 1/10 rating. For me people that give 1/10 are Star Trek fan not Starwars fan :-) I saw the last Starwars today and I was not disappointed. For sure, that is not a perfect movie but it reminds me all ""Souvenirs"" i had for the first Starwars Episode IV and feel some nostalgia that now the story end. I understand that previous one TLJ was not so good but it Starwars universe and in this universe the spirit are the same in all Starwars Movie or Story. For Sure, Starwars Universe belong to George Lucas(the creator) and I remember when he decide to make episode 1 to 3, some fans was disappointed by his work but it his world and no Fan cannot understand this universe more than George Lucas. For me rating 5/10 is fair for the last Episode if you have been disappointed. I put 10/10 because if the lot of unfair 1/10. Seriously to put 1/10 you cannot be real Starwars fan. Who else tells me the contrary is a liar. I was 7 when I saw the Episode IV and since I am and always be a Starwars Fan. I recognize that some episode are not so good but I will never never never put a 1/10 rating :-p",1

2347,1.0,"Last Jedi was pretentious bad movie this is just a bad movie. Its long, boring and looks cheap. JJ should be forbidden to ever again write a script, he has no skills for writing a story, even a bad one-you are looking for a thing that will lead you to a place where the bad guy is hiding. Terrible. Along the way while you hunt one McGuffin after another there are filler pointless chases, other action scenes on land or space and lightsaber duels that we already seen before (done way better, all action scenes are just BAD). But the worst part for me are cringe moments coming at you left and right-stupid JJ ideas that only he thinks are cool because he has a mind of a 12yo. ( Kylo Ren, Zombie Emperor, Knights of Ren that look like they would better fit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail etc.) All this combined with tons of fast talking exposition dumps to explain to the viewers what is happening and why. And at the end of all this Star Wars dies. Whole experience was a chore, if at least action was fun or its so bad that its funny, but no. No redeeming qualities, even acting is terrible (not the actors fault its the direction and script, they had nothing to work with.) One of the worst movies I ever watched. I wish I could give it a 0.",0

2349,9.0,". . . I was fairly dismissive of all that jazz about the SITH being indistinguishable from the terrestrial Pachyderm Party. After all, I thought, Jerry ""Stumble-foot"" Ford reincarnated as ""Jar-Jar BINKS""?! ""Come on, get real"" an inner voice objected. However, as several new books out in the past two months document, STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER continues this saga's uncanny knack of dove-tailing closely with Real Life, from 1900s SITH ringleaders Noxious Nixon and Ford to more recent criminals, including The Gypper, The Weasel and The Orange Buffoon (obviously a dead ringer for Emperor PALPATINE). Just as Real Life unmasked the fact that Jar-Jar was a SITH mole, The Art of STAR WARS discloses that our POTUS #45 is a satanic SITH (aka, Red Commie Russian Kremlin KGB) asset, planted inside America's once-hallowed Oval Office to dance around like a marionette on strings--a pawn with no volition of its own, compelled to surrender wars, treasonously give up military secrets, betray and back-stab loyal allies, torment Ukraine and degrade the USA into a hellacious lawless knock-off of Mother Russia. STAR WARS IX's #1 takeaway? The Force WAS with us, but now its ""Long Live the SITH!""",1
2350,8.0,I had a blast watching this. Was It perfect? No but you can't expect perfection. There's so many people complaining about little things that you forget movies are supposed to be fun.

Much better than last Jedi for sure and I didn't even hate that one like a lot of people do.,1
2351,8.0,"The two thirds of this film is exhilarating and respectful to the series, similar to the feeling you have watching Return Of The Jedi. The new characters are more immersed in their roles, and the new additions work well.

I've been a long time Star Wars fan and overall, this is a really enjoyable film.",1
2352,7.0,"Yes, an obvious comparison with MCU is inevitable. A franchise, which is loved so much by all, should only be begun if one has clear idea of a satisfactory ending. Such is the SW-TROS. It's a visual treat, no treat. But in the end, though there is a feeling of end, yet, someting feels a bit - incomplete. There are twists, sub plots...but there is a want for more.

Soon the Resistance is shocked to discover an old enemy on the Dark Side of the Force is still alive- Emperor Palpatine. The most powerful enemy in this galaxy is still somehow alive... The team is sent to find a way to deal with the Emperor, accomplishing multiple objectives along the way and forcing Rey to deal with her own personal conflicts.

You have to have the IQ of a rock to sit through this hot mess. Disney please please stop making Star Wars movies. smfhThe genesis of the problem with this trilogy is that there was never a detailed blueprint for this saga. It feels as if they were making it all up as they went along. This saga needed a Kevin Feige type figure to shepherd these movies. Instead we got Kathleen Kennedy with her agenda. Ah well hopefully after this mess will be the last SW movie that the Mickey Mouse company make. Agree?A Very Dumb Movie,0

You got most of the classic heroes but I noticed that Yoda wasn't on this movie so that was a downfall.

2363,4.0,"I understand its not easy making a movie but Rise of Skywalker sums up why most big blockbusters this year underperformed. Everything in this movie was hacked together, poor executed, and no real character development. It was literally watching JJ Abrams put on screen every idea he could think of because he could. There are two ice planets and two desert planets in this movie for lack of originality. Palpatine was brought back as an attempt to make more money and his plan to bring forth the Final Order is the worst evil genius plan of all time. The movie features the laziest lightsaber duel of all time and other lazy and uninspired action scenes. The biggest space battle in Star Wars history is also the most anti-climatic. I can go on all day but one of the greatest movie franchises of all time is finally reduced to nothing in the name of maximizing profits instead of delivering something of quality. The prequels had their own issues that George Lucas mostly rectified in Revenge of the Sith but the JJ Abrams Sequel trilogy went completely downhill once Last Jedi came out and rock bottom with this movie. Despite the leaks and whatnot, the ending actually is pretty decent, maybe a bit hokey to some but most of the dramatic moments in the movie are quickly undone by pointless scenes and exposition. This was a sad way to end a 9 film saga. Rogue One and Solo outshine Episodes VIII and IX. Wait till its on video if I were you.",0

Disney haven't totally destroyed star wars after this, just the things Rey does is just ridiculous. The main plot for the first half of the film was pointless, none of the cast seemed to have any charisma with each other all they did was bicker and argue. Just wow I actually laughed out loud in the screening at the last scene it was so predictable and cringe worthy and forced, Disney should be ashamed of what they have done with George's universe",0

This is the final(ish) story of an inter-galactic war that's been raging for centuries. It's epic in scale and it portrays that well. As always the special effects are amazing.<br /><br />There are a lot of new characters introduced, some that I hope to see in future movies. There was the odd laugh, some very poignant moments, and some solid fan service. Go and see it.",1

2370,1.0,"Statutomania: (n.) 1. A compulsion for collecting complete sets. My mother had it too. She never completely kicked her need to own every Beatles album and single, buying every EX-Beatle recording as well... she just skipped over the Yoko Ono stuff. For my part, I've struggled with this all my life. If I lack even one piece of a complete set of anything, it drives me clinically . So it was with Star Wars. Episodes IV to VI were near-perfection to me (I'd have been fine without C-3PO/R2-D2 and the Ewoks), so I bought the DVDs. Then Episode I Featuring He Who Must Not Be Named came out; in spite of the resulting odor coming from my DVD shelf, I picked it up anyway. After all, the packaging was still uniform so I still had the whole set, and I might still watch the Darth Maul scenes from time to time. Episodes II and III came out, and they were slightly more watchable. I was content, having the existing six. Rogue One was an okay addition thereafter. Then, Episodes VII to IX and Solo happened. I'd found MY Yoko Ono! But on a much grander scale, enough that I never want to see another Star Wars creation as long as I live. Even if you don't hate Kathleen Kennedy's woke feminist agenda, the latest trilogy was a complete wreck of storytelling from every angle, making the ""midichlorians"" thing seem legit by comparison. The sole redeeming feature I was able to find in the whole thing was that they finally gave Chewbacca some emotional depth. I suppose it was also nice to see the robots given minimal exposure and used for something more than Laurel-and-Hardy appeal to 3-year-olds. My Star Wars DVD collection sits at seven, and there it will remain. Never say it can't get worse.",0

If Palpatine was alive and had so many ships why didn't he contact the First Order when Star Killer base was so FO could have overpowered basically anyone. If any rebels tried to hide far from SKB First Order could have sent a Sith Destroyer. They also invented some force teleport ability.

Bordered on ridiculous at the end. I am a huge fan but find the last trilogy to be very poor. Only decent film to come from Disney is Rogue One. For me this doesnt close the Skywalker story.

The final scene seemed like a parody, I can't believe they would let their character who dreams of oceans and loves greenery end up on a barren dead planet alone with her pet droid. There are a lot of plotholes, and I wouldn't rate this 1/10 just for that, I rate it that way because this is not how Star Wars should make people feel, and I feel nothing but despair.

But for a fan who is looking for fascinating characters and some unforeseen plot twists like the original trilogy gave us (Darth is Lukes father for example) this whole thing here is like the MTV version of a Star Wars movie. They missed every single time they had the chance to build up some suspense by starting the movie already with the biggest blow: Palpatine! WTH? This would have been a great chance to reveal in the first third of the movie and not in the text at start.

Nevertheless, it has a good cast and stunning settings. Moreover, John Williams' marvelous music definitely succeds in conveying energy to the movie and in awakening the audience's emotions too. You should not forget that this movie had two hard tasks: not only had it to fix several plot holes inherited from ""The Last Jedi"", but also it had to end one of the most beloved (and I'd add: most worshipped) sagas in the cinema's history! I think both main actors, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, performed excellently throughout the entire trilogy.

It did feel like a 2 hour and 22 min film). I never really got the chance to care about anything happening.<br /><br />I like Star Wars just enough to not get lost on parts of the story that would relate to other movies. Sure, chances are everyone has seen all 8 movies before, but if you have not seen the last two than this movie's got nothing for you.

Well, guess what - she is.<br /><br />Really? You didn't get a better idea for some twists and ideas than a guy who only enjoys watching good movies? Shame on you.<br /><br />That's no story. That's the paltry try to save a misguided trilogy with lots and lots of unnecessary fan service.<br /><br />That's much worse than the most boring two hour long hunt for a starship in Episode 8 where even the dumbest people in the audience must have ask theirselfs why the First Order didn't ask for a second ship to cut off the path of the resistance ship? I mean.. hellooooo.... first order has at least more than two ships, right? Even the debates in the Galactic Senate has been more exciting.<br /><br />J.J.

Some ridiculous Harry Potter sorcery & insta heal potions?? I mean come on!! This was not Star Wars?<br /><br />And the writing was as bad as it comes.

2408,6.0,"Disney acquiring Lucasfilm was a great decision, the first of the new space saga sequel movies The Force Awakens was brilliant, and the second film The Last Jedi was very good, and after 42 years since the release of the original Star Wars, this was the final film of the franchise, directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, a threat of revenge has been received from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), assumed to be dead years ago. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), having obtained a Sith wayfinder device on the planet Mustafar, finds the Emperor on the uncharted planet Exegol. The Emperor reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the Dark Side. Palpatine then releases a secret fleet of Star Destroyers and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is continuing her Jedi training, with the help of Resistance leader General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). A spy within the First Order has delivered information, which Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) say reveals Palpatine's location on Exegol. Rey meanwhile learns from notes left by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) about a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) depart in the Millennium Falcon for the planet Pasana to find an ally as recommended by Leia. There, they find Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who points them in the direction of the wayfinder's last suspected location. Kylo learns where Rey is through their Force bond and travels there with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. Rey and the others discover the remains of the assassin Ochi of Bestoon (Liam Cook), his ship and droid, and a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from translating. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Rey tries to save Chewbacca, but accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. The group escape in Ochi's ship, assuming that Chewbacca is dead. Poe suggests traveling to Kijimi to have the Sith text extracted from C-3PO's memory. C-3Po's memory is wiped in the process, but coordinates reveal that a wayfinder is on Kef Bir. Rey senses that Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission. While Kylo searches for Rey, the group infiltrates his Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), an old acquaintance of Poe's. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of her mother (Jodie Comer) and father (Billy Howle) being killed with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; he reveals that Ochi was ordered by the Sith lord to recover Rey as a child, but she was hidden by her parents for her protection on Jakku. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself to be the spy. He lets them escape on the Falcon but is executed by General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) for treason. The group arrives on Kef Bir. Resistance sympathiser Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leads them to the remains of the second Death Star, where the wayfinder is located. Finn is surprised to find out that, like himself, Jannah is also a former stormtrooper, and was one of many deserters. Kylo tracks them down, destroys Rey's wayfinder and asks her to join him to go against Palpatine. Leia is dying, before passing away she calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as he duels with Rey, who impales him. Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo using the Force and takes his ship. She returns to Ahch-To, where the Force spirit of Luke encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey uses the wayfinder in Kylo's ship to make her way to Exegol. After healing, Kylo talks to the spirit of his father, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after which he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. The Resistance then see the planet Kijimi obliterated by a Star Destroyer equipped with a super laser. At the Resistance base, R2-D2 (Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey) restores C-3PO's memory upon the group's return. The Resistance follows Rey's coordinates to Exegol, where she confronts Palpatine. The Emperor wants her to kill him, being his relative he wants to transfer his spirit into her body. Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle against Palapatine's army, the Last Order. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine drains the pair's power to rejuvenate himself. He attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning and incapacitates Ben. Rey is weakened, she hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Ben revives Rey by transferring his life force into her; they kiss and Ben dies, becoming one with the Force, along with the body of his mother Leia. The remainder of Palpatine's armada are successful destroyed by the Resistance. As the Resistance celebrates, Rey visits the abandoned home of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own. A passerby asks her name; she replies, ""Rey Skywalker"". Also starring Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, composer John Williams as Oma Tres and Mary Poppins Returns' Lin-Manuel Miranda as a Soldier, with the voices of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, Andy Serkis as Snoke, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Ewan McGregor as the younger Obi Wan Kenobi, Sir Alec Guinness as the older Obi Wan Kenobi, Frank Oz as Yoda, Freddie Prinze Jr. As Kannan Jarus and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. The appearances of Hamill, Ford and Fisher (through unused footage from The Force Awakens) are good, Boyega and Isaac are great as the heroes, and McDiarmid returning as the sinister Emperor is welcome, but I agree with critics that this film pretty much belongs to Ridley and Driver, delivering the key moments that will bring the show to a close. I will be honest and say that this finale to the saga is almost the same quality as Return of the Jedi, enjoyable, but just that tiny something missing, perhaps it is lacking a little emotionally. However, you cannot ignore the spectacular battle sequences, the brilliant special effects and the well-paced action, all together it is a terrific worthwhile science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Good!",1

2410,1.0,This film didn't tie into the last abomination. Felt like the writers sat around whilst smoking herbs and drinking burning liquor and put pen to paper. Introducing more pointless characters and creatures for no apparent reason other than I assume they owe the actors/ extras a favour. Storyline was ridiculous.

But stick with it and it eventually finds its feet. As per usual the visuals are on point and they paint the Star Wars universe in a beautiful, breath taking way. I love the acting ability of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver and it's great to see the other new actors being put to better use this time around. But overall everything in this film felt a bit forced, from the dialogue, humour, certain plot twists which didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense and the over abundant fan service which cropped up in every other scene. Everything gets tied up neatly as possible at the end, but instead of feeling emotional that this saga was drawing to a close, I just felt a little bit meh.",0

This technical that technical and none of you actually think hmmmmm maybe there are people in this world who haven't read every comic and know every bit of lore. In fact most of you writing critical reviews focus on what's bad not what is good. If you search for the bad you'll find it and if you pay for a movie to have a fun experience then you most likely will have a good time. And all of you saying blah blah this about comic this that and this isn't really accurate are just regurgitating what you saw on YouTube. I mean seriously it's the same things every time and you never actually do any thinking. You just listen to SWT and decide hmmm well if he doesn't like it let's spread the word and say the exact same thing he did! Just saying all y'all need to chill and just watch a movie to have fun and not to tear it to smitherines you self proclaimed ""professional"" critics! Huuuuuuuuuhhhhhh! I in fact liked the movie so there HA!",0
2431,1.0,"This film is a complete and utter disaster. Even leaving aside the fact that JJ Abrams didn't build on what Rian Johnson created, but like a child throwing a tantrum decided to completely cancel what was set before him only to make a film that is arguably an entire trilogy hastily and haphazardly jammed into a single episode, ""Rise of Skywalker"" still is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It takes every single one of the mistakes made in the course of the other Star Wars films, magnifies them and shoves them in the public's face. The cliches, the mistakes, the predictability, plot armour so thick not even the whole Sith Fleet would be able to scratch it and Disney's need to make it a fairytale story that panders only to an audience of toddlers; all of these are some, SOME, of the reasons why TRoS sucks. But it's all made worse by the fact that this flaming wreck is supposed to be the ending of the Skywalker saga. Going into the theatre I was wary, giving what Episodes 7 and 8 were, but still hoped to find a dignified end to this magnificent voyage that started 40 years ago. By the end I was in utter shock: it had not only been not good, but it was beyond the most horrifying nightmare: the already low bar I'd set for this film was reached, surpassed and left in the rear view mirror. To conclude, do yourselves a favour and instead of watching this, do literally anything else but. This movie takes the last forty years of Star Wars, flushes them down the toilet, then nukes the toilet, then puts salt on the barren, radioactive wasteland that is left behind.<br /><br />Congratulations Disney, you've killed a legend.",0
2432,9.0,"Don't read spoilers. Don't worry if you were slightly annoyed by The Last Jedi, because that director is gone. Abrams basically channelled the anger of fans and sticks a middle finger up at most of the things that just weren't sitting right from TLJ.",0

2434,10.0,"As an avid Star Wars fan I may be a bit more forgiving than some, but the people giving it below a 5/10 had their minds made up before it came out. This was never going to make them happy, they've spent months digging for leaks on a movie they claim to not care about. As someone who was there for the release of the prequels it's pretty common for these movies to get hate on release and be highly appreciated a decade later. This movie is dense, fast movie and I'll admit it should have been 20-30 minutes longer. None of that changes how fun the ride is and how fitting and end to the story It is. While at times you may say to yourself ""I didn't expect that"" upon reflection it's fitting with the old George Lucas saying ""it's like poetry, it rhymes"". I say judge the movie for yourself and when you get there just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1
2435,2.0,"In my opinion, this entire trilogy was a mistake. No true vision, just a moneymaking engine for Disney who have more then enough of that. There was no consistency or theme throughout this trilogy because 8 was extremely controversial and rewrote a lot of the Star Wars mythos. Then this film came along and claimed that that was all a bad dream and makes the safest most dull Star Wars film of all time. The Force Awakens, in my opinion, was the only film in this trilogy which was even remotely enjoyable and didn't feel like it had 8 different visions clashing throughout. This film is a boring, contradictory mess with no hint of creativity or anything that made the Original Trilogy as great as it was. This film feels like it can just throw in some triumphant music in the last ten minutes and we'll forgive all it's flaws. I wish I could say that I was disappointed, but I really expecting much anyway from Jar Jar Abrams. They want him to be the head of DC and Warner Bros now, god help us all. This film is such a trainwreck. Do yourselves all a favour, and watch ""The Mandalorian"" or the upcoming, long anticipated Season 7 of Clone Wars.

As expected the graphics and cinematography was excellent with a story that built upon the original trilogies and PERHAPS again closed off the saga again, but it felt like a good extension which had been slightly reworked.",1

2449,6.0,"Ever since the release of The Last Jedi, it was quite evident that Disney did not have a plan as for where this trilogy was to go. And this film just about highlights that. After a film that disappointed many Star Wars fans and kicked the trilogy down a twisted road, Abrams decides to attempt to bring it back on track. However while doing this he must keep in mind that the trilogy must come to an end in this film. As well as the entire Star Wars saga. And here lies the main problem with this film. It tries to be so many things in just one film! Obviously all of this can't be flawlessly accomplished in one film, which makes the entire film seem like a giant mess within the mess, many things get left behind like whatever Finn was going to tell Rey and any romantic chemistry between Rey and Ben.<br /><br />However amid all of this criticism, I believe it is an overall good film. Why? Well because with what it was given, it managed to put a cap on the trilogy in a way that feels slightly satisfying which is quite surprising given the atrocious flaws of The Last Jedi. As a Saga conclusion, it also manages to feel cohesive in a way. It makes sense that Palpatine is the main villain controlling the story considering he has been in the past two trilogies. Coming out of The Last Jedi, I felt uncomfortable and disappointed with the lousy answers it provided. In contrast, I am happy with the answers this film provides as it justifies its existence in the Star Wars Universe. I just wish that they had sat down at a table before they even started on The Force Awakens and decided precisely how the entire trilogy was to be played out. I'm sure that if they had done this we would have avoided TLJ's problems thus avoiding the messiness of this film. To conclude this review, it wasn't necessary this film's fault for being all over the place, as it did it's best job. It was TLJ's fault for tipping the direction of the trilogy midway through.",0

In one we are using the gravity well of a planet to pull the Millennium Falcon out of hyperspace, as is canonically accurate, then in the next we are shooting hyperspace jumps from the hip and popping in and out on different planets... I guess hyperspace jumps ARE like dusting crops after all!?",0

I wont Even care to elaborate... ok i will elaborate on this: ive kept an open mind through this whole triolgy, i didnt want to say the last two movies were trash untill they finished the triology, i had hopes, sure they were in deep water storywise with last jedi and force awakens, but this was just an attempt to put it all together, and it failed, horribly. Incoherent, stupid, just terrible, instead of understanding what the last 6 movies were about, and doing something creative with it, they made something that dosnt have anything to do with starwars, and thats Odd considering it having plenty of starwars characters, lightsabers, space ships and Even a star wars title..",0

Since the Disney Star Wars trilogy came out it has become almost a sport to hate them. Just like it was when the prequels came out. The vitriol against these films is I think so outrageous that I think some people just want to hate them. Now, the same people that despised George Lucas for Episodes 1-3 now suddenly like them in favor of these new episodes. I said in my previous reviews that I LOVE all of these films. I love the universe that George Lucas created. When the prequels came out I was disappointed a little just like most people were because they just felt different than the original trilogy.

By the way, he not dead (that thing about ""Luke accomplished nothing"") He sprinkles wayfinders across the galaxy that will help find his lair, he doesn't want found. I could have picked out tons of plot holes, nonsense, undeveloped, why moments. Not going to bother, you can watch hours of Youtube video that explain it eloquently. Why write a novel here? Then the final stab. After being told by Leia not to be embarrassed of who she is. She totally denies it at the end of the movies. Instead, she decides she wants to be referred to as the superhero in a cape. She's a SKYWALKER! No wonder why no one knows who the Jedi are after several dozens years in this universe!

That being said, I still enjoyed it and even saw it to commemorate my grandmother (and last living grandparent) dying.

It felt to me like a stand-alone movie, not part of a trilogy or saga. Parts didn't make a bit of sense in places...I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it because there were still some cool surprises even though I already knew some things.

2477,6.0,"I have just seen Episode IX and it was a mixed bag of emotions, SFX and dramatic scenes. I remember seeing the original Star Wars a long time ago in a Galaxy far far away (1977) and all of the subsequent films. The issues with THIS Trilogy is that it is a LONG time after the originals, so it had to bring something 'fresh' while not losing sight of the huge Fan-base of older SW lovers. After the criticism levelled at 'last Jedi', it was clear that a huge effort was needed to bring the Saga back on course for the Finale. By and large, JJ Abrams and his Team managed to put a half decent film together which fully reflects our current generation, superb SFX, huge nods to both the past films and a deliberate attempt to correct some of the issues with LJ. It also suffers from things that lots of current Films do - poor writing, poor character development, poor plotting and a real sense that we have seen half of this before. If you are a real Star Wars purist, then the fact that this entire new Trilogy 'dispenses' with Anakin Skywalker COMPLETELY indicates that the people making these have missed a major point! It is easy to criticise the makers for NOT continuing the mythology BUT a nod would have been in order. On the plus side, both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley give it their all - despite some uninspired dialogue by the writers - and their ARE some genuine moments of emotion and farewell. Despite the flaws, 'Rise of Skywalker' does a pretty good job of seeing out the 'Disney Trilogy', while not quite achieving that for the Saga as a whole.",0

Any director views it as cash grab and a movie for children. Its fun for them screwing it all up. bragging right and ego boost. at best they just try to fake what audience connected to.

A lot of scenes like Leia's Jedi training was very good and gave you a good backstory, the scene with undead palpatine was also very good.

Are they groundbreaking? Not since A New Hope (1977), in my opinion.

There is certainly an argument to be made that as the ending to a saga it should definitely pay off on and make congruent and logical storytelling flow from that of its predecessors. But because I never felt such a strong attachment to the franchise I thought as it is, Rise of Skywalker was a really good movie, with exciting action and sci-fi elements and a narrative that ultimately centers around the fight between good and evil.",1

I am not swayed by the nostalgic insertions of cameo appearances (I did appreciate legendary John Williams and out of costume Anthony Daniels cameos though). I will not tell people to make up their own mind and watch it because that coats the money pockets of bad writers and is an enabling device to develop more trash with attendance numbers.

It is a beautiful, incredible experience to look back on within my childhood. People giving this film a 1/10 or anywhere close to this are not only robbing potentially new fans of the saga, but also giving the entire legacy a disservice. Sure, there are a couple of questionable moments, some major financial injections. That doesn't automatically make this film rubbish? The acting, the direction, the way the scenes chop and change, the feeling any REAL star wars fan gets from the script is superb!!

It is not Star Wars whatsoever, it is a generic and lifeless action-adventure with a Star Wars theme, locations and characters. It has been a whole trilogy yet all characters remain undeveloped, uninteresting and cliched and the story has the quality of a first time writer. It is painfully predictable to the point where it is cringe inducing. After The Last Jedi, I honestly didn't know what I was expecting but I didn't realize that they could stoop any lower. They just rinse and repeat the same formula every film: a threat that could destroy a planet or takeover the galaxy is introduced, the good guys fight against it and almost lose until they are saved or have luck to win in the end.

I actually really liked Palpapine being the mastermind behind everything that's happened over the past several movies. Granted, it wasn't perfect (a couple of spots were weird or made no sense - like the kiss at the end - and that's why I'm giving it a 9 and not a 10), but it was wonderful to watch.

2531,2.0,"Spoilers!<br /><br />Where to start with this one... Let me preface this with applause to JJ Abrams, because he managed to turn the trilogy at least somewhat around. There are few movies I hate more than The Last Jedi, not only for a Star Wars movie, but in general. Fans got insulted by a director that puts his own agenda over a 40 year old franchise with no apparent love for Star Wars. Almost every interesting thing from the Force Awakens gets destroyed by Rian Johnson, because he seemed to hate the setup he had been given. While The Force Awakens was far from perfect and a lazy ""reboot"" of the franchise, it still set up certain expectations that got subverted, because apparently the subversion of established plot points has been a personal favorite of Rian Johnson. Other problems, such as lore breaking actions and appalling attempts at humor seal the fate of the last Jedi. Therefore, the task to fix what came before seems to me like an impossible task and it turns out that it kind of was...<br /><br />One of my biggest gripes, that ultimately lets this movie fail for me, is the apparent lack of a coherent overarching story, that has been planned before shooting this trilogy. In the opening crawl, the movie reveals, that Emperor Palpatine is back and that he is trying to regain his power. How he survived the Fall into the abyss in Return of the Jedi and the subsequent explosion of the second Death Star is not explained in the movie. This is exactly where everything falls apart. The whole premise of this movie is not coherent with the information that was given prior to this movie. While bringing back Palpatine might seem like a good idea to trigger nostalgia, it starts the problem with everything in this movie being very convenient. Multiple deus ex machina moments in this movie make the whole plot of the movie uninteresting. An example for this is Rey conveniently learning additional powers that ultimately lead to her saving and being saved by Ben Solo.<br /><br />Furthermore, due to the sheer amount of stuff that has to be fixed, the first hour of this movie is very convoluted and the heroes stumble from one ""lucky"" happenstance to the next. The movie is also very heavy handed with fanservice, that purely exists to trigger nostalgia. Most cases are very on the nose and take you out of the movie experience. It is JJ Abrams actively talking to the viewer and course correcting The Last Jedi. There are multiple examples like a lightsaber that gets thrown away by Rey and caught by Luke's force-ghost, downplaying the odds of the ""Holdo-Maneuver"" , as it would break in-universe logic or Maz Kanata giving Chewbacca a Medal which he never received in the New Hope, course correcting a minor detail that some fans were upset about.<br /><br />The big reveal of Rey being a Palpatine begs the question, how and when Palpatine had a kid and with whom. Obviously it was used to explain why Rey is as strong, but the original plan of this trilogy never had this in mind or it would have been set up better in the past movies. Bens sacrifice and moment with Rey was fine, I was never invested in this love-story, therefore I do not share the problems a part of the fandom had with this scene. Rey ultimately choosing the name Skywalker and abandoning the Palpatine name seems like a good idea in theory, but it really doesn´t make much sense to me. Especially her going back to Tatooine with Poe's droid BB8 seems weird, as this sets her back to the beginning, being alone on a sand planet.<br /><br />The title The Rise of Skywalker ultimately seems weird, the hero of the saga, the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker's sacrifice did not matter, Palpatine lived and Rey, a Palpatine, is the last surviving force user.<br /><br />While this seems very negative, overall the implementation was enjoyable from time to time and the humor that was used was just as strong as it was in The Force Awakens. There was a lot of missed potential with side characters such as Finn, but the performance of all the actors was great. JJ Abrams managed to not let this movie completely crash and burn, therefore I have to commend him for overcoming the absolute mess that Rian Johnson created with The Last Jedi.<br /><br />4/10",0

2536,1.0,"The idea of reopening the Skywalker saga was a very questionable one to begin with. Return of the Jedi has long cemented it's place as one of the most beautiful pieces of closure in film history; the flawed prequel films only adding to its gravitas. Despite the evident perils of undoing this, there was barely any fan that wasn't excited to see this saga continue. Beyond the dangers lay potential of expanding the lore, of exploring the mysteries we'd not gotten answers to, and of learning about the legacy of the Skywalkers. Unfortunately these new films have not only utterly failed at fulfilling that potential, but have also managed to sour the two trilogies that precede them. The Rise of Skywalker is, naturally, the culmination of this souring: it's the final chapter of the trilogy that was meant to tie all 9 movies together, an endeavor doomed from the start in the absence of a (good) plan.",0
2537,10.0,"Yes, this fan catered to Star Wars fans. I don't see how making a Star Wars film catering to it's fanbase is a bad thing. Rian Johnson doesn't share that view, and it's evident in how uneven the final trilogy is.",0

2539,8.0,I enjoyed this one better than the last few tries. It was classic and paid homage to all the classic characters without dwelling on the point. It has a good and satisfying ending and success passes the franchise off to the future I think that's great for the next generation.,1
2540,6.0,"First of all, this movie is very predictable. I can't fully explain this but I made a joke yesterday about how this movie was going to end and I was completely right. Even while I watched this movie, I figured out somethings before they happened. The pacing in this movie is so bad because as much as this pains me to say this but this movie is kind of boring to sit through. The movie never really picks up the pace and everything just feels like they had to drag it out in order to get the longer run time. As much as I think J.J. Abrams is a good director this movie wasn't his strongest and I feel like it's because he has to try and explain everything that happened in, ""The Last Jedi"" in this movie which caused this movie to be slightly boring. Even the action scenes weren't the greatest. I really wanted to get into the finale action scene but honestly, I just couldn't. It was such a great experience getting to see it all happen but nothing really happened to bring me into the action and put me on the edge of my seat. I will give them credit for trying but then it immediately gets resolved which is another thing that bugged me was things getting resolved so quickly. Things got resolved so quickly that there were no threats for the audience to be like how are they going to get out of this one because something would happen and resolve it. I do have to say that I love what they did with Leia in this movie due to the passing of Carrie Fisher in 2017. All of the actors in this movie did the best they could with what they were given but it wasn't everybody's best work. Really the only good things about this movie is the nostalgia and John Williams score. In the end, The Rise of Skywalker could have been better if J.J. Abrams didn't have to do damage control. I definitely will rewatch this movie for a spoiler review and to cement my feelings on it.",0
2541,7.0,"... and came out mildly satisfied. I had two expectations of this film: (1) that it would be somewhat better than Return of the Jedi, which I consider the worst of the original trilogy; and (2) that it wouldn't completely retcon The Last Jedi. I consider it a modest success on both counts. Without getting into spoilers, I will say that while I have some issues with how The Last Jedi was treated by this film, it didn't erase it from existence.",0
2542,3.0,"This movie feels like they did the least amount of preparation. The writing feels rushed with lack of depth. There is no sense a maturing amongst the characters. Path of least resistance type of approach that shames the whole Star Wars franchise. If you aren't going to do the best you can with something of this magnitude, then let someone else do it who will. What a shame and a disgrace. This really could be said for the last 2 moves as well. Pathetic and sad, a spit in the face of what could of been if someone in power over at Disney actually cared.",0
2543,2.0,"What an absolute waste of time and money. This new trilogy of films has ruined the legacy of Star Wars beyond repair. Uninteresting characters who's motives seem to change every 10 minutes, lazy plots that could be written by an infant, terrible and needless jokes, and above all, a lead female actor who should've stayed on British daytime TV. This film is a fitting end to a trilogy that was made not by people who love and respect Star Wars, but by a corporation who want to squeeze as much money out of the franchise as possible. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because it's visually stunning, but it has to be when it has Mickey Mouse billions being pumped into it. If you haven't seen this film, or any of the new trilogy, don't bother, don't put yourself through it. Shocking effort",0

It's entertaining, it brings closure to this trilogy and even Rose has like 60 seconds of total screen time.<br /><br />Episode 7 was ok I guess, Episode 8 was a train wreck, so to me Episode 9 is a decent star wars movie, not the best of course, it's mainly ""by the book"", and fortunately has only a few crazy WTF moments (*minor spoiler* I mean... horses? really? over a star destroyer????) which are not bad enough to ruin the movie, like the Casino subplot on Episode 8.",0

Sipping a drink and enjoying the crowd around me in the cinema as laughter rippled around. Separate groups of friends, strangers, all sharing a similar communal moment...i mean it looked like starwars, it looked stunning and glittery and it looked like Jar Jar's technicoloured dream....it was mesmerising to watch, butterflies in tummy, some fireworks rise higher and higher in the sky, explosions of colour as far The more ""poignant"" the moment was supposed to be the more giddy mirth rained apon us. As a lifelong fan....it ozzed nostalgia and was like lapping up a great big star warsy caramel pavlova ice cream cherry cake.

I would have given it a 9.5 but I ll go with 10 just to bring up the curve from what ever fulness is goin on here.

2557,2.0,": Oh, do I really hate this movie. The Rise of Skywalkers is a complete Trump-ster fire and an unmitigated Trainwreck of a disaster. A tale told by an idiot, filled with flashing lights, and filled with sound and fury. Episode nine is part of the completely bankrupt culture and only exists to pop out in theaters and earn a bazillion dollars. And darn it, it DID make one billion dollars at the box office. And by the sounds of this review, Rise of Skywalker is the absolute worst thing to happen to Star Wars since the holiday special in 1978. I will shorten the plot analysis because I do not want to drive anyone, especially me, insane. So, the movie takes place a year after the last Jedi, Palpatine somehow survives. Wait WHAT?! But Palpatine died by the hand of Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. So, that means Darth Vader's sacrifice was invalid. And everything that happened in Return of the Jedi was all just a good joke, right? Isn't that great? Anyways, Rey is trained by Leia and Rey leaves with Poe and Finn and later get in a silly chase scene by the Stormtroopers because since Kylo Ren is the Supreme Leader now and listened to Palpatine's command and kill Rey. So, they blow up the troopers, but the get in the patch of quicksand and get sucked to their death. In the end, the Sith conquer the entire galaxy.",0

And the fans are right to be upset...100% right!<br /><br />But the blame does not fall on Disney. Disney does what any mega conglomerate does: it values money above any and all things. And JJ does what any average director does: he makes his bosses happy so that he may continue to work in the future. For me, its plain to see that the demise of this franchise falls squarely on one man...<br /><br />For you see....a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....one man grew his vision into the most imaginative and appealing franchises in movie making history. And then for reasons we will never know, he turned his back on that beloved creation and auctioned it off to the highest bidder After that, Star Wars existed no more.

2562,9.0,"If you dig deep, you'll find some flaws. It is obvious that Abrams tried to correct some of Johnson' s mistakes. Snoke had potential but got killed, so good old Palpatine had to return. Luke's depression in TLJ was rejected by fans, so Abrams needed to reconcile fans with the character. I don't think Rey was considered to be a Palpatine when Abrams started filming TFA and let's not even talk about Leia's role.Therefore, I think E9 was limited from the start . However, I felt entertained for two hours. Didn't like every aspect of the film but many of them. Space and lightsaber battles were good, Palpatine is, Vader left aside, still the best villain and the film contained enough nostalgia to give me some goosebumps. The closing scene at the Lars farm was the perfect ending, afore-mentioned goosebumps included. Even Billy Dee Williams had a nice appearance, just like Harrison Ford. Born in the late 70s, it was a perfect ending for me. I felt a bid sad but I also don't need another part. May the force be with you.",1

I hope that everyone who complains about this movie not living up to the legacy of Star Wars remembers that the legacy has been broken for a long time.<br /><br />This particular movie righted some of the wrongs of The Last Jedi, touched briefly on touchstones of all previous eight movies, and told a pretty good story along the way. In the end, I breathed a sigh of relief that at least this ""last"" movie wrapped things up fairly well. It's a solid ""B"" all around, which is what we all needed at this stage in the saga's history.",1

2567,9.0,"Forty-two years. That is the span of time between the beginning and the end. Like all good things, everything must.<br /><br />I went into this with medium expectations. I left floored. Disney has outdone themselves on this film, and I dare say it is second only to Empire.<br /><br />For those that are not familiar with the plot; The emperor has risen from the ashes and has an eye on concurring the galaxy yet again. To do this, he must defeat Rey, and he needs Kylo Ren to meet this end.<br /><br />As is the way of all things Star Wars, this is an epic tale of good versus evil. There are many laughs and also many tears to be had in this film. Many characters that you love will meet their end, and some heroes will rise from defeat. I do not like doing spoilers, so I will leave it at that.<br /><br />I will wind this up with the following; Episode 4, which was just called Star Wars back then, was the first movie I remember seeing. I was four and it had that strong of an impact on me. I have enjoyed all three of the trilogies, some more than others. Leaving the theater last night, I was left an emotional wreck, but I was satisfied with the ending. The scenes with Carrie Fisher were of course the saddest to me, yet if I did not know she had passed, I wouldn't have thought them so sobering. In conclusion, this was a great movie, I actually wish that it was longer.",1
2568,6.0,"What made the first 3 Star Wars movies great? The universe felt like the universe should feel: big and quasi-infinite. Luke Skywalker felt trapped on his Home Planet and would give anything to leave and go and explore. This universe feels small, connected as if any world is just around the corner. If you take away the magic of the universe, you take away the magic of Star Wars. A lot can be said about the casting. In any case, It's just hard to connect with any of the lead characters. I felt along with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo wasn't this guy instantly convinced of the cause of the rebellions. Unfortunately I couldn't care less about Finn, Rey,... Storywise, they tried to put some jokes in the movie but unfortunately, it just didn't work. There's no magic, no adventure. It's just all too much. In the good old days, one death star was the ultimate menace. Now they need to destroy thousands of them!? No, less is more.",0

Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has felt a disturbance in the force and goes looking for a Sith finder to gain access to the hidden Dark Side planet. It is there that Kylo learns that the Emperor Palpatine has raised himself from the dead using the Dark Side and has been running the first order from afar since its inception. They discuss Rey and Kylo promises to turn her at last to the Sith side and present her to the Emperor. As such, Rey also senses the same disturbance and comes to the conclusion that she, too, must get her hands on a Sith finder (there are only two in existence) and find out what's what. As the gang of Rey, Chewy, Poe, and Finn go to strange new worlds, the First Order has a traitor in its midst, giving them important clues. Also, Threepio, along for the ride, has valuable info in his being but, because of his programming to never reveal Sith information, the only solution is to find someone to exrtract the hidden data illegally. There is also, very importantly, new information about Rey's parents and grandparents. When Kylo and Rey finally meet, what side will be victorious? This superlative film has it all; great cast, grand story line, sensational settings, amazing art direction, fantastic special effects and a solid direction. Special mention in the cast should go to the return of Billy Dee Williams as Lando and newcomer but polished actor Richard E. Grant as the new general of the First Order. Also amazing are the glorious new creatures and alien beings which are delightful. Yes, there is a definite ending to the tale but is it really the last installment?

Forget the laws of nature and physics and enjoy the colors and whirly sounds.

Yet I always feel like a child sitting in the movie theater with at least one of my parents next to me. Star Wars makes me feel young and it is sad to see this is the real end. I was overall pleased and this sequel trilogy finally redeemed itself after a shaky start. I complained about The Force Awakens, then I saw improvement in The Last Jedi and finally The Rise of Skywalker makes it feel like the old Star Wars with old characters returning for nostalgia.",1
2612,1.0,"This movie is a complete mess. It hurts me to see how sharply the franchise has fallen. Even with the worst of the prequel movies there were at least elements or scenes that worked in and of themselves, but I cant think of anything positive about this movie. Nothing works. It's unbelievable that they released it into theaters in this state.",0
2613,10.0,"I don't get the criticisms, this movie exactly hit on every story thread and gave satisfying and complete resolution to them all. The perfect summation of a 9 episode story arc. I also liked the way they brought most all of the past characters back into the story, without overdoing it.<br /><br />OK, there was a scene or two that kind of dragged, especially in the first 20 minutes, but once Rey and Kylo Ren started to interact the story really takes off. If you are a fan of Star Wars, don't miss it!",1
2614,9.0,I just got out of an advanced showing and this was great. Loved every minute and it's way better than The Last Jedi. Glad J.J. Abrams came back to direct it. I've been a Star Wars fan since I was young and I'm glad that to this day I can still call myself one. 9/10. Highly highly highly recommend it.,1
2615,5.0,The Rise of Skywalker is like a failed super model - fabulous to look at but pointless on the inside. The return of Palpatine completely negates everything the original trilogy setup.,0
2616,6.0,"This trilogy was rough. The story was all over the place, messy, and attempting to throw in elements that change the foundation of the originals and prequels. Throwing in new force powers, bringing back the empire and the emperor even though he died in ROTJ, to me it was a mess. However, it was not all bad, and this trilogy did have a lot of cool moments never before seen in Star Wars. First off, Rey, Finn and poe; I thought the acting these characters and actors did was great. Especially Adam driver. We saw a lot of cool action not seen before in the previous movies. The visuals were great. The special effects and elements were great and cool at moments. It comes down to the bison and story of this trilogy as a whole. Disney clearly didn't have any vision and these movies are sadly attempted re hashes and almost remakes of the last movies, just with new characters with the repeated themes to try to appeal the newer audiences. I will say it's good for kids today growing up, they can look up to Rey and they can enjoy the newer movies. Maybe that's just what matters. The new generation will probably up with these movies, while we grew up with the originals. The problem is this movie completely destroys the whole point of return of the Jedi, anakins ark, etc. Vader fulfilled the prophecy by destroying the emperor and sith at the end of ROTJ. That was it. That was the true ending. Then Disney Tetris to alter it and add onto it, expect it doesn't or it doesn't add anything new. It's like they are trying to rewrite Star Wars canon. The ending for me in the originals was the REAL ending of star wars for me. That was perfect. These new movies tried to end it differently and say: ""well actually, no. The emperor is actually still alive. Rey is actually the real chosen one. Anakin and Luke's story meant nothing. That's what I got from this movies ending. The whole story was a mess for the news movies, but that's not to say they aren't enjoyable. The best way to look at these movies is if they are viewed as NON CANON, and that they are separate. They are spoofs. That's what these new movies felt. Spoofs. Still like I said. Kids will grow up with these movies and that's what's good. Just for me, it spat in the face of the originals. I enjoyed the sequels for some parts but nothing will ever top the true story and real ending that was established in the originals.",1
2617,3.0,First they pointed at the critics when The Force Awakens was released and called us fans stupid. Now that the critics have finally caught up and the fog has lifted from their eyes and call this nonsense bad they are attacking the critics.,0
2618,1.0,Out of its misery. All was thrown into the garbage with the last jedi and JJ didnt even attempt to correct it because Star Warz is in disrepair. It was a disgraceful ending to a disgusting ep.8. I would throw up but i already have been for 2 years. Force Awakens was brilliant btw. Ep.8 demands a public apology and is not aknowledged by our community so how could ep.9 be good? It cant so he put it to sleep. What a fuhqin disgrace. Truly nauseating. Star Wars died in 2017.

2623,10.0,I'm so glad jj did the final movie and made sure to tie up all the loose ends that TLJ didn't cover.<br /><br />This movie is awesome. I can't see anything wrong. On the contrary I see so many openings from the original movie trilogy that they closed. I'm so glad for this.,1
2624,6.0,"I personally think TROS is the the best and most enjoyable movie of the sequel trilogy. It's been obvious that the new trilogy was not well planned out, but JJ and team did a decent job tying up all the loose ends. The pace is fast and sometimes jarring, but the emotion is there. There are some fantastic moments, nods the older films (as to be expected) and reveals that are unexpected. Go see it and form your own opinion",1
2625,1.0,"Anybody giving this film 10/10 is mental or being paid by Disney to do so. Visually stunning but dreadful in every other sense bad story arc direction.<br /><br />The dialogue is beyond cheesy and so many segments that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. The story feels like it's been rushed in the making to get this film made no thought to the script or arc to this story from the first film ( The Force Awakens) made by Disney<br /><br />If your under 10yrs old you'll love it, if not take lots of sweets and something to drink to make having to watch it bearable",0

The action of this sequel still full of intense, and watchable fighting scene! Such as, pistol blasting scene, spaceship shooting scene, explosion scene, and light saber fighting scene! C-3PO character significantly funny in this sequel! At the end, Rey using her light saber and Leia's light saber to kill Emperor Palpatine! Rey wounded and dying on the ground, Kylo using his power to heal Rey! They kissing each other, Kylo eventually sacrifice by his heroic act! At the very end, an unknown old woman asking Rey real name! She answer ""Rey Skywalker""! That's it! A quite entertaining sequel!",1
2627,8.0,"""Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise Of Skywalker"" is a 2019 science fiction film directed by J.J. Abrams starring Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Before I went to the cinema, I heard how many fans and critics complained about the last installment of the Skywalker saga. But the older I get, the more I understand that people complain even about the smallest things and it didn't demoralised me to make an opinion myself. Especially when it comes to Star Wars. The screening I attended perfectly mirrored who SW is actually made for: There were a lot of teenagers and twenty-somethings as well as elder generations present. Doesn't sound quite extraordinary, but what fascinated me was that all of them shared the same experience, we all watched ecstatically and I could see in their reactions that we all felt the same. I made no exception. The film is everything else but bad. It's tight and action packed and didn't lack any suspense. Of course it also had minor flaws, but they weren't as catastrophic as all other fans were stating. The fact that Rey is the granddaughter of Imperor Palpatine is undeniably random and comes out of thin air, but it's elaborated in the story and hence bearable. They should have reworked the opening titles of pure cringe, that's for sure. But things like these don't make a film a disaster. In the same manner of the other films it told a story about the balance of the force. It didn't try to achieve anything else. Even more, I think it's sad that J.J. Abrams tried to apologize for what Rian Johnson supposedly did wrong (what he didn't, in my humble opinion). Either way, there we have it again. What bugs me the most about the fans is the general hypocrisy: TLJ did something that was unusual for SW, TROS used the same old pattern and fans raged because the film offered to much fan service and didn't even try to show some originality. Apparently, whatever you do, someone will always complain. The most important thing of all is the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this popcorn flick. I'm not so deep in this toxic fandom and as I already said about the previous installment, that's my biggest advantage. I sat in the cinema and had two and a half hours of a phenomenal time that made me feel like a child again. It's about fun and excitement, nothing else. If people can't sit back and simply relax, I'm sorry for that. I though, consider this as magical experience. It offered everything I asked for, because my expectations weren't so extremely high. Leia's death played a significant role, so did Ben Solo's sacrifice in the end. The most interesting character of the new trilogy, brilliantly played by one of my favourite newcomer actors, Adam Driver, got the perfect ending to his arc. He literally brought to an end what his grandfather Vader started. If he had survived it would not have made his character justice. I heard that many people criticised the ""force heal"" thing that, admittedly, created a few continuity errors, but even that could be logically explained by simply stating that her ancestor is the most powerful Sith lord of all time. Just saying. Furthermore, it had enough epic moments, cool lightsaber battles and an atmosphere that a part deep inside of me has missed for so long. It all worked well for me, someone who basically criticises the smallest details in any film. This time I shut off my mind and simply enjoyed a decent flick. Iit didn't bother me at all. It doesn't matter what others say, the fact that she calls herself Rey Skywalker in the end after burying the lightsabers at the place where it all began was neither cheesy or undeserved, I consider it as a respectful gesture and a well done homage to the original trilogy. The same counts for the scene in which she talks to the Jedi of the past. Call me a madman, but I liked it a lot. All in all, the final entry of the Skywalker saga is a flawed but still well done farewell to a glorious story of iconic characters, with a reputation worse than it actually is. As I already stated, no one hates Star Wars more than a Star Wars fan. If you're open minded an wanna have a good time, ignore the hate of the ""fans"", don't expect to much and you'll be rewarded with a great experience. I can see why people may not like it, but these are minor inconveniences that don't affect how great it is. It's not as dramatic as everyone says, in the end it's only a movie, made to entertain. Whether you like it or not, the force is strong with this trilogy that, honestly, is way better than the prequel trilogy. Since the first film premiered 42 years ago there have been people hating on it and it will never change. I'm glad that I can say that I find pleasure in all of them. No matter what others say, Star Wars films are watched with the heart and not with the mind. Remember that. If you hated it, it's okay, but please don't try to ruin it for the minority of people who actually enjoyed it. Thank you!",0
2628,6.0,"Episode IX felt like a rushed chaotic patchwork of sorts. A course-correction made out of a desperate attempt to appease the critics and save the franchise. Unfortunately, I don't think it worked. The entire trilogy is a mess at this point, and it's been massively mishandled. There are (of course) many aesthetically pleasing things to enjoy about this movie, and the performances are fun and quite entertaining. And as always, the score is tremendous. But as a satisfying conclusion to the saga this falls very short. It never had a chance to truly reach it's potential after the crippling effect of TLJ and Rian Johnson's shenanigans. I don't envy the overwhelming task that JJ had on his hands. Star Wars is a machine like no other. But there was simply too much to resolve in a way that felt natural. It's a very commendable attempt, but TROS was always doomed with the disjointed and shambolic creative team behind this franchise. At best, it's a visually pleasing fun watch with a good score.

Half of it was retconning parts of The Last Jedi for damage control to please the fanbase that hated it, and the other half was explaining the convoluted plot.

I just watched a +2hours of tiktok clips, that just happened to be all about Star Wars..if it were clips of fans I would be raving about it, but it is a billion dollar studio that created this garbage and sells it as if they are the rightful descendant of the Jedi and share our love..I did not see any care and love, but truly saw the dark side.",0

2683,1.0,If you are a child you will probably enjoy this since it doesn't take much to impress kids like Zilla 98.

2685,5.0,"Let me start by saying I disliked TFA and simply HATED TLJ. So I had zero expectations, even animosity as I had read spoiler free reviews and with critics in general rating this THE worst of the new trilogy.<br /><br />So as I got through the first 30 minutes I found myself liking it. From then on I let go of my hate and got into it. Not to say that there were not plot holes and story inconsistencies created by the other 2 movies but it moved at a great pace. Now I have read that there was to much fan service, this is true. It was to desperate to be all inclusive and have every movie represented in someway. I actually didn't mind what they did with Rey and Ren despite my never warming to them in the other movies. The Palpitine story line was questionable and left me wondering how and why.<br /><br />This movie was a surprise to me but also confusing at times with all to convenient tie ups.<br /><br />Its NOT a 1 or a 10. Ignore those. Take it from someone who slaughtered TLJ at every opportunity.",0

My wife and daughter really seemed to enjoy this movie, and I let that color my impressions unabashedly. Babu Frik, Lando, Kylo Ren's opening rampage; there were moments I got into because of the people sitting with me. On that basis, it falls in line with J.J. Abrams' usual passable blockbuster, and on this particular Sunday morning, it wasn't bad.",0
2706,5.0,"Evidently upset by Rian Johnson's contribution to the series in The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams has returned to the Star Wars universe to set the record straight, often directly contradicting the plot points and character arcs set in motion by the preceding film. That makes for an awkward sort of arm wrestling competition, as Johnson himself often seemed intent upon bucking the conventions established by earlier chapters in the franchise. In other words, ""you undid my work, now I'm going to undo yours."" The result, in this case, is an overstuffed mammoth of a film that tries to do too much while also, somehow, accomplishing very little. Not the first time a Skywalker film has been messy, but the lack of enthusiasm and excitement is certainly new. Even in the much-maligned prequels, there was something unique and special about seeing a Star Wars movie. This time, despite the enormous budget, eight films' worth of lead-in, tons of new environments and alien races, plus constant callbacks to please the die-hards, the final product is rather bland and pedestrian. And that's probably the most damning thing I could say about it. This isn't the grand conclusion to a generations-long space epic, it's just a nondescript, run-of-the-mill science fiction shelf-filler with a billion-dollar sheen. It's a mass of writer's room concepts, tossed into a tumbler and belched out onto the screen without much connective tissue. Episode IX does have successful moments. The law of averages says, given enough options, something's bound to stick. Yet, even when they hit upon a winner, Abrams and company's lack of conviction, their reluctance to take a risk and get firmly behind any one direction, lessens the meaning of the whole. How disappointing that it's come to this.",0

It felt like I knew the whole movie the moment it started. LITERALLY nothing caught me off guard. None of the characters were that interesting, pretty much all of the acting was very stale (Adam Driver was fine tho), and WAY too much nostalgia bait left a bad taste in my mouth. Only giving this a two because, at times, it's an incredibly beautiful film (esp in the final act). To sum up why this film was made, I'll leave you with a quote from Jake Paul, child exploitation: ""Buy that merch"".",0

2715,1.0,"I wish the delorean from back to the future was an actual thing, but instead of marty mcfly owning it, the original cast of the star wars movies should own it. Then they should go to the future and watch this rubbish for the first time, and realize how horrendous it is. Then they will make a blood oath and to swear they will never make the star wars movies becasue they know that if they don't create the star wars movies, then this movie will never be a thing. Even though that the original star wars movies are really good and that it would be a sad world without star wars, it will still be a better world then a world where this is a movie.",0
2716,8.0,"Worthy effort, but to a point. This film felt like you were on an adventure. The acting was well pursued, as was the timing. JJ abs had a huge gap to fill and with this he cleared some things up. I personally could of held out another year to explore certain things better but overall felt satisfied with what tools they had and time allowed.

I was like one of the few people who had gone ""haters gonna hate"" and stuff, but this movie - it's like a plan B, a second Death Star, to destroy all support in the fans who wanted some consistency.",0
2718,1.0,Wow i can't believe what they did with the last 3 episode. Nothing like the og and the prequels. It's a total disgrace for the franchise AND rey is not a Skywalker end of story.,0
2719,1.0,"The worst and mediocre end to a great franchise. There are more holes in the film than in the previous one. Yes, of course, he will receive an Oscar for gays and lesbians. I personally believe that there are a lot of Golden Raspberries. The film does not answer your questions.<br /><br />Ryan Johnson can easily breathe out and pass the burden on to JJ Abrams. To give out such a lousy project, you really need to try. Admit, The Last Jedi was, to put it mildly, a controversial episode. 'Skywalker. Sunrise 'outdid his predecessor with a huge margin. Errors were not fixed, they were only supplemented. This film literally consists of mistakes, everything is so simple, naive and childish, as if you are looking at the game of kids in the sandbox, there is no special mind there. Decide for yourself on which episode the saga ended for you personally, but you should not finish it on Skywalker. Sunrise ', and it's best not to even see this ending, it will be easier. The real draft work of the tired creators of expensive fiction, which poses as a full-fledged product. Unfortunately, I voluntarily paid my money for it. If you also want to pay money for a portion of the negative, then it's more likely for the premiere.",0

2721,7.0,Overall I walked out of the theater liking the movie and with a good feeling.

2722,4.0,"JJA should never have been allowed near this title. Total disregard for canon, very rushed and shallow storyline, I feel he was targeting 8 year old boys with ADHD when he directed this. The worst thing about rushing everything is that he then wastes at least 30mins desperately portraying the utterly implausible Finn as the greatest human in the universe. boyega is another that shouldn't have been anywhere near this title, but of course he's perfect for JJA who should probably do the next pacific rim as it's clearly much more his level. Thank goodness Mandalorian is there to save star wars from this ridiculous movie.",0

The script which was ultimately so unoriginal, that lacked courage and artistic risks, and instead replaced them with incredibly complicated but meaningless story lines (bring along a genealogy expert to this film if you ever hope to make sense of the relations between all the characters), and with high paced endless action sequences more reminiscent of a Fast and Furious movie.",0
2726,1.0,I think this must be what a complete fan service movie looks like. JJ destroyed everything he tried to build in The Force Awakens. The movie felt so forced and cringy almost every minute of it.,0

2733,8.0,Overall a very satisfying ending however I do really wish that Ben was still alive. As much depth as Rey had as a character Kylo Ren / Ben really was a character a could empathize with.

This movie basically destroys all the sequel trilogy and all of what the last Jedi proposed. It has a really simple plot and the dialogues sound like if a child wrote them. It's fast, really fast and they bombard all the info and what everything ""really was"" in minutes. The ending is the worst ending that Star Wars could have had and it doesn't make any sense. I'm not a hater in any ways, I love Star Wars and since the new movies came out I'd always been there showing my support and faith, but this movie surpassed all the levels of mediocrity and completely destroyed the saga. I will not tell you ""Don't go to watch the movie"" because I think you must go through the experience, this is just a warning and a psychological preparation for you.

2749,10.0,"Finally watched it, in IMAX 3D. The experience was mind-blowing right from the moment the Lucasfilm logo showed up on screen and soon, the score I wanted to hear in cinemas, played. This was my first experience of a Star Wars film on the big screen.",1

Most fan theories were met and I guess this impacts a lot of people and makes the movie boring. But there's only so much Abrams could've done. I loved this movie because it reminded me of why I like star wars. The music was amazing and the non stop action was brilliant. But it took me back to when I was child playing with lightsabers in the back yard. I don't like star wars because it's an award winning movie series. I like it because it is fake. It is an escape and it allows us to live in a world of sci-fi dreams. Lazer swords, space ships, robots, and planets. George Lucas created a universe of escape and in this last movie, I found redemption. I found escape. For the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes I was in a dream world and it had my emotions all over the place. That is Star Wars.<br /><br />I'm sorry most fans are upset because they're opinions on what should've happened weren't met.

I must admit, people talking behind us took me out of it somewhat, and I had to yell at them to shut up. I'm sure I'll enjoy it more on a rewatch, but overall its still a very good movie.

This movie has something that the latter have been missing; Emperor Palpatime. A wonderful return! I've missed him in the latest movies. Why not bring him back? He belongs in the Star Wars universe! I have missed the emperor, because he is the ultimate villain. This helps in the story, and makes the fronts so clear. Here he is absolutely central again, and as always has the plans ready. I actually think they have manage to bring him back in a credible way. And he does not disappoint this time either, the closing fight is wonderful.

It's sad because the second film that Rian Johnson (writer/director of ""Knives Out"") wrote and directed was pretty good which made JJ jealous enough to slam Johnson in the press. JJ is the ultimate proof that as long as you dazzle them in the room, you can be wildly successful in spite of your mediocrity.",0

2775,6.0,It's disjointed and rushed in places but still has the Star Wars elements fans love to see.

And the one before this was also great! And so was the one before that! I think it's time to stop all the negativity surrounding each Star Wars movie that comes out. People forget that ""movies"" are fun. People forget how it was in the past, when everything was so much simpler... Sit down, let go, enjoy the flick, and get amazed by what the film makers have to offer. Stop complaining, stop being constantly disappointed. You're only hurting yourself, and also contributing for the early demise of your favorite franchises. I'm giving Episode IX a big fat 10 out of 10, only because this is exactly what a movie should be: Entertaining from start to end. You want to complicate and compare it to other Star Wars movies that you watched when you were 12 and got blown away like never before?!? You think every day of your marriage will be exactly the same as your wedding day? You expect every movie to be a boring and outdated cinematographic ""masterpiece"" like Citizen Kane or ""The Godfather""? If that's where you're at, then you're better off just sticking to re-watching those ""classics"" over and over again and please stay away from movie theaters playing new and exciting content, because you'll obviously never be happy or pleased - you'll remain sad and lonely - as you are now - and worse of all, you'll contaminate the public opinion with your sad, lonely, narrow, pseudo-intelectual point of view, and that my friends, is really what hurts the most.",1

2790,1.0,"This movie is honestly laughable, Thank you Disney for this amazing comedy movie 🤡🤡 i walked out the theatre's after 30 minutes. I miss George Lucas but honestly Star Wars fans deserve this.. you didn't like the prequels well now this is what you get",0
2791,9.0,"I'm a seventies baby, so was raised on original trilogy and loved them. I even loved the prequels but they were missing the originals humour and swagger (mainly Han Solo!). I also didn't enjoy the complete CGI, as it often felt cartoonish. I was buzzing when new trilogy was announced, especially JJ Abrams directing (loved Lost, MI3, new Star Trek) and Kasdan (and Pegg!) co-writing. I loved Force Awakens. Mixing new characters with old and new ideas with nostalgic moments pitched it perfect for me. I didn't mind the end being similar to new hope. I loved bits of Last Jedi but not of the film in it's entirety. I want new ideas and surprises but it was completely missing nostalgia. I understand what Rian Johnson was trying to do but he should've saved the 'taking star wars in a new direction' for his new trilogy and not for the generation spanning (42 years!!!) Skywalker saga. What made Force Awakens so good was the new characters and their chemistry and this was completely missing in Last Jedi. Loved scene where Kylo killed Snoke but felt let down when it finished without Rey and Kylo joining hands. For a director aiming to be new, this then contradicted what went before and the remainder of film was a bit flat. It also meant overall it was confusing and disappointed. It was like he was reigned in by Disney when they realised he was changing too much of the spirit of star wars. Therefore, I feel like Rise of Skywalker is more of a sequel to Force Awakens and I'm left gutted at what a JJ Abrams trilogy could/would've been if he'd written and produced the full trilogy and not necessarily directed all 3. The original trilogy had 3 different directors but George Lucas wrote and produced all three. However, I still loved Rise of Skywalker and left with a warm glow in my heart and a big smile on my face. It flew by but I didn't feel like there was too much to take in. Some bits were rushed and other bits too much crammed in but I expected this being that I believe JJ was almost cramming 2 episodes into one. Tying up 9 films was a big task but would've been easier had he been given the full trilogy to do so. What I enjoyed most about Force Awakens was now back in Rise and this was the new characters chemistry. This also provided the humour, which returned with Force Awakens. I loved the Palpatine twist re Rey and despite it being obvious this didn't play out as JJ originally planned in his loose outline for the trilogy. The Sith temple was a bit too CGI for me but the Kylo and Rey dynamic completely overshadowed it and made for a great final act. The Rey and Kylo characters were very well written and the actors performances completely delivered. I believe Rey's character will be influential on my daughter when she's old enough to watch these films. What a great female role model. However, my favourite character is Finn and despite him having more to do in Rise than in Last Jedi, he was still underused and wanted more about his history. Boyega has so much charisma and screen presence and is at the heart of the chemistry dynamics and the film's most humourous moments. Two of Chewbacca's scenes provided the most emotion for me and getting Hans new hope medal was a great touch. I also had a very bug smile when Rey named herself as Skywalker... ive adopted my children and they have my name, which will help them really relate to Rey's story. Fitting end for the saga in my opinion but also personally 😊",1

She also believes ""The Force is female"".<br /><br />As for this film, words fail in describing how horrifically offensive this is to the Star Wars story. It's just stupid fan fiction.

Most important it's the fight of the first order that is the main theme. With Rey once again the main hero lead character. The film is also a journey of the Resistance with Rey still in training to use the force.

The Rise of Skywalker is my favourite movie out of the sequel trilogy because Rey showed the horrible people who hate this movie that you don't have to be genetically related to someone to share their surname. I know only Nazi's or Fascists hate this movie, if you aren't a Nazi please watch it you won't be disappointed. I proudly spend 13 hours a day on Twitter tweeting like a bird with the mind of God and I can proudly say all my Twitter friends agree Rise of Skywalker is the best movie ever.

I am not saying Avengers is the best but it had a good story ark and that did reflect well. Star Wars should have had the main villain pulling the strings from the beginning and have a more proper story ark.

2855,10.0,"Despite JJ Abrams' track record as one of the most talented filmmakers in Hollywood today, nobody could have anticipated the triumph that The Rise of Skywalker is. When A New Hope was released in the late 70's, it brought the world of knight films and westerns into a space environment, generating a passion among young filmgoers that lives to this day. The Empire Strikes Back added the War genre (in particular with its famous opening scene), the Martial Arts genre (through Yoda and his training) and of course a dash of soap opera or tragedy, depending on who you ask. Then nothing. For 30 years, despite multiple attempts. The Force Awakens revived a universe that was dead in a rarely before seen resuscitation tour de force. But it came short of inventing a new genre. The Last Jedi was a mere intermediate step, aimed at setting-up a few pieces for this extraordinary finale, and JJ Abrams was more than happy to delegate its execution to the competent artisan Ryan Johnson. With The Rise of Skywalker, JJ Abrams brings a new genre to space, that of the mythical legend, and by doing so, injects new life into a saga that was feeling completely out of steam. He creates a world where the line between life and death is blurry, where spirits and humans co-exist, and passions cross. He elevates the character of Palpatine (always a weak character in all previous SW films) to the rank of myth, and gives it a meaning that spans the entire saga (unexpectedly turning the saga into the story of the rise and fall of Palpatine). In elevating Star Wars to a true legendary myth (an aspiration that was always there, but could never before have been taken seriously), he extends the boundaries of space itself (creating a new world of the Sith) and reinvents the very nature of space, allowing characters to fly through it at unprecedented speed (never before had we seen the pace of travel visible in this film) and even reinventing the very concept of space, allowing characters in different spaces to interact, touch each other or fight, which is also a true cinematic innovation (and the most extraordinary special effect in the movie, without the use of any special effect to deliver it). And all of it delivered through continuous entertainment at neck breaking speed (it is hard to remember a film recently that felt this action-packed, frantic from minute one until its very end), and some of the most beautiful and creative images that we have ever seen on film in this galaxy.",1

Spectacle is huge but the same seen thousands times, and has almost zero emotional, or adrenaline factor, simply because it's badly built, and you couldn't care less for the characters involved. Movie is too fast, with too little development, and full of playcards characters. Force is treated like wizardry, no more, no less, and there are plenty of fantasy elements that belong to Lord of the rings realm, not Star Wars. What you get in the end is speed-of-light-fast parade of fan service scenes and -very- bad fan fiction, from a director who once again proved not have a personal vision to convey through these movies.",0

This one however is an absolute waste of time, i rather see again Space Balls or a sequel to that. The script was written by children with very low IQ. They took a script for Nickelodeon they dumb it up and named it Star Wars.<br /><br />3 stars for some of the CGI but that's all.",0

But the second half was entertaining enough that I left the theater feeling it was better than I had initially feared. Though that's hardly praise because I doubt I'll be watching it again soon. As apart of the sequel trilogy I felt the series was inconsistent as a whole, and this one proved that. If they really wanted too, they could easily do X XI XII. The ending doesn't prevent future episodes.",0

Completely ludicrous plot points, constantly hopping around with zero pacing because they know if they give the audience one second to breathe and think about the story, they'd realize how stupid and nonsensical it was. None of the character beats are earned and instead Abrams spends the entire film retconning things from The Last Jedi and acting as a mea culpa to the butthurt toxic Star Wars manchilds who couldn't deal with TLJ.

Disney ""learned"" their lesson and made this one more edgier. Why?!? God why?!? You screwed up this bad Disney. A Star Wars movie isn't good unless it tells a story and is fun. Like Solo or Rogue One but no this movie wasn't fun it was predictable and dry and had virtually nothing new to offer. It is a disappointment and a money making cheap scam.

THE LAST JEDI was a polarizing film, as director Rian Johnson seemingly threw out the groundwork J.J. Abrams laid in the first film, and took the franchise in a different direction, and in the process, seemed to enjoy confounding the expectations of devoted fans. This was true right from the start in the opening scene of JEDI, when an aged Luke Skywalker tosses away his light saber right after Rey had traveled far to give it back to him.",1

I FINALLY watched it and at home, FULLY expecting to be disappointed. Was definitely NOT disappointed at all. I'll never forget the original, saw it in the theatre and thought WOW!! I would compare it to the Wonder Woman movie with Gal Gadot for some girl power and my guess is these idiots who gave it a 1, 2, or 3, some cannot even spell, or didn't even watch it (sheep) only wanted sexy women as one put it or or male dominance. There are some great references to things like hatred/bigotry, subtly done. LOVED the twists and don't want to ruin anything, so certain characters change of heart/struggle with decisions. Don't we all have that. Have seen all Star Wars movies in theatres, except this one, and I go to the theatre a lot, and wish I had seen it in December at the movies. I will watch it again, and rarely do that with most movies, but worth seeing again to catch anything I may have missed. Daisy Ridley was great, as were most of the performances, in different ways, some understated. Almost gave it a 10 but I rarely do that. Yes, you should watch this movie!!!!",1

That being said I loved this movie. Like really really loved it. I hope they make more.

2887,10.0,"Pretty much perfect escapism film making and fixing what gone before. The Rise of Skywalker helps you forget the dumpster fire of The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi was 10% Star Wars, 40% poor action scenes, 50% nonsense that did nothing for the story. JJ Abrams took that 10% and built upon it forgetting the Rian Johnson nonsense and showing how action scenes should be done. JJ Abram is more of an action director than epic story teller so the bias is more towards that than plot of the Lucas films.",0
2888,7.0,"I am a huge SW fan, and as TFA was underwhelming and TLJ made me absolutely furious, I went into seeing this movie with no expectations at all, niether reading or whatching anything about the movie beforehand. And thank god i did so. I was actually able to enjoy it.<br /><br />No, it's not a fantastic movie and no, it does not satisfy my true SW heart. But it was solid. It has a few holes, it has, 'wait what really?' moments and it pushes the limit of the universe a few times in teams of what i'm willing to accept as a SW fan. But with that said, it doesn't do so in the same heartbreaking degree as TLJ did, and on top og that, it actually brought in a few things that made me feel excitement and that left me with some sort of overall satisfaction storywise. JJ Abrams had a difficult task fixing the mess that TLJ left behind, and i think he did well.",1

Avengers Endgame was amazing and had a good finale but this.... This has been going on for over 40 years and I expected better. It was really predictable and boring. Just end Star Wars cause it's way part it's due date.,0
2892,10.0,"This movie isn't perfect. I'll be honest. I'm giving it a 10 to balance out haters. But seriously, it's not a Christopher Nolan or mind bending thriller. It's STAR WARS. Nostalgia, history, action and exploration at its finest. I loved it and I had so much fun. Go see it with people who love Star Wars. It was a special experience and my favorite of the trilogy. Don't take yourself or the movie so seriously and you're gonna have a great time.",1
2893,,"J.J. Abrams is a good director. In a way he can direct a movie, not write a script. He did an acceptable job with ""Force Awakens"" by copy pasting ""New Hope"" and adding Emo Ren and Mary Sue to the mix, but that's about it.",0
2894,1.0,"Did not like this film at all. Sloppy storytelling with no heart and soul. Incomprehensible script and plot that tries to rush and tell everything that the last Jedi failed to do while also ending the whole trilogy in only a couple hours. With Palpatine coming back, the story also destroys the legacy and impact of Luke and Vader destroying the empire. What a disaster. This is not what Star Wars deserves. The whole trilogy is a letdown and an insult to the original cast and Star Wars fans alike.",0
2895,8.0,I've never experienced a more divided fan base than that of Star Wars. It is important to go into this film with an open mind and be ready to go on an adventure. This film is fantastic. 2hrs 20 minutes that absolutely flew by and I cannot wait to see it again. Just because it's not what you wanted does not make it terrible. It is packed with unexpected twists and turns and an extremely satisfying ending. It has some beautiful shots that scream Star Wars.,1
2896,10.0,"What a fantastic end to the saga, it wasn't too obvious and predictable and had all the right ingredients for a truly classic Star Wars film. I was gripped to my seat the whole time and thought it couldn't have been done any better. J.J.Abrams is a truly visionary director! The force will be with you, always!",1
2897,1.0,"At 42 years since the first film, it's now time to call in the Star Wars world. It over. Ruined. A small decline that started on Return of the Jedi, was made worse by Lucas returning with the new films, raised hope in The Force Awakens, to a drop in the following film, now the games up in this last one. The Last Jedi is basically ignored, this is a corporate film, to make as much money as possible. It may fail though, I can't see people returning to watch it many times.<br /><br />Very annoying plot holes, hux as a spy, emporers granddaughter, people dead-alive-dead-alive, make your mind up, secret maps to places(why?).",0

2899,10.0,The film is a fantastic send off and would watch over and over,1
2900,8.0,"First of all, I do understand why people would hate this movie. But you may want to try to see the movie and expect nothing. And, most important of all, forget the other two ""trilogy"" parts. To be honest, the mess that ""The Last Jedi"" created was nearly impossible to clean up while doing the final part of a trilogy. So, let us start all over and consider ""The Rise of Skywalker"" as a stand-alone movie. And accept that this is a magical fairy-tale world in which, well, 10000 Star Destroyers can rise out of nothing.",1
2901,5.0,"So I think alone this movie is good. You could probably chop this story up and make it three movies with a great rise fall and conclusion. But it's not a trilogy. It's the last movie in one. They embark on a movie that has a totally different plot and direction than the first two movies in the trilogy and just hope everyone loves it because it's Star Wars. Again, I thought this movie is fine. It felt like if you were watching the original trilogy and at the beginning of the ROTJ the crawl said ""Darth Malak has returned and now Darth Vader and Luke hunt for answers"" and instead of a conclusion to the story you were building up to you get another one that by all means sounds cool but wouldn't be as satisfying as the one that was planned. It seems like a hollow victory. Yay! We won but ... what did we win? The emperor came back, which was introduced in a commercial and then that was the plot for the entire movie. It felt like damage control, and as a person that HATES the Last Jedi, I felt disappointed. I'm glad they listened to the fans because whether you like it or not, those hardcore fans people love complaining about are the reason why Star Wars is still here. Their voices SHOULD be heard. But the problem was is that Disney let Rian Johnson change fundamental parts of the story they were going to tell and when JJ got his hands on it the only option was to embark on a new story. All in all, I didn't leave the theater mad, but I left very disappointed.",0
2902,1.0,This was literally 20 mini stories tied up into 2 hours. The phantom menace was more entertaining,0
2903,9.0,"No Spoilers.<br /><br />Maybe a solid 8 rating, but I gave it 10 to counteract anyone who gave it 1. Those people clearly didn't want to like it from the start.<br /><br />A true fan will love TROS.<br /><br />You'll find all the answers you're looking for, especially some of the more controversial bits from TLJ. Abrams has managed to tie it all together surprisingly well.<br /><br />A great story in its' own right, but with so many Easter eggs too.<br /><br />There's subtle jab about treating the Jedi's weapon with some respect, and even a great 'Life Day' nod to the terrible Christmas special.<br /><br />If you've grown up with Star Wars and loved it, just go see it.",1
2904,4.0,Not worth the hype. Awful movie with a bad storyline. The old movies we're so much better with structure.,0
2905,3.0,"Unnecessary loud music and sightfull pictures try to cover the idealess story.<br /><br />They brought down these legendary movies for the level of soap operas.<br /><br />Palpatine has grandchild who is stronger than Yoda. Generally the ladies like the bad boys, however honestly who would like to ""sleep"" with Palpatine?<br /><br />After this very funny to see the reactions of the fans who saw the final trailer 2-4 months ago. Shame.<br /><br />I think the most of SW collectors will sell they collection as soon as possible.",0
2906,5.0,The movie seemed cramped with so much details that weren't completely finished. almost a rush to theaters to complete a jumbled plot which made more questions than it should for a final film.,0

2908,5.0,"I wish I wish they had just taken longer and made us wait and had written better stories for this trilogy it's worst then the last Jedi! Haha what how! I'm sad I'm hurt as a Star Wars fan. This was there time to redeem it and make it wow amazing. And the worst part is since it wants to all fall in order with all episodes it kinda just affects episodes 1-6, I know what your gonna say ""no a true fan would just forget 7-9"" what? NO how? If it's all canon and goes together now when ever I see episodes 1-6 it's gonna be like ugh I know where all this goes to so there's no point! Damnit they literally ruin Star Wars for me.",0
2909,2.0,Just a very short one for this. This is a lame movie and a very boring and dissatisfying end to the series. It was stupid and it stayed true to the Mary Sue of the last two episodes.,0
2910,1.0,The Rise of Skywalker is a beautifully crafted romp which completely ignores lore established by George Lucas. The entire Disney sequel trilogy is entirely unnecessary. We already got a satisfactory ending of the Skywalker saga with Return of the Jedi.

2911,5.0,"Wow, what a mess... but a fitting ending to this botched trilogy. Well done, JJ and Rian Johnson, you made the prequel trilogy look masterpieces compared to this garbage. These guys... While Rian has vision, it's not true to Star Wars, and JJ is just a hack without any vision whatsoever so he just copies and pastes everything from earlier movies. I'm so tired of seeing the same ideas, visuals and scenes over and over again. Oh, and Disney, how on Earth is it possible that there wasn't a definitive arc for the trilogy? I'm just baffled by this level of incompetence.",0
2912,2.0,Totally unoriginal and tedious........,0
2913,8.0,"This movie was very entertaining. I think JK abrams had a solid vision for the Star Wars direction, but rian johnson messes with it with last Jedi. I love the dynamic between Ben and Rey and I love the backstory behind them. However, the movie felt rushed and didn't capitalize on some potentially emotional scenes. Ben was kind of thrown in the garbage at the end of the movie. There was no sense of respect for him from Rey at the end. He saved her, she kissed him, he died, and then it was almost as if Rey forgot about him and his memory. He disappeared as a Jedi and that was it. Too sudden for one of the top 2 most important characters. A simple force reunion at the end with Luke and leia would have sufficed.",1
2914,1.0,"Like all things that disney acquires , it ruined. This movie sucks. I was really looking forward seeing Palpatine again. But the movie felt flat, has no charisma. Its just a dead hollow script with bad acting. Disney believes they can just slap a Star Wars title to it an go.",0
2915,9.0,It was 1977 and I was scheduling films at college and the company that handled Fox asked if I would be willing to tag a teaser trailer on our film that week. I said no problem. When it ran on the screen I was immediately hooked. Who would have thought that 43 years later I'd still be enjoying the adventures of the STAR WARS films?,0
2916,6.0,I'm unsure why this is currently the lowest scored of Disney's efforts at Star Wars (main storyline ones) as it's easily the best. I appreciate that's not saying much as the previous two had set the bar pretty low. The cringe-worthy forced banter early on had me thinking this was going the same way but it improved into a passable effort. This is also the first time I've seen cgi good enough to pass for human in Leia. The effects were never going to be in doubt to be fair. It was always the script and acting quality that was the potential for disaster as per the previous two. A better job was done here though it could and should have been much better still.,0
2917,3.0,...And then some! It was hard to get through the whole thing. A fitting ending for a terrible trilogy. Star Wars deserves better.,0
2918,1.0,"This movie had some good, some bad, and a lot of ugly. The pace of the movie was a bit all over the place, disregarding many key details like, how did Palpatine survive the fall and where was a flashback showing this? How did Palpatine create Snoke? Who is this Sith cult and where did they originate? Who was Palpatine's son and who was his mother? How was every Sith's spirit put into Palpatine? The ending of this movie was a cop out and a rush to just end the trilogy, how does an evil genius like Palpatine just let his face get melted off by his own force lightning instead of stopping and pulling out his lightsaber or using a different technique? There should have been an epic three way lightsaber duel between Palpatine, Rey, and Kylo where Kylo has to sacrifice himself so that Rey can take Palpatine out or they should have just left Palpatine out all together and went with Darth Plagueis being the antagonist, reviving himself after Palpatine's death in Return of the Jedi. All in all The Last Jedi was so garbage that it must have been very difficult to piece things back together for this film and that has to be taken into consideration.",1

I've awarded 6/10 purely because Driver and Ridley have lifted this trilogy into 'good' on their own. Take them out, and ROS is a mess from start to finish. As much as it is taboo to say so, the Fisher scenes do not work. Williams has forgotten how to act. Poe and Finn serve no purpose to the plot (NOT Isaac's or Boyega's fault). There are plot holes the size of Death Star II. There are twenty McGuffins that make no sense. Cowardly decisions not to kill off major characters that may have actually lent a semblance of consequence for Rey. And of course the ludicrous finale with a billion Star Destroyers up against a rag tag of ships wandering into Exegol like the finale of 1917. Thank God for Reylo and their scenes at the end. Adam and Daisy take a bow 6/10.",0
2922,,"I suspect to create the overall story arc for these prequel movies they played that game, the one where someone writes a secret word or sentence on a folded bit of paper, then someone else adds another secret word or sentence on another fold and so on. Unfolding the paper reveals the incoherent scribblings of different trains of thought and they said ""We got it!"" and then went on and made the movies based on that. At least that's my general feeling that this is how they ended up with this abomination of a Star Wars movie. Three sequel movies with zero cohesive story, each worse than the last. At least the first two felt mostly like a Star Wars movie in tone. This one feels like 7 episodes of the A-Team edited together to make a movie. And that's the 3 movie end to the saga. What a gut punch.",0

You could substitute one character for another and it would make no difference. The characters in this StarWars are not even a pale copy of the originals; it's a failure in that regard.<br /><br />The wonders of digitalization aside, I pondered ""How they could get those words to come out of the mouth of the deceased Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia)?"" Tfhen I realized ""Of course, they're just generic phrases. Her scene was likely performed for a previous sequel, picked up from the cutting room floor and used here."" Much of the dialogue/story is like that. It's a movie devoid of interesting characters, but maybe that's because the dialogue is vapid. So, dialogue is another thing that sets it apart from the originals; it's bland and cliched.<br /><br />The original took stock stories from Saturday morning cowboy shows and Saturday matinees and placed them in a galaxy far far away. Then, proceeded to make it all new. Today's StarWars galaxy is worn out.

2933,7.0,"I never saw the leaks (hallelujah), and I think whoever it was that leaked the movie should be fired, because they're the ones that caused this HUGE fiasco between the fans.<br /><br />In all honesty, it wasn't perfect. The first half, yes, was mostly just plot hole fixes from Rian's film, but the second half I felt like it paid off fairly well. I did enjoy moments of fan service, and I didn't feel like it was overused.<br /><br />The script was...interesting. They could have done things better with that.",0
2934,7.0,"The people who have rated this film really low like a 1/10 or a 2/10 expected this film to be the best film of the year, ending the biggest saga in the world with a strong plot and acting like endgame. But if you have seen the force awakens and especially the last Jedi then you would be smart enough to realise that these sequels were not going to be anywhere near as good as the classic ones.",1
2935,9.0,The best sciences fiction movie of 2019. This is a great movie. It has great acting. It also has great special effects. It also has a great story line. It is not an 8 out of 10. That is underrating it. It is a 9 out of 10,1
2936,1.0,Entertaining in the sense that it is fun to watch a slow motion car crash.,1
2937,1.0,"Straight to the point<br /><br />Serious this two were in love<br /><br />Star Wars meant to be realistic about battle space and galactic governor theories, but then?? serious all that sunset! and Oxigen? I believe we should really think this is ""The Room"" of bad ending Sagas in movie industry<br /><br />Ren should have died, but murder by Rey, she should turn to the dark side, instead the time spend watch the rest was a total waste to see<br /><br />JJ Abrams, stop play with toys, your are already what?40??",0
2938,9.0,"Don't believe cry babies and haters. This is Star Wars as it should have been from Episode VII on. Loved it. Exquisite cinematography, music, space battles and lightsaber choreography. JJ has achieved the impossible. Sure it has its flaws but great great great ending to the New Trilogy and the Skywalker Saga.",1
2939,3.0,"The last trilogy is just a mockery of the Star Wars franchise. They have ignored all the important parts of the first 6 movies, including the prophecies. They make all the old characters weak and the Jedi individuality as just something anyone can have.",0
2940,8.0,"I went and watched in the mindset of being a glutton for punishment. However, I actually enjoyed it. Yep there are bits which I was hoping they'd be brave about but weren't. I like how they managed Carrie Fisher being dead. I don't think they have an easy way of delivering a perfect movie. Many people will be watching the movie with an idea of how the saga should have gone forward, what they wanted the characters to develop into and when they don't they are disappointed. I went and watch the Last Jedi opening night and haven't watched it again or feel I want to. Watched Force Awakens opening night and felt I was watching a reboot of a new hope. This one I don't feel like that, I feel I will watch again based on its own merits. It looked great, sounded amazing and the story wasn't so bad either.",1
2941,2.0,"The story is bad. This movie's plot actively negates the story arcs of Anakin and Luke Skywalker from the prequel and original trilogy. By bringing back Palpatine - what did Darth Vader sacrifice himself for? He and Luke did not defeat the Emperor after all - so what was the point? The prequels explored the corruption and fall of Anakin Skywalker and the original trilogy examined Luke's quest to redeem his father, and this movie renders all those interesting and deep themes meaningless.",0
2942,2.0,"They've must delete a ton of reviews because I can't believe it has 6.5 points. This movie is nothing. Like an empty box under the Christmas tree. No real story, no nothing just a ton of cringe empty and meaningless scenes.",0
2943,10.0,"I saw this in Xd and I'm giving The Rise of Skywalker a 10 because I believe it's the best Star Wars movie in any format ever! I'm glad it wasn't in 3d,though because 3d need alot of work! I've listened some spoilers but NONE of them were even close in my opinion. The story moved along very well. There were some things that at first didn't fit but were later taken care of nicely. Although there were some old and new characters that weren't expanded on, it wouldn't have changed anything anyway. There some unexpected characters and they were used without adding any unanswered questions. For me it tied up all the loose ends very well.",1
2944,2.0,The review about the dark side winning and Rey being the Mary Sue of the galaxy was the best summary of this movie I've read. And I came away from this last installment realizing how GREAT the ORIGINAL STAR WARS trilogy really was and STILL IS today!!,1
2945,6.0,"Alright here we go. I went in with low expectations after the disappointment that was The Last Jedi (if you like that movie, good on you, I'm glad someone did, just wasn't for me)",0
2946,8.0,It's an amazing journey for every starwars fan because of heart touching characters and storyline with magnificent graphics.... Each nd every character will connect ur heart in such a way u have never imagined....three generations of million fans and their support.... Such a fabulous emotional journey is coming to end.... But it's legacy will be forever... It's not just a movie it's an emotion..,1
2947,4.0,"I went to see this film last night. I don't understand how you can give a 10 to this movie. Sure, if you put your brain on off and haven't seen any other Star Wars movies, this could be a 10. There are so many holes in the scripts, so many inconsistencies with the Star Wars universe, that one can only laugh at the series of events presented.",1
2948,7.0,Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is a very safe approach to the saga. The movie does not offer many surprises or a deep plot. The plot feels also a bit messy and as it has been fast produced during some parts.,1
2949,8.0,"I enjoyed the movie, the effects, and the story. It wasn't amazing, but it was decent. Worth watching. I don't get all the hate for the movie. Fun watch",1
2950,8.0,"As the greatest franchise in cinematic history, it's no understatement to say that bringing the Star Wars saga is a task of monumental proportions. But with passion, spectacle and a deep love for the eight films before it, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker does a mighty fine job, overcoming some narrative wobbles and an often convoluted plot to provide breathtakingly entertaining blockbuster entertainment, and to bring a satisfying conclusion to the legendary saga.",1
2951,10.0,It was phenomenal! I am not going to put spoilers on here. I hated the last Jedi and somehow JJ not only mad this one amazing. He improved the Last Jedi in the process!!!! I mean it is amazing!!!! Go watch it! Anyone who has gone to see it is going to love it!<br /><br />I am going to go see it again!!!<br /><br />I am a die hard Star Wars fan. I went in with low expectations. I was blown away. It was as perfect an ending as you could get following the Last Jedi. Great movie!,1
2952,1.0,JJ not only trashed the story of the first 6 movies as he trashed his own story.,0
2953,9.0,"Firstly, and to be plain: there is no such thing as a perfect film. This is because the whole point of art is that it's subjective.",1
2954,8.0,"1? 1???? Please.... Suddenly everyone is a critic... Why so much hate... It's not 1 neither 10...<br /><br />Star Wars is a intergalactic fairytale. Very entertaining, funny, nostalgic..<br /><br />The point of knowing who you are and who you chose to be no matter of your family's actions or the way you have been raised. Sure there were some cliche scenes but which fairytale doesn't have one. The chemistry of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's is unquestionable. The fights were just epic!! On the climax of the movie I was holding my breath. Palpaltine is the villain we deserve!<br /><br />Rey's handled her visions and her fear of how Vader should have.. that no matter of how hard and tempting things may be if you have strong values in life you can overcome every obstacle.<br /><br />I am sure going to miss it...",1
2955,8.0,"Saw it at midnight, it's a terrible movie objectively, and picking holes in it would be like shooting fish in a barrel, but... damn it was a lot of fun, felt like a Star Wars movie and for brief moments I was a child again.",0
2956,10.0,I thought this movie was beautiful and ended the story perfectly. I guess the negative reviewers wanted a terrible Game of Thrones style ending where everyone dies? Whatever the reason go see this movie with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.,1
2957,4.0,"The plots a mess, some parts are predictable, and just overall underwhelming. The only good things are a couple of cool action scenes and Adam Driver's good acting. Please no more SW films, Disney.",0
2958,10.0,The second movie was a little disappointing since I had high expectations after the first movie. But this had everything that I looked after! The details like Leia had own sable and she fought Luke... I cried when I saw that scene. The ending is great. My father and I went home pretty happy and pleased.,0
2959,8.0,Ignore the one-star troll reviews. These people apparently feel like they were personally victimized by Disney ruining their childhood Star Wars memories.<br /><br />This movie is much better than The Last Jedi. I was highly critical of it. With what Abrams what to work with and what he had to accomplish with this movie I would say he beat my expectations. My biggest criticism would be that it felt rushed in the sense that they were trying to cram so much in one movie. Some of the plot points needed to be addressed more than they were. This movie really needed to be told in two movies.,0
2960,10.0,Don't believe the haters. This movie is legit amazing from start to finish. Great ending to an amazing story. I have spoken.,1
2961,5.0,"Let's just call it Star Wars: Let's Wrap this Up. Say what you will about the last two in the saga, but they had clear, investing stories to tell. To all of those who said that The Last Jedi sucked so hard, hope you enjoy this one, because it was tailor made for you. It plays it safe on every level. It's character development, suffice to say, are hackneyed. Big revelations are presented here that were meant to last a huge impact on the audience, and yet they don't. They sit there. Because at this point, who cares? I didn't hate it. I'm not as emotionally invested in the franchise as many are, so I could find little things to enjoy about this. 2019 was an incredible year for film, but ironically, it produced a wimpy Star Wars installment. But to be sure, I'll take this one over those wretched prequels any day of the week.",1
2962,5.0,Feels as though they didn't know how to pull together threads from the first two films and manufactured a conclusion that didn't quite seem to ring true. Such a shame because The Last Jedi was actually an interesting chapter that felt like it set the sequels up for an interesting conclusion.,0
2963,1.0,Im a massive Stars Wars fan but this hands down the worst film I have ever seen. Someone must of written the script on their lunch break.,0
2964,1.0,"Leia deserved a better send off than 5-6 one-liners that barely fit their scenes. C3PO deserved a better send off than ""taking one last look at my friends"" when Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy were not in the room.",0
2965,8.0,"Having been a fan of Star Wars for 40 years now, I really don't understand the hate that so many people have spewed on this movie already. Is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a fun action packed movie with a lot of awesome moments? YES!!! Im not sure what else a fan could've wanted for the conclusion of this trilogy.",1
2966,2.0,This film is all over the place. It hits the ground running and then falls flat on its face. The acting is good but everything else is bad including the endgame style finale sucks so bad. JJ Abrams really should be ashamed of this film.,0
2967,2.0,"Watching this film it just felt like everyone making this movie was tired of Star Wars and just wanted to end it as fast as possible- so they just did the easiest ending they could think of. If Disney made an episode 10, 11, & 12- you could just skip 7, 8, & 9 and you wouldn't really miss anything -nothing happens in this movie that hasn't already happened in Star Wars before a la the original trilogy.",0
2968,1.0,"Boring, predictable, uninspired, and just disappointing for such an important film. It's pretty much like any other 'blockbuster' of recent years, except with a Star Wars skin on it.",0
2969,4.0,"This has to be the best star wars for me. I grew up on the oringal so those made very high expectations for me. I can say this film delivers in every way, the visuals are absolutely beautiful, the film keeps on giving the audience plenty to stay on the edge of their seats. Loved how they closed all the plot holes from the other two films. This one was a well deserved 10 from me. Loved it and hope you do! And yes please disregard the bad reviews even if you don't give it a 10 like me you will not be disappointed! Not for a second",1
2970,10.0,This movie was so good thank you JJ for coming back and saving the Franchise well done,1
2971,7.0,"No one hates Star Wars as much as Star Wars fans. As usual, this movie isn't as bad as people say it is...especially the fans. I'm not entirely sure what people were expecting, especially after the hatred for The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens followed the formula too closely and The Last Jedi had the balls to shake things up. Love it or hate it, you at least have to admit it. It was different. After that kind of backlash though, seriously what were people expecting? As a cinefile, I enjoyed this movie well enough. I learned a long time ago never to go into to any movie with higher than high expectations. You're just setting yourself up for failure at that point. Star Wars is no exception. It is, at the end of the day, a movie and should treated as such. As with the Prequels, the Sequel Trilogy is (for better or worse) a part of what we know as Star Wars.",0
2972,1.0,"So many plot holes, too numerous to mention.<br /><br />Bad script, bad acting, poor characters, non sensical plot, an insult to moviemaking, human intelligence and star wars.<br /><br />One good thing....try the John Boyega drinking game and down a shot everytime he shouts,""Rey!"".<br /><br />Star wars is dead.....avoid.!!",0
2973,5.0,"Yeah, the first half of the movie they try to explain other 2 movies, and then they screw up the star wars again with other half. No doubt visual was good and for that i rate 5 stars, 0 for story obviously.",0
2974,5.0,"I'm not gonna pretend that the last two movies were masterpieces, but I thought they were solid and passible. Not this one though. JJ Abrams probably thought to himself ""hey, I forgot to develop my characters, so I'll put like one or two sences doing so. Oh yeah, and I'll throw in even more forgettable characters and not develop them."" I do not give a crap about the new characters let alone on main ones. It has the Micheal Bay style of storytelling where action scenes are prioritized over plot and character development. Adimmitatly, some of the action scenes are pretty fun to watch, at least until you realise that's all there is. The plot is just stupid, I feel like I lost a few brain cells. It the most stupid fan fiction anime plot I have ever seen in recent years. This includes plot points such as ""Emperor Palpatine was alive the whole time even though he clearly died in Return of the Jedi"" and ""Kylo Ren dies, but not before giving Rei a kiss."" The only character I genuinely enjoyed watching was C3PO, who was the only one not affected by the zombie apocalypse if you know what I'm saying. Just don't bother with this one, it's not worth anyone's time.",0
2975,9.0,"I have seen all Star Wars Movies and this one was very entertaining and enjoyable. There was action, suspense and the movie was very well plot driven with a climatic ending. I especially enjoyed how the original characters were revisited in cameo appearances. Well done Disney!",1
2976,10.0,"I'll start off to say that I am biased. In 1977 I went to see A New Hope as a 10 year old boy. From the opening score I was hooked and transported into a world that would stay with me now into my early 50s. As a young boy I imagined being part of that world - the trading cards, models of the Falcon and Red 5 X-Wing. As each moving came I could hardly wait in excruciating anticipation. In my 30s the prequels came out. Yes, they were not the same...new characters and the building of the story of Obi-wan and Anakin. Understandably, many felt these movies did not measure up to the nearly impossible expectations of episodes 4-6. Then comes The Force Awakens. Again, new characters introduced and we're led through essentially a passing of e wand to a new generation. So now we close with The Rise of Skywalker. I was blown away. I truly feel it was an epic adventure. I can't adequately relate the excitement and emotions felt through the entire movie. At once a 52 year old man and a 10 year old boy reliving every moment of the galaxy far far away. Tears of joy.",1
2977,10.0,"As a Star Wars fan from the very beginning, I really enjoyed this final episode. Whilst I can understand some of the reviews and critics, my view is of someone who believed the story from the outset and wanted good to prevail over evil. It was good to see all of the old cast appear to give their final words of wisdom. Am I biased...yes...but did I enjoy the film as a real fan, absolutely!!",1
2978,1.0,A waste of money. This film was the worst I've ever seen in the cinema,0
2979,7.0,"Its finally ended.. the longest successful running franchise of all time! Breaks my heart a bit, really. Mostly because it wasn't done as well as you wanted it to be made. The film left me feeling ambiguous .. It lacked the magic of the first trilogy and some parts just didnt make much sense in the longer context of things. On the other hand, some scenes were done soo well and you couldnt have asked for a better ending to character arcs. This balances it out, which sort of salvages the film overall really, but I wont deny that I wanted more. It was a thrill seeing old (but never forgotten faces) on the screen again. John Williams's music as always was amazing and hair raising.",1
2980,9.0,"A lot crammed in to one film but 100% for effort to make up for last abomination that you could safely miss and jump straight to from The Force Awakens.<br /><br />Very little to complain about, would be being picky if I did.",0
2981,1.0,"These last three films were a complete mess, I didn't feel anything at the end of them. No emotion what so ever. The original trilogy Was good story telling with a bit of a surprise that had you feeling excited for the next, the second 3 had their flaws but still excellent execution with the 3rd and final film. There were plot holes and poor story telling in all 3 of the prequels! I grew up one of the biggest Star Wars fans, and when I seen the first trailer for the first prequel movie I was ecstatic! But now I'm just disappointed and want to wash my eyes out. I really hope Disney decides to scratch these three and decide to invite Lucas back in the picture. So disappointed.",0
2982,9.0,I loved this movie and it was similar to the original 3 - Don't hesitate to watch and enjoy it !,1
2983,9.0,"Ignore the mewling fan boys who're upset because it's not exactly how they wanted it, this is stunning. Yes, it's a bit like Star Wars' greatest bits rejigged and rolled into a single movie but it's funny, thrilling, brilliantly acted for the most part, visually stunning and an emotional roller coaster. Never mind the dweebs, any self respecting fan should go and see this immediately.",1
2984,1.0,This is the result of all the people who bashed The Last Jedi complaining about little things that hurt nobody. Rian Johnson made a good movie with some risky moves and respecting the actual Star Wars canon. A lot of people hated it without having solid arguments...,1
2985,8.0,"A Long time ago in a galaxy, far, far, far away George Lucas watched a bunch of Japans films and thought to himself... let's do it in space! Billions of dollars later, 11 films and 2 decades we come to it, the end of all things. Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker. So the reel question is, can this work? Can J.J.Abram's pick up the pieces left off the floor that Rian Johnson blew up or is it too much to ask for even the man who made Mission Impossible awesome?",1
2986,1.0,"I had no expectations for this movie yet it managed to disappoint, no, anger me. Disney destroyed Star Wars once and for all.",0
2987,2.0,"While I just was watching this movie in cinema, I just started to think about any sense of this thing (I had time unfortunately). I found two goals with this movie by J.J. Abrams and his incompetent team:",0
2988,7.0,"Abrams did a fine job wrapping up the series. I went in not reading reviews (and would honestly suggest the same to you). Like most people (less the die-hard fans), I liked most of the Star Wars movies.. some more than the others. This was NOT the best, but certainly NOT the worst of the series. I'd rank it certainly in the upper half.",0
2989,2.0,"Where should I begin? It feels like the writers really haven't seen a single Star Wars movie before this. They are literally breaking every physical rule of the Star Wars universe with pretty much no explaination. Nothing in the past movies have any value at all. Now apparently Death Star ships are a new thing, so anyone can cruise around shooting planets to pieces without much effort (in seconds). So many illogical things and a lot of plot holes. Just consider this a Star Wars comedy fan fiction, they ""Game of thrones""-ed the ending.",0
2990,7.0,"I must say I enjoyed this last movie, although it feels like an Avengers Endgame knockoff. I understand J.J. Abrams had to clean up the mess Rin Johnson did with ""The Last Jedi"" and I believe it succeeded (although not in the best way possible). Rey and Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) had a acceptable character evolution, Emperor Palpatine's return as the main villain was kind of bittersweet and it basically destroys the established prophecy that Anakin Skywalker was the chosen one. But the action, plot twists and incredible cast saved the film from being as bad as the last one. Making it a good but not even close to ""perfect"" ending to the Skywalker Saga. Is just meh.",1
2991,2.0,"The only worth thing in it is that music theme. It was a very bad casting and nobody of them has that needed charisma, NO ONE! The Story? Gimme a break! That connection between Rey and Ren is more than funny. Driver? He isn't for that role from the beginning. Ridley? She is trying. The Rise? I would say The Fall! :(",0
2992,10.0,"Star Wars has always been a Part of my Childhood. Since many Years these Characters and Stories have stayed with me. After seeing the Rise of Skywalker I felt... Emotional like my Heart was filled with so much Joy and Love that I can savely say ❤❤ Love, I love Star Wars. In 1977 George Lucas created a whole new Universe which stayed with us to this Day. I loved every Minute of the Rise of Skywalker. Every Character was great and every Single Moment I felt. Leia, Luke, Han, Lando, Chewbacca and yes even the New Ones like Rey, Poe, Finn, BB8, Rose. And our favourite Droids R2D2 and C3PO. And the Spirit of the Jedi as they are supposed to be have returned.<br /><br />I can'r say more but I can say: People, May the Force be with you and don't Hate, Just Love❤❤",1
2993,8.0,"Going into this film I knew there was going to be split opinions on it but it's not really that bad a film are parts of it rushed definitely, is some of the plot a little hard to believe yeah but what this film does do is give you a 2 hour nostalgia trip about everything star wars is some of it too much yeah but if you try not to think about it and let yourself enjoy the film and worry about the problems with the disney trilogy later but I am glad this is the final chapter in the saga.",1
2994,6.0,It's an okay movie but the whole Palpatine storyline just comes out of knowhere the previous movies didn't build up to it or even acknowledge Palpatine then the story just adds him into the series.,0
2995,2.0,This movie really didn't do any favors to last Jedi because this movie is basically rehashed return of the Jedi.,0
2996,3.0,Thank goodness the skywalker saga has ended. Now we might have a chance of getting a good Star Wars film once again.,1
2997,1.0,"I gave one star for its entertainment value, and I had to watch until the end because I grew up with the trilogy. However this movie's narrative doesn't make any sense. And not like it's an original, disruptive narrative... It Does not make sense in Itself and certainly not within the whole saga... WTF!? The characters' own logic don't even hold, but Hey... ""It was a long time ago in a fallacy far, far away"". I should've stayed with the trilogy.",0
2998,6.0,"The story was all over the place, it had some really good moments and some awful ones too.<br /><br />Very good visuals as you would expect from a mega blockbuster but the plot was pretty bad. It was fast paced and skipped over a ton of details so by the end you're left wondering what the heck just happened.",0

3004,3.0,"That is all it was a remake of the original trilogy, Not only this movie but all the so called sequel trilogy , but it isn't an actual remake so they undo everything from the original to do it again in these sequels , but hey they have a good CGI oooohhh.",0
3005,4.0,We all know how the latest star wars trilogy has been. Its been like a mixed bag of beans blended and later on dipped in a strange substance.,0
3006,9.0,"As a fan since the original in 1977, this is a great ending to the saga. Dont listen to the negative comments, they dont know what they are talking about. This is very nostalgic and beautifully executed. Bravo!",1
3007,9.0,"I have never been a huge fan of Star Wars, but this one just won me over. I love Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, the only one I didn't like was the over acting of Daisy Ridley, so annoying. But the story lines were just great. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job. Unlike other Star Wars movies where the scenes were so dark, you couldn't even see them, just hate that. This was very bright and artsy. My husband and Grandchildren are huge fans and loved it too. Why are all these people giving it such a low rating...I just can't fathom why. However, Mandelorian is just the BEST !!",1
3008,7.0,"As a movie on its own, I liked it. Again, it pushed all the right nostalgia buttons for me, a kid who grew up on 4, 5, and 6. All the old characters, Red 5, the Falcon and Chewie finally getting his! And Lando! Definitely brought out the 8 year old inside my now 50 year old body. A New Hope to The Last Hope!",1
3009,10.0,"Haters will hate! Honestly, go see it and judge for yourself, but this one of the best Star Wars movies of the entire franchise. Non-stop action. All the elements of what makes Star Wars... well... Star Wars. The ending would have never been perfect. It is the end of one of the biggest movie series of all time. But it delivered, and with just enough nostalgia sprinkled in. Thoroughly entertained for just under 3 hours... I couldn't ask for more. Other than more Star Wars, of course",1
3010,10.0,"The perfect end to an up & down franchise from a director who clearly loves it - aside from being an absolute visual treat with some of the best images and action scenes out of all the series this film is a fun ride from start to finish, you'll laugh, cry and grab the edge of your seat throughout - if you were hoping for a finale with heart and action in equal measures look no further, we were blown away",1
3011,10.0,"I don't even know where to start. J.J. Abrams, bravo! You did it. This movie grasps the essence of Star Wars. From where it started in the 70's to the end of the saga in 2019. It is not an easy task to wrap up one of the most popular movie franchises in film history, but this movie was the cherry on top. Staying true to the fans, to George lucas's vision, to the actors that started this journey so long ago, in a way that will be exciting for generations to come. For everyone giving this movie a bad rating, go join the sith. The force is strong with this amazing finale.

3013,5.0,"In my opinion, American movie industry is in a pretty bad state these days due to the Marvelization of Hollywood... Movies are becoming more and more boring and forgettable because everything has to be over the top. The sound is too loud, there are car chases and huge explosions everywhere, there is not one, but a thousand huge ships/aliens that can destroy entire planets... So you will, most probably, not be able to fully enjoy these movies because you will blank out most of the time. Your mind can recognize that your senses are being overloaded and it will switch to autopilot. But it is a trend in the movies industry.",0
3014,8.0,"Does this movie contain final battle between light and dark side? You can expect that.<br /><br />But this is more like leaving an old friend. All stories are told, you just share some old memories and little secrets.<br /><br />And yes, you needed that good-bye.",1
3015,2.0,"What a messy disrespectful movie. The Skywalker Saga goes out with an enormous middle finger to the audience as The Rise of Skywalker tries to distance itself from The Last Jedi and please everyone which isn't possible with Star Wars. I love the choices they made for the story in Episode VIII (The movie does have some significant problems but overall is a strong entry) and IX just goes back on every single choice which really just proves that there was absolutely no communication or plan shared between Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams. This entire trilogy just feels like separate films that all have distain for each other which is not how you make a coherent trilogy. JJ just immediately going back on Rians choices feels so disrespectful and completely counterproductive. This entire movie is just scenes of trying to ""fix"" TLJ and blatant fan service. There is nothing interesting happening here, it's just a safe and boring movie. The movie is technically well made but that's not something that even counts when talking about Star Wars because that's true for all of them. TLJ has a lot better visuals and color grading as well mostly because Rian Johnson is a much better director than JJ Abrams. There is nothing here that even sticks out to me. I was bored watching it and the only emotions it was able to illicit were disappointment and anger. I would give The Rise of Skywalker a D+.",0
3016,8.0,Movie-wise: Not very great.,1
3017,8.0,This movie is actually kind of great! Really entertaining and interesting from start to finish!,1
3018,10.0,"I have seen this movie in 3d and can only say that this is a masterpiece. It does not only introduce and maintain strong characters to and of the Star Wars Universe but fills a lot of Star Wars universe issues up, background content etc. Some would say it also fixes past Star Wars movie ""errors"", if you want to name it this way. The cast is simply astonishing and belongs to the finest actors in our generation. The emotionality of epic scenes for the movie itself as well as independently of and for the entire Star Wars universe is multiple times given and a must for any Star Wars fan as well as anyone who ever had a bit of sympathy for Star Wars, which is nearly the entire planet. How the directors managed to build these stable and strong emotions up, maintaining them and slowly unleashing them toward an audience that is used to emotions in movies during uncertain real life times with sometimes very chaotic emotions, is art second to none. There is one issue with certain very rare appearances of characters and their ""behaviour"" which does not always seems to match how you would expect them to behave or act, but only of side characters in 2 or 3 minor scenes. This is the only issue that I would have to name ""odd"", but the special effects alone turn it into a 10 out of 10 movie. The main actors turn it into a 12 / 10 stars movie and the directors and producers turn it into a 15 / 10 stars movie that defines the Star Wars universe new.",1
3019,3.0,"Star wars became a fantasy movie, with more and more event defying the laws of physics.<br /><br />It's totally unrealistic now, plenty of incoherences.<br /><br />In addition, obviously, Disney is here to make money only, they made it a kid movie Avengers-like with lot of kid ""jokes"".",0
3020,9.0,"I was 24 when the first Star Wars movie came out - it blew my mind. I soon heard that George Lucas envisioned a 9-movie epic story, but after Empire Strikes Back, it seemed like the rest of the story would never be told. Now it's been told (although not exactly as Lucas dreamed it, which possibly is a good thing - no disrespect). I'm 67 now and very happy to have witnessed the entire cycle in real time. The character of Rey is the zenith of the franchise and Daisy Ridley perfects that character in this movie. It's an extravaganza. See it.",1
3021,6.0,"Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, a film that supposedly concludes the beloved Star Wars franchise that made millions of fans fall in love with movies and became a series that redefined the level of Sci-Fi for future films yet to come.

3022,,"Before the final battle, The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable movie. But as soon as Poe starts to doubt that people are coming to support the rebellion, the movie copies all the story beats from Avengers: Endgame. A fleet of support comes in to fight Palpatine and his army, the same way all the Avengers assembled to fight Thanos and his army. A fight ensues between the two armies, until the main villain reveals he holds the power in the situation (Palpatine destroys the ships with force lightning, Thanos gets the Infinity Gauntlet). When the Rey defeats Palpatine, the movie straight up copies the climactic lines of Endgame (""I am inevitable"" ... ""I am Iron Man""). Now, it's ""I am all the Sith"" ... ""I am all the Jedi."" She even pauses during the line the same way Iron Man did. This movie ruins its ending by copying another movie.",1
3023,7.0,"The Rise of Skywalker closes the Disney Star Wars trio in a fitting and satisfactory way.

3024,1.0,"My girlfriend fell asleep during this movie. Can't really blame her, the plot was all over the place...",0
3025,6.0,"I classify movies into two main categories. Fun and filmy. Fun being movies that are predominantly box office and are looking to entertain. Filmy being the movies that are taking the movies as an art form. Star Wars falls into the former. It's not meant to be anything extravagant, it's just meant to be fun.<br /><br />This is my greatest frustration with big properties with a big fan base. There is so much critique over a movie that holds so much fan value. Having looked at the original trilogy, they are seriously no better than these. There is just to much expectation put into movies that are no more than a fun time. You can comment on plot holes, technical flaws, those are valid. But to claim it's bad through the lens of a fan wearing beer goggles for Star Wars creates this heavenly picture for a movie that will never be achieved. I have never expected a filmy experience from Star Wars because that is not the intention.<br /><br />As for the actual movie I had fun. It was not the best and also not the worse. I felt it was worth my money and did what it was suppose to do as a box office movie and entertain. Competent on a technical basis and good all around acting but with shaky writing and plot points that left me chuckling. But I'm not mad, why? Because I know what these movies are, and expect something more is to set yourself up for disappointment",0
3026,10.0,The average review for this movie should be in the 8's.,0
3027,10.0,With what was almost considered an impossible situation JJ came through.<br /><br />Overall this movie is an absolute roller coaster. Pacing issues I understand. But every scene was loaded and had meaning. I found myself invested the whole way through right to the end.,1

Junior, and had a terrible main plot destroying physic laws, with a poor war... that trash having better reviews than THIS MASTERPIECE, really proves that humanity is not as intelligent as we think, at least, the most of us aren't.",0
3029,10.0,Star Wars episode 9 is absolutely brilliant. It is truly a masterpiece,1
3030,7.0,The fight amongst the ocean waves must be one of the best CG scenes ever. In fact this is a must see on IMAX. Loved the grandeur of the backdrops and the action is amazing. Eye popping!!,1
3031,1.0,"This movie (not even calling it a Star Wars film) was terrible. The editing was so fast paced that there was no time for the viewer to view the moment and soak in, nor did the character grow to become better, they just are. No final battle scene, no climatic ending, terrible writing with no soul to the characters, just don't go; don't waste your money.",0
3032,2.0,"This movie seems to be a direct response to any criticism that fans had with The Last Jedi, and everything comes together in a completely incoherent mess. While watching The Rise of Skywalker, I felt like I was watching a 2+ hour long advertisement for sweet sweet merchandise. Retcons were made for the sake of restoring icons to the franchise, characters were boiled down to their stereotypes, and expanded universe material sprinkled in to please the dire hards. When you try to pander to everyone, you impress no one.",0
3033,8.0,Some people may be annoyed with this film but personally everything from Rey being revealed to be a Palpatine to Kylo turning good this whole film wraps the saga up well will call backs to previous episodes.,1
3034,6.0,I don't get why this is being reviewed as the worst in the Star Wars franchise --- there is always The Last Jedi at the bottom. But the strapping-death-star-cannon-to-star-destroyers pretty much certified Disney's lack of imagination.,0
3035,9.0,"The Rise Of Skywalker is an awesome finale to the Skywalker saga that contains action sequences and special effects that are awesome throughout the whole movie. It brings back old & new characters we all know and love including Lando, C-3PO, R2-D2 and even bringing back Emperor Palpatine as the main villain. The film is also very fast-paced and filled with emotional depth while correcting a lot of the mistakes that Rian Johnson made with TLJ. Thanks to that, J.J Abrams yet managed to get me to the very edge of my seat. Great movie and I can't wait to see what they got next!! 👏 🚀",1
3036,7.0,So reviews here seem broken nowadays - all 1 star or 10!,0
3037,10.0,A wonderful conclusion to a story that began in 1977. It hit the right beats of the original trilogy whilst at the same time interjecting elements of Disney humour also. Characters made sense with emotional depth that was required when tying up storylines.,1
3038,1.0,"Ruins old characters entirely, endless plot holes, you come away with more questions than answers. Fails to explain so many errors and has such lousy ideas. It's evident Disney is desperate and trying to use the old movies to boost their ratings but in doing so proceeds to spoil the entire franchise and what was good about it. The New trilogy should not be cannon and is the worst film I've ever seen.<br /><br />Thanks Disney I really needed that",0
3039,1.0,I hate Disney for creating this abomination.,0

I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I have been following these films since I was a kid, and this is one of the best. The unfortunate loss of Carrie Fisher and the use of a restricted amount of footage did make her a limited part of the story, but other than that this was an exiting and very enjoyable film.<br /><br />Perhaps I have gone soft in my old age, but on a couple of occasions tears ran down my face, and at other times I became tense wondering what was about to happen.<br /><br />Set aside your prejudices and expectations and go and enjoy this film as a roller coaster ride that it is. Enjoy it with the eyes of a child just like you did the first time you saw Star Wars.",1

But there are a few things that bug me that need to be addressed, first hating the movies because Disney bought the intellectual property, please, Disney is able to and willing to invest into extending the story and giving an opportunity for a whole new generation of fans to escape into George Lukas' imagination. Opposed to bringing our wishes to the theatre, just enjoy the journey - and frankly regardless of your preconceived notions on where the story should go, it was quite the journey.",1

3047,3.0,"For the first time in my life, I actually walked out of the theater during a Star Wars movie. The only reason I gave it three stars was out of respect for the franchise. Friends told me later how it ended but I didn't care.<br /><br />I've seen every Star Wars movie on the big screen since 1978. My parents introduced me to the series when I was young and I've taken my own kids to see them since The Force Awakens. These last two films have tragically taken the saga in all the wrong directions. I'm left now feeling disappointed by how the franchise has ended, but THANK GOD it's all over. I don't think I can stand to see it get any worse. At least Rogue One and The Mandalorian are really great, and they're not even part of the main story.<br /><br />If anything, I hope this last film serves as a reminder to all filmmakers to know when to quit and to avoid running other franchises into the ground.",0

3050,8.0,"Dark things to the Force bad editing does. In fact I think everyone's gripe with this movie comes one way or another from the awkward jumps and lack of explanation for what we see from one scene jump to another. A disjointed viewing experience that makes it look like incomplete and badly started vignettes where you miss the first few seconds asking, wait! How did we get here? What's this? Where did that come from? and then you give up trying to figure it out so you don't miss what's going on with the script running at amok speed. The major problem with this 2-hour 12-minute (plus end titles) movie is that it could not possibly be told in less than 2 hours 45 minutes.",0
3051,9.0,"Id read and heard a lot of reviews saying average and not that good. Well, I just saw one of the last screenings on the big screen and I thought it was really good.

3052,8.0,It's not like Disney can't produce a great movie with this they just didn't bother or care enough. They hired a pretentious director and it all went downhill from there. Thanks Disney for ruining Star wars,0
3053,4.0,Star Wars is a very strange franchise it hasn't had a Great Star Wars movie in like 40 years Star Wars is just very hit or miss. Most of the Disney Star Wars movies have been okay at best but this one oh boy it's almost on the same levels as the Prequels and yeah prequels are bad movie's i'll defend a statement to my grave anyway this is a really frustrating to watch every second of it I just wanted to slap myself in the face and I just kept screaming why why why has Star Wars come to this over and over and over again this is probably a Star Wars movie that I will not be visiting in a long time. Not as bad as the prequels but pretty goddamn close.,0
3054,1.0,What a shameful disgrace to the Star Wars name. These clowns coulnd't be bothered to plan out 3 movies and just dumped some hackneyed fanfichtion-tier garbage into cinemas everywhere.,0
3055,3.0,JJ. You ruined Star Trek. What you've done to Star Wars is insulting. Please leave the classics alone. Go and fiddle with your own $h1t!,0
3056,10.0,Dont see these stupid comments from people if you are a good fan of starwars series go and watch it is Cenima or wait untill maximum people to rate if your are a rating person. Overall movie is good I personally liked it finally they ended the series now they can start new series with further new characters. This ending was required also they clerified many thing..... Go watch in cenima and just enjoy the movie. palpatine is back......,1
3057,7.0,"Well, that does not mean it is a great one. There are segments in it that I found very entertaining. Besides of that there were many 'roll-eyes' and 'facepalm' moments as well. The problem is that the movie trys to fit so many tastes, that it seems to have no profile and feels rushed. The humour is most of the time just cheap, but there are also some scenes that are truly fun. The visuals and audio are great as always.<br /><br />So why it is the best movie of the sequels? Its Kylos and Reys character development that made the film interesting for me and lets it stick out compared to the other ones. I was emotionally affected in a way that I did not experience in TFA and TLJ. In contrast, most of the other characters could have been completely left out and often felt tedious. I was never bored in the movie - it was interesting until the end because of the main characters. In conclusion its an enjoyable, but far from perfect film. The rating, that is even worse compared to the other movies, obviously comes from expectations that we're finally not fulfilled.",1
3058,8.0,"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' (Episode IX) is the final piece of the trilogy of trilogies that comprise the Star Wars film phenomenon. It's hard to sum up the film objectively, as there's so much history, emotion and identity associated with the films - I can only imagine what it's like for people who saw the original trilogy in cinemas. I doubt this is the last time we'll see the opening title crawl & trumpets, but it will be the end of the Skywalker saga. It's a massive shame Carrie Fisher didn't film all her scenes before she passed away, but Leia still has an important role in the film",0
3059,1.0,Comedic dialog in this movie feels out of place from the daunting emotions of intense scenes. Reusing old characters from previous movies to advance the plot was unoriginal story writing. The film needed new or original main antagonist. The story writing ruins plot points and emotional value when characters return or revive.,0
3060,3.0,"The only expectation I had before going to see this movie was that all the loose ends be tied up,that's it. I didn't read any reviews before going to see it and only saw the 1 main trailer. The short of it is I am dissapointed. Most loose ends were covered which is good but how they got there just made no sense to me. Its also hard to rate because it left me so confused... the main reason I chose 3 stars was for the beauty of the visual effects and Cgi which was fantastic. The sound effects were also great The plot itself was workable, but the storyline and how they got there was horrible. Lots of continuity errors between the previous 2 chapters and this one, as well as some relationship development seeming to go backwards/seemed to be forgotten. I have loved star wars since I was a kid and its always enchanted me, but this one missed the marker. I also can't decide if I would recommend anyone see it in theatres or not, because the visuals will look stunning in a theatre but the storyline makes it not worth the price. So I've settled on advising people go see it at your own risk, and if not in theatres it will probably be worth a rental once its out on dvd and digital.",1
3061,10.0,I think I saw it but there's so many Star Wars movies they all blend in together. A bit like police academy,1
3062,10.0,Looking at it now the Rise of Skywalker looks like a failure because people are so focused on the things that can go wrong when you have 2 directors for a trilogy.,0
3063,5.0,"Doesn't matter what I say, you'll still end up going to see it. Was it better than Episode 8? Yes. But then again, so was the most recent PJ Masks episode. They attempt to fix their stupidity of episode 8 through the most rushed 30-45 minutes of film I've ever watched. What you think is going to happen probably will, and vice versa. Disney could've released Cats with the title Star Wars and still made money, but that may have required some actual thought. Whatever, go see it; it'll entertain you as long as you don't think about anything. They should have let Jon Favreau work on these films...",1
3064,1.0,"When Return of the Jedi ended, you felt a sense of happiness because there was such an absolute conclusion to a STORY. A complete story that showed a character's progression and hardships and personal growth. None of these things are representative of the female lead character in Disney's Star Wars Episode Nine The Death of the Skywalker Saga. That's the officially title that was changed by Disney to fool you in seeing this movie. Take a moment to compare the stories and characters in the original trilogy and the DISNEY trilogy. What's the most important takeaway? I cared about Luke, Leía, Han, C3PO, Vader, Palpatine, and Landó. These were not the only characters because there were so many who brought an imaginable eruption of feelings when you saw them on screen. The characters in the DISNEY trilogy lack any originality, are devoid of personality and I could care less if they had a backstory and since none of them struggle to be an actual padawan or a Master Jedi. The word Jedi meant something too, and now DISNEY has made it mean nothing at all. You don't need to see this movie, because it doesn't represent what STAR WARS symbolizes. Star Wars is about what it takes to achieve your full potential, and how powerful friendship can be during a time of conflict and in the best sense that Love can conquer HATE. Episode 9 shows you an empty template of a female character who has no flaws and knows everything. Rey isn't a Jedi, and she isn't a true Sith, and she isn't a SKYWALKER. This movie is about 4 story outlines mixed into one extremely flawed DISNEY conclusion to their trilogy. Save your time. Kylo Ren or Ben Solo whichever character this story needs him to be is just an angry little napoleon type that is an extremely emotionally bankrupt individual. He takes the place of the redemption story arc of Anakin who had an actual personality, and who loved before he turned to the dark side of the force. Ben Solo isn't even a poor man's Darth Vader as the corruption inside of Vader was because of the love he needed to save and therefore he betrayed the Jedi order to save her. Ben Solo in this extremely stupid interpretation of Vader is just an angry little guy who didn't have Luke or leia or Han to help him or guide him. The idea that Luke would contemplate killing his nephew in his sleep is very stupid in this DISNEY fiction. I don't accept that, just like I won't accept this film as STAR WARS canon. Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine too because I guess Palpatine had a son and that son married and he was eventually killed and they hid Rey on a planet to keep her away from Palpatine... but wouldn't Vader have known about this?",0
3065,1.0,The first 2 movies in this new trilogy were far from perfect but showed some promise for folks like me that started out with the original trilogy and even endured the second trilogy despite Jar Jar Binks and the moody young Anakin. The Rise of Skywalker was just wrong on so many levels. It made a mockery of the Star Wars Universe and just like JJ Abrams did with Lost it left me wondering why did I waste these hours of my life getting invested in this trilogy for such a lame ending. I halfway expected to see Vincent show up to lick Rey's face in the final scene!,0
3066,8.0,"In my opinion Rise of Skywalker beat all Star Wars movies or TV series before it. The story, character writing, and visual effects were all fantastic. For those wary of the overall low rating, pay attention to the number of 1s and 2s. When somebody rates something that low, it's rarely because of the thing itself. It's personal. Case and point: the worst movies of all time hardly break below a 2 on IMDB. Many of those reviews, for example, are more concerned with who owns it (Disney, a corporate giant) than the content. For those who say it's the worst Star Wars movie, they clearly don't remember how bad episodes 1-2 were (and those were under the leadership of Lucas)",0
3067,10.0,"LOVED it so much!! JJ, the writers and cast did an amazing job! If you've watched the original trilogy & the prequels there is really so much to APPRECIATE. It's a must see for any Star Wars fan and anyone who simply wants to enjoy a good movie. One of many things that resonated with me is how Anakin's desire to save someone he loved from death was finally fulfilled through his bloodline and not having to do so through the Dark Side. A wonderful story of redemption for the Skywalker family. I didn't agree with everything, but 99.9% of me did! Do yourself a favor and see it, then come to your own conclusion.",1
3068,2.0,"After the movie ended, my 8-years-old son asked me his usual question: ""Which scene did you like the best?"". And for the first time since we had started going to the movies together, I couldn't find an answer, although I really tried.

3070,6.0,"Ok. I just saw Rise of Skywalker. Artistically, it was very well made and exciting with some laughs and cool action scenes, but the story was confusing. Which of Rey's parents is Palpatine's child? When did Leia learn using a lightsaber and save one for Rey? How did Ben Solo die after kissing Rey? How did Palpatine come back from the dead? What ship was Chewbacca on if he didn't die? Where did the black quicksand come from? Why would Rey say she's a Skywalker if she isn't?",0

3072,6.0,"After the fallout that is The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams and the makers of this film had a near impossible job of pleasing the fan base and tying up the Skywalker saga.

3073,7.0,"After seeing this movie I admit that I like the hand of J. J. Abrams in Star Wars. The end of the sequel trilogy returns to being the fast-paced space adventure, after being briefly kidnapped by Rian Johnson. This is a very entertaining movie, with great action sequences full of very good visual effects, great photography that accompanied very good lightsaber battles. The story is again simple, direct and easy to approach. The plot twists, the surprising blood ties, the space battles, the big explosions, the puppets, and a long etcetera are already a tradition in a saga that, at least in the last decade, had a good closure with this trilogy.",1

JJ always did what the accountants told him and in 7 ripped off A New hope (but inferior) and here he ripped off The Jedi Returns. So they brought him back to fix his own mess or to do more damage? Is he and Kathleen Kennedy the sith lord and apprentice? At the same time there are always going to be people that don't understand Star Wars (or art) and give a stupid 10/10 score. The plot is basic and by the end you're left barely satisfied but is understandable because it is JJ Abrams. This movie was never going to wow people but it doesn't even hit the low Disney standards.<br /><br />Also, I hate the ugly shorthaired Mary Sue.",0

3081,9.0,"A fun spirited, nostalgic, and awe-inspired adventure, Rise of Skywalker makes up for its most contrived faults by providing a simply enjoyable Star Wars film and a fitting end to the long-running saga.<br /><br />The films flaws are not nearly as bad as I had pictured, having read earlier reviews, and now seen the movie. However, that certainly doesn't mean the film is lacking them, the film does certainly seem to have a rather thin storyline, and although at times it feels more realistic in this case to go after one thing to another to another, you can't help but feel like there should be something together holding this film all together.<br /><br />Some things in the film are also just plain silly, whether it comes to plot devices, transitions, or the mysterious and seemingly forced appearance of Palpatine within the film; or just some bad dialogue, there is quite a few things that is hard to truly take seriously.<br /><br />Besides those points, the film is one truly enjoyable ride, that is both welly acted and beautifully shot. The film will have you look in awe at just how beautiful the world's these characters are upon or passing through can be, and it certainly provides for a fitting feel for the film itself.<br /><br />The return of Carrie Fisher from previous deleted scenes is mostly done well. It at times can feel obvious that she is in fact dead, and seemingly not entirely present in the film alike, as the lines do feel a bit off, but the way they handled the lines seems more than worthy to acknowledge Carrie, and make her appearance enjoyable and worthwhile.<br /><br />The actors in the film truly do give it their all, with Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver providing the most out of their screen time throughout the film entirely.<br /><br />The film does feel it's 2hr 12 min length, but you can't help but feel it needs it.<br /><br />In the end, there are a few disappointing things about the final installment in the Skywalker Saga, but all together it provides for a mostly inspiring and well attributed film that is both parts enjoyable as it is satisfying.<br /><br />My Rating: 9.25/10",1
3082,9.0,", just got to see film in Jan in the cinema<br /><br />this final part of the rebooted trilogy does rediscover a sense of adventure and maybe even a sense of wonder.<br /><br />But there is something missing in this film<br /><br />I gave it, 9/10 There's not just a sense of an ending with The Rise of Skywalker but also a sense of fatigue that we have seen this all before, especially in the mad dash of the closing battle. The once awe-inspiring visual flourishes and world-building spectacle have become merely quick rushes of been there done that . There is, after all, a fine line between the gravitas and profound Jedi-babble of Star Wars mythology and cornball sentiment and wooden dialogue.",1
3083,8.0,"I grew up watching Star Wars and the original 3 movies were a big part of my childhood in the 1980s. Now, I'm certainly not a massive fan of the franchise but I do enjoy the saga and after a disappointing episode 8 I'm pleased to say JJ Abrams managed to bring it back on track and create an ending which was both emotional and true to the original movies. I felt like I was a 7 year old kid, back in the 80s all over again watching The Empire Strikes Back. The action and pace was non-stop, the cinematography incredible, the score excellent. But the thing I like about what JJ Abrams always does is he gets the emotion and tone just right, subtle hints of humor mixed with raw emotion and great character building, you feel for the characters, root for them and feel apart of the adventure!",1
3084,10.0,"I just went to see this. It was awesome. It is a sad thing that at this point in history any and every creative endeavour will inevitably become the focus of such wanton criticism from so many bitter and inconsequential individuals for no other reason than to inflate their own sense of self-importance and completely irrespective as to the merits of the creative work in question. Basically; if you dislike Star Wars, you will automatically dislike this film. If you liked the first three original Star Wars films back in the day but felt so betrayed by The Phantom Menace that you are unable to accept the notion that anything might ever dare to attempt to pass itself off as Star Wars again, you will automatically dislike this film. If you have enjoyed anything about any of the Star Wars films that have been made on Disneys' watch then it is virtually impossible for you not to love 'The Rise Of Skywalker' as it resoundingly succeeds in doing everything that any enthusiastic follower of the ongoing Star Wars franchise could possibly have hoped for. Let us not be dictated to by those who have already decided how they are going to feel about a film before even watching it (if they ever got as far as actually doing so).

3088,3.0,"DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE SPOILERS. This movie had so many holes and so many unanswered questions. First, you never find out what Finn is trying to tell Rey. You cannot bring that up multiple times, and then not close the hole - that's basic storytelling. Especially if this is the last film.<br /><br />Next, I hated Ben's death scene. I wouldn't have minded it as much if they had given his death proper closure. As one of, if not the best, character in the series, the death of his character was horrifying. He did not have a single line in the last 10 minutes of his ending. His death is sudden, and goes unmourned or uncelebrated. It's like it never happens at all. He just disappears.

Did I have a different idea for the ending of the saga in mind? Sure, but I'm happy to not be disappointed with the ending we got.",1

The actors made a very good job! Before I saw the film I thought it sounded strange bringing Palpatine back but it worked out just fine! The trilogy could have been better but as an effort by JJ, the crew and actors I have to give them praise for what they did. J.J should have done all three movies! The last Jedi destryed so much in the universe of Star Wars and that blame is on K. Kennedy, not on the actors or the crew! They should have followed the rules George Lucas had set up for the universe! I really liked the new forcepowers in the rise of Skywalker! They were explained but so few noticed. It was because the special bond between Kylo and Rey through the force.<br /><br />Now go and see the movie in the cinema! :)",1
3095,5.0,Unbelievable how they ruined the trilogy. Not even bringing Palpatine back could save it.,0
3096,,"You can tell J.J. Abrams had a specific direction for this trilogy and Rian went off the rails in regards to that direction. The third film tries to undo the doing of Rian Johnson's film which in a way makes the overall trilogy feel disjointed. I believe a fan-edit can help correct this mess in the future, combining scenes from VIII and IX to make a coherent story. Having Palpatine at the very beginning didn't feel organic, it felt as if he was supposed to be introduced in VIII and was not, so as a result, tacked on with a rushed first half. I hope that this specific film ends up having a couple hours of additional footage that can convert this disasterpiece into a miniseries that attempts to balance the storytelling - wishful thinking, however. Next time, keep the same filmmaker for the entire trilogy - it may had worked for the original trilogy but clearly does not work in today's reality where mostly everyone is completely divided in perspective.",0

3098,4.0,"J.J Abrahms ranks one Star Wars quote after another and runs Fan Service. As a result, the film feels like one of the greatest hits of the first three films. So we get a successful film with good effects, but an out of round and patched trilogy that had many ideas but was not worked out.",0
3099,7.0,I'm giving it a solid 7-8 /10. I'm a super Star Wars fan from the prequels and the original trilogy. Putting that aside and judging it from a neutral point TROS managed to be the best out of the new trilogy. Akward jokes and unnecesary dialogue are continued as usual yet good actions scenes and a somewhat decent plot make up for it. The movies relies a lot on other Star Wars movies and that's not entirely bad. Palpatines return does bother me but it also gives me a sense of unity amongst all Star Wars movies. Another strong point is the fact that the movie is much darker and Kylo Ren is perfectly done giving a feeling of Vader in the original trilogy (of course not the same). The problem here is Rey and its cero coherence with power levels in other movies. That's a big flaw as Disney's is focusing much more on making money and targeting a general and young public. Overall if you aren't looking for flaws the movie holds up decently and has a solid yet somewhat boring in imagination plot.,0
3100,1.0,This trilogy has been the biggest cinematic failure of all time. Disney hired the worst possible people and ruined the greatest film property there ever was. They slaughtered the golden goose.,0

3108,2.0,"Yes, it's better than Episode VIII.<br /><br />It's still one of the worst Star Wars movies ever made.<br /><br />There are too many logic gaps and I never had the feeling that the makers of the film understand what the title ""Star Wars"" really means.<br /><br />It just doesn't mean lightsaber duels, epic soundtracks, light vs dark side. It's much more.<br /><br />This seems to be a fan-service film but it doesn't reach me emotionally.",0
3109,2.0,"I thought the movie was quite awful. I will watch anything with a space ship in it, but JJ and Disney are completely exposed. They mixed up the characters and almost executed them. Completely predictable overall. A lot of whiny dialogue and scouring from a woman who does not care if men want her attractive or not.<br /><br />I could find a reason to watch her or her boyfriend.",0
3110,1.0,"I heartily recommend to avoid this movie if you've ever seen and enjoyed the original Star Wars, or rather, real Star Wars. This money grubbing scheme of a trilogy and this nonsensical finale in particular are undeserving of attention and time. So many plot holes, ridiculous scenes, absurd character decisions and lack of any character development, broken narrative... Awful. Horrible. Atrocious. Disney and JJ Abrams should be tried for making this travesty under a once appreciated brand.",0
3111,6.0,The Rise of Skywalker is an underrated Star Wars film. It is by no means perfect but it is absolutely a celebrarion of Star Wars. There are so many deep themes in this film. And it ultimately comes down to Ben Solo saving the woman he loves from death which is what Anakin aspired to do in the Prequels.,1
3112,9.0,"The established fans of the sequels will probably find a lot to enjoy in this, a bit too short, movie that takes all the most interesting new characters and puts them in even more interesting situations. However if you didn't already like the direction the force awakens and, more importantly, the last jedi has taken this one won't win you over.<br /><br />It revels in the exploring of boundaries that were semi-established in the already existing canon and sometimes takes a few steps in a direction that isn't entirely familiar. It is a daring final movie in a franchise that was daring to begin with. And in the end of the day STAR WARS has always been more fantasy than science fiction. It isn't supposed feel real; it's supposed to feel fantastical, and that it does.<br /><br />My final criticism of the movie is that it could have used twenty more minutes in the first two acts, and a bit more time developing the friendship of our main trio. It works well as it is but some of the emotional beats didn't hit as hard as they could have, and this comes from someone who has read the comics and books leading up to the movie.<br /><br />All in all an exiting but divisive conclusion that will yet again split fans between the dark and the light.",1
3113,9.0,Fantastic! I went in with an open mind what to expect. It was very well paced (albeit a bit too fast paced at the beginning). JJ did an outstanding job with the footage he captured in the Force Awakens with Carrie Fisher (RIP). It was very fitting.,1

3117,1.0,"That this movie was nominated for anything other than an ironic award AND doesn't have a 3star average is due exclusively to Disney throwing money around. I can guarantee you that JJ Abrams didn't watch episodes 1-3. I saw the interview where he talks about a new Hope and he didn't understand anything that happened in that movie. I promise you this dude watched the original trilogy, was lost the whole time, doesn't actually know what happens in Star Wars and just gave up watching the rest of the movies and that's why this movie makes zero sense",0
3118,8.0,I'm more if a Star Trek fan however most Sci Fi lovers appreciate Star Wars. There are only a few if the installments I love and this is one. The beginning and the end were the best parts with the middle being ho hum for me. I thought this movie buttoned up the storys ending very nicely and for me it was emotional. So when does Tarrentino begin filming his Star Trek film? That's what I'm excited about! 😁,1

However, that isn't saying much. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver done brilliantly creating two intriguing and grasping characters throughout the project. Nonetheless, those strong performances are let down by everything else around them. It is evident that Palpatine's inclusion was not discussed before the Force Awakens. It has been an ongoing process, ultimately meaning there was no proper vision or direction. This series had bags of potential, but it ends as it started - in disappointment.",0

The film series has been responsible for so many great moments that will stand in memory as time goes on. The sequel films have done well in the box office, despite being criticized by many fans.

I also wanted to see Leia being taught the jedi way and her relationship with Han. But instead we were given a new cast ( who were all good in the film ) and the original cast were, I thought, thrown aside maybe apart from chewy.

So sorry for their loss.

Bravo Disney! Just sorry that Harrison Ford was uncredited!",0
3138,6.0,"What a sad and tragic end. as many have said before eps 1,2,3 were not great but they kept within the star wars universe and at least had proper story lines through them. force awakens rekindled that a bit and stayed wtihin its universe, it also had a decent plot, humour and you got to know the characters, it also had humour, then came the disaster that was Last Jedi, destroying all that went before, with a nonsensical plot, magical elements, scneses just put together without coherence or neccessity, characters that did not mean anything. Rise tries to move forward from there but only succeeds in a very small way, it has to repeat from eps 4 to 6 give some sort of continuity, but that was just lazy, repeating big story moments re luke and his father now rey and her revelation, this had no where the same shock gasping impact as i am your father. i came back and watched ep IV again and just saw how great it still is , no where near the same amount of minlesss action, the pacing was way slowere and better we get characters, emotion, humour and when the action starts it does not go on for over, Rise was constnact frenectic movement action everyone talking really loudly no scnenes of actual meaning full dialogue. this is committe writing and film making, there is no vision behind it, no care or love. Lucas has stories for the last three i would love to know his version maybe its not too late to find out where he took his characters. he based the saga on classic world myths and archetypes he consulted with people like joseph campbell, which is why the apppealed and worked on a universal level. hollywood needs to find writers and film makers that have some depth that have some wisdom i bet there are fan stories that put these last episodes to shame.

I can imagine how a real Star Wars fan feel after this disaster of a movie. For 140 minutes all I have seen was unnecessary resurrections, teleportation of lightsabers.

First he was stabbed, then pushed off a cliff, then he transfers his ""life force"" or some other dumb force power to save Rey. Yes, Rey also dies and comes back.

The worst repetitive moments of all, which I get annoyed every about each time I see them, was the force bond between Kylo and Rey, that Snoke (Palpatine?) controlled in The last jedi. Suddenly somehow in Rise, Rey and Kylo are controlling the power easily and Palpatine has no idea...? Doesn't make any sense. Even if there is a directors cut, it doesn't forgive the forgetfulness of creating a consistent story. Very unprofessional. Also, It just feels like they had a time limit for the film and so everything is just cut down and rushed. It's definitely not the film it should have been. It's the only Star Wars film I haven't bought. Sadly the franchise stops at The Last Jedi for me. It's really sad and disappointing as Chris Trevorrows scripts was excellent.

It's certainly not a movie for everyone, and keep in mind that there are always going to be haters, so just watch it for yourself and don't be afraid to like it if you want to - whether a movie's good or bad is ultimately simply a matter of opinion. If you want to hate this movie, go ahead. If you want to like this movie, go ahead. Ignore the haters, the ones that say nonsensical things about it - each new Star Wars movie is always going to be the new one for someone to spread nonsensical, overboard hatred and nonsense for it.<br /><br />There were a couple scenes early on that I thought could have had more depth to, but since this is Star Wars, I wasn't about to let that stop me from enjoying it. They were just minor complaints and it is a very epic finale to the Skywalker saga with some amazing twists and turns. Very happy that I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but since it is the end to the Skywalker saga, I recommend that you watch it.",1

Character development was completely ignored which yielded bland, non-relatable characters whose motivations are never understood.

3152,6.0,"The movie wasn't awful like others giving it a 1/10 but anything over a 6/10 is being very generous. i'm not a big fan of the new trilogy but it's all perspective. it's definitely the best one of the three, however it felt so rushed and disjointed with a lot of answers i felt should have been given in episode 8 and some answers not given at all (maz with luke's saber for example). it jus had a very corporate feeling like it was trying too hard not to be different from their normal disney formula. this felt a lot like justice league to me where WB had way too much control over it rather than letting their directors/writers have any creative freedom. also, the lack of adam driver is bizarre, he is by far in my opinion the best actor in the movie yet he is used the least and his story gets fast tracked almost as if they didn't know how to conclude it or feels as if they jus wanted his story to end. daisy ridley does well for whats she's given, no complaints about her acting (she actually makes really bad material look okay). i didn't hate it but i also didn't think it was good. it is a very disappointing and underwhelming end to an epic beautiful saga.",0

But this isn't a random holiday movie, this is an installment of the biggest franchise in the world, Star Wars. And taking that into consideration, this movie goes from decently average, to a whole lot worse.",0
3158,9.0,I'll start of by saying I enjoyed the force awakens and really hated the last Jedi. For me this movie was a fitting end for all the characters I loved from the force awakens.

3159,7.0,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker concluded the Star Wars saga with an uplifting spirit of togetherness.

3162,5.0,"Born in 77, seen them all and the movie itself is fine. It's not good and that has more to do with the fact that Disney did not create a roadmap for these three films. The trilogy in itself was unnecessary. The pacing is ridiculously fast in this film to undo all the terrible things Rian Johnson did in TLJ. Bringing Palp's back didn't make much sense. Lots of fan service some good and bad. The movie is a 6 at best.",0
3163,3.0,"Are we sure this movie wasn't written by DnD? Because it's all about 'subverting the expectation'. Oh, did we say Rey's parent were nobodies? Surprise, they were 'nobodies' as in 'Palpatine's son/daughter'. Oh, did you think the Holdo Maneuver is relevant now? Surprise, it's a 'million in one chance'. Surprise again, some used it again in the background. Oh, you think this is a age with great technological advancement? Surprise, Leia dies making a Force-powered phone call. Surprise again, she's a Jedi Master. Surprise, every Jedi becomes a Jedi Ghost now, and they can use the Force. Remember the Knights of Ren? Surprise, they cannot kill even one person the whole movie. You know what, I can't do this anymore. The only saving grace is the CG, and I feel like that should be a given for a AAA title like this.<br /><br />Oh the Independence Day part? Remember how the aliens have the weak spot on the belly of the ship, and even then only when they were about to fire? Yeahhh, no such intelegent thought here. You'd think the star destroyer are made out of TNT.",0
3164,8.0,"A vey good conclusion of the Skywalker Saga. Its not perfect because there are many things that might have worked better in other directions or if they changed several things but it was good that J.J. Abrams was back on the directors chair as his film is very fan serving. Daisy Ridley was very good and delivered her best performance as Rey in this installment. I always loved how Adam Driver developed his role which was extremely well done and also here. Carrie Fisher was heartbreaking but I thought they served her VERY well in this film. Also good to see Mark Hamill and Billy Dee Williams. back and many other great cameos to look out for which I won't mention here but fans are in for a treat. Richard E. Grant was a bit wasted but I liked the new character played by Keri Russell. The Visual Effects were absolutely stunning and the films strength lie in the perfect imaginary and general visuality. If I know in my mind review all the films from Episode 1 to Episode IX and see the whole Skywalker saga as a total the film definitely succeeded. The only thing I had some troubles with is that it is basically a bit of a copy of the events in Episode VI, if you look into story, structure and that it makes many things established in previous films kind of useless. But thats the only big flaw I find with it. It was perfect entertainment with many nostalgic aspects. But yeah I think its now time to really call it a final. This film did prove that there isn't much more left to tell about the Skywalkers, Sith and Jedis.",1
3165,8.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is a totally enjoyable movie, and a legitimately great wrap on the story. It makes sense (Palpatine as the ultimate bad guy in all 9 episodes, and we know from the prequels that he knows about coming back from the dead).",1
3166,4.0,"Look, I've tried to write this review a dozen times, so let's just say this: this film is unfair to the franchise, actors, and the fans. Adam Driver is far too talented to be wasted like this; Daisy Ridley could also do more.",0
3167,8.0,"Unlike many, I found this addition to be quite pleasant. It wasn't awful or that bad; just written for a new generation, which apparently pisses off the die hard fans. For the ones pissed off at Rey's ""magic"" power; allow some elaboration. If you dont absolutely hate the prequels, you will remember that the old Jedi did not practice mourning for the dead; as Yoda says in II to Anakin, ""rejoice for those who become one with the force; mourn them do not, miss them do not."" Probably such force energy was forbidden with old Jedi practices because it led to attachment (hmm critical thinking); however, Rey is not old republic Jedi. She has sacred texts. No doubt she gained such abilities from reading the texts and not following the intense codes of the Jedi. So therefore, her force-healing, though convenient out-plot; works well within in-plot. The dyad thing I thought was pretty spot-on for the series. Duality is common throughout all the series, not just particular film. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were both fantastic as per usual; and I love the take of Palpatine, a sith lord who already knows about midi-chlorian creation; having children and grand-children. No doubt such a repulsive creature like Palpatine would ever use basic pro-creation methods to get what he wants. The hate this film got is unfounded and led by extremist die-hard fans. Fun movie to watch!",1
3168,1.0,"I think the ""special effects"" and unusual-looking aliens are why any of these movies (save the 1st one released) are viewable. It's certainly not for a plot. This one does have fantastic scenery in the island. That is IT. I should have watched this last night. I had an awful case of insomnia. This drivel of a movie would have put me right t o sl e e p.",0
3169,5.0,Does look pretty. The attempts at comedy are particularly cringeworthy.,0
3170,2.0,"Had slim hopes for this until J.J. was out in charge. After hat I knew it was going to be another ""cover"". Simplest explanation of this trilogy would be Ep. 7 is a reworked COVER of Star Wars. Ep. 8 is TESB run backwards with character plots run fwds along with some stupid ideas and no knowledge of physics. So Ep. 9 is of course ROTJ just reworked to cram in as many loose end tie-ips as they can but still fail. Best idea would be to pretend it didn't happen and do the whole thing again with Favreau in charge and just follow the infinitely better storyline Zahn put forth that makes a ton more sense.",0
3171,1.0,"I think Disney thought that Star Wars fans were so dumb we'd just be happy to see a Tie Fighter on the big screen with some old characters and wouldn't even notice the lack of storyline. Horrible, awful, lazy and RUINED classic Star Wars.",0

3173,7.0,"It's a star war movie, so it is better than average movies out there, no question about that. But, it is a star war movie, so the expectation is higher. The plot is almost the same for most of recent series, i.e., resistance fights against first/last order and wIns of course with the help of Jedi force. No novelty. The choice of actors/actresses is not ideal, except Rey. I think she is fine. With Disney strikes back, overall I think it is better than my expectations.",1
3174,9.0,"JJ Abrams had a very difficult task at hand. So far, I´ve had no explanations on how they could allow Ryan Johnson to direct such a disaster. People complaining that the story told in this new trilogy was not of epic proportions, was due to the fact that ep VIII ruined that possibility. Lucky for us, JJ found a way to stop the bleeding and give us a very entertaining ep IX with very nice surprises, great tributes to the whole saga, great chemistry among the whole cast and a very suitable conclusion for many characters and for the whole story that began with The Phantom Menace.<br /><br />The most important ingredient for any movie is its story. Is this story what JJ Abrams thought when he wrote ep VII? Possibly, yes. And if they had developed that story throughout ep VIII and IX, then a much more compelling saga we would have had.<br /><br />I believe that this episode rivals in entertainment with ep IV and V.

Familiar faces and new faces merge into one with this epic series leaving a genuine legacy and foundation for new generations of storytellers and audiences to build upon. Thank you from someone who saw the original over 40 years ago and is still amazed that this story keeps entertaining and telling us about the force. May the force be with you.",1

3179,1.0,"Although 7 and 8 were flawed is some ways I was still pretty darn happy with them. But TROS just ruined the trilogy. Especially for a Saga ending note it was just awful. Unoriginal, lazy, predictable, cliche, and drowned in fan service. Also, totally rushed by Disney. They should never how bowed to the fan outrage after TLJ and stayed the course on an original and fresh direction for the franchise. But even though they did, you can tell they rushed it. The story is so clunky and never feels fully formed. I can't look back on the sequel trilogy with anything but regret that they got this final installment so terribly wrong.",0
3180,6.0,"Star Wars will never be the same after the original trilogy. Sure, it has been a cash cow for a long time - However, the ending trilogy is at least an improvement to the mediocre soap opera from the early 2000s.",0
3181,3.0,Has anyone at Disney listened to the droves of fans complaints over the past few years? Why spend this much money on producing the most important movie of the trilogy only to give us this spew ? This is a big f u from Kathleen Kennedy. Have you seen how happy she looks in her latest interviews? She knows this is a last dig at us fans as the trilogy finalizes. This just shows that Kathleen Kennedy must go. She is useless as the head of Star Wars. Bring your social justice garbage with you.,1
3182,7.0,"A legendary villain resurfaces commanding a massive fleet of planet-destroying Star Destroyers, forcing the various franchise semi-Jedis, anti-heroes, and comic relief to embark on a quest to find the legendary home planet of the Sith. While better than the last entry into the canon ('The Last Jedi'), the film retreads what we've all seen before: self-agonising self-realization, last-minute heroics, quippy dialogue, overblown pseudo-mythology, predictable surprises, and an all-powerful enemy who, once again, leaves a womp-rat sized hole in his nefarious plans (this time it's a giant fleet but only one starter's pistol). On the plus side, the imagery is awesome, there are lot of entertaining nods to the earlier films, and less Rose than the last movie (and this time she's not stuck in a really stupid, pointless, side-story). Possibly salting the mine of collectables, the film introduces lots of new characters, all 2D and uninteresting, to accompany the generally bland cast (Daisy Ridley is OK as Rey). The dialogue is clunky and artificial, and the humour often forced, but the worst thing about the film (IMHO) is the endless preaching about how we all need friends... with friends we can succeed... we all need to work together, etc. That message was made in the original film with a few well placed lines, but now we have to put up with a sermony pre-climatic battle 'heroic' speech and a huge, cloying, post-climatic group-hug. The films (and maybe the fans) started taking the whole 'Star Wars' shtick too seriously, so I guess that this is a fitting end to the series. All that said, I'll continue watching the spin-offs, if only for the great design and visuals.",0
3183,9.0,"Is this movie perfect. No it is not. Is this a welcome and enjoyable addition to Star Wars, absolutely without a doubt. This movie (at least in my opinion) ignores or retcons The Last Jedi. I dislike TLJ as a Star Wars entry. It was a poor follow up to The Force Awakens, and I felt poorly paced and executed. TROS is breakneck speed pacing to revise this movie. Many of those narrative flourishes land, though it makes the first two acts seem rapid fire. However the final act is pure adrenaline rush Star Wars epic action, sacrifice, heroism. This film is likely to be divisive. If you enjoyed the established direction of TFA, and were disappointed in TLJ, you will be pleased here. The characters get the most exposition and though many parts go as predicted I found myself with that childish glee that Star Wars at its best instills me.",0
3184,1.0,First off I'll start by saying shame on George Lucas to let Disney finish this sage all this movie was is a remake of episode six with different cast worst Star Wars I've ever seen very Disappointing and just FYI there was no ride of skywalker the title is a joke it's the rise of Rey,0
3185,7.0,"Minor spoilers.<br /><br />An average Star Wars movie. However the damage was dealt with episode 8 and its stupid plot. That's what happens when you do not have an overall vision for the whole trilogy and you make the plot piece by piece. Ep 9 had to undo all of ep. 8. The movie itself felt rough, incomplete. Even the music was not good enough. Let's hope that the new trilogies/movies will be better. The Mandalorian is a step in the right direction.",0

Visually stunning, you should watch this on the biggest and best screen you can.",1

3190,10.0,The Emperor died in R.O.T.J was vaporized job done so if it's not him who was controlling this projection? If the prequels made you cringe and shiver then this movie will make you relive those feeling and much more. The rules are out the window and who was the great and mighty oz. This Christmas snoke is revealed to be not real and you will finally find out who's Rey's parents are and their not scavengers and she knows. There are so many misleading stories that when the truth finally comes out most people will just not see it. Rey is so close to her mother in all three films. The truth is her mother and father are both skywalkers after all. There is a great scene where she buried her parents lightsabers. It explains the han and ben hated luke so much. If you are force sensitive you can now projet yourself and multiple objects in any location and move these objects even from one place to another. In the end the rise of skywalker harps back to Luke and Leia and Han and that love triangle from episode4 New hope.,1

It's a sad farewell to what George Lucas created. The acting is bad, things happen for no reason, they wanted 2.5 hours on this, when it can be condensed down to 1.5 hours without all the nonsense they included as filler. JJ Abrams would now go down as the worst producer of our time for ruining such a great franchise.",0
3194,4.0,There were endless possibilities after TLJ and the movie goes in a very predictable direction.,0
3195,9.0,"I'm not gonna lie, this film has some flaws. But we have to take into account that JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio had to come up with a story that had to suit well with both those who liked TLJ and those who disliked it. Furthermore, the writers had the insurmountable task of finishing the sequel trilogy (not to mention the whole saga) knowing that there were no overarching story panned out for VII-VIII-IX. In my opinion JJ and company are able to give life to a very entertaining Start Wars adventure in XIX, one that expands our knowledge of the Force while developing the character arcs of both Rey and Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. The return of the Emperor is quite epic and it manages not to destroy the legacy of the franchise's biggest baddy. Not only that, thanks to said return we get to learn more about the nature and potential of the Dark Side. His project, abilities, behaviour and dialogue fall in line with the person we knew from both the Prequels and the Originals, which is a positive aspect of the film. The idea that Palpatine is being pulling the strings all along is completely believable (at least I bought it) and, once more, mirrors the narrative of the past trilogies. The pace is quite all right but you still have moments to breathe and laugh. The action bits are very good and we are given lots of emotional scenes. This flick also relies heavily on nostalgia which is not a bad thing considering this is the last entry of the Skywalker Saga. For the people who are unhappy with the way Disney handles the legacy characters, the movie gets to nail it's use of Lando, Chewie, Luke, Leia and - spoiler alert - Han Solo (appears as memory to help his son turn back to the Light Side), so everyone should be satisfied in that regard. Finally, the final scene is seriously emotional and fitting. Perhaps more Force Ghosts could have made their way into the final cut. The presence of Luke and Leia is fine and suitable for the end of the Sequels, but since this is the end of the whole Saga the presence of the likes of Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, etc is also required. Nonetheless, the voices of those historic Jedi are heard in the final confrontation between Rey and Palps which means that they are not absent from TROS, which would be a shame. Having said I politely urge all the SW fans to give IX a chance. Please don't be influenced by those who say that this is a dumpster fire and go check out and forms your own opinion on the subject. There are loads of positives in this film and really consider this to be a satisfying conclusion to the 42 year long franchise created by George Lucas.",1

I'm not going to call it incredibly thought-provoking (it's not) neither will I cite its incredible insights into the human condition (there aren't many), but what it is is a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure and a sprawling space opera epic that feels more akin to 1980s George Lucas than anything I've seen since.

The movie is quick paced as JJ tries to fit two movies into one but it never left me confused. Not everything is explained but it doesn't need to be, why anyone needs ever to make perfect sense in a fictional universe is beyond me. The Emperor is back, ok, it's not explained how, ok, is Ian McDairmid still awesome, yes. Easy as that. The Rey/Kylo stuff that was the best of The Last Jedi is taken up a notch here and you can see where JJ wanted this story to go all along and he gets there with some big fights, and even bigger emotional payoffs. It worked for me. Just be entertained, if you're not, then don't go see it because it wasn't made for you.

3220,9.0,"I cannot say I agree with some of the reviews I have read before and after seeing the movie. It was a pleasure to watch, a well-paced and truly intriguing movie. There was a bit too much of the ""Harry Potter"" style of Force usage and some awkward points but nevertheless I quite enjoyed it.",1
3221,2.0,"The sequel Star Wars film's this century have never really been great although I thought the prequel Rouge one and Solo ,was good enough, the acting and script quality compared to the original Star war series has never been matched and is pretty poor, The Rise of Skywalker is the worst star wars yet I found my self bored even before the halfway point with not much actor charisma or actor quality to make up for a script and story line that seem's to be written for a 8 year old kid.<br /><br />So surly the final scene with a fantastic battle towards the end with some tactical input in the script would save it? No, the plan is to hope that the rest of the galaxy turns up to help defeat the dark side, that's the plan!!!, and with some horse like creature's to charge lasers from a tribe that only gets about 10 minutes air time.It seem's quantity rather than quality was the plan in this film , I think Disney should release its hold on the franchise its not just for kids and the acting and script, like the originals should reflect that.<br /><br />EDIT---If you want a real good new star wars experience then stream The Mandalorian series on Disney ,I found it faultless ,Disney got that very much Right.",0

3223,9.0,"I loved it. I was a teenager in 1977 when the first movie came out. I remember one theatre that ran the film for an entire year. I can't say enough good about this movie. Never drags and even if you have not seen the other movies you can follow it. It makes you want to see the other films again. I've seen all the films and I was surprised over and over in a good way. I didn't foresee anything, but I must say I don't watch trailers I like to be surprised and see it all for first time when I go. Too many trailers or reviews ahead of time ruins it for me. I like deciding for myself and not letting others decide for me ahead of time. Great writing and acting. Don't let all bad reviews decide for you. I disagree whole hearted and I'm a syfy guru. Again I say Watch this movie and enjoy the ride of a lifetime. This is what teens of all generations wait for. They will remember this 40 years from now with great fondness.",1
3224,1.0,"This film, and this trilogy, has done nothing but crap all over the previous 6 movies' characters, their stories and motivations as well as breaking the rules of the lore itself.

With the worst dialogue I've ever heard? With the forced chemistry of the actors? With the fact that kylos character did absolutely nothing? With lando randomly showing up? Or is it with every half second?.... sorry to hate but it's been since 1977, we have all been raised on star wars what a tragedy to end all of our childhoods with this piece of garbage. Dont worry though my friends go to YouTube the fan films are brilliant much better than hollywood.",0
3227,8.0,"I never writer reviews, but this isn't a bad movie.<br /><br />I actually would like to see it again. I love Rey and find the storyline between Rey and Kylo fascinating enough to love this movie. Yes there are plotholes and they try to please everybody and they have tried way to hard to make it epic. But it is not a bad movie. I have seen a whole lot worse.<br /><br />It is made by Disney that is pretty obvious, but don 't get influenced bt other opinions, it is worth watching.",0
3228,7.0,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a decent movie, but it sadly doesn't end the Skywalker Saga on a high note. Lets start with the Pros: The acting was excellent, the VFX is still great here, the soundtrack is still marvelous, and the duels were cool. Now the negatives: The story is plain mediocre, the big plot twist didn't stick the landing, the fan-service was forced, and the ending left me with a mixed feeling. I understand why the movie wasn't like it should've been, because TLJ messed up the Sequels badly, but instead of acknowledging the movie, they try to retcon it, and it leaves so many plot holes. TROS is at least an enjoyable movie to watch, and it feels more like a Star Wars movie than TLJ, but that still doesn't make this movie a solid conclusion. I'm hoping that Disney does a lot better with Star Wars going forward. TROS is good, but far from perfect imo.",0
3229,10.0,"This might be my favorite star wars movie! After more or less hating the other 2 of this trilogy and after i saw bad ratings online, I thought here we go for the last disappointment. To my surprise this movie did everything I wanted to see from star wars since i was little and saw the prequels.",0
3230,1.0,"That's what you get when you cross a terrible script, and terrible acting with cool special effects. The special effects by themselves probably make it worth 2 stars, but the awful writing and execution of decisions made in this entire trilogy's story arc make it worthy of nothing more than a 1 star despite the good effects in my opinion. This newest star wars trilogy should be quickly forgotten, and is truly an example of the execs not caring at all about respecting the source material. I knew it was bad when i realized the things that happened off screen were way more interesting than what the movies actually showed us. I tried to like these newest additions in the saga but i have a brain, and unfortunately it wouldn't allow me to see past the obvious plot holes and just plain bad story telling. How this got anywhere near a 7 rating is just plain baffling.",0
3231,2.0,"At no point did I care about what was going on. This is because throughout this trilogy we never really get to know these characters. Fin could have been such a great character coming from a storm trooper past, but he just spends half his time yelling. All the characters do is run, shoot and fly through the plot that we rarely get human moments with them to get some relatability. Rise of Skywalker was a course correction from The Last Jedi which made the film come off as an apology. The film was simply a bunch of rapidly moving starwarsy images put to nostalgic music. If you have an attention span of no longer than 15 seconds and you like special effects set in the Star Wars universe, then maybe you will like it. The whole Disney trilogy ended up being a massive disappointment and I'm just going to pretend that Episode 6 is still the true end of the saga. For the life of me, I cant understand why Disney wouldn't have a solid plan for all three films before starting production.",1
3232,5.0,"Well the action scenes were good, the CGI was good, the pace was way to fast and the plot, well baby Yoda could write a better plot than this. Absolutely nothing to get your brain thinking or caring about the main characters, add to that they just make up new forces that never existed in previous star wars films. I mean if a Jedi could heal then surely Anakin would have saved is mam in the prequel trilogy. Also why is this even called the rise of skywalker? Luke was in it for less than 10 minutes. It should have been called the ""unbeatable Rey"", because Rey literally can do anything with no master teaching her, no practice, it just happens for her. The whole 'skywalker"" saga was about Anakins redemption and that happened in return of the jedi when he killed Palp, but Disney tried to milk more money off the fans by remaking the original trilogy, same plot, same types of characters but just done much much worse. No wonder Geroge Lucas wanted nothing to do with this trilogy. If you compare the writing on these last three films to that of say the clone wars animation, then the clone wars animation completely pummels this trilogy, it's not even close. Do yourself a favour and wait for this to be shown on TV then forget about it and go watch clone wars again.",0
3233,9.0,"It is a good ending at the end of the saga. It has some flaws, but you can look over most of them. I liked most of the character arc and I really enjoyed the scenes between Rey and Kylo.",1

3236,9.0,"Because of all the 1 star reviews i waited for the movie to come out on iTunes.<br /><br />After seeing ""The Rise of Skywalker"" I am more sure than ever that people should pass a psychological evaluation before they are allowed to post on the internet. All this whining and bashing over a great movie has nothing to do with an objective critique, these are unstable individuals who read the Star Wars novels and are now disappointed that they took the story somewhere else.",0
3237,9.0,"With all the negative buzz going on, perhaps my expectations were lowered, but I really enjoyed this last chapter. Sure, if you're set on hating it, you're going to find plenty wrong with it. Very cheesy scenes, plot holes, fan service, and so on. But despite those issues, I found myself getting into it and with about 30 minutes to go I had a tear in my eye.<br /><br />So I get why critics are tanking this movie. But for me, I loved it, despite the flaws. And if you're willing to forgive it's flaws, I think you will too.",1

3240,3.0,"In one film, every Star Wars story, legend or prophecy is now null and void. Remember how Anakin and the Skywalker's were supposed to bring balance to the force? Doesn't matter anymore.

3243,7.0,"I'll probably end up rewatching this movie and changing my review. But I felt like this was a good conclusion. They gave enough fan service to make everyone happy, but some characters felt like they were wasted and sidelined because of Rey. I get that she is the main character but Star Wars is always about teaming up with your allies in order to overcome any obstacle. Rey for most of the movie just abandons her friends to go off and confront Kylo herself. Still, the cinematography in this movie is phenomenal and the fights in this movie look much more polished then the fights from The Last Jedi. 7.5/10",0
3244,1.0,The most egregious of reimaginings of pre established ideology since Mohammedism.,0
3245,8.0,While I do not hate this film by any means the end of skywalker saga deserved much better. It is still a fun action adventure film unlike last Jedi. All I'm gonna say is there was so much to pack into one movie and I genuinely believe if jj directed all 3 movies the trilogy would be great.,1
3246,6.0,"I can't believe it , as soon as the movie was finished ingot out of the cinema and had to sit down for 10 min or so to realize what i've seen, it's 2019 people, almost 2020 and movie with. Budget of 330 mil can't even be compared the third chapter which was made back in 2001, and yes this comes from a true stat wars fan, i was so dissapointed and sad as soon as i saw the ending , cause you idiots ended saga like that , i mean could it be worse? More like rushed movie with rushed fights and action which wasn't included in 7th and 8th",0
3247,10.0,Don't ignore the 10 out of 10s. Some fans will pick holes and I get that. I saw the first film in 1977 as a six year old. Great films are meant to make you feel like I did in 77 when I was six and in 2019 now I'm 48. Throw yourself into it and you'll love it.,1
3248,10.0,"This was an excellent conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It fixed many issues from the last jedi, such as clarifying who rey's parents were, and how rey was so skilled (she trained hard, it turns out. Which should have been what everyone thought to begin with). I don't have much to add that you can't find from other positive reviews on here, so instead I'll respond to a few of the more insane ones:<br /><br />""Its made to pander to as many demographics as possible. Characters must be 25% white/25% asian/25% black, 50% women, all whites must be evil, etc.""<br /><br />Um, I guess if all you were doing was tallying up what race/gender every character was, you probably didn't enjoy it. Since, you know, you weren't paying attention to the story. I have no idea how accurate his count is, because I was busy actually following the characters and the story, but since it doesn't really matter to anyone but angry racists /misogynists, it's pointless to speculate.<br /><br />""Pulled Palpatine out of thin air after he died""<br /><br />Um, he was tossed into a shaft. Sith and jedi have easily survived worse. And what other force user had the power to do the things snoke supposedly did? Many people speculated that snoke *was* Palpatine for that reason.<br /><br />""rey has abilities no one else has ever had! Cheap""<br /><br />Numerous jedi were capable of force healing. Using the force to sheath a lightsaber or halting the beam was something Palpatine had done before.<br /><br />""Rey shouldn't be as good as kylo, he studied longer""<br /><br />Rey has been wielding melee weapons for at least as long as kylo, and was already quite physically fit and fully grown. That drastically reduces the training time needed compared to a little youngling who'd never fought anyone before.",0
3249,8.0,"This movie was awesome. A nice conclusion to the last trilogy and I'm happy with the rounding out of the Skywalker saga. Look, if you love Star Wars, then you can love this movie. If you don't love Star Wars, go see another movie. Oh and remember, just because you grew up watching Star Wars, like I did, it doesn't mean it BELONGS to you. Stop saying that the last trilogy has ruined your childhood... Because if a movie can ""ruin your childhood"" then you got much bigger problems than watching a ""bad movie""...",0
3250,8.0,"Just saw the new Star Wars and I liked it! Maybe not the best ever, but still an enjoyable movie. It has plenty of action and some funny and sad moments. One chase scene is reminiscent of the land speeders chase from Return of the Jedi. It is thrilling and action packed. The haters who just love to whine like childish babies about this movie just really need to get over it and get a life. This movie does not deserve a low rating. We all know that the original trilogy can never be topped. This new trilogy is entirely different and I don't think even tries to out do the original trilogy because it can't be done. But the new Star Wars films are still quite enjoyable in their own way. Hell, back in the day with Return of the Jedi, people whined about the cute Ewoks. (And yes, they were cute and humorous. I had no problem with them). I loved that movie! It's one of my favorites. Anyway, this movie needs to be seen with an open mind. If you're already prepared to hate it, you will. If you see it without any expectations, you may just like it like I did. I was certainly teary eyed to see the saga come to an end.",1

He loved it, I was satisfied, what more can you want. All the Star Wars nerds saying this is an awful film are just wrong. It takes things from earlier Star Wars films? Yes, of course it does!

Lots of revelations (but I'll keep you in the dark on those) plus lots of worlds. It felt a little rushed but otherwise wasn't too bad. As the final chapter in the Skywalker saga, I think I enjoyed it more than I did Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith combined. It's not a perfect film, but you go to the movies to be entertained, not to sit there and complain. Plenty of action too. If you were turned off by The Last Jedi, this may be a redeeming factor. And a good one too. But don't take my word for it. Just see it for yourself.",1

3260,6.0,"While I can appreciate that someone did pick up the Star Wars torch to bring it to newer generations, this is a case of a potentially great epic falling into the wrong hands. The story had some interesting elements within it, but as always with these films that wish they were Star Wars, half of it could have been cut out and simplified to make a much better film. Too many little formula cop-outs to count, including trotting out the same old horse of ""OMG so-and-so is dead!!! No they're not, YAAAYY"" to the point that it had no emotional effect other than mild annoyance.",0

Disney has subverted the gist of the SW universe and it's horrible.",0

3263,2.0,"Ironically, the original Star Wars was a landmark in cinema. The first ""blockbuster"" of its then era in 1977, which changed cinema forever. SWTROS suffers from the same rehash malaise and lack of originality as the other two sequels. Nothing new here. Same old same old. Excessive use of pseudo spectacle, explosions and rapid scenes. Scenes which are so short and overstuffed that you don't get chance to react or feel anything, before the film jumps to the next thing. Much should have been cut out and the important parts extended. The other flaw is you don't care about the characters because they're so thinly sketched. The original film leads had great camaraderie with an unforgettable villain in Darth Vader. Here, I only liked Poe. Finn was ok but thinly written. Rey was too serious and unlikeable in each film. Characters were introduced and wasted, as we'd seen in the other two films. YMMV. There wasn't the mix of lightness of touch and balance that the original films had. Balance between key events, character, humour, seriousness. Here it was like Star Wars on steroids. People died and came back to life. It was like a cheat episode of Doctor Who with its ""everybody lives"" cop out.<br /><br />There's much that could be criticised in the plotting of these sequels. Given it was effectively a greatest hits copy of the original films, they would have been better, over three films, directly portraying the return of the Empire/First/Last Order under the Emperor and his eventual defeat again and entirely restructuring how they used and disposed of the original characters, Luke in particular. Rather than what they did. These films will likely drift into obscurity, as with the prequels. But for different reasons. They're unlikely to have the longevity of the original trilogy, which had such an impact on cinema and audiences.",0

3290,1.0,"Greed of Corporate Movie Companies can ruin even Classics. Out of nowhere, they resurrected Emperor Palpatine!!! For Gods sake, he was killed off in Return of the Jedi. Then, they make Rey a grandchild of Palpatine!!!<br /><br />Other glaring contradictions were, Kylo Ren was good, turned bad, again became good. Rey dies and Kylo who survived the final battle with Palpatine gives his life force to her. Was like a Ping Pong game.<br /><br />Chewbacca was supposedly killed in the Trooper ship, But no....he was supposedly in another one. So wat the hell was pointed out then to Rey??!!<br /><br />The rebel alliance comes in to save the day at the very last minute as in all the previous films. Hoorayyyy......but was a feeling of Deja Vu.<br /><br />A few additional characters who were not given enough screen time as already script was overloaded.<br /><br />Disney says it is the end of Star Wars saga......but as I said Corporate greed knows no bounds. Sure to be a spin off on Palpatine family and continuing saga of Rey. Little wonder it dint perform to expectation at box office.",0
3291,10.0,"With all that is being said, I have come to the conclusion it is impossible to make a Star Wars movie that satisfies the critics and the big fans. Those two groups have an inverse correlation with what they want both Star Wars to be and the movies themselves.",0
3292,,"I saw Rise of Skywalker yesterday going in disgruntled by the early reviews. Upon further review, The critics negative input on the film, was incredibly wrong. I haven't been this drawn into a Star Wars movie since I was a kid watching the original saga for the first time. There literally wasn't a dull moment throughout this whole movie. A visually pleasing work of art that is filled with action, emotion, nostalgia, and so much more. This was about 90% of what I wanted out of this movie, as they executed the finale very well. I was no fan of the Last Jedi and feared that this movie would be even worse. Though, this was far from the case as REAL Star Wars fan will appreciate this film for what it is. Without saying too much, I see a lot of Return of the Jedi in this film, (one of my favorite Star Wars films) which is probably why I loved it so much. Please go into this with a positive mindset because it really makes you feel like a kid again, start to end. Thank You JJ Abrams for executing this successfully!",1

3295,10.0,J.J. Abrams had nearly an impossible task .....concluding a long ass movie franchise that became a bigger and bigger mess with each movie....especially the last one.,0
3296,1.0,"To put it simply, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was terrible. The only good thing that I could name about it was the score. That doesn't save the film from the awful plot, fight scenes that are void of tension, a pace of changing scenes that gives you whiplash from watching, teleporting characters, forces powers that eliminate all states, everything to do with Kylo, mistreatment of characters from the OT and the absolute butchering of my boy Sheev. My point is that this film tried to act like it was built up by every last mainline Star Wars film to date; it isn't. Don't watch this film. It isn't worth your time. Don't give Disney money for blatantly disrespecting everything to do with Star Wars from before they owned it.",0
3297,5.0,"J. J. Abrams knows how to do awesome visual stuff, he has a great eye to discover actors, and he knows how to do great action scenes. But, definitely, he's not Steven Spielberg. To do a movie or a TV series like Lost you need to know what's your story about.",1
3298,2.0,"This trilogy started off with horrible and the 3rd on said hold my beer. Story, characters and casting was the worst. Way too ruin an once entertaining and fun franchise. The actor that plays Finn should get a new day job.",0
3299,6.0,"The conclusion to the latest Star Wars trilogy, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is cluttered with characters of trivial interest. I couldn't care less about the new, wannabe Han Solo's relationship with the helmeted woman, for instance, nor his friendship with the former stormtrooper, nor that guy's with another ex-stormtrooper, and so on. None of that is significantly developed or consequential here, so why would I be interested? The series' continued introductions of cute robots (the new one here being reminiscent of Pixar's Luxo lamp, the logo of another former studio of George Lucas since sold off to Disney) and small creatures continues to be a nuisance, whereas moments of humor generally fall flat (e.g. the shot of the guy holding a flashlight next to Rey's lightsaber, I can tell was meant to be funny, but I don't see how it actually is so). The movie is bloated in plot and runtime, with deus ex machina (essentially Lando Calrissian's entire role in this one, besides also seemingly setting up some spin-off or paratext when he suggests an adventure with some other character in the end), red herrings, MacGuffins and plot conveniences abounding. The underlying struggle, too, as with much of the Star Wars universe, between good and evil is the epitome of banality.",0
3300,10.0,"I went knowing all of the spoilers, anticipating this to be a disaster, and boy was I wrong. Yes, it was very busy, but it needed to be after the last jedi, and definitely made up for it.",1
3301,10.0,"I was a little nervous for the viewing of this movie when I heard some of the critic reviews. However, I was not disappointed. It felt like true Star Wars to me from beginning to end. The music was superb, and I think they wrapped up the storyline very well. Most of the questions bothering me about past movies were answered and overall I am very satisfied.",1
3302,1.0,"Save your money, this not a storytelling, but just some random scenes edited together to make a complete nonsense and boring piece of %$$.<br /><br />Continuity errors all around (one moment see jumps spaceships, the other see almost falls climbing the death star). And the ""National treasure hunt"" subplot, wat was that about? And horseback riding rebels (more black stormtrooper deserters, (uhh and what about this peace of ""story"", so stormtroopers a woke millennials??)) that attack mega planet destroying spaceships, that are not in space, huh confused i am.<br /><br />So i can go on and on (hotwiring space crafts, put the blue against red wire trik)<br /><br />Stop making movies 2.5 hours full of crap, and start making good quality stories.",0
3303,7.0,"First things first.. I did enjoy the movie quite a bit. I tried to not read too much before hand and just see the movie for what it was. I think it does a good job giving most o the characters a proper send off and takes them on a decently done adventure. Nice acting, music, editing, and had some nice light moments as well.",1
3304,10.0,I have been a fan since the first movie went to the cinema in 1977.<br /><br />I don't understand the people who rated it very low. I don't know what their expectations were.<br /><br />I think the rise of Skywalker was one of the best Star Wars movies made. I loved it from the beginning till the end. Great to see the original actors again.,1
3305,8.0,"While it does not feel like George Lucas' vision of Star Wars I still enjoyed it, and I'm glad I got to experience it in the cinema.",1
3306,1.0,This film is an absolute mess. It does not qualify as a Star Wars movie in my opinion and is the most insulting thing possible to a true Star Wars movie. It is clearly a corporate fan film made by fans of the money that Star Wars used to be able to make who don't actually respect or love Star Wars. The film relies on the cheapest tactics possible and is the equivalent of taking a beloved family member and killing them and turning them into a stuffed corpse and parading them around your house in their old clothes to try and fool you while insulting you.,0
3307,5.0,"It is not easy to end a trilogy (or a...nine-ogy?). The fact that this movie mostly works, manages closure, and has some epic final moments means it did okay. That said - much like Return of the Jedi - it did not live up to its predecessors. There were a few too many callbacks, a few too many endings, and a WAY too many earnest moments when characters told the audience how they should feel and what they should learn. (Plus, the movie just kept undoing itself over and over?) More than anything, I just wanted fewer speeches and cameos. Still, Rey has been the character that made you care and cheer for a while now (and Kylo Ren was not far behind), bringing a sense of newness and familiarity that made this whole thing work. It was pretty rewarding to see the end of that journey, even if I wanted a bit more dueling and a bit less talking.",1
3308,4.0,"Neither The Force Awakens nor The Last Jedi possessed the slight of hand necessary to pull off Fantasy - given the baggage Star Wars carried with it's six prior entries. But what few victories they managed to sneak away with over the course of this new trilogy, they have surrendered with The Rise of Skywalker in hopes that - just maybe - if it's loud enough, if it's fast enough and if it's sycophantic enough to rile up evangelists, people might not notice that they never really had a story to tell.",0
3309,,Seriously this was so bad I'm assuming this is a joke right? Well if this is a joke the mousehouse messed up big time. It is like those jedi and darth Vader died for nothing. In conclusions this is a cruel and sad joke and they better admit it because this blows.,0

3313,8.0,Standard Star Wars fare with JJ Abrams styled action sequences.,0
3314,2.0,"I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 because It could have been one of the best Star Wars movies of all time if they would have followed the original plot where Finn and Ray both become jedi's and kylo ren becomes emperor after he kills snoak, then, they two new jedi's fight. With Ray being the sith and Finn being the good jedi...wouldve been an original (mostly) story, and in all likelihood a very fun 3 movies...<br /><br />But no, Kathleen Kennedy and the scumbag vp's that run disney now handed us the most convoluted movies of all time. It's so bad it can't even be watched a second time truly... To sit and watch it a second time I would have to be literally tied down to a chair it's that bad... Same with Boba Fett, they took a beloved hard as nails assassin and tried to make him a good guy...pathetic.",0
3315,4.0,It was the same exact plot as always. No build up to anything. Rey and Ren talk and fight every 10 minutes throughout the whole movie. So tired of this and so disappointed. This was the final straw for me.,0
3316,9.0,"This film was better than the eighth installment and I really liked the ending they gave to the saga quite a bit, although I did raise some doubts. The truth is that I had to see the entire saga before seeing this latest installment and I had to decipher many things based on what was seen in the previous films and thus understand much of what seemed to make no sense. Also, I found an explanation as to why Rei is a Mary Sue (spoiler alert). The movie reveals that she is Palpatine's granddaughter and I think that justifies why she has so much potential, since by watching all the movies several times, I began to notice that Palpatine was apparently calculating and he was able to deduce in a certain way a lot of what he said. It was going to happen in the saga as if he had planned everything from the beginning and clearly he spent all this time on the planet of the Sith while the sixth film's Palpatine was nothing more than a clone. Everything seen in the saga was part of Palpatine's grand plan and this movie implicitly reveals that. He even already predicted somehow (in an emergency) that if Rei was not going to take command, at least she would finish what Palpatine wanted from the beginning and that was peace in the galaxy (as he declared in episode 3) and at the It seemed to achieve this, both the Jedi, the Sith and even the lineage of Skywalker had to die and in the end that goal was achieved. Not for nothing, Palpatine was the greatest Lord of the Sith because his plan was perfect, he was very powerful, which made him a perfect Sith and it would not be strange that his granddaughter inherited that perfection, since in the real world grandchildren can inherit many characteristics from their grandparents, including personality. Anyway, I think the saga ended well, although there were some unknowns that hopefully will be answered in the next installments of the saga. My rating for this movie is 9/10.",1
3317,7.0,"A good sci-fi action adventure movie but still too similar to what has gone before and for a finale, I was expecting it to be more epic. The story flits between various locations quickly and is often followed by action scenes which means there's always something to watch and be entertained by, but the plot itself is rather light. More depth to the locations and characters would have been nice, but there are just enough reveals and new aspects to keep you interested. The acting, special effects and action scenes are good but not spectacular, and although the iconic music's still there, the imagery and impact of the struggle wasn't this time around.",1

3319,4.0,"Asinine. If I had to use one word to describe ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" it would be that, and it pains me to write that about any Star Wars movie, a franchise that I was once so passionate about.

The last 3 have sucked and enough is enough. Yes certainly Disney will issue another 10 of these, but the laws of diminishing return have been attached, clamped, stuck to Star Wars now forever. Truly 'Disney Star Wars' sucks.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is as useless as ever. She is still thin, but with short hair is even more annoying.

3357,4.0,"Let's be honest: star wars films aren't really about surprising, original plots or profound drama. There's a lot of action, some quasi soul-searching to use the force for good by the protagonist, and against the odds, good prevails against evil.",1

So now you have a sense of where I'm coming from.<br /><br />This movie looks really, really cool. Lucas apparently funneled the entire budget for a New Hope into the effects, and here it's easy to imagine that the lion's share of time & energy went into designing the look of the worlds. And man, they hit it out of the park.<br /><br />Did they sacrifice plausibility for superficial cool factor? You betcha they did, and I didn't really care, it's a space movie, not a documentary. The set pieces and some of the sequences are really beautiful and, honestly, put to better use than those in Avatar.<br /><br />It's flashy, loud, brash, occasionally stupid, but a real treat for the eyes. So if you don't mind shelling out $15 to see what is essentially the fever dream of a moody but really talented set design student, this is for you.<br /><br />If you're at all invested in the lore of Star Wars, you're likely to be disappointed.

After the pain and the suffering i experienced watching the last jedi, i was prepared for the worst. But the truth is, If i would have seen this movie without seeing the two movies before, i would have hated it and gone mad. But sadly i got desensibilized against bad star wars movies, so this one actually felt better than the orhers, especially ep8, wich is the worst insult to the star wars universe since jar jar.",0

3369,10.0,"The end So what a movie! Know that there are many shared opinions about new trilogy and about this final epic ending. Myself, I'd like to forget that ep 8 ever happened but the rise of Skywalker ends everything So good that I can have indulgence with ep 8 being called star wars say. Rise of Skywalker is an emotional mountain and coaster, going from goose bumps, to wow and then touching one at heart. They did a great job with this movie and yes it feels like they could have explained some things more and yes it will not please everyone but that is the great thing about star wars, because there are so many more, comics, books with endless stories both Canon and legend. If you do not like the latest movies read the legend books which are at least as good and have a fantastic story. Anyway, Rise of Skywalker lands in the top 4 of them best sw movies (hard to rank them right now) and by far the second best movie this year shortly after the Avengers endgame Star wars rise of Skywalker gets 10/10 an epic saying that is now nearing its end The force will always be with us",1

3371,6.0,"I remember the excitement of the original Star Wars films and the anticipation of of the original sequels, not any more, just another money spinning release living off the legend. Not that this particular film is a bad film, it's just the same as the rest of them, pretty much the same story, same action, same outcome, just the names have changed. Obviously well made and special effects are great, as they have been for over 40 years. Still I watched and enjoyed it, even though you know the very predictable outcome. But to be fair, they are never going to recreate the excitement of the original trio of films. Still, no doubt fans will flock to see it, and if there is anyone left alive who hasn't seen the original films then you'll love it.",0

3376,3.0,The worst Star Wars movie up to date. Apart from the special effects and the actors everthing was disappointing. There was no story just some random actions and the dialogue was extremly dumb. They also managed to ruin characters which were great before like Palpatine. I wish i could unsee the whole trilogy that came out these years.,0
3377,8.0,"Story is Ok with a couple of well played and quite emotional moments, visuals and the score are great and the movie does it's job fairly well. You can feel the writers tried to go nostalgic on the viewer throughout the whole movie - which worked to some degree, but was also cringy at times. There definitely were moments in the movie, that bothered me - but some things in SW movies are just standard I guess (occasional annoying character, main characters predicting things correctly most of the time, lucky coincidents, plots saved at the last moment, incredibly clumsy Stormtroopers, constant Wookie growling sounds,...). Disappointed hardcore fans scoring the movie with 1 ratings will just have to admit to themselves, they have grown up and there is absolutely NO chance, any new movie will ever give them the feelings, original trilogy has given them. And that is mostly due to their unbearable nostalgia, not the difference in quality of the SW movies.",1

Enjoy The rise of Skywalker for what it is - a great movie.",1
3394,7.0,"There is a lot going on in this movie but also it feels maybe 30 minutes too long. I think the challenge was trying to introduce the big bad into the movie and build some story there when perhaps the time for that was in the last movie. That said, it is a very cinematic experience with loads of action to enjoy. The characters of Rey and Ren both developed nicely here and it tied up the Skywalker saga as best it could. It was definitely fun to watch (though my bum got a bit numb toward the end) and I will rewatch several times upon home release.",1
3395,10.0,"I just flat out loved it. It brings a great end to not only the sequel trilogy, but the entire Skywalker saga as a whole. I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are getting at. Rise of Skywalker answers questions and ends the saga, which is the exact point of the film.",1
3396,2.0,"I'm not a major STAR WARS fan, but I'm not a stranger to it, either. I just watched episodes I to IX over the course of a couple weeks (the final trilogy for the first time). This one was the only film I didn't like. It's sloppy and rushed, full of coincidences and deux ex machina. The character arcs are forced and sudden. Deceased characters return in spades. Many STAR WARS films (of ep. I to IX) have flaws but all of them are good movies--except for RISE OF SKYWALKER. It barely feels like a STAR WARS film and more like something Marvel rushed out the factory in between SPIDERMANs. Evident here is the cash-grab mentality of Disney prioritizing profits over story. When studios see only dollar signs, a passionless mess is inevitable.",0

3401,5.0,"So this is how they ruin the memory of the greatest sci fi ever, i mean its much as if it was a cartoon of a legendary space movie fantasy empire, wich held no bounds in what could be out there and what stories there were to be told... And THIS is what they make of it, a girl who cries all the time like she has forgotten the serious times they are in and what needs to be done, i mean the WHOLE GALAXY is at stake, and she has her focus on her emotional issues and keeps giving up all clues to her adversary etc, then its has no feeling or connection to all that is happening in the plot, it just happens thats all deal with it, and dont forget the bad comedy moments and parody encrusted pop ups by old heroes from the real movies that actually had some feeling and was serious... its all just a joke from DISNEY, its for kids basically and the cartoon versions of Starwars prob have more seriousness in them from being actual cartoons wich puts it in to plain light what it is so u can take as is, but this is just cheating<br /><br />few points for atleast keeping the tale alive and the hero pop ups, but the new crew are kindergarden actors, sorry",0

3405,10.0,"The movie is far from being perfect, but the task of JJ was a absolute nightmare not to mention almost impossible after that mess of ""The Last Jedi"", so it's fair to say JJ did the possible to make episode IX work and it does most of the time, I know that the first 40 minutes are very convoluted and a little mess but what did you aspect after Rian Johnson stupid plot? The second act it's in my opinion very good and thrilling with some amazing cinematography and action sequences, not to mention the soundtrack just AMAZING like always. The third act it's ok, good in my opinion some elements will divide the fans but which movie since the prequels didn't divide the Fans? All in all it's a good farewell to the Skywalker Saga, I strongly believe this is the best movie of the Disney era the best of the sequel trilogy, I give it a 8 out of 10, but since we have some stupid haters giving this movie 1 only because, I give it a 10 to equalize the odds. PLEASE don't listen to them go and watch the movie decide for yourself you won't regret it, the movie is not perfect but as I said it's a good conclusion to the saga.",1
3406,1.0,"Everyone knew this movie had to deal with the Last Jedi train wreck of a story line, however the golden rule for a sequel is to leave the original story and heroes alone. This did the opposite. This movie completely makes the original 6 movies irrelevant and it's an insult to the Skywalker story. The even more powerful Mary Sue Rey is now the new chosen one because she chooses to identify as a Skywalker even though she's a Palpatine. Oh... and Palpatine is back making Anakin's sacrifice and prophecy meaningless. This movie is just 2.5 hours of garbage exposition, uninspired writing, stolen plot points from ROTJ/Avengers, destruction of original character arcs, and really nice specials effects/scenery (I'll give them that). I honestly don't understand how there are people that actually liked this...",0
3407,2.0,"It's an okay film, but a horrible Star Wars film and an even worse sequel to TLJ. I mean, the visuals look great and the music is terrific. But the story makes absolutely no sense, not on its own and even less as a sequel to TLJ. The plot, which is basically a McGuffin hunt, is like the film version of a very bad video game. All the legendary Star Wars characters like, C3PO, Leia, Chewie and Luke (as a force ghost) are so completely off character, it's a shame. Their behaviour is neither consistent to TLJ nor to the original trilogy. Thanks Rian Johnson and J. J. Abrams for destroying a franchise which inspired millions of people worldwide.",0

Hard to say for sure given that I was 6-7 when I saw the first one and 44 now but I'm pretty blown out with it for sure.",1

Except this time you have a fleet of massive ships that can't move unless a beacon is activated.... Yes thats right, somehow the old emperor has managed to manufacture thousands of star destroyers, with little to no resources at hand, then leaves them stranded and unable to move under their own power unless this so called beacon is turned on. It's utterly ridiculous.",0
3411,1.0,They ride horses in space. In a space battle. HAHAHA. This movie is such a joke. I stopped caring after the second movie when I cried out of disappointment. This movie is so ridiculously bad and so is the rating. The reviews are gold tho.,0

3415,8.0,"To my tired eyes, I think ""Star Wars"" is showing its age (for a film series that began all the way back in 1977), even though ""Star Wars"" is essentially timeless and aside from superficial trappings (like the quality of the special effects, which still hold up in the face of today's overblown CGI), there is nothing that truly dates these films. But it does seem that all the best and most original and compelling storytelling for the ""Star Wars"" series went out with the original trilogy from 1977-1983. That's why the long-awaited sequel series seems like kind of a rehash, and a fan-boy tribute, to the grand legacy of films past. J.J. Abrams's 2019 ""Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker"" is not immune to this dreaded weakness that has hounded the sequel series since it began in 2015 with ""The Force Awakens."" But the first hour or so, I was quite involved in the story here, despite a few hiccups and missed opportunities to make the story even more deeper and make it stand out from the past two entries, which to my tired eyes, were somewhat lackluster and didn't reach the high expectations that accompanied their releases. But overall, I felt that the film ended on a fitting note, right where it began. ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" was the one film in the sequel trilogy that I was most impressed with, and that's why I felt it brought the series to a decent closure.",1

Even if you ignore some awful CGI and the terrible Leia thing, the movies plot, realism and any empthy for the characters disappeares before the end. Big action movie for the dumbed down generation.",0

3421,5.0,"We all know after watching this movie that Disney never had a roadmap for this trilogy. While I felt it was a bit of a cop-out to bring back Palpatine so late in the series, I doubt this was the original plan. There are several moments in this movie that directly counter things said and done in The Last Jedi (ie. Rey being a Palpatine, and Luke's force ghost telling her to treat her lightsaber with respect). Those parts I can appreciate since they are retconning some of the many ""plot-subversions"" TLJ is known for. Honestly it seems like JJ was trying to fit in his version of episode 8 and episode 9 into one movie, and the pacing suffers for it. The script was somewhat by-the-numbers, but nothing overtly bad that isn't immediately noticeable (I'll have to go and watch it again probably). But overall, I didn't HATE this movie, but I don't know it I LIKED it yet. There are many subplots set up in The Force Awakens that pretty much get abandoned here, Finn's arc being one of them. Now it's not like they never addressed it after Ep 7, but they never really moved past ""yeah he's a storm trooper who defected, that's his character"". Other than those, and I'm sure there are a few other things that I didn't catch, the movie is ok for a sit-through with some friends to make it worth it.",0
3422,5.0,"Well if you don't...it was a phenomenal TV show that quickly became horrible because after the first few seasons, the writers made it up as they went along. The ending still confuses and angers fans to this day. Guess who directed it? It was JJ! Well he did the same thing to Star Wars.",0

But none of the original trilogy movies are either. The Rise of Skywalker is a load of fun with great twists and surprises. It's an incredibly satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga. Rey and Ben have earned their place among the timeless characters of Star Wars. Go in with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",1

3438,7.0,"First of all, it's disappointing to see any objective look at this movie become marred by agendas on both sides of the fanbase's spectrum. Despite what some fans might want you to believe- no, The Rise of Skywalker isn't a failure or a disaster- neither is it a masterpiece or even a particularly memorable entry in the saga. As the ending to the sequel trilogy that started with The Force Awakens- it serves its purpose just fine. And I really mean fine, I still think there are a lot of missed opportunities when it came to this trilogy. But, as a movie that serves to answer some of the questions that were brought up in The Force Awakens and went completely unanswered in The Last Jedi, it delivers- albeit introducing some of its own unanswered mysteries in the process, which is sort of frustrating for the last movie in the saga.",0
3439,6.0,"It had to be the great film, because it was the end of Skywalker's saga, that continued for 40 years. I don't know what was in the head of screenwriters, but it is the worst film in all Star Wars ever. Of course, the visual effects is great, music is a awesome too, because author is genius John Williams. That's all good features if this film. There are a lot of illogical moments from the beginning to the rinal fight. The film tried to use old characters like Palpatine and princess Organa for taking interest of fans, but they forgot, that the fans are very sensitive to canon of saga<br /><br />So, it's average Disney film that connected with Star Wars.",1
3440,4.0,"LOVED the last two movies and had higher hopes for this one, particularly after where TLJ left us. But this movie just crushed all my expectations to dust. It's unnecessary nostalgia with lousy story and predictable plot twists a few of which were so obvious that my 7 year old was discreetly whispering it in my ear before each was manifest on the screen. It is still a Star Wars movie so it will be watched and tons of money will be generated for the studio, but nothing of substance for a true fan.",0

You have to give them some credit - it's very difficult finishing something legendary like Star Wars. They have a huge challenge in front of them. I think this was, by far, the best of the 3! I love what they did with the characters and the plot twists. I have to say that I have a new favorite Star Wars character after watching this ;-). Well done! Whatever doubts I had about a good finale, were all settled! Very impressive!!! A must see!!!",1
3450,9.0,First off I wanted to say if you're reading reviews before seeing don't! Go in with a fresh mind set and not worrying other peoples dislikes for the movie and view it with your own eyes and think about it with your own brain. I love this movie! It was tons better than the last jedi. Almost as good as the force awakens. This movie not only ties the sequel trilogy together it ties the rest of the movies too. It has some good fan service and fixes issues the last jedi created. Palpatine was menacing. Rey and kylos lightsaber duels on the second death star and on his star destroyer via force link were angry filled and very action packed. My only gripe is kylos death in the end. I felt they didnt give him a good sign off. Just poof dead and done. He deserved to stand there with his family as force ghosts at the end on tatooine. Other than that I enjoyed it and will see it many more times as I have the other movies.,1
3451,10.0,The Rise of Skywalker brings the balance that started with A New Hope. A long wait to see how truly powerful the Sith and Jedi are in the universe. J. J. Abrams shows perfectly how strong the Sith are and how strong Darth Sidious is in the universe. There were times when I started believing in Sith ways.<br /><br />The best tribute given to Carrie Fisher for bringing Princess Leia to life and to Han Solo.<br /><br />Loved the movie. I'm gonna miss the Skywalker Saga and will show my kids how great George Lucas creation was.<br /><br />Thank you Star Wars.,1
3452,1.0,The story is a joke. I don't care about the characters as the chemistry between them feels forced. TLJ is even more pointless now.,0

3454,1.0,This movie was so bad that my eyes hurt. It's full of visual effects but there is no story. It was like watching 2019 youtube rewind. Actions scenes was too much and pointless.,0
3455,3.0,"First let's give credit to JJ for trying to fix the mess Rian made, Rey was always planned to be of this bloodline (the clues were in her fighting style and music). However what can't be forgiven is ruining Anakin's storyline by bringing back the Emperor. It makes sense that Snoke loved the Empire and would want to restore it's former glory by finding a descendant of the Emperor and to use her to strike down and kill his unfavored apprentice Ben Solo. Ben was of the disgraced family who betrayed the Empire and killed the Emperor, so Snoke would want to have Rey kill him and bring back the glory of the Empire under the Palpatine name. So if JJ establishes in the opening moments of this film that Snoke is a clone then why is it necessary to bring back the Emperor and ruin Anakin Skywalker's story? That's where this story fails. I commend JJ for trying to fix his trilogy after Rian Johnson ruined it (Holdo maneuver, never throw away light saber, Luke apologizes for his behavior, Snoke cloning), but by bringing back the Emperor JJ ruined Lucas's trilogy. In fixing his own trilogy, JJ ruined a much more beloved trilogy story.",0
3456,8.0,Yes it's a bit rushed and there are some elements that don't work (all of Carrie Fisher's scenes) or are a bit rubbish (hyperspace skipping thing) but there's so much in this film I did enjoy. The action scenes were incredible and the story was pretty good. It was emotional and nostalgic. As the last film in a 42 year franchise it's never going to pull up trees and reinvent the wheel but it does what you'd expect.,1
3457,2.0,"A complete waste of time<br /><br />boring boring boring.<br /><br />No real plot, digging up old ideas and old characters.<br /><br />No spark of the force<br /><br />no good jokes<br /><br />save your money",0
3458,9.0,"Listening or reading others critics could be really deceiving. I born 70s consider myself partly grew up together in SW. Missed the first day of the movie released last week(normally i catch all new films and write my thoughts right away) so i read the reviews. Bad reviews majority claiming that this one has lost the grip and detoured from Mr Lucas intention. That really made me sad and at one point i chose to believe and decide not to watch it in the cinema. However, i did it today and my take is 9/10. It is entertaining and since this is a fictional, why bother how the story go? It has got a very beautiful ending. The young jedi has certainly improved way better than the last episode. Leia CGI is far natural than herself to what i think. All the main characters are more matured.. Solo and Luke are good that they didn't make up any jokes unlike the previous chapters. As for the villains, however the story may put by reinstating the dead.. it is just a part of the story goes.",1

3460,10.0,"I loved it, my family loved it, the whole cinema we were in loved it. I don't get the hate. I enjoyed the last Jedi, but this was better. This one was just brilliant. Go and see it. Star Wars is such a big and enjoyable part of my life, has been for 42 years. I am so happy.",1
3461,5.0,"There were, indeed, some amazing scenes in this movie but at the end I felt so sad that the Star Wars saga ended this way. The ridiculous plot choices and the complete disregard for what had gone before hit me the most. The Star Wars universe was so special to me and now it is just a money grabbing enterprise. I recently heard that ""The big action movies these days are indeed for children and China"". I agree. It is, sadly, so true.",0
3462,8.0,"Well that's supposedly the end of it all. No spoilers but it had it all, a few parts where I rolled my eyes. However still bloody enjoyable, will need to watch again to pick up all the little nuggets.",1
3463,7.0,"I quite enjoyed 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It was never going to be what everyone wanted it to be, especially after the state that Rhian Johnson left Star Wars in after that diabolical previous movie.<br /><br />JJ had his work cut out to save the saga. There were a few silly little bickery jokes between characters at times that there was no need for.<br /><br />It didn't explain how Maz had Luke's lightsaber or how the Emperor had been cloned.<br /><br />Some people are moaning about not knowing what Finn wanted to say to Rey but I couldn't care less and it had no bearing on the movie.<br /><br />I my eyes there have only been 2 sequels, this and Force Awakens as episode 8 was THAT BAD.",0
3464,1.0,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but I couldn't. First of all, it was completely aimless. It introduced completely new elements to the story out of nowhere. The plot had nothing to do with the previous movie in the triology. For the same reason, I think, nothing in this movie was show and tell. In several scenes, a character had to be explaining what was actually going on in order for it to make sense.<br /><br />The movie had way too much humor, which took any seriousness out of the situation.<br /><br />It also made no hard decisions - did not commit to or contribute with anything. On the other hand it was overly depending on old star wars nostalgia.<br /><br />Visually, the movie was cool of course, but I don't think this makes it up for what the movie lacks in story.",0

3466,6.0,"I think it's important to start my review of The Rise of Skywalker (TROS) by saying that I was a huge fan of The Last Jedi (TLJ) as I think that is relevant to my feelings about the final installation in the Skywalker saga. I'm also a big Star Wars fan and have been since watching A New Hope/Episode 4 at the age of about 7. Going in to watch TROS I was expecting several of Rian Johnson's intelligent choices to be reversed, but the extent this happened did detract from my ability to appreciate the film on its own merits. So, I went to see it again and tried hard to leave my feelings about TLJ at the door, and I hope I'm now able to make a fair assessment of the film.",1
3467,9.0,Are there issues... Of course every movie has them. Did I love this movie .. yes. I live that 40 years feels like it's come full circle. Love that everyone got an ending and a beginning. I loved the way they sent of Carry Fisher not in a cloying CGI fest but in a way that brought a much loved character and actor an ending they disserved. Dont listen to the reviews go see the film and make your mind up. I did for all of them. There were the good the bad and the mediocre this one is neither bad or medicore. If you love star wars this is the one to see,1
3468,10.0,"Some of the ""fans"" of Star Wars movies don't disserve that excelent movie! From alpha to omega the movie is Incredible! The plot, the directory,the actors' performance, the photography! We needed a good movie, a good Star Wars movie and believe me here it is!",1

3470,5.0,"I remember leaving the theater thinking ""at least it wasn't as bad as TLJ""... This trilogy seems awfully tone deaf and uncreative on Disney's part. JJ Abrams wanted to rehash the originals, and Rian Johnson seemed like he heard about star wars a week before he started directing it. I really wanted to like these movies, but it seems apparent they were made solely as a cash grab without containing any memorable content other than cheap jokes and flashing explosions in space. I feel like I'm being pushed out of the door of star wars fandom after seeing these movies.. seeing what the franchise has become, I am fine with that.",0
3471,10.0,"This movie is perfection. Haters are just that, trolls.",0
3472,7.0,"You just can not please everybody, especially not with Star Wars. At this point, no matter what they came up with, it would have been teared to pieces, just like this, all in all good movie experience.",1
3473,3.0,"It really doesn't make any sense. That's by far the worst star wars product ever created.<br /><br />The editing is epileptic, the characters are as bad as you can imagine, but the most awful thing is the plot: it destroys everything you know about Star Wars, about the power of the Jedi, the balance brought by Anakin, EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Absolutely disgusting.<br /><br />The only great thing is Buba Frik, he reminds me of myself at parties",0
3474,2.0,I'm not sure who is giving all of this high praise and positive reviews for this movie because this is not the Star Wars I grew up with. Seems like someone completely reimagined the story and slapped the name Star Wars on there. I hate how much Hollywood directors give in to far left political activists and this just one of the examples how it didn't work. Everyone in the theater I was in was laughing so we didn't get angry. I felt like I was watching a really bad Star Wars Parody. It's sad how they butchered one of the greatest Stories of all time.,0
3475,6.0,"There are two ways to watch this film. You can read the negative reviews and go in with preconceived notions. Or, what I would suggest, watch it with an open mind. The choice is yours.<br /><br />Episode 9 opens with the return of Emperor Palpatine, the big bad guy of Star Wars who was killed by the hands of Anakin Skywalker back in the original trilogy. The resistance sends Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewie, and C-3PO on a mission to find a Sith wayfinder, a device that should show them where Palpatine has been hiding this whole time. The mission escalates with Rey discovering that Palpatine is her grandfather, and that Kylo Ren thinks that together they can kill him to rule the galaxy together. The party is led to a moon of Endor where the wreckage of the second Death Star has fallen, and here, Rey and Kylo duel over the ruins. Leia creates a force connection with her son, which petrifies him for just a second, allowing Rey to stab him but sadly the connection deemed too great an effort and Leia was killed in the process. The climax of the movie is sadly not nearly as good as the second act. The final battle is split into two parts: the resistance pilots battling against Palpatine's fleet of planet killing star destroyers, and Rey and the redeemed Ben Solo taking on Palpatine himself. This battle ends with Rey defeating Palpatine, but losing her life in the process. Ben force heals Rey, sacrificing his life for hers.<br /><br />I hate to say it but this movie does not do a lot of our beloved characters justice.<br /><br />Rey does develop into a better trained Jedi, but we don't really get to see that in the film. It was nice to see her struggling with the dark side, although its not a concept we have never seen in the other trilogies, but it does make her character a little less perfect than she comes off in the other films.<br /><br />Finn was great in The Force Awakens. His character was important to the plot, he was exciting and had a lot going for him, he was arguably one of the better characters in episode 7. It was clear Rian Johnson didn't really have any plans for him in The Last Jedi, and he was kinda thrown to the side, but in The Rise of Skywalker, it felt like even JJ didn't know what to do with him.<br /><br />I do have to say Adam Driver has carried the sequel trilogy for the past half decade. Kylo Ren easily has the best character arc in the sequel trilogy, but also one of the best in the entire saga. It was clear to me that this was JJ's plan ever since episode 7 for Ben Solo.<br /><br />Palpatine returning was a very interesting choice. Part of me really enjoyed having him back on screen, but the other part of me thinks the movie would have been more intense if Kylo remained evil and was the true villain of trilogy.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like about The Rise of Skywalker, was that it introduced too many new characters. The problem with introducing new characters in the final installment of a series of movies is that it is impossible to become attached to them before the end.<br /><br />Despite the fast pace, sloppy writing, and unsatisfying final battle, there were a lot of things I loved in this movie. Harrison Ford returning as Han was a pleasant surprise, even if it was just for one scene. The score did a great job at giving the viewers a sense of nostalgia. This is especially heard in the scene where Luke is lifting his old X-wing out of the water and we hear the same song heard back in Empire when Yoda does the same, and when Rey is venturing through the Death Star and we hear Vader's theme hidden in the score. One of the most rememberable scenes in the entire trilogy is when Rey hears the voices of dead Jedi. These voices include: Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), Obi-wan Kenobi (both Ewan McGregor and Alec Guinness), Yoda (Frank Oz), Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), Mace Windu (Sam L. Jackson) and many more from the animated shows.<br /><br />The action in this movie, sadly, wasn't anything special. The biggest fight was a duel between Rey and Kylo Ren on the ruins of the Death Star. This battle is particularly interesting because there is no score backing it up for almost half of the fight. This fight was also very cool because we never see Jedi blocking other lightsabers with the force and we finally got to see it in this battle.<br /><br />While this isn't the worst Star Wars movie, it is far from the best. The critics tore this movie apart, but if you are a fan of Star Wars, you will enjoy it. JJ really made this movie for the true fans of Star Wars. While it's not the best film in the saga, it does offer a satisfying conclusion to those who have been with it since the beginning. I give this epic finale to the Star Wars saga a 6.9/10.",1
3476,5.0,Narrative and tonal mess. Too many uninteresting subplots. Poorly paced and directed. A slog to get through. Uninteresting action sequences. Cool wide shots here and there but overall dull. Squanders a ton of opportunities.,0
3477,1.0,This movie fails on every possible thing.I would give it 0/10 if i could its travesty same as Last Jedi.Complete failure of stolen ideas and con artistry.Offcourse any potential this movie could have was also ruined by Rian Johnson in prequel!,0

You have one job in this industry, ENTERTAIN! You're all well overpaid to play pretend. You should at least try to be good at it. Bottom line, I was not entertained. Do I get my money back? No... No I don't get my money back. Maybe exotic auto makers should adopt this policy. Then y'all can see how it feels to buy junk! This film is junk!",1
3483,7.0,I went into this movie with low expectations after the fiasco of The Last Jedi. My first feelings after getting out of the cinema were okay. It was better than I expected and I think they did quite a decent job repairing some of the flaws of episode 8.

3487,4.0,"A wonky, bloated film that feels like director JJ Abrams was trying to fit his Episode 8 and 9 into a single film. This movie bites off more than it can chew. It's practical effects and locations were fantastic, but unexplored. The score is perfect, in every sense of the word and carries the film at every beat. There were truly some funny and heartfelt moments, but they were weighed down by recycled plot points and uninspired action. It's not Game of Thrones bad, but it's not Endgame good.

The plot was boring and nonsensical, there was no character development, yet there were a bunch of characters introduced that had no purpose.

They try their best to use the old characters to lend the new ones some weight and in doing so are sacrificed on the alter of blandness.

Overall ep 7-9 is not a beforehand well planned trilogy but just one that was built one piece here one piece there when the corporate comes up any idea how to milk the franchise. Ep 9 tried to correct the mess of Ep 8, which was diverted too far away in the casino scene and too obscure for its overall story telling, by providing fan services, reintroducing as many elements from the original franchise as possible and even copying some of the original plots. But overall the story is so hollow and not even emotional where Ben just turned good again in a second. By reintroducing the Emperor, it makes the completeness of the original franchise messy as Anakin is no longer the chosen one who brought balance to the force.

3531,8.0,"This was a great conclusion to the Star Wars saga. There were a few details that did not make since and seemed to be added to the Star Wars saga to make JJ Abrams movie work for his story. Like Princess Leia training for a Jedi?? When did that happen?<br /><br />Then Rey being the granddaughter of Senator Palpatine, her being the daughter of Obi-Wan makes more sense.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams does not disappoint, it is non stop action, it does not slow down at all, novelists to the Star Wars movies will really love #9. But for someone like myself who has seen every Star Wars movie (on opening day) it is a little disappointing.",0

3534,9.0,So let's start with The last Jedi. I hated it and I thought it ruined Star Wars forever with no chance of a salvage. Short and sweet there. I went into see TROS only because as a self proclaimed super fan I felt I had to.<br /><br />I had zero hopes for it and from the start a slight grin turned into a smile and as the film went on this was followed by some strong felt emotions. I would like to give a heart felt thanks to JJ for saving this franchise for me.<br /><br />I thought this film was amazing. Like all films it had it's silly parts of the story but overall for me Star Wars has been saved and it made me fall in love with the franchise once again for a third time.<br /><br />My advice to new viewers would be ignore the bad reviews and go with an open mind and make your own decision. What was personal to me may not be for you but I loved it.,1
3535,5.0,"I am not a true Star Wars fan, but I am certain the real fans will be pretty happy with this movie, and that is how it should be. 8 fowled things up for the true fans and this one (9) undoes some of that damage.

3536,5.0,"I think J.J. setup some really interesting things in VII and had a clear idea of what he wanted in the series. After Johnson said ""no"" to everything in VIII, J.J. has tried to salvage what he could of his vision, try to continue where Johnson left off, and try (too hard, I think) to bring all the nostalgia of the entire saga to an epic end.",0

Daisy Ridley and Adam driver, amongst many others, are fantastic and captivating.

3542,8.0,"The first hour is very rushed and fast, you don't get to connect to anything and Carrie Fisher is forced into the early parts of the movie. Her dialogue doesn't even fit and she says stuff that is so random. Also they jump through planets and scene very fast during the first hour. You see an old face in the very beginning of the film, and they did a bad job of explaining how he is even still alive after all this time, and why there was not even a slight mention of him or hint of his return in the early parts. This just proves that they had no idea what to do and just pulled stuff from random places. The trilogy wasn't well planned, unlike the prequels where Lucas knew exactly how each character was going to end up at the end of EP3.",0

3546,10.0,"The Original Trilogy is still the best Star Wars Trilogy, in my opinion. However, the Sequel Trilogy is better than the Prequel Trilogy, in my opinion. Waaaaay too many people are being too hard on the Sequels/Sequel Trilogy. And before you go regarding my review as ""unhelpful"", hear me out. I'm going to start by saying that no Star Wars film is perfect. There hasn't been a truly GREAT Star Wars film since 1980 (The Empire Strikes Back), in my opinion. 40 years ago. Return Of The Jedi ? No. It featured little cuddly looking Ewoks beating up armed and armored storm troopers with little sticks and rocks. Lol. These storm troopers and such were supposed to be a part of Palpatine's ""entire legion"" of his ""best troops"". Boba Fett goes out in a completely slapstick comedy Wile E. Coyote type of way. All of the slapstick Ewok comedy and burp gags and so on. I still like Return Of The Jedi overall but my point is it's faaar from perfect and if it came out today, that film would be slammed and bashed into onlivion. The Prequels..The Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones are almost completely unwatchable and despite it being the best of the Prequel Trilogy, in my opinion, Revenge Of The Sith still has a lot of the same problems that the first two Prequel Trilogy films have..just to a lesser degree. However, I never harassed George Lucas or Ahmed Best or Jake Lloyd..but the toxic part of the Star Wars fanbase did. I didn't like what George Lucas started doing to the Original Trilogy with all of his ""updated"" special editions. Again though, I never harassed him and sent him hate mail and such. The toxic part of the fanbase ran him off though and he sold Star Wars/LucasFilm to Disney. There were other reasons he sold to Disney but that was one of the bigger reasons. Then the Sequels started being made and the cycle continues, the Sequels are getting hated and bashed and such. A few of the actors and both directors have been harassed online and such. The Sequel Trilogy isn't perfect by any means but it's an improvement over the Prequel Trilogy, in my opinion. Rogue One and Solo are also pretty good and fun films. None of the warrants the hate and such they've gotten. Toxic Star Wars fans take the fun out of Star Wars. They try to make as many people as possible hate the films like they do. It's not ""Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans""..it's ""Nobody hates Star Wars more than toxic Star Wars fans"".",1

3552,7.0,"Just coming back from the theatre, i can say with confidence this was time well spent, and it is a highly enjoyable movie if watched on the big screen. Visuals are fantastic, CGI is there but not disturbing at all (and hugely contributes to the overall atmosphere), while the music/audio fits the scenes perfectly. Great stuff!<br /><br />Much of the mess created by the previous movies is now addressed, so some very crucial questions are answered at last. Fin's character is finally tuned down a notch, and thus improving it a lot, so much so that I almost started to like the guy by the end :) Story is better for most parts than in the previous films (well, the bar wasn't exactly high), though some of the ""twists"" still made my eyes turn in their sockets. Still, if only this kind and level of attention went to Force Awakens...which still stands on 7.9, btw. I think the scores do not do justice here: this movie is punished because of the impact left on disappointed fans by the previous installments, while those are still rated high because at their release the hype (and anticipation) was still high. This is just speculation of course, but I honestly believe that The Rise of Skywalker is not a bad movie, and that it definitely deserves a chance.",1

3555,8.0,"I saw The Last Skywalker today. I had low expectations. I dislike some of the choices made for the last two movies and so didn't expect to like this one much. I ended up thinking it was the best of the last three movies. It was really good. I think most of what happened was appropriate and made sense based on what happened in the past two films (including the things I didn't like). And I realized all three trilogies basically end with a significant death. Despite any victories along the way, each trilogy, taken as a whole, is basically a Shakespearean tragedy.",1
3556,2.0,"Yes...Disney's hand is clearly in the mix. What we have here is an appeal to nostalgia and the generations that watched the 1st trilogy and the 2nd trilogy. You see, the 3rd trilogy has not created a massive amount of new fans. The generation Z (post Milenials) don't give much a thought about Star Wars. For them, Marvel has covered that hole.",1
3557,10.0,"I will start my review by saying that,before the release of the movie,I didn't saw any spoilers nor have I read or seen other people's reviews because most of them had the same idea about the movie where as some of the audience/fans had a different idea.<br /><br />So,as a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise,I decided to watch the movie without asking for a friend's opinion about the film.<br /><br />I'm glad I did that because now I have my own opinion about the film and that opinion is that Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is the perfect finale for the hole Star Wars franchise and for that we have to thanks J.J. Abrams.<br /><br />I think that J.J. Abrams did a fantastic job of saving The Star Wars franchise after Rian Johnson almost destroyed it with his Star Wars version called ""Star Wars The Last Jedi"".<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong,I didn't hate his movie but I thought that,for a Star Wars film,it was just ok.<br /><br />What I didn't liked or loved too much is the fact that Ben Skywalker had to gave his life in order to save Rey from dying.<br /><br />The thing that I loved the most about ""The Rise of Skywalker"",besides the plot,the cast as well as the CGI effects,are the tons of references to almost all the Star Wars movies/Tv shows.<br /><br />Overall,if you're a huge fan of The Star Wars franchise and if you want to see the finale of the Star Wars franchise than you must watch J.J.

3568,7.0,"This entire movie was pretty much the sixth one recreated. Poe was Han, Rey was Luke with Leia's personality, Chewbacca was Chewbacca, C3PO was himself as always, and same with Lando. Finn was pretty much the only new character. The 6th one however, is one of my favorite movies, and I think they ended the saga on a pretty good note. There were good characters and many Easter eggs. Also, the acting wasn't that bad for once. I found myself actually enjoying a movie. I'm only taking off one star because one of the scenes that happened at the end. (But no spoilers)",0

Even Adam Driver can't save it thou he is as ever the most interesting charismatic believeable actor around. Its vacuous and I feel angry after watching it. I went back recently and watched force awakens. How did that promise turn to this?! Even last Jedi feels not so bad second time round. I wouldn't watch this again. At least the Mandalorian is doing something right, JJ should've looked to that as am sad to say this film is so disappointing to me when expected a lot from this.",0
3571,6.0,"I liked the dark tone of it, and if there's a character they brought to this universe worth being remembered is Kylo Ren. Other than him, the shining ones are the oldies.<br /><br />Also the movie seemed to ignore the character development Rian Johnson did (if any at all), making Poe and Fin more mature and giving them a purpose.<br /><br />On the other hand, i seriously desliked the use and abuse of lightspeed (if i remember correctly the Millenium Falcon always had issues jumping to lightspeed, and now i don't remember seeing it failing one single time), aswell as the reviving power of the force, which appeared in this movie and was used 3 times...<br /><br />Glad Rey finally learned how to handle a lightsaber, the comedy was acceptable and not so much out of place like TLJ, scenarios are incredible and music folds with the scenes flawlessly.<br /><br />I'm sure it wasn't easy to take control of this last episode after the mess Rian did with TLJ, but JJ was able to deliver something, even if it has no place next to the originals.<br /><br />Out from the 3 is the best one (i did not like Force Awakens), but this is not the universe i used to love.",1

It added something new not only for entertaining, but something to think about. Should we ever judge people for something they have not done yet? Can anybody be lost forever?<br /><br />The actor who played Kylo was exellent in his role. I also like Rey and her story, her unusual powers got a good explanation. On the other hand there was not much else interesting going on in this part. Everything else felt like an edless side quest, it was too long, messy and did not add anything important to the story. Also...why kill so many great characters? When they die so often it does not really feel realistic, it feels like it was only done to add dramatism. Sorry, but cheap move.<br /><br />Overall 7 stars.

I stand by my critiques below, but I have to admit that watching the movie as a whole, those nitpicks did not ruin my enjoyment this time around, and I actually felt great leaving the theatre. My opinion on the treatment of Kylo Ren in this movie stands - because I believe his role in the final act and conclusion of his character arc could have been handled better. But ultimately, I liked this movie a whole lot better than I did the first time, largely because I did not walk into the second viewing with the expectation that every little thing I ever wanted from this trilogy would occur. I went in as a fan of the Star Wars universe and lore, and I walked away satisfied. Therefore, I am doubling my original review score. Because a 4/10 came from a place of personal disappointment.

After directing ""The Force Awakens"" and leaving it to Rian Jonhson to lead ""The Last Jedi"", who incidentally had already written an outline for the script for this last part of the story, JJ Abrams is back after Kathleen Kennedy, responsible from Disney throughout the Star Wars franchise. Abrams, while the film strives to do something very different and break some fan expectations in the first two thirds of the film, there is also a huge effort to make a remake of ""Return of the Jedi"" at the end of it. Anyone who values the boldness of Rian Johnson, who angered many fans with his comment about breaking expectations in a franchise based on serving them, can easily reverse his speech to The Rise of Skywalker, which at no time is concerned with surprising, yet that many twists and turns make up its plot.",1

Also also How hard is it to be consistent with the amount of damage a weapon makes.

The story is ridiculed with dialogue that only serves to propose a hero line in order to make you feel something, and quite frankly, it made me feel sad. Sad that my favorite movie franchise has been grinded down to the bone. I wish George Lucas had never sold Star Wars to Disney.",0
3602,2.0,"Most of the plot in this film makes little sense if you think a bit about it. The characters have lost any sense of edginess or originality. The good guys win, hardly anyone dies, the story jumps around the universe without purpose. the special effects are bad because every scene looks fake. The toughness of the original sets is gone. It's become a mindless kids film by Disney. The transition to the dark side is complete. What utter rubbish!",0
3603,10.0,"I don't understand why people says it's a bad movie. It follows what the original trilogy has set up : the conflict between the light side and the dark side, Skywalker vs Palpatine. I can see why people might say that it lacks a bit of originality. VII is kind of like IV, VIII like V and IX like VI. But Rey has true character development throughout the trilogy and the surprise that she was a Palpatine was good twist. And to see that she finally got someone back from the dark side shows that she grew strong with the force. Yes, there's new things we see that the force can do, it shows us that the characters have mastered the force beyonf what we knew (Yes, Yoda was strong, but maybe not the strongest). A lot people hate this movie because there a lot of new things, but at the same time, the hate the movie because it takes some existing elements from the previous movies. I just don't understand. If you're close-minded, yes, every new film will be bad.",1

3605,8.0,"Minor Spoilers Bellow:<br /><br />My few cons of the film would be the title and reys final line; she is of desent of Palpentine not Skywalker, also the kiss was silly should have been a friendship moment if she is a so called skywalker she kissed a realtive. Also Kylo died, why didnt he become a force ghost, also the whole thing of Palpantine was confusing but enjoyable to watch. there was a decent ending here to a great series.<br /><br />Also the knights of ren didnt play much of a role in it, if they are force sensitive it would have been cool for them to have red sabers, also the call backs to han and luke were well done, same with carrie fisher. Fights were once again entertaining but the physical chero was poor, same moves over and over, rey turning, rey turning, rey turning, what about some force moves, or kicks, or punches?",1
3606,10.0,"No, it's not George Lucas' Starwars and it's not suppose to be. It's a new trilogy building off the old ones.

3607,3.0,"The only thing i can say is, that george lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy is not the worst prequel anymore",0
3608,1.0,"I went into this movie nervous, I already knew that the opinions were divided, so I knew that it was up to me to decide for myself whether I liked this movie or not. So, did I like it or dislike it? Neither.<br /><br />I hate this movie. This is not Star Wars. I mean maybe it is, but it's not a movie. It's a 2 and a half hour long commercial stunt made to sell toys. There was no story, there was no passion and there was no finesse. They had 250 million dollars to make this movie and it looked cheap, it was terribly shot and there was no plot.<br /><br />Star Wars doesn't have to be perfect or an axiom of cinematic history, but it has to do something good. This movie doesn't. It's bad, just bad. It felt as if JJ Abrams read fan theories and fiction online and wrote a script around it.<br /><br />People complained about not getting to know Snokes background in Episode 8 and I understand that. But doing what they did in this movie, I think most people would agree that his backstory would have been much more intriguing and better off if it had been left in the dark. Reys origins is another example of them messing around with things which they don't understand. Instead of making a well made film which builds on it's predecessors interesting and well thought out, although divise, story, they hijack everything we saw in this new trilogy so they could ""satisfy"" fans. Nobody is happy and if they are, it won't be for long before they realize what they have actually witnessed.<br /><br />Some even say that the acting was good. I respectfully and strongly disagree. You could just see it in Adam Drivers face during the scenes that he knew that he had better things to do. And he does. John Boyega didn't land too far away from the same tree. With poor dialogue and bad scripting, I pity the cast, this is what they were given, at the end of the day, it's not their fault.<br /><br />And I felt fooled by the marketing of this film. The TV spots teased us with awesome soundtrack hits from John Williams of the original and prequel trilogy, but none were heard in the movie. This proves my point. JJ Abrams and Kennedy don't understand Star Wars and what makes it special. They see what it is and what the cover of its thick and thoughtful book looks like, but they don't know how to read what's actually written on the inside. The Williams score is a character by itself, as much as Luke, Leia and Han. Rian Johnson understood that, providing us with the best Star Wars soundtrack ever recorded in The Last Jedi. The soundtrack in The Rise of Skywalker is forgettable and bland. Tasteless in fact. And it's not John Williams's fault, he did the best he could've done with what was given to him.<br /><br />But, after watching the movie and understanding how immensely disappointing and unsatisfying it was, I don't mind them not using classic songs like ""Duel of the fates"" or ""Battle of the Heroes"", because I would have felt like they were now polluted by Episode 9.<br /><br />So, after this being said, I do not consider this movie as part of canon, it's too bad. If you love Star Wars and you actually enjoy The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, you might not want to watch this movie and leave the finale of the Skywalker saga to be left to your own devices and figment of your imagination, trust me, it will probably be better than anything you see in this disrespectful, offensive and straight up impassionate film.<br /><br />The next Star Wars movie must be directed by someone who understands what it is, who has the intelligence to execute something philosophical and intellectually challenging. The people in charge of this movie understimate the intelligence of movie goers.",0

3610,7.0,"There is going to be a fiercely fought debate over whether or not this film is good or bad, but The Rise of Skywalker is how The Skywalker Saga ends (officially); though fans don't have to accept that, because The Original Trilogy was already conclusive enough. This film, I think, is a 're-conclusion' of the saga. Did we really NEED this movie? No. We did not. Though The Force Awakens was a great re-introduction to the Star Wars universe, The Last Jedi tried too hard to disrupt the strands of the previous film, and The Rise of Skywalker wraps it all up by being a fan-service love-letter instead of being a closing chapter to a cinematic saga. I consider these movies to be 'extensions' of the Original Trilogy that can either be accepted or not accepted by the audience.",0

3617,7.0,"After the train wreck that was TLJ, JJ Abrams was left to pick up the pieces and plot threads / characters that Rian Johnson seemed to have no interest in developing. Could Abrams give this trilogy a satisfying conclusion in light of Johnson's seeming intent to disrespect and disregard all that had gone before with his film? Well, for the most part the answer (somewhat against the odds) is yes. Elements of TLJ that annoyed / enraged some long time Star Wars fans (myself included) are addressed / countered to give at least some context to some of the previous film's most baffling plot choices. How Mark Hamill must have loved delivering the line about a jedi 'respecting their weapon' in light of his (and many fans) disappointment at the treatment of Luke in the previous film! Sure, the plot seems somewhat cobbled together and re-treads familiar themes / plotlines from previous entries, but Abrams keeps the pace up to make this seem almost (?) irrelevant. As with The Force Awakens, this actually FEELS like a Star Wars movie. Some might call it 'fan service', but I prefer to look at it as understanding your audience and their expectations. So while the sequel trilogy never reached the heights of the original trilogy (how could it?) and at times during TLJ seemed to sink to the depths of the worst of the prequels, this final film is a solid enough entry to see the Skywalker Saga out, if not in style then at least in respectability.",0
3618,2.0,"Much like the finale of game of thrones, I am searching for one of Job from arrested developments ""forget me now."" This movie is the most Star Wars cliche disgusting portrayal of any sci fi universe. The only redemption to seeing this on opening night is that there is a new episode of the mandalorian tomorrow. During the show I felt as if I was watching a low budget Star Wars parody instead of the finale to a series.",0
3619,3.0,"To better express my thoughts about this film I have to talk about the two prior ones, and Rian Johnson. I think that Rian treated Star Wars like art, like real cinema, not caring about fan theories. I love The Last Jedi, and I think that Rian was the right person to direct The Rise of Skywalker, because the first film, The Force Awakens, was a 'presentation' of the new saga that could be followed by any kind of story and they chose Rian to do that with The Last Jedi, so Rian had to be the one to close the saga because with The Last Jedi he made this new saga, his saga.<br /><br />The Force Awakens is a fantastic film and I think that J.J. is a gifted director (not as much as Rian thou), but if The Force Awakens gives you an amazing experience when you watch it, The Last Jedi makes you think after you have watched it. With The Last Jedi Rian turned Star Wars in something else, a true great movie, giving characters depth, giving them real character-moments - watching the movie, particularly the first scene with Snoke and Kylo, I thought of Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones has some of the most raw, real and unpredictable characters and that is what Rian brought to Star Wars. It challenged the viewer rather than pleased him, it elevated Star Wars to new heights. Rian made a movie when a mature movie watcher can enjoy real characters not a movie when a little kid can be amazed by the fantastical looking creatures. It's really a shame that people in charge at Disney and Lucasfilm couldn't see that and gave us this stupid final film to end the saga. The Rise of Skywalker doesn't please the real fans of the Star Wars, but with its superficial, stupid jokes that have no place whatsoever in the moments that were put, pleases the Marvel fans that after the Endgame and the rest of the garbages Marvel brought after it, needed something spectacularly dull to enjoy.",1

The story starts with the heroes of the third trilogy especially Rey and how she practices and has some kind of problem with the balance of the force. And continues with the rising of an old villain of the series and the final battle between resistance and the emperor forces. The first half of the movie was quite boring for me and I had to stop four times to drink coffee and not to fall asleep. However, the second half was better and it gave the chance of seeing some of our favorite characters from the saga for the last time. Soundtracks and music are some of the best points of the movie which brings up the nostalgic sense of star wars. CG is really good too and I couldn't find any problems regarding that matter. The cast has grown more into the characters over the years and their performances have become almost perfect especially Oscar Isaac & Daisy Ridley.",0
3622,7.0,"Firstly does this episode or this trilogy live up to the original, no but was it really ever going to.

If you loved the dynamic between Ben Solo and Rey in the past two movies you'll love this one as it takes that further in ways that I thought were fitting for both characters.

In this third of the new trilogy i still have no bond with our new heroes and couldnt care if the lived or died aslong as the originals like chewie c3po r2 etc lived on as i feel a connection to them. Rey's story arc has been badly handled, 3 films to find out who she is when 1 shouldve been enough and then 1 training and 1 bad ass movie. Kylo Ren played well by Adam Driver yet made to look like a spoilt brat who lost then moped through life. Poe just a pilot, Finn is a shame in the first film it looked like he could become something by the end he is just 1 of many turned storm troopers. Films lately seem to be made with the logic of ""everybody likes nostalgia so we need a movie that must have these scenes, make the rest of the film fit, spend alot of time re telling the same thing"". The best film in recent Star Wars movies for me was Rouge One. I got to know all the characters really quickly they had one mission with the odds against them, we saw the force in its raw form and a sacrifice that left you slightly sad but mission complete. Why they couldnt do this with the Last 3 i dont know. Go see the film. My review is sketchy as.i got in at 4am from watching it.",0

One of my personal favourite things about this movie was the austral projection/telepathic communication between Kylo Ren and Rey, it was really well done and seeing how they affected the different environments was awesome and something I Personally haven't seen in any other movies.<br /><br />A personal thing I didn't like about the movie was General Hux and Kylo both dying but that's only because I love both of their characters.<br /><br />The soundtrack like always was really good and told you how you should feel and tells you about the characters on screen.

3646,2.0,"I always loved Star Wars for the music and beautifully crafted scenes and sets. Whether it be from 1977 to 2015 Star Wars was always a beautiful movie. I felt this movie lacked beauty which is so odd for a Disney movie as well, the costumes were all just repeats of what we had already seen and I felt all sets were recycled as well.<br /><br />I have just watched all 9 movies in a row and felt such lack lustre with this last one I had to pause and check reviews to see if it was just me. The story doesn't exist and we see no emotional connection with any character.<br /><br />I liked the idea that anyone can be a powerful Jedi with belief and hard work, regardless of being a slave or a scrapper. It was nice to see a main character for once not needing a massively complex back story and their future being defined by their parents. Finally pulling away from the mommy and daddy issues and being about the family and destiny you make for yourself.<br /><br />Nope, this movie back tracks all of that and everything that is special and powerful about Rey is because she was born with it. What kind of message is that for people?!?!?<br /><br />There is no hope for the galaxy now if Jedis are literally a dying breed. Good luck Rey, looks like you will be starting a nursery of jedis instead of a temple!!",1

There was just no way this film was ever going to live up to that hype. Not only that, I would say it fell alarmingly short. This wasn't a conclusion. The story arcs didn't reach some sort of epic climax. JJ Abrams seems like he had so many ideas and tried to throw every one of them into his screenplay. While many of the scenes could have been special if they had a proper amount of buildup and time devoted to them, most of the 'big' moments felt rushed and empty. The movie wasn't awful, it just wasn't special and it needed to be. The plot holes were more like gaping wounds. I was left scratching my head a number of times during and even after the movie ended.

It was a MESS, from start to finish, with lots of pathetics attempts to glue all together with ghost characters and revisiting previous movies.<br /><br />Even the fighting scenes and battles weren't good. It is just PATHETIC.<br /><br />I'm a person that always tries to find something good, but this movie and the new SW trilogy as a whole is just an insult to the previous movies.<br /><br />If you were hoping that in the last movie everything will somehow finally make sense, I have bad news for you!",0

3651,7.0,"THE DEAD SPEAK! What first began as a whisper of few has now become a deafening roar of many. Fueled by hatred. Corrupted by a hive-mind mentality. Fully withered and consumed by the dark side. I refer not to the glorious return of Ian McDiarmid's delightfully evil EMPEROR PALPATINE, nor the out-of-nowhere, massive fleet he commands and dubs the LAST ORDER. Not of SUPREME LEADER KYLO REN or his FIRST ORDER, who are so close to victory they can taste it in the opening of this movie. I unfortunately am referring to you and I, dear readers.<br /><br />We, the STAR WARS mega-fans of old. We who have spent the past few years enraged at what they have done to our beloved franchise. While it is a beautiful thing to be passionate about what you love, let us not forget the warning of our little green master - ""Anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering.""<br /><br />Remember, in Anakin's desperate mission to preserve what he loved most, he destroyed it and became a monster.<br /><br />In the weeks leading up to release, I realized that for every aging super-nerd naysayer, there is a youngling out there who is ecstatic to see newcomers such as John Boyega's FINN in these new-era adventures. While maybe not tailor-made to suit you, the force is as strong as ever with the STAR WARS franchise, and I personally find your lack of faith disturbing.<br /><br />Like many though, I too had a bad feeling about this. However, I am relieved to say, I loved this movie! This is not just a STAR WARS fix, you get an overdose here. From the moment the opening crawl concludes, it reels you in and proceeds to barrage your mind, eyes and ears in an attempt to end the saga with a bang.<br /><br />A beautiful score, as is the case with it's predecessors. Visually pleasing on an epic scale. The focus is pulled closer to our central characters, which gives more time for them to be fleshed out.<br /><br />As opposed to 2017's LAST JEDI, this time around the few new characters are handled with an effective less-is-more approach. There are cameos a-plenty, which are sure to tug on your heart-strings. New force powers are explored, serving to expand the mythos. Last but not least, the action knob is turned to 11 and broken off. Lightsaber battles, anyone? Some scenes have very obviously been inserted by J.J. Abrams as deliberate fan-service.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is quite a bit further than a kessel-run from being a perfect film. It is plagued by an abundance of plot-holes. New plot-holes are created as they try to patch old ones from previous installments. Lore is blatantly ignored and will leave hardcore fans scratching their heads. While the grand scale of the film delivers an epic finale, from the other side of the coin it can be considered downright ridiculous at times.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to temper your expectations, return to orbit, and remember that this is fiction made for the sole purpose of entertainment, this movie is a blast. As someone who spent the last two films less than interested in our new heroes and villains, I was left wanting more of them here. Adam Driver steals the show and delivers a very emotional performance. While some points must be force-pushed off the final score, for me it is still a 7/10<br /><br />May the force be with you!",1

Like Avenger's Endgame, it fills every moment with action, loving references to all the earlier films and neatly ties up lots of loose ends, leeving this genuine die hard fan totally satisfied. Sure, if you want to apply logic to the plot you can pull it apart in seconds, but Star Wars was never Shakespeare and was never a documentary series, so why start worrying about the ""how"" and the ""why"" now? Enjoy it for the fun, the spectacle and seeing old friends. There are some very strong performances especially from most of the leading characters. I have two criticisms: there are a few cheesy moments, especially noticeable in the big crowd scenes (if you want to see how to direct big crowd scenes, watch early Frank Capra films). Also, the character of Poe Dameron, is naff and underwritten, and not particularly well acted; it is trying to replace Han Solo's character but without any of the wit and charisma. But these criticisms never spoil the film which, like episodes IV and V I will happily watch again and again.",1
3660,9.0,I definitely recommending that any Star Wars fan see this movie. J.J. does the best job one can do when ending a saga as legendary as Star Wars. Kylo Ren redeeming himself and turning to the light side of the force gives the perfect end to his character arch. 9/10 only because I thought that the first act of the movie was a bit slow and could have been more interesting and crowd enticing.,1

3673,3.0,"As a long term Star Wars Fan I just finished watching The Rise Of Skywalker. It's the 18th of December 2019 and without wanting to spoil anyone this movie has a massive lack of story telling. After watching this movie, I personally feel absolutely sorry for JJ, because you can either blame it on him or on Disney, as soon as you watch this movie you will understand. I am feeling totally empty. This movie felt like a rush through all of the films we have been before as fans. Remembering the Force Awakens which still reminds me of the best movie of the new franchise, the theaters were filled with amusing jokes and the gold old Star Wars movies. TROS totally miss failed its name. It was really unworthy. And *SPOILER* how the *** is Rey a daughter of Palps. I mean seriously?!? We had episode 8 which can be totally reviewed as a lack of story telling by bow. Snoke's character got revealed as a clone of Palps explained due to a freakin Bacta Tank shown with multiple heads of Snoke. Personally, i felt like WT every single 10 minutes in this movie. It felt like a rush through, because the plot needed to be told and answer all of the fan's questions. The movie definitely had its good moments, but as a fan I really felt left empty after this one. The major figure Kylo basically got killed by reanimating Rey after Rey saved his life earlier. Like come on. At least show us some force ghost, but obviously there was not enough budget for showing us the old characters. The story of the Skywalker's lightsaber rather seemed improvised to fill the plot than anything else. All in all it is just a major disappointment... This saga should have been stopped with Revenge of the Sith. Finally, this three movies especially the last one have been a disgrace for this franchise.<br /><br />This movie is fife times worst than TLJ and compared to this movie TLJ is considerably a ""masterpiece"". More and more as I am writing this, I feel sorry for the people like JJ and the script supervisors, because they probably did not even stand a chance against the power of the Disney ""Order"".<br /><br />I see why people may like this movie, but all in all it felt like a rushed through, empty ending with a huge lack of character development.<br /><br />As a fan I feel sorry. I really had my hopes high up, but I see that this trilogy was not thought through at all.<br /><br />I hope Fans won't lose their hope and maybe the ither movies will do better, but the past 4 years have been disappointing besides The Mandalorian.",0
3674,2.0,"This is bad, terrible, horrible, stupid, *insert negative adjective*. How stupid they think average viewer is? I expected more.",0
3675,6.0,"After the previous episode... I don't think anyone expected anything good from this one. Well, maybe except J.J. Abrams' fans. If those even exist on our poor, poor planet (never met any). Anyway, my expectations this time were pretty low. So, I can't say I was disappointed. Quite the opposite, actually, I was a little surprised. Only a little, though. Because this movie? It's a mess. Not because its intentions were bad, though. Quite the opposite. It tries to tell us way too much. The Force Awakens was like a long intro. The Last Jedi was more like a bunch of stupid jokes. Not much really happened in both of them and both movies just kept adding questions without giving us any real answers. The Rise of Skywalker? It tries to give us most of the answers at the same exact time. I'm saying ""most of"" because, well... we still don't have a freakin' clue about who the Knights of Ren are, for example, and what were their intents to begin with. Aside from the fact that the guys are, well, kind of evil. One way, or another, there's way too much answers in this movie. And the biggest problem with that is that the narrative thread suffers a lot. Like... A LOT. Even though this movie is longer than two hours, it feels extremely rushed. There's just no time to let us actually FEEL things. And a really bad directing that ruined pretty much every single dramatic moment (J.J. Abrams' fans, are you there?) doesn't help with that either. Like I've said, this movie is a mess with too many different things happening too fast. It's even hard for this movie to keep a certain kind of the atmosphere because of that. Just because it's trying to do all the job for both previous flicks that just wasted our time.",0
3676,3.0,I have been waiting for a sequel since Revenge of the Sith but this???? What kind of imagination does have those who are behind of this sequel? In order to keep the society on their side they tried to create new gen characters but where did this lead the entire saga to? If anyone would ask me my opinion I would immediately tell them that these movies should be dismissed from the saga and new movies should be made. Certainly Disney go and make something to replace these movies...,0

3680,1.0,This movie is so bad that it baffles me how they decided they should screen it. There is not a single redeemable quality about it. And Ian McDiarmid was so utterly wasted that it is an insult to his previous work as Palpatine.,0

3682,7.0,"The first act was a distressingly convoluted, high-speed multi-vehicle car-wreck. I honestly thought I might have to exit the cinema as I couldn't follow what was going on, and it was all happening so quickly that it bordered on an unbearable assault of the cerebral cortex. (I think JJ was busy trying to grab all the threads left flying in the wind by the previous 2 films, and weave something meaningful out of them. He didn't manage to knit together anything more than a face-full of sticky and annoying spiders' webs). Then things got better. Slowly. The second act calmed the pace down, developed something resembling a coherent plot, and was predominantly marred by poorly written dialogue and slabs of wooden acting. Oh, and some cheap narrative slight of hands that serve to distance the audience from the story through short-changing them on authenticity.",0

Sure it's still kind of a mess and the movie felt rushed, but given the circonstances it was pretty damn good. I just wish he could've directed the whole series, it wouldn't have been perfect, but it would've been more solid. It won't satisfy everyone, but nothing would've at this point.",0

3688,3.0,"Giving this last movie hope, and watched it. First part had made me curious how it's going to end and at some point i was already having this gut feeling going thru the half of the movie on how it is going to be.",0
3689,,"To discuss this third film in the sequel trilogy one must go back to the last film (The Last Jedi) which was made by someone with disdain for Star Wars and it's fans. He created a 'film' that shat all over the set up of the first part of the trilogy and also did not advance the story or characters with any conceivable direction, essentially killing any momentum and depriving the trilogy of a second act.<br /><br />So JJ Abrams had quite the task to undertake with not only this being the final film in the trilogy but the final film in the 'skywalker saga' and had no second act to build from.<br /><br />Essentially what they have had to do is make two films worth of plot and cram it into one film which makes this an overly fast paced, choppy story that dies not have any quieter moments to balance it out. That said Abrams did what he could and I can happily report that he reversed every decision made in the last Jedi to one extent or another. It is obvious that Abrams hates that film and has gone out of his way to expunge it from having to be viewed at all. Now you can easily skip episode 8 and still get the whole story.<br /><br />Despite it's many problems this film is visually stunning and returns to the characters having charming (although rushed) adventures. Also the one is back to natural junior rather than the bad Saturday Night Live parody type tone the last Jedi took and the film feels like Star Wars again.<br /><br />There was much more Leia than I expected and it was handled very well with Carrie Fishers send off being very respectful. I did not love the ending but none of it was insulting and in the end taken in context of where the franchise had been left this was probably as good as we could hope for and I am somewhat satisfied.",1

The result... a total disaster.<br /><br />Like Yoda in second trilogy, All fans were waiting a battle from the wise and powerful Luke, and we only received a videoconference Battle at the end of episode VIII. I also can not understand why they make a revival of Palpatine, for god sake, can not use imagination and create a new sith? and Palpatine has a grandaughter? O come on! stop doing a mess of this.<br /><br />All the trilogy was the new Jedi looking for something and Ben Solo running after Rey. I don't know if it was a new star wars film, or a Remake of ""catch me if you can"" from Tom hanks and Di caprio.<br /><br />It could be better idea to give Finn a purple Sword and said that is Windu's Son.<br /><br />And the people who created this ""trilogy"", receive lots of money...",0

3698,1.0,Dissapointing to say the least. Just a cash grab. The visuals are good and thats about it. They ruined a franchise by not taking into how the characters from the previous trilogy would act. Feels essentially like a bad Marvel movie. There was almost no character development across all three films as well.<br /><br />Truly dissapointing.,0
3699,6.0,"The Rise of Skywalker was in my opinion a disappointing ending for the saga. To start of with the good, the acting was great and some of the visuals were stunning. I enjoyed the Lightsaber duels and this film is very well paced I thought. It never got slow it just kept moving. The final battle with the starships was pretty epic too. Unfortunately there was a lot that brought this film down for me. To start, the reveal that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter was kind of weird. I could see what they were going for but it felt a little confusing when I thought about it more. Also I don't remember them explaining how Palpatine survived from the Return of the Jedi and that fact that he did kind of makes what Darth Vader did feel less meaningful. Luke was barely in it which I was not happy about. Some stuff they did with Kylo Ren I liked but when he turned to the light side and came to help Rey, that felt like it could have been handled much better and it fell flat for me. Finally the actual ""Rise if Skywalker"" was very disappointing. It was just Rey calling herself a Skywalker now and I think all the actual bloodline Skywalker' are dead. So overall I wouldn't say it quite the worst Star Wars but it was the most disappointing. For me it doesn't quite get a 6/10 (I just rounded that score) because of the major issues I have even though it has a fair bit to keep you entertained.",0

The force awakens was brilliant, the 2nd installment was so bad I cant even remember the name of it. (Luke milking something for Gods sake). But this last installment...words fail me. The script at the beginning was like it had been wrote by a child. The dark gloomy ness for Kylo Ren meeting Palpatine. Meh. Rens face being made by planet of the apes and that boardroom meeting of ""oh I like the helmet"". Oh come on we deserve better.

This film did not deliver what I had anticipated, which was an emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. The final battle between the First Order and the Republican resistance reaches its conclusion, fueled by a resurrected Darth Sidious (Palpatine). Rey finally realizes her powers and her lineage to her horror, that she is the granddaughter of Palpatine! The final battle scenes are tremendously well done as well as the fight scenes between Rey and Supreme Leader Kyle Ren.

In doing so, Abrams forces the film to rush through much of its runtime and story, simply due to the bloat. If you are on board for the story and in-universe changes then the last third of the film still has something to offer. A few spectacular moments and nostalgia hits make the climax an enjoyable sendoff for the saga, but the pacing and patchwork nature of much of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",0
3711,3.0,"Frankly underwhelming, the ninth and final installment of the Star Wars franchise failed to live up to the greatness and potential of the Star Wars dynasty. The deaths of important characters often went unanswered and were rather random. The outcome of the protagonists efforts was completely Disneyiffied. The amount of plot holes within the movie was disappointingly large, leaving the viewer with multiple unanswered questions that made the movie difficult to follow. However, the special effects must be given the proper praise that is due to them as the visuals of this movie, as is always the case in the Star Wars franchise, were unbelievable and gave a touch if realism. Although, the incredible special effects, however exquisite, could not overcome the overall jumping of the intergalactic shark that the 'Rise of Skywalker' was.",0

I feel it was an impossible task to conclude this saga with a decent film in the time the director had.

3720,8.0,"I am not a huge Star Wars fan but do enjoy the Franchise. For me the first three movies are huge nostalgia trips and remind me of my childhood. They, I am positive, have been a huge influence on me and my ongoing passion for fantasy, science fiction and adventure. The second trilogy was fine, nothing to shout home about, with some decent memorable moments. This latest trilogy has been the same. It's introduced us to some great characters, re introduced us to some old friends and has been enjoyable. I do feel at times that the latest trilogy was trying a bit to hard at times. Trying to be too cool, too fun and too stylish and moody in periods. ROS was actually pretty good. Kylo Ren is the standout character for me. Steals the screen every time he appears. I find the new breed of hero a bit too young and not very interesting to be honest. Maybe that's a reflection on me getting older though and not them. For me the best bits actually involved the Droids and Chewbacca and again is maybe a bit of nostalgia kicking in. The ending appeared quite abrupt to me with not much closure or follow on for our heroes. It became very much all about Rey who I found the least interesting. I also really did not like her final scene and words which made no sense to me and left me rolling my eyes. The Finn character and his love angle also just seemed to fizzle out and be forgotten about during the final quarter of the movie. Anyway a decent movie, great action scenes and great special effects. A few gripes but a worthy entry into the Franchise.",1

If jedi can do that many things would change during all this time and many people wont die...<br /><br />Last but not least in all the starwars world only jedis could come back from death as a ghost or hologram just to say only a word or just a sound ( believe the force ) but now they just come back and talk and laugh and negotiate and effect in things and consult people ??? So what is dying?????<br /><br />You ruined a great story<br /><br />Thank you,1
3725,9.0,"I am a huge star wars fan and I watched it for what it is and enjoyed it thoroughly. It has the best sfx, battles scenes and light saber duels by far. It has been directed superbly. If you do not want to jump out your seat at the end with excitement there is something wrong with the way you perceive things thank you for a lovable exciting end to the saga",1
3726,8.0,"I liked it. Not as much as A New Hope or Empire - but better than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. Undeniably great special effects, a likable cast and some interesting twists you probably won't see coming.",1
3727,4.0,"I'm a big fan and I'm aware star wars is for kids (mostly) and it's just a fairytale after all, but this is just insane... Plot-holes so big you could fly a star destroyer into them, Jedi powers so amazing that I feel sorry for Yoda and the likes, characters development sucks more than ever in this final chapter.",0
3728,3.0,"As another supposed installment, it barely serves its purpose. It would be ridiculous to deem this one of the greatest in the franchise, much less a good film. The hyperactive pacing does no justice for its cookie-cutter characters lacking substantial development. In all honesty, George Lucas' questionable writing never incited this amount of frustration. This corporate mess of a Disney flick is the embodiment of a deus ex machina. Viewing Episode IX, I didn't feel immersed and instead became distracted by how unbelievably preposterous it was, desperate to grasp my attention with flashy visuals and overdone fan service. If I were to cherry pick the decent elements beneath this film's seemingly-acquisitive inconsistency, the droids were the life of my party.",0
3729,8.0,"UPDATED 21 Dec 2019: After watching this movie a second time on this Saturday weekend morning, I would say I love it even more and I have to admit that it was well balanced from start to end as I paid more attention to the dialog the second time round. This is truly a Star Wars movie and I like the story told. The best of the latest trilogy.",1
3730,10.0,Everyone whined saying Lucas ruined his saga with the prequels. Now everyone says Disney ruined the sequel trilogy. There's no making the fans happy. This movie is fantastic and was a lot of fun!,1
3731,2.0,His own mess?,0
3732,1.0,I thought that the Phantom Menace was bad but it appears to me that All the new episodes are way worse. They remind me all the modern remakes of older movies when they try to add high tech stuff into it when it's not really needed as long as rest of the movie is good.,0
3733,7.0,"I'm a fan. I have been listening to the Youtube channels for months, watching every spoiler video I can get my hands on, even reading comments and watching the old SW movies (minus The Phantom Menace, that movie just sucks) to make sure I was up to date. I wore my shirt to the movie and I walked out glad that I did. The movie isn't nearly as bad as some people are saying it is. Are there plot holes and things that you wont like? Sure!!! But it definitely isn't the worst movie that you will see (as someone has commented). Now is it the worse SW film? I don't care what anyone says TPM will forever hold that spot in the franchise for me. Is it the best in the franchise? No. Yet Adam Driver as Kilo Ren satisfied me as a fan. He played his part very well and in an alternative ending, I would have loved to see him beat and turn Rey so they could rule the galaxy forever. But this is Disney and the good always wins. What did I not like the most? Finn. He just ran around trying to be Rey's protector/keeper, but it was evident from TFA that Rey can take care of herself. His was a stupid role to me. Plus what is he going to do? He has his own woman problems. He has a girlfriend, but is bonding with another child forced ex Storm Trooper? Yeah, his ever after isn't going to be too happy.",0
3734,10.0,A very enjoyable film to watch and amazing acting cast with one of best film making makers ever and cant wait to see what they come up next with.,1

3738,10.0,"Was the movie 100% perfect. No. There were a few details that were left unanswered. But those issues aside, the film is great! In my personal opinion, it was a well made conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Certain reveals such as Rey's family origin were executed perfectly. I didn't leave the theater disappointed. If you are planning on seeing it, watch it for yourself before you read all of the reviews.",1
3739,10.0,"Wow, just saw the first showing tonight and from the start till the Lucasfilm logo at the end, I was enthralled by what I was seeing. This felt like Star Wars again. There was, lots of excitement, the story was great, it moved at a good pace, and most importantly, there was great chemistry and banter between the characters that was missing in TLJ. The little zingers are some of the best parts of Star Wars, to me at least, and this one does not disappoint in that regard. I don't want to go too far in depth for those who haven't seen it, but this is a lot of fun and I'm glad it went out like this. If you have access to 3D, I'd say give that a whirl because it looked really good in the Cineramadome at the Arclight in Hollywood in 3D.",1

3742,9.0,"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a child. Seeing the series come to a close in this movie felt satisfying. I acknowledge that the movie lacked a bit of depth but that did not cut away from my enjoyment. All those who are talking about how badly it was written and how terrible the vision of the writers for the sequels were, I would like you to think back to the early 2000s. A time when this community felt the need to bully a kid into a mental breakdown because they didn't like the way he was acting. The new movies are a series of their own. Much like the originals and prequels. They are enjoyable and fun to watch even if its cheesy. I think you all forgot that these movies are space operas. ""But that didn't make that much sense!!! 1!1!"" Amazing observation. Please rethink your values ""Star Wars fans"".",0
3743,9.0,"Rise of Skywalker is an incredible ride from start to finish. It ties up the loose ends and plots holes from the previous two films. It actually elevated The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi. My only conclusion is that these negative reviews are from:<br /><br />a) Paid shills from rival movie studios trying to damage Disney's box office.<br /><br />b) Jaded Star Wars ""fans"" who automatically hate everything made after 1983.<br /><br />c) Jealous Star Trek or Harry Potter fans.",0
3744,8.0,"If The Force Awakens was wandering in the dark, and The Last Jedi was falling down a pointless hole, somehow the writers of this movie pulled the rabbit out of the hat in the end and wrote themselves out of the situation Lucasfilm had gotten themselves into at this point. That creative feat alone is part of the amazement of this movie. It has more heart than the last two combined. Daisy Ridley shows that she was the right person for the role and is the centerpiece to making the movie work, and she pulls it of better than you ever could have guessed, especially from the undeveloped ""Mary Sue"" affliction she had in the last movie.",0
3745,7.0,"This movie is not great but not terrible, it has plenty of easter eggs for more hardcore fans and enjoyable for someone who has only seen the movies once. People giving this movie 1/10 have no idea what they are talking about, 1/10 means that there is not 1 positive in this movie and that is just bull.",0

3747,8.0,"I read the spoilers, I read the leaks. But I chose to do one thing, and go and see the movie on opening night with an open mind. This is the best way you can go into watching this movie. Is it a great Star Wars movie? No... But it's nowhere near as bad as you're making it out to be. Sure there are some parts that make you scratch your head, but there are some scenes that absolutely made me cheer. JJ Abrams got my respect when he suddenly make things right for a wrong regarding Chewbacca in the very first New Hope movie. And I must say, the ending was absolutely perfect! This movie actually made me enjoy Jedi, a movie that I could not stand. I'll definitely watch this movie again because I think I would enjoy it more the second time. In the end, I would rather had a mediocre Star Wars movie, then no Star Wars movie at all!",1
3748,10.0,"I am definitely not a Star wars fan boy. I remember seeing the original trilogy probably when I was in second grade in the mid-90s and I fell in love with it. I was Luke Skywalker for Halloween and the next year I saw the re-release with CGI and all that good stuff in theaters. But by the time the prequels came out I was no longer interested. I did not watch the prequels until the last two days. I saw the part where Anakin becomes Darth Vader because I wanted to see that but that's about it. And I enjoyed the prequels although I can see why there is so much hate. But moving on to the newest 3 movies and of course rise of Skywalker.I was really excited to see Force awakens even though I wasn't a huge Star wars fan anymore and I loved it. Then I saw last Jedi and I thought it was really really good and I could not understand the hate. maybe it's because I'm not a fanboy maybe it's because I don't care about the cannon and all that stuff. But I saw some early reviews for this and I read a lot of really good things and then the next day or two the movie still hadn't come out to everyone yet and I was seeing all this bad press. And I looked on here and it was already like a 6.4 and I know for a fact that most of the people voting did not see it.I decided to watch it for free on my firestick and if I enjoyed it then I would go see it again in the theaters. I really really liked it. It's not as good as the first trilogy of course but I thought it was a very fitting conclusion. I thought they wrapped up a lot of stuff very nice and for the first time in the Star wars franchise, these movies are actually giving us good CGI. I'm not a huge fan of overly done CGI but these three movies had some amazing CGI. I just don't understand the heat. No one will convince me that this was not a good movie. Is it an Oscar winner? No but I'm definitely going to pay to see it this weekend. I watched the prequels and rogue one and now I've watchedStar wars emperor and Jedi and now I'm on Force awakens. Tomorrow I will finish Force awakens and last Jedi and finish with rise of Skywalker in the theatres. I would give it an 8/10. I put 10 because I think it's pathetic that people vote 1 because they are cry babies. This not a one. Sharknado is a one. Jaws the revenge is a 2-3. Even if you hate this movie it's no lower than a 5. Ve realistic. Stop caring about reviews. Just go watch it. Have fun. Stop overthinking. It's A MOVIE. A fun movie. You'll never be happy no matter what they do. Star wars is the absolute worst fan base. Jurassic Park isn't much better. Jurassic world and fallen kingdom are fun movies and people whine and cry about those too. yet you'll shell out money over and over. You people will never be happy qne then you try to sabotage it just cuz you're babies. It's fun. It's good. It's worth seeing. Enjoy.",1
3749,10.0,"I personally loved the film, although certain scenes were rushed, the story and visual effects were great.",1
3750,3.0,"I'm severely disappointed with the entire new trilogy. Imagine if there were no play on nostalgia within the plot line. No similarities, just something new. Then maybe... MAYBE this would have been good. But J.J can't pull that off. He and the rest of his script writers at Bad Robot are utterly worthless and I think this trilogy is a testament to that. I'm glad it's over and I'm hoping for a much brighter Star Wars future.",0

3753,10.0,"From the first moment to the last I was gripped!<br /><br />I was worried about this film, with so much hype and weight on its shoulders, but I loved every moment. Every twist and turn didn't feel rushed. It is on par with the original trilogy for me, and truly feels like it belongs as a 'Star Wars' film. I am left completely satisfied with most of the questions I had leading up to this film.<br /><br />It is clearly a labour of love from the cast and crew. Well done!",1
3754,9.0,"I was 8 years old when the original came out. I had all the toys, action figures, etc. Loved the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy not so much. Although I thought Force Awakens was not much more of a rehash of episode 4, I loved the return to the familiar feeling and heart of the originals. Although The Last Jedi I feel is the weakest of the new, it had it's moments. With Rise of Skywalker, I was really blown away by the completion of what is, for me, a story I've had as a part of my life for 42 years. It brought the heart of Star Wars full circle, with great action, story , and revelations, nostalgia and new beginnings. The best of the new trilogy, don't miss this one because of those that wanted something different. Thanks for the ride, Star Wars!",1
3755,1.0,Next time using comics. Terrible and Terrible saga. Best epic fail star wars film.,0
3756,8.0,"Well, the beginning has so many fast cuts i was exhausted after 40 minutes and I didn't buy those horses on the star destroyer either. But I do think the last parts aren't that worse than the others. I was touched so I am gentle with my rating like an old sweet-tempered man. The difference is, that I had no expectations for this movie and the episode before. So I am surprised it's not that bad. And all the reviews commenting ""The Force"" meant to be different: are you really serious? Jedi Masters go and watch those old Star Wars movies again there The Force used to be true :)",0
3757,1.0,They ride around on top of a star destroyer on horseback.,1
3758,10.0,Just so amazing. It made me laugh and cry so many times. Seriously the best time I've had at the cinema in years. I've been a Star Wars obsessed fan for 41 years and this didn't disappoint. One of the best Star Wars films to date.<br /><br />I can't wait to see it again on Tuesday!,1
3759,1.0,The whole trilogy is trash but this is another level of trash from acting to costumes CGI etc. Daisy Ridley is sorry but just not suited I can't buy into her acting it seems forced and just bad I know I'm watching someone try to play a part. Watched the movie as ofcourse and original fan but wow what a waste but good for Disney wallet no doubt,0
3760,8.0,"It makes me sad when people rail on the new Star Wars movies because of the parts they hate. All movies have parts that are less than perfect (sometimes really bad *cough* rose) but this movie had so much good in it. No one tends to talk about the scene with Kylo and Han, which is one of the most tender moments in all of Star Wars and is the turning point in the new trilogy. This movie had tons of good, despite the bad, and it's all about what you focus on. I loved the movie, and hope Disney continues to make more, because I love the universe.",1
3761,6.0,"Emotionally exhausting story line, too long and too Disney universe... good affects and fight scenes...",1
3762,1.0,Just didn't get it! Bad storyline and bad acting and very poorly put together.,0
3763,9.0,"Star Wars is a quintensencial movie saga, i really loved this movies, even the prequel trilogy that actually have some flaws, and the original trilogy is a master piece and then it came the sequel one and i really like this new trilogy a liked more than the prequel one, because it feels much more star wars to me. This movie is the full essence of star wars, an adventure a sci fi fantasy with family issues and space magic, and it was amazing! Of course there are some problems with some retcons made into this movie, but i think that its more a overall trilogy problem than a problem of this movie. This is the best moviw journey to rey, i really feel deep into her character in this one. To discover who she really is, and why she had a bound with kyloits amazing. The fight scenes and tje last war are grand spetacles! And the emperor is outstanding!!! This movie has some little tiny flaws to me but in the general its just a amazing end to one of the biggest and more important saga of all time! May the force be with us!! Satisfiying",1
3764,3.0,"I will start off first with saying, YES I do like The Last Jedi. I really enjoyed Rian Johnson's fresh take on the universe. The Force Awakens was an alright and fun movie. I forgave the plot point comparisons to A New Hope as it was a solid start to the series. TLJ was really fun and I liked where they took the characters. The casino part could have been trimmed up a bit and made it a better movie overall, but I truly enjoyed Johnson's mark he left on the series.",1
3765,6.0,"It is pretty evident from the beginning that there wasn't an overall plan for the trilogy before production began. There are certain plot points that come out of nowhere without any set up from previous movies. The main examples being the return of Palpatine and the retconing of Rey's parentage. Palpatine's return was so abrupt and it is clearly understood that it wasn't something they had planned before. Rey's parents being no one was an interesting plot point and it fit her arc well in the last jedi, but that aspect was altered in order to please the fans. There are also a few other examples which showcases the conflicting ideas of Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams. The constant mcguffin chases in the first act become a little tiring after a while. The part where they discover the assassins ship and the dagger felt like a very convenient coincidence and was just lazily written. Palpatine's plan is all over the place and doesn't make much sense.",0

3767,5.0,"Rushed. Bad writing. Predictable. Too many unanswered questions. Things just happened for no reason. It completely ignored the last jedi and alot of things happened that made absolutely no sense, a shame fo Star Wars to end in this way. Not a bad Star Wars movie as others might say, just a bad movie in general. Whilst it was entertaining at certain points, I just couldnt get into it because of the reasons listed above.",0
3768,1.0,"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. Plot was bad, everything about this move makes no sense and does not fit at all in the star wars universe.",0
3769,2.0,"I never watched the original Star Wars, so I don't have much attachment to this series. To me Star Wars started with Kylo Ren. A teenager who changes his mind all the time. He killed his families to get what has, seemed really badass, in the end changes his mind for no obvious reason.<br /><br />Maybe the bad guys' government should not let someone so childish to be the leader, they will have a better chance to rule. Rey kills him and saves him right after, so all the fight was just for their dating game.<br /><br />Other characters are super unnecessary and impossible to kill. They will survive everything, no bullets can ever reach them, however the only thing they do, was yelling, we will do it together, don't do it alone. I don't know why they exist in the movie. Especially Finn, he was just running around and yelling at Rey, even when she was having a super dangerous fight against Kylo Ren. If any of my friends kept yell at me when I am fighting, I'd kill them first to prevent distraction.",0
3770,2.0,"This review isn't written from a sequel hater. I enjoyed The Force Awakens a lot and even The Last Jedi. It actually makes me sad how much the series suffered from them playing a giant game of tug o war with it, especially knowing that The Last Jedi was also written as it was due to this.",1
3771,1.0,"You get the distinct feeling that the producers were thinking 'will this make money?' rather than 'will this make sense?'. The film is poorly edited; with a lackluster soundtrack; although in John Williams' defence the re-shoots and chaotic nature of this production probably left him little time to produce an inspired soundtrack. On a story level this film completely negates the events of episodes 1-6; especially Anakin's sacrifice and purpose as the chosen one. Hopefully this film marks an end to Kathleen Kennedy's reign over Lucasfilm; 'and not short enough, it was...'.",0
3772,7.0,You read that headline correctly. The fact that they learned from the last one and severely downplayed that horrible character's role in this movie is worthy of 7 stars. Over all the movie was very entertaining.,0
3773,1.0,"Awful, what a mess! This movie together with the other two sequels destroyed everything Lucas did with the first six movies. Went with no expectations but it still surprised me by how bad it was. A plot that has nowhere to go, horrible dialogue and character development, lack of originality, a chaos really. It's just fan service with stupid plot holes. Screw Disney, this is not Star Wars. Long live George Lucas and the first six episodes.",0
3774,9.0,"I really really loved this film, and as a film fanatic and avid movie buff I don't normally like classic super hero/hero's journey films, thinking they normally don't have a storyline or much meaning besides the obvious, but this film destroyed those preconceptions. I loved how it was paced, feeling like it's own movie and not an off cut of either the previous two films or the original saga, as well as what it did with the characters and story. The characters had a complete journey and development, abiding by the rules of the genre and this international story'a parameters yet still made it new and different to our assumptions. Although it was relatively predictable, as many of the negative reviews say, i think that is to be expected from a film which is ending not only a three movie story arch but also an over 4 decade long world and adventure. With this in mind, I think that the film was made beautifully, with special consideration of the cinematography and artistry of the cinema with the power and intensity of such a great story especially within its constraints of the 9 movie saga and internationally acclaimed story.",1
3775,9.0,"No spoilers, just my opinion that this is finally a modern star wars movie worthy of the name. Yes there are problems, but a far cry from the horrible Last Jedi.",0
3776,10.0,"Rise of Skywalker was a wonderful ending to this new trilogy. JJ had to contend with the death of Carrie Fisher and the events presented in Last Jedi. I think he handled it brilliantly. I was also happy Anthony Daniels (C3PO) was able to have a ""hero"" moment. Daniels is the only actor to have been in all nine movies. As a Star Wars fan I was very happy with this movie. The message, friends make a family not necessarily blood!!",1
3777,8.0,I like the Star Wars Movies. This Episode 9 is a good Star Wars Movie. Don't hear the haters here. This Movie has a good Star Wars feeling and many action + nice fight scenes. Daisy Ridley as Rey is great in this Movie and we have guest appearance in this Movie of Luke Skywalker + a comeback and big appearance of Imperator Palpatine. All in one a good Star Wars Movie you should watch in movie theater in cinema. A must watch movie.,1

3780,8.0,"Great fun, great special effects. Darker than expected. Ties everything together and has all the throw backs to the other 8 movies. J.J. abrams just made a Star Wars movie for the fans based on the backlash of the last Jedi and I think he made a very good job despite what other people think. Just go see it and take it for what it is. This movie was never going to please everyone. I've watched it twice now and got more from it the second time. I wasn't a fan of the last Jedi particularly so this movie worked for me. Loved it. 8/10",1
3781,7.0,Ignore the reviews and go see it yourself. I've been watching Star Wars my whole life and this was a great nod towards everything. I didn't know what was going to happen next. The ending was very satisfying. I probably cried a couple times. This is a great movie.,1
3782,4.0,"The overall feeling I got after leaving the cinema was a sense of emptiness, as if the movie had accomplished nothing. From the lack of character development, which could be simply passed as lazy exposition, to the 'return of the king' style ending sequence, that gave everyone a time to reflect on the trilogy as a whole and the movies impact on the star wars brand itself.<br /><br />The lack of change or growth to the characters in a manner that challenged the audience made the journey feel worthless, this is due to brisk pace of the film; where the original trilogy and at points of the prequels it would slow down and let us take in the events, this contrast with the rapid change in location (reminding me of Rogue one) and sudden introduction of characters. This film rushes out the scenes, as it was making up for the poor choice of events in 7 and especially 8, and due to the fact it practically forgot Episode 8 entirely (thankfully) it was acting as if it was 2 films at once. The disregard for the original trilogy was upsetting as by the (spoilers) scene where Luke lifted his X-wing from the ocean, removing character growth; this could have been improved by having Rey lift the X-wing from the ocean floor, as a callback to Luke's training with Yoda where he failed to lift it from the swamps of Dagobah.<br /><br />However there were some good parts of the film, the CGI for example was rather great, ignoring some uncanny effects it was decent. The increase of practical effects was a sight for sore eyes and the practical revival of Carry Fisher through old footage was amazing, I thank everyone who helped keep her legacy intact.<br /><br />As a whole it had a rushed pace and allot of polish, the effort that went into this film was evident and outstanding.",0
3783,8.0,"Loved the film just a pity so much of it was damage control.<br /><br />Our big reveal comes minutes into it which could've been done a lot better and takes a good chance for building tension straight away from us .<br /><br />There's some good solid action throughout visually amazing, loved the end and there's nothing wrong with nostalgia.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that we needed a lot more detail to explain what happened in between, how we got to a huge Armada ? How the emperor was revived ? Which should of all happened at the end to add weight to the plot instead of just accept it.<br /><br />I did honestly really enjoy this film and it did feel like a true ending.<br /><br />Maybe if we didn't have the last Jedi it wouldn't feel like 2 films squashed into 1 .<br /><br />Plus my son loved it and has a huge smile on his face the same as a generation 40 years ago did<br /><br />Isn't that the point ?<br /><br />Any reviews lower than 7 are completely undeserving.<br /><br />Game of thrones was destroyed at the end not Star Wars .",1
3784,9.0,"I despised the last films. There is one very nonsensical scene in this movie that threatened to ruin it like the others but it cannot stand up to this story. This movie feels like Star Wars. It feels like the gang is back together. The effects both practical and computer generated felt real. Beyond what any other movie had achieved. Everything felt real, and like actual human beings were behind it, unlike the last few disney dumpster fires. This movies story could have taken all three movies and have been a much better story. I hope this is the start of something good. Bless you JJ. That kiss scene was very very bad but still felt like the originals in a way, you know what Im sayin. True fans rejoice.",0
3785,10.0,"I am one of those fans that loved each installment of the Star Wars saga, especially the Anthologies. Granted, there were some better than others.

Every Star Wars fan should see this.",1
3786,8.0,I watched E9 as a closing act of a series of movies.<br /><br />So nostalgia is/was a must. So JJ used all cult figures&elements from older movies but he learned from his last mistakes at E7. That's way this movie isn't 1:1 copy of one of the old movies.<br /><br />It was fun to watch.,1
3787,1.0,"Tried watching this with my two kids today and could only stomach about 20 minutes of this, what the hell happened their no logic or substance to this movie and makes the Attack of the clones look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />I know the last movie left a lot plot lines up in the air, but really! Starting the plot of the third film in a Trilogy with a explanation of major events that happened offscreen is just lazy and an insult.<br /><br />Star Wars fans just need to face facts there hasn't been a decent Star Was movie since the Empire strikes back!",0

Now folks are ripping Rise for not developing the characters enough. Cripes. Star Rise is fun. Lots of it. Folks in my theater clapped and cheered and likely she'd a tear or two. I was one of them.

As for all the regular users I don't understand what they were expecting...if anything i have to thank all of you for lowering my expectations and actually enjoying the film. Ok, it's not the best movie ever, it's not even the best star wars movie ever made, but certainly it's not the worse, and most definitely not worth a 1 of 10 score. Come on, really? There are so much trolls outhere...",1
3791,5.0,"This movie began the way I was worried it would, with a plot that horribly transitions from the previous film and is full of cliche elements we've seen a million times before.

The last 3 are remakes of the first proper movies but with 'modern' CGI and so on. I like the main characters but the rehashing of the plots are boring, and this movie is just silly. I enjoyed it as a family fun movie, it it could have been any other current sci fi movie. The return of the emperor is so weak. I've seen the movie once and I honestly can't remember what happened.",0

3802,7.0,"I want to love it! I want to love every movie I go see but, that's unrealistic. I want it to be amazing; I wish for something breathe taking; I desire a show stopper. Sometimes, if not all the time, you cannot top the suspense and emotion of the original, '#TheRiseofSkywalker' is unable to even come close. 'Revenge of The Sith' is able to approximate so much more of the originals than what was delivered in this latest redetition. There is less suspense in this finale than in any of the other #StarWars trilogies. It lacks depth. The action is not all that dissimilar to a Michael Bay film; chocked full of explosions to distract the viewer from a weak story and sequel plot holes. Thank the good lord that I no longer have to hear Finn yell 'Rey' at the top of his lungs any longer. This movie doesn't even possess that top notch Lucas Films CGi. Needless to say, a fresh start will do the franchise well. Stop relying on nostalgia and write something creative. #GeorgeLucas is rolling over after this one. #starwars #movies #moviecritic how in the world, are you a Star Wars movie and you don't bring the pain in regards to a lightsaber battle. What world am I living in?",1
3803,6.0,"Had a few good moments, honestly felt the whole trilogy had more potential as a tragic romance with some adventure, than as a Star Wars adventure. Would've felt better about the ending if it had in some way implied (always loved the no sex/nudity, or profanity in the 5 episodes I've seen, no not a hard core fan) that Rey & Ben got a night together that resulted in a continuation of the Skywalker-Solo bloodline, not just the spirit of the line. I'd been expecting them to end up together, but Rey finally gets not Kylo Ren, but Ben & while him dying to save her is romantic, booo!!!!",0

Yes, most of it makes little to no sense, but it was a fun flick, which is what Star Wars is to me, a bit of fun and real world escapism. There's things I wish they did differently, but with a film of this magnitude and significance, you're going to get your cry boys who just don't like it (and those who just outright avoided it because of The Last Jedi)<br /><br />Some moments in this film are in my favourite Star Wars moments, other parts dont get such nice things said about them.<br /><br />I liked the return of some characters, as well as the inclusion of some new ones. Some things could have been explained a little better, but it's Sci-Fi and fantasy, we can just accept them.<br /><br />Ultimately, we could (and maybe should) have had something better, but it could have been worse right ??",1
3807,9.0,"This was an ending to a great STORY that's been going on for 42 years. It's closure for a lot of us not so new fans. We're ready to move on now. The first two films in this saga were a complete disaster. JJ salvaged what he could and with that comment, I'll also say that the movie flowed just fine. There's always going to be things you can question and analyze in these movies. That's how they have survived for as long as they have. That being said. At least some things were answered in this movie as opposed to the 2 prior films in which NOTHING WAS ANSWERED. You cannot string people along and give them nothing for 6 years. Most importantly. This movie felt like a Star Wars movie. Yes, that's a thing. It's a franchise. Sorry new fans. If you can't get over that fact, then you should put your stock elsewhere.",0

Let's find a map that Luke searched for ever in less that 24h... And unite all ships from all corners of the Galaxy in the same spot at the same time... Millenium Falcon speed and han solo piloting for everyone... Is this for real! Oh wait let's just transfer life energy from cup to cup like in Jumanji! Is there any possibility to remake just this one and create something really special!? Disappointing really disappointing!,0
3811,9.0,"Low reviews must be fans of the prequels. Keep in mind this movie is mopping up the mess of the last two terrible movies all while being great on its own.

3814,,"Like a lot of people I've been waiting my whole life to see the final Star Wars movie. Waiting to see what happens to Luke, Leia, Han and the rest of the epic original cast from my childhood. These final 3 movies introduce and center around new characters Rey, Kylo, Poe and Finn. I was excited to find out what happens to Rey and Kylo the most. When the two of them are on screen it is hard not to give my full attention. The same as Luke in the first movie Rey wants to know who she is and where she came from and Kylo knows things. Also, Emperor Palpatine is back and has his own plans for Rey which adds to the drama. The rest of the movie is mostly silly comedy that takes away from the main story.<br /><br />Spoilers: I felt it didn't deserve to be the final episode. Being called ""The Rise of Skywalker"" makes you think that Luke is the star of the movie. But he is barley in it. Rey is the star and she is NOT a Skywalker. Though at the end of the movie she takes the name for herself. Spoilers: I felt it didn't deserve to be the final episode.

I went in with the lowest possible expectations and that granted me quite a fulfilling time of entertainment and a few heart-warming moments.<br /><br />But then - I just can't stop thinking about what this could have been. It think to myself: Am I really the only person who does NOT want the producers and directors to break new records in how big and epic a battle is put on the screen?<br /><br />It seems, the producers have put everything they came up with in a big pot, stirred for a few weeks, then brought in a few script doctors who added twists ""no matter what"" and done is a unique movie.<br /><br />Well, it has uniqueness and it has moments. But most of them are hollow.<br /><br />I loved to see Palpatine. But why this slap in the face with this ridiculously large armada of Star Destroyers? Where do the millions of people staffing these ships come from, so suddenly? And then the rescuing fleet of good, brave citizens - come on - really, This was just kindergarten.<br /><br />It felt good to see old characters again, but it was so obvious they all showed up to conclude the tripled trilogy (was about to write crippled trilogy).<br /><br />One highlight of the film, btw, was General Pryde, finally a convincing character that was allowed to do at least one awesome, evil deed and not portraited as a complete moron.<br /><br />I left the cinema hardly excited and rather sad.

VIII, I really wanted to love what is supposed to be the final chapter in the saga; to be able to look back over the nine movies with a good feeling.<br /><br />But... I didn't.<br /><br />The action was cool, but there were no 'wow!' moments, and almost everything on screen had been there before.<br /><br />Then, during what was supposed to be a tense scene, with Rey climbing through the wreck of the first (?) Death Star, I found myself wishing that they would make an Assasin's Creed game in that wreck - which, I admit, is weird.<br /><br />Throughout the nonology, the Force is the equivalent of mana in rp games - it's something you can draw on. I'm okay with that. It works on a sci-fi level and most fans are cool with it. But when the Force starts acting alive, doing things to its own agenda, and getting all supernatural on people, it all falls flat. It would be like having a magic wand - which is purely a tool for creating and activating spells - which, of it's own volition, suddenly turn up at your work and tries and talk your boss into giving you a promotion. It would be cool, but neither your friends nor your boss would believe a word of it.<br /><br />We go to Star Wars as its friend. But even we can't believe this bull. There were almost as many ghosts turn up to clean house here as there were in the final battle of Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />It's just so, so sad. The writers wrote themselves into a corner and had to use magic, or 'because God decided to lend a hand' to get them out of it.",0

Abrams is back to direct this final chapter, after passing the torch to Rian Johnson in 2017, who divided the fandom with his 'The Last Jedi'. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic conclusion to the saga, which will please many fans and brings back familiar faces, to join forces in the battle against former Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who's back from the dead.",1
3833,7.0,"The final installment in the Skywalker saga is a movie that packs in everything and nothing at the same time. By that I mean it's everything a Star Wars fan wants, but it feels very rushed, convoluted and at times confusing. Ultimately the film is good and it's nice to see J.J. in the directors chair once again, however this trilogy should have been mapped out from the beginning. Say what you will about the prequels or the MCU films but they all had one creative force behind them and they knew what they were leading too! J.J. and Rian Johnson are both polar opposite filmmakers and they both delivered (in my opinion) great films but they were both set-up, and this was just a fast-tracked conclusion with lots of fan-service to make up for those who hate Rian's film, but I digress because there are some great things within this movie. Our main cast shines, the visuals are beautiful, and the conclusion is epic. Time will only tell where this film falls in Star Wars lore, but there is no doubt that J.J. loves this franchise and did his best to deliver a satisfying conclusion to this Beautiful and Powerful Saga, and while he does do that, it's hard not to see some of the flaws along the way.",1

How is Rey able to force hold a spacecraft with one hand and unfinished training when even Yoda and Anakin could not do such a feat? How does Palpatine have a granddaughter when he has never been linked to a woman? I understand that Palpatine wanted Rey and Ben's powers but couldn't he have baited them in the open space with his fleet of space ships fully functional? How does the resistance suddenly know how these destroyers operate when they have never seen them or do not have a single schematics? Why can't these work of art ships have their shields on while stationary?

But the movie sucked everywhere else. I still didn't care for rey, Leia, while it was nice to see her one last time, her death wasn't that impactful and was like a ""I figured she would the actress died"" feeling. I couldn't even finish the d*** movie once it released to disney plus it just sucked so much.

I could not have asked for a better ending, especially since what Johnson did to the franchise with Last Jedi. JJ Abrams corrects almost every mistake Johnson did: gives Snoke and Rey an origin story, brings light sabers back to be respected, restores Luke's optimism, and pays true homage to the original trilogy (no chance he could fix ""Mary Poppins"" Leia). Getting to end this epic saga on a high note was a tough endeavor, yet JJ does it as a master (the opposite to what he did with Lost). There is ton of action, tons of lightsaber fights duels, twists, misteries, despair, hope... and everything a Star Wars fan would want. Fan service? Of course!! But as a fan, that's what I look for! If I want my childhood to be destroyed, I can wath Last Jedi again, no thanks. During Episode IX I cried 4 or 5 times... there's a lot of emotion, and the ending is simply beautiful, heartbreaking yet heartwarming... GO see this film. You will enjoy it FOR SURE!!",1
3852,6.0,"I am a huge Star wars Fan, loving everything from movies, tv animated series so even being angry with this trilogy as a whole, can't be unfair and give a 1 score or take some of the merits of this movie.<br /><br />The movie has good special effects, thought they were not very impressive. It has two or three good cameos. But the problem with this movie is that the characters are really week from the beggining of the trilogy till the end.<br /><br />The Locations the heroes visit are very uninpired, being the Sith Planet of EXOGUL the worst. And the Space fights, and Lightsaber Duels were really lame.<br /><br />The Plot is simple in the oppening credits, everyone including heroes and baddies learn that the emperor is alive, and go and try to find him. Kylo meets the emperor on the planet Exegol, and the emperor asks him to kill rey. On the other end Rey's Gang go on a mission to find a device called the wayfinder, to discover the emperors planet location. Rey and Kylo Fights in some locations, and in the end they fight the emperor and Win...the end.<br /><br />From the very beggining of the movie it is revealed that emperor Palpatine was alive all this time, posing as Snoke. And snoke body is actrually clone controled by the emperor, and he poisoning Kylo Ren's mind the whole time. So Snokes Death in TLJ, was allowed by the emperor.<br /><br />So JJ Abrahms, manages to try to make some damage control of the plot holes in The Last Jedi. But was he succefull? Not for me.<br /><br />We see Leia training Rey, and a small Flashback of Leia training with luke, but does that explain Leia superpowers in TLJ? Not by a scratch.<br /><br />They give a small Holdo Manuever explanation, in the form of a small joke saying its a 1000 to 1 manuever. So what JJ does in this movie, is that he adresses TLJ plot holes with small explanations that are not satisfying.<br /><br />Is Luke Skywalker character saved in the movie? kind of... Luke even says that his actions were wrong in TLJ and that Rey should respect her lightsaber, punching himself in the face. But Mark Hammill has literally 5 lines of Dialogue in the movie, when in the TLJ he acted as Grumpy Old Bad all the movie it isn't enought for fans like me. I wanted to see a interection betwin Luke and the emperor.<br /><br />We learn later that Rey is Palpatines Grandaughter, in a reminescent way of Empire Strikes Back, she even thinks in jumping into oblivion like Luke did, but here the scene is a lot less impactfull.<br /><br />The Characters in this trilogy are really weak.<br /><br />Rey is overpowered, just because of her lineage, in this movie she has the force unleashed powers to take down ships with the force, and unwillingly makes a force lightning without even learning how to do it in the first place??? WTF, just because shes is Palpatines Grandaughter she can do a force lightning? Vader never did one. And the Daisy Ridley acting is really bad. Leia was a much better women character than Rey, she was brave, Rey is whinning all the time.<br /><br />Kylo Ren continues his redemption ark, but in the end he dies in a ridiculous way, giving his life for Rey, but doestn deserve to appear has a force ghost alongside Luke and Leia in Tatoine... Terrible writing. The only good scene was the one that Han Solo almost forgives Ben Solo for killing him, Ah ah ah. But believe me this Scene was the best scene in the movie, not kidding.<br /><br />Leia appears in a few scenes, and dies in a strange way, in a scene with little emotion, you just really fell for chewie. General Hux, is the most useless character in the whole franchise now, even worse tahn Phasma, he gets killed by a lame General Pryde that replaced him as the 2 in command. Tarkin was a great commander this guys are just weaklings not menacing at all. Poe Dameron, continues to be a Han Solo wannabe, and just annoys me. Finn gets less Goffy this time and i liked him much more this time, and i say this bacause he was the character with better backstory (Ex Stormtrooper ashamed of what he did and wanting revenge of First Order). But what was what he wanted to tell Rey, throughout the movie? That he was in love with her of course.So what about Rose Tico? And Jannah now? PLOT HOLE, in TLJ looked like rose and finn would have a romance, here looks like he loves Rey again as in the Force Awakens.<br /><br />Characters Crapped by JJ in this movie. Hux, has i already said. Max Kanata and Rose Tico now are just useless characters, that almost had no screentime and influence in the story. And JJ added another three useless characters for this movie Jannah, Zori Bliss and Beaumont. Why i ask? I would prefer more screentime for Lando Calrissian and the emperor and even Chewbacca.<br /><br />Another Ridiculous thing is the Knights of Ren? You see them in the Desert all Badass, but they dont engage in battle. And we expect a backstory to them, you get none. Then they reapper in the end to fight Kylo Ren, and th saber fight was even worse than the Snoke throne room in TLJ, with the Red Guardians.<br /><br />The plot quality during the movie is really weak, but the ending really killed it for me. Rey is the choosen one, and Anakin wasn't the balance of the force after all. He doesn't appear in this movie in any form, and he should in the end when Rey confronts the emperor with kylo ren. The Last 20 minutes of the movie are the worst part of the movie for me. The space battle is underwellming, Knights of Ren Duel with Kylo is a joke, Rey fight with the emperor is a small Force Lightining Scene, where she repels Palpatine Force Lightning to himself Desintigrating him in the process (Terrible CGI by the way). Rey dies from the backlash of the force lightining, Kylo Ren comes back from a pit, revives Rey kisses her and dies like Luke did in TLJ, giving is lifeforce to rey, he disapears and dies. Then a party in the galaxy, we see Cloud City, Ewoks, and a few other planets. Then after that we see Rey going to tatoine to lukes old house, calling herself Rey Skywalker (Ugh), and looking at leia ans luke force ghosts but not Ben Solo.<br /><br />Now my overall STAR WARS movies scores.<br /><br />Empire Strikes Back 9.5, Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One 9, A New Hope and a Return of the Jedi both 8.5, Attack of the Clonesand Solo 7.5, The Phantom Menace and The Force Awakens a 7, The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker a 6. So the three last trilogy movies are the worst of the whole franchise. If this trilogy was the first to appear in the theaters in the seventies, ir would't had the sucess it has now. But Disney, if you want to improve, sign Jon Favreau or Christopher Nolan to do the Knights of the Old Republic Trilogy, and if you folow the videogames source material, it will be the most Epic Star Wars trilogy of all time. Favreau is making a real good Star Wars story with the Mandalorian, and Nolan is the best director and script writer nowadays.<br /><br />I am Sad i wanted the Epic endingof the Skywalker Saga, instead we got a movie with uninteresting characters and uninspired plot. I know its not just JJ Abrahms fault, Because Rian Johnson did a terrible job, but the execution of this movie is really bad. Why dont you hear the fans? We had so great ideas for this movie. Another thing is the movie plot was leaked 3 months ago, and it was 100% right, don't you learn from your mistakes? The name of the movie should have been THE DOWNFALL OF SKYWALKER score 6",0

In all phases Palpatine was there to move the strings and hold the familys fate in his hands.

Ian Mcdiarmid is without doubt one of the best things that happened to Star wars. His acting made impressive something that without him could have been boring.,0

It was fast paced, exhilarating, emotional, had great action sequences, was funny when it needed to be, well acted and it looked superb on screen. It also paid service to the hard core fans with a few surprises. This film wasn't perfect and some criticisms could be made against it. This was a tough challenge for JJ Abrams as he had to work with the complete mess of the previous film and I believe he did a great job. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I do think that some people's expectations are so high that they will never be met.",1

3873,2.0,"To put it simply the Rise of Skywalker was bad and looking at the film I think this is true for one simple reason. Everything happens to the charters and the charters do nothing. Everything that happened to the happens out of luck and not there own wit. For example early in the movie Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C3PO get shot down by some storm troopers and the happen to fall into a pit that just happens to have the knife they need. If they had just had Rey scene it would have been fine but without anyone doing anything it just seems that the mean characters aren't getting what they deserve. Also the rescue mission to save Chewbacca was very stupid. Or in better words a lack of plan. It just doesn't make much scene for them to go there blindly and go shoot it up the place. However it could've made sense is if Rey simply knew they needed the knife before they got to the ship instead of figuring that out half way though the mission. Then it would've been completely logical for them to try to go to the base and get the knife and simultaneously save Chewbacca. This also could've eliminated a lot of screen time with C3PO getting repaired because it's not really essential to the plot. Then when they arrive at the ocean plant Rye easily fines the rock formation. If they just had them struggle more and figure it out after a bit it would have been fine. You could have just had Fin and the girl who's name I don't know have the same conversation about being storm troopers to eat up the time when they are trying to figure out where the object the need is located. Now the scene where Rye stabs kylo Ren is very well done not just because it's a good fight but the charters in the movie are actually making sone sort of choice in that moment. That being said the ending is silly. Fin just guess where they sent the single too? It just him being lucky again if he can use the force or not. And to defeat the Final order the main characters just send a message and that's it. It's not like they come up with a great plan they just get bailed out. And then many of the characters choices are mitigated. Like when it looks like Poe's girl friend died she's ok. When it looks like Finn had sacrificed him self he gets out of it. Even C3PO (granted not nearly as bad because this made some scene gets) gets his memory back. Which leaves us with only kylo Ren having to face his actions and dying. By making the main characters have little to no agency minimizes the ability that we are able to relate to the characters in thus making it harder to get invested into the movie. Same goes when there few actions don't have any consequences. It's hard to feel ingrained watching the movie.",0

But what I cannot accept is that J.J. has written this movie as if ""the Last Jedi"" does not exist, throwing any character development that Rian build up so well out of the window and that the actual last Skywalker is treated like absolute garbage for absolutely no reason at all other than J.J. seemingly thinking: ""that's how the Star War works, right?""<br /><br />This was supposed to be ending of the Skywalker saga and it's absolutely not satisfying and brings no closure.

We chose our own candy and made a ruckus in the theater. It was great. Something you won't see much of today. Kids left alone without chaperones. These days Parents put helmets and leashes on their brats just to cross the street. Kids who have their own cell phones and credit cards and are only allowed to eat gluten free. I can't express how culturally awesome it was back then. No fears of weirdos shooting up theaters or waiting to nab a kid and put them into the sex trade in another country. Star Wars represented for my generation a chance to explore our imaginations both in cinema and in our social choices. Star wars felt ""Grown Up"" and any one back then (my age) saying they were not frightened by darth vader, is straight-up lying to you. That dude was all kinds of freaky scary.

3918,8.0,"To me, Star Wars was always about fun, science fiction, and storytelling. It did not take itself too seriously with the story and logic, but it had great character development, cool settings, and each movie brought us things we never saw before. The was true especially for the original 3. In a New Hope, we saw a light saber for the first time and different looking robots, in Empire we saw Imperial Walkers and floating cloud cities, in Return of the Jedi, we saw force lightning, a party sand barge, and speeders zipping through the moon forest of Endor. The new and fun things is what Star Wars is and was. The prequels brought even more new things to us, but fell a bit flat with strained dialogue and the goofy Jar Jar Binks. But they also introduced us to great new characters like Palpatine, Count Dooku, and Qui Gon Jinn. They also expanded our appreciation for some original characters like Obi Wan and Yoda. And then the last 5 movies came out with Disney as the new owner. Even though there were glaring similarities between and A New Hope and Force Awakens, it was still a great movie, with interesting and exciting new characters. The Force Awakens got me excited about Star Wars again and made me want movies that expanded on Darth Vader and some other favorites. Rogue One was a great story and showed us that Star Wars is a huge galaxy and not just about 6 or 7 main characters. Then The Last Jedi came out and wrecked it all. I wrote a review on that mess of a movie so I'll save the space and simply state the fact that most everyone was disappointed by what Rian Johnson did. They were so disappointed that I think it turned the Han Solo movie into a failure compared to other Star Wars movies. I even think that Galaxy's Edge attendance suffered from the blowback of the Last Jedi. JJ Abrams was brought in to salvage this third trilogy and had a huge hole to crawl out of. Disney and the producers may publicly deny that this was NOT the case, but they all know that the Last Jedi did some major damage to the brand. The fans hated the Last Jedi.",1

Lots of questions answered and plot points wrapped up. But as with any film made by people, it still has its unresolved plot points and questions. After seeing it for the first time, it's a lot to take in.<br /><br />There's a lot to unravel and understand from this film, and I think it's one that will require many viewings in order to understand more fully. However, the overall direction was intriguing, thought provoking, and quite the journey to wrap up a 9 part film saga.<br /><br />Is it the best film in the saga? No. But it's certainly packed full of everything you love about Star Wars: action, saber battles, strong force connections, interesting characters, and of course, the Force.<br /><br />Instead of enjoying it, many will probably try to nitpick and complain about every detail that ""isn't the same as George Lucas's vision."" That's unfortunate as I've enjoyed pretty much everything Star Wars including this film. When it's all said and done, I've been taken to a galaxy far, far away on one of the greatest adventures in history. From Phantom Menace to Rise of Skywalker, through film and tv series, I've been transported to that galaxy and have enjoyed it. I hope other viewers can have that same experience. Sometimes we focus so much on critiquing things that we fail to let the film do what it was meant to do in the first place: entertain and transport us to that amazing place of adventure where anything is possible.",1
3921,5.0,It is better than the Last Jedi but it's a very childish movie. Ok I know that Star Wars was intended also for children but adults had also something to watch but this time it's not the case.<br /><br />I know that they had a mountain to climb with this movie but they didn't manage to do it.,1
3922,5.0,"Other reviewers are right: this is no classic Starwars we knew and love. I won't repeat the same language but it strongly reminds me of what happens at work: some dude produces a design document and send for stakeholder review. There are generally too many of them and they all put in their own selfish and parochial comments. The weak-minded author tries to close all the comments by catering to all of them, ending up with a meandering, soulless, and fragmented design.... In art as in engineering, you need a decisive and visionary leader to control the narrative. Inundated yourself in pipedream system engineering fantasy land and you get this design by committee.<br /><br />Visuals are good tho... Looks like after 2000 the only dudes who worked hard in the film industry were the visual effect crews.",1
3923,1.0,Disney ruined star wars worrying more about pleasing the left side of the idle than produce a movie with a good story line,0

3928,8.0,"This is a rating for the whole trilogy. Ok look, i was hoping that in the end rey would actually turn to the dark side i mean that would be some BADASS ending, apart from that all three films were entertaining to watch, emotional and all in all very enjoyable. Im a big star wars fan and honestly cant understand the stupidity from 'fans' people just love to moan and complain about every single thing these days. Grow up and enjoy things. Goodbye.",1
3929,8.0,"Star Wars Force Awakens was great. We loved the new characters and the nostalgia of the old ones. The. Last Jedi came and ruined everything to the point I swore I wouldn't even watch Star Wars movies anymore.<br /><br />Rise of Skywalker brought me back to the theater and had me leaving with the sensation that J.J. Abrams did the best he could to fix the screw up that Ryan Johnson created. Rey, Finn and Po are cool characters, but Kylo Ren & the Knights of Ren will always be a wastes potential.",1
3930,6.0,"The latest Star Wars movie, Rise of Skywalker, delivers a fairly decent movie. Unfortunately, it is not enough to completely rebound from The Last Jedi and save the franchise. The Rise of Skywalker was better, but not as much.",0

3933,1.0,A disjointed mess but nowhere near as bad as the first two films of the Disney trilogy.,0
3934,9.0,"All the 1 star haters you can't take serious. Because even if you don't like it, it's not 1 star. And there is a lot to like. They treat all the old stars right this time. Leia has a perfect ending, Lando is great (you have to remember that the actor is not in the best shape), Chewie is great as always and even Han and Luke have their ending. And for the new guys. By the end of the 3 movies you have the felling that they are really characters now. It's the best star wars movie since 83. Period",1
3935,10.0,"After the mess of the last couple of movies, they finally made a good one.",0
3936,10.0,The movie is just right. Character choices reflect character experiences in the story with old characters being paid proper respect and new characters evolving and what feels like a logical manner. All put together you end up with a product that is very satisfying and feels like an appropriate ending an epic story. Everything comes full circle just go watch enjoy with childlike eyes and enjoy what may be the final trip to a galaxy far far away.,1
3937,9.0,"The story line is fast, the scenes are amazing, there is action, tears shed, and a great story. Was enough material in there that could have been expanded into two more movies not just one. But those familiar with the saga can follow along just fine. Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. Go and see it!",1
3938,3.0,"If you have any sort of expectation towards this movie and you're contemplating going to see it in the cinema, all I want to say is: You really don't have to. This movie does nothing else than you yourself could not use your own imagination to think up in order to tie the new trilogy up in an ending. Nothing new or interesting is offered here that will have an impact on the Star Wars universe at large or you as the viewer, and all that is really proven is that ultimately, the story of the new trilogy was pointless.",0
3939,8.0,"If, like me, you went into this movie with an open mind, you were not disappointed. Is this the Star Wars most of us grew up with in true George Lucas fashion? No, it is not. It DOES outline the temptations of the Dark Side of the Force and show how good will truly prevail. There were a few surprises that were extremely pleasant that tied the old to the new, in all incarnations of the Star Wars cinematic universe. I cannot be displeased with this movie. Was it a ten? No. But it was extremely good, if you kept an open mind.",1

3946,6.0,"Too rushed. Many cut scenes. Not giving enough time to let good scenes and emotions set in. Plot from all 9 movies tied well together. Yes, it makes sense that Palpatine returns and is finally defeated. Some fans rating this 1/10 based on Palpatine's return obviously don't understand that he was behind the dark side for the entire series. He plotted to create the empire... Snoke was just of his tools. Rey and Ben finally bring balance, where Anakin failed to do so. With all ups and downs, it all makes sense now.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie could have been so much better if it hadn't been cut so much... Most cast except Rey didn't create the same magic as the original cast...<br /><br />Anxiously waiting for the director's cut...",0
3947,2.0,I can't believe how bad this was!!!,0
3948,10.0,Been a Star Wars fan for 40 years. Had high hopes for this movie because the Last Jedi was so disappointing. THANK YOU JJ FOR MAKING THE LAST EPISODE OF THE SERIES AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. I LOVED this movie. Don't believe the critics. They're idiots. This was fun and entertaining every second. ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!,1
3949,5.0,"Few lovely visual moments, bit of nostalgia, mostly gibberish.<br /><br />Can't be too hard on it, The Last Jedi left them with nowhere to go. Should have done a Bobby Ewing getting out of the shower dream sequence.",1

3952,6.0,"I'm not a huge fan like many, but I liked the franchise and most of us can agree that the latest films in the same narrative line have been terrible in terms of plot, organization, and some cases even acting. However, there was good stuff like some new character designs, ambiance designs, and structure designs. About the main actors, there was no progress.",0
3953,8.0,"Fast paced, lots of story, lots of laughs and great SFX.<br /><br />Film starts of with a great opener and doesn't let up all through the film. I got to the end of the film and honestly thought there was no point in having the last jedi film at all. There was a lot to the story and the film is really worth watching. This felt like a great star wars film.",1
3954,9.0,"I thought the movie was really good was it perfect like the originals no, but it definitely wasn't the worst. I have to say my whole theater thought so to everybody was clapping. So the people who rated it and said it was horrible were people just wanting to complain about the movie.",1
3955,5.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is a movie that suffers from its fast pacing, it introduces too many new ideas and hardly explains them. Many plot holes come up that are later explained out of the movie. Besides the pacing, this movie is a huge technical achievement, the settings, the acting, the effects and the music are all great. The Rise of Skywalker has a good story hidden behind a very rushed plot.",0
3956,10.0,"I read all the negative reviews, so I was expecting to be let down. But I really, really loved it. Ignore the impossible to please fans who were destined to hate this movie no matter what it was. This was an amazing movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
3957,10.0,Seen it three time so far and I just love it! The goosebumps where there from the first moments. Action packed and full of nostalgia.,1
3958,7.0,"After seeing the initial reviews,i thought i wouldn't like it but,it turns out, it was fine. It was flawed yet a kinda satisfying conclusion.",1
3959,6.0,"I think the original Star Wars movies were extremely overrated. The new movies shouldn't be hated so much. The bond between Rae and REN is interesting, although I think they should have made it more about them two and not The old emperor. The landscape in TROS is really cool. The sith world was an interesting plot. I like the mystery of Raes origin. The movie kept me interested the whole time. Of course there are some cringeworthy moments, it's a movie made for kids (teenagers). No matter how bad adults think it's for them it's not so of course the plot seems like it's written for 12 year olds. It is !!! Watch the movie and don't compare it to all the others and I bet you'll enjoy it.",0
3960,7.0,"When i saw the credits roll, i didnt know what to think. The movie is realy fast paced, especialy in the first hour. So i didnt have any chance to think about thr stuff that happened for too long. Now that i thought about it, i have to say i agree with most things that they did.",1
3961,10.0,"Absolutely loved this movie, I see no fault in the movie at all, how does anyone know what George Lucas vision was? no one can read minds, unless your psychic. but yeah I was on the edge of my seat. I am a huge star wars fan, every time I spot a t shirt i want it. each story is different, each movie never the same. how can anyone be a star wars fan if they don't go with it. it's not going to be a new hope, all 9 films are split in 3 movies each, they are all different, people need to stop finding flaws in the movie, and expect it to be the same as the other ones, who wants the same thing. that would be very boring. I think it was an triumphant send off for this 42 year long lasting bunch of movies, this one will be my ultimate favourite. it made total sense to me. sorry if everyone else doesn't get it. I am not going to pick this movie apart and destroy it, each one is unique and I love them all for being individual. goodbye to the skywalkers, you will be missed. but here is to a new generation. it's sad it's all over now. by far the best stat wars film I have seen yet hands down.",1
3962,10.0,"I am no fan at all, I thought I was because I saw all the movies at least once and some of them I repeated but it turns out I have no apparent knowledge to judge this movie for what it is because it does not compare to the old Star Wars trillogies.",0
3963,10.0,This was amazing... do not let these other negative reviews drive you away. The movie was phenomenal perfect ending... 10/10 way to go JJ Abrams....,1
3964,7.0,I was abit optimistic because of some of the reviews . However it was better than expected and worth a watch 7 from me,0
3965,1.0,What does the Writer wants to tell us with this film.....,0
3966,1.0,I Will keep It simple: Stop instrumentalizing peoples nostalgia.,1
3967,9.0,"---------SPOILER FREE-------<br /><br />I think the biggest reason for the controversial reviews is due in large part to the differing reactions to The Last Jedi. I tend to fall into the category of people that enjoyed The Last Jedi, but don't think that it contributed very well to the story. That being said, many critics loved The Last Jedi and that is why they did not like The Rise of Skywalker.",1
3968,5.0,"Worst Star Wars film of all time. Tarnishes the Skywalker name and Anakin Skywalkers arc with Rey who isn't fit to lace his boots. All the side characters are boring and serve no purpose to the story apart from making unfunny jokes and for political correctness. The revelation of Rey feels rushed and out of place falling flat and having no real impact on me as a fan. However the Biggest dissapointment is the return of Palpatine who is somehow alive with little explanation, then is defeated by little to no effort whatsoever despite having the power of all the Sith. Destroyed the franchise for a paycheck lost a fan today.",0
3969,9.0,"All good things come to an end. And so does the Skywalker Saga. This film is the best since Rogue One. A good story, some great and unexpected twists and all in all a proper goodbye. I really enjoyed it. I am sure critics will be alble to find all kinds of things wrong with the film, but as an entertainment piece it is surely one of the years best.",1
3970,10.0,"First things first, I want you to know that I'm a storyteller myself. Because of this, I'm overly critical when things aren't done right, and very vocal when they are.",1
3971,7.0,"I actually liked the Force Awakens and tolerated/kind of liked the Last Jedi. This one was fun to watch, but it is a one-time experience which pales in my memory even now. It just didn't have high enough stakes. Why is that? Because they reintroduced a villain out of nowhere which felt more like a joke than the actual threat. Hence, no suspense. Actually there was some suspense but nothing near the epicness the concluding installment should provide.",0
3972,10.0,Plot felt rushed at first.... but then turned into a masterful beautiful ending worthy of the skywalker saga.,0
3973,6.0,"Review: when filmmakers try so hard to top Episodes 4 and 5 instead of making a fun enjoyable movie, the end result is just something that falls apart. The movie doesn't match or even rhyme with the previous two of the sequel trilogy. And as a result, the movie viewer will be confused about so many plot elements of the movie. Many Star wars fans are gonna be upset by the creative and story decisions that JJ Abrams and Lucasfilm decided to take. However, the Movie ends on a poignant note, and there is this feeling of Closure to the Skywalker Story. That being said, this film was a mess.",0
3974,2.0,"I just don't. So i watched Star Wars. I am not a lifelong fan or whatever, but we decided to watch a movie for the Holidays. Well, this sucked.<br /><br />It was stupid.Not only the characters' motivation was jumbled and illogical the acting was terrible. Who are these actors and actresses??",0
3975,3.0,"Lots of bad here. Rushed... really rushed. Like so rushed, I could barely make sense of it and I am a 20 year fan. Introduction of new characters that don't have time to have a proper arc and backstory. Set pieces that don't seem to have any connection with one another.",0
3976,3.0,I just left the theater and without much effort I counted 10 plot holes. Also how many Macguffins do they need? I think there were at least 4. I might have missed one or two.,0
3977,1.0,"The fact that this got several nominations is unbelievable. If you're a true fan of Star wars, there is no way you can like this movie. They had everything- great cast, visuals, budget, universe and they MESSED up. The Rise of Skywalker actually shows the death of the few remaining Skywalkers. Star wars saga should've been called: ''The tragedy of the Skywalkers.'' All that family did was suffer as palpatine's playthings for decades and the last living member gave his life to save Palpatine's granddaughter.(who proceeds to steal even the Skywalker name). Seriously, if you loved the original trilogy, don't watch this. Ignore it. This trilogy destroys our heroes to show girl power. If they wanted to show a female Jedi, there was no need to destroy everyone else. Palpatine revives out of nowhere. As much as I loved that villain, this is just lazy writing. And of course, the standard cliche is present- ''villain gets redeemed only to die immediately afterwards''. Can we have a movie where the bad guy lives to pay for his crimes or is it just too much to ask? To top it all off, this movie is essentially a rip-off of other, better, Star wars movies and it SHOWS. Again, we have a couple tragically separated(like in Rogue one, Like Anakin and Padme and even Han and Leia). Disney went too far this time and this is not how the Skywalker saga should have ended. You killed Star Wars, so whatever comes in the future I will gladly miss. Time to move on. What a lousy way to end ''the story of a generation''.",0
3978,1.0,I am not one to trash a star wars flick for the heck of it. I have been a fan for all my life and will continue to be one even after watching this unfortunate ending. I am not going to spoil it for anyone either. My only question would be who the eff edited this movie? I am just saddened by the ending so very much that I am venting here.,0
3979,6.0,In this day and age a new Star Wars movie should be great. These movies have about the same depth as all the marvel movies.,1
3980,8.0,"Don't listen to the hate, If you don't like this movie you don't like Star Wars. It's a thoroughly enjoyable, fast paced movie, with amazing visuals and a solid story. Yes there are flaws, but there are also a few ""You're all clear kid"" moments that should thrill any Star Wars fan. The best of the Disney trillogy by far and actually makes The Force Awakens a bit more solid in the process... lets just forget about The Last Jedi!",1

3984,7.0,If you didn't like The Last Jedi then you'll probably like this movie. It's not a great movie but it scratches the itch. The music in it is far and away the best of the new trilogy. The dynamic between Kylo and Rey is what holds the new trilogy together because plots are convoluted and characters are weak. Space travel has completely changed since the original trilogy and there's too much going on to care deeply about any of it. But it's a fun ride and a decent conclusion.,0
3985,9.0,Ok it could've been because i was watching in 4DX but this was way better than TLJ and one of the most original SW storylines in recent years,0

3993,4.0,"Let's cut to the chase: The kids will love this SW movie and propel it to making another $1B for the house of mouse. They've yet to develop any critical understanding for elements of a good and bad movie, so they are forgiven for now until they grow up. For the rest of us with some sense of appreciation about plots, writing, and character arcs, SW TRoS fails to deliver a palatable ending to a beloved saga. Why bring back Palpatine? Why is Rey a Palpatine? What's the purpose of Finn wanting to tell Rey that he's Force-Sensitive? Why did Palpatine have all the resources to build another fleet of ships that could easily overwhelm the Resistance? Leia's Jedi training reveal was rushed - she's a legit Jedi? C'mon (wo)man! By holding up two light sabers, Rey suddenly has enormous electric power over Palpatine -- especially being the least trained and accomplished Jedi? So many burning questions leave the entire narrative very unbelievable.",0
3994,8.0,"I feel pleased and in high spirits after having seen the movie. It's not a great movie, for the moment I rate it a little lower than The Force Awakens but it is a solid 7/10. It's not going lower. By comparison, I felt absolutely nothing after Episode 8. During ""The Rise of Skywalker"" I had tears several points in the movie, especially at the end.

Perhaps this is the status of Star Wars in the eyes of the American emperor.",1
4001,7.0,"First of all, don't mind the reviews of people rating this flick with a 1/10. It's ok if you're disappointed, but a 1/10... you're just being a fangirl crybaby. Is this the best Star Wars movie? Hell no. Is it the best movie in this trilogy? No. Is it the worst? Of course not! It is way better than the prequel trilogy. Great special effects, fun new characters and familiar old ones, a few good jokes and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't read any of the leaks, so the plot was new to me. Some things were a bit far fetched and they took a couple of weird twists and turns, but man, I had fun and that's what star wars should be all about. So if you're not one of those sad, sad snowflake fanboys that want everything to be just like the original trilogy, just go watch it.",1
4002,2.0,"JJ did a great job with this movie. It's as delightfully campy as the original trilogy, and I adore that they finally touch on sith artifacts and culture. JJ brought a lot of the magic from the games and old movies into this film, and the lightsaber fights were splendid. If you have trouble following the plot... I'm sorry. It's pretty easy to follow, and it's decently straightforward. Some characters' motivations are unexplained or underexplained, but otherwise it is a great movie with tons of throwbacks to the eighties.<br /><br />However, this movie was not made for me. As someone who grew up on the original trilogy and prequel trilogy but now is a lot older and more mature than I was then, this movie was not made for me. The plot is back to being mostly male led, any major Asian characters from previous films are sidelined, and the world is relegated back to the oversimplified black-and-white morality of Lucas' six films. Every interesting and unique addition from TLJ is retconned in a way that makes it feel like infighting between episodes 7 and 8.<br /><br />The movie is genuinely good. It's enjoyable, and it works very well to close out the rest of the saga. Apart from a couple parts, the film directors and writers made good choices and a solid film. However, it's a movie by a specific demographic for that demographic, with some pandering here and there to make it feel ""woke"" without eating to actually be woke.",1

It's pretty thin on narrative and character development. The dreaded 'Last Jedi' definitely had much more ambition and stronger emotional arcs for our characters to undergo. 'The Rise of Skywalker' seems almost like an overcorrection in giving fans the fan service and easter eggs they want.,0

I see and understand the flaws, but I really believe that if TLJ would have just built off of what was set up in TFA, this movie could have been a much smoother conclusion to this saga.

How can they take the world's most entertaining and imaginative saga and turn it into the most hackneyed commercial offal ever?<br /><br />The Rise Of Skywalker is a middle finger to viewers. The exact opposite of the title happens in this film. Exact opposite.<br /><br />JJ Abrams, can you look at yourself in the mirror?",1
4018,10.0,"If you weren't in the Cinema in 77 you're never going to really understand what Star Wars meant to people like like me. Everything around at that time was grey... Grey and flat... Sure there was the odd gem; things like Jaws, close encounters etc.. but overall...Grey..",1
4019,1.0,"My words can't describe my feelings right now.It is just a realy really really bad movie.A bad movie for star-wars fandom,a bad movie for star-wars galaxy,a bad movie for all the people that had the opportunity to watch the original trio in the cinemas back in 1970s, a bad movie for all the previous actors who had taken part of in older movies,a bad movie for all the fans waiting for years to come,a bad movie for american history,a bad movie cinematography,a bad movie for hollywood,a bad movie for disney,a bad movie for us and a bad movie for new generations to come.",0
4020,9.0,Great ending to the sequel trilogy s well as the Skywalker saga that spanned nine movies. Very impressively handled and rounded up the missing pieces from previous films quite nicely.,1
4021,8.0,"Star wars fans suck so don't listen to them and make you down mind up. Yes there are moments that you can find fault with, just like every single star wars film, but there are so many Great moments that I don't care about looking past the faulty ones!<br /><br />If you expect star wars to follow a pattern because you think the original trilogy is the be all and end all of star wars you'll probably be disappointed, but that's your fault, not this films fault.",0
4022,6.0,Just can't get my head round a particular scene near the end that seemed to contradict itself at least twice.. Odd finish to this trilogy and clear attempts to be woke again.,0
4023,8.0,Return of the Jedi was the first Star Wars movie I saw in the theaters. I thought IX was very good especially if you are a kid and this is your first few Star Wars movie.,1
4024,8.0,"As many have pointed out, nothing will EVER compare to the original trilogy. Plus for many who watched them in their younger years, the impact made in watching those movies at younger age also has huge impact on the way you look upon them too. Regardless the original can never be compared to. The prequel trilogy had its approach to explain all that led to the movies so many loved, and they did a good job and they were well done. The only flaw in the prequel was Jar-Jar being used too much, but as much as that was a slight annoyance, it didn't ruin the overall experience and they were fun enjoyable trilogy.<br /><br />Here is the truth to it all, even though the recent trilogy obviously connects to the original trilogy with characters, the truth of the matter is, these are truly more of a new trilogy and new direction of telling of the story, so in a way all the original Luke Skywalker story line told in episode 4, 5 & 6 had a start & finish. So in episodes 7, 8 & 9, the story still has Luke within the story, however he isn't the main focus of this trilogy. Think back to the prequel trilogy, who was that entire trilogy about? It wasn't really about Anikan Skywalker, but it was more about Obi-wan Kenobi showing his journey through all 3 prequels as he was the focus and biggest character in all 3 of those movies. What happens when you go to episode 4, Obi-wan (old Ben), is a small part and it was all about Luke now. Well this new trilogy basically did the exact thing, Luke had been reduced to small character and now was about Rei and all the new characters. If you watch these 3 new movies as more of a new direction of stories and still including old characters to connect together, then you are able to enjoy these movies much better. This final episode 9: Rise of Skywalker closes off this trilogy with connection to the original trilogy with lots of nostalgic visuals, (or voices), and at the end you have a very exciting and enjoyable trilogy new series. Are there flaws, yes there are, but a big part is because of the constant comparison and/or expectations everyone has! Just enjoy these for what they are and understand nothing could EVER come close to getting the same feeling majority of people got when they saw the original Star Wars Trilogy and nothing will ever be able to match that! ""Luke, I am your father"" can never come close to matching the feelings you had at that moment if you watched it for the first time, so instead of trying to capture something that can NEVER be recaptured again, best to enjoy these new set for what they are.",1
4025,10.0,I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and this film is the perfect final chapter. The best and most intense of all the new Star Wars films. I will say this Rise Of Skywalker is on a par with The Empire Strikes Back,1
4026,10.0,"The originals started in 1977. It's been a while. Obviously things have changed. No this film is not the same as the originals, because it's NOT THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. But saying that's its not true to Star Wars, or that the film sucks. You're missing the point. Let's keep the love of the Star Wars universe alive for generations to come. The film has its issues obviously, but to say it's trash isn't helpful. You hate it? Fine. But let others have a chance at seeing it without without your destructive words giving them bias. We have to keep the Star Wars fan base alive!!!",1
4027,7.0,I swear people just be trolling these movies for the sake of it now? I seriously can't understand the hate on this movie! It was brilliant. Full of action and amazing new characters along with some old faces which mixed together really well. A great end to the Skywalker saga in my opinion. Don't listen to the trolls go by your own judgement 👍,1
4028,9.0,"Shut up haters! Although it wasn't as glorious as ""Endgame"" I thought it was great. I like Rey, Finn, C-3PO, BB-8, maybe Ben, and of course Master Luke.",1
4029,9.0,"With ""The Rise of Skywalker"", the leading cast Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley show their finest acting of all three ""Star Wars"" movie, they participated on. The production led by Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams is rock solid down to his final cut appearance.",1
4030,6.0,"So I don't think this is the worst Star Wars film of all time nor even the worst film of all time but it does have its issues. And I can view each film of a franchise, particularly Star Wars, on their own merit. Meaning my opinion on this film doesn't dictate or change my views on the other sequel trilogy films.",0
4031,1.0,"If I could remove the memory of this movie by having my fingernails pulled out with needle nose pliers, it would be a fair deal.",0
4032,5.0,Thanks to Rian and his TLJ we got this rushed movie and our old friend the senate even though it makes no sense.,1
4033,1.0,They missed the chance to make something great again. They just don't know how to write good stories anymore. As a big Star Wars fan I'm really disappointed.,1
4034,8.0,"A surprisingly good film to end the trilogy. It was better than The Last Jedi but not as big as The Force Awakens. It's a darker film than it's predecessor and it was great to see Emperor Palpatine. The only downside is that no one really dies in Star Wars, there either dying and get healed or die and come back as a ghost. So I'm thinking the next film could be called Star Wars: N.E.R.D",1
4035,9.0,I saw the original STAR WARS in 1977 as a 6 year old little tyke. 40 plus years later and they are still making movies in this incredible franchise!,1
4036,10.0,Ignore the negative toxic reviews from so called sw fans these people giving toxic reviews are pathetic I love everything starwars The Rise of Skywalker is an excellent enjoyable and emotional movie it bring an end to a phenomenal saga go see it for yourself and enjoy the ride,1
4037,5.0,Finn has now become a sidekick. His only character is basically always concerned with what's Rey doing and he loves to scream it in this movie.<br /><br />The knights of Ren were lame as hell and were never a real threat.<br /><br />The First Order being General Hux is so obvious as he's the only First Order character we know by names that's still alive besides Ren and some knee General introduced this movie. His reasoning for being a spy is so terrible too it's because he hates Kylo Ren so much he is willing to betray the entire first order.,0
4038,5.0,This is my first review ever and I wrote it just because this isn't Starwars as I know it. I mean... it's pretty fun and all and definitely not so bad as people say on here but the next things botherd me:<br /><br />,1
4039,7.0,"The hate is so unnecessary, the movie is pretty insane and although the negative criticism is understandable maybe you should just shut up and enjoy the movie cause its the last star wars there is, its a great experience and things could've been done differently but there has been a lot of work put into this and they really did their best, its not perfect, but its not bad.",1
4040,9.0,"If you love movies and if you love Star Wars, try watching it for yourself. I found it amazing. Lots of great references to the old saga and old style of the Star Wars universe, but done in the modern way of making movies.",1
4041,1.0,"First of all how did the emperor come back. It said that he was cloned but still it hardly explains how.<br /><br />Second of all, the prophecy in 1, 2, 3 star wars movies is ruined. It said that Anakin skywalker was the jedi to restore the balance and destroy the sith. Well in the 6th movie Anakin/Darth vader destroys the emperor and the prophecy is restored. But when the emperor comes back it ruins the prophecy that anakin is the chosen one.<br /><br />Third of all, the movie is too much of a fast pace. One second you're on one planet and the other you're on another planet.<br /><br />Fourth of all the movie is too simple. The movie is basically Rey and Kylo Ren try to race to the planet where the emperor is and Rey finds some difficulties along the way with her friends, and then the good side wins.<br /><br />Fifth of all, Rey is too OP. Even Luke and Anakin lose their battles with proper training, but Rey never loses.<br /><br />Sixth of all, why didn't Ben skywalker appear as a force ghost. Darth vader was evil but then turned good and appeared as a force ghost. The same thing happened with Kylo Ren and he didn't appear as a force ghost.<br /><br />Seventh of all, the side characters like CP3o and BB-8 plus chewbacca are rarely mentioned in the movie.",1
4042,9.0,"It's filled with action from the very beginning till the end of the movie. It has humor, it has ANSWERS to the things we questioned from TFA and TLJ, it has a great story, it has new exciting characters and it looks amazing. The battle between Rey and Ben from minute 1 till the end is amazing, both lightsaber combat and the mental aspect. The new locations are awesome, the way they tackled Carrie Fisher was awesome. I have very few things I don't like about TROS, two of them is the fact that the movie isn't longer and that we don't really get to know who the Knights of Ren or the red stormtroopers are, and that the scale was a bit too big. Maybe a little less resistance fighters and The Final Order ships. The group is together in this movie, it feels like an adventure and it gives me the same feeling as when Luke went to Dagobah.",1
4043,1.0,Since Rian Johnson directed the last Jedi and changed the original plans set up in the force awakens this film tried to cram in a uneven rushed finale. The way they handled Carrie fisher (R.I.P)was not done well either and you could tell they were repeating the same deleted scene over and over again. Any way if you don't see this your not missing out.,0
4044,5.0,"This installment, and the sequel trilogy in general, have cemented in my mind that Star Trek definitely beats out Star Wars now overall.",1
4045,3.0,Disney destroyed this series...<br /><br />This is an achievement.<br /><br />It is better to give money to the poors instead of spending in Star Wars...<br /><br />Or forget this series and create something new...<br /><br />A completely new story!,0
4046,3.0,"For two years people were rambling about their damaged goods The Last Jedi did to them, blaming Rian Johnson for destroying Star Wars, the whole franchise. This was going on for two years non-stop to the point Disney slowly put down their arms and decided to please as many people as they can.",1
4047,3.0,As a big time fan from comics to the movies and canon to expanded universe i have to admit that this trilogy was a bad recycle of ep 4-6.The first half was enjoyable but as the movie was ending it was super predictable and at some points ridiculus on the turn of the events. A bad remake overall making ep 1-3 seem a masterpiece,0
4048,3.0,To say the 3rd trilogy is/was a mess is a understatement but it did have a couple of cool moment.,0
4049,8.0,All the bitterness and hatred for this film is not from Star Wars fans. Yes the original trilogy will always be the best. Yes there are many things I hated about the prequels and many things I hate about the sequels.,1
4050,6.0,They threw everything into this movie. All the items and legends of the saga were thrown into a movie in the hope that something will stick.,0
4051,7.0,"Now going into this, I have yet to rewatch this even though it dropped on Disney plus last week so this opinion can be and is subject to change. Despite what the divisive reviews said I went into seeing this film at my local movie theater months ago with an open mind and optimism, I'm glad to say I liked the film, Was it perfect? No, was it great? Not really but it was good nothing more nothing less. Some parts I enjoyed (Closing out Leia's arc, the Galaxy Fleet coming to aid the Resistance boys, Ben's redemption etc) and others I didn't or would change (Rey burying Anakin/Luke's and Leia's lightsabers in sand, the Final Battle at Exegol, Hux being the spy just to name a few) even then I didn't necessarily hate the movie. Is it worse than AOTC or TPM like many say? No it's not but it's definitely not up there in my ranking for SW movies. I think what mainly hurt this film from being great or a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga was there was only so much JJ Abrams himself could do after the disappointment<br /><br />and mess that was of TLJ. One thing I mainly disliked about this film was *Minor spoilers so heads up*",0
4052,9.0,"From a chat.....<br /><br />they did not ruin anything! see the movie 5 times! there are symbols and a hidden message within the film! it is all about this message and the film's action is like a satellite around it, which could not have been built better for the message to be delivered. of course there are some tweaks here and there that were required(i did not like: the 2 falcon mirrored in the light speed dance, Rey lack of flow in the landing from her training session, lack of come down on the other side of the wave when she was the skipper , as if we do not have to rush to see what.s on the other side; nice allegory though; the fact that the scenes were pictured too fast, from too close or too far distance, and was not too pleased for the eyes, but maybe it is my only point of view; some scenes were forced/ unnatural- kiss , Ben - Solo talk, the spy revealed scene, Ben 's death; nice idea with emperor 's lightning: for a moment it took me to a different direction, which was nice- i thought of Shakespeare and that they will all die that moment lol; nice Shakespearean end but Ben could have fallen differently. I enjoyed the most the scene when they are on the field and the huge waves behind, maybe because it looked similar to the place where I live. Palpatine was awesome: i think he played for the whole team: his attitude and his well chosen words transformed his role into something Extraterrestrial; he was phenomenal. I also have nice words for the other actors and the whole crew there. I would have given 10 but , gave it only 9 because of the fast , too close and too far filming , not seeing too much of the surrounding like in Rogue One for example.) but as a whole , the film was well built and same as the dagger helped Rey to get to that clue reaching her next goal, the same , the film itself points out clues within itself to get to that secret message to be delivered to those who have eyes to see; i think that is what art does - it delivers a message , and everybody sees it the way they want, and that is the beauty of it.",1
4053,1.0,This movie ruined Star Wars for me forever... and I didn't think that was a possibility.,0
4054,8.0,Seems like everyone has their own version of how Star Wars should end. Just enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a good (great for this trilogy) film. And the plot is really not difficult/ convuluted/ hard to follow.,1
4055,9.0,"Has the most action in a Star Wars movie, a story arc that seems to make up a lot for what The Last Jedi did to this Franchise. Gives Ben Solo's Story arc a nice ending. Although I heard bad reviews for this movie, I actually loved it.",1
4056,1.0,"Convoluted. Messy. Contrived. No character development. Introduction of new characters that we care nothing about because we will never see them again. Pandering too much to The Last Jedi Haters. Raised more questions than it answered. And those questions that were answered feel half-hearted at best. Again, too much fan service happening.",0
4057,9.0,"Look, what do you want? Ships, lasers, lightsabers, and space magic. It's a big ball of frenetic fun and I enjoyed every minute.

Put down the agendas and go have fun, mercy forbid.",1

4060,4.0,"The Star Wars franchise is ubiquitous in many forms of media and across the world. You would be hard-pressed to find someone who has never at least heard of Star Wars. By the time the first three films were released in the seventies and eighties, a massive fandom was created and the influence of the series has grown ever since. Even when the prequels were released, which were considered to be not great movies by many fans, the franchise did not falter.",1
4061,8.0,"The film stated to be the last Episode of an incredible saga. Fans around the world expressed high hopes for the final watch. Wanting unanswered questions to be answered and peace to be regained across the Galaxy, viewers took their seats to witness a farewell from the Galaxy far far away... J.J. Abrams was recalled to directing duty following his work on 'The Force Awakens' and created the dynamics of Rey, Finn and Poe, leading the Resistance's final stand against Kylo Ren and the first order. Following a threat of revenge by the revived Emperor Palpatine, Kylo Ren obtains a Sith wayfinder, leading him to the uncharted planet Exegol (the abandoned planet of the Sith). There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the Dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order - a secret armada of Star Destroyers - and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey, who is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa. Finn and Poe Dameron deliver intel from a spy that Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey has learned from Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO depart in the Millenium Falcon to Pasaana, where a clue to wayfinder is hidden. Palpatine's revival is partnered with an eerie setting - dark and wet - as the Sith Lord presents himself, lightning strikes, revealing his cracked face, symbolic of his lightning powers. Kylo Ren initiates a Force Bond with Rey to discover her location; he travels to Pasaana with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of a Ren. With the help of Lando Calrissian, despite mentioning his days of flying are over, Rey and her friends find a clue - a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from interpreting - and the remains of a Jedi hunter named Ochi and his ship. This following the group minus Lando, falling into a quick-sand substance; thinking their death is imminent, Finn shouts to Rey that he needs to tell her something, this becomes an unanswered question throughout the film. Sensing that Kylo is nearby, Rey goes to confront him. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger; attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning, as Ren watches. Believing Chewbacca is dead, the group escape on Ochi's ship. Rey's development from Episode 6 is astronomical, leading not only her group, but what seems like the Rebellion, her input is concise and important, and her knowledge of the Force is extreme. She, under the surveillance of Leia, becomes the most intelligent, powerful Jedi there has ever been. The group travels to Kijimi, where a droidsmith extracts the Sith text from C-3PO's memory, revealing coordinates to a wayfinder. Rey senses Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission to Kylo Ren's Star Destroyer. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of Ochi killing her parents with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; the Sith Lord had ordered Ochi to recover Rey as a child, but her parents hid her on Jakku to protect her. Following the entrapment of Poe, Finn and Chewbacca, the three are set to be executed by stormtroopers, however the execution is halted by General Hux, who states he wants to do it himself, before firing all the stormtroopers and revealing to the three that he is the 'spy'. He permits the group to escape on the Falcon and asks Finn to blast him in the leg so it looks more realistic, when questioned why he's helping the Resistance, he says he isn't, but he can't let Ren win. Hux is them discovered and killed by the wicked Allegiant General Pryde. The Group finds the wayfinder in the remains of the second Death Star; Rey retrieves it, but she is met by Kylo Ren, who destroys the wayfinder and duels her in the middle of the soaring ocean. In a dying act, Leia calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as Rey impales him during a slow motion feature. Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo and takes his ship to exile herself on Ahch-To. There, Luke's Force spirit encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey leaves for Exegol in Luke's X-Wing fighter, using the wayfinder from Kylo's ship. Meanwhile, Kylo converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo, who reassures him that Kylo Ren is dead, but Ben Solo is very much alive; causing him to throw away his lightsaber and reclaim his identity as Ben Solo. Sensing Leia's passing and Ben's return, Palpatine sends one of his superlaser-equipped Star Destroyer to obliterate Kijimi as a show of the Force. The Resistance, led by Poe and Finn, prepare to attack the Final Order fleet. Kylo Ren freeing himself from the suffering he caused emphasises the blood of Han and Leia that still runs within his veins, echoing the good that Rey was determined to find in him and his capability to show emotion. Rey transmits her coordinates to R2-D2, allowing the Resistance to follow her to Exegol. There, she confronts Palpatine; he demands that she kill him for his spirit to pass into her. Lando brings reinforcements from across the Galaxy to join the battle, with the famous smuggler joining Chewy in the Falcon. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey, but Palpatine drains their power to rejuvenate himself. He attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning and incapacitates Ben. Weakened, Rey hears the voices of the past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but kisses Rey deflects it using the Skywalker lightsabers, killing him and herself. Ben uses the Force to revive her at the cost of his own life; Rey kisses Ben before he dies in an emotional scene. The Resistance defeats Palpatine's armada, while people across the Galaxy rise up against the First order. The Resistance returns to their base to celebrate. After the celebration, Rey visits Luke's abandoned childhood home on Tatooine and buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own. A passerby asks her name; hesitantly, she replies, ""Rey Skywalker"", after seeing the spirits of Luke and Leia watching on. Fitting that as two Skywalker's fall, one rises, hence the title. Episode 8 reflects on the Rebellion's resilience throughout the First Order's many attacks. The conclusion of the incredible Star Wars saga features the end of Leia and Luke but the rise of Rey. Returning to Tatooine, where the initial Skywalker had risen, and where the new one can do the same. Although Rey's introduction to the Force took time, she was able to show off her attributes in battle. Throughout the saga, we are presented with numerous Jedi's, masters, apprentices, members of the council, and their partnered droids - many Sith, under the surveillance of the evil Emperor Palpatine, who was once Chancellor. Prestigious lightsaber's in different colours, various casing and even fire. Ships and fighters that helped bring peace to the Galaxy, from the Millennium Falcon, to TIE fighters and X-Wings. Not to mention bases that were structured as ""super-weapons"". The unsung heroes that captured the schematics for the powerful construction of the Death Star, the other story showing the past difficulties and build-up of one of the Galaxy's best pilot. An iconic film series directed to excellence. Historic!",1
4062,2.0,"JJ had the probably insurmountable task of course correcting from Rian Johnson's many mistakes in The Last Jedi on top of ending the trilogy, and though I had hope that somehow JJ would pull it together, this movie was a mess. Somewhere, amongst all the inane side plots and failed action scenes, there's a good movie - if I were able to edit what's in TROS to make it actually watchable, step one would be to cut out all the (many!!! And incredibly, dully, badly acted!!!) parts with Kylo. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was fun seeing Lando again and Finn was treated better than he was in The Last Jedi (though that's an incredibly low bar).",0
4063,4.0,The lack of structure in the sequel trilogy doomed this 3rd movie to be this cluster of stories and course corrections. I feel bad for J.J. Abrams who did a good job with The Force Awakens and now had to finish a trilogy that was going nowhere after The Last Jedi.,0

The way they've used the force in this movie is not just bad but ruins all of the rich star wars stories that came before it. Same can be said for the big bad(you know who). It simply makes no sense!!,0
4068,3.0,Please watch the Last Mandalorian to see the direction the franchise should go. Disney give the job to Mr Favreau what brilliance of a series. What I saw in the cinema tonight was Star Wars but not as I remember it. Thankfully it's the last one .,1

4073,8.0,"JJ Abrams had his hands full trying to give this movie the respect it deserved, considering the abysmal state of the franchise after Rian Johnson's disastrous episode. It paid appropriate homage to the original trilogy, which should assuage the classic franchise fans after TLJ left a bad taste in their mouths.

Courage to do something new apart the previous trilogys. keep the essence from the past but not a remake of it. Landon did the same. the rescue of two heroes but nothing especial.,0

On the opposte if you're not a fan you will not understand most of the references. At this point I'm sure about the target audience the producers were looking for. There are way too much childish jokes that will ruin all the moments that are supposed to be epic, if you're six years old it's nice otherwise it's just lame.<br /><br />And I think that they shot the whole moving having in mind a really young audience. The colours and the shooting stile is a lot like the Marvel movies but the plot is more suitable for kids, there is no drama everything goes surprisingly well against every odd, the main characters are invincible and the villains are just mean people without a real purpose except being bad.<br /><br />A very disappoint end for the saga.",0

Having said that I would give this effort a 7.5 or so and rank it about 5th of the 9 Star Wars movies behind The Force awakens . The action and special effects were excellent and seeing Leia,Hans, and Luke one last time was worth the ride. One thing that isn't working for me is Rey and Finn's possible more than friendship. I was pleased that Finn seemed to find love with Rose in ""The Last Jedi "" and the friendly introduction for Poe to Rey at the end seemed like a possible Leia - Hans romance in the offing. It wasn't to be and an opportunity lost. One reason Star Wars IV- VI all got ratings over 8 was because they all had humor and Romance - None of the other 6 stars wars had both.

When you look at it as more of a sequel to Return of the Jedi then a sequel to The Last Jedi then it sits much better. In fact much of the film seems to stick a finger up at its predecessor, Kylo Rens' opening quest tells The Last Jedi how it's done; get map, go to destination, find Palpatine - Tick!

It did not feel like a Star Wars adventure (when even movies like Rogue One and Han Solo barely captured a Star Wars feel). Confusing in a non-mysterious way. Mysteries have excitement and wonder, when this movie had baffling fumbles and letdowns. Episode 9, the last movie of a trilogy, left me sad and confused with many unanswered questions that I will not bother to read a book or Disney+ show to find out unanswered questions. Nothing memorable about this film which is why I will not view it again in theaters. This is not what kind of movie people want to wait so many years following a trilogy to see.

4105,8.0,"One thing all these negative reviews are forgetting is that JJ was truly given an impossible task for this movie. He originally set up a trilogy and it is a known fact that for the second film Rian Johnson purposefully changed large aspects of the story to subvert expectations. As a result it made it to where we had a set up film heading off in one direction for ep7 and then doing a complete 180 for ep8. He had to take a fragmented story with no clear direction and a split and extremely vocal fanbase and somehow make one movie to try and appease everyone. I think given these facts this movie was amazing. I walked in thinking it was impossible to please anyone and walked out thinking that while this movie is as many people have been saying ""a lot"" it does connect the dots and make events from both of the sequel movies make a little more sense. Was it perfect? No. Was it what I was wanting to happen in a sequel trilogy? No. But given where we were at and JJ only having this movie to fix it I think it was amazing.",1

The best thing about the sequel and this movie is by far Kylo Ren and Adam Driver's performance. His portrayal was brilliant. Storywise this saga has fallen from grace. Say what you want about the prequels but the plot, characters and lore was outer worldly. Lucas has an imagination without equal. The story just feels very flat. They shouldn't have brought Palpatine back, Finn and Poe and their stories feels insignificant, and the movie is in general too fast faced focusing on the action instead of the plot/characters. Worst of all, this movie or rather JJ Abrahams/Disney have shown little respect to the movies and lore prior to the sequels. This movie is so divisive that it feels like you have to choose between acknowledging either the old SW movies or the sequel trilogy as the real SW and the other almost as non-canon. The old SW movies and the sequel trilogy are not coherent movies. Lucas' legacy is in flames and especially Anakin Skywalker's. I wouldn't rate this a 1/10 as a lot of the users have done because I don't consider this movie to be a bad one, it's just not a great movie when you consider it to be the ending of the Skywalker saga. Too many bad decisions were made. It's not the ending we wanted.",0

JJ Abrams has rescued them in this movie and given them the legacies they deserve. Many of the critic reviews vilify JJ for ""pandering to the fanbase"". I commend and thank him for recognising that it is the Star Wars fans that have made this saga more than just a series of movies.

Jar Jar Abrams, on the other hand, fumbles this in the exact opposite way he fumbled TFA. In the Sequel trilogy opener, we watch him bore us half to death until a satisfying ending with a quality lightsaber fight and a villain who's intriguing family issues drive any interest in the trilogy. In this one, however, he delivers a simplistic (from a story writing angle) but nonetheless entertaining first 4 acts. The gang's little quest of shenanigans feels almost as close as Disney can use cash to conjure to the original magic. Jar Jar shows his lack of spine in the end, though, in his over-the-top self congratulatory botching of the finale. The character development halts before any satisfying conclusion, the relationships lose any meaning outside of their plot relevance, and the final showdown goes from bursting with potential to crumbling under the weight of the apathy it causes the viewer towards the entire Disney modus operandi.",0

I wonder if they filmed that scene in the same location as Lost? I bet this guy is Lando.. Wow that was a fast scene!

I like Marvel movies, but Star Wars isn't Marvel. And they can't do it as good as they can. But the bad outweighs the good for the most part, I'd say it was definitely the best of the sequel trilogy. The Force Awakens was okay, The Last Jedi was boring (I almost forgot literally everything that happened in that so yeah), but Rise of Skywalker was pretty good.

Some gripes I had was they didnt explain how Palpatine came back and I wish they wouldve shown Kylo as a force ghost at the end.

There were many questions omitted in the past trilogies that needed answers, and many questions in the present trilogy.

However it turned out, he can make a good movie in the end apart from some stupid mistakes here and there still, I think he or director in vain try hard so much to be more authentic than the original predecessors, they actually forgot sense and reason time to time. Through-out the whole end-trilogy, particular events had either no sense of what was actually needed or the opposite way around over-hyped and over-exaggerated.

Despite this I did enjoy the story overall despite a few elements feeling like forced fan service that either justified or poked fun at Rian Johnsons vision in The Last Jedi.

Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was great he might be the only character along with poe wwho i actually cared about through the entire sequel trilogy he does a great job with his character.

4147,4.0,"As stated, aside from the cinematography and music, i only watched for the emo mess which was Ben Solo. Whilst its true, Adam's acting may not of been amazing in general in comparison to everyone else's it was incredible. The battle between Rey and Ben in the rain was beautiful if not choppy due to the new 'imma just stop the lightsaber with the force lolz'. The whole film was also insanely choppy yet i suppose JJ had a lot to cover up, not that he did it well. The concept of the film, Rey's dark past, the final battle and collection of ships, Rey and Ben being a dyad in the force, all varying ranges of interesting. Carried out completely wrong. Rey being a Palpatine? Not original whatsoever, when did palpatine have a kid anyways? But if it was done well, it definitely could've been interesting as it does follow the idea of bad trying to be good and Ben's good trying to be bad. The final order (is that what it was called??) that fight scene was okay i suppose, definitely belittled Leia's impact of the world though as nobody turned up when she reached out. YET AS IVE SAID WITH EVERYTHING if it was done better, ie script, some acting etc, then it would have been so much more monumental and emotional in general and felt more like a finale. RIGHT, ✨reylo✨ a pretty big mess if im being honest, as ive said, Adam Driver's acting carried (and in places hindered ill admit) their whole relationship. Their relationship could've had such a bigger impact if it had more development, instead we had them having the same arguments over and over again only really getting any change when Rey went and stabbed him in their battle on the Endor moon. Force awakens: take my hand. Rise of skywalker: Take my hand. I mean, well, the development only took three films :D The kiss?? I mean while yes, its cool they had that closure, i suppose but i'd have preferred it much more if there was actual romantic tension leading up to it. Yes there was definitely tension between them but it was the questioning of who would turn. The part where they both stood in front of the emperor, blue lightsabers ready, i was so excited, i finally thought we were going to have an in depth development and redemption filled battle but no. That would've made the kiss so much more worth it. d e v e l o p m e n t JJ this is very key. I understand he didn't have anything really to work with after the half baked trash which was the last jedi, but neither did Johnson with Force Awakens. So all in all, i think 4 stars is fairly reasonable if not very generous. Watch at your own risk.",0

It's not the worst movie ever like some people say but if you compare it to the original movies yeah it's pretty bad.There's no scenario to be honest... Nothing happening in fact. They're running from planet to planet for don't know what just to ""fight"" Palpatine in the end... I hoped to see Anakin so bad but naaahh...

The pandering is almost as bad as the dialogue. What should have been a new, creative entry in the series ends up being essentially Return of the Jedi all over again. Did they grab some ""super fan"" to write awful fan fiction as the script? That's what it seemed like. The movie is all over the place. Routinely is new information, and abilities lobbed in there lackadaisically with no real context, or need. I seriously never thought I could hate a Star Wars movie.

Remember that the first order can track you through hyperspace, as set up in episode 8? Well, the solution to that problem is that you just have to jump really fast in and out of hyperspace. That's it. Every problem that is presented to our heroes is either just solved automatically, by accident or in a throw away line.

I still enjoyed them all BUT the script was not that fancy that some ""old school fans"" seem to claim. Imo SW is about the characters, the environment and the ""force"" (feeling). The story was always about the fight between good and evil, right and wrong and the balance between light and dark and so on..not so deep.

Good new characters, good use of humor (seriously, I only rolled my eyes twice!). We drove nearly 3 hours each way to see it last night, and all the way home, our kids were pumped, going on and on about all kinds of small details they enjoyed, and all of us genuinely surprised it wasn't terrible!

Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right. Disney have rushed this trilogy and were only interesting in milking the cash cow that is Star Wars. The story is so weak it bears no real relevance to it's predecessors. I do think TLJ made it near impossible for JJ to save it. He certainly tried but it was never going to work. Rey, the character never worked for me. Finn, all he does is shout REEEEYYYYYY.... another weak character. The only positive has been Kylo Ren and they even ruined his storyline. Really disappointed... and I've been a Star Wars fan for over 30 years. Go see it yourself.... hope you find it more satisfying than I did.",0
4205,1.0,"This is what you get when you are more concerned with selling products and virtue signalling then telling a good story. The Disney Star Wars movies are so uninteresting, lazy, idiotic, pandering and uncompelling. It's as if they had no outline for this story and stupidly tried to use the older movies as templates. I've never seen a story arch without an arch. Main characters without any real motivation. Even bad films still try to follow a plot, Rise of Skywalker on the other hand... I have no idea what they were thinking or if they we're thinking at all. Rey is an even bigger Mary Sue than ever. She is pretty much in God mode which makes nothing dramatic since she can overcome any conflict with ease. Kylo is still stupid and evil without any reasons and the other characters have nothing else to do. You can remove some of these characters and it won't make a difference or be noticeable. The prequels were garbage, the disney sequels are even worse. Stop giving Disney your hard earned money, they don't deserve it.",0
4206,1.0,"I dont know what to say. The movie is okay. Overall it is like i was watching a movie that is without its soul. Empty on the inside but full of action on the outside.

The Last Jedi was written for people who were not necessarily Star Wars fans and that could have been ok if you wrote a completely compelling story. Unfortunately, the new movies failed in one aspect through that movie: if you're going to tell me that three of my favorites characters of all time did not live happily ever after, that actually they ended horribly, you better have a good explanation why. Until Rise of Skywalker, this was the critical missing piece and it answered that question wonderfully, It provided a gravity to bring this story back to the forefront that made sense to a fan who has seen every movie in the theaters.",0
4208,9.0,"I know this wasn't George Lucas' original vision but considering how butchered The Last Jedi was, this was a whole lot better and for me saved the sequels. I am a massive Star Wars fan and again, I know this isn't the original canon but all in all, it finished well. There is something specific I am pretty annoyed with but I am not going to let that spoilt it. I just am going to separate what is Disney Canon and what is George Lucas Canon.",0
4209,,"Maybe it really was an impossible task. The two previous entries in the Disney trilogy simply left too many things unanswered and the general lack of an overarching leitmotiv prohibited a cohesive narrative which could have served as a framework for the new protagonists. Without that framework Rey, Finn and Poe remain shallow placeholders for a story that never was and without heroes there could be no villain to match them.<br /><br />'The Rise of Skywalker' then tries to pull every heartstring available and presents us with a whole bowl of memberberries but those strings aren't attached to anything and those memories only remind us of what we have lost with the way the sequel trilogy handled beloved icons from a galaxy far, far away. This movie left me drained rather than elated and I walked out of the cinema with a sense of emptyness and loss. The movie looks great but essentially it was all for nothing. One of the greatest stories in movie history ends in a wishy-washy whimper.",0

If you couldn't follow the story then you weren't paying attention to it. And if you think the writing was bad you need to go back to PreK. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",1
4212,4.0,"It was an ok movie but not a good Star Wars movie. It totally ignores the last movie and most of the first movie in the trilogy. The issue is that it is trying to do 3 movies into one. They should have at least 2 movies to show all the plot that was being followed here. The main issue is, they were introducing a whole new villain, his motivations, his power, his co-conspirators and his ships. Then there was this long quest which took the protagonists to many planets (i don't even know as every 10 minutes they were jumping planets). Many old characters were introduced, new ones were fleshed out, light saber battles at various places. However, eveything was rushed. It seemed clear that JJ Abrams said ok this was the story I was supposed to tell you from the start but stupid Disney gave the second movie to Rian Johnson who messed everything up. So I will conveniently ignore that movie and make a new story; I need 3 movies to tell this story but I will do it in one. Imagine Lord of the Rings series - and now imagine the whole plot of 3 movies being squeezed into one movie. That is what this movie was like.The good things: The special effects were great but it was just too rushed. Anyhow it was fun, not a single minute was wasted. However, to achieve various plot points, the movie suffered from too many large plot holes and as usual stupid decisions by the enemy every 2 minutes.",0

4218,6.0,"Review:<br /><br />'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' is an epic-space opera film directed by J. J. Abrams. It is the third installment of the 'Star Wars' sequel trilogy, and the final episode of the nine-part ""Skywalker saga"". The film follows the surviving Resistance as they face the First Order once again.<br /><br />This is the most mixed 'Star Wars' movie that has been made thus far in the franchise. Critics didn't like it, and some die hard fans were not impressed by. I actually thought it was enjoyable, though slow at times.<br /><br />You can tell when people blindly judge a movie, because they go into a review and talk about everything that is wrong with the film and not talk about the positives. The acting much like the other two films that came before it was good. There isn't anything special about it, but the actors did a good job keeping us engaged with likable characters. Though, I personally think Daisey Ridley is fantastic and she was great in this movie.<br /><br />The movie does have some trouble with pacing, and I found myself at times looking at my watch to see how much time went by. When the movie does bring some action, it incredible. It's very well choreographed and highly entertaining. I do find the end to be a little sloppy and it seemed like they were in a hurry to end it, which is unfortunate given this is the final movie.<br /><br />Overall, I won't go at far as to say it is a boring movie, because its not. It's an entertaining film, but it has some pacing issues that U feel could have been avoided. I still recommend seeing this movie if you are even just a casual 'Star Wars' fan such as myself.<br /><br />3/5",1

Maybe it's from the overload of star wars to the fans. We all want these films to be best it can be but they need to fix their long term plans and stop thinking in short term gains.,0
4226,1.0,"I don't get why they needed to kill off the last Skywalker, when the title was The Rise of Skywalker. Should have just named it The Rise of Palpatine. Kylo Ren had the most interesting character arc, and now instead of showing more of redeemed Ben Solo, which was oh-so good! They were busy showing off the three silly stooges on a quest hunt at the beginning of the movie. Will not, and never understand the decision to kill off Ben Solo. I get that they want to end the Skywalker saga, but really there was no need to kill him off. They really could have just let him live and just carry on making other Star Wars movies that has no Skywalkers in them. But nope, just kill off the last Skywalker and give the name to a Palpatine instead. Which the last Palpatine - now Skywalker - will most likely never start up the Jedi again ever.

The characters were strong and driven. The direction and special effects were good. It just seemed like a movie we'd already seen. By the end we were paying attention but I think we've about rung this out for all it is going to provide. They left a clue for a future Star Wars but, meh. The MADOLORIAN is much better, much more fun, much more engaging. The big controversy over the gay kiss was just hype, as usual. If you weren't looking for it you wouldn't see the 1% in the background. I read where some countries had them edit it out. Meh. Overall a fun ride but I think they are done.",1

I have seen every Star Wars film in the theatre since my father took me to see Return of the Jedi as a child (my favorite part of the original trilogy and yes I know Empire is better) so I'm not new to the film at all. This is not a bad movie, while people are entitled to their own opinion, in my opinion the way the nitpick this movie is ridiculous. I loved the special effects , the fight scenes, and the way the characters have grown and changed over the course of the films. I hope this isn't the last time we see them. I thought the Force Awakens was ok because it was just a rehash of a new hope to me, and I thought the Last Jedi was clearly a move away from the Skywalker story arc but this movie was a good attempt to reconcile everything.

4244,8.0,"And this was a fantastic film. It was certainly a little busy feeling at the start, but there were a couple of moments to reflect and let things sink in. What this film did give us was some incredible nostalgia (felt like the original films) incredible acting visuals and score, the best lightsabers battles of any of the films, , and left you with a feel-good finale.<br /><br />I loved the little jabs about certain aspects from TLJ thrown in, but there was nothing close to a retcon here (nothing needed to be fixed from TLJ in my opinion)..<br /><br />Anyone giving this a score below a 6 is ridiculous, as are the 10/10. The OT movies were like swiss cheese with pot holes and other errors (theatrical versions, the special editions are almost as awful as prequels), and still great. I don't understand people's issues now. It's just a hate bandwagon. So thankful to have been able to finally have a follow up Star Wars trilogy after waiting since 1983!<br /><br />Second point deduction was because no film is perfect, so a 9 is the highest score I would give out.",1

This film churns through so much plot so quickly that it rarely has time to engage the emotions, thrill, or excite. All of the performers, especially Daisy Ridley, turn in great performances. However, the new cast does not have the chemistry needed to sell the film's suggested camaraderie. Few truly new ideas are presented in this film, which suggests this should be the last.",1

4250,5.0,I decided not to take in consideration the reviews before going to see the movie. I went in the theater with hope that this would be another movie which the fans misunderstood. BOY WAS I WRONG.,0
4251,3.0,"Let me just say that Star Wars is one of the most overrated franchises of all time, but this Trilogy almost changed my mind. The Originals had no interesting characters and no good world building and the same for the prequel trilogy. I will admit the prequels did have a few good movies, but that last one was super embarrassing. Why do I like this film? Rey Skywalker! Her character development in all three movies are so amazing, but I was literally crying when I watched this one. There's so many good things in this movie, but one of the things that stands out to me the most is the amazing way they introduced Palpatine back into the franchise. Normally I don't care about Palpatine, but the line ""somehow Palpatine has returned."" sent shivers down my spine. Finn's character in this movie is even better than his character in the previous movies. Whenever he screams ""Rey!"" you can just feel his pain. Although I will admit it was a pain that Rose didn't play more of a role in this movie. Rey's character is filled with deep emotion and depth. And I remember that I literally cried in the theaters when I heard the line ""Rey Skywalker."" In other Star Wars movies you have cringe Marty Stu characters like Luke and Anakin. However, with Rey you can tell she went through so much pain and hard work to become so powerful. However, this movie still has it's flaws. Kylo Ren! He is basically the only character this Trilogy that is extremely boring and uninteresting to watch. His design is almost as bad as Darth Vader's. Also why should I feel bad when he kills Han Solo? Han Solo is literally one of the most annoying and overrated characters of all time. The Sequels are filled with underrated characters like Captain Phasma. And another annoying thing about Kylo Ren is that his Redemption Arc makes no sense. How can someone who has killed so many people become a good person? Try explaining that cry baby kylo fans. Thank goodness he died at the end though. Although I would have preferred if he just died by falling off a cliff. Because a trash character like that doesn't deserve any sort of memorable death. The most epic scene in this movie is when Rey says ""And I...... am all the jedi!"" Rey was the best choice for the person to kill off Palpatine. The writing in this movie is just overall really really good. It has basically zero plot holes. This film is overall just a masterpiece! I'm just wondering why they can't make more Masterpiece Star Wars movies like this.😭😭😭 You can tell Disney is telling you that they're done with these stupid original trilogy characters when they kill off Leia. Even though I didn't like the Reylo kiss because I hate Kylo I will admit it was set up really well. I just think she should have gotten together with Finn. That would have been one of the most beautiful love stories in the world and most interesting ones at that. I think that we can all agree that when it comes to Star Wars movies it's better to go out with the old and in with the new. Say goodbye Empire Strikes Back. Hello Rise of Skywalker!",0
4252,2.0,"The special effects and sound teams get a pat on the back. Everyone else should hang their head in shame. Story, script, and acting was infantile. Muddled, amateurish, and rushed.

4253,9.0,Travel a large distance. Enter the theatre with friends. Take my seat. Relax. 2.5 hours of pure escapism. Loved it. That's what anticipation does to the greatest sci fi saga ever created. Star Wars will not end now. Shame it took the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney to generate this new wave of creativity.<br /><br />Why do people get so mad over the new films? 1 out of 10? Maybe something you thought was going to happen didn't? Get over it.,1
4254,10.0,"I've been around for a while, Grew up on the original trilogy, got excited for the prequels and anticipated this recent trilogy. I admit I was one of those who hated the prequels but learned to apreceate them and eventualy love them and with this trilogy I didn't like the first two. So when I enetered ""The rise of skywalker"" I had no expectations, was open minded even though I have already read the hatred online. My only hope was that it would make sence of the first two and would be fun. And it did both spectaculerly. What people where complaining about was that the first act was a rushed up mess, that the second act was boring and that the final act was over the top and non relatable and here is what I got; act 1 establishing plot, act 2 adventure is on, act 3 epic conclusion. The best thing I an say about this installment is that Rey gets an arc and an interesting one as well. Po also gets to be three dimensional and finn meets a character that help defines him better. Another complaint I read online is that ""The Last Jedi"" was completley ignored... What planet where you on writing that?!? Nothing is ignored from Last Jedi, Luke is still dead, Kylo Ren is still the bad guy, Rey finishes her Jedi training. Well, to conclude - ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is a great adenture that justifys its predecesors in this trilogy and concludes the Skywalker saga like it promises. Go see it!!!!!",0
4255,6.0,Guess I'm just not a huge Star Wars nerd.. this felt like a Michael Bay movie with constant action and explosions etc.. it was just ok to me.. Nothing really stood out and it'll all be forgot in my mind by next week lol.,0
4256,7.0,"Giving 7 stars only means the storyline looks off, or not incredible enough. I get the feeling this is gonna last, but some closure are not clear enough for instance a relationship between Rey and Finn, and looks like were never gonna find about ""what is it you gonna say?"", hmmm never get that answers anymore. After all, you cant deny their performance but well it seems this last movie does not attract me enough, im feeling decent, maybe because theres no avengers anymore???",0
4257,2.0,"Bozo the clown does Star Wars. Remember Episodes I, II and III - how everyone was like 'Lucas what did you do?' I would gladly take him back. Why did Ren and Rey kiss?

This movie was done well after the catastrophy of Last Jedi with room for improvements but this has lived up to its hype and a lot of people have also said that this is the best of the trilogy. Critica have given this movie good ratings and so have celebs. Don't believe haters on this platform,0

4261,2.0,"I slept lightly I think like 25 minutes waking up and nodding in, but at least 15 minutes in deep sleep. If you are in need for rest of your daily work or family life and sorrow, go watch this thing man! So relaxed, the clichés they do, the b-movie actors who could not even convince my alzheimer grandma and the 'hand of God' story which must have been written by a 7 year old kid. It all felt very comfortable and relaxing. I hope I was not snoring to much, but my neighbors seem to be more interested in their iPhones while chewing on lousy cinema food, so I guess it was ok. I must admit I missed the last 45 minutes because sleeping during the day makes me hungry and I went out to get some unhealthy fast food. The rest of the movie I could kinda guess. All in all very nice to get some inner peace.",0
4262,3.0,"Palpatine is back... I'm NOT against it, although I feel like they should have used him properly. Palpatine is THE sith of Star Wars and Anakin is THE CHOSEN ONE. Rey's part in this story feels forced since we didn't get anything from her character arc in the first two films, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. I'm not a fan of The Last Jedi and it's a film that has become even more disconnected from the story after the Rise of Skywalker which should please me. I don't like it at all because this movie felt the need to redo everything from The Last Jedi which just resulted in a disingenuous trilogy. I love the originals and like and somewhat love the prequels and I really did enjoy The Force Awakens. In my opinion The Force Awakens was the right amount of familiar and new to set up the new Star Wars. The Last Jedi took me for a spin and a twist which I didn't enjoy at all and now we got this mess of a movie. The funny thing is that the most appealing character in this story is not the lead Rey but the antagonist Kylo Ren (Ben Solo), making her a Palpatine didn't help that one bit. There are some great scenes in this movie but NOTHING connects this trilogy to the prequels which is seriously confusing. Anakin Skywalker is the chosen one but now Rey is I guess? Palpatine returns, but Anakin don't, not even Luke Skywalker gets a serious redemption in this movie. This trilogy is a serious mess and, in some ways kinda insulting because it's advertised as the conclusion to all the movies we love but they ignore an entire trilogy. Not to mention the ending, Rey kills Palpatine in the matter of seconds, SECONDS!! Kylo Ren/Ben Solo who is the LAST SKYWALKER is just pushed along Reys journey. Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is evil, and now his good, I like it, but does it matter...NO. He does nothing in the end except being unconscious and then giving his life to a character we don't really care about, really Disney? I'm thinking I'm done with Disneys Star Wars mess and it's just too bad since there were scenes, arcs and characters that could have been truly, truly, truly great but no. It's over and the ending sucked. I almost feel disgust over how they treated George Lucas vision and his Star Wars universe. This trilogy doesn't matter but Disney's acting like nothing before this matter... This excuse for a trilogy is nothing and I seriously don't consider it connected to George Lucas movies because that would be insulting to myself and George Lucas.",1

Some of the main characters of this trilogy are at their best in this one: Finn and Poe, for example, finally flesh out a bit more completely. The plot throws some curveballs, both dumb and intriguing at the same time. There's a lot of action that makes you wonder, ""Where was THAT in Episode I-VI?!""

There's a kind of empty kinetic energy so that characters don't enter frame so much as burst into frame. You can sense a certain desperation in case attention wanders.

4284,8.0,"As the final chapter of both the sequel trilogy of STAR WARS and the Skywalker saga in general, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER comes with quite a burden. It is a burden that is inevitable with any final chapter in a trilogy, but George Lucas' space saga which began over 40 years ago especially has it tough, particularly when it comes to both the original and prequel trilogies. For the latter, REVENGE OF THE SITH was the best of of an otherwise underwhelming set of prequels, and even then that can sound somewhat backhanded, as it did still contain a lot of the faults of its predecessors. Still, it was at the very essence, the least flawed of the prequels and certainly servicable, which is more than could be said about the likes of THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES. RETURN OF THE JEDI meanwhile, was something of a (minor) step down from the fantastic duo of A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, respectively. That said, RETURN OF THE JEDI was no slouch, and only marginally inferior. It still delivered lots of memorable sequences and was a fitting closure to the original trilogy.",1

The movie made you feel good so you liked it, ok valid point but saying the movie is good is wrong on so many levels.

4303,10.0,Fun movie! Just sit back and enjoy Star Wars! Of course it's not perfect but it's actually so fun. As a fan of star wars I was happy to see so many great characters!,1
4304,6.0,"There is nothing bad about this movie except... there's nothing good about it either. Nothing exciting, nothing really new. No matter how much a sequel a movie is, you need to have some findings. Nothing here. No narrative arch, not even some outstanding visuals. Just a collection of fan checkboxes completed and credit titles",0
4305,6.0,"Not the biggest Star Wars fan. More just I see each movie when they come out. This was definitely a step up from Last Jedi, which was the worst, but it was far from the original 3. Best in the trilogy though. The first 15-20 minutes felt rushed. They crammed way too much in that beginning that the movie was overwhelming at first. It delivers on action though. The Palpatine twist was great. Honestly didn't see that coming. The final battle was very reminiscent of the 3rd act of Endgame, which is good in some ways, bad in others. The whole 2nd half of the film was honestly a little to close to endgame. Closes the franchise in a good way. In my opinion they should just stop here and continue the spinoff films and shows and not focus on a bigger story. Big fans should be very pleased, though not amazed and casual viewers might not be as thrilled.",0
4306,8.0,"The epic conclusion to the Skywalker saga is finally here, and it doesn't disappoint! From the opening crawl to the final scene, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is a thrilling and emotional ride for both die-hard fans and casual moviegoers.",1
4307,8.0,I really enjoyed Rise of Skywalker and I was prepared to be disappointed.,1
4308,10.0,"Star Wars didn't need any sequels at all but we were given them and boy have they been a rollercoaster. Force Awakens was just adrenaline from Star Wars returning. The Last Jedi had some of the hype and wasn't the most loved by everyone. But boy oh boy was Rise of Skywalker a finale. Forget Avengers, this is the best finale of the year. Constantly changing emotions on my face non-stop. Laughing, crying, shouting at characters l and cheering others. This story ties up any and all questions that have been raised and exceeded every expectation I had at all. Perfect send off for Leia and satisfying ending for yet another trilogy of Star Wars. The force was clearly with them all.",1
4309,8.0,"Not a perfect film by any means with a lot of decisions have been made just to try and appease the people that had such a ridiculous problem with last jedi (rose is hardly in it,rey palpatine,reylo,last order ect) but anyone trying to say there is no enjoyment to be had are just wrong,salty and toxic, as a starwars uberfan the cameos,in jokes and set pieces alone made it a thoroughly enjoyable end to the whole thing!",1

4315,10.0,"I have been a stars wars fan my entire life. It's a tall task to even attempt to continue this saga, after the success of episodes 4, 5 and 6. let alone make them as good as they have been. I'm just glad someone took over the reigns and continued the story. This movie was better than expected, I knew I would love this movie before going in. It was full of action, emotion and gave us some answers we were looking for.<br /><br />With that being said they should kick the ""1"" lovers off IMBD from leaving reviews. Even Sharknado doesn't deserve a one. Geez, give me a break. I think these people are paid for those ridiculous reviews. ""Predictable"", ""plot Holes"" they must be writing their review during the movie instead of watching it. I would be surprised if they ever enjoy any movies they watch. Too busy picking them apart.<br /><br />Anyway it's a great movie and hope there will be more in the future.<br /><br />Thanks",0

4318,2.0,"The movie relies on your childhood memories, a big fan service who ignores plot and coherency. At the same time, a big slap in the face for those who truly love StarWars and it's lore. Anakind journey is worthless and Mary Sue is the all mighty hero that not once get gurt in the whole sequel movies. Good visuals and music (from the original movies). Skip this movie just wait for streaming",0

Of course it is free. it is pushed by the Devil and his minions. Be warned it has no recognition of Jesus or President Trump. A woman defeats the man and sings temptations in his ear and bestows death on him. The witch then becomes the mistress but the demon (which like most demons appears in the shape of enchantress that is thin and comely but cannot disguise her accent) is tricking our youth into perfidy, abortion and probably voting for COMMUNISTS.",0
4326,7.0,"I've seen all the star wars movies so I am a fan of the series; although I if I see a bad star wars film, it doesn't outrage me to supernova-sized proportions. I might be temporarily disappointed, bordering on contempt, but then I 'forget' about it, and move on to something else. Therefore, while I care about how good or bad a star wars film is, I have no axe to grind: No requirement to tear it a new one. I try to review it without undue prejudice. I will therefore not be an outraged fan; faux or otherwise. It will not trample on my dreams, even if I admit the phantom menace was shockingly bad. I just have no wish to watch it again - it's a film, after-all. Phantom menace came and went alongside those ill-judged Yoda commercials and the irksome Jar-Jar Banks interjections. I was therefore temporarily disappointed with the above but the world somehow will carry-on.",0
4327,9.0,"Has all you want in a film...just go there and enjoy it. No reason to dig deep they give you the answers they even open more of the sith lore...smart. For what and what you get its very good. Action good, story good, ending done well. Poe the new han 👍. I paid ten bucks for a universe they made. Good job. Only thing i wanted was a hook into a possible future ""separate"" series.<br /><br />If i was to do the next series it would definitely be far into the future and a whole different group with new problems yet i would tie this past into the lore... Just my opinion. Overall solid film. 👍",1
4328,10.0,What an amazing conclusion to the new trilogy. I'm glad they cut out the scenes with Anakin Skywalker. Rey is the chosen one! She is Rey Skywalker. We all can be Skywalkers. But Rey Skywalker is the ultimate Jedi. I wish Rose had more screen time. Thank you Kathleen Kennedy and JJ. It is my favorite star wars movie of all time!,1
4329,8.0,"This movie is fantastic! Take your kids, go have a good time :-)",1
4330,3.0,"A large part of the movie is a hunt for several macguffins, and it is as uninteresting as it sounds. You may watch it once and then never again.<br /><br />Characters like Lando can be easily replaced by a frying pan.<br /><br />For me the saga ends with part 8. With kids talking about lukes feats and watching to the stars.",1

4335,5.0,"I love Star Wars, but I really dont know what this one was about. Gone to the well one too many times I guess.",1
4336,7.0,"It moved fast and didn't do a lot to focus on any particular plot point or character development but it also concluded the arc of Rey and Kylo, while giving a proper ending to Leia IMO. This is one of those movies I'll need to watch again since I probably missed something but I walked out of the theater smiling after this one.",0

4338,9.0,What a fun final ride on a good Star Wars series.,1
4339,5.0,"The Rise of Skywalker, upon rewatch, is hard to place. Some things I enjoyed, most I hate. And thus, when it comes to rating this, I struggle between a four and a five. Thus I will leave a five to be more lenient, though I must say this movie is pretty dumb at times. While not as bad as The Last Jedi, it certainly is still a bad Star Wars Film. Rewatching all of the films in order shows just how off these sequels feel. If I had to place it amongst my ranking of Star Wars films, it would be just above The Last Jedi. Everything else is basically better. I regret that I ever said this was better than Solo, or Episode 2. At least Episode 2 had some entertaining battles, while this did not. An uneven, directionless film that throws continuity and logic to the wind for spectacle.",0
4340,5.0,I was thinking this watching the movie as the Christopher Nolan kind of had the same issue with the the Dark Knight Returns. At some point t you run out of original ideas and repeat what you've already done. It's not horribly but they have jumped the shark with this last one.,0
4341,6.0,"On the positive side, the movie is decently shot and edited, the CGI mostly OK (except one horrible shot), the music is very good (much better than the previous instalments in that trilogy), there are a lot of different landscapes, aliens etc., and the acting ranges from the decent to the very good (Ian McDarmid, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, and of course a fourth actor who is just there for a cameo and will remain unnamed here, to keep this review spoiler free).",0
4342,6.0,"A film all in all beautiful but disappointing if you look at the rest of the saga. There are enough moments of action and twists throughout the film but there are too many letes that almost fall asleep, then it's all very repetitive and most things seem already seen and others don't really have their heads. The special effects and acting are two wonderful aspects but the plot is perhaps a little disappointing.",0

4347,3.0,"Would like to just say thank you for wasting my valuable oxygen by producing this trilogy, I have no words for the disappointment I have. Would also like to apologise to Adam Driver for having to carry the entire god damn FRANCHISE on his back. Will not say anything specific as to prevent from spoilers but the idea of the force and the capabilities of an individual from the first 6 films are just completely thrown out the window and converted into blasphemy. The series has become too involved in trying to shape opinion in real life and has lost not only its individuality but its identity as a whole. Anybody who says that this any of these films are better than a single movie from the first 6 should never watch another film.",0

4352,10.0,"No Spoilers:<br /><br />Rise of Skywalker was excellent. Don't let the critics and fans that refuse to let go of the past and embrace the future fool you. The movie was full of tear-jerking nostalgic moments, it broke new ground in the powers of the Force, and was entertaining from start to finish. Yes, it had mistakes and yes it operates outside the rules of the original trilogy, but I don't really know what else people would expect? I think the biggest problem is that so many people were kids when they saw the originals (and for some the prequels) and since then they have lost that kid-like energy within that allowed them to enjoy Star Wars on a different level. Can you imagine how difficult it was to bring in a new generation and introduce new characters into the most successful and beloved movie franchise ever? At the end of the day that's what this trilogy was. It was a trilogy for a new generation of younglings, while still mixing in everything the original fans loved when we were kids and I don't know how much better it could've possibly been.<br /><br />The sun has set on the Skywalker saga, it's a hard thing to accept, but it was beautiful to watch.",1
4353,9.0,"Right now the movie has a 58% for the critics evaluation on RT. And this is coming from the same critics who gave a 91% to the train wreck that was The Last Jedi. Don't believe them, the movie is awesome! It's Star Wars in its truest essence.<br /><br />People forget that Star Wars has always been a light, somewhat predictable, good vs bad dilema kind of story. Remember: this is not Game of Thrones, where the evil guys sometimes win and it's based on what would happen on the ""real life"". This is Star Wars! The force is strong in the good side! :) Critics and boomer fans praise so much episodes 4, 5 and 6, but everything bad they're saying about episode 9, could be said about 4, 5 and 6 as well.<br /><br />Not only that, Rise of Skywalker spent around 30/40 minutes correcting the story of The Last Jedi. Only then, they start to tell the Rise of Skywalker story... Because of that, I felt that only 2h and 20 min was too short of a time to tell such a great story. I feel that a length of a little over 3 hours would be ideal. That's my only complaint: I WANTED MORE!! lol<br /><br />Bottom line: it's amazing, full of nostalgia, epic battles, good vs evil dilema and emotional... A true amazing ending for the Star Wars saga. And the most amazing thing: they did that after The Last Jedi, and even corrected the bad parts of that movie.<br /><br />Congrats on everyone who was a part of the movie, the fans appreciate the hard work and the great ending of the saga!!",1

4356,10.0,"The Force Awakens was just playing it safe and it wasn't nearly as exciting as it could have been. The Last Jedi was the complete opposite, it was very new and risky but ultimately failed hard because it did't have that Star Wars vibe. Rouge One was actually a good movie but Solo is just ok and a Star Wars movie should never be just ok.<br /><br />And after trial and error they have finally done it, they made a true Star Wars movie!<br /><br />The plot of the movi is great, the acting, the loactions, everything. And when the second half of the movie starts it just grips you to your seat and doesn't let go until the very end. THAT IS WHAT A STAR WARS MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT. I felt the same excitement as I have felt watching the first 6 movies.<br /><br />All in all it's really a great movie and a worthy addition to the franchise. Too bad it's the last one.",0

Whenever something horrible happens like Chewbacca dying, they bring them back 10 minutes later, or they get stuck in quicksand in the middle of the desert only to find the thing that they're looking for. And to find out that the hardest place to get to in the galaxy every random Yahoo in the resistance can get there with ease. And that there's a thousand star destroyers that can destroy a planet just waiting to be released into the galaxy, each of the full crew. I don't understand anything that is going on in this movie, seems like it's written by a 4-year-old who's just rambling on and on about cool ideas that just spontaneously pop in their head. Like all the sequels I could not sit through this without getting upset and having to take a break from its ridiculous story that has so many holes in. I'm only character development is that Finn is a laughing stock (probably due to his ethnic background (real PC disney)), Poe has been reduced to a random Yahoo and Rey it's a SkYwaLkER now. What a slap in the face to George Lucas, I can't imagine how embarrassed he is with these sequels.

4366,9.0,"The end to the Star Wars saga, to me, was phenomenal. I really have loved Star Wars my whole life and grew up on it, it truly was the crux of my childhood. I absolutely love to watch movies with and open mind, and let my self imagine watching the movie as a sort of an emotional event for me, as though the director very likely intended. The movie has some very minor flaws if you could call them that, obvious nitpicking, that a viewer who is unbaised against an admittingly enjoyable film could see.<br /><br />This film truly was a masterpiece, and amazing fan service, that read my mind at the end and was also true to how I would've imagined the story would likely end anyways. The scene where Rey loses her soulmate Ben is truly heart touching and was very satisfying, it reminded me of The Note Book (2004). The action was also very fitting and gave a healthy dose of nostalgia, with new vigor. There were also wholesome moments throughout, of cherished friendships, beginning - and ending. As well as an accompanying sense of a story coming full circle. The emotional climax of this film resulted in levels at or above that which I received from Avengers Endgame, a movie I previously considered to be the best end to a long impact of a movie story spanning across many years. Thank you Disney, though not all admit it, this movie truly was very, very enjoyable if one is not being biased and is invested in the story.",1

4371,6.0,First film I saw in 4DX and it might be the last. Getting water splashed on your face and gust of winds do not seem like something extra to pay for when you watch a film. Over all the film was what I would have expected not being a huge Star Wars fan. I however enjoyed seeing Carrie Fisher brought back to life for one last film. For the big Star War fans I am sure they will love the final of this trilogy.,1
4372,9.0,"I went in with zero expectations and I'm stunned what they pulled off on this one after the wreckage that Ep.8 left behind. I don't dare to dream what even could've been done if it wasn't for part 8 making that big mess. You can tell that they're rushing through to tie all the loose ends and that does hurt the movie. Although it is still far more than watchable and that does by no means ruin it. The movie would've benefitted from cutting out a few of the new characters though. The humor is there, but it isn't out of place like with part 8. It is funny sometimes but in a good way. Most importantly, it got me caring about the plot and characters. It also elaborates more that force powers and abilities differ with every force user and I like that. Bottom line: It has the full essence of what a Star Wars movie is and has to be.",0

4374,6.0,"So. The ninth episode. Was I waiting for him? Waited very strongly. Am I happy after watching? Well...my head exploded and my heart is broken. And when I see an 88% viewership rating on rottentomaters, I know there's no way to fix these fans. They just want to see familiar elements. They're like the Ewoks. Or Gungans. Or Porgy. But I'm a fan too! What's wrong with me? Why did my eyes bleed when I watched that movie? Maybe it's common sense that live in me? Maybe I don't love this universe enough to easily turn a blind eye to all the nonsense that they are trying to sell me under the guise of that very far galaxy? Maybe. But the facts are that the new film is a ridiculous, convulsive attempt to fix all the wrongs committed by Disney's mouse gang. That film is not FANTASTIC. That film is ABSURD. The film has good moments, and visually everything is very beautiful. The general direction of the plot is quite acceptable. But if the storyline was developed within 3 films, harmoniously, logically, it would be at least good. So, what we have in the end? We have SALAD, wildly shredded events that happen just like that, because it looks spectacular fo fans! Frenzied montage, flashes and flashes, the absence of any logic. It's VULGAR, it's MANIPULATING the feelings of the fans. And the most offensive thing is not even that. The most offensive - to see the joyful reviews of people about this part of Star Wars. I'm glad people from my country didn't let themselves be fooled. Our fans are extremely disappointed, and we have a rating of 6.1. But viewers from other countries write exited reviews. How so? How can you praise THAT, after humiliating the prequel trilogy, although after the Disney trilogy, yes even without It, ""The Phantom Menace"", ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" are good movies, this is a logical, literate expansion of the universe from the Creator of this universe.

Yes, Star Wars fans love it, however that means nothing to me other than people whined and complained to get their way because they weren't getting it before.<br /><br />As a whole, it was just alright. The CGI was great, the action was mostly fun, but the writing was mediocre and the movie was just all over the place, which is something Star Wars fans like I guess? This could have been a much better finale to a great saga, following two movies that, in my opinion, are some of the best in the entire series. Say what you want about TLJ, that film was spectacular, shocking and intense. Rise of Skywalker had intense moments, but was ultimately ruined because of fan service sequences generated by awful, childish fans. I wanted to love this film, I really did, but it was messy and cliche, and is easily one of the worst films in the franchise by far.<br /><br />It is still a good goodbye, but it is a moderately unsatisfying conclusion to such a fantastic franchise.",0
4383,1.0,"So I´m not sure if I actually ever reviewed a movie before, but this ""movie"" here truly was so aweful, that I just feel like I really have to warn others. No story, no logic (I mean seriously, Star Wars always used to have logic-holes, but this ""movie"" here has more holes in its logic than it got actual logic) and what disappointed me the most and will probably keep me away from watching another Star Wars in cinemas without recommendations from sources that I feel I can trust, is the obvious lack of understanding for what Star Wars is actually about. In fact the ""movie"" was so bad, I even looked at the acting of the actors - and even that felt horrible to me. So usually I look down on everyone who reviews movies or games with a 1-Star mark, but seriously, this so called ""movie"" is a plain insult to each and every Star Wars fan and thus deserves nothing better, than 1-Star. I truly hope that everyone who participated in the making of this feels ashamed about him-/herself.",0
4384,4.0,"If the movie were not part of a saga and on its own it's a cheesy sci-fi fantasy action flick that isn't boring and dull but it's not on its own, it's Star Wars.<br /><br />So much doesn't make sense:<br /><br />1. How does Palpatine survive a fall down a reactor shaft that produces an explosion that almost blows Vader and Luke off the catwalk and then survive a Nuclear explosion while being at Ground Zero?<br /><br />2. Then since I'm supposed to believe #1 I have to believe he has been able to sustain his life in secret all the while amassing and sustaining hundreds possibly thousands of Sith acolytes plus building a massive fleet of Star destroyers all with Death Star technology on them? All of this without anyone else knowing!<br /><br />3. Since he's alive that means Anakin wasn't the Chosen One that brought balance to the force but we later hear Anakin's voice say ""balance the force as I did before"". Huh?<br /><br />4. It took yoda an entire clone wars arc to learn how to become a force ghost which obi wan learned whilst in isolation but now every effen Jedi is a ghost and can contact Rey?<br /><br />5. Rey is massively OP for no reason other than Plot. Why? Because she palpatine's granddaughter? Why wouldn't his kid have force sensitivity? Why would it be stronger in a grandchild than a child?<br /><br />I'm so confoozed",0
4385,6.0,"This film focused far too heavily on Rey, at the expense of the ensemble cast that worked well in the previous movies. Finn is mostly reduced to the role of just Rey's friend. Poe, also, had very little to do. Kylo Ren is arguably the only character to have any sort of decent character development, but I hate the direction they go with him. The other villains are either forgettable or poorly written. The point is that this film seems to have so many characters and situations with no good reason other than nostalgic purposes. Some of the relationships are totally cringy. But the fight sequences are very entertaining with the surroundings where the fight takes place, in combination with the rousing score, makes it into a spectacle. The best aspect for me, is probably the incredible special effects, Another is John Williams' score, which is typically brilliant.",1
4386,6.0,The final scenes are the same as avengers endgame. It is so boring.,0
4387,8.0,"Star Wars, a saga that gave us so much for 42 years, and that lost in the latter, returns to recover the magic lost in the last films. Although it has plot failures, script holes, etc., that were shown in the films of the last trilogy, this installment is a great closure for the Skywalker saga. It has great, epic and even emotional scenes for all fans who follow the saga. Visually the movie is 10 points. As for the fight scenes between ships, they are spectacular. Something that bothered me was the simplicity of the script, I will not go into detail so I do not give spoilers, but most of the moments are very predictable which makes the experience for the viewer is not so exciting. Anyway, it is a good movie to conclude the story, highly recommended to see with Star Wars fans. If they like Star Wars, they have to go urgently. May the force be with you.",1
4388,8.0,I'm not going to rave about this movie but I'm also not going to say it's the worst ever. It's a tough decision between rating it 7 or 8 but I'll bump it to 8. I do wish they would've went with one person to run all three movies in this trilogy. There is a bit of damage control it seems as the movie rushes through most scenes.,0

4390,2.0,How embarrassing.,0
4391,1.0,"The story was very predictable and uninteresting. Way to much cgi during action sequences made it very boring. It tried to be too cute overall. It's basically a Star Wars marvel movie, and marvel movies are some of the worst being made currently. I didn't find myself caring about any of the characters at all. I would go see this movie one time and be good forever. It requires one viewing and that's it because nothing even happens and what does happen just doesn't matter. Disney and jj abrams have singlehandedly made a flaming pile of crap. Of course marvel nerds will like it because they are looking through cringe and nostalgia tinted glasses. This film has little to no originality and creativity. Please hate this movie along with marvel movies for the sake of humanity.",0

I therefore had to see the final episode and what better I thought than in IMax 3D. I can only agree with the vast majority of the people who have already reviewed this film, the story line was poor, acting average and obviously wouldn't have happened if done by George Lucas. I've given it 4 due the special effects in IMax format and wonderful sound track that brings the film alive. Please,please, please let this be the end as I couldn't stand a miraculous resurrection of anyone of so called importance.",1
4396,8.0,"I've finished watching the new Star Wars movie; I enjoyed it! It's one of the better Star Wars movies, but not quite as good as Empire Strikes Back with Darth Vader and A New Hope, they are my favourite and had a slightly more compelling narrative.",1
4397,10.0,"No spoilers below.<br /><br />To everyone who is in doubt if this episode worth to be seen and has heard this and that, I would like to say that my whole family and our friends went to see the premiere and all of us were extremely satisfied. We were impressed by the continuous but dynamic plot development throughout the movie, the actors' quality play, the visual effects and the whole creation as a whole. I can easily say that this is probably one of the best episodes by now. Since I have watched, for example, the last Indiana Jones and Die Hard episodes, which their producers tried to finish somehow, now I went to the cinema with a slightly skeptical attitude and without special expectations but I was really pleasantly surprised. I would recommend the movie to all fans of the series - it is a praiseworthy end of the saga!",1

4404,6.0,"The movie felt like it was written to appeal to hard-core fans rather than general viewers. Consequently, I was bit lost at times (getting annoyed by one sentence speech or quote) Alike the previous instalments of new trilogy, there were scene and plots burrowed from the originals. Animation and special-effects as well as scenery is spectacular (why no 3D available as per other instalments seemed odd?) I wonder how long the wait will be for next episode (Star Wars X)?",0

I grew up watching these movies and wasn't a big fan of the prequels but didn't bash them either. JJ Abrams does an awesome job and this trilogy ended on a high note. Haters gonna hate, they aren't real fans. Go see it! Hope the saga continues with a new story.",1

Of course this movie has an incredible amount of hype and anxiety of the fans, and that can easily cause misjudgement about the film. But, let's be true: it's just a BAD movie. The original trilogy had a great character complexity, and it's what made it so beloved. This movie is some kind of a video-game badly executed. No character development, just a straightforward (and in some moments dumb) story with no shiny moments. May our beloved franchise rest in peace now, because this is the second strike. And the third probably won't be a charm...",0
4410,8.0,"The film did its best with the mess that was left over from the last jedi. I liked the film, as it did try to please the die hard fans.

4412,6.0,"Trying so hard to not replicate the flabby but fascinating Last Jedi, the final Skywalker saga movie self-consciously cuts so much fat off their story that it goes too far and huge chunks of meat go with it. What you're left with is a sad shell of a thing. It functions tolerably, the cast are game and of course it's gorgeous but Rise is so bracingly linear and ludicrously choppy in the pacing that it feels like a bad cartoon. The characters keep stating aloud what the next objective is and it's built around the silliest and most wildly anomalous central plot conceit that it comes across like ropey fanfic. There's a big lesson to be learned from this risk-averse misfire - and not all of it is the fault of the creators alone - so here's hoping the upcoming vast web of live-action series takes it on board and brings a bit of magic back into that far, far away galaxy of yore.",0

The scenario is almost non existent. Character are seriously empty, There is nothing, nothing in this episode except explosions, space chases and huge starships getting destroyed old school way. Honestly the worst episode of all. NO SCENARIO. They basically haver killed the Star War franchise with this episode. If you compare it to the last episode of Lord of The rings, this final opus is a joke. I give it 4 start for the CGI and the visuals which are really great but otherwise it would get a 2.

I think the big trouble is people don't like to get deep the hearts of the characters, they kind of just want to keep seeing the same as the first trilogy. I think this new trilogy, and specially this movie, make us think, and show us the real struggle we have as humans and the power that is inside each one.",1

4419,10.0,Someone should someday write a sociological<br /><br />or psychological treatise on why the Star Wars<br /><br />films attracted so much immature rage among certain sections of the population.

4420,10.0,"The last instalment of the stars wars saga nlew me away giving it a conclusion to satisfy alm star wars fans. Too many people are quick to jump on the star wars bad movie campaign...firing digs at plot holes, characters and acting alike. The rise of skywalker sees my personal favourite character ""palpatine"" back to cause mayhem. With cameos from han solo and Luke Skywalker as a force ghost...even giving more air time to that wonderful golden droid c3po... lando is back in the hot seat ofnthe millennium falcon alongside chewie. The film is slightly rushed and could probably be 3 films rolled into ...but the action is literally non stop, climaxing with the ultimate battle between good and evil....you are left with the feeling that the saga has closure and all the loose ends have been tied.

It all started with Anakin and it should have ended with something with Anakin. I was hoping we would have seen at least a Force Ghost of Anakin along with all the other Jedi in this saga.. Luke, Lea, Obi-One, Anakin, Ben and Yoda.<br /><br />Instead we got the saga of the Palpatine family. (Underneath it all) I think adding Palp was a good idea in order to fix the disaster TLJ left.",0

Look at the film people, not what came before it or using it as a sum up of the sequel trilogy.<br /><br />I loved this film, it was so much fun to watch, I cried multiple times during it they got the emotional scenes absolutely spot on. So much was always happening (like with every Star Wars film) didn't feel rushed to me they always pack so much into every episode of the saga. Always love how it starts off with a bang straight away and then rarely slows down!<br /><br />The only negative was the repeated mind bridge connection between Rey and Ben got tedious after a while, and totally did not get that vibe at all between them for the end! It was kind of nice not having love interests between the main characters.<br /><br />Overall I'd totally recommend this, judge it for yourself, go in with an open mind to just enjoy the film. And don't read the reviews.",1
4431,9.0,Non stop action. Probably the most action packed star wars movie? A couple times I went huh? Usually it was because JJ abrams was trying to fix a plot hole from Last Jedi. Overall all this was my favorite star wars movie out of the newer ones.,1
4432,5.0,It is what it is. Could they have done better? Yes. The f-ed up with the 8th episode by choosing a trash director. I don't get why people say the narrative is absurd. It's a basic race to the epic catharsis. The end was fine. It made sense. It was the predictable end to a predictable story. It's a lot of eye candy with childish goofy stuff to sell toys to the mind controlled consumer populous. In space. That's what Star Wars always was.,0
4433,5.0,Better than episode 8. But too much information for a desperate attempt to save the previous episode. Revival scenes with old characters are great and emotional but other scenes ruin the movie.,1

Loved it and hoping to have Star wars content for rest of my days.",1
4443,10.0,This movie moved me to tears. I thought it was beautiful and a fitting end to the saga. The writing was actually quite brilliant and took its own form to tie together the inconsistencies of the two movies before it. I think it quite creatively succeeded.

It was all respected and made into one last epic film that gives the fans what it wants and wraps up all 6 original films nicely. The backstories are respected, the history is respected, the story from episodes 7 and 8 are wrapped up. This film is a masterpiece and JJ deserves a huge pat on the back! 10 out of 10.

4450,9.0,"The Last Jedi was a a bit of a mess in my opinion, but JJ Abrams has salvaged it and tied up the trilogy really well in this final movie. It had a good continuation, and you could certainly see the continuity from The Force Awakens and how this trilogy flowed from start to finish.",1
4451,9.0,"If you loved The Force Awakens and hated The Last Jedi, then you'll absolutely love and adore this film. JJ Abrams has perfectly steered the story line back to his own, and provided endings for virtually all plot threads. The visuals are undeniably beautiful, and the soundtrack is intense and thrilling. The acting has stepped up a gear. The comedy was toned down. Rose was sidelined, which was a relief, and the return of fan favourite characters doesn't feel forced. I understand people's objections, but there is no denying that is one of the best Star Wars films to date.",1
4452,6.0,The only good piece of story is where Rey finds the second wayfinder in the remains of Kylo's starship that she had almost burned (even though it had a good chance to be destroyed in the very first encounter). And the X-Wing that was on the bottom of the ocean.,1

4454,10.0,"I enjoy the star wars franchise but I do not consider myself a star wars geek or aficionado.I have very fond memories of waiting upwards of four hours in the cinema queue as an 11 year old to watch the first film in 1977. It was magical and so far removed from anything I had seen before, I loved it. The sequels and prequels have never given me the magic I got from 1977 but they were watchable and I enjoyed them for different reasons. The star wars additional stories were good and Rogue One was fantastic at bridging the gap between episode three and four. The Disney/JJ Abrams era brought some magic back, I loved Force Awakens because it took me back to the original characters from episode four. Last Jedi was a stop gap and was a little tedious but I knew another was coming so I tolerated it. When I arrived at the cinema for the final installment there was an array of characters from the movie in the foyer offering photographs for a donation to charity which was brilliant and got you in the mood. I watched the film , and thoroughly enjoyed it. It brought the magic back because there was lots of nods to the original film and I loved the troubled and conflicted portrayal of Kylo Ren, something Hayden Christianson could not pull off as Anakin. Rey was brilliant but Po and Finn seem to take a bit of a backseat in this one. It looked good, sounded good and I didn't feel CGI'd to death (unlike the Marvel films). Its the Star wars universe, nothing is real. It was a fitting end to the Skywalker story arc and i really do think JJ has signed it off with aplomb and respect to the original material. Well done, I went home thoroughly entertained and satisfied.",1
4455,9.0,"I will admit that I really wanted to like this to reinforce my theory that the self purported true Star Wars fans were just living up to the stereotypes. As alluded to although I respect the Star Wars body of work I think it has been a bit overrated. As such aside from the first three, from a time when movies were not so good, I have not been that impressed. To say this is the worst Star Wars which some contend in the comments is just silly. It was far better in my opinion than few and much better than a few more.",0
4456,3.0,"JJ Abrams had a chance to salvage the perceived mistakes of the previous title, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but this film felt like a rushed, confusing mess where nothing makes any sense, and we jump from one planet and instance to another in a desperate attempt to provide closure to the epic Skywalker saga. That attempt failed miserably, and I am one-hundred percent convinced that this episode will come to be almost universally reviled by the Star Wars fandom, exceeding even that of The Last Jedi. Everything we see unfold in The Rise of Skywalker completely undermines the sacrifices made by our beloved heroes like Luke Skywalker, and it renders Anakin Skywalker's original role as the Chosen One as meaningless. The narrative ending of the film (and that of the Skywalker family's saga) leaves one feeling like this trilogy should never even have happened in the first place.",0

I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it. This movie is for the fans by a fan. Thank you JJAbrams and Disney for coming through and closing out the saga with a film I will watch many more times. This is a fun, fast paced, light, dark and emotional film.

It was a train wreck of plot holes and political agendas surpassed only by Solo. Then Rise of Skywalker comes out and they have nothing but criticisms. ""Finn looks lost. The Emperor is back and we don't know how! We are confused."" Well, they were confused before the film came off and there's just no hope for them. The film isn't confusing when you understand that what it's mostly doing is ret-conning all the junk out of the Star Wars cannon that Rian Johnson pulled out of his backside to surprise us with a toaster when we wanted a hero?",0

4464,6.0,"It seems what JJ Abrams wanted to do with the film is make a full conclusion to the story George Lucas created back then with the original films. But seriously now... you can't expect to end a saga of 40 years with only one film. Maybe ""the rise of Skywalker"" is good enough to end this particular trilogy, I think it works better to end this trilogy. But not the whole saga because it already has an ending. This trilogy just doesn't fit well with the Skywalker story fans have come to known. If this trilogy was directed by George Lucas himself and the story happened right after ""return of the jedi"" it would have made more sense. Maybe if they went for the original script of the film called ""duel of the fates"" (see? Already ties well into the other films ;)). The actors did a great job and it is shown how they gained the love of the fans throughout the years but the characters feel a little down, like to much was added to them (rey), or their story arc weren't developed enough (finn). I am also disappointed about kylo ren's story, I feel it couldn't have been better if he stayed a villain and became more of a villain than he was before. I would have preferred to see that then bringing back palpatine to play the bad guy again, with not much explanation on how he is alive. And of course let's not forget the last scene where Rey decides to call herself ""Skywalker"". I mean really? She could have kept her true identity, be proud of herself and not what she could have become (palpatine's successor) and go on a quest to become a better person than her grandfather was. To try and help the galaxy and change the reputation of her family's name. Overall I don't know what I feel about this film, maybe if I watched it again I would know for sure.",1

I really wish that they should've had started building up his return from the beginning or at least give SOMETHING that would make sense of him coming back! Just for the sake of creating a ""gasp factor"", they decided to bring palpatine back. In addition to that, they completely ruined the character of Poe. I mean that guy was such a witty and a fun character and they literally annihilated him.

I definitely expected more from Star Wars but it seems things have gone down the drain after all that. How could they even make Palpatine merciful like a classic Bond villain from the 60's is beyond me. I say merciful because he could have easily finish them off. Isn't the dark side all about power and fear of loss of power, well the threat is before you and begging to be finished off, yet.... I can only say that: Palpatine the Merciful.<br /><br />So as a movie i rate it a 6, but the plot eff me it must be a 2 at best.",1

Kidnapping was predictable but the choppy nature of the first 50 minutes shows how uninteresting this story appears to be. Then Zorii was beyond lame, ""I like you REY.""

I am thankful for the bad reviews because having my expectations lowered even further made the film even more enjoyable. The ending was perfect.

4523,5.0,"Coming from someone who is a huge Star Wars fan and has been waiting for this film to come out for the last year now, (as many of us have) I must say, I was disappointed with this film. It wasn't fantastic nor horrible, but for being the last movie of the sequel trilogy and the end of the Skywalker Saga (apparently), it was not what it was lead up to be. The whole movie was scattered, and we basically watched the characters run around for 2 hours. The dialogue was cheesy and forced, which was sad considering Daisy, Oscar, and John are all good actors but were given a poor script. And the plot of Palpatine coming back? Did he or did he not die in Return of the Jedi more than a decade ago? It made no sense. And why, why did they have to make him the grandfather of Rey? The whole plot of Rey's character was ruined from that. She was supposed to be shown as someone who came from nothing, but still could be something, which apparently JJ wanted to take out for some apparent reason. This plot was not needed and realistically, they could've done much better, but decided to take fans' extreme theories and put them into play for 2 hours and 35 minutes. And what the heck was the deal with Hux? Played a somewhat major part in TLJ, and suddenly becomes a spy in TROS and gets killed off two seconds after we find out? What the heck! Also, what happened to the relationship between Finn and Rose? Did I not see a kiss or relationship in TLJ? They literally just threw that down the drain. They might as well have taken Rose's character out of this movie; she didn't serve any purpose. Finn and Poe's character? Not funny, not what they were in the last two movies. And how did Rey suddenly know how to heal people with the force and beat Palpatine, a sith lord, with two lightsabers, by HERSELF? It just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />And what were the point of the new characters in this movie? They served no purpose whatsoever. The random bring-back of Han Solo even though he was never a Jedi and couldn't be a force ghost but somehow was some sort of ""memory""/ghost Kylo had. That scene was a reincarnated version of the one in TFA, but the complete opposite.<br /><br />Kylo Ren's redemption was forced and way too fast, considering all it took was seeing his father and Han saying the same thing he said before. And why did Kylo have to just chase Rey around the whole time? As much as I love their relationship, that's all he did in this movie, which is sad considering he's one of the best characters, in my opinion, better than Rey.<br /><br />Oh, and C3PO also shuts down, but suddenly comes back to life from R2 just messing with his wires.<br /><br />The ending of this movie was the icing on the cake for me. I thought ""Oh Rey and Kylo will definitely come back and beat good ol' Palps together and everything will be all good, etc"", but unfortunately, that was NOT the case. Instead, Rey, (somehow) defeats Palpatine with I guess just the force? And then dies, Kylo comes on the scene and puts his life into her through the force,(which I predicted as a possibility because hey, it's our soft Ben) Kisses her, and dies. Yes, I was happy they finally kissed. Was I happy our redeemed Ben died RIGHT AFTER we finally officially got Reylo? No. Yes, This may have been a prediction that this would happen and one of them would die saving the other, but the fact that the scene just cuts off after that and we get no closure of Ben is kind of sad. Not kind of, it's just depressing. Kylo ren was an amazing character and the fact that he finally was redeemed and then killed with no closure was really sad.<br /><br />And what happened with Kylo and Rey's relationship? We got all that romantic tension in TLJ and in this movie we got fighting until the last 10 seconds they had together, and then Ben died. Yes I knew they would fight, but I thought we'd at least get one good, emotional force bond scene.<br /><br />Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Worth the watch? Yes, I would say it was, because even though it definitely didn't have the potential the last two films had, we all are going to see it anyway. It's the last film, for crying out loud. TROS might not have been fantastic or horrible, but it was okay/good. I was definitely disappointed considering JJ did such an amazing job with TFA, and then decided to completely twist this one, and not in a good way. He incorporated too much of the past in this film, whereas in TFA he incorporated just enough of the old with the new to make it fit. Do I still love the franchise? Yes of course! Just because we get a bad SW film doesn't mean I hate it all now, though some people tend to do that. Star Wars will forever be my favorite franchise/series, even though this last movie wasn't that good, I can live with it. We got TFA, we got TLJ, and we got TROS. Concluding this review, I would say to go watch it for yourself and see. But personally, I was disappointed with the turnout, but I can live with it. It was neither horrible nor fantastic, just okay/good. Interested to see what Disney/Lucasfilm does next with this adventure of a franchise.",0

4528,1.0,"This movie is a real mess. Rian Johnson left a lot of possibilities for developing the story in many different and interesting directions and I hoped thanks to that we would not get another OT rehash. How stupid I was... Abrams and Terrio created a heartless movie which consists mostly of cheap fan service. The characters do not advance in their development and the plot is completely uninvolving with lots of holes and out of the blue sort of twists. I have a feeling that most scenes here were written just for merch. The same can be said about the new characters who are just useless from the plot perspective. This film is everything that SW are not and it's a pity we got another MCU superhero like movie instead of something more insightful and thought-provoking like ""The Last Jedi"". The action speeds and goes so fast you don't have time to think about what you see, the editing is just horrible...who the hell cut this movie..., the cast do not even pretend they are doing their best and what's more ""The Rise of Skywalker"" tries to recton ""TLJ"" so hard that it's just a pain to watch it. I wish this movie had never been made, it's just a joke and should be treated this way. It destroys prequels and original trilogy, but also flushes the new canon in the toilet. I do not envy LF story group...after this ""masterpiece"" they will have to patch the lore and it won't be easy...I think it's justified to refer to Abrams as Jar Jar from now on. For all this mess he has made... The only positive aspect of the movie is Adam Driver who does incredible things on screen being given maximum five lines of the text throughout the movie. Although his character could have been written much better, the actor seems to be the one who cares. The rest...just to forget, bury deep down under the ground and pretend it had never existed.",0
4529,6.0,"TROS felt more like a movie that was made for the soul purpose of wrapping things up. It obviousiouly fallows the plotline of ROTJ, but then again, so did the sequel movies in general fallowed the plotlines of the originals. Heck, even the Emperor says a variation of the same lines he had in ROTJ. I think where the sequels fell short was the changing of directors in TLJ. You can tell where Abrams had to shoehorn changes from that movie. There is a big reveal that I liked, other than that, it is an average SW movie, even then I think that is being generious.",0

I loved the choices they made for the story. It's hands down my favorite Star Wars film. It's also my favorite film of all time as of now. I can't believe JJ Abrams pulled this one off. He made such a great film. It works even as a standalone film because you don't need to see 7-8 to understand this film. I didn't like 7-8 but 9 made me appreciate the Sequel Trilogy in a whole new light. I can't wait to watch the entire Saga one day 1-9 back to back.

4537,8.0,"Having seen all 9 movies. I can say safely that the latest entry understands Star Wars.<br /><br />The last Jedi was a poor attempt. Cliché's aplenty, bumbling characters, 40<br /><br />minutes of merchandising, bad guy that were comical and unbelievable and the story telling was simply lazy.<br /><br />This episode was flawed mostly in trying to fit too much in too little time but equally by having to fix the damage done by the TlJ. It really needed an extra 20 minutes or so to link scenes and to plug a few plot holes. But I have to give credit where credit isdue. The characters have been given licence to act in this episode. Fin actually progresses forward from being a stormtrooper, not backwards into a farcical Jarjar binks replacement. Poe acts like a military commander/ maverick not a standup comedian. Rey stopped being an over zealous 20 something and actually portrayed the strong female and main character role well.<br /><br />We get to see the old characters mix well with the new characters and see them respected.<br /><br />Yes this movie plays homage to the old movies and does it relatively well. But here's where it really get things right. The bad guys are evil. The movie knows it's a star wars and not a marvel comic book knockoff. The character arcs are completed. Its entertaining, without being annoying. Yes it knows star wars has a history and you can't fool life time fans by not understanding how things work.<br /><br />Go into this movie knowing its has its problems you'll enjoy it more. This is probably fourth of fifth best Starwars depending if you rank it with Rogue one and Solo.<br /><br />Ps<br /><br />There is no Mary Poppins moments in this.",0

4542,6.0,"The time has finally come, the concluding movie to the 9 part skywalker saga that has spanned over 40 years has come out, and it's mainly a hit with some misses. The Rise of Skywalker kicks off around a year after Rian Johnson's The last Jedi and we are immediately thrown into the action, which is unfortunately where this movie has its flaws. J.J Abrams has so much to catch us up on almost as if the last movie never even happened therefore for the first act - second act we as an audience are constantly moving around from action to action just to get up to speed on everything that is happening in the world, almost to a point were it is all overwhelming not giving us enough time to take it all in a have a breather. But where the movie really kicks off is the last act, J.J and co screenwriter Chris Terrio really bring in all the Star wars nostalgia they can as well as some impressive action set pieces to effectively conclude this saga to a satisfying ending. Performances all around were great especially when Kylo Ren and Rey were on screen together. Another favorite of mine was definitely Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, as he also got a lot of enjoyable screen time. Overall while there are some flaws with the plot and overall first half of the movie, the things that we have grown to love about star Wars - the X-wing dogfights, the lightsaber duels, the camaraderie. Are what really bring us back and show us why we all love Star Wars.",1

4545,,"The rise of skywalker is a very risking Star Wars movie in many ways, it has to clean up the mess that the last Jedi made, it has to end the skywalker saga, and it has to end the sequel trilogy and in my opinion the rise of skywalker does all that. Is this a prefect movie no not at all but it's a great Star Wars movie and a great ending to one of the most to skywalker saga and to the sequel trilogy. The cast is all great and all of then deliver great performances Especially Daisy Ridley As Rey and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, they both give amazing performances as there characters. The music is once again fantastic. The movie is also really well shot. The action scenes are all great and well made. The only problem I have with this movie is the first 20 to 30 minutes is very sloppy and all over the place but after that the movie takes off and doesn't stop till the credits roll. Overall, the rise of skywalker does the impossible and ends the skywalker saga in the best way, if your a fan of Star Wars go see this movie and support it.",1

4554,,"One cannot talk about Rise of Skywalker without talking about the two films that preceded it. Unlike the old trilogy, the new trilogy did not have the benefit of starting out with a firm foundation. While there are some people that have argued that the Force Awakens was decent and Last Jedi was the film where the cracks started to show, I don't subscribe to this view. Force Awakens was the film that laid the foundation for the rest of the trilogy, with characters with almost no background (such as Rey and Finn), crazy and unbelievable coincidences (the Millennium Falcon conveniently appearing when Rey and Finn are in danger), and the so-called ""failed"" Luke character (as Han Solo said: ""Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything""). Although Rian Johnson, I suppose, was not obligated to follow what Force Awakes set up (example: he could have ignored Han Solo's dialogue and ascribed Luke's disappearance to him needing to reassess and revise the Jedi teachings; he could still have thrown away the lightsaber but said something like ""weapons of war are useless if your heart is not in the right place""), Force Awakens did set it up, and Rian Johnson did what he could with what was given to him. Moreover, with regards to the scene that shows Luke contemplating killing his nephew, that is already is being retconned in the comic books that a dark storm (possibly Palpatine) was in that room causing Luke to draw his lightsaber and maybe Rian Johnson, had he directed the third film, would have provided this explanation. Therefore, yes I guess I'm arguing that Last Jedi is a better movie than Force Awakens (not that Last Jedi is perfect by any means).",0

George Lucas must have been too enthralled with his original concept of the nine movies to be able to see what was happening. So, we're left with three classics and six duds. This last one is a sad ending to what was once a great story.",0
4561,7.0,"I dont think it was perfect. There was definitely some parts that felt predictable. And some scenes that I felt could have had more of an emotional punch. Like, they make this choice to wipe C3PO's mind, but then like 10 min later, he is being given his memory back. And so it kind of makes it feel like that scene was kind of pointless. And certainly, I felt like Keri Russell was kind of wasted. I get they wanted to provide Poe a little more backstory, and they needed to have the whole ""All hope isnt lost, when you need it, people will come"" moment. But like, I dont know...it kind of just felt like filler. But overall, I did like this film. And I did like it better than Last Jedi (not that I hated that film). I just found a lot of the side quest stuff in Last Jedi to feel kind of pointless and it made it feel like 3 different films were happening. This one felt more concise. And I liked the message about how you're not destined to be bad. Its about the choices you make, and you can always change. Finn and Jannah are stormtroopers who gave up the life. Rey is a Palpatine and but chooses to be a Skywalker. And obviously Kylo Ren seeing the humanity in Rey and then having a talk with the memory of his father realizes its not too late, and literally throws away his lightsaber. Kylo Ren is dead, and Ben Solo is reborn. Plus, Im very much Reylo trash so I very much liked their storyline and connection (throughout all 3 films). And I am happy that they finalled kissed....even though he died right after. I did think it was a nice and satisfying ending to this saga. Not as good as how Endgame ended their saga...but still good overall.",1
4562,5.0,"Rise of Skywalker's is an improvement from the last dumpster fire I guess, so I'm trying to be nice here with my rating. But this movie only seemed to prove that Disney had absolutely no sense of direction with this trilogy, which is inexcusable to me. Like what the hell?!? Bringing back Palpatine felt desperate and not adequately explained. His death in Return of the Jedi was the redeeming act of Anakin Skywalker's story arc. Why diminish the significance in any way the actions of one of the greatest characters of all time? I find these little details frustrating because Star Wars has so much potential when it comes to storytelling. There's no excuse for this!",0

It was Anakin who defeated Palpatine and brought back balance to the Force. There was absolutely no need to retell this story.<br /><br />Im not sure if it's all JJ Abrams' fault, but he isnt exactly known for inventing new stories... Its worth remembering that Star Trek Into Darkness was in large part a rip-off of The Wrath of Khan.<br /><br />The saddest thing about all of this is that this project had potential. It had great actors playing interesting (as of TFA) chacarters, the story could be done into something truly great.<br /><br />Instead it was made into a poinless rubbish.<br /><br />I still think the actors did an amazing job with their characters - I especially love Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac.",0
4569,6.0,"First off, is by no means a bad  film, sure it's flawed mostly from a story point of view, which is where most fans attack this film. Despite some inconsistencies within the framework of the story's saga, I recall some unexplained elements from the first trilogy and none of these fans are nitpicking like they do with these films, purely because most of them saw them when they were kids/teenagers and were so enthralled by them that they omit some of these ""flaws"". My point is that it is almost as if they want to hate the sequel trilogy for whatever reason, minutiously ripping every small detail to shreds without giving it the slightest chance. The 1, 2 or 3 star ratings are absolutely disgraceful, as they only increase the poor conception this trilogy has without actually being deserving of such shaming.<br /><br />These whiny fans seem like they want to have everything served in a silver platter, asking for huge send-offs with big pompous displays to major characters but it is not always the case to do that, nor it should be. This film already gives much fan-service so as to please every generation but it is still impossible to satisfy every single viewer.",0

4595,6.0,"Many say this ruins the franchise, but I think the franchise was already ruined. Therefore, I choose to review this film based on my personal enjoyment and the elements of how it functions as a film. The opening scene had me hooked with Palpatine's plan being introduced. The film also had some interesting concepts that kept me engaged. Things like the force-connect fight scene and Rey's visions are really great. However, the story itself is not great. Most of it is characters looking for a MacGuffin that ends up being destroyed is the whole story. Also, it is predictable as given that this is the end of the new trilogy, you know the heroes will prevail. There was some mild fan service that worked at times but also failed at others. The final battle, besides space horses, was really good and entertaining. I thought Palpatine's demise was stupid and the scene where Kylo revives Rey and they kiss ruined their whole journey. It made little sense and reaffirmed the notion that Rey is a Mary Sue. The ending was decent, but should not have had Rey say ""Skywalker"" Granted, I like the last shot. Overall, some fight scenes, characters, locations, and a great emotional scene with Han Solo make the film worthwhile. There is way too much humor and the story is not great, but I did have an overall good time with the movie. As far as the 11 Star Wars films go, this would rank at 9th or 8th for me, but I really like most Star Wars films. Overall, you will probably not like it much, but there are some good elements that make me glad I finished the saga. Now all we need is a Yoda movie.",1

It is very clear that these movies were made by two directors who had completely different visions of what the movies should be, or Abrams just didn't have a lot of control over the movie and had to satisfy some committee when doing the movie. Oh and my god if Finn isn't one of the most irritating characters of the decade or so, i'm not sure if it's the way he was written or John Boyega's delivery, but every time he appeared on the screen i wanted to punch him.

You can tell a story was set up in episode 7, and that episode clearly had a path, and episode 8 rewrote the path, and now we have what we have. The sequel trilogy could have been a remarkable adventure, with out old trio of heroes alongside the new, but it never does this. It just felt like another generic visual blockbuster, with no heart, no soul, no imagination, and no respect for its fanbase.",0
4611,10.0,Ignore the silly 1/10 that's just upset marvel fans. This is seriously amazing. It's different and ticks all the star wars boxes.,1
4612,1.0,One of the worst films I have ever watched.Bad characters are there just to be in the movie and for fan eyes.Good guys win no matter what...,0
4613,1.0,"Not great. Best of the bad lot but still a big let down. Practically stole the final battle from return of the Jedi, lines and all. Waste of time and money, sad to see Disney destroy the franchise",0
4614,10.0,"The elite clearly do not like this movie. I just returned seeing this with my sister who introduced this movie to me when I was a kid in the 80s. It had all of the nostalgia of the original trilogy. John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver put on spectacular performances. I was incredibly impressed with how much John Boyega has developed Finn from the scared stormtrooper to leader of the Resistance. This was a major correction from The Last Jedi and I give major props to Disney, JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy for fixing the mistake that was Rian Johnson. I won't include spoilers but everyone in the movie theater cheered at the surprise appearances!",1
4615,9.0,"So I've now watched it. What's my verdict? Well no spoilers but suffice to say this is an absolutely superb end to an incredible sci fi saga. Filmmaking of the highest order. The pace never flags. The effects and action are spectacular. But what roots it is the exceptional performances of Daisy Ridley as Rey and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. They are both fantastic here. Ridley, in particular, really comes of age. Physically she is incredible but the conflict and torment within her are superbly portrayed. There is so much in it it deserves a second viewing and I will certainly be returning. The Force is Strong with this one...👍",1

4617,10.0,"My honest score would be a 7.5. I loved it. It was ao much better than The Last Jedi. Not at all a perfect film but definitely a perfect "" Star Wars "" film. It was really enjoyable and nostalgic. I teared up a few times. Definitely not worth the hate.",1

It was like a videogame they made into a movie very different but loved it, not perfect there's flaws but in whole I love it!

4621,3.0,"I'm not sure what to make of This. On one hand it covers all the themes and ideas of all the preceding films and expands on a few. It completes the circle in terms of story arc. There is a lot of action and details which give more than a fleeting nod to the past. However it pushes the limits of what the audience should be expected to accept based on what they already know about this story universe. I know this is science fiction, I know there is an element of belief required when it comes to the force and the characters capabilities with it. There are far to many times I found myself thinking "" but what about ? "". The producers are so desperate to get to the end and rap it neatly up in a bow so they can put it to bed that it jars at many points and many different levels. I came away from the the cinema with one phrase rolling round my head repeatedly, "" Jumped the shark ! "". I understand Disney need to make money from this especially after the amount the franchise cost them but please give us a break for at least a decade from any more films you have reached saturation point, know when to stop and draw breath.",1

4623,8.0,"Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker- Be open minded and stop being a bunch of bias emotional teenage anakins and fricken realise all the changes the movies have been through since 1977. If you know the history of Star Wars you'll know they haven't had the cleanest of runs in terms of production and franchise owners. But at the end of the day this was the final chapter in regards to all 9 films. I think they did a pretty good job, it's not perfect but you better start praising that J.J Abrams was the one to finish the series and not Rian Johnson. Star Wars isn't dead. How they choose to take it from hear is the exciting bit. Who knows what they have in store for all the fans but in regards to the prequels and sequels this was the final film. Hate it or love it. But for all the negative comments out there. ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."" No matter how OP Palpitine was the dark side always loses. So to all you haters lighten up give the film some respect and stop being a bunch of bloody losers, thanks 👍🏽.",1

4627,8.0,"As The Force Awakens had many elements of A New Hope, The Rise of Skywalker echoed Return of the Jedi in many elements, right down to the Ewoks making a cameo - Emperor Papatine returns and is revealed to have been to have been behind everything in the sequels (a much bigger surprise than when it was revealed in the Prequels) - Palpatine just oozes evil and remains one if my favorite Star Wars characters, the ending confrontation between him, Rey and Kilo was very reminiscent of the confrontation between Vader, Luke and Palpatine in Jedi - things are switched around enough not to make it a complete rip off but in the end Kylo(Darth) dies saving Rey(Luke), Palpatine becomes a victim of his own arrogance (again) and dies (again) and and having succeeded in turning Kylo(Darth) back to the light side of the Force, Rey (Luke) survives to continue the Jedi and Skywalker legacy, so yeah pretty similar although Darth and Luke didn't kiss in the end like Kylo and Rey.<br /><br />Another similarity between the two movies - Rey's mentors - Luke & Leia - failed to mention that Palpatine was her Grandfather the same way Obi-Wan & Yoda failed to mention to Luke that Darth Vader was his Father, seems like something you might want to mention to a person.",0
4628,7.0,"No spoilers, just opinion. This is not the worst Star Wars film, but it's one that reveals so many weaknesses, as it does it strengths. That it's the 9th movie in a very flawed franchise says much of the passion of fans and the film makers. No, it's not a cash grab, but a labour of love from all those involved. Perhaps too much love, as what is jettisoned is good story writing (for a plot that unravels the moment you begin thinking about it), a decent script and that sense of wonder from the first trilogy. What we get is an apologetic love-letter to the series, which is great on some levels, disappointing on others. Could this have been better? Given a year of re-writes and less sentiment, yes. So much better. Would that have made a Star Wars film? No. Star Wars is a sentimental series, full of flaws. It's the ending it deserved. The first film could've so easily failed. It didn't deserve Empire which is one of the finest SF films made. Return of the Jedi was a fitting sequel. And so is this. Rejoice that its ended, and not so badly. And that Phantom Menace wasnt the swan-song we could so easily have had.",0

First of all, get a grip, second of all you in no way speak for me or all of my friends, family and co-workers. Everyone I know has thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy. I've been around since the very start, yes i was old enough to see a new hope in cinemas. The first trilogy was iconic, the jar jar trilogy was below par, with the exception of revenge of the sith which just about poked it's head above water. I loved this last trilogy, it was great. To see Rey and Ben's story arc round to a conclusion was satisfying and the special effects were outstanding. If you want to go see macbeth or literary works of genius, get yourself off to the theater or the ballet for a spot of swan lake. Then take out your quill and spout forth your wise words on parchment.

4633,7.0,"I am so confused by all these bad reviews, if you enjoyed The Force Awakens then you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />If you thought The Last Jedi was a mistake then don't worry because JJ fixes up all the loose ends.<br /><br />I have read reviews complaining about it being too emotive? And having too much action/adventure? I mean what do you want from a movie? Ask yourself why you are interested in watching a Star Wars movie, because if it's to see lightsaber duels, good vs. evil or Jedi vs. Sith (which I might add Ryan tried to terminate..), a few well tied in comedic moments (watch the originals - are they dry and serious throughout like The Last Jedi? No) and a couple of twists that pay homage to the original trilogy then you should really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I will add that there is a lot of storytelling happening in this film which some people don't seem to like - but given the train wreck JJ was cleaning up he did a brilliant job. I imagine this trilogy would have been quite polished if they just stuck with the one director throughout.<br /><br />I also don't think a true Lucas fan will ever be satisfied with this trilogy, but at the same time look at all of you who hated the prequels which was Lucas' vision and it is his story to tell...<br /><br />All I can say is when I walked out of The Last Jedi I was confused and a little wtf just happened, it made no sense to the story set up in The Force Awakens. After The Rise of Skywalker I walked out satisfied and felt that it tied in well with The Force Awakens.",1

4639,,Where do I write my review? Can somebody post my review on the website that says that the Star Wars movie-the one in theatres right now-was ok?,0
4640,5.0,"This is NOT a Star Wars movie. This feels more like an Abrahm's Star Trek movie. A space opera is meant to be about relatable characters with epic story arcs. This is purely a gorging of visual effects. As a casual Star Wars enthusiast, this trilogy is stained with Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrahm's lack of vision and extreme identity politics. This trilogy ultimately undermined everything the original characters achieved and broke a lot of the canon of the original 6 films, plus made a total mockery of the force. This is before I even get to the story!<br /><br />The acting was mostly excellent. Daniels seemed off his game at 3PO and Billy D WIlliams was a former shadow of himself. Otherwise, everyone performed well. It was great to see Kylo Ren was no longer a ""man baby"" and Abrahms permitted him be a realistic character (showing Abrahms's extreme identity politics were softened somewhat). However, this is the extent of the likeability of the characters. I felt no attachment to any of the characters and by the end, I didn't care who died (save Kylo Ren).<br /><br />When Lucas created the original trilogy, his focus was on Epic heroes gradually being built from the ground up. Abrahms dropped the ball by making Ray a Mary Sue from the beginning of TFA. Abrahms watered that farcical OPness in this film as Rey actually had some challenges and even failed! However, her OP ability to easily throw huge objects (FAR beyond Yoda's 900 years worth of skills) and Rey could fly through the air. This was a total farce and it butchered the essence of the force. The force has become a total joke.<br /><br />The film is visually stunning. The story is paper thin. Most of the characters were props. The film is filled with McGuffins. The supposed ""fan service"" shows Abrahms really doesn't understand Star Wars, or the message from the fans. I suggest this mediocrity is enough to finish off Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrahms careers. I used to hold Kennedy in very high regard.<br /><br />I was not a fan of TFA. I didn't make it through TLJ (I tried twice). This film was easily better than TFA and TLJ. However, this wasn't Star Wars. Instead of mythical heroes being built, this was Kennedy and Abrahms worshiping at the temple of identity politics. This trilogy will be rejected by most fans as non-canon, especially as all past heroes were destroyed, save Leia. It will not stand the test of time.<br /><br />Also, the film just didn't give the audience time to breathe. The first third was enjoyable (as Abrahms needed to tell story rather than push politics). The second third was ok, except for the ridiculous power ranger character. The last third was quite painful to watch.<br /><br />These characters were not from a place far far away. The characters were taken directly from the official check list of the US identity politics bible. When you saw Lando and Finn next to each other, this really hit home. Lando was truly beyond this earth and loveable. Finn was just your typical African American dude, a dime a dozen. Rose Tico was even worse. She was truly a prop.<br /><br />3/10 For visual effects plus a bonus 2/10 because Abrahms had to work so hard to undo Rian Johnson's disaster. This is, in my opinion, the best of the Disney Star Wars trilogy. It's a huge mess.",0
4641,8.0,"The split in Star Wars fandom won't heal as a result of this final episode of the nine movie series. That goal would be beyond the skill level of any director in history.

4647,6.0,This movie contains many cliche and unoriginal elements that feel exhausting along with somehow allowing the movie to feel silly and cartoony even for a fantasy movie. The chemistry between Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver carries the movie and is by far the high point. The finale doesn't seem as climactic as it seems rushed.,0
4648,7.0,"Great action, visually stunning as expected. I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews saying Disney ruined Star Wars but this trilogy is waaay better than the last reboot. The best thing that came from the last trilogy was pod racing and a dual lightsaber. As a Star Wars fan a few parts of the film did make me question the plot a bit but it eventually comes together nicely. Ignore the reviews, everyone seems to believe that their sensitivity will somehow change the plot? Boo Hoo. The movie has been made, get over it, Disney and JJ made a very good trilogy.",1

I was hellbent on not going to this movie as I was sure it would be a disaster. Then reviews started coming in and not at all flattering. I was not going to go...but at the last damn minute I changed my mind and bought a ticket.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did!!! Some huge questions were answered and loose ends tied up. I still don't like how Disney did the 2 previous movies.<br /><br />Some scenes or things within this movie I didn't agree with but overall I really liked this movie!!!<br /><br />Perhaps at times, it may have been to fast paced. I sure would like to be able to rewind a few scenes and watch it over again. Just to understand what just happened.<br /><br />I know it's hard to bash the first 2 movies in this series and like the 3rd...it makes no sense. But it is what it is. I really enjoyed this last movie and quite honestly, if this is the last, I'm gonna miss it now. My childhood is now complete. (I'm still not growing up)",1

I thought all the characters were well balanced.<br /><br />It will be ever so difficult to emulate what A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back did. Ground breaking films in a different time.

If you are going to the cinema looking for an academy best picture contender or masterpiece of storytelling ala Scorsese then you have no business writing a review of this movie, it's a hugely entertaining popcorn spectacle, a complete blast from start to finish, and I loved it just as much as I've loved previous movies in the saga, what I'm trying to say is if you watched these movies as a kid and were in absolute awe of what you saw on screen then this movie won't disappoint you at all, go see it and make up your own mind, it's not perfect, but it's Star Wars as you know and love !!",1

I don't approach them from the standpoint of a critic; I am entirely inclined to go with it, enjoy the spectacle, eat my popcorn, and feel good. I could not take that path this time. TROS is almost as bad as The Phantom Menace. Compelling plot lines from the last film were just abandoned, various plot elements in this film made little sense, the dialogue was stilted, and the performances were simply not as good.

So there's two stars! Then the performances put in by the cast? Everyone gave 110% whether you enjoyed it or not! So there's 3 stars which are pretty much a given!

4690,5.0,"Ruined an amazing saga. This film was written by about 12 people and I could tell before I even looked it up. This was not made with love or care or with honour for the other films. Just like the force awakens there were no new ideas, all very boring and not much happened. Shots and scenes were mimicked from the other films in some cases such as the revenge of the sith, return of the Jedi. Threw out all the work done by the last Jedi, which was flawed but was original, BOLD, clever and introduced new characters like rose and the code breaker. This film pretended as if the last one never happened. No creativity. I can now honestly say I hate Disney. Turned Star Wars into a money making machine with no love or care. J.J.Abrams is an idiot with no care for the franchise. Terrible story, all over the place. No character stories, a very big and missed opportunity. This could have been brilliant. They should of gotten Gareth Edwards or the director of the last Jedi to have written and directed this AlONE. Very disappointed, just, so angry.",0
4691,8.0,"All I hear is how Disney have done this and that...... Well in my opinion the only bad thing to have gapped since Disney bought it, is The Last Jedi. This film however is a good movie.<br /><br />It's starts off cramming a lot of story in... Could this have been what Episode 8 should have been about???<br /><br />I will not spoil the movie, but we have plenty of action and my boys ( including me) loved it. Plenty of nods to older movies while the action keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement. Rey and Kylos story's are developt and both add alot to the movie.

4697,10.0,"I went in with an open mind and mentally prepared for anything, but was immediately sucked in and felt like a kid again like when I was watching the prequel trilogy in theaters. It's a very fun, very dark, very exciting, visually stunning, Star Wars film... through and through. JJ again brought the essence of Star Wars back to the screen in a big way. The film, of course, as with ANY Star Wars film, is certainly not without it's faults; the pacing in the first half is lightning fast but I think that was due to not having any story before it to go on and having to cram a lot of story into one film. The ""fan service"" was perhaps a little too much at times and a bit cringe, but at the same time kinda made me feel good and is really what Hollywood cinema is about. All in all I thought it was great and a worthy ending to the saga! 💜 May the force be with you all!",1

There are plenty of surprises in the movie, all of which I didn't see coming and loved - one in particular. I also cried a lot, sometimes from the story and other times from the significance of moments. It has a lot of action, beautiful scenes/cinematography, well-done expansion of the SW world without it seeming out of place (like the casino scenes in episode 8), and most importantly good character closure (Adam Driver in particular really stands out). The ending I found very touching. The only criticism is that I would like to have seen the characters interact more, but I also feel that way about episodes 4-6.",1
4702,6.0,The whole entire 40 years of the Skywalker saga ends. When I seen this the audience were gasping together at scenes that were to terrible to watch.

4705,9.0,"I don't know why people ripped on this movie so much. What were people expecting to happen? For me this movie captures what star wars is really about. Watching a small group of heroes beat the enormous odds against them and discover more about themselves as individuals and grow closer to each other as a group. Abrams himself said that whatever decision he made as a director, whether that be plot, music, cinematography, or script, people were either going to love it or hate it. I have a lot of respect for Abrams as a director because I don't think he cares whether people loved it or didn't. He knew he couldn't please everyone and so he directed the movie in a way he saw fit and I think he did a great job. The character development is strong, the acting is much better in this movie, and I thought the plot was great. It kept me in the edge of my seat throughout the movie.<br /><br />I thought this movie had all the elements of a quality movie from a film standpoint and from a starwars standpoint. Its really disappointing to see so much criticism for the finale of a movie series that people fell in love with.",1

I totally understood the stick those films got - Jaja/too much CGI etc - but I still enjoyed them a lot and what they did do was provide a continuation of the great story telling whilst adding new and exciting elements to the wonderful 'world' of Star Wars without damaging any of the fundamentals laid out before them. I was still a massive fan right up to the point The Force Awakens was released. The Star Wars saga ends for me when George Lucas sold it to Disney (whilst I have found Rogue one and The Mandolorian fairly entertaining).",1
4712,9.0,"Born in 1976, the first film I remember seeing at the cinema was 'Return of the Jedi'. I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. I'm just home from seeing episode ix and I really enjoyed it. I laughed, I cried. I loved seeing the old characters mixed with the new. Yes, I still don't really like Rey and I've always felt that Adam Driver was the wrong casting decision, but it wasn't enough to put me off.<br /><br />I don't really understand the negative reviews. Star Wars was never a high brow Sci-Fi. It was a film that was targeted at kids and adults alike. No actors are going to match the ones that made up the original trilogy, particularly Fisher and Ford. But hell, it was an enjoyable ride.",1
4713,2.0,"That this movie was nominated for anything let alone some Oscars, that must have been an expensive title to get on the ballot. I feel like I missed something the first time I watched this movie and felt like I should watch it again, but alas, I decided sleeping would be a better, more entertaining use of my time. Thank you to everyone who helped destroy the Star Wars universe. I'm not even a hard core fan, I didn't really notice any plot gaps, inconsistencies or the like, I can just say that I really enjoy a good action sci-fi movie. But this? This was bad all around. Bad acting, bad story, terrible cheesy effects and not an ounce of tension or a moment of surprise. Seems like it was slapped together at a moment's notice like any other Transformers movie but it's not. It's a multi generation clash of good versus evil where nothing was guaranteed. I am very sorry everyone, I feel guilty because it's partly my fault. I paid to see this garbage, I supported it. Never again.",0
4714,8.0,"This Film had a very difficult task coming in: wrapping up 42 years of storylines in less than two and a half hours. On top of losing Carrie Fisher, who was most likely to play an even larger role in the film than she did using archived footage.",0
4715,1.0,"Movie was so awful you start to cheer for the bad guys to destroy all the planets to ensure Disney stops making this nonsense.

Like, what happened? They were good in the last two but here they're barely even trying. The movie has good visuals an the music's alright too. And the storywriters were not even imaginative - like bringing back Palpatine. Couldn't you guys think of a new villain? All-in-all, it's just mediocre. Just watch it to end the series.",0
4727,10.0,I met Star Wars in 2002<br /><br />Started watching Phantom Menace first,0
4728,8.0,"I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life. Say what you want about the sequels and prequels, you and I can have an opinion. I grew up with the originals not watching the prequels until after they came out. I loved 1 to 6. When I found out they were making 7, 8 and 9, I was very excited. 7 and 8 were great, 7 being better than 8 and it was a long two year wait for 9. Now, I did go in with low expectations, I read a leak on the internet weeks ago which actually turned out to be accurate, and written down it sounded lame. Seeing it on camera though was completely differnt. Finally the burning questions of who Reys parents are are finally revealed, Snokes origins were revealed to be nothing, and it went over a lot of peoples heads how Palpatine was still alive. He cloned himself, which means the Palpatine that died in 6 wasnt the real Palpatine. And the people that did catch that and hated it... How come you liked it in the Expanded Universe/Legends but not canon? Hmmm okay.... Anyways, it was also the first Star Wars film my wife saw with me and she liked it as well. To me, it wasnt the ending of the Skywalker saga I wanted, but I finally got closure which is what I wanted and needed. The movie wasnt perfect in any way shape or form, but it was a comfortable ending I think we all needed. The problem with Star Wars and long time fans is that they're stuck so long in the past that they dont know how to enjoy a new one. Give it a chance, stop looking at silly theory stories and let the story unfold for you. I thought it was good.",1
4729,5.0,"One thing is you have to put in your brain. There will never be a match for the Original Trilogy. Never! That doesn't mean that you cannot give some quality movies or series inside the realm of Star Wars. The prequels had major issues. Most of the dialogue was bad, some acting and too much CGI for a universe that was applauded for being realistic and lived. It was still fun to watch. When Disney bought Lucasfilms I feared the worse and then I they told us that they wanted something with the vibe of the OT and we were satisfied. The Force Awakens, while being a rehash is a hell of a ride and it felt like Star Wars. The problem came afterwards. There was no plan for the trilogy. The producer and president, Kathleen Kennedy, rushed everything and with firings and mishaps, didn't came out of this with a good image. The Last Jedi burned almost all bridges that JJ set and divided the fandom. People hated it. Didn't felt like a Star Wars movie, although had some good moments. But what really stood was that it was disjointed from the previous film. JJ set a thing (Rey's heritage, Luke's hiding on a island of the first Jedi Temple, surely for gaining more knowledge, he was in his Jedi Robes when Rey found him). Who was Snoke. Everybody failed in the Last Jedi and the movie felt almost like the end of a trilogy instead of the middle chapter. When things got out of control, Kennedy fired the third director/writer and JJ came back. Now he's in charge again and he needs a plan B because there's almost nothing for the story to move forward. What to do? Retcon almost everything that Rian Johnson burned. It's sad that there was no overall plan. Palpatine was never in the mix, they lied when they said he was. And the franchise was poorly handled. Can you imagine that only four years after the major impact of The Force Awakens people stop caring about Star Wars, the merchandising is selling, the parks aren't getting the visitors they were expecting, one movie (Solo) bombed. It's sad but it's what you get when you think that the name of Star Wars only will give you everything. And so we got to the final part of this sequel trilogy. Expectations were low and I only wanted was a fun movie. And that's I got. JJ sticks the landing, even though there are a lot of issues and pacing problems with it. It felt like two movies condensed into 2 hours and a half and many things felt a bit rush. But it is what it is and, keeping in mind that it's only a movie, it was a well spent time in cinema and sometimes you just have to let it go. And, after watching Return of The Jedi for the first time, in 1988, I say goodbye to my beautiful franchise and take a last look at my ""friends"". The Saga ended and for me the thrill of Star Wars ended too.",0

It's hard saying goodbye to characters I think the bittersweet aspect is tough for some fans and maybe that's the reason for the mixed reactions so far. I feel like this will become more beloved with time.",1
4732,4.0,"40 years worth of the story OF Anakin Slywalker ...all for nothing. He ends up having no effect on anything. For those of you who are into star wars only in the last 10 or so years...it's ANAKINS story. ""Return of the Jedi"" is actually ANAKIN returning to being a Jedi again, it's not about Luke, mind blower to many people to learn. And what's it lead to? Anakin gets to say (don't see him) about 8 words, and no...they don't mean anything at all. We also know Ashoka is dead now too.. as we heard her spirit talking to Rey, so that's great (NOT!!!)",1

The generation of kids born in this century didn't get to experience the surprise 70's kids did in Empire Strikes back when we learn Darth Vader is Luke's father, but learning Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter was the perfect surprise that left you shocked and on the edge of your seat! Then to top that off, Kylo Ren reverts to Ben Solo saving Rey in the end, plus we get to witness the much anticipated kiss between Rey and Ben. Words cannot describe how great this movie was, with the perfect comedic timing and shock that General Hux is the spy giving the Resistance information! The cameo of the Ewoks was a perfect reference to Return of the Jedi. I also personally loved all the cameos and references made off all the famous Jedis throughout the Star Wars series. This is just a fantastic film! I could not believe the negative reviews to such an amazing film! Go see the movie and decide for yourself, I believe it was a perfect ending to this trilogy.",1

Dont understand why people are looking so deep into these movies. I'm pretty sure George Lucas didn't when he made the first trilogy, he just made a scifi adventure which is what this is. Maybe they have tried to cram too many story arcs into it but the main story is easy to follow with some surprises along the way. So many new characters have been introduced that can be built on with books within the universe gives plenty for fans for years to come.",1

But mostly this movie is cut so bad, so you can almost not follow the the utterly simple plot that follows every story cliché it can. It has no flow and no phasing, it's just meaningless chaos. It makes the Star Wars universe feel smaller then my back yard, people just teleports all over the place. And it also changes rules and makes up new rules of that universe, with no explanation and also no meaning behind it. It doesn't make sense. I actually don't understand how you can make something this bad. And all the characters fals flat on top of that.",0

Make a new Saga installment to much like the originals and it's a rip-off, make anything new and progressive it's blasphemous. The Force Awakens was a lot like the originals and that wasn't a bad thing if the next movie was properly progressive. However, in my opinion, the last Jedi was trying but was not successful and was the worst star wars movie to date, this movie is right in the middle. I loved so much of this movie but there were many obvious flaws I'm gonna on this movie and then but some praise on its name. This movie failed the Knights of Ren, teased since before THe Force Awakens to be slaughtered with ease two movies later in their first fight. They used a Sword with a pull-out map, would work for like a side clue, maybe but not the main element. The acting wasn't bad but was nothing better or more evolved than the last few with these same characters. They still don't feel completely comfortable in the roles like they should, given the chemistry, they showed in the Force Awakens they had to rebuild everyone almost. The Last Jedi messed up even if you liked the music, the CGI, the sets, everything like that.. it destroyed most character development and hurt the story going forward in so many ways. There are some other flaws but those are the bigger ones I have so far or maybe for now. I've seen this movie two times and the first time i liked the pacing and I loved it on the second viewing it had two points where I was like okay let's go. mostly the second act still really really good. The force was incredible to see so strong and powerful and used in the proper ways, now that we can show its UNLIMITED POWER!<br /><br />I liked how Princess Leia passed away and how Kylo now Ben solo and her were so strongly connected given she is his mother. Kylo seeing Han and him having that moment like Han always wanted to give them both that rest was incredible and helped Ben become okay and see he has to most likely die to bring peace. I liked how they kissed but him just falling after that was a bit much and Rey not becoming a force ghost like he did was interesting. Kylo was the best part of this entire new trilogy in a lot of ways. I believe the third act was one of the more thought out element bringing and refreshing of the entire Saga. The ending was very good in my opinion Rey was always searching for a mother and father to call her own and finding out she was a Palpatine she wanted a better name and what better than Skywalker, this is the Rise of Skywalker.<br /><br />Critics loved The Last Jedi and this movie was fixing a lot of in their eyes positives but in most fan's eyes mistakes. so obviously critics dislike it and since they do many people feel uncomfortable saying its a good movie.",0

Solo was a good idea with very poor execution, and The Last Jedi is a disaster. I will say people take their hate for TLJ way too far. But anyways, the franchise was struggling. Then they made this film, The Rise of Skywalker. Mind blown. This film is shocking (in a good way), visually stunning, very well written (especially compared to other non-original trilogy Star Wars movies) and overall just a very thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the Saga. One reason TLJ was bad was the dialogue. The dialogue was pretty terrible. In TROS, the dialogue is a big step up. Still not the most talented dialogue writing EVER, but the failed attempts at humor and cheesy remarks are almost completely gone. The action is great and exciting. The film offers a very satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It is a very fitting end. As for critic reviews, they don't like it because of the fan service. But guess what, fans are going to really appreciate and even love the fan service. It sounds like they are just kissing up to fans after TLJ, but if you think about it thats kind of what a good franchise writer would do. They hear complaints and fix it to make it enjoyable, and pays homage and mimics the tone of the best installments in the series.

And if anyone has any desire to enjoy things in life (since everything changes) I would suggest letting go of what you expect and accept what is being presented. If new and different insults you, just keeping watching the old things that are within your comfort zone. The movie was entertaining, it had great action scenes!",1
4765,7.0,"Don't get me wrong, Daisy Ridley did a good job. I just don't think Adam Driver was good enough. If you're going to do the Dark Guy you have to have some sass. Also I think that some other characters should have gotten a little more prominence. I was not impressed with Fisher in this one. Just didn't seem the same. It still had some oomph in places. But hey in this day and age I guess we expect more. And in the previous ones, I didn't like Hayden Christensen. Just didn't seem right. Nevertheless I'm giving Ridley an ""A.""",1

You took a huge dump on in all. Im a huge SW fan. Read it all, seen it all, played it all. And will continue to do so. The taste has soured tho. But hey, its a very pretty picture.

4769,8.0,"I have not been a huge fan of the plots of Disney's new Star Wars trilogy. This movie is no different. There are times during this movie that I felt as though the story line was way out of left field, or incongruent with the rest of the Star Wars series. If you're a huge fan of the Star Wars story, this movie is just meh.",0
4770,9.0,"All I wanted out of this movie was the general impression that this was a classic Star Wars story to end the Skywalker saga. I wanted the feeling I had in 1977....and I GOT IT. This was very good and the ending was fitting. My 11 year-old daughter was with me and she cried several times, so she was emotionally invested in the story and was happy. I agree with cramming so much in to straighten out the mess with ""The Last Jedi"" was a tough nut to crack. This movie works and works well. It's not perfect. That's okay with me because I left the theater feeling I was entertained and put into the classic struggle between good vs evil. This movie delivered on that. The only thing I would have wanted was Anakin Skywalker force ghost also counseling Rey with Luke's force ghost, or Anakin's FG in the Sith grand room. To me that would have bookended the beginning/ending. I'm happy Rose didn't have much dialogue. Chewy and Lando was great. I do think it's important to not overly nit-pick it. Yes, Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson were terrible people to touch Star Wars. The way they worked older scenes with Carrie Fisher/Leah works. Palpatine was a great villain being the ultimate puppet master. It's love/hate with that character. This was a general audience crowd pleaser and it delivered on that. We plan to watch this many times.",1
4771,6.0,"Star Wars movies always have the potential to be something great, and the reason I was hopeful for the sequels was because they kept teasing at something great happening. I was looking for a solid ending, a moral, something for me to feel satisfied with. What I got was predictable, a disappointing and unnecessary rehash of the ending of the originals with nothing new or unique. Simply a cash grab of a series that was scared to do anything actually groundbreaking.",0
4772,1.0,"I was unpleasantly surprised about the movie after 10 minutes from the beginning, and later was worse and worse. Then they showed Babu Frik, and I used to feel that I was watching Star Wars in 1983- that cool was the effects of created character.

4773,8.0,"The best movie in the trilogy. Epic in both visuals, acting, music and also writing. An action based movie but one that still captures the essence of star wars and brings a lot of emotions. Ties the whole trilogy together nicley and honestly redeems the last jedi a bit (which also has received undeservingly bad reviews, it's not a great star wars movie, but it's not bad). The Rise of Skywalker is a worthy end to a decent last trilogy, and to the entire epic saga.",1

4775,6.0,"STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER: Aside from John Williams rousing score, IX is a resounding bore and I mean put-you-to-sleep, boring. There is nothing new here except for a cute little WALL-E wanna-be robot who ads nothing to the story, as paper thin as that is. Except for Daisy Ridley who's just passible and who's asked to do little more than lightsaber fight (again we've seen this a thousand times) and physical action (which she does in wonderful fashion), the acting across the board (direction) left me cold, especially Oscar Isaac who just doesn't cut it. There's just something about that guy that doesn't register with me. He's simply miscast. Adam Driver does a good job of looking threatening/mean and little else. Carrie Fisher is the best thing in the movie probably because her scenes were from another movie. Mark Hamill phoned in his one scene and looks like he just woke from a nap and could barely be bothered. The biggest disappointment of the film is the lack of relationships between the characters. Whatever their previous history was, it's just not evident here, so we just don't care. I will admit there was a two minute scene very near the end that got me. The action sequences are redundant and if you've seen one, you've seen them all. This franchise has run it's course for sure and if I never see another one, I won't regret it. Score: 6. Don't go. A lot of empty space. 12/24/19",0
4776,8.0,"This is an entertaining movie. The story does suffer but it's still there and it's decent. Ultimately, I enjoyed it and am glad to have more Star Wars even if they weren't perfect. I think nostalgia blinds most fans of the weaknesses in the story of the original trilogy.. it wasn't THAT amazing. But it captured our imaginations at a time when sci-fi was still in its infancy, in particular on the big screen. Personally, I feel the prequel trilogy was at least as bad as this new trilogy if not worse.",1
4777,6.0,"I appreciated the scene with the sandworm swallow as Poe utters the phrase ""last jump, possibly forever"".

4778,5.0,"This review is for the movie and the recent trilogy, as this movie caps off the trilogy. Basically, the trilogy as a whole is very disjointed and inconsistent. There are several threads not tied off, and several weird plot holes that don't make any sense. Disney should have had a better plan here and should have stuck to the plan. I just hope that future movies have some better controls for their plans.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it was okay. Not great, not terrible, just okay. I am a long time fan of all things star wars, so I liked the ""star wars-y"" stuff (lightsaber fights, space battles and uses of the force). However, as a movie the pacing is WAY too fast, and they are trying to cram WAY too much content into 2.5 hours. This should have been a 3.5 hour movie for the amount of content to cover, or just cut some content. A big ""fetch quest"" and a whole lot of obvious ""well that was convenient"". Introducing some new characters for the sake of characters and not developing the current trilogy cast very much. This one was like Last Jedi to me, unremarkable. But, Last Jedi had a lot more severe plot and character problems. This one and Last Jedi go down as some of my least favorite. With my favorites still being: Rogue One, Force Awakens and Return of the Jedi. Go ahead and see it in the theater, and keep supporting Star Wars, I think Disney will learn from this first go at a trilogy.",0

4780,7.0,"This movie in all prospective is not a bad one, the story is appealing that I do not want to stretch my leg during the movie unlike episode VIII. Finally this is the end of the story of Skywalker and Sith. Star war series create a wonderful world, we could certainly create a lot of great movie inside it. For example, I like rogue one very much. But please do not create another story of Jedi, skywalker, redemption, it is way to cliche after 9 movies. Create another story line which just let us see the world, I believe it would have a better reception than bring back Luke again and again and again.",1
4781,7.0,Just saw the film the 2nd day after it premiered. I liked the film and the characters. I will probably see it only once in the theater. It's a nice end to the saga...if it really is the end.,1
4782,10.0,"Highly enjoyable, satisfying, thrilling, emotional, smart storytelling, bold and fitting of the Star Wars legacy. Loved it. Ignore the vocal minority of haters with the emotional intelligence of a gang of 13 year olds slamming the movie because it decides not to carry all their emotional baggage for them. Instead, the film dares to be its own thing. Rise of Skwalker honours all that has gone before, brings fresh ideas to the screen and delights the audience along the way. Tune out the idiot noise and enjoy this conclusion to a remarkable piece of cinema.",1
4783,6.0,"It's not bad, but it's certainly not great either. I remember watching ""A New Hope"" as a kid and being mesmerised by it, causing a manhunt when 10 as my mum let me watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on my own but I hid in the cinema and watched the next 2 showings before emerging from the cinema at about 10.30pm to be greeted by my distraught mum and half of Kent Constabulary. Still I didn't care, I had witnessed what I thought was the greatest film ever. Jedi (episode 6) was flawed, but still very Star Wars. I remember the excitement as an adult when the first 3 episodes were muted, only to be met by some of the worst drivel I have ever witnessed (Mr Lucas you should be ashamed) . So we fast forward to Disney's adaptation of the Star Wars universe, Its all just a bit meh, this film included, yes its more polished and spectacular, but if it wasn't Star Wars it would be panned even more than I expect it will be. I don't really buy into the characters, they are all safe and boring. It's messy, long and dare I say it, tired with no direction just ticking boxes. Nothing really makes any sense. I don't want to give anything away from this film, but even the return of an old enemy feels desperate like the writers were trying to appease die hard fans, but it's no Vader. Overall I don't think the Disney juggernaut has brought anything to the Star Wars universe (although I enjoyed the stand alone Rogue One) this film may conclude the seties, but by no means as a true Star Wars fan do I feel satisfied, but the sadder thing is I don't think I want any more.",0

4786,10.0,"I'm not going to spoil anything in this review, but I must say after reading the horrible reviews on this site I was a tad nervous. They must have seen a different movie because the last Skywalker saga was a truly great movie. They delivered the right mix of action, adventure and emotional scenes, more or less non-stop throughout the movie. The only issue I had was it seemed a bit too rushed. I've always stated that they should and could have split this movie In two parts. However needless to say this was only a small gripe. I'm very happy the way it ended and was very happily surprised that Star Wars is back in form between this movie, the TV show and the video game, but more on those two things later.",1
4787,1.0,"Episode 8 was a weak story so episode 9 tries to distance itself from its prequel. A film made as damage limitation, which also tries to revert back to an overused star wars plot formula. Why couldn't Disney tell the fans an original story around these characters? It tries to achieve so much that it feels like a 2.5h long trailer.",0
4788,10.0,"I waited for so long for this movie. I counted years, months, weeks, days and hours to watch it. I anticipated it with excitement and sadness and fear of what would be showed to us as the very end of the Skywalkers and the Star Wars Saga with which I grew up. For the first half of the movie I was so excited Iwanted to scream! Everything was so thrilling and adventurous, full of action with awesome duels and starship fights. Then... THEN... came an endless roller-coaster ride! I was constantly jaw-dropped. Unexpected surprises, sad surprises, subversive developments ....The whole movie was an enormous plot-twist! There were many deja-vu scenes, memories and lines, but not disappointing. They were necessary for a perfect conclusion. I liked this movie, I LOVED this movie, until the point where one of my most beloved characters didn't end up the way I wish. They chose a different path for him, which I might comprehend better in time...I always give 10/10 to all the Star Wars movies, because I'm a helpless fan and love everything StarWars-y with all its perfections and all its flaws. So, yeah, I might wanted a different ending, but I know I will learn to love and accept the way it is. That's it. It's not gonna change. In real life everything works pretty the same!",1
4789,1.0,In a word: awful! This entire new trilogy has been a mess: a typical habit of yet another franchise being ruined by Jj Abrams.<br /><br />A patchwork story that lacks the basic continuity and story telling of the original saga: most characters not even getting the chance to truly develop; after three films still not really getting to know them like we did in the originals.,0

The scenes are insane, all over the place and not long enough to explain anything. The ending is a bit bizarre but maybe because my expectations were so low, I was ok with everything. I was dreading to go see it and waited to see it but I liked it. I mean it's still not Star Wars though.",1

The look, the stars, the space and the spaceships tied me to the screen. The music in the dark cinema for the opening crawl gave me goosebumps. But I still left the cinema disappointed, because the music and the look were almost the only good things. The plot was very predictable, Darth Sidious as the new / old villain didn't convince me, the sudden introduction of force healing abilities and the Sith wayfinder are very implausible and only serve to make the ending they wanted. The alleged death of Chewbacca is also unbelievable, why should they let one of the fan favorits die offscreen? I liked Kylo Ren/Adam Driver in the whole Triliogy and in this film and I liked his connection with Rey. Over one year later still a disappointing plot that I don't like but it has a nice Star Wars Feeling.",0
4797,10.0,"I seriously don't understand why people didn't like this movie. Perhaps one of the better love stories, and the bond between Rey, Fin, and Po remind me so much of Han, Leia, and Luke, the same family/sibling like bond.

4804,4.0,"Negatives: This movie felt like a stitched together collage of various fan service moments at break neck speeds. There was no time to settle into characters or develop their stories properly. New characters injected into the story served no purpose to the overall story. It felt like a vacuum pulling the scenes towards a black hole where no light comes out of it. The story felt like it could have been written by anyone and the script gave no of the actors real human moments like past movies. Too much comedy and not enough fleshed out dramatic or character world building moments. Rey and Kylo Ren have too much force powers and isn't reasonability explained. The explanations fell flat and didn't make a whole lot of sense. Finn and Poe didn't have much of a role to the plot. Finn is always hollering ""Rey"". They inserted so much stuff in the movie that it can no longer fit its pants. The fights were okay with nothing sticking out.",0

4806,9.0,"I really loved this movie but am only giving it a 7 for selfish reasons. I went in with really high expectations and totally wanted to see some more force ghosts involved. Don't get me wrong, I loved the part when you heard all the past Jedi's calling out to Rey, Inwipd he just liked to have seen them, especially Anakin. And for all the haters out there that are trying to compare the new trilogy with the originals. We aren't 10 yrs old anymore seeing something that's never been done before. If Episode IV, ANH came out today, there is no chance it would have the same popularity that it had back then. Every generation is different.",1

4808,4.0,As per title I saw this opening week in the uk managed to avoid any reviews so gave it an open mind. As for the other 2 films in this trilogy within a trilogy Which I was disappointed with not bad films in general just terrible story arc. And after seeing the latest one it runs on the same theme good film bad story for the film. And that is where my score dropped after a days thinking about what I saw. And what I saw within this film was a story that should have been utilised from the beginning of this 3rd trilogy and not as it seams just made up for one film to conclude it. Again as Disney have done with Endgame they have forced one story into a film out of where 2 ( for endgame ) and 3 for rise of Sky Walker could and should have been the case. I'm both of these films the story was in my opinion told to the cinema goers not let flow out within the films actions as I don't want to add spoiler for this film I will use Endgame as an example. We were never shown really how captain marvel found and got to know the rest of the avengers we were just told it happened. Now that could have been a good 10/15 minutes of the film and we were never again told how they got the pager after fury dusted we we just told. Now this latest star wars film does pretty much similar it tells us a lot but doesn't show us enough. If they had have used this story over the 3 films from the start then there were so many ways each of the other 2 could have been better.,0
4809,10.0,This was so much fun to watch. Went with my family and we were elated by its end. Finally a Star Wars movie with no easy solutions that instantly destroy the enemy. Amazing payoffs for the whole series. Fantastic movie all on its own as well. Recommended!,1

There were many call backs. At one time, I felt like I was watching remakes of certain scenes from past movies. Had a few moments that I felt were pretty good. Kinda tugged at my heart a bit then ripped it out once again with more fast pacing or something else. Maybe I should give it a 6, nah will give a 7. It is SW and the end of George Lucas's dream so it at least deserves that. R.I.P.",0

4817,7.0,"Though, that isn't saying much. Enough about TLJ. The Rise of Skywalke has its flaws, but at least it is entertaining. There were moments that felt forced or scenes that should have been given more time and context to play out, but were instead very short and rushed. In fact, I think rushed would be a good word to describe the entire movie. They tried to fit in a lot of plot into this movie, which made everything feel rushed and many of the scenes they wanted to be emotional didn't hit hard at all.",0

4822,9.0,"As far as the feel of the movie go's the overall outcome I feel was a success. The new trilogy will over all go down as the same as the prequel trilogy, either you enjoy it or you wont. I extremely enjoyed the dynamic between the cast in this movie more then any other star wars movie, your able to generally see how much they care for one another as an actual family would. i also was a lot more impressed with how they did Palpatien and the Sith lore over all in a more universal sense. Having been born into a family the pretty much worshiped Star Wars as a religion, for an ending to the overall saga i feel J.J. Abrams did an amazing homage to the whole saga unlike his take on force awakens which just showed love to the original trilogies. If I'm being honest my biggest complaint to the movie is the fact it never really feels like an ending, I feel like they had so much more to say about these new characters that they just did not have enough time for. with out an overall story board to go off other directors for the new trilogy went off there own story and that required both to do work for their respective movies. Overall i had a great time and this movie is worth watching even if your just wondering how the story ends.",1

The positive emotions and exciting fan surprises brought me back to the wonderful feelings of when I was real young and saw Return of the Jedi in 1983. Any extreme so-called fans that say this film is ""bad"" is an idiot. That is my opinion and several others which have vast knowledge of Star Wars, strongly devoted to the franchise. My friends all loved it, the ""critics"" are not seeing how it's all related like the vastness of the Harry Potter saga. If you know the past events of Potter, whichever film you are watching is enhanced from earlier films. Anyhow, DEFINITELY better than The Last Jedi so it's a HUGE win!!",1

4837,6.0,"What can I say... I mean I was not terribly disappointed, but I also was not fascinated. I had loads of expectations, because this was the ending of a saga we all will not forget. Unfortunately, it had some moments in it that I thought could've been executed much better. First of all, let's begin with General Hux for example. He apparently was a mole in this movie... Just great! After everything that has happened in the other movies, suddenly he decided to turn against the First Order out of nowhere. Yeah, he maybe had an awkward relationship with Kylo Ren but still... And then he got killed off... Secondly, the development of the discovery of Rey's identity. She's a Palpatine. I MEAN WHAT IS GOING ON? Who of her parents was Palpatine's child? Didn't they have the Force to protect them when Rey got left behind? And then Palpatine has been trying to lure Rey into his tomb this whole movie to turn her to the dark side of the Force. But before he makes an attempt, Kylo Ren (who now is Ben since he changed his mind just after a simple memory of his father) stops Rey from becoming dark. I mean this was so disappointing, I so much hoped she would turn and the movie would've ended with a big anti-climax, but sadly no... She first get's hit by Palpatine's lightning Force power hands and then she still manages to stand up, get two lightsabers and kill him off.... I mean what is going on? I got so confused with this movie. It made no sense at all... Then Ben comes back up, because he got pushed away and fell in a hole that was deep. He survived that. Meanwhile Rey is dead because she used so much Force on Palpatine. Ben saves Rey and they kiss. THEN BEN DIES? I gave up on that point. This is just a small part of what I think of the movie. Don't get me started on Finn... Poe was okay...",0
4838,9.0,Loved the movie. Tied up alot of loose ends from TLJ which I'm happy about. Makes you wonder what the last movie could have been like if Abraham's wrote it.,1
4839,9.0,"I am a huge star wars fan, going into the movie I heard a lot of people hating online and it made me anxious for what's ahead. I'm very critical of star wars, but let me tell you, this movie is amazing. If you're open minded and don't follow everyone else hating because that's all they know how to do, you will love it like I did. People can disagree that's fine, but truthfully the current rating of 6.7 does no way justify the movie that we got. The acting is superb and we get some great fan service. Thanks Disney, some of these characters have now become my favourites.",1
4840,1.0,Well they managed to make a character worse than jar jar binks. Kylo ren is to Star Wars what nickleback is to music. Absolute rubbish. Such a shame the final trilogy is ruined by a spoilt child Whose only place in the film is to get angry and upset because he doesn't get his own way. Kylo ren aka the worst thing to ever come from the Star Wars universe,0
4841,7.0,"This film was..okay. Moderately underwhelming. If you're looking for non stop Anakin Skywalker, look elsewhere. It is not the droid you're looking for. Though, there are some cute droids in this movie. The old ones, the sort of old one, and one completely new one. Ben Solo returns, yay!! There's a really sweet moment to look for..actually, two. Depends on your shipping habits. It doesn't end the way you expect, not quite..but balance of the force is achieved, Palp dies, First Order is defeated, RIP Hux, 'nuff said.",0

4843,5.0,"If Endgame is a fine paella, with all fascinating ingredients cooked to storytelling perfection, delicately mixed into one grand, emotional one-last-ride narrative, and even decorated with some absolutely mesmerizing moments that would let all of us beg for more...<br /><br />Then this, the Rise of Skywalker, is a (very) mediocre rice porridge, where all the ingredients are incomplete and half-cooked. The entire story telling is muddied up in the endless nostalgic showing-off and ended up disconnected and incoherent. Watching this film reminds me of an over-zealous novice chef serving a set menu that he was deeply proud of: he would always send an too ambitious dish out and stand right next to me; before I could finish one plate, he would toss me another dish and rush me to go through the entire night, even, at the end of the night, blindly adding some unpleasant and unbalanced extra spices that he considered as surprises.<br /><br />""No, chef, they really weren't pleasant surprises."" Same words to J. J. Abrams.<br /><br />I did cry. I cried hard. But I cried for my memories of Star Wars as an important part of my life now officially ended, not for this film itself.<br /><br />This film also proved to us as another example, following GoT, how unimaginably difficult to craft an end chapter for a massive storytelling universe and franchise.",0

4845,4.0,"Rated this movie just beyond rotten - while entertaining, this movie was vanilla, and vanilla is not my favourite flavour. Star Wars series began with innovating entertainment beyond our expectations. JJ Abrams had all the people, technology, and money to deliver an innovative experience. Rather, the experience was a linear simple plot with perfect special effects etc that made it just another hollywood movie. Why vanilla then? ... Better movies cater plot to speciific audiences, and this plot for this movie was made to please all audiences. JJ Abrams could also have catered the plot to the original fans by making it more controversial.",1

4849,1.0,"I am not disappointed like I was with The Force Awakens. Its was clear then JJ Abrams is making a disney version of star wars, just milking the franchise for profit. Hence I wasn't disappointed with The Last Jedi, and I am not disappointed with The Rise of Skywalker. If anything, this movie is a decent conclusion of this flashy-with-little-substance trilogy. Its not 1/10 and its certainly not anywhere close to 10/10, this is firmly in the 5/10 to 7/10 range (depending on your mood) like the other movies in this trilogy.",0

4853,8.0,"I loved this movie but it's got issues because the last Jedi completely screwed up the overall story arch of the trilogy. This movie tries to be episode 8 & 9 but it's just too short in length. There is a ton of stuff packed in this movie and that makes this movie really fast paced. Despite all the challenges JJ Abrams had placed on him with Carrier Fisher death and Rian Johnson bad writing I think he did a fairly good job. I wished this movie was longer to have more time to correct the mistakes of last Jedi. I blame the corporate figure heads running Lucas films into the ground. StarWars has so much lore that can be used from the past 30 years of novels and it is sad that instead of making great cinema StarWars is being used as a platform to push Kathleen Kennedy personal and political views. I'm all for equality, but I'm paying to see great cinema not be force fed her personal views. Lucasfilms needs new leadership.",1
4854,10.0,I really liked this movie I really do not know why or how people giving one star reviews I think that they are getting payed but this is the best star wars movie ever best last episode,1
4855,7.0,"After watching The Last Jedi,I was thinking about quitting to watch Star Wars because The movie was very boring and terrible.I didn't even watch Solo because it was another unnecessary movie.Eventually I was still supposed to watch The Rise Of He Skywalker because I still wanted to see How they are going to fix it or,really,just leave it unfixed.Fortunately,it was at least worth going to The theatre.As The movie wasn't as bad as The last one.In fact,it could even be considered as a good movie.In my opinion,George Lucas just wanted us to remember The old Star Wars movies by adding little easter Eggs and Side charecters related to The old movies.I especially liked The stormtrooper gelmekte that were seen in The Death Star when Rey visits The ancient Death Star.Also The ending was nice as well",0
4856,3.0,"I'd like to write a detailed review, but all I can say is, J.J. Abrams must let Star Wars go. He must allow someone else to take charge, anyone could be better. I had no excitement even in final scene. Low quality acting, childish story. He vilified dark side too much. (I'm on the service of light!) So anyway, waste of money, no need to go theatre, wait it to be available on internet. And again, If you don't change tactics, I'm not going anymore to Star Wars movies. Director, STAY AWAY FROM MANDALORIAN, let it be safe and beautiful!",0
4857,9.0,"No movie is... As far as a compelling story and a good ending to something that has been built up for decades, I'll take it and I'll appreciate it for what it is. I enjoyed watching this movie and I appreciate that they tried to fix what they could and still come to a conclusion.",1
4858,2.0,"Disney is rich, very rich and they delivered this.",0
4859,1.0,"I didn't really get any emotional value from this movie it tried so hard to cram everything in 2 and a half hours with little character development and full of major plot holes, for example luke Skywalker and palpatine, they turned luke into a hypocrite and palpatine explained his reasoning for being alive in a worthless one worded answer, and ot was never explained after that point in the movie, my favorite character was boba frick he was absolutely hilarious and he was so cute, to end this review of i were you i wouldn't waste my money or my time on this movie once was enough for me and even then i didn't want to see it, I'll upload a review of it on my YouTube channel at a later date please do go and subscribe to my YouTube channel at AncientOsprey68 and I hope you guys enjoy my review and I'll see you on the next one!

4863,10.0,"SPOILER ALERT(if you haven't seen the movie leave now !) I really enjoyed this movie i love how they wiped up all the mistakes the last Jedi made and they fixed it and I loved how they made luke believe again and they fixed all of rian Johnsons mistakes. Ok, that's the last time I'm gonna say that mans name, I really enjoyed this movie with the references to past movies and I really enjoyed the final battle and I was really suprised when i found out rey was a Palpatine and i loved the reference to the two brothers of the knights of the old republic my favorite part of the movie and the part i really enjoyed was when all the Jedi of the past talked to rey and Anakin said ""Rey bring back the balance like i did."" The other parts i liked were the flashback to Leias training with luke and that fight that was really cool, As well as the character arc of Ben Solo and how he redeemed himself and became one with the force the parts that i didn't like was how the Jedi's of the past didn't show up as force ghosts i wish that had happened but nonetheless a great moment and i didn't like how she called herself a Skywalker after being told ""don't be afraid of who you are"" you're not a Skywalker you're a Palpatine it'd be like Anakin saying I'm Anakin Kenobi you're not you're a Kenobi it's wrong i did like how we saw rey's orange lightsaber i wish we saw her building it though, nonetheless it was a great movie and a great way to end the saga.

4867,10.0,"I watched the original and was never impressed with the story, the acting, the dialog, etc. I was impressed with the effects generated for that time period, with the exception of the nanosecond it took for the massive Death Star to be completely blown up.

I appreciate the series nonetheless as it was a catalyst for greater things to come, both in the Star Wars story, and for the genre on the big screen.",1
4868,1.0,"This was the most derivative movie they could have put together. It worked really hard to make you forget about the mistakes of it's predecessor at the cost of any originality on its own merits. Remember Y-WINGS, JAWAS, THE OG DEATH STAR, AND WHO COULD FORGET AUNT BERU AND UNCLE OWNES FARM ON TATOOINE? The Emp was just doing his regular thing being a angry boy and Lando was cool but the rest was just an obvious ploy to get you to remember ""the good ole days"". Ugh. CRINGE.",1

4871,10.0,"Words can't express how bad I hated this trilogy especially The Last Jedi. I went into this movie knowing I would hate it. Walked out absolutely thrilled. They gave the franchise back to the fans. Repaired as much as they could of TLJ, effects were incredible (CGI Princess Leia). I even liked the characters by the end of the movie that I have been ranting on for years. Tip of the cap to you #jjabrahams",0
4872,10.0,"I loved it. I hated the last Jedi though, and was so skeptical coming into the theater to see Rise of Skywalker. Even the title of the movie threw me off. Would it be cheesy? Cheap? Thrown together? Would the ending be too predictable? To be fair, I did guess most plot twists, but the biggest plot twist in history already happened. Is another ""I am your father"" moment even possible? The last Jedi left a huge mess for JJ to clean up. I'll mention he had to do it in two hours as well. Every scene was beautiful. The connections to other movies were well placed and meaningful. The ending really did give a sense of closure and excitement. The now 40 year old men who sat in a theater and saw Luke Skywalker for the first time. They will never relive that. If that's what you are expecting, you will be disappointed. So put yourself in the mind of a young girl, a young boy. Look for the hope. The unity. The adventure and battles. A story in a galaxy far far away, a tale told a long time ago. Lessons that are eternal, morals that are universal, packaged neatly in our favorite characters submerged in plots that move and excite us. That is what Star Wars is about. And that's what this movie is about. Search within yourself, you know it to be true. #okayboomers?",1
4873,8.0,Episode VII was a bit disappointing but ok.,0
4874,6.0,"It is not as bad as the other two. So why the hate? B/c that is the nature of hate. It was going around YouTube for so long and if you check carefully a lot of the hate is repetitive-- (one person says something and everyone repeats it). Now that does not make it true or false but that is what is going on. So everyone is talking about Fan service, I heard that criticism already? i heard it had in many themes-- true but that is not its biggest sin, failure to create a story we got invested in was the problem. Still better than Last Jedi. Even that title is clickbait, just like this one. The major issues are how UNORIGINAL it is, mirroring great work from decades ago. JJ or Jah Jah has a talent for polishing other people's genius (quoting someone). He is not that talented-- really he is not. Anyone with true talent would not Twice now have to ape what was done before. And somethings in this film are so stupid he invites criticism. did he not show this film to serious people before green-lighting some of this nonsense<br /><br />'",1
4875,1.0,"I love Disney, but for them to have the last say in Star Wars was a terrible idea. They took a story that was so genius and pure, and made it meaningless. To me, the Disney trilogy will never be an addition to the story of Anakin and Luke Skywalker.",0

We got answers from questions that where asked in The Force Awakens, it was a brilliant film with a great story line and we finally get to see the Emperor again!

4881,10.0,"So I will keep this short and no spoilers. The movie was excellent. It had a good story. Very emotional. Definitely the best of the new trilogy.

4882,8.0,"This is definitely the best movie out of the new trilogy. The thing that makes it so good are the emotional scenes and connections to the original trilogy.

They are damnd if they do and damned if they dont, catch 22 folks. I think they did a hell of a job on this one. 10/10",1

My apologies to those who have said this is the best of ALL the Star Wars films, in my opinion it wasn't. I even struggled with giving this film a 6 or an 8, so I settled on a 7 (which is probably too generous).",0

No. But for adamantly denigrating any and all effort that was put into the making of this film, and the many fans of it's accompanying Sequel Trilogy... Opinions are opinions. But with bitterness, with malice, why bother? Too often I see on YouTube, ""film critics"" discuss and divulge the problems with The Rise of Skywalker. It's hard not to agree with them, as they'll occasionally bring up valid points regarding the story. So, I don't know why I find myself enjoying this movie.",1

And maybe it was because of my lower expectations, but Episode IX blew me away almost immediately. It's the best Star Wars experience I have ever had! I'm not old enough to have experienced the original trilogy as it was released, so don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this is a better Star Wars film than back then.

The film is very fasted-paced and there is never a dull moment. It was not perfect but the good definitely outweighed the bad",1
4894,9.0,"At first I thought this sequel was just ok. After the the last Jedi which I'm my opinion did everything it could to end the Skywalker saga, I felt that The Rise... could not undo all the damage that was done in the last film. After seeing it a second time at home I noticed that there were many subtle moments that cheeped to connect the dots for me. To my fellow Star Wars fans, these 3 films had a lot to live up to and for most of us the originals were part of growing up. That said I think JJ did all that could be expected given the above issues. I definitely loved it the second tone around.",1

4903,8.0,I had a few gripes with some of what happens in this film but as a whole I enjoyed watching it and thought they had done a good job saving this trilogy after The last jedi which was simply abysmal. I still think the films should've ended with ROTJ and these films should've gone in a different direction entirely but what they have done with this film I was pleased with however I can only give this 8/10 because there are some minor issues I have with the film which I don't agree with in the star wars universe but I encourage any fan to watch this and don't be put off by the previous one.,1

He didn't bring Balance to the force, Rey did. So pretty much what was that even for. Honestly the most cringeworthy Star Wars Movie i've ever seen. A bad mix of Pirates of the Caribbean and Disney Pixar. Cringeworthy Dialogues, Bad Ass People being made absolutely ridiciolous by what they say and how they act. Knight of Ren with their screentime of 10 Seconds are still left unexplained and served no purpose to the story. Everyone all of a sudden has Magic abilities to heal everyone and suck life force out. It feels like a child who didn't know star wars wrote the script. Added some new Merch products to it like the new droid and that's it.",0

What is the message of this trilogy if the only Skywalker remaining, Ben Solo, is killed after he has proven he has abandoned the dark side of the force. What JJ did with this characters is cruel: killing them when they finally come to a state of happiness, isolating them after all they've wanted is belonging, COMPLETELY ERASING THEM (Hux and Rose)... I won't say there weren't enjoyable moments, some of the were extremely moving (Han Solo and Kylo Ren's interaction) and of course Kylo Ren and Rey's relationship is very interesting; but overall this movie had so many plot holes and the treatment it gave to its characters was so violent that it's hard to feel happy after watching it.",1

Her identifying as a Skywalker shows her moving on from the past and embracing the future, which I think s the main theme of the sequel trilogy. Han, Luke, Leia, and Ben all connected with her in different ways. Seeing Luke and Leia smile upon Rey as she confidently says that she is a Skywalker leaves me in tears.",1

4915,7.0,"First let me say that, like all Star Wars movies, I enjoyed this movie while watching it and was on my Star Wars high immediately after seeing it. ""Star Wars High"" is that great feeling you get after watching a Star Wars movie that allows you to ignore all the ""fridge logic"" that will make you question whether the movie was actually good or not after seeing it. If you don't know what ""fridge logic"" is, just google the term, you'll laugh. Star Wars movies have always had a lot of fridge logic, but episodes 8 and 9 were particularly bad when it came to plot holes, unanswered questions and things that just didn't make sense.",1
4916,9.0,"Just got out of the Thursday night premiere which my 17 year old daughter kindly accompanied me to (to spare my wife). We both thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Went in expecting a typical Star Wars flick and this delivered the goods. Familiar heroes against dire odds, still casually cracking the odd joke? Check. Epic light-saber battles and force demonstrations? Check. Jedi/Dark-side character dilemmas? check. Occasional tugging of the heart strings? check. They did a pretty good job tying up the loose ends here, to a pretty epic finale. I was truly surprised by a few moments as well, having only moderately checked out news up to the premier.",1

4919,7.0,It was way too much for one movie and went too far. From one point it is a damage limitation from TLJ (I don't think even Rian Johnson could continue that movie) as JJ couldn't finish the journey he visioned with TFA.,0
4920,5.0,"This film seems to play it very safe. Disney could have taken more time doing his movie. It feels rushed, there are very few scenes that are memorable, but it's not the worst like some people seem to say. It's bland, but not infuriating. Visual effects are as usual, nothing mind blowing. The acting is pretty good and probably the best part of the movie. The pacing does feel all over the place. There are some characters who were wasted opportunities. I wished they concluded this movie better but, eh, it could've been worse. It's a one time watch, watch it if you want to conclude the sequel trilogy.",0
4921,10.0,Those who have wide imagination and respect energy and love will love it.,1
4922,6.0,This feels like they tried to cram a whole bunch in at the last minute. the scenes with Leia felt off obviously and i would've probably liked an off screen death better than whatever scraps they pieced together. certain character developments were rushed with little to no build up.,0

It just seems a lot of money has gone into creating a B grade film that just makes you cringe througgout. The themes are literally slapped together and it emds up second rate and corny. Disappointing to say the least. Someone with a fresh vision needs to reboot this franchise. If that doesn't work, let it die.",0

4926,6.0,"Star Wars Episode 9 had a lot to overcome. The Last Jedi didn't advance the story all too much, so this movie had to act as both a second movie and a final movie in this trilogy.

Last year the projection of snoke was defeated and now this year a bigger projection appears. What's next ghost of dathmall returning. Palpatine could not return due to ending of R.T.T.J and every true starwars fan knows it.",0
4929,6.0,Star Wars: The rise of skywalker was a clunky yet satisfying end to the Skywalker saga. The movie was overall well rounded yet it felt corny and lack dramatic flair in some parts. The visuals of this movie are just as good as any Star Wars movie especially during a certain confrontation in the movie and while some areas lacked in tension others shined and showed you what a true Star Wars movie is by keeping you at the edge of your seat. Certain characters developments felt stagnated and boring as the movie progressed and a lot of actions and storyline's felt like no more than fan service. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone even though I've seemed negative it truly is a wonderful film,1

The name of the movie has nothing with the movie, Kylo turning to the good side is ok and than Palp took him, throw him and say something like ""That is how dies the last Skywalker"" which is ok and than I was thinking that he would rise and kill Palp (that would be better) and it completes with the title but then Rey heard the voices and she is the all of jedi stollen from Endgame, but that is ok and than that kiss and let Rey live and she took Skywalker name is dumb!

4938,8.0,The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting ending to the Star Wars series has compelling emotional scenes and wraps up pressing questions from the trilogy. The action scenes and battles make the film breeze by and the acting is top notch.,1
4939,6.0,The special effect were decent and for that i gave it a 6. The acting was terrible and the plot makes little sense. Corny one liners and yuk yuks abound. Nothing really makes sense. Did anyone actually watch the original first three movies??? Wach it just to see how dumb it is. Count how many times they Rube Goldberg some plan. Ren chases Rey around only to let her simply walk away. I think we all got punked by JJ on this one,0
4940,6.0,"For the first 1 hour 30 minutes, the director indulges all of his worst trademarks as a filmmaker - absolutely hectic dialogue where everyone talks over each other, barely giving you time to register anything like an authentic feeling, frantic action with no emotional authenticity. He toned it down for The Force Awakens, actually allowing landscapes and scenes to show their beauty, but there is no restraint what so ever here.",0
4941,10.0,"As I lifelong fan of Star Wars I was very pleased with this movie. It tied up everything nicely, had some wonderful moments that pay homage to the original trilogy and most importantly it was fun!<br /><br />Over the years I have loved the books and comics that followed the characters after ROTJ and I can sympathise to a degree with those who were disappointed with the way this trilogy went, however the newer characters have been a great addition to Star Wars and it was a greatly satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.<br /><br />Those of you who managed to hold on to your sense of wonder will probably enjoy it as much as I did.",1
4942,8.0,Last night was an adventure. Got to the theater to see the movie in IMAX. Well the computer for IMAX didn't work. 😢So I go back to the box office and receive a free ticket for this movie and more free stuff. 😱. So this iconic movie franchise comes to a end. Star Wars Rise of Skywalker . SPOILERS. This movie was a fun & emotional ride for me. Been a long ride since 1977. The storyline was fun and entertaining.The story was of how Rey is a Palatine was epic. The powers she has was something else.,1
4943,10.0,Personally I thought everything ended perfectly. It was all I wanted and more. All the Easter eggs are very fitting but the overall movie as a whole just has everything you want. I loved last jedi and rank it number 3 all time. I put Rise of Skywalker at number 2 only behind Empire Strikes Back. I highly recommend,1

4949,1.0,"Literally, the galactic saga became a joke by misguided feminism. This movie made me feel really uncomfortable while watching it.<br /><br />Star destroyer was a hunk with giant male symbolic planet destroying weapon underneath the vessel and all the rebels gathered to destroy the weapons.<br /><br />Disney writers were busy sending out the message that old male masculinity which messed up the galaxy now finds unity in rebellion through Princess Leia's leadership and Rey fulfills the peace... and taking Skywalker name in the end.. what???<br /><br />I just felt that this whole franchise of this last trilogy seemed like a giant propaganda of feminism.<br /><br />Do they really have to ruin the series like this???<br /><br />They had to sneak in a lesbo scene in the victory celebration scenes.<br /><br />There was take back in time scene where Leia beats Luke in force saber training scene. What???<br /><br />There is a reason why Luke's name is Luke. In Greek Latin, it means ""light"" or ""hope"". Hence the chosen one.<br /><br />It was heart breaking to deny this whole plot and made Rey as the final solution in this Galactic Saga's ending. Wrong wrong wrong...<br /><br />then why Jedi council misinterpreted that Anakin was the chosen one to destroy the sithlord? Because he does when Luke faces the emperor and Anakin kills him.<br /><br />Then all of sudden Rey comes... who is a clone of an emperor, no relation to Skywalker family... the story kills all Skywalker bloodlines... what???<br /><br />So wrong all the way... pity all the great graphics works go waste on this poor plots...<br /><br />Mr George Lucas... what were you thinking? How did you approve all these misguided messages??",0
4950,4.0,"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is directed by J. J. Abrams and is the final film in the Skywalker Saga. I think every Star Wars fan was really worried when walking into this film. You can't deny The Last Jedi messed up a lot of the plans which were set up in The Force Awakens, so J. J Abrams spends a lot of time in this movie reintroducing all the mysteries that were previously shut down. And because of this, the film feels like an absolute mess. I have many problems with this movie and I feel like Disney hoped the spectacle would distract from the fact that the entire plot is so illogical. The fact that they decided to bring back Emperor Palpatine completely undermines the arc of Darth Vader/ Anakin Skywalker. This character, who was seen as irreddemable, saved his son by killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. If you watch from Episode I, you see this arc span over 6 films, so that climax is the most integral moment of the entire saga... But no, Palpatine is somehow alive and we are given no explanation as to how. This bad writing is also seen with our main heroes. I haven't seen any depth, growth or characterisation from Fin and Poe since the first film. And waiting until the till the 3rd movie to give Rey some kind of backstory makes no sense. I could not bring myself to care about her character. The revelation of her secret backstory feels so forced. She is so overpowered and we never actually see her learn or get taught anything. It's so clear that there was no plan for this trilogy. The lack of cohesion between these movies makes me look back at films I previously loved, like The Force Awakens and see it as an empty set up. They tried to save this movie with excessive CGI and action scenes. The climax felt like something out of a marvel movie. It didn't feel like Star Wars to me. The movie felt like it could have been directed by anyone, and to me that's my biggest issue. It feels like it was made by the Disney Robot. Star Wars is a lot more than just big action spectacles. This entire trilogy is a tragic mess. It's even confirmed by the title which to me has nothing to do with the story.",0
4951,1.0,"I went to see it despite the bad views and i belive it is better than 1,2,7 and 8 and alltogether is a great watch.",0
4952,8.0,It was a good film not the best and certainly not the flop that all the haters are saying. Guys Lucas films was sold to Disney. Get over it and get a life soon.,1
4953,3.0,Sure not a 1/10 movie but giving this anything over 5 is insane.<br /><br />It had cool moments and was enjoyable but its not worth a star wars title imo.<br /><br />Sadly its still better then the last one tho,1
4954,10.0,"The Rise of Skywalker directed by J.J. abrams was a good end to the star wars movies. Although they did some good things and I enjoyed the majority of it the movie, I didn't like some of the new characters such as Finn and Poe.

4956,9.0,"Extrapolating from my own psychology, we tend to think that females are something 'less than' males. That is why I was delighted to see that Rey's heroic journey was merely into space and the events therein, subverting the outmoded cliche of having a relatively weak moral character being shaped over time into heroism. To contrast, Luke Skywalker began as a headstrong yet timid-in-action flyover hick that ended up destroying the first Death Star by learning to listen to the feminine force. It can be argued that despite his ascension within the Rebel hierarchy that he always remained that which he began as; we cannot simply forget a person's history. But by having Rey begin as a self-confident, assertive, compassionate, and skilled young woman, the filmmakers immediately set the tone that this character is already a hero and needs no 'improvement'--as a judging father figure would expect to be necessary.",0
4957,10.0,"The fan service was amazing ! It did cover up some mistakes of TLJ and kinda fixed things. There are still some wrong moments but the good ones are much more satisfying.

4963,8.0,I'm offended by all of the terrible reviews coming from people who gave The Last Jedi so much praise. That movie destroyed any basis of a plot set up by The Force Awakens.

4964,2.0,"Starwars: The Rise of Skywalker may be the most horribly acted, written, directed, and disrespectful film to fans of the franchise in the last decade.

Lucas and it has gone down the pipe with Disney, i'm just going to ask one question. Why Disney ?",0

These last 3 were good, wtf and fantastic- in order of episode not including 4,5 & 6. They fleshed it out. They had answered most if not all pertinent questions. There was real emotion and it wasn't forced. Im hoping for 2 opposite outcomes at the same time.

4972,4.0,"It was 1983 8 years old and my father brought me to the movies. The last Jedi. Every time we were renting movies I always got to pick one movie. And everytime it was a new hope or the empire strikes back (last one was my favorite because of the AT-AT's scenes). I was amazed with return of the jedi. What a good ending. Later i discovered there were to be 9 movies. I bought the orinally trioligy in my teens about 3 times on dvd because Lucas added every time many stuff and they said the old movies would not come back again. Years later as an adult i watched 3 movies who where made for children. I thought this was not the SW i saw as a child and rejected these movies. Then they made the new 3. Saw the first one in on screen. It was ok but needed more, i was not sold. The second one i watched online, was never happy with it. Only one scene of the you all know wich one stormtrooper against Finn was a nice scene. That was a cool stormtrooper.",1
4973,4.0,Just seen this with my son's 8 and 10. They both loved the film and said it was the best of the sequels. However to me it felt like they had to correct the mistakes from episode 8 but once that was over it became its own film. There are bits in it that as a star wars fan meant a lot to me and disney did well with the pressure of the fans. Really need to see again and enjoy it for a second time.,1
4974,6.0,This movie had the impossible job to unite a divided fanbase and conclude a saga in one movie. For the most part the movie did a good job introducing new ideas and twisting the story fans expect into something different that still feels satisfying.,1

4976,7.0,"I actually think this is the strongest one of the sequel films, mainly because they focus on The Gang, aka Rey, Finn, Poe, and of course the droids and Chewie. I'm very happy that 3PO got a larger role in this one! The first part of the movie was very good. Leia trained Rey! That made me so happy, as neither of the two other movies focused on Leia as a Jedi at all. The last part of the movie is a bit of a dumpsterfire (let Palpatine stay dead, for heavens sake), but I liked the scene where Kylo sacrificed himself for Rey, and the very last scene where Rey takes on the name of Skywalker. It was very fitting. I'm also glad we got to see Luke again after the travesty that was The Last Jedi. It sorta feels like this movie leads up to more, in which case I hope they have a more coherent plot in mind because the sequel trilogy on a whole really suffers from rehashing old scenes from the original trilogy. I get that they want to evoke nostalgia but did they have to literally bring the whole galaxy back to square one to do that? (At least they didn't bring back a fourth Death Star...) On a whole the sequels didn't accomplish anything that haven't been done before, but I would have liked to follow these characters on new adventures if they were handled more consistently and got to exist on their own terms outside of the shadow of the original trilogy.",1
4977,10.0,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was a wonderful ending that ties in a lot of deep lore. JJ really has to scrap almost everyone from The Last Jedi, and that was really hard, but he did it.

There were a few things I wasnt a big fan of, but all in all, JJ did an incredible job.",1
4978,4.0,"Every death that we thought was meaningful either didn't happen or doesn't matter. Be a Jedi or Sith, significant characters continue their influence in the afterlife - with no explanation given. Rey and Kylo's relationship is first stilted, then forced. Ancillary characters are not advanced from Episode 8. Even the landscapes - which have reliably added allure - are underutilized. The Rise of Skywalker doesn't mesh with The Last Jedi, as most fans had anticipated. But beyond that, the ending of Episode 9 caps off a jumbled, conflicted story where triviality is all that is left.",0
4979,8.0,"For the end of this Trilogy, Daisy and Adam are real great again for this outing.But, I'm in the minority that liked The Last Jedi. They do retcon sections from the last film, and add a good amount fanservice. Still has scenes that similar to Return of the Jedi. The Rey twist didn't quite work upon further reflection because it undercut what was established The Last Jedi. The pacing could have been better. The climax battle was still pretty awesome. My hope for the new Trilogy in 2022 is that they have a more cohesive vision for those Episodic movies. Some of this JJ Abrams of what isn't good at for his screenplays.",1
4980,2.0,"After GoT you get this? Don't know what is worse. It was like a parody film. All cinema was laughing at "" hartbreaking"" scenes becouse they where so bad. Hope they don't try to do any new movies. Disney destroyed Star wars!",0

4982,10.0,"I commend J.J. Abrams for his noble efforts at rehabilitating the nightmarish trash heap that was The Last Jedi. While the ending was not everything I'd hoped, this movie really is a love letter to the Star Wars fans who were heartbroken by Rian Johnson's attempt to subvert expectations with cheap jokes, character assassinations, and meaningless plot twists. The Rise of Skywalker made we wish that J.J. Abrams had written and directed the whole trilogy. I give this movie ten for both the tremendous efforts of J.J., the great acting, and about 99% of the storytelling. It would be a perfect ending if the ending were tweaked slightly, but that is a personal opinion. I highly recommend this movie, though.",1

4999,5.0,"If you are a core Star Wars fan the only way to enjoy this movie is to significantly lower your expectations and think you're going to have good time seeing just another action/sci-fi flick, not the conclusion of the SW saga. The movie is for kids/new audiences that like cgi but there's nothing outstanding with cgi on this movie and the action scenes are average. As for the rest... I don't like to be negative but man... what a mess! No good story, hollow characters and a lot of nonsense...the force can now teleport stuff and can cure any injury and even revive people, there are people running/fighting on top of spaceships in open space, characters get clearly killed to then appear alive and so on and on. As I said, if you want to have a good time watching this movie, predisposed yourself to be positive no matter what.",0
5000,,"I would honestly give this movie around an 8/10 but because of all the unfair low ratings I rated it higher.<br /><br />First thing to understand is that this movie has a lot of pressure and heavy lifting to do, including concluding the new trilogy, concluding the Skywalker saga as a whole, and bringing the momentum of the story back after ""The Last Jedi"" slowed it down significantly. I will say though, the overall problem with the trilogy is that the story, I have to assume, was not clearly written from the beginning, hence why the change of directors had an awkward shift and we were got to see two different versions of a story at the same time, which was not pleasant.<br /><br />However, here are the positives and negatives of this movie, ""The Rise of Skywalker.""",0
5001,2.0,So lemmings run and pay and watch... but without the 'Star Wars' logo this third-rate film with the bad acting would not even be straight-to-video. It would be straight-to-Mystery Science 3000!,0
5002,10.0,"I was born in 1977, grew up with Star Wars, and it's always been one of my favorites. I didn't love the prequels, but was able to overlook Jar Jar, and enjoyed the choreography. I didn't like the politics side, nor the third movie, in the prequel but those movies were ok. The first in this new series I thought was great, but the second was garbage. In other words, I'm not a pedantic Star Wars fan but I have my limits.",1
5003,10.0,A lot of the reviews are really hard to understand because it seems that self proclaimed Starwars dont like Starwars. The movie was actually quite good full of action but had moments that were emotional and funny. The people who give this one star just aren't starwars fans.,1
5004,6.0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I've always been a ""Star Wars"" fan: the original movie from 1977 changed my life, and I've seen ""The Empire Strikes Back"" more times than any other film. While I didn't always like the movies that followed, I still dedicated my time to seeing them because I love the mythology that George Lucas created.",1
5005,1.0,This movie is really really bad.<br /><br />Your life only last one lifetime. Don't waste it on this movie.,0
5006,6.0,So I like how this movie ties up loose ends from the entire trilogy. This movie has received a lot of hate recently and yeah I can see its flaws and while it is my least favourite of the trilogy I still like it.,0
5007,10.0,A brilliant finish to an amazing series. Tied things together nicely.,1
5008,1.0,It was pretty good...,1
5009,8.0,"So the critics are nuts. This was actually one of the best Star wars movies apart from the OT. Is it fast paced? Yes. Did JJ have to work miracles? Pretty much... He delivers. This brought back all the feels, emotions, imagery, comedy, adventure, high stakes, thrills and sacrifices you want to see in a SW film. We all have opinions, this is mine. It was a fantastic ride. I don't ever cry during movies. I cried 3 times. Lol. Thank you JJ!",1
5010,7.0,"""The Rise of Skywalker"" is far and away the best of the new Star Wars trilogy. That being said, the bar was set so low, that nearly anything would be a decided improvement. TRoS feels like a halfhearted penance to the diehard fans for the sins of the last two films. Instead of trying to piece together the convoluted mess Disney had created, the writers ignore everything that has just happened. They rely instead on a storyline compiled completely of fan service to the original 6 films. It seems as though Disney decided to make 3 new Star Wars films without any forethought as to where to take the story. For example, Who was Snoke? Who knows .. who cares .. because apparently he doesn't matter anyway to the overall story .. Why spend all the time creating a character that has no ultimate relevance to the overarching storyline. Instead of fixing or trying to explain what they had in mind, they instead pull out an old reliable villain in an attempt to make us all believe they had planned this all along. Sorry, not sorry Disney, no one buys that.",0
5011,10.0,"No matter what the outcome of this movie is, fans are always going to be divisive. Fans need to learn to accept things. Best in the trilogy and a great way to end the saga. Palpatine OP as hell. Hats off to JJ. I have spoken.",1
5012,8.0,"I have watched every Star Wars movie.I disliked the prequels, Enjoyed the last two as well as this one. I read the reviews and almost skipped this one , But I had to judge it myself and there are lots of surprises and twists.im not giving out any spoilers because it is meant to be a surprise.Its nice to see Carrie Fisher return briefly as well as a ghost of Luke Skywalker and. Some other important past characters. Great special effects. And have to say in the capable hands of Disney they did very well giving closure to the series in a brilliant way.Give JJ Abrams dome credit for doing a great job. What was a surprise to me was no one in the theater talked or seemed to play with their cell phones. But did clap at the end.I give this epic 8 out of 10 . Of course my favorites are the originals a new hope and empire strikes back.",1
5013,9.0,"We get it. Everyone loves ""Star Wars"", and it's the pinnacle of their childhood; inspiring, wonderous, and a deeply impactful tale of redemption and courage. When we were allowed 3 chapters of this story, we clamored for more. When the creator told us we hadnt even begun to hear the beginning of the tale, we graciously waited and listened, and promptly turned on the man because we didnt like the way he told his story, and it was certainly not the way ""we"" would tell it. What followed was intense scrutiny, backlash, and ridicule of the man, his story, and his choices. So he happily signed away the story to someone who might just keep the story going, and make it something we can all enjoy as he clearly ""failed"" us.",1
5014,8.0,Couldn't ask for anything better except for maybe 15 or 25 more minutes of content but for what we got couldn't have been better.,0
5015,1.0,"I honestly don't have the time or energy to list everything that is wrong with this film. Before you go into this just realise you'll spend most of the film rolling your eyes, sighing in sadness or pausing the film as you try to figure out what the hell is going on. This film shows why JJ should not be allowed near a big budget franchise. There are literally no redeeming moments in this film. You want to get a good Star Wars fix watch The Clone Wars or Rebels TV shows.",0
5016,8.0,"I'm a teenage female fan and I thought this movie was great. Was it the perfect ending, no. But I still really enjoyed the movie.",1
5017,8.0,"First of all, I'm not sure what those who claim they saw the movie and gave it terrible reviews based on resentment, what are really trying to do. They obviously didn't see the movie and have no business commenting the movie. If you did see it, fine, but the purpose of commenting on the movie is to give an honest option, not some built up resentment against anything others enjoy. Grow up, will yah.",0
5018,6.0,"Some of the reviews are a little extreme. It's not a great film, but it's not bad. It's probably not a good film. It's certainly at least okay.",1
5019,4.0,A spoiler-heavy review lay before you with a proper dose of ambiguity just in case you'd actually like to be talked out of seeing STAR WARS Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.,0
5020,9.0,"I sincerely enjoyed this film from start to finish. Entertaining, engaging, beautifully staged, film-craft at the cutting edge of what is possible. The story and character lines felt very satisfying and emotionally grounded within the fantastical world(s) and atmosphere we've come to expect and enjoy from the Star Wars movies.",1
5021,7.0,"I gave it a 7/10 because Kylo/ Ben dies, and his mom, Leia. Plus John Boyega was yelling the whole movie. But it was a solid good ending-ish, some questions here and there.",1
5022,10.0,"I felt that the use of several elements in the Star Wars universe. Like when busting out Chewy in stormtrooper prison. And the return of triangular star destroyer planet killer ships. Ray being a Paliptine fits, she has a feel for the force that ""was always there"" and had a natural both draw to the dark side as well as a good fighter with a stick (lightsaber). Both Ray and Ben were on the wrong Diode sides yet they were drawn together but had Opposing hearts. Ray was a Palpitine but had Leah's good heart and was a good mother. Ben also had an opposing heart. He had a good upbringing but a bad direction by Luke and anger tendency. I felt the Xicule scenes with Palpitine unmoving in a good way.",1
5023,8.0,"This was an enjoyable film and I dont care what people say. It was a bit rushed at times and some of the things they came up with were a bit unexplained and I feel like they should have mentioned them earlier in the trilogy (e.gLeia having trained to fight like a jedi). I found the best way to watch this film is to watch it not thinking to much about the previous two and it becomes quite enjoyable. The story line I actually felt was good, everybody keeps saying it was a to similar to the return of the jedi but I felt that was one of the reasons why it worked for me.",1
5024,9.0,This had to be one of the toughest things to do for JJ so I give him the utmost respect. This movie was fun entertaining and allowed me to now watch the last Jedi and not be so upset. People who are calling this fan fare I say why the hell not!? You will walk out a satisfied Star Wars fan. JJ has brought balance back to the force. Go into this movie open minded and ready to have fun. Enjoy.,1
5025,8.0,"As a lifelong Star Wars tragic, I really enjoyed the movie. I had very low expectations, as I despised TLJ, but it was really enjoyable and a fitting conclusion.",1
5026,10.0,"The critics must be crazy and you people giving this low ratings definitely are. This movie was fantastic. I bet half the people reviewing negatively haven't seen it. Star Wars was never for the fans. It was a brilliant world from George Lucas that brought us somewhere completely new and original. Star Wars was never for the fans, so when ""fans"" say something should have happened or this doesn't work like that, they're wrong. Gonna be honest, it's not their story. It's not your story so get over yourself. Write a fanfic if you want. JJ Abrams wrapped it all up. Great job.",1
5027,6.0,It's not a bad movie by any means its a blast and nice mix of old and new movies I love the gems they have in the movie and call backs as well as the metaphors but to get the gems and visual callbacks you must and I mean you must look at the other star wars movies to fully understand the plot twist was a jaw dropping wall breaker but the movie felt rush I know its 2 hours and nearly 30 Minutes long but they seriously should have add 30 mins of film in this movie to some this up for kids or people who are new to the star wars things this movie has the emotional pull of Avengers Infinity War and the action of avengers end game star wars plug perfect balance lol the end of movie is what really throws everything up I put it like this if you follow emlight Shyamalan movies with Unbreakable glass that feel of why do that if you just going to kill someone off is pointless. Soooooo all & all put it like this I think they would have been da amazing couple put the end of the movie just left me empty wanting more and questioning things love the movie hate the ending.,1

5029,8.0,Star Wars has been in my entire life.,0
5030,8.0,Ignore all of the terrible reviews the movie is being bombarded with and don't let them make up your mind.<br /><br />I went to see the 12:01am session so I was not influenced by any reviews (negative or positive) before seeing it.,0
5031,7.0,"What did you want to see in this movie?<br /><br />Answers to Rey's parentage? Lightsaber battles? Spaceship battles? Ground war like in Rogue One? New characters? Old Characters? Locations and ""World building""? Reylo? Finn? Poe? Less Rose? Droids? Bendemption? A Leia death scene? A villain with a history?",1
5032,9.0,"I went this morning to see Star Wars Ep. IX: The Rise of Skywalker and I have this to say:<br /><br />THAT....is how you cap a saga that has been going for over 42 years, since May 25, 1977, the release date of Star Wars: Ep. IV: A New Hope. JJ Abrams hit this one out of the park. He and Rian Johnson, should be so proud! This final chapter is a masterpiece! I am going to share my thoughts on why this is the case but I need to preface my arguments with some background.<br /><br />I was born just shy of 3 years after ""A New Hope"" was released, so Star Wars has been a part of the fabric of my life since the beginning. I have loved Star Wars since I was a child, and I have watched just about every Star Wars movie, spin off, and TV show since this then. In doing so, please consider that many of my thoughts are going to include connections to Star Wars canon outside of the 8 movies leading to Ep.9.<br /><br />As the lights went on at the end of my viewing today, and I was scraping my jaw off the floor, I was reasoning things out, and admittedly, I can only think of one, minor loose end, that was never explained. More on that later. Now to understand my thoughts and theories, you need to have seen Ep. 1-9, and the animated ""Clone Wars"" that ran on Cartoon Network from October 2008 to March 2014. This is why I think there is such brilliance to this capstone episode to the Skywalker saga.<br /><br />*Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />1. How is Palpatine still alive?<br /><br />At the close of Ep. 6, we see Darth Vader pick up the Emperor, and throw him down a chasm in the Death Star. That should have killed him right? To start we need to go to Ep.3, when Anakin is speaking to Senator Palpatine in that light concert on Coruscant. There Palpatine introduces that he knows some history behind the Force, namely the Dark Side, and speaks of Darth Plagueis, a Sith Lord who had tapped into ""immortality"" but was killed by his unnamed apprentice (Palpatine). Palpatine uses this to entice Anakin, considering his love and concern about Padme. We know that he ultimately denies Anakin this knowledge. It is inferred, by Palpatine's appearance in Ep. 9, that he had mastered long life, as pursued by Plagueis, before his death at Palpatine's hand.<br /><br />2. How did Palpatine stay hidden for so long?<br /><br />When Kylo Ren seeks out Palpatine, and finds him on Exegol, I was drawn to S.3:Ep. 15 of the ""Clone Wars"" where Anakin, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano are drawn to a planet, hidden from the Jedi, called Mortis. This planet, which was home to three VERY powerful force beings, The Father, The Daughter, and The Son. Obi Wan asks how this planet, so rich in the Force, is unknown to the Jedi. We know from Ep. I that a darkness has settled over the force, at the hand of Palpatine, which was already at hand when the first episode begins, ""clouding"" the Force. This is one theory. At this time, when the Jedi are taken to Mortis, the Clone Wars are in full force, so it is safe to bet that Palpatine, who we now know is VERY powerful, has hid its presence. By Ep. 17, the only residents of Mortis are dead. Without residents, he renames Mortis Exegol. Exegol, like Mortis, was not on any map. When Kylo leaves his ship, and meets with Palpatine, the planet looks much like Mortis. The other theory is that Mortis is simply a place that hides the Force This would explain how Palpatine was hidden long enough to build a following and an armada of ships to make up the Final Order.",1
5033,4.0,This movie did not get me thinking deeply. The plot was simple and predictable. The story did not leave any room for imagination. The dialogue was overt and uninspired.,0
5034,10.0,"Leave it to JJ to do a great job bringing the whole series to a close. With the exception of one thing at the end, I think it all really worked well and loved all the characters he had in this movie.",1
5035,8.0,Cannot believe the negativity on here..not a perfect film and a few cringe moments but it was fun..difficult job to tie up loose ends because of of the plot direction of the last episode but I enjoyed it...,1
5036,1.0,"This is my first review ever, I just needed to warn you: please no not waste time on this movie. I am a huge Star Wars fan, I like everything Star Wars made. But this movie just crossed the line.<br /><br />From the beginning it felt like a different movie: the force could do things we never saw before in all the Star Wars universe! They are running all the time, I've lost count on how many planets they were or all that was needed to fulfill Rey's destiny. The lines were so cheesy I almost felt sorry for the actors.<br /><br />I'm really angry at Disney, the series are pretty good, Rogue One was awesome! But this? It was just too much. It does not deserve to be cannon.",0
5037,10.0,"This was such a good movie. I enjoyed it immensely. It has all of the themes that you've come to expect from the Star Wars series: friendship, redemption, and hope.",1
5038,2.0,"I enjoyed the ""The Force Awakens"" (I know it was just a rip off of the original but it was enjoyable For me), I thought ""The Last Jedi"" was absolutely horrible, and was hoping to be pleasantly surprised here with Abrams being back in charge...",1
5039,7.0,I have given 10 out of 10 to every Star Wars movie but here comes the saying.. there is always the first time.,0
5040,4.0,"It met my expectations, in every shape and form! The trailers really helped build up my expectations! I would watch this anime for days on end, and I would never get bored!",0
5041,9.0,My family and I very much enjoyed the movie. Great film,1
5042,5.0,"The first genuinely forgettable Star Wars film. I honestly barely remember anything that happened in this. I remember finding a decent number of scenes to be dumb, like Palpatine being back, Rey jumping over Ren's ship, horses running on top of a spaceship, and another version of the Death Star. Another problem is that this film cemented the fact that these are just reimaginings of the original trilogy, each film were basically structured like the original films. Now, I wasn't able to watch the whole film as the final battle is seizure inducing for an epileptic like me, so I had to listen to the whole thing and wasn't able to see much (except for the very beginning of the battle and when I heard something that I had to see, but that was rather rare).",0
5043,7.0,Had the feeling that was more of a merchandising gimmic than an actual movie.<br /><br />Characters are not expored enough and instead is a push of new droids and aliens so as to sell more. Story in the beginning was predictable and got better towards the end with some plot twists.,0
5044,4.0,"Anakin Skywalker's history! No, Rey ""Skywalker""'s history!",1
5045,9.0,"Really, the only way this could have ended. Satisfying",0
5046,6.0,"This was a rare swing and a miss for JJ Abrams, though one cannot place all the blame on him. The main reason that this movie was such a mess was this: too many characters.<br /><br />Not only did ALL of the main characters from the original three movies get brought back during episodes 7-9, you had the introduction of at least six new main characters, and over ten minor ones. JJ appears to have tried to give all of them screen time, with limited success. Another huge problem was that half of the new main characters were utterly forgettable. I'll be honest, if Poe and Finn had been killed off in the first movie, no one would have cared; or at the very least they should have been relegated to background roles. BB-8 was an absurd concept, and what the hell was Keri Russell's character and the scene with the horses even doing there?<br /><br />Kylo and Rey were both done very well in all three films, and a few of the new characters like Rose Tico were done well, but there were so many characters in 7-9, and especially 9, that focus on the real story (the Kylo-Rey conflict) almost got lost.<br /><br />The end result was a major mess, punctuated by short periods of great film making.<br /><br />The final scene for Carrie Fisher was good, though a little forced, the final scene for Harrison Ford was well done, the final battle and conclusion of the Kylo-Rey conflict was poignant and fitting, and the last scene for Rey was emotional. Abrams should have expanded on those parts of the story and eliminated the entire Poe and Finn parts. In fact, you could expand that statement to all three of the last films.",0
5047,9.0,"When I left the theaters after watching this movie for the first time I wasn't sure what to feel. I thought it was a good movie but there were just some things bugging me. Ben's death felt very unnecessary and the absence of Anakin Skywalker felt extremely weird. Sure, you can hear his voice when all the jedi are speaking to Rey, but if this is really the end of the Skywalker saga then he should've been given more screen time. Just him appearing as a force ghost for a few seconds would've been enough and much more natural since this actually is a saga about the Skywalkers.",0
5048,7.0,"This is another episode of Disney being in love with our money. They don't care about the story, character development or the legacy. I'm a fan, i don't hate this movie but i'm sure that i will never rewatch this one or the last two. It bored me, Rey being perfect in everything (don't get me wrong, i like very much Ashoka but there was development ), Finn ??? , Poe is there and that's all. I liked Kylo, he was ok. Luke, Leia and Han were all jokes. Especially Luke in TLJ ( such an ugly movie )<br /><br />Sorry guys, i think much more time must pass, so we can HOPE one day we will get another good star wars movie",0
5049,7.0,I actually liked watching this movie. Sure there are some plot holes and this movie could have taken a couple more risks. Thankfully the characters feel more flushed out and the story was fast paced. Overall it feels like an ending to the series and I will always look fondly to this trilogy.,1
5050,4.0,Disney has ruined star wars. I couldn't find much I liked about this film,1
5051,6.0,"Rise of Skywalker was slightly better than I expected based on this user review section, which isn't saying much. The pacing is completely off, and there are some questionable choices throughout - overall it was a satisfying enough conclusion to this new trilogy. But ultimately this whole trilogy felt a bit pointless.",0
5052,7.0,"Yes this movie is not Empire Strikes Back. But it is far from being as bad as Attack of The Clones. Yes the story is kind of all over the place (especially the 1st act, it all moved so fast) and there are holes in the story. I won't lie, some of this movie tries to retcon some of The Last Jedi, with a character that is not a spoiler anymore because he's in the trailers and posters, The Emperor. I feel JJ Abrams threw in the Emperor in this movie from the hate received by fans from The Last Jedi. It's hard to review this movie without giving spoilers. So to keep it short, I enjoyed watching this movie. I think it's a good ending to this Saga and by far, I mean by far! Kylo Ren is the best character out of this whole Trilogy. Adam Driver yet again is great as this character. Also don't listen to others reviews, go and watch the movie yourself, and judge it yourself.",1
5053,5.0,I never thought Id say this about star wars. This isn't a good movie it just tries to pull at your strings through fan service. Better than TLJ is not good. We deserve better than mediocrity for star wars...we deserve good,1
5054,4.0,"When I first watched this back in December, I thought it was much better than The Last Jedi. On the face of it, I still think it's a more entertaining film than its predecessor. But I've come to realise that The Last Jedi did actually do something that I didn't think Disney were brave enough to do - it took the story in an unexpected direction. Don't get me wrong, the Canto Bight story thread is appalling and Luke dying because he's used up his energy, force projecting himself, instead just going to Crate and dying for real, just sucks ass. But Rey discovering she is nobody and Kylo killing Snoke and becoming Supreme Leader was the right choice by Rian Johnson. And if Episode 9 had followed this story through, it would have been the epic conclusion we all wanted, and I strongly believe it would have made some of TLJ haters change their minds. Episode 9 should have been about Rey having to bring down Ben Solo, but being torn because of their love for eachother, but in the end he chooses the dark side and she has to kill him. You could still have the big space battle at the end, but you did not need a Snoke replacement.",1
5055,10.0,"I've been waiting for the STAR WARS franchise to tell the story I wished would have been told in The Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi but they didn't and now I know why. I have watched all of the cannon TV shows, read books, talked with other friends and family that love STAR WARS as much as I do and this film finally makes my dreams of what SHOULD have happened, finally happen!!!",1
5056,10.0,A truly fantastic way to end the Star Wars saga. Thank you JJ. Loved it so much.,1
5057,1.0,This movie was a mess.,0
5058,7.0,"After the last Jedi I kinda had little hope for TROS but after seeing it, I just don't know. There were few parts that I liked in the film. There were parts that I Didn't like. I'm disappointed and hoped for more. The story is very bland and has palpatine brought back only to be killed off. There's no real sense of thrill and I didn't really feel engaged in it. Star Wars has changed and has no future",1
5059,9.0,"Some hectic editing aside, this movie was perfectly satisfying and enjoyable ending to the Skywalker saga. Go to the cinema and form your own opinion, don't listen to the so-called ""critics"". You can thank me later.",1
5060,2.0,"I mean, it must be a very early build of this generator as I doubt this result will please any fan. But it tries. It takes everything fans loved form Star Wars, replaces old characters with new ones and stitches it together very badly.",0
5061,9.0,"I certainly didn´t expect that much from this movie. But it had it all. I was touched, excited, special effects were brilliant ! Great acting, and a good story. All in all a good ending to the Star wars saga.",1
5062,2.0,Please surprise us. We don't want to pay to see the same movie 9 times. I'd say that 5% of the movie was fresh.,1
5063,7.0,"A fun film , a bit disappointed by it but nonetheless there is some enjoyment to be found. It consists of great acting , stunning visual effects and a beautiful score (as always) though all overshadowed by a rather weak narrative and pacing issues.",1
5064,7.0,"There is a lot of movie in these 2 and a bit hours, maybe a bit too much. The pacing is very rushed and the story has far too many gaps.",1
5065,3.0,Please excuse the poorly structured review. This Movie is just a mess and as such my thoughts are equally so. Where to start?,0
5066,3.0,Ignore any review over 5 stars.,0
5067,2.0,"You can tell the Disney/Bad Robot crew had no love or respect for the source material. The plot holes are abundant and no attempt is made to explain them.<br /><br />It becomes plainly clear that the entire sequel trilogy was made without any coherent plan, purely as a way to reboot and make money.Show me one interesting character, one pretty girl I want to fantasize about or one decent jedi or display of force and I will show you a clip of Donald Trump saying something sane.",0
5068,10.0,"Incredible action, visually very appealing and with a story which saved what there was to save after E8. I really liked it!",1
5069,10.0,"YES OKAY! I know it's not a 1977 Star Wars movie. And, somehow, luckily it is not. People have been criticising Star Wars since Ep. I screened. GET OVER IT PEOPLE. The saga is evolving, and so are the characters. The 70s-80s episodes were written in a context that has also LUCKILY evolved. The new saga and this awesome last episode are therefore written in a 2019 era AND STILL they carefully bring to surface Ep. I to VI pieces in a very respectful tribute way.",1
5070,9.0,"I'm a child of the 80s. I grew up on Star Wars and have loved the franchise all my life. Rise of Skywalker is a really great end to the saga. It's a very well told story expertly directed. If you're an OG Star Wars fan, you will love it.",1
5071,9.0,"Well I don't agree with all the negative reviews I loved it. It had all you need action, emotion, humour, twists and great CIG. People these days don't appreciate the crew and staff for the time and effort they have put into this film! It was for our entertainment.",1
5072,8.0,No matter what 1/10 reviews say rise of sky Walker is the best of this trilogy. People after Last Jedi made up their mind whatever it is Disney never gonna deliver another good Star Wars and ratings show it. You never gonna like a film if you watch it with hatred. I don't say it's a very good film there are some plot holes but it's a lot better than its predecessors. On whole I enjoyed this film after a painful last jedi mess.,0
5073,10.0,"So I take all these movies pretty seriously. In fact, I became a pop culture and Joseph Campbell fan based on the original film. I'm a sci fi geek and love our original characters and the mythological story they tell, when competent writers and directors are at the helm.",0
5074,4.0,"Well, this one hurts. It really does. Star Wars has been my lifelong obsession and joy, and the original and prequel trilogies are still items I value more than many things in this world, so I think its fair to say that I know a good Star Wars movie when I see one.",1
5075,7.0,"I don't hate any star wars movie. I thought the previous two were pretty alright. I can see what this movie was trying to do, ending this giant 9 (11 counting Rogue One and Solo) episode saga the J.J. Abrams way. Unfortunately, it failed in that department. It wasn't what I hoped for. The film just felt too short. It should have been longer to fit more plot. The opening scene should have been the end of tlj. As a matter of fact, it feels like the first half of the movie should have been episode 8 instead of tlj (as much as I like tlj).",0
5076,6.0,"I would say that this movie is okay, it has a lot of elements that I liked and a lot that I didn't. But ultimately I was entertained throughout the running time, which is more than I can say for The Last Jedi.",1
5077,9.0,Disney painted itself into a corner with the dumpster fire that was The Last Jedi. TROS isn't perfect and some characters had no reason to be there (Rose et al) but considering what there was to work with it is pretty damn good. I'll see it again.,1
5078,6.0,"I think there were 4 or 5 scenes which were noteworthy... outnumbered by many cringeworthy scenes. Often, one gimmick followed another. And when the movie occasionally seemed to be finding its legs, in comes an embarrassingly overacted Finn or Poe, killing the legitimacy of what should have been an instant classic. Dialogue was reminiscent of what Lucas would give us. Battle scenes were boring. Seriously, if the movie could be trimmed down to just the scenes with Kylo and Rey (except that extremely awkward bit towards the end), it would have been much better. Fortunately, The Mandalorian will help wash the taste of disappointment from my mouth.",0
5079,8.0,"8/10 Mostly because I can't bring my self to give a Star Wars movie a 7 lol, but it was a great finish to the series. The reason for the 8 was because I didn't feel the character development as much as I did in the original trilogy. Han, Luke & Leia and all them grew close because of the trials they went thru along the way, whereas these guys really didn't spend all that much time together throughout the 3 movies so how were they so close? I guess it was a lot of off camera stuff. I also felt like at times they were just rushing the plot to get the story thru in this final movie, but I did like it. Definitely worth a see and of course I'll be buying it when it comes out. I totally knew that was Keri Russell in the mask! I guess it was her eyes or something lol, but also loved seeing Dominick Monohan (that doesn't look right 😳😂😂) and Greg Grunberg. Bravo, Star Wars! You will be missed but will forever in my Amazon Instant Video collection, and look forward to hopefully more independent stories such as Rogue One, Solo, and the Mandalorian, all 3 of which were outstanding in my book! Bye now!",1
5080,9.0,This movie wrapped up the Star Wars saga perfectly! I applaud Disney/Lucasfilm for listening to us fans and giving us a movie that pays tribute to the Star Wars fan base!,1

5083,7.0,A near perfect end to an awesome trilogy of movies.,1
5084,10.0,Great movie with a perfect ending of the triology. The actors are good :D,1
5085,1.0,"Episode IX was just piece of crap.<br /><br />They finally killed Star Wars, Daisy and Adam are good actors,But they can't save this film.<br /><br />From the Episode VII,Lucas pictures and Disney didn't know how to continue the story.They didn't identify Rey in Episode 7, just want to test the audience's reaction.If the audience responds well, they will continue to make Rey nobody.<br /><br />But that doesn't happen.The reviews and box office of Episode 8 make Lucas and Disney nervous, So they went back to trying to please the loyal fans of Star Wars.<br /><br />But it's a dead end, The story of the episode 9 denies all the previous storylines.And shut down all possible future expansion of storylines and worldviews.<br /><br />Well done! I never saw a film Make the damage so perfect.<br /><br />The greatest fantasy of our time is dead.",0
5086,9.0,"I know it's not saying too much when I say it's an improvement from The Last Jedi. But poor JJ had a lot on his plate to fix. I think he did a great job explaining why Snoke wasn't an important character after all, I think he used Palpatine perfectly. Didn't overuse him. Didn't underuse him. It was interesting to see all these new force powers in the movie. I love how they utilized the force echo, which was used in The Fallen Order. I did have an issue with the final 15 minutes of the movie but the first 2 hours, it was epic, fun, no pointless missions like in The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens remains to be the best movie of the sequel trilogy however. 9 stars out of 10. 7 for the movie itself, 2 for giving credit to JJ for fixing what Rian Johnson broke.",0
5087,7.0,It was ok... the end just escalated quickly. Not that good but also not that bad. Cgi effects are good but the storyline was ok.,0
5088,5.0,"**** SPOILERS****<br /><br />Until today I have always considered J J Abrams to be a very competent director. He is the only one I know of who could reboot, complete with new cast ""Star Trek"" creating a great film going forward, and in spite of what some think, I believe he did a respectable job on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". But this film is a complete mess. There is not a coherent plot. As others have written, it appears that we are dumped into a 2 hour and 22 minute trailer for a blockbuster film. If someone were to ask me to tell them plot of this film, front to back I couldn't do it. Let me try: Kylo Ren finds out that Emperor Palpatine, who, at last check was dropped to his death into a bottomless reactor shaft in ""Return of the Jedi"", is seemingly alive and well, and has been in control throughout this trilogy. Now he has created a secret armada of star destroyers with enough firepower to destroy entire planets. Meanwhile Rey is on the verge of completing her Jedi training with Leia while her pals, Fin, Poe, and Chewy also learn of Palpatine's resurrection. So Rey decides to finish Jedi training later and joins Poe, Finn, Chewy, BB-8 and C3PO as they head out to find an old contact of Luke's who might know where Palpatine is located, while R2D2 stays behind with Leia. On their way they meet up find Palpatine, Lando Calrissian joins in the quest. They find a message containing a clue but C3PO can't interpret the message... his original programming forbids translation of messages scribed by the Sith. So C3PO gets his memory wiped so he can translate the message telling where to find Palpatine. Meanwhile Chewbacca gets nabbed by the bad guys and when he is being transported off the planet surface, Kylo and Rey have a force tug-o-war with Chewy's transport ship and Rey uses force lightning (a first for anyone except Palpatine). In the process the ship explodes, presumably killing Chewy. But it turns out that Chewy wasn't on the transport so he lives. And R2D2 had a backup of C3PO's memory so it gets restored.<br /><br />See what I mean, things happen one minute, then they are reversed in the next minute. And we aren't even half way through the film yet. But it doesn't get any better. Perhaps after watching ""The Rise of Skywalker"" 3 or 4 times it might come in to focus, but I'm not paying $10 each for tickets to try to figure out this film. I have read other reviews praising this film so it could be me. But believe me, 5 stars out of 5 is generosity on my behalf. This is easily the worst film of the 9 film trilogy of trilogies.",0
5089,10.0,It was an amazing movie. The first one who comes close to capturing the movie magic of the originals.,1
5090,10.0,Please ignore the negative reviews and see this movie! It was a wonderful ending to 42 years of legacy....,1
5091,8.0,This movie is really solid and well done. Everything that you think needed answered is answered. However there are some plot holes and unexplained things that happen in the movie that really can't be explained because of run time. The last movie really didn't help this one at all and didn't set any of it up which leads to this. Still in this movie we actually see character development and a good plot and it's overall a good movie. This is also a good movie for the fans so if you're here for Hollywood brainwashing junk don't come.,1
5092,2.0,"To be honest, I did not have high expectations at all, considering how bad the two earlier movies in the trilogy were. They all lack depth in story, characters and acting. I've liked many of J.J. Abrams previous productions, and have never said this, but both @Disney and J.J. Abrams should be ashamed. They've ruined the lineage of the Star Wars saga that consisted of 6 great movies.",0
5093,7.0,"IMO Episode 7 and Episode 8 are movies that are 100% copy paste, lack creativity and full of political correctness and propaganda. In many ways Episode 9 its the same but somehow with some decent acting, decent scenes in the mix, it becomes passible.<br /><br />Don't expect much of the story, nothing you could do after two full movies of digging the bottom.<br /><br />Adam Driver may be a good actor but IMO he was completely misscast for this role - he just doesnt have the vibe for it just like Arnold Schvarzeneger doesnt have the vibe for romantic comedies.<br /><br />The sceneries are great, Po or whatever is named the character of Oscar Isaak isn't as useless as before.",1
5094,10.0,"This movie is such an emotional roller coaster filled with non-stop action, shocking revelations, laughs, and an ultimately satisfying conclusion. Big thanks to JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio for sticking the landing on arguably the hardest task ever, closing the Skywalker Saga that spans over 40+ years with little time. This movie does not deserve the hate it gets. It celebrates everything that is great about Star Wars, it's a love letter to the fans and George Lucas who created this world in a galaxy far, far away.",1
5095,8.0,"The new Star Wars are far better than the first six. I was born in 95, I grew up watching Star Wars. But modern Star Wars beats the original in every single way. The characters, the story, the acting, the visuals of course. I'm shocked by most of these reviews.",0
5096,3.0,"Being no fan of pop-culture, I had never seen any of the films in the franchise until my early 50s when in May 2019, I added them to my streaming queue. Even though the special effects of the 42yo original seemed dated, I found it enjoyable with interesting characters and good writing. Within the month I had watched the first seven films, with Return of the Jedi being the best (in my opinion). I didn't even mind Jar-Jar Binks, but I should've stopped watching after the first seven. I was warned by a co-worker who is a mega-fan.",1
5097,8.0,"This movie was a joy ride.<br /><br />None of the previous Star Wars movies were ever universally rated exceptional.<br /><br />But this whole franchise, this whole world has been the best movie watching of my life.<br /><br />No other franchise ( Harry Potter is a close second) has given me ""all the feels"" in the theatre. Excitement, humour, romance and action.<br /><br />George Lucas always wanted this franchise to be like a Saturday morning serial. These movies were never meant to be ""Citizen Kane"".<br /><br />They have delivered on all counts.<br /><br />No other franchise can bring my whole family together like the Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />This movie did not disappoint. Reys father was a surprise but it's a good one. Well done",1
5098,6.0,"First of all, I have to say that the movie is pretty good. You get all the emotions and for me the c3po's memory wipe out, was one of the saddest moments, and the fight against the final order was the most exciting. Despite of that, the moive doesn't make much sense, why the force can heal now? Why Luke appears again? Why Rey call himself Skywalker? How she does to make of Kylo a good person? So many question that does not seem to have an answer.<br /><br />I love the fact of seeing a yellow saber and the skywalkers ones being buried, watching palpatine taking action again is also some sort of nostlagia to me, I hope they didn't call it The Final Order, it seems basic. To sum-up if you are a SW saga fan, like I am, you would probably enjoy it, if you don't and you have just seen the films not while ago, you would probably feel that the moive is a bit empty of content.",1
5099,1.0,JJ managed to make a movie worse than Phantom Manace. Impressive!,0
5100,10.0,The theater erupted at the end of this masterpiece. It felt like we were back in the good old days. I cannot imagine what happens next in the Star Wars universe but I know I am anxiously awaiting it. I am pumped just thinking about it.,1

5102,6.0,"The Rise of Skywalker follows on from The Last Jedi, a film which left many disappointed. When following on from a disappointed film, mending the mistakes is often what drags the film down. The final entry in the Skywalker saga feels like its own spin off story including the main characters. As said in the headline, there is way too many things happening within this film, therefore feels very rushed and crammed.",0
5103,8.0,"It the context of the entire Star Wars collection, having watched them all in order from episode 1 with my 8 year old the past couple weeks my first impression is that it is really enjoyable. It does feel rushed, and properly done this movie would have been 3-3.5 hours long.",0
5104,3.0,Rise of skywalker is plagued with stupid plots that make no sense or have any logic and stupid things and maybe the worst star wars movie ever also laws of phyzics do not apply in this movie and this one is not going to age well at all and i bet the next generation will watch episodes 4 and 5 and 6 and then this trash of movie is like WT<br /><br />2 things and 2 things only are good in this show:<br /><br />01 true power of emperor palpatine<br /><br />02 the 2 words said by ashley ekstein aka AHSOKA TANO,0
5105,5.0,"The movie looks beautiful and acting is fine. There are few positive sides however most of the action happening doesnt make any sense. Take the original trilogy, each episode brings you to 3-4 places where the characters have time to develop. Here within the first 5 minutes you have already visited 10 planets and you are just wondering why?Where?wait! But it's totally fine hey let's just introduce some few new characters! clearly the story is not very important as long as they went over their money making checklist.",0
5106,8.0,I'll make it real simple. Everyone of us knows how this movie ends. But go see it if you want to entertained for a few hours.,1
5107,10.0,Great character development and lovely new ones. Good effects and strong storyline. Builds on the relationship between Rey and Kylo.,1

5109,1.0,"You could hand the responsibility to a 6 year old with a crayon and they'd do more with the stories build up than these script writers did.<br /><br />Horrible. Disappointing, and uneventful to an astonishing degree",0
5110,6.0,Don't get me wrong this by far not the worst Star Wars movie nor is it the best it in between I been a Star Wars fan since the beginning but this movie did not fix the problem with the last one or and anything new it there to entertain you for two hours,0
5111,6.0,"Simply put, The movie is confusing. I don't mean hard to follow. I mean that it's hard to understand exactly how it all fits together and why the plot became what it did. If we look at the trilogy, 'The Force Awakens' was a great set-up for something wonderful, And 'The Last Jedi' was pure hollow nonsense which seemed to add nothing to the storyline, And 'The Rise of Skywalker' tried so hard to right the sinking ship. But, Because of the burden it had to bear, The entire movie felt like it was scrambling for footholds while falling off a cliff. It felt like trying to cram two movies into the space of one. It felt forced and rushed and left me so conflicted. I wanted to like it and tried to convince myself that it was the ending the trilogy needed, But to be honest it felt far too formulaic; Far too predictable because it was supposed to be an ending, But yet the characters felt completely disconnected from their previous movie's selves, Almost as if they never existed. The cinematography is fantasticly beautiful. The scoring is amazing. The choreography is the best in the trilogy. The action is fast paced and fun. To finalize, This movie was an average level of fun and does answer all the outstanding questions. But it leaves you with a bittersweet feeling. It does leave you wondering what could have been.",0
5112,1.0,I will say that the end is better than the beginning and middle. Is the movie worth getting that far? 🤷‍♀️ Meh.,1
5113,3.0,Star Wars be damned.,0
5114,8.0,"People giving a 1 star to this movie is just wrong. It doesn't deserve a 10, but a 1 is just sad. It's a good movie! Much better than episodes I, II, III, VII and VIII. Haters want to kill this movie!",0
5115,10.0,Enjoyed quite a bit. A few small things to disagree with but much better than TLJ.,1
5116,10.0,It wasn't perfect but the main storyline closed the loop for the saga well. They paid the new characters their due and saluted the ones from the original trilogy. I'm a massive Star Wars fan and I came out of the theater in my Jedi robes absolutely satisfied.,1
5117,5.0,"After analyzing the film there only one conclusion I have reach. They try so hard to please every fandom that they ended up hurting the entire community of Star Wars. This movie was the last of Skywalker , which I was okay with it, rather sooner than later they have to end. But not the way they have done it.",0
5118,9.0,"Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, but adopted the Skywalker name<br /><br />Kylo was redeemed and assumed his Ben Solo persona before dying to save Rey<br /><br />Finn expressed a slight force sensitive power and helped his friends<br /><br />Poe officially became the leader of the resistance alongside Finn<br /><br />Hux ended up being a spy for the resistance and was killed for it",0
5119,6.0,"Fight sequence is too blurry. Story is really average, quite a few holes in the plot. It depends too much on name.",0
5120,10.0,"I really liked it and I'm not a big sw fan, it was very entertaining and the story made sense for an unrealistic movie like this. Is not perfect but an enjoyable film that improves action from past movies and tries something new, the only big trouble I find annoying is the exaggerated amount of enemy ships at the end.",1
5121,9.0,People are saying how there is no plot or no dialogue but the thing is everything didn't come out of nothing one thing that is revealed has been built up to and the thing is it is the climax of the trilogy so think about it more of one continuous movie rather than one solo movie. Because I will admit the movie on its own wouldn't make much sense but with context from the whole saga makes sense,0
5122,10.0,"At last the one we wanted to see!<br /><br />Episode 7 = the remake of episode 4<br /><br />Episode 8 = the remake of episode 5<br /><br />Episode 9 delivers! The mystery behind Rae's past revealed. The return of some classic characters. To clutch at straws you can lock in some strong similarities between Jedi and RoS but in comparison to the two predecessors, this felt more independent which in turn made it less predictable and therefore a lot more enjoyable. Plenty of action and a saga finale to satisfy both newbies to the franchise and the loyal fans from e beginning.<br /><br />To summarise, well worth the cinema ticket and you shouldn't be disappointed come the ending credits.",1
5123,2.0,"Disney was obviously afraid of the toxic fans who raged about everything that was good about the previous two movies. The plot is cobbled-together and predictable, with no surprises, unlike every prior entry in the franchise. There is nothing new here, only an eye-roll-worthy, boring, uninspired, and downright ridiculous series of deus ex machinas strung together without any heart. They basically took all the most outlandish fan theories and made a movie out of them. Very disappointing end to the series.",0
5124,5.0,"I give 5 stars because of the very good actors and the outstanding visual effects.<br /><br />Otherwise there has been said enough by others, what this movie and the whole trilogy lacks.<br /><br />Very sad to see that an old experienced story manufactory like Disney didn't make it, because they were mainly (or only) looking for quick and secure profit.<br /><br />Shame on you Bob Iger and Kathleen Kennedy! You nearly ruined that fantastic galaxy. I would witch you with eternal damnation, if not Mando would appease and enjoy me that much!",0

5126,1.0,"There is no doubt that this movie was amazing. Great effects, costumes, actors and the plot was well done.<br /><br />However, the ending was a PURE MESS. I was so dissapointed when Ben Solo/ Kylo Ren died. Like why?? Adam Driver was the best actor! Kill the only skywalker left and call a movie the rise of skywalker. Just stupid.",0
5127,8.0,"There are alot of fanboys on the site condemning it, but I thought they did a great job solidifying the previous movies.",1
5128,6.0,Looks Disney at least realized how much true fans hated the last Jedi and corrected and salvaged what they can in this movie. Was it enough? Nope! Did it feel good? Damn yes!,0
5129,4.0,The characters sucm. Their behaviour towards each other is incomprehensible. They don't seem like real people and their motivations just flip ad the plot requires it. The dialogue is painful. The plot is bland and full of unbelievable conveniences. Drama is created just by misdirection and then resolved without explanation or even titillation.,0
5130,4.0,"The Skywalker Saga has finally come to a close and I have to say this movie isn't great, but isn't bad. I can't say I loved it but I would watch it again if given the opportunity. The Rise of Skywalker tried to end not just a trilogy but an entire saga, which doesn't always go so well, many people can agree Back to the Future Part III is the weakest one, or The Godfather Part III is the weakest film in that series, even Return of the Jedi (which was supposed to be the last movie) was the weakest in the original trilogy. What I an saying is it's not easy to end something, is that an excuse? No. But I wasn't expecting the best movie ever like everyone else. This film definitely appeals to fan theories and caters to what fans wanted after The Force Awakens, making this movie look like damage control for The Last Jedi, a movie at least half of the audience liked. I guess the CGI, acting, action and final scenes are pretty great, but I think Star Wars needs to take a break for now.",1

5137,4.0,"Actually I kind of liked The Last Jedi, but this movie just went for a whole different direction. Bringing back Palpatine was the most unnecessary twist they could have done. Not to mention that I was fine with Rey being a nobody, but in this movie, it turned out that he is Palpatine's grandchild. General Hux being a traitor all of a sudden is also a non-sense. Just because he hates Kylo Ren, he teams up with the Resistance? Seriously? And again Rey is so powerful after a minor Jedi training, that she is able to pull back a huge ship from the sky and defeats Palpatine single handedly. This trilogy is a huge mess, and for me there are only 7 SW movies. Including the Preguels, the OG Trilogy and Rogue One.",0

If you watch this film saying its terrible before going will make the film terrible for you . Because of that I went open minded to this film and I had fun and enjoyment . If I were you I would do the same and you will have fun . Some people didnt enjoy the movie and its totally fair . Not everyone likes the movie and I cant say anything to that . But some ""fans"" who were close minded and trying to look cool and get more likes are giving this movie a 1/2 star . They think that this will make them better Star Wars fans but in reality it makes you Star Wars Haters . You can say bad things about the film and they are correct but you cant give a movie 1/10 just its a new Star Wars movie this is raw hatred for the entirety of the franchise . Niw this movie has some cons as well but you cant give a movie 1/10 . I know I seem toxic about this because I am . The worst part is some people didnt even watch the movie and giving these scores . I am saying it again the movie has some cons . Yes . But it has many pros as well . The visuals and sounds are perfect and one of the (if not best) in the world . Lightsaber duals",0

As if these were not enough, writing a kissing scene between Rey and Ben... could possibly be the most idiotic idea for the new-trilogy. In the end, I'm going to erase all of my memories about the last three movies as best as I can. Come on Disney, I know that you have to put limitations like non-sexual scenes or not showing blood, savagery so much because you want to market the movie for bigger audiences.

The was so much excellent story covered in the film that I was surprised they were able to keep it as short as it is. The general vibe of the film felt very different from any other Star Wars film, but gave the same ""Oh heck, things are getting serious"" feelings as Revenge of The Sith.<br /><br />My only problem was that the opening scroll glossed over some significant events that would have been good to see in the film, but this was likely done to keep the runtime down and avoid too many unnecessary side plots.<br /><br />As a final statement, this is truly a movie for the fans, packed with enough fan service that anyone will be satisfied with Rise of Skywalker as a conclusion. The creative team behind this film likely realised that as the final movie in a 9 episode saga, who were the making the film for, if not for the fans?",1
5152,8.0,"Even though Episode VIII was not a very good movie, this one makes up for it. We finaly understand how the force works and where does Light and Dark side reside.

5153,,"Star Wars was something special when I was a kid. It was something unseen until then, something that challenged the little mind's limits and expanded imagination beyond the boundaries of my mind's own galaxy. But mostly, it succeeded because it was a story for kids and I was a kid. Fast forward 35 years. I saw it again and nothing trembled inside me. The little smile on my face was more out of pity than some rekindled feeling of the great adventures I took upon in my made up kid's world. Let's be honest: the movie is clumsy, story is the same plane old ""good vs evil"", the plot has more holes than swiss cheese, acting is at a soap opera level at best,costumes are ridiculously pathetic and unconvincing and the dialog, boy, the dialog is the absolute worse. Grown men cannot and should not find that amusing let alone get upset over it. For God's sake, it's people with buckets on their heads shooting out of plastic guns! Then one day, the guy who created all this (and who made billions by doing it) sold it for even more cash to some morons who have every right to do whatever they please with it. And half the world got upset? People, we all have bigger problems and much more important things to worry about than poorly written bedtime stories and Hollywood hacks who pretend to save the universe while wearing helmets resembling the front grills of known auto makes.

5156,8.0,I read a lot people rate this film down as there are horses in it and how could there be horses in space - I mean have they completely overlooked that all the main characters look a bit like erm human beings from earth - maybe the creatures look like horses but they ain't horses - a great film unfairly knocked by points like this.,1
5157,3.0,"This movie is not great, not terrible but forgettable and that is the real tragedy of the sequels. You will not remember them and not care about the characters. Would it just be a movie without backstory, it would be nice, but its Star Wars. Can anyone even remember the story?",0

5161,10.0,What a way to end Star Wars.<br /><br />Watched this with my 10 year old and both loved every minute of this movie.<br /><br />Fab scenes throughout and we actually felt the story helped make sense of linking all the previous films together,1

5163,4.0,"Worst of the three trilogies. Why rise of Skywalker, no Skywalker has risen still this ridiculous name. The only Skywalker that was left was absolutely trash in terms of being a Jedi. The girl is not a Skywalker. I thought perhaps Ben Solo's inner Skywalker would wake up but no a Palpatine told she is a Skywalker that too in the end. Hilarious name and ridiculous movie",0
5164,5.0,"As much as i wanted to love the rise of skywalker, it is simply shambolic. The entire film consists of backtracking/ overcompensating for the massive disappointment that was TLJ, and feels like the writers have just thrown Palpatine back in and blamed everything on him, without even really telling us how he's still alive? There are countless continuity issues that i could bring up but won't waste your time.",0
5165,7.0,I loved Carrie Fisher's character thru-out all the movies IV thru VIII but Ii found her digital insertion in IV distracting. I found myself pulled out of the story and looking for signs of computer special effects.,1
5166,10.0,"I was aware of the mixed reactions this film was getting, not none of the complaints I'd heard rang true AT ALL. The story flowed logically with good narrative drive. Everything that happened felt very organic -- nothing felt forced. The conclusion of the Rey/Kylo story line was handled deftly and with plenty of emotional punch. The acting was uniformly excellent. I loved it. I found it to be a really satisfying ending to the whole Star Wars saga.",1

5168,6.0,"When I first heard the laugh of the infamous Emperor Palpatine at the end of the trailer I couldn't wait for the final instalment of the 'Skywalker Saga'. The thought of seeing how this incredibly powerful and cunning sith lord had managed to not only survive the events of Return of the Jedi, but also yet again become a threat to the galaxy far far away was utterly tantalising.",1
5169,9.0,"I Really enjoyed this way more than I thought I would, even with all the spoilers I still really liked it, I was surprised. The movie felt very much like Star Wars, plus the jokes were not forced, and new characters like Babu Frik felt like they fit right into the Universe. Rey/Finn/Poe were back together, this was very refreshing, dialog was great, the interactions between all characters was very enjoyable and worked well. The best part for me was the corrections that erased the odd choices made for Luke and plot holes about Snoke and Rey. The new revelations also kinda made me like Ben Solo a little, we know better why he did what he did. Now about Rey, I was never a fan, I wanted Luke back in charge, but now I know this is not Lukes story, or Anakin, this is Rey's story which is made clearly obvious to my joy. This movie makes her character clear, Rey must confront her past and take a journey much like Luke did. We now know about her power and she is nothing like what we were left with after 8, she has issues much like Luke did, now both Luke and Rey are extremely important to the Star Wars mythos, neither more or less, but equal.",1
5170,10.0,My whole family really enjoyed this movie. Good ending to the saga. If last Jedi wasn't such a mess it would have been even better.,1
5171,6.0,"As a star wars fan I have lot's of mixed emotions about this movie . First off, I don't want to put any of the blame on JJ abrams I think he did a great job with what was given to him with the last Jedi . If he had done all three movies I am sure we would have had a coherent and fulfilling story, but Rian Johnson's TLJ ruined that( although , I think the last Jedi could have been a good standalone ) . Anyways, I always knew it would take a miracle or at least a 4 hr long movie to explain all the plot holes . Rise of Skywalker feels rushed and is still missing a lot of important story arc's , but in 2hrs what can you expect ! So blame the president of Lucas films for not getting a producer that can lead a coherent trilogy .",1
5172,3.0,Pros:<br /><br />Fantastic visuals<br /><br />Well directed and shot<br /><br />Great score<br /><br />Adam Driver is an amazing actor<br /><br />Some fun callbacks<br /><br />Some good action scenes,1
5173,6.0,"It is disapointing. I'm a long time fan of SW, but the lack os story and purpose is growing by each episode. It should be the oposite, as hundreds of good books, detailing and expanding the saga and its universe, the characters, the backgounds, were writen after the series creation. But what we see? A continuous loop, with the same elements, plot, drama and battles. Just repeating, reformating what was once new and briliant. And, as is now usual with Hollywood productions, they favor diversity over quality and objectivity.",0
5174,6.0,"Now I don't think it was absolutely terrible, but it didn't have the same charm as the original. I thought it would be a huge epic finale, but it ended up being a mish-mash of reveals that nobody saw coming.<br /><br />It tried too hard to appeal to the old star wars fans (bringing back Lando, Palpatine, The Death Star, The OG Star Destroyers, etc.)<br /><br />It definitely wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either.",0

5179,8.0,"Probably should of been two films done properly, then it wouldn't rush itself too much, and cut out some of the 'my little pony in space' antics too! If you look at the general pace and story of the Mandalorian for example, that is more like how Star Wars used to be, and this possibly could of too if it was two films.<br /><br />Or maybe not, who the hell knows ! They did however totally nail the very last scene, only a couple of minutes long, but wow.",0
5180,4.0,Not much of a story in this one. Everything that happens is very predictable. The story resurrects Palpatine do that they can have an ultimate bad guy. Ben goes back and forth between good and bad and Rey and Ben keep passing life force between each other. Palpatine had built and enormous amount of Star Destroyers but they cannot go up and get out of the atmosphere without the lead ship broadcasting a signal for them to go up. And all of these ships are located on a hidden planet just like in episode 2. Very lazy writing just regurgitating elements from earlier movies.,0
5181,6.0,"There are just too many plot holes and nonsensical things in the story to give this movie a higher rate although it tries to bring the saga to a nice end. Lots of questions pop up during the movie, however they remain unanswered. The characters have really great luck - things just happen to them by accident and eventually everything turns out well.",1
5182,,"This tale of hope, fidelity, righteousness and integrity never belonged to Disney and was and will not be at home with Disney.<br /><br />Disney needs to set Disney free by spinning it off and separating it from the corporate structure. Then we can be rid of hacks and morons like JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson and give Star Wars back to art and the force.",1
5183,10.0,"My second favourite movie in the franchise is this one and it makes me sad to see the amount of bad ratings. Trust me, this movie is great and there is a plot twist in it which I love don't listen to the people on social media.",1
5184,10.0,"Amazing! I was blown away from the start of the film. The action never lets up, the visuals are astounding, and John Williams writes his best music in this film. This is the Star Wars movie I've been waiting for since 2005.",1
5185,8.0,"I enjoyed this film. I didn't know what to expect, given the news that rviews were very mixed. But I think I went in expecting something far worse. So I was pleasantly surprised. There wasn't nearly as many new ""weirdo"" non-human characters introduced as some of the prequels. The movie worked very hard to stay focused on central characters we already know and have become used to - so that was great. The dark theme surrounding the Emperor haunted the plot, which was fantastic and - without adding a spolier here, this 40-something reviewer was super-pleased when an old favorite returned. I wasn't expecting it, but I really appreciated that character being brought back into the fold. A really nice Christmas gift for Star Wars fans. This movie maintains a steady pace, isn't overwhelmed with special effects and has been carefully crafted. Don't judge this book by negative press - go see it for yourself.",1
5186,6.0,There Could Have Been A Better Way To End Of The Franchise. It Was Like They Tried To Bring Something Back From The Last 8 movies. JUST NOT THAT GREAT,1
5187,9.0,"I think the people putting on negative reviews must think they are watching a Shakespeare film... Its Star Wars!! I have watched every film as it came out and I loved this. A fitting end to the series, it was great. Don't listen to these boring people who think it's a religion and want to find fault in everything. Finally my 14 year old son loved it as well.",1
5188,6.0,"OK, possibly even good but not really good.<br /><br />I feel like a teacher who wants to write a school report on a pupil saying ""Could do better"". I can see what they were aiming for. I think they missed. Star Wars was always about seductive evil vs good. The original trilogy did it far better. This seemed to jump around. It wasn't bad in parts and I can see why some would love it and some hate it. Overall OK but not really good. Not enough characterization for me.",0
5189,5.0,"I grew up with Star Wars, as my sister was a big fan since the first movie came out. In my young teens I could recite most of the dialogue of the OT and my sister, uncle and I would sometimes discuss what had happened to make Vader Vader etc. (This was pre-Internet.) I never read any of the novels, because they were not written by George Lucas (I know, silly).",0

5198,7.0,It's good considering Force Awakens and The Last Jedi but it is not better than prequels. Go watch and decide it yourself.,1
5199,8.0,"Was this the best movie ever? Absolutely not. Was it better than I expected? Definitely. For everyone saying that this movie ruined the story, what did you expect? The story was set up by the force awakens to be terrible. Rise of Skywalker saved this series. It gave depth to characters who had no emotion or development whatsoever. It tried to follow more of the force rules that the last two blatantly disregarded. The pacing, style, and tone FELT like the original Star Wars. This complex mess of a story was wrapped up quite nicely. Will I still be pretending that Return of the Jedi was the last movie? Yes. But bon't blame this movie for problems that began two movies ago. I was expecting this movie to be just as bad as the last two but was pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance.",1
5200,5.0,"How many times are we going to let the Star Wars writers get away with repeating the same plots, scenes, themes, and lines before we stop paying to see these movies? Why not just have the fans write them? Princess Leia's lines are so predictable that the writers have been able to complete 2 movies using archive footage of Carrie Fisher. I don't think most of us can honestly match all of C-3PO's quips with the episodes that he says them in. The Emperor's and Han Solo's scenes in this movie could have been pieced together with archive footage as well. Maybe they were.<br /><br />One story sequence was so poorly constructed that it took the writing to a new low for the franchise. This is when Chewbacca appears alive and well in the custody of the First Order after we have just seen the troop transport ship he entered blown up in a Force duel between Rey and Kylo Ren. Apparently there was a second transport ship that we were not aware of and Rey's Force powers had reached a level where she could inadvertently blow up a ship by aiming her hand at it and thinking but she still couldn't sense the presence or absence of one of her closest friends. Can the writers pull something like this and still expect us to believe any other story line in the movie? Apparently they can.<br /><br />I guess Disney has figured out that as long as they can piece together some nostalgic tripe into a semi coherent story, it will be enough for anyone 60 and under to go see hoping that this time it might be a good movie. Most of my friends consider seeing the latest Star Wars movie as a duty, to pay their respects to something that once was great. Now with Carrie Fisher's archive footage it is literally like paying respect at a wake.",0
5201,1.0,"Overall the best of the sequel trilogy, nice scenery and visuals, the music was amazing as always, the direction was ok, but...<br /><br />They had to bring back Darth Sidius to save it. And it was done super stupidly... And they didn't even called him with his true Sith name, they called him Palpatine.... And everything happened so fast. Endless plot holes that they didn't care to fill, (some other dude will fill them in a stand alone movie or new series right?) That is not the way to make a movie my friends... It lacks all the magic.<br /><br />I am sure there wasn't a fixed story from the beginning of the shootings from the very first episode of this trilogy. They improvised all the way to its ending. That is very obvious. Their goal must have been only copying the best scenes from the old movies to create nostalgia and stuff like that.<br /><br />This trilogy had no soul and core.<br /><br />For me the Star Wars saga ended with Episode VI.<br /><br />The trilogy sequel was just a bad dream.",0

5205,2.0,"I dont know where to begin. I was afraid of a multibillioncompany that only know happy endings and think only about the cash would turn Star Wars into casual wars.<br /><br />Biggest problems i noticed from the getgo of the series was the deletion of the old main characters and useless parts. Everybody who ever saw Star Wars was wishing for 1 thing and that 1 thing is for LUKE TO FIGHT HARD. He is our childhood hero and a jedi master now. Instead you let new generation jedi take all the action seriously!!<br /><br />JJ Abrams cannot be a star wars fanatic there is literally no way!! His plot bored me more than Sharknado 4.<br /><br />And then there is the auto moneymaker atm. multicultural. The movie needs all colours and genders to make sure everyone is interested and female empowerment to keep up with time. i cannot stress enough how much it makes me puke booredom casual.<br /><br />Third thing, its disney, they have never wrote anything without a happy ending. They are clueless to villainry. The movie is sooo sugarcoated. I see palpatine, but i dont sense evil nor do i sense power or any danger for anyone. Its pretty much as dangerous as lady and the tramp where they fight over meatballs and spaghetti.<br /><br />And whats with that kiss in the end, its just soo bad in every way.<br /><br />They tried the Leia vs Han way with Poe vs Rey, except this came out of context and was just (NO).<br /><br />And killing Luke in the 8th movie, who wrote that into the script, are you out of your mind!<br /><br />The amount of plotholes.... i wont even start.<br /><br />I dont know how they made mandalorian, but star wars to me, is 4th 5th and 6th and mandalorian, untill they make it disney and ruin that too obviously.",0

Go see it. Make your own mind up.. but we won't be seeing much of these characters again anytime soon, so you might as well enjoy it and love the ride. Well done JJ.. it was an impossible task but you did well.",1

5218,8.0,"Absolute bonkers movie. This is partly because JJA was clearly briefed to reverse a lot of TLJ and create a new plot. It's also because he wanted to make this movie a celebration of SW, and I liked that. Liked the menace of the knights of Ren but would have liked to see more of them. Of course it would have been better if the story had been written for this trilogy in advance but given that it wasn't I think the three films, although not well connected, are all great for different reasons. Really liked the role of Leia, helping Rey in her epic fight on the Death Star against Ray. Amazing. Love the scene of Leia and Luke training. Explains why Leia didn't become a Jedi.<br /><br />Overall I think the people making this thought, we can't please everyone so let's just have some fun with this.",1

5224,10.0,"This is easily the best film of the new trilogy and the second best Star Wars instalment from Disney, second only to Rouge One. In it's attempt to tie up all loose ends over a 40 year saga as well trying to right all the wrongs made in The Last Jedi, 2h 30m seems to be a very tight runtime... keeping up with the film means there's no room for toilet breaks & to get the most of it, multiple viewings a necessity. The film gives fans everything that's been missing from the last two films... Epic lightsaber fights, loads of action, well timed comedy relief & a space fight to end all space fights. It has it all. Ignore the critics, go and sit through 2h 30m of great cinema, you won't regret it.",1
5225,7.0,"First off, the original trilogy seems impervious to dethronement. Thats okay I guess. Each trilogy represents a dynasty in the story each with their pros and cons. Personally I-III are my least favorite but serve a purpose in the cannon nonetheless. Episode IX had ALOT riding on it. There were a bajillion loose ends to tie up and I doubt all the money, producing & directing gumption could have satisfied the masses with majority resolve.",0
5226,5.0,"Except that Poe is really an afterthought trilogy with a low face value. From the beginning to the end I could see a black question mark. Although Star Wars has always been buggy enough to insult the IQ of the audience, this one is so stupid to bring the PPT back! Basically, it overturned the settings of the previous six, and An Zuotian killed the PPT as the son of the natural selection to bring balance to the Force. As a result, Dasmic said that PPT is still alive as a demon. EXCUSE ME? ! What is the struggle and sacrifice of the first six films, a big joke. The Forces couple is a good CP in the same fan culture, but it 's true, but what the hell is this relationship line in the movie? Could it be that the two of them used ForceTime to start online dating? Rey's clothes and the final pose of the lightsaber were probably X-Men in the previous life. There is no spark in the new trio. There was no disturbance in the whole process, only Chewie heard tears when she heard the news that the princess was dead. Forget it, I'm still waiting to watch the galaxy master's foreign flyer man drama. And, the double sunset of Tatooine and the original sound of Williams are immortal! ! !",0
5227,7.0,"So as a fan of the Force Awakens and the Last Jedi, it's overall a good movie. I like what they did with Kylo Ren and the new force powers Rey uses fits well in the Star Wars universe. I know a lot of people were disappointed with the Last Jedi but the only thing I didn't like about it was they got rid of Kylo's helmet which is back in this movie and really looks awesome.<br /><br />I think the mediocre reception of this movie is probably because it's the end of this trilogy but it really ends the story of Kylo and Rey well imo. Also, the scene with the Knights of Ren and Kylo towards the end of movie is one of my favorite in the entire trilogy.",1

5231,8.0,"Reminded me a lot of return of the Jedi. Having read negative reviews I can see it both ways, on the one hand the movie is problematic in that it borrows and resurrects too much from the past. It feels frankly ridiculous to still be watching the same old rebels vs empire in the same ways as before.",1
5232,10.0,"Never mind the naysayers- this movie does not disappoint. Non stop action, a moving story, hardly knew how long I was in the theatre. It's worth watching and it's hardly a 7.0 (rating at the time of my review).",1
5233,8.0,"That would be the perfect headline for me for Episode 9. A SGI astonishing spectacle with poor, overrun and overrushed chaotic plot and messed up storyline. The final trilogy is not that bad, it's just a total mess of ideas but lucks a general idea and agenda. New and old characters come and go as quickly as you can't even imagine and you at some point are like: ""What the... is going on here?"". The cast, except Ray and the old actors, is just hilarious and pitty. Some look like a complete morons. The directors themselves are different that shows the mere inconsistency. Where many people deal with something, results are tragic. Hollywood commercial people who don't love or even understand the spirit of the Star Wars universe.",0
5234,8.0,Nice again...expected worse... it's still Star Wars!<br /><br />Go and see it... then judge,0
5235,8.0,This was a fun movie to watch and my kids loved it. This had something for everyone. Don't listen to the haters.,1
5236,8.0,The movie fixed a lot of things that were bad in the Last Jedi and made you not even think it existed in the first place. Yes the movie had its weird rushed moments but the half of the movie really sucked me in and took me on a ride. 8/10,0
5237,6.0,"You might aswell just get it.<br /><br />It feels like they kind of painted themselves into a corner in the 2 last movies. This movie felt like they just said ""You know what? Lets give the fans exactly what they wanted!"" And the fans dont know that what they want doesnt make a good movie.",0
5238,5.0,"In fairness, my expectations were cautiously lowered coming in, which was perhaps the right preparation for the 155-minute run time. This is by no means a bad movie, like its predecessor. It's not a particularly grand finale to 40+ years-old saga, but at least it's not riddled with plot holes and dumb irrational characters like its predecessor.",0
5239,10.0,"I really enjoyed this movie... This is not a review, this is just me sharing my impressions.<br /><br />It was a great ride in this fantasy universe that was born from minds of thousands of people involved in its expansion over the decades. What a thrill, what a joy. That same joy I had watching every single one of those films.",1
5240,1.0,"But I watched till the end, cause my wife wnted to see reilo kissing.<br /><br />She does not hate the movie, whe thinks it is just bad.",0
5241,9.0,"The movie went by so fast. If you are a fan of Star Wars you will love this movie - don't get distracted by the boring negativity around it. It's well paced, looks amazing, has surprises (if you avoid the spoilers), has some some new characters that don't distract from the established storyline, heart warming scenes and manages to wrap up most of the story threads. Sit back and enjoy the end of this Star Wars journey and shrug at those that can't appreciate it.",1
5242,4.0,The introduction of Palpatine into this episode and its cohesiveness with the storyline were so weak it could well pass as a sketch for The Saturday Night Live.,0

5248,6.0,Although a Star Wars fan disappointed in the storyline and telling. Up to the next trilogy,0
5249,7.0,Don't believe all the bad reviews. Not the best star wars movie but definitely worth seeing. There is no way possible that all these new Star Wars movies could top the first three made. People are going in to these movies with very high expectations that's why you're seeing bad reviews.,1
5250,1.0,"I actually really liked this movie right up until the last few minutes. Abrams, the liberal director, put in a gay scene! Disney is just as culpable for allowing such trash to be inserted into, an otherwise good film. Walt Disney must be rolling over in his grave. I will not be buying the 4K UHD disk, specifically for the aforementioned reason... & I'm sure I'm not the only one!",0
5251,8.0,"Look, I didn't *hate* TLJ, but it was definitely a bit of a mess, and ruined a lot of the story progression in ways that I wasn't sure the trilogy could recover from. To my surprise, Rise of Skywalker managed to fix it but it suffered heavy losses in the process; the film feels a little bit all over the place, with scenes being cut short and the plot progressing at a ridiculously fast pace throughout. There are important chunks missing largely due to the loss of Carrie Fisher whose scenes were mostly unrelated snippets worked into the story (and very well done I must say, there just weren't enough of them). If this film had been two films, I think the issues with pace would have been fixed.",1
5252,9.0,"If you like Star Wars, you like this movie. By far the best of the new trilogy. Better script, way better saber fights, just overall a pretty good movie.",0
5253,1.0,"I came only from the cinema from the night session, the film is very good Star Wars magic is there and the chemistry between the characters is simple cool there are still a lot of very good moments that will give you goosebumps and peace if you are a real fan of star wars then the film will come to you and by the way I am a real fan of stars and me I liked the film, I don't understand people who are supposedly fans, but they didn't like the film, then if the fans don't give you goose bumps even if the very magical moments do not give you goose bumps, you can just forget about them for critics today. and this is a begushim Blade who understood",1
5254,8.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is the ultimate byproduct of two competing visions. In episode 8, Rian Johnson obliterated much of what JJ Abrams had built up in episode 7. And now in episode 9, JJ Abrams had to retcon much of what Rian destroyed in episode 8.",1
5255,1.0,"This is not only the worst star wars ever made, It's probably the worst movie ever made. This film discover new depth of mediocrity. The only positive point about this scam, is that the destroying of the star wars saga and spirit is definitely over, at least we hope so...",0
5256,6.0,"Well, I'm one of the die hard fans of Star Wars, one of the guys who consumed almost all the good old Expanded Universe and video games. When Force Awakens was first released I was lucky to watch it a day earlier and I was amazed how J.J Abrams handled the movie, introducing us interesting characters and a new Star Wars world which we are familiar but strangers at the same time. The cinematography of Force Awakens was one of the best movies, each frame deeply influenced me. I like the idea of a female protagonist, Rey, being a mysterious character, leaving us with tons of theories about who she is. Finn, a First Order deserter showing us that a simple soldier in an evil faction can actually have humanity in themselves. Poe, a dynamic character setting the pace in a relatively well seated movie. Kylo Ren, a struggling character haunted by the voices of the past. And of course our beloved characters from the original trilogy. Everything seemed fine. Up until the Last Jedi. I don't want to blame Rian Johnson for the storyline, but apart from it, the Last Jedi lost the cinematographic quality and slower pace of the Force Awakens. Luke Skywalker, being in an isolation seemed too strange, but everybody changes. Why not Luke Skywalker? And it seemed a little justified in the final movie of the saga.",1
5257,2.0,This movie has so many plot holes I cant even count them. Almost nothing makes sense and it seems as if they director had no plan whatsoever.,0
5258,1.0,At points in this movie I was torn between utter amazement and bitter disappointment. JJ Abrams managed to piece the franchise back together but truth be told it was tarnished by the end if episode 7. The origin of Rey was a shock (welcomed) but the FINAL ORDER and the first scenes were chilling to the core. But forced lines and hammy performances can't be glossed over. Daisy Ridley was pretty awful and a stronger script would have helped her. An awkward goodbye and CGI for Carrie Fisher made me sad but then lack of Rose Tico made me happy (or should I say they didn't make her character lame this time). Plenty of laughs and some EPIC scenes made this an emotionally satisfying farewell but I can't help but feel it could have been so much more had the trilogy not been ruined by Rhian Johnson and politically correct agendas.,0
5259,5.0,"The only reason I'm giving this hot pile of garbage any stars, is because of the cinematography and special fx. Although, it seemed at times the overuse of special fx was used to distract the viewer from an actual story being told.",0
5260,7.0,"I know this is Rey and Kylos story, but there was no love shown towards anakin. Anakin was The Chosen one to destroy the sith which he did in episode 6 as we thought but obviously didn't. We only see force ghost Luke and Leigh. I really thought we would get a force ghost of Anakin and yoda too but sadly not. In my eyes the whole Star Wars series is based on anakin so to just have him whisper one line in this movie is some disrespect. Also we never find out how Palpitine had a kid and to have Rey as his granddaughter. We don't know anything about the knights of Ren, and this movie is just fast going from one place to another as if it's like 2 movies into one. I also really wish they had a huge Foce ghost party showing everyone from the past but no. They win the war and all just hug each other. As a Star Wars fan I was a little disappointed and give it a 5/10. But putting my fanboy aside it's a 7/10 that gives us the answers we wanted, but is still really fast paced and makes you question some decisions made.",1
5261,6.0,The plot was awful.<br /><br />Action and camera is nice.<br /><br />In general Ja Ja Abrams ruined a star wars universe and you just not believe in the story and sometimes even laughing on it.<br /><br />Guys watch better it later in home.,0
5262,2.0,The whole movie tries to explain the unanswered questions from The force awakens and The last Jedi. It inflicts additional damage to the legacy of the first six Star Wars movies. It undermines the previous two episodes in the name of giving original-trilogy Star Wars fans a reassuring pat on the Head. It is so concerned with character reveals that it finds no time for real character work! In addition it's an 142 minute of gender mainstreaming propaganda!,0
5263,8.0,"I am a fairly new Star Wars lover. I was first introduced to the galaxy far far away in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which continues to be my favourite Star Wars film. Next, 2017's The Last Jedi came out and to be honest, I was thoroughly dissapointed with the end result. Now we have the final episode of the Skwalker saga: The Rise of Skywalker. Let me just say, it is a lot. A lot of it is ironically JJ Abrams trying to fix what Ryan Johnson did with Last Jedi. This is the ending that was concieved, but I dont think its the full thing that was concieved by JJ.",0
5264,4.0,"Everything in this trilogy felt so contrived. It sacrifices writing and plot to appeal to all audiences. Eg. Old actors were used for old fans of Star Wars, all races and sexual orientations were included, heavy-handed feministic writing, and so on. These filming methods are not inherently bad on their own. However, attempting to create content to satisfy every ideology will always come at the expense of the argument/story. That is, no single piece of work can ever be truly redeemable if it is unwilling to risk creating a divided discourse among its consumers.",0
5265,1.0,"I wanted this movie to be good, at lest memorable.. I only truly cared about 4 things that came this year, endgame, joker, game of throne and this.. truly wanted this movie to be good.. to be perfect.. because it was ending the biggest movie saga of all time, the emotions and memories attached to this saga was extremely high. There was no way that this movie was gonna please all the nerd fandom from fans and critics but if marvel can pull off, star wars can also... that was the assumption. But what happened... the movie is utter garbage... which ruined my childhood.<br /><br />it's not just fanboy ranting, there are good things about this movie as well as things i did not wanted to see like ever..<br /><br />lets start with the good things:<br /><br />1. John williams score-- which was just awesome, it gave me shivers and filled me with nostalgia..<br /><br />2. Babu frik: i dont think i have to say anything more than his name... he is awesome.. just excellent...<br /><br />3. acting: the acting was spot on especially adam driver's<br /><br />4. Nostalgia : Watching my favorite characters again gave me chills, weather it;s harrison ford or mark hamil or carrie fischer or lando or even the emperor himself. it was just awesome",1
5266,8.0,Now I had low expectations going into this I expected it to be awful because of the rt score and reviews from some of my fave youtubers. Turns out the movie wasn't as bad as i was expecting in all honesty it's a 7.5/10 it's got good character development is full of fan service and even has a decent plot. My problems with the movie are the pacing and dialogue Rey and Finn feel stale cuz of the lines they are given. Also the fight between 2 people in act 3 was kinda me with how quick it was. All in all JJ abrams did a good job finishing this trilogy it was average and doesn't deserve the hate it is getting.,0
5267,10.0,"I'm a true Star Wars fan and always enjoy going back for the originals and to see what Disney has in store. The remains of the Death Star was amazing along with the original voice actors for all of the olds jedi. I was surprised they got Harrison Ford back for the movie. Yes, Palpatine appeared out of nowhere, but he was teased at the end of The Last Jedi. The Star Wars franchise always fascinates me on what it could cook up in every movie. This one blew me away. I saw it with the rest of my family and we loved it, except for my sister.",1
5268,7.0,"Maybe my expectation were too high, but honestly I was bored 2/3rds of the movie. Too much fan service as well, which felt hollow. There were some epic scenes though, stand off or fight scenes between Keylo and Rey I think both their performances were very good. To see those scenes, the movie is worth watching. The ending, I thought, lacked any creativity. Anyway normally I would go twice to a star wars movie, but this time I won't, I think that pretty much sums up my feelings. I am Sorry.",0
5269,7.0,"Let me be clear. I hated The Last Jedi. It took all the threads from The Force Awakens and snuffed them. Luke was turned into crazy uncle hobo , characters for the most part were unlikable and I couldn't root for them...and the plot was a jumbled mess.<br /><br />Shame on Rian Johnson for taking that direction... TLJ turned Star Wars into a charred corpse.<br /><br />So here we are. In TROS its a year later. I wont spoil it for you, but the characters are likeable, it feels like SW. Lots of action and I beleived in the story. No, its not perfect but... JJ wasnt left with much. Lots of fan service... and thats just fine with me!",0
5270,8.0,"Some people just have to hate anything other than the original trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker isn't The Empire Strikes Back(which is the best in my opinion) but it's pretty damn good. Just ignore reviews and make up your own mind.",1
5271,,"The last movie was a decent end to the new trilogy, of course it was never going to come close to the original, but what can? It had its issues here and there, but all in all I enjoyed it, best of the new trilogy, I'd say. Will certainly watch it again at some point, but it's not going in my top 10 list any time soon.",1
5272,3.0,"I just watched it for the 2nd time because I was just that bored. It was like watching it for the first time. It was like I had never seen it. That being said, it was so bland that I'm pretty sure I'll forget it again. Here's to hoping.",0
5273,8.0,I was very exited to see star wars the rise of skywalker. i went to the midnight screening with a audience of 500 which was amazing. now right from the first minute of the film it was action packed. the movie felt completely rushed and i feel liked they needed to release this film before 2020. so many scenes have a huge back story and they felt the need to put it into a 5 min sequence.,1
5274,10.0,"Negative reviews? Why?!? The story has evolved in something much greater for you ""film critics"" to comprehend. The cinematography in this movie is one of the best I've seen so far. The special effects are simply breath-taking!",1

5276,5.0,As a fan of Star Wars I feel like I have been spit in the face. All characters feel like they were rewritten in a poor way. Nothing seems to make sense. And the final act is the most cringy fight in all of Star Wars,0
5277,6.0,Ignore the haters i really like this movie but there is a big reason it is hated. In the final battle against the final order when you think the resistance aren't going to win and no one is coming and then loads of ships in the sky you should be really happy and excited but because the movie is so rushed you dont feel emotional.,1

I can admit some have not been great but this one has heaps to love, resonating themes of mateship and sacrifice, light speed action and adventure. A story that holds together and brings you to an epic finale! There are 1 star ratings on imdb , the John Williams score is a solid 8 even if you disliked the film. These low ratings are questionable and would take little notice to them, go and see this film for yourself. Its time true fans stood together and forgot about the noisy disgruntled minority of wingers. The force is strong with this one !!",1
5284,8.0,"As a big star wars fan that was a kid when Episode 1, 2 and 3 came out. I remember cringing at some of the acting and directing in those movies. although I enjoyed them because I wanted to enjoy them. This movie was easy to enjoy - the action was fine, the special effects were fine, everything I would expect from a Star Wars film was in here, there were twists and turns, lots of science type things that aren't explained, but of source it's Star Wars, it's not sci-fi, so it tends not to make sense. I really enjoyed it overall. It felt emotionally satisfying to me, I like the characters - Poe Dameron was less annoying on this one than the previous two. Finn seemed more mature, although less involved. Rey was great, and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was great. They don't waste time - bringing in the first twist of the story during the opening crawl. This continues right through - with lots of additional info that adds a bit to the Star Wars canon. I think it complemented The Last Jedi and the Force Awakens quite well.",1
5285,10.0,"Aa a long term star wars fan I really enjoyed this film, go see it! It wrapped everything up well and added to the saga, considering how much work was left to do in 2.5 hours after the mess left by episods 8 this film did what I could and did it well!",0

It did not feel like a fitting end to a finale 9 movies in the making and the end fight was dreadful, the last third was so corny and comical... I did so many eye rolls.

5292,8.0,"On one hand, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a VERY fast-paced film. The audience is thrown straight into the action and throughout the entire film there are very little breaks between the action. This made the plot very hard to follow at times, as there is a lot going on all at the same time.",0
5293,10.0,I went to a midnight filming of this film and I loved it. There were great scenes between Rey and Kylo Ren. I loved their sabre fight and how things were resolved between them and between Ben Solo and his Dad. Fantastic action and great special effects. I will be buying the Blu-ray the day it comes out.,1
5294,6.0,"I have waited a few days to give a review and have now seen the movie twice.<br /><br />This trilogy has suffered greatly by it being made up as it went along. With no one vision each movie in the trilogy has lurched into an opposite direction to the last.<br /><br />The prequel trilogy was not the best but it did at least add whilst taking nothing away from the original trilogy.<br /><br />I felt all the way through this journey Rey has had it too easy in her development of the force. Making her Palpatine's grandchild does not satisfy this for me.<br /><br />The rise, fall and redemption of Anakin has been wasted on a shallow, made up as it went along film.<br /><br />To me I could buy it if it was Ben with Anakin and Luke as force ghosts who eventually destroyed the emperor.<br /><br />One thing I must praise is Adam Driver's acting. You could see in his face when he became Ben again. The child like vulnerability showing in his face was a diamond highlight in this movie.",0
5295,10.0,"Unlike so many picky people, I found this last episode to be more than satisfactory. I loved all of it and only was disappointed in a tiny bit at the ending.

For true Star Wars fans, this is a wonderful finish.",1

If we all agree that TESB is the perfection of the saga, find a friend and let him watch return of the jedi, it's embarrassing. A new death star same plot and the death of Palpatine, the true villain, threw down like a he was a puppet, and the ewoks killing soldiers like it was a snowball's fight, but you don't complain about that because is ""sacred"".<br /><br />If social medias were a thing back in the 80's you would have been here still complaining about what you didn't like.",1

It was as if J.J. wanted to disregard everything that happened in The Last Jedi and do his own version of the movie within this movie, leading to the most convoluted plot with strange pacing.

There were a few good moments but they were so few and far between that I left the theater laughing, feeling confused and frustrated.",0
5304,5.0,"Simply put, enjoy this film as a stand alone, or a piece of legends material. In the wider context it doesn't comfortably fit with the rest of the cannon universe (possibly breaking some of it at times), but taken alone it is an enjoyable escapade in the star wars universe.",1

5306,2.0,Forget that it's a Star Wars movie and has a legacy to live up. Judge this movie on its own merits and it really is just a bad movie. The characters are bland at best and the stakes are non-existent. Disney never built any sense of a galaxy to be threatened.,0
5307,7.0,Disney plays it really safe with the latest entry into the Star Wars universe. It manages to find a way to include homage and fan service for fans of the original and prequel trilogy. Some might find themselves disappointed in it's inability to provide much more but if you just go into this with open mind and ready to just have a fun time with likeable characters than there are rays of light to be found in the final entry of the Skywalker Saga.,1
5308,4.0,"This is what happens when there is no plan and each director has free range and no common arc. From the writing to the acting this was hard to watch. I wasn't a fan of The Last Jedi until I saw this movie. As with all the movies in this trilogy the timeline was terrible, it seemed like everything happened in hours. I can't express how disappointed I am with this. Shame on Disney.",0
5309,7.0,"I saw The Rise of Skywalker December 19th at one of the late night showings. I purposefully did not read any prior leaks or reviews of the movie as I did not want to be biased to spoiled before going in. I did not read any theories and tried not to make any of my own. My friend whose Star Wars knowledge can be summed up in a question he asked me during the film ""Is that Luke Skywalker?"" when Han Solo appeared. Me, being an avid fan of the series who grew up with the Prequels, Battlefront 1 and 2, LEGO Star Wars, and Rogue Squadron, along with reading countless canon and legend books/comics before Disney purchased Lucasfilm, I came in wanting the best for the Original Trilogy and the storyline of Anakin, Luke, and Leía Skywalker. I can genuinely and whole-hearted say J.J. Abrams did the absolute best he, or anyone else for that matter, could in concluding the Skywalker saga and the three trilogies. I loved the film, plain and simple. Was it perfect? Of course not, no film is, even Empire Strikes Back (my favorite movie of all time). But what I can say is that I enjoyed so much more of this film than I disliked, only having a few minor critiques that don't involve the story at all, just better portraying scenes and events better. I've read the critics and other reviewers negative feelings of the film and I honestly am sorry for them. I'm not mad or frustrated, simply disappointed they cannot stop complaining and enjoy something that deserves to be celebrated. I encourage everyone to not let others opinions of the film to diminish their own feelings of the film before and after seeing it for themselves. Critics, predictions, expectations, and theories, in my opinion, are the true tragedy of the Sequels not the films themselves. The Rise of Skywalker will be one of my favorite all-time films, maybe even surpassing Empire Strikes Back after more time. In summary, I loved The Rise of Skywalker and encourage everyone to let go of their preconceived biases before and after seeing it for themselves.",1
5310,8.0,"To give this movie a 1 Star is a joke. The movie is brilliant and entertaining , I think people need to realise that you Can't always stick in the past. They needed to bring some new ideas to the table every time they made a new movie and boy they did . To give this a 1 is just stupid it's more then a 1 Star it's truly gripping and exciting.",1

5312,10.0,"I saw this movie at the Cinema and thought it was fantastic. I cannot understand some of the negative reviews and think sometimes people just wanted it to fail. The latest trilogy is the best by far of the franchise and The Rise of Skywalker was a fitting finale, great job JJ and Rian.<br /><br />By the way the movie is just starting to be shown on the small screen and Radio Times reviewer Alan Jones gave it 5 stars (maximum)🙂",1
5313,2.0,"You can make strong awesome female o lgbt characters like Gina Carano in The Mandalorian. This movie just force it with no build up or character devolepment. It is obvious the creators are just ticking boxes to appeal to the new movements and new demographics. Furthermore, it totally disregards preestablished rules in the previous trilogies. Finally, apparently Rey is overpowered when it fits the narrarive jumping around like Yoda in II; and sometimes she can't even jump over a rock.",0
5314,8.0,"People talk about how dissapointing the sequels are, but most people have put the originals on a pedistal, and forgotten how most of the prequels are terrible. The sequels are way better in special effects quality, and they had me way more invested in what was going to happen. I think that a good way to see Star wars is, instead og seeing them as a big saga, see them as three different triolygies and you will be blessed that we got 9 amazing movies.",1

5320,9.0,"On the very day I turned nine years old, May 25, 1977, a film was unleashed on a very unsuspecting public when STAR WARS it our screens.<br /><br />Nothing like it had ever been seen before, and children today simply don't understand how big of a deal this film was! Almost every film released today are huge, bloated spectacles, overstuffed with CGI effects and loud explosions, but when ""Star Wars"" was released, it was most definitely a one-of-a-kind.<br /><br />It not only changed the face of the industry, it changed how films were made.<br /><br />I grew up with the Star Wars Saga as a part of who I was. I associate many happy childhood memories to that Galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />Like with most fans, I wasn't particularly impressed with the prequel trilogy, but when ""The Force Awakens"" came out in December 2015, I was very impressed. This film was accused by many as just a rehash of 'An New Hope' (when I was a kid, there was none of this 'Episode 4, A New Hope'. It was simply STAR WARS!) but I thought it was fantastic.<br /><br />'The Last Jedi' wasn't everybody's cup of tea, but I enjoyed the film.<br /><br />""The Rise of Skywalker"" is now upon us, and it's the final chapter in the Star Wars Saga, and I must say that I was very,, very impressed with the way things have tied up.<br /><br />During the screening, I was laughing, and enjoying the thrill ride that was the classic Millennium Falcon.<br /><br />There were many nods to the original trilogy which were delightful, and our heroes Poe, Rey and Finn all work very well together.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention any plot points or spoilers, but what I will say is that this well worth the wait from this old fan of the series!<br /><br />What was very clever was the story arc concerning Leia, considering Carrie Fishers untimely death in 2016.<br /><br />All our old heroes are back for the final curtain call, but this film was tinged with sadness because of the loss of Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker.<br /><br />The Force was DEFINITELY with ""The Rise of Skywalker"" in my opinion.<br /><br />I was nine when the saga began, and now, at the age of 51, I got to see the story come to an end.<br /><br />May the Force be with you!!!",1

This movie has many plot holes like how Emperor survived and if he survived then how can be Anakin is the Chosen one. How the force was balanced if he didn't die at all this makes no sense.",0
5325,8.0,"Look, the older generation will never recapture the magic that was the original star wars trilogy. But the rest of us have been spoilt from choice with fantasy films. Which this is. Yes there's plot holes, and yes some story lines could of been used in more depth. But hey, this is a movie set in a galaxy. A long long time ago. So if it's light sabre duels, space ships getting blew up with lasers and general fun with kick ass graphics btw. Go and enjoy. A 1 out of 10. Really. Grow up people. A hallmark Xmas movie with no budget gets that. This was a feast for the eyes. Nothing more nothing less. In imax 3D. Hold on for the ride.",0

5327,4.0,"A true devolution from the original Star Wars saga. The plot stumbled through the 2 hours with disregard for any decent story telling. Nothing was really explained,it rushed from scene to scene. It seemed like the writers decided to re write the rules on what the Force is and what we know from previous films to simply try to awe watchers with fancy graphics. Very disappointing.",0
5328,6.0,"As a movie, this film is decent, but as a Star Wars movie, its okay. Visual effects are amazing, acting is decent, story is okay but filled with loopholes and loose ends tied up lazily. I still think this is a decent movie though, it just could have been better as its the end of a saga that so many people know and love.",0
5329,10.0,Fun action packed end to the saga I've grown up with. Me and my family thoroughly enjoyed it and it seems some people need to go watch it the movie and not make their minds up over others reviews. do yourself a favour. See the film! Absolutely fantastic,1
5330,7.0,It was a meh type of film. JJ Abrams really tried to stop the bleeding from the previous film. I can tell there was a quite of few edits to make it a enjoyable film. Too many unanswered questions but it does give new hope for new fans. As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I'm just glad for The Mandalorian.,1
5331,5.0,I have my flaws with the movie little gripes here and there but nothing that makes me hate the film. My biggest problem is the same sex kiss at the end. There is no need to pander to the LGBTQ community this is Star wars not a political add,0
5332,10.0,It's hard not to love this movie if your a Star Wars fan as a kid in from the 70's. Delivers everything that was needed in the final chapter. I honestly can't understand the negative vibe. Perfect in every way.,1

5336,9.0,"After the disgrace of episode 8, the rise of Skywalker has a million loose ends to tie, and needs to find logic in a story arc that doesn't not exist. JJ Abrahams did the best he could with what he had. Star Wars doesn't have to go a different way. Episode 8 was just unnecessary and the reason why episode 9 had to clean up everything in a rush. So this is the best Disney SW movie after Rogue One.",1

5339,5.0,"I'd go to a Star Wars movie at the cinema even if its rating was 1/10 and my mind was all set up before it. I just have to see it as long as it's part of the Star Wars universe.

5340,10.0,"Very epic ending and great movie to watch and is definitely worth the time going, do not listen to the critics if you are a true star wars fan this is for YOU",1
5341,7.0,"First of all my rating for the whole trilogy is 5/10 and this is very important for reviewing episode 9..It is true that the trilogy had two major faults.. Assigning it to two different directors-writers and the lack of finding imagination-inspiration in terms of narrative and character creation-development<br /><br />We shall never forget that the rise of skywalker had to fix a handfull of errors of the last jedi in order to restore some fundamental principles of the star wars universe such as good-evil relationship, luck of some characters' origins and identity..Of course the fact that Ray is related to Palpatine is convenient, of course Kaylo converting to the light side is convenient, of course Palpatine rising to power is convenient but we must not compare these with the first trilogy when everything was blank canvas for the audience. If i had the chance i would go back in time and write a different story for this trilogy but with the facts given from the previous movies this was the best outcome possible...<br /><br />Aside from all of these, the movie had one of the best scenes in history of star wars with Ray &Ben force fighting over the control of a battle ship. Air combats were pretty much the same as always with Bo copying Han Solo (which i didn't like)..<br /><br />This is not a convenient comic reliefed movie, it is just the best remedy for the past mistakes, which made the machine working but deep down we know that it is broken and needs replacement.<br /><br />Lastly, i believe that overall, making a new trilogy with characters from the past like Luke, Leia, Solo, Palpatine, Lado with so many connections to the successful first trilogies is the riskiest thing to do because if you don't do it right you will make the audience angry.",1
5342,8.0,"I seriously think that all of the hate for this movie comes from Star Wars fans who hate everything except the original trilogy. Get over yourselves! Nothing will ever live up to the original trilogy, it was ground breaking, and you'll never feel like you did the first time you saw the original Star Wars.",0
5343,6.0,This film is decent enough. I see a lot of people find this film to be a disservice to star wars fans and i partly agree with them. It didn't capture the craftsmanship and the brilliant storytelling of the original trilogy. JJ Abrams didn't know what direction to take with this film. It felt disoriented and muddled at times. It is a decent film but not the best star wars film. I did find the ending quite satisfying personally. But this film was definitely a let down. 6/10.,1
5344,6.0,The final episode of Star Wars saga was quite disappointing to the Star Wars followers.,0

Happy and funny and something the whole family can watch! We loved it. We love all of them because of this same reason. It's not that serious people. It is MAKE BELIEVE and for the 2 hours you're in it, it feels like you're in it. That's the whole idea!",1

5349,3.0,"It's a cool movie, but utterly unoriginal. A ton of ridiculous and unnecessary nostalgia plugs in the middle of a souped-up version of RotJ. Fun, but nothing we haven't seen a million times before. Definitely the weakest of the new trilogy.",0
5350,,I don't wanna give a rating. But lol how does this have a 6.5 rating. 😂 It deserves a 4 at most in my opinion. Just quite depressing as a Star Wars fan that this movie exists.,1

I must admit I was prepared to hate on this movie, I disliked a lot of stuff about The Last Jedi but like the title of my review says, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a big Star Wars fan, I love the original trilogy and I like a lot of things about the prequels also. This movie is a lot of fun, I enjoyed every minute of it and I believe any fan of Star Wars will enjoy the final chapter in the Skywalker saga.

5362,7.0,It's a very entertaining movie but the plot is very straightforward and predictable. It tries too hard not to disappoint fans. It's a great movie but not nearly as memorable as the original trilogy.,1
5363,1.0,Another pile of garbage. Full of lens flares. On the off chance JJ reads this. I really wish it was possible to choke you with lens flares. I mean just shove them down your throat like you shove them in our optical stems. Seriously you suck as a director and can't understand what brain dead executive or anyone in Hollywood thinks you are talented. Please do the world a favor go learn how to weld metals without using a welding hood. Be sure to keep your eyes open and you will forever see the lens flares you get off on so much.,1
5364,3.0,"To call this movie insufferable would be inaccurate, because I suffered through it. I wish I could claim I was a begrudged fan, unfortunately that is not the case. If I was a begrudged fan, that would mean that maybe this movie could be subjectively good through another's eyes-unfortunately that is not the case. My hope for this series died out with the last, arguably worse film. This film is bad because it is predictable, plot driven dribble. This movie is bad because the characters, who were set up to be interesting, became archetypal cartoon versions of characters that would have been interesting. This movie is bad because they focused on catering to the formula than catering to the audience themselves. Although this movie will sell gangbusters, the audience is going to catch on to the formula . . . and all of our beloved franchises will die with them.",0

DOnt like that They does so much call back to original movies, and not Prequel but sure there was some Prequel stuff in voice acting. Again Rey goes against Kylo, and of course, she defeats him... Dont think he never ever took her down. And we Saw Rey kicking Lukes ass in TLJ and this time Luke gets ass kicked by his own sister Leia during training montage. What is it about all these weak men?",0

The older star wars are way better then the new movies that they have now. Watch another movie instead there are better ones. This was there ending to star wars to me that was pathetic and a bad ending. Don't believe in the people and the critics that enjoy this movie please give a bad rating to this. The story, characters and everything was bad all together. The movie did not flow instead it was all over the place which does not help any one.

Its very rushed, there's many plot holes, it breaks the lore in some places, and the third act is just very bad. It feels so chopped together and meaningless. Every major moment of the story that holds weight is quickly undone without consequence. Its weird they actually released the movie and didnt just scrap it and remake it. Its that bad.",0
5371,1.0,It is the worst movie ever made. That is all. Because I need to give more substance I will say It is bad. So bad. The chacarters have no soul.<br /><br />It is a B minus movie. A C movie or maybe a D movie. Junk. It is just junk.,0

5375,3.0,"I am a hard core Star Wars fan and I liked all Star Wars content, except the Holiday Star Wars Special and Rise of Skywalker. Actually, I would compare Rise of Skywalker to the Holiday Star Wars Special in the 70's. The third film of the sequel trilogy is out of place with the first two. There is no build up from the prior films for Palpatines introduction and the film was all over the place in terms of story. Emotional gut punches for the fake death of Chewie, fake memory wipe of C3PO, and the ridiculous name change of Rey Skywalker. The idea that she is a Palpatine is good, but there was poor execution in the delivery of her origins. I found Palpatine in the Outer Regions hanging out for 30 years completely ridiculous. A cloned Snoke emerging would have been an interesting concept and the Knights of Ren should have been developed more. I came out of this move disappointed in what JJ Abrams did and the Star Wars franchise in general. Please, do not go see this movie and wait for it digitally/Blu Ray, because a message needs to be sent that Disney needs to stop making bad Star Wars content, like Solo and Rise of Skywalker.",0

5377,7.0,"The storyline is 1000% better than the last jedi, it makes sense in the context of the force awakens which i would give a solid 7.5-8 as a standalone. In many ways this movie makes TLJ basically un-necessary including its absurd plot twists like quick snoke death and silly space chase hyperdrive suicide. Honestly 20 minutes of TLJ where rey meets luke and him sacrificing himself tacked onto this movie would have done alot more for the new trilogy than Rian Johnson's catastrophe.",0
5378,7.0,"Not a masterpiece, but definitely not the utter crap some people make it to be. The movie has great moments, a few meh moments, and a couple WTF, super cringy moments... But it's a proper send off to characters we've loved for 42 years. I usually intensely dislike JJ's style, but I must say in this movie, he did a very good job. It's visually stunning, entertaining, and the fan service is intense but smarter than in TFA, so it's not as disturbing. Don't believe people who say you will love this if you hated TLJ. I loved TLJ for what it tried to accomplish, I thought TFA was pretty bad overall, and I think this one is pretty good and stands on proper foundations to make a good Star Wars movie. Could it be better ? All movies have flaws. Is it worth seeing in the theater ? Absolutely.",1

And what a conclusion... i cried , for sadness and also for joy. I had the pleasure, nostalgic one, to remember the original trilogy and also to finally to like the characters of this new one.<br /><br />It was a big pleasure seeing this movie.

The task of fixing wrongs and culminating 8 movies into one was huge. I think he did a fantastic job. I left the theater wanting to see it again. It left me sad because it's the end of a saga and the way he incorporated Leia into this movie was astounding. I'm sure people will give it bad reviews because I think they may live in some weird reality. Lol. It's a fun exciting ride for 2 1/2 hours. Thank you Thank you Thank you JJ Abrams for this wonderful Christmas present!",1
5390,9.0,It ties up many lose ends. Doesn't go against the star wars univers too much. It kind of fixes the horror that is the last jedi. It's a push on the concepts regarding the force. It's a good ending to the skywalker saga although not the best.,1

Why? because of the new norm of critics vs. fans. Of late, there has been a growing divide between audience scores and critic scores, and the movies I normally end up loving are the ones where the audience score is higher. I don't go to a movie to analyze every single detail about the movie going experience, or the political undertones of a movie, or the inclusivity of some random minority group somewhere.

It's very Rey-centric, who I happen to like but if you don't it might not be your favorite. I was also unfulfilled by the twist of her parentage. Didn't see it coming and didn't appreciate it. She was also very different in this movie, very empathetic and sensitive to other beings, which showed her character development but it was such a departure that it was a bit strange. Luke was strange in the role too; just didn't seem like Luke. Didn't like Leia in the last 3 though either. She's a good character and there were some touching, heart-warming parts as well.",1
5396,3.0,"One of the greatest sagas in movie history ends with an enjoyable space boom. Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver performs well and Ian McDermid in his evil form is always quite entertaining. There is no question that this movie cannot match the original trilogy in any way. But when looking at the new trilogy, it concluded in an entertaining way and did pay hommage to the original trilogy. While Last Jedi had incredible visuals, the script left this old SW fan a bit disappointed and confused. The Rise Of Skywalker picks up the pieces and answers questions - though it is not perfect, it sort of gives glue to the cracks of new trilogy left by The Last Jedi (similar to Kylo's helmet) and left me very entertained and somewhat satisfied.",1
5397,5.0,YI tried to review this 3 days ago as I saw this in Indonesia. Better than the last one but so many implausible moments. No character development. Reminder me of last season of game of thrones. Everything felt rushed. Some good and funny moments but after you feel a little empty like after eating a Chinese meal. Could be better but also could be worse like the the last jedi,0
5398,5.0,"One thing i have noticed in almost all Disney properties is how even the bad ones have rating on IMDb all conveniently stack up to minimum 7 (Aladdin, The Lion King 2019, and this one) i remember all of them having below 7 yet now they all have at least 7. Ratings usually comes down over time not the other way round. Maybe a coincidence.",0
5399,1.0,"This movie was a just another failure in a long line of Disney's attempts to make a movie that makes everyone happy and gives them a ton of cash. The whole plot of this movie seemed like some one spit balled a bunch of ideas and they put them in the movie and went through it as fast as they could. When I was watching the movie and I heard how dumb some of the lines sounded I wanted to vomit, i thought to my self is there any hope for a another good star wars movie? Maybe that is the case and I should just be content with the first 6 but maybe there is still hope. If you are a star wars fan and want to see this movie wait till it comes out of theaters it is not worth your money.",0

5402,7.0,"Hi Simon and Mark,<br /><br />I went to see The Rise Of Skywalker yesterday with my wife, 19 year old son and 13 year old autistic son. We are all massive Star Wars fans and were so excited that the movie had finally arrived. Are overall feelings were that it was about a 7/10 and very much a missed opportunity. They simply tried to cram far too much into one movie probably as they were committed to ending the series on the 9th episode. This meant that the film felt like a series of set pieces rather than a story unwinding. It also meant that many new entries into the Star Wars world just didn't have the time to settle into the film. i.e. D-0 and Zori Bliss, they just appear without any introduction and the director assumes we will just add them to the clan without complaining. The acrobatic jump that Rey does in the desert is far more thrilling in the trailer and the moment when C-3PO says goodbye to his friends is also much sadder in the trailer, work that one out. The incredibly dangerous journey across the skyscraper sized waves could and should have been far more exciting and thrilling but once again it was skipped over like it was a walk in the park... and the second time we don't even see it! I know this is a spoiler but the appearance of Solo IS by far the highlight of the film and it says everything about the stature and charisma of Harrison Ford that apart from Daisey Ridley and Adam Driver nobody else comes near for movie presence in this move although I have to admit Richard E. Grant is very good. The climatic ending just about saves the film mainly down to the performances of Ridley and Driver. The one huge negative was the same sex kiss mainly because it stood out like a sore thumb and took us all out of the moment like great big alarm bells announcing the obligatory politically correct moment! If it's set in an undefined time in the future why does it have to relate to Earth in 2019? Surely that's the point of Sci-fi isn't it? For eight movies the Star Wars universe has been securely anchored and now you tell me that lesbianism has just come into fashion? They could have saved it for the next franchise and left the nine intact but I suppose they couldn't help themselves. Shame.<br /><br />Malcolm Middleton.",1
5403,10.0,I have no idea what all the bad reviews are for. He ended Star Wars with the best one ever made. I pretend episodes 1 2 and 3 by George Lucas never happened. Thank You JJ Abrams! This was an amazing ride. I was not much of a fan of Rhians episode 8 but still better then the Phantom Menace and the other 2 prequels that was a joke. Anyways dont listen to any of the bad 1 and 2 star reviews they dont know how to make a movie. I would like to see any of them direct anything. Watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am and always will be a huge star wars fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
5404,1.0,This was a pointless poorly written movie which feels like it was made from the leftovers of a whiteboard from previous movies.<br /><br />It is a group of stereotypes chasing macguffins and collecting convenient cliches along the way taking risks as they go with no no significant consequences.<br /><br />Resolutions to problems are created in such a way that makes it feel like a Star Trek movie.<br /><br />I facepalmed so many times watching this movie that my forehead has changed shape. It really feels more like FanFiction or Legends rather than true Star wars Canon. Not only is it the worst Star wars movie I have ever seen it is the worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Seriously don't waste your time.,0

5406,9.0,"Star Wars was and alway will be about action, adventure, great space battles, 'sword fights', hokey human characters, weird aliens, even weirder dialogue, cantinas, tongue in cheek humour and a touch of inspiration from Kurusawa thrown in for good measure. All wrapped up in a beautiful John Williams score. The whole concept is 'Saturday morning serial' and this has it all in droves. Pure magical escapism to another world (or 5) for a couple of hours. For me, it's a fitting end - until they make the next three! ;)",1

There is nothing wrong with this film. Loose ends are tied, non stop action, occasional melodrama, some nostalgia and a reasonable ending. Just go in, switch off and enjoy the film. And don't be a Star Wars snob. Job done. Still better than any other series of films because of the variety of content.",0

They actually wrapped up 9 not 3 movies in The Rise of Skywalker with a pleasant, emotional and exciting (even if not brilliant) finish. I was pleasantly surprised after reading all the very negative reviews. I guess I should not have been surprised because I have found the story of Rey and Kylo to be the best parts of this trilogy. Almost everything else was really just mediocre or bad. The whole trilogy could be edited down to one good movie about them.",1

5420,8.0,"I see a lot of people had problems with resurrection of others here, because it was never done... I think it was never done in the past because the Jedi don't believe in personal attachments. Rey bringing Ben back to life had nothing to do with attachments, in my opinion. It had more to do with her realizing that she made a mistake, did something wrong and wanted to fix it. I think she immediately felt Leia. It was her compassion, not her fear of loss, or attachments, is why she was successful.<br /><br />Because she wasn't trained by the Jedi order, she was never taught that you shouldn't have attachments or try to revive someone back to life.<br /><br />Ben tried it cause he saw Rey do it.<br /><br />YAnd ya, the whole Palpatine resurrection was dumb but it is what it is. His being able to die so easily was dumb, too, but it sure was cool to watch.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm having trouble imagining anyone ever wanting to sleep with him! Eewww I think even before he was hideous, he was still ugly! 😆<br /><br />There's a whole bunch left to say but I just wanted to focus on the point of reviving a life. Even Rey's healing of the snake monster thing was out of compassion. I found her compassion to be beautiful.<br /><br />My rating is 8/10 to balance out all those 1/10's. I think the music and effects alone deserve more than an 1/10, jeez people!",1
5421,10.0,"When George Lucas created Star Wars he did it for one reason - to bring fun back to the cinema; something he called 'effervescent giddiness'.

5427,4.0,"Star Wars was a franchise that used to spark excitement and unity among the fans of the films, and new generations. Sadly, it seems like that spark is fading away. Force Awakens got me excited for what was to come, Last Jedi was a bit different but I still enjoyed some aspects of the movie. Rise of Skywalker had the perfect amount of nostalgia while also being a super fun movie that was intense, action packed, had beautiful camera work, and a good story. Since the reviews are all over the place, it seems like critics and fans are divided once more. To get your own opinion, go see the movie and decide what you think.

WTF why is ALWAYS he thinking he has to try and ""rescue"" Rey. She's basically a Jedi and can use the force. That was just ridiculous and annoying. His character has no purpose after the first film as he mostly just gets in the way. Jar jar as a stormtrooper deserter. Ugh.",0
5434,6.0,"Nevertheless the poor scoring reviews I'd read I thought I'd give it a shot and go watch anyway. I've seen 2-8 in the cinema for better and worse, so why not. I must say the first part of the movie entertained me, it didn't blow me away. Towards the end of the second half the story build up completely disappeared. If Ren just died when Rey stabbed him with her lightsabre it would have been pretty good and the story could continue in some manner, preferably with her becoming a Sith. Now it became Disney Land. What a shame. I'm glad the Mandalorian came along although it feels as if they'll manage to ruin this line of filming too. Stick to true story telling Disney. The Star Wars universe is big enough for everyone.",0

I walked, maybe stumbled, out theater thinking; wow that made since! I've read the ""new canyon"" books, watched the Clone Wars, and loved the Rebels. No one needs to talk about Mandalorian.. we all like that. This movie fits. The Last Jedi didn't leave room to make all fans happy and there was a lot of questions and anger with empty story plots that needed to be filled. The Rise of Skywalker was rushed. Yes. I need more dialog and a two part movie would have been great now that I am into it. But in George Lucas basic a@$ 1977 Star Wars that left everyone with a bunch of questions then, it makes since. It's a balance to the force. It's the yin and the yang. What about the dots in the yin and the yang!!? This balance is deeper than what he copied off of a ancient Chinese Philosophy. We always knew about the dark and light side of the force but payed no attention to the true balance. Ren ending up being the light dot and Ray being the dark dot. Ren being influenced by the light around him but feeling the darkness inside and Ray surrounded by the light but feeling the darkness. It's really a beautiful picture no one will ever get..

Be fun, exciting, full of action with characters you care about. This has all that. The negative reviews are often adults in their late 40s / early 50s who watched Star Wars as a child and now want the same feeling. Truth is, you can't because you are watching it from an adult perspective, you are analysing every scene, and coming out with comments such as, that's impossible, daft, the physics is wrong, the force can't do that, that character wouldn't do that etc. You know what, when you were a child, you watched it, enjoyed it, then went to play with the action figures.<br /><br />I'm in my mid 40s but watched it for what it was supposed to be, and I will in future watch it again.",1

I think JJ has pulled the rabbit out of the hat and produced a Star Wars movie that most hardened cynics couldn't help but like. I agree with Mark Kermode on Radio One when he said that the scenes featuring Carrie Fisher look like they were written to fit what footage they had and yes seeing her in those scenes does seem a little odd as it doesn't quite fit but it works imo. We had to have Leigh in this film and it was far more fitting & decent to have not gone down the Rogue One process of replicating her. I love this film but I need to see it again (and again and again) to see whether the emotion has clouded my judgement. In saying that, now after just seeing it for the first time, I think it's the best Star Wars film after IV & V. Wonderful. 9/10.",1

5472,6.0,Star wars the rise of Skywalker is a visually stylish film of the year better then any blockbusters released this year but that's it. It's a typical heroes journey nothing else it doesn't even felt like star wars untill when the climax hits everything the story puts we all have seen countless times palpatine is like blofeld controlling the villains from the previous films just like Spectre and kylo Ren and rey's minds are wrapped just like Harry Potter and Voldemort and palpatine must get killed so that the sith power will go to Rey just like hocruxes they just swapped it this similarities maybe uncanny but it is very overwhelming to notice and then how Rey is a palpatine I don't have any clue and how kylo Ren is betraying palpatine if palpatine is so powerfull he could have sensed but no the power cinema compells palpatine so that kylo Ren can save Rey and Rey is like the character of frozen or Harry Potter will do all the stuff alone so that nobody can get hurt I mean what!. The last Jedi tried to be different and there was concerns but that movie felt like star wars the sheer unpredictable nature of the universe is what we were expecting from star wars. And carry Fischer's untimely death was a tragedy but jj Abrams respectfully created the illusion of her when she was interacting with Rey but still the ratio was quite unrealistic when she was talking to Rey or Poe nevertheless the filmmakers did give her a nice tribute not a great one but was nice. The only good thing in the movie are Oscar Issac and Adam driver both delivered power pack performances and because of them I watched it till the end. Then there was a heartfelt cameo which was the only emotional part of the movie. The cinematography the vfx everything is top notch no doubt but still there was so impact in the movie that is just disappointing. Kids will love It though,1

5479,7.0,"I was born in 1971. I was 7 or 8 when I saw A New Hope in theaters, me and my older brother saw the original trilogy (ep. 4-6) with our dad. It was something that ""formed"" us... we grew up with this. Then 16 years later, as a young man, I saw the second trilogy (ep. 1-3) with my friends and I was much more developed as a film fan than as a young boy. I had strong opinions about it and generally I felt let down, even though I enjoyed it very much. Hayden appearing in the end of Return of the Jedi though in the new edition of the old trilogy was not a great choice. Cut to the new trilogy (ep. 7-9) ... I really enjoyed The Force Awakens. It felt strongly as a remake of A New Hope but I love J.J. Abrams works and he didn't disappoint. The Last Jedi was a let down and now ... at the conclusion of the Skywalker saga ... I feel ... strange.",1
5480,6.0,"After the debacle with episode VIII, also known as ""the most boring space race in movie history"", I could not have had lower expectations. for ""The Rise of Skywalker"".<br /><br />Which is likely why I managed to enjoy this movie, for the most part.<br /><br />The good: It's an actual Adventure movie. Finally!!! The team of heroes goes and looks for stuff, there's some mystery, there's an artifact, there's some fun not knowing what happens next.<br /><br />This is however, the end of the ""good"" part.",1

5482,5.0,"I'm not a fan of Star Wars. I enjoy the Star Trek reboots, for the most part. I'm one of the few that liked Rogue One, so that should tell you of my qualifications for reviewing Star Wars. I enjoyed it because I was with my fiancée and she's awesome. But I struggled with all the sudden, surprise saves. I mean, yes, that must be the Star Wars way but every save came from someone finally stepping up or showing up at the last possible second. And why, after so long, can Stormtroopers not hit their targets? Anyone remember when Poe was shot? Neither did he, apparently.",0
5483,8.0,"I´ve read through some reviews befor writing this (especially the low rated once).<br /><br />Let me be clear. Rian Jonssons attempt makes me cringe every time I think of it. Perhaps this is why I like this one so much. Why not a 10/10 then? Well there are a few issues; most of them regarding time. I can´t really explain it without spoilers but to me these errors are only a mild nuisance. Also, a few scenes ar rushed by without any real explanation; and some crucial and/or interesting.<br /><br />The biggest flaw for me is the ""force long-distance call and interaction"" we saw in TLJ. It leaves me with one big question mark. What are the ""rules"" and boundries? Admittedly it´s a leftover from Rian ""¤*%&"" Jonsson (yeah I really don´t like him) but JJ didn´t really improve on the idea. Pitty.<br /><br />That being said, this installment is indeed redemption. Redemtion for most fans. in some way for George Lucas, and mostly for Mark Hamill. While a ghost obviously, Luke is once more the man we (and very much Mark Hamill) thought him to be. Less a grumpy old has-been and more the strong, optimistic Luke we want to see. Some elements could have been elaborated more but we do get asnwers to most of our questions. Granted some will probably not be satisfied but I do think JJ did a great job considering the mess after TLJ. Yes he stole some from both Empire and Jedi as he did with Hope in his first film. But while TFA felt a bit of a rip off, here it felt like a good and somewhat poetic way to come full circle. I left the theatre with about the same feeling as efter Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />If you are a true Star Wars fan, you will enjoy it.",1
5484,10.0,An avid Star Wars fan old enough to have followed the story through from its very first release. I went to see this with expectations at an all time low having read so many negative reviews but how wrong were they!! A true emotional roller coaster of a movie of epic proportions which will take you from the edge of your seat to crying in your popcorn. It's a fitting end to the Star Wars saga and I just loved it!,1
5485,1.0,I'm glad that my girlfriend and I prefer to watch joker rather than this on theater. My family and I grew to love to watch this franchise but I dont know what Kathleen Kennedy do this franchise movie ever since she step up as president of Lucas film.,1
5486,8.0,"So, reading the reviews on here and it is very clear that the people all moaning and complaining about various things (mostly Disney filling their pockets) all seem to have one thing in common, they contributed to it. If they didn't, how can they possibly make an informed review on the film.",1
5487,2.0,"If this is the ultimate result of nearly 3 decades of political correctness, then the movement failed society.",0
5488,1.0,"This movie was the worst of the three sequels, and that's saying something. The character development is awful, specially for Finn. They hyped him up so much as a stormtrooper who was force sensitive, only to have him scream ""Rey!"" the whole movie. They did John Boyega dirty, but he did an excellent job with what they gave him. In the end (as Boyega said), Disney followed the typical stereotype of black characters in films. I'm also really sad for Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, both amazing actors with really bad scripts. The movie overall didn't make sense (not surprised) and it all looks really patched. It contradicts a lot of what happened in the original trilogy and the prequels. That Skywalker final part was really disappointing and unnerving. At least this trilogy finally ended. I hope that Disney learns from this big mistake and starts doing better Star Wars content, like The Mandalorian, that isn't just a redo of past films.",0
5489,5.0,Last Jedi hurt the story they try it to salvage it creating a mediocre movie with plot holes and inconsistencies and a fan service check list make sequels look like masterpieces The sequels have their shortcomings but at least they were original and tried things,0
5490,4.0,"...this was just a bad movie. I appreciate the Jedi, Sith, Force, Lightsabers, etc... but the writing, acting, dialogue, and directing were SO BAD (almost as bad as Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but not quite).And new characters are pointless now. J.J. had a tough job trying to put an ending to Star Wars, especially after the Last Jedi, but I think he just threw in the towel at one point and went for a corporate action flick with a 42 year old history.",0
5491,6.0,What surprised me the most about this movie was the inconsistancy.,1
5492,8.0,Expectations werent high going into this after my disappointment with the last jedi but thankfully I felt justice has been done. Started off as a sprint for the first 20 minutes with a lot of jumping around but soon settled with a decent flow of action and story telling. New charectors worked and just the right amount of laughs and giggles. Didn't see the big rey reveal coming which was good and ended with everything wrapped up. Well done disney.,0

5495,8.0,"I was worried about this movie being horrible because the early reviews were so negative but I enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker. It had a few rough spots but was over all enjoyable. I think they did the very best they could with Leias charecter. I was a little disappointed that Reys heritage was changed, I had liked the idea of her coming from no one important and still being so powerful. Ben Solos story was handled well. I loved a certain surprise cameo. I think the early critics nit picked a good movie to death.",1
5496,10.0,Glad to see they tied things up in this one. They played homage to the beginning fairly well. Takes me back to 1977 when I first fell in love with Star Wars as a 10yr old kid. I Loved it and will watch at least a couple more times in the theater before buying for home.,1
5497,10.0,"Star Wars was great. The only reasons you would not like the movie: You have unrealistic expectations, You love TLJ more than any film in the history of films and hate all other Star Wars movies, or you have unrealistic expectations. Honorable mention to those who just don't care for Star Wars because you probably shouldn't see it. I have no interest in watching any Kardashian show, but if I watched one, I wouldnt talk about how poorly acted/written/scripted/fake unscripted it was, i would just know what I was getting myself into. Was it perfect? No. Could it have been? No. Rian Johnson made sure this movie would have impurities.",0
5498,6.0,"The things with this movie is that it felt rush and had lack of stakes, also the editing at the first half is kinda messy like they didnt know what to put into, but the fact that there are some good moments especially with Kylo Rens character redeems it a little for me, and some scenes with Rey have emotion, most of the movie doesnt make a lot of sense but it has a finality to some of the arks shown in force awakens, also it has a lot of dissapointing things, but its not as bad as Attack of the clones or even Phantom Menace, but the most dissapointing aspect of the film are the miss use of characters like Lando, C3PO, Luke, and even the emperor himself, his scenes werent that good being honest, he was like a puppet, but well at least Kylo had some finality to his story.",0
5499,1.0,"Okay I'm sorry guys but the whole movie feels like a cartoon. Everything is just so made up and fake. Like good guys just have to win l, you don't feel bad for anyone, you are not worried about Rey loosing. She is just so good and perfect.",0
5500,8.0,"Despite critic reviews and audience bashing, make the decision for yourself I implore you.",0
5501,2.0,"If you are a casual fan and judge it as a standalone movie. The visuals are great, the soundtrack is on point, and the scene is more intimidating than the last two movies. However, if we were to judge it as a part of a larger story that the movie ties itself to, then it is perhaps the WORST Star Wars movies in terms of plot. This is not a hyperbole. The movie is filled with retcons and bad plot twists that don't make sense and just exist for the sake of introducing a twist. Let us explore some of the bigger ones (This is going to be long so strap on)",0
5502,,This film does things I appreciate like having Rey train and...<br /><br />Now that I think of it Rey is the major problem with this film. While the writing isn't insulting like Force Awakens it's predictable and tiresome. Also Rey Is a Mary Sue don't @ me,0
5503,9.0,"This was not an easy thing to do! The respectful way that this ties in every leg of the saga that came before it without lending to any of its shortfalls has to earn JJ Abrams absolute fan loyalty! This is nothing short of the best way to end a series, a trilogy and a legacy in the the Star Wars universe. I will be going back again and again!",1
5504,2.0,"I can think of one or two good things about this movie, but it certainly doesn't compare with all the downsides of it. As a fan of the Star Wars original saga (even the prequels), Rise of the Skywalker just makes me sad, especially because they rip off the Anakin redemption arch with the Palpatine revival. Ugh, I just hated the movie.",1
5505,9.0,"Honestly WAY better than I thought it would be. Tied up loose ends, righted many wrongs, felt like a true Star Wars movie again. I loved it.",1
5506,1.0,"I enjoyed the film, it had a good few Star Wars feels. I'd began to dislike the new heroes after the awful TLJ but this film shows that given a bit more care and planning from Disney we could have had some decent new heroes. Unfortunately the trilogy wasn't planned well at all, no thought or heart was really there from the off. But like I say this definitely goes some way to right the wrongs of the horrific 2nd film and if we had perhaps gotten JJ Abrams, who I'm not a massive fan of, three picture cohesion then the films wouldn;t be so down in peoples estimation. So overall I was surprised and enjoyed JJ's attempt to put a plaster over the wound of the second. It's just a shame they had so little planning for such a cherished property and needed to roll out the Scotch tape to patch things up.",1
5507,9.0,"I'm sometimes find it fascinating that fans feel like they own the sole viewpoint on the direction a franchise should go, and when it doesn't happen the way they feel it should, they say the movie is bad. I liked things that happened in TFA, and I liked things in TLJ. I didn't like everything, but who wants to watch a movie with no surprises? I loved this movie. I'm not saying it's perfect, but I love the storytelling enough to forgive some of the flaws. An honest look at the original films reveals all sorts of issues with acting, story, and pacing, not to mention the obvious marketing ploy of the Ewok characters. Yet I love them because I saw them as a child and could get lost in the story. TROS is not a perfect movie, but if you go into it with a bit of child-like wonder (something severely lacking in almost every professional critic), you will love this movie, too. I would advise everyone to remember that critics are paid to find flaws so that they can up the drama, and many regular cinephiles that submit critiques feed on the drama of tearing apart someone else's creative endeavors. This is my second or third review ever, but I just feel like most of the people tearing apart this movie are actually just a rabid vocal minority who feel like everyone should be as critical as they are. It's a story made to entertain. Relax and enjoy it instead of nit picking it because it's not as thought provoking as you think it should be. Let a story be a story. One last word to those who said the film references backwards too much instead of looking to the future. George Lucas based his story on the work of Joseph Campbell and his theory that cultures across the world respond to common mythological characters and motifs. It was the secret of Lucas' success. TROS refers back to all those same motifs because that is what makes Star Wars what it is: an enjoyable story. Relax and enjoy it.",1

No film is without its flaws and some events were slightly predictable but in no way does that take away from how fun the film is. In my own opinion I enjoyed it throughly and felt very much apart of the engaging story. It all culminated in an amazing third and final act that shaked and defined the Skywalker story, and through the tears in my eyes I witnessed the end of the biggest franchise in the world.",1
5510,10.0,Perfection- spiritually true. Emotionally true. Well acted. Thoroughly enjoyable. Echoes of Tolkien. Nods to Dune. I need to see several more times.,1
5511,6.0,"Alright, people. I think we need to stop doing what we think is cool and just look at things realistically: we already knew where Star Wars was headed when Disney bought it from Lucas, and the expectations for this entire Sequel Trilogy were set with the release of The Force Awakens.<br /><br />I am a huge Star Wars fan. I absolutely LOVE the original trilogy, and I've come to really like the prequel trilogy.<br /><br />I've read almost every book in the new canon set by Disney, and a lot of the books that are being labeled as ""Legends"" after Disney took over.<br /><br />When I watched The Force Awakens I wasn't blown away by originality or any great character development, but the effects were good and it was nice to be back in the world of Star Wars.<br /><br />The Last Jedi was less than satisfactory for me, and probably the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen, especially because a lot of times it made no sense at all, and I felt like it ruined a lot of it by adding unnecessary humor where it didn't need to be. I saw it opening night and I only watched it for the second time when I was rewatching all the Star Wars movies before I went to see The Rise of Skywalker and I enjoyed it more the second time I watched it because the way I looked at it was a sort of thrill ride - you have great CGI, you have a lot of beautiful shots that do nothing to the story, and you are just sort of observing nonsense that makes no sense to the actual story but you enjoy it nevertheless because it's familiar.",1

So many divided fans due merely to the fact some follow the trend of bashing to be heard and others can not take their own mind to comprehend the movie itself. They'd rather someone else make their mind up for them. Sort of like news today. Bottom line is that this movie was absolutely incredible. It paid respect to each film in subtle ways. Humor that goes a long way throughout. Even Easter eggs many will miss due to their perceived outlook on what they wanted rather than what it is. The movie is quite frankly above the rest for me. I actually left the theater loving this movie more than the rest.",1

Considering the heap of issues it had to resolve from the last one, JJ did an excellent job at making an enjoyable storyline and keeping the whole thing entertaining. Whilst fast paced at times, this is more than understandable since they needed to redo half of the last movie too! I've spent almost the whole of the Disney franchise hating Kylo, and not in a good way. Sometimes there are villains you love to hate, Kylo wasn't one of these. I just hated him. And I've never switched my opinion on a character so fast that in this movie. It wasn't even down to the twist that happens, I loved him from the start. From an annoying character, JJ has made a genuinely sympathetic and confused guy. Loved it!",1

This throws off people who have been star wars fans for years, which I understand. Was it the greatest star wars? No. But I was pleased to see JJ back for this one.

I agree with another reviewer nostalgia for the originals lead us to forget that there were plot holes and cheesy dialogue and it wasn't perfect.

It is faster paced than any of the previous films, and crams a lot in to the first 20 minutes. Most of the TV spot and trailer clips are from very early scenes. But it sets up well for a worthwhile conclusion. Reading other reviews, I think some supposed ""fans"" have forgotten that this franchise is a fantasy, set in a galaxy, far far away. The twists that JJ expect us to believe in this film are pure fantasy. As fantastical as a sword made from laser beam. 42 years of stories, concluding in an emotional and action packed film. I loved it.",1

""wow I know, how about this: bring it to to life the Evil one from the entire SW saga?""... no comment... I know.<br /><br />Can we say that they ran out of argument? without creativity? there was no other way? anything better?<br /><br />But hey, you have to think that it's another Star Wars, not the classic science fiction film that Gerge Lucas created in the late 70s.<br /><br />We have a plus one: the technological development that Disney has must be celebrated. The special effects are really wonderful and some scenes are enjoyable. That is why I give my 2 rating points.",1
5558,3.0,I never thought a Star Wars movie would make me miss the Phantom Menace but this one just did some how. This is one of the worst movies that I've ever paid to go watch. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and while I didn't think the new trilogy held up to the original one I certainly enjoyed the first two films and was looking forward to this one as well.,0
5559,5.0,Oh dear.<br /><br />No rhythm...no intimacy...brain dead desperate plot line with cringeworthy twists.<br /><br />Poor direction making some of the acting look hammy.<br /><br />Felt vacuous and rudderless - found myself wishing the deathstar would come along and end it all.,0
5560,10.0,"This is a very good movie, I loved the story and the production team did a very good job. The post production is amazing ! I would recommend this to any one who love science fiction, it is the trilogy to see. I can understand that some people may dislike the 4, 5, 6 but this one was just... amazing.",1
5561,10.0,"Im very imprsssive with starwars,if starwars ends so my life is end...Iam growth with starwars , hard to carry on 😭 it has everythings in it !",0
5562,9.0,"People are very hateful is regards to movies now a days, and intern more people hate with out having their own opinion. I did my very best to go into this move with a unbiased and open mind......... and I'm glad that I did. This was very quite possibly my favorite of the ""new"" movies. Now it is not without is fault as most movies are, but the happy awesome and sad parts definitely make up for it. I will gladly watch it again, and cant wait to do so.<br /><br />In closing, dont listen the haters and go to enjoy the movie and you will love it.",1
5563,7.0,"I saw the original the summer it opened in 1977. I was 8. I got the toys, the T shirts, the drinking glasses at Burger King. I became a fan for life. But not one of the many nitpicky obsessive fans/haters who were spawned somewhere between the prequels and now. TROS is a fun movie. Is Palpatine's resurrection explained? No. Are there plot holes big enough to drive a Star Destroyer through? Sure. Is the final space battle realistic? Uh, is any space battle realistic? It's Star Wars. It's a fun time at the movies. Check it out.",1
5564,2.0,"I felt very disappointed.<br /><br />It didn't look cheep, the Aktion and the special effects were fine.<br /><br />But like in the last season of Game of thrones, thing that happened before ""rise of skywalke"", are just ignored.<br /><br />The Acting is bad and the story seems flat and rushed.<br /><br />I kind of liked the Force awakening and I honestly loved Rouge One, but this mess, is just as bad as The last Jedi.<br /><br />Maybe they should give Jon Favreau a try on the next Star Wars movie. He is doing a pretty good job with Mandalorian, in my point of view.",0
5565,10.0,So I will simply say this: forget the haters. This was a great flick.,1
5566,10.0,"I personally loved it. It was very well-made, looked super real, had great dialogue, and contained lots of great scenes. No movie will ever please some of these star wars fans, they overlook the amazing parts of the movies and whine about the nitpicky things until they end up hating the movie.",1
5567,10.0,"You can read this review however you like, but I watched this film on my own, without anyone's bias and I was not disappointed at all. I think, whether you like this film or not, depends entirely on what Star Wars means to you. Star Wars to me has always been about seeing Jedi kick ass and pulling off some incredible new feats along the way. All I wanted from this trilogy was to see Rey become a powerful Jedi that they made her out to be in the beginning, and that's what I got. Seeing her pull the ship out of the sky with the electric force thingy was great (sorry, don't know what it's called), her being able to heal, the redemption of Ben sly walker, and then in the end when all the Jedi came to her as one I thought was very exciting and entertaining to watch.",1
5568,5.0,"To be honest, it is a very good movie if it was a stand alone movie. However when you think that how they ruined the skywalker story from the very beginning of these new series, you just get sad and frustrated.",1
5569,1.0,"This movie offends one's intelligence. Big, smelly dump on the original franchise",0
5570,10.0,This is a fantastic film the critics have no clue what there talking about everyone should go see it and judge it for themselves you won't be disappointed,1
5571,6.0,"They spent so much money on special effects, which by the way were great and maybe the only good thing in this movie, along with some lightsaber fights and Palpatines physical appearance,<br /><br />and they couldn't hire 1-2 good Writers to write a descent script?!..<br /><br />And maybe a better Director..<br /><br />Ok..JJ Abrams had a quite difficult task, he took over again, continuing from the mess Rian Johnson created..but he managed to make an even worse! sequel..",0
5572,9.0,"As a whole, The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting epic conclusion to this amazing saga. Don't believe for a second that this movie is worse than the prequels. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver especially give powerful performances each showing how their friends and family influence the side they belong on. That's not to saw a few slip ups occur throughout. The way is which Palpatine returned is especially annoying to not see an explanation. New characters introduced will most likely be forgotten after they exit the screen. But overall a satisfying end to the epic saga strung together with exceptional directing and story.",1
5573,9.0,"I liked it, the visual effects, the photography, the score, it seems as if it was trying to hit some marks, but other than that I felt the director really cared about the original material, and put time and attention into the story and how to close it.",1
5574,3.0,"As a heads up, I'm a strictly neutral. I haven't watched any star wars films since phantom menace. But I could see this film was laden with Easter eggs. It's a film for the fans with throwbacks to give you a feel good feeling like seeing Lando again. It's a big sci fi costume melodrama and oh boy, the costumes had a lot of thought going into it.",1
5575,6.0,"When you watch this you will be reminded of the old batman series where they were in peril for the total of the commercial break and then suddenly everything was okay again. That happens in this film constantly throughout. It is rediculous how rushed each scenario is. Oh such and such is dead, oh hang on...they aren't. The falcon is burning, no it's fixed. They are all doomed, then thirty seconds later, oh no they aren't. I can;t go nto details of the later film but again half an hour of normal movie is covered in about ten. There is no time to absorb what is going on. It is just far too rushed. Either sumplify things or make the film longer. The whole trilogy was a mistake that they are just sweeping under the carpet with some nostalgia and special effects.",0
5576,10.0,Amazing end to the series. Almost all lose ends are tied up. Twists and turns in the story I didnt see coming. Fantastic,1
5577,8.0,"The only spoiler in this review is actually a spoiler from The Last Jedi. Why on god's earth did Disney let RJ kill off Luke Skywalker. It makes me so angry that it happened and it was a pointless move, absolute narrow minded misstep no matter how RJ tries to spin it. Anyway, I only say this because this film was pretty much as good as it could be, a real Star Wars film, but would have been perfect if Luke was in it to see it through. The running time ensured every subplot could be played out in good order, a few scenes that didn't need to be in there but overall I enjoyed it immensely. New and old characters came together and it worked perfectly. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it being the definitive end to the orginal characters that my childhood was so intertwined with but I do know I can now appreciate the whole series, yes even the prequels (!), as I know there will be no more new additions to come. Well done to JJ Abrams who made two fantastic films and to George Lucas who has quite literally affected my life in a way nothing else could.",1
5578,10.0,"As a fan and critic to episode 7 and 8 which seemed not to show what we expected from star wars nor the plot nor the results, episode 9 comes to resolve everything we have been expecting and connecting all the dots from all the movies together.<br /><br />Emotional in many ways and FINAL as it was expected.<br /><br />Thanks George Lucas for saving the end of skywalker legacy.",1
5579,8.0,"I don't know what movie the negative reviewers saw but the one I saw was pretty great. Wrapped up in a solid way as well as being full of action and true feelings. Even brought back some of the original X-Wing pilots from A New Hope.<br /><br />Overall, pretty great",1
5580,4.0,"No more comment needed as said in my title.<br /><br />The 6 movies before I had the feeling i've seen 10 movies, so many story and action and tense, and off course a lot of effects, and the last 3 were flat, boring, especially the last one is just barely a story, I can make a summary in 3 lines, I even missed the loud sound of the lightsabers as in the previous movies. As I see it, they just want to make more profit and want to have more visitors/ star wars fans in Disneyland, let the 6 others movies be epic, and let it rest.",0
5581,6.0,The final chapter in the sequel trilogy of the Star Wars Saga has arrived. In this review for Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. After witnessing a large decline in popularity since the divisive release of The Last Jedi. Is The Rise of Skywalker strong enough with the force to restore the last of this franchises reputation? Let us begin...,1
5582,8.0,"I want to start this off by saying, J.J. Abrams is a legendary director and I wouldn't choose anyone else for this movie. It was a fantastic movie with fantastic acting and enough twists that you didn't expect anything. J.J. Abrams did extremely well wrapping the series up.",1
5583,7.0,If you overlook a few story issues like new magic force powers<br /><br />Always playing star wars cludo searching for clues<br /><br />Crazy level Emperor powers and more super canon action then it's a major TLJ improvement<br /><br />As always some dazzling effects and great charactors<br /><br />Some lame charactor writing but having snippets of every star wars theme playing was good<br /><br />Films ending was spectacular and again totally sticks the fingers up too Rian Johnson's vision,0
5584,10.0,This finale gave me all the feels.,0
5585,7.0,I enjoyed the film as a fan of the movies. However there are parts that are a let down and soulless. However last jedi it is not so rejoice all you TLJ haters as this movie is better.,1
5586,8.0,"I loved the trilogy. I ve seen many star wars movies but I was never a super fan. I didn't even remember the plot before this one. I only remembered solo because of Harrison Ford. That trilogy was a nice story. Not the best, but nice. From me it's an 8 because to be honest Daisy wasn't very good as Ray and the script could be better. On the other hand, Adam Driver is an amazing actor so its impossible to disappoint you. You should watch and enjoy that movie. And all you nerds who complaining about the story and the production, why don't you write it and shoot it by yourself? (p.s. Thanks Disney)",1
5587,10.0,I don't get all these salty reviews - in my opinion they come from so-called fans that can't be satisfied in any way..<br /><br />Watch the movie!,1
5588,8.0,"Star Wars, as a franchise, has always been the embodiment of the phrase ""a fun time at the cinema with the family"". It has affected generations of moviegoers who have built their imagination courtesy this galaxy, far far away. Right from the opening crawl and John Williams' iconic renditions to the countless number of lightsaber duels and cultural impact through toys and collectibles, this space opera has touched countless lives.",1
5589,8.0,This review contains minor spoilers!,0
5590,10.0,"In my opinion, half the movie's duration i had goosebumps, from the music to the cameos made by the original actors. I really liked this movie",0
5591,9.0,After The Last Jedi I had EXTREMELY low expectations and didn't care to see how it ended but it is Xmas tradition to see Star Wars with the family so we went. After 20 minutes waiting for the shoe to drop I realized this was going to be a great movie. I felt like it tied everything together and was so entertaining. I have only seen the first trilogy as well as Episodes VII and VIII once in the theater and haven't wanted to touch them since. This one though I can't wait to go back to the theater to watch it again. Well done!,1
5592,3.0,"This is, in summary, a bad, fast paced, plothole filled, ACTION ACTION ACTION movie. It moves so fast from scene to scene without letting anything breathe or the viewer absorb what is going on, probably to it's benefit, as all plot points and characters outside of the Rey/Ren conflict are bland. There is only one reason to watch this movie, and that's because you've already seen the others and are in a committed, abusive relationship with Disney",0
5593,9.0,"Gosh, what a hard task redeeming the train-wreck that was the Last Jedi.<br /><br />I went into this thinking it would be trash, having been majorly disappointed with the Last Jedi. But I was truly entertained, like the old star wars movies. The right amount of humour (mostly by the great chemistry between Poe & Finn); fantastic battles and special effects; Many relevant throw backs to the prior films, and decent character development (within the main characters anyway).<br /><br />Sure, some of the parts were rushed, but it is a colossal film to make well.<br /><br />As a star wars fan since the originals, this was exactly what was needed to wrap up the saga.",0
5594,8.0,"This movie is exactly what the fans needed after the disappointing Episode 8. It's what they deseve. This movie teached me to love Rey, Finn and Poe. You finally completely get to accept the new characters and also experience maaany callbacks that will give you goosebumps. It finally united all of the different Star Wars fanbases. A really satisfying ending for an amazing movie franchise! Thank you J.J. Abrams for being such a dedicated fan and a great director.",1
5595,4.0,"I did not grow up with Star Wars, I am only 17 years old. Despite this, this movie still strikes me as a massive nostalgia exploit designed to take money from fans. This movie not only has no stakes, it removes the stakes from older movies. What I mean by this is that this movie has no respect for the events that transpired in the original films. On top of that, every single 'death' in this movie is copped out of in a cheap manner. They could have given some characters some very fulfilling endings that would leave me and all other fans satisfied. Instead, they chose to give us cheap, half-baked endings to some characters and copped out of others. Also, random stuff that has no back story is just thrown into this movie whenever it is seen fit. Rey just can all of a sudden heal people using the force??? Since when? I guess since now since it's convenient for the directors. The Emperor just uses life-steal??? okay? Just cheap, thoughtless writing led to a disappointing plot.",0
5596,9.0,"I'm now 70 and was lucky to have seen SW IV at a preview benefit for the Pacific Film Archives before it was publicly released. Blown away by it and telling everyone I knew that they had to see this movie, I was disappointed when I read the negative reviews of critics in the ensuing months. Fortunately, the vast majority of the public seemed to have liked it and It's now, some 40+ years and 9 movies later.",1
5597,10.0,I consider myself a super fan but I don't pretend that I know what should happen. If I did know and wanted it my way I should have become a screenwriter for Disney!!,1
5598,9.0,"Episode 8 was a mess. I left so disappointed. 9? Good recover. Not a perfect movie but what one is? JJ did a good job tying up the trilogy, I recommend going to see it without an axe to grind.",0
5599,8.0,"The movies was good, but pretty far from perfect. It had good music and fixed many of the problems from the last movie, like the failed humor which they fixed here. The first part of the movie feels a bit rushed but when it gets closer to the ending we get some really good and emotional scenes mixed together with great action",1
5600,5.0,Did not hit the spot with me at all. You can mock the prequels all you want but at least they delivered a good story line. There were some very good points in this movie and some very cheesy ones too. Better than the other two before it but still lacked and real Star Wars feel to it.,1
5601,3.0,"The Rise of Skywalker proves to be film of many disappointments and frustrations. It's plot is full of never-ending dull moments, wasted character potentials and has no scope for something rather intriguing. These are the main outlines of what the film failed to bring out to the audience.",0
5602,7.0,Short and sweet.<br /><br />Think JJ was left with an absolute shit show to clean up after the last jedi.<br /><br />For the most part he manages to tie up majority of lose ends.. definitely has some problems in doing that and the story could be a bit better.<br /><br />But the main thing is I enjoyed it!!<br /><br />far more than the last jedi... at the very least..<br /><br />People forget it will never ever beat the original trilogy but I think does a nice job of adding to it.<br /><br />Dont believe the reviews go watch it yourself.,1
5603,1.0,"I watched it today and I could explain it from start to finish but I won't. I will say it simply: it paid back everything we needed to see. Rey's parents, Leia, Ben Solo, Chewy getting his medal and to top it off, it ends right where it all started; on Tatooine. Overall, it was the best of them all. I didn't overly like the sexual/romantic tension between Rey and Ben but it fits... somehow. I was disappointed Finn didn't confess to Rey about what he was gonna way before they ""drowned"" in the sand. In the end, it ends everything the way it should've. Maybe not how we wanted but hey, what are we gonna do? Demand our money back?",0
5604,9.0,Really wish people would stop whining about these new Star Wars movies.<br /><br />This and the previous 2 were excellent.<br /><br />Ties it all up nicely.,1
5605,3.0,Disappointment with this trilogy. I have seen the original movies since 1977. Who ever wrote the new Skywalker movies never bothered knowing about the details. Example stormtroopers were clones and not recruited from other star systems nor were they kidnapped and forced in to slavery to serve as stormtroopers. No words of wisdoms how to use and learn about the force. Yes the force was used but not in an impressive way.,0
5606,8.0,"I really enjoyed this movie, I must say that it tied all the pieces together nicely.",1
5607,8.0,"I entered the cinema with an open mind. I understood what had happened with the previous film and new that JJ would have to both fix and build upon what was left for him.<br /><br />I didn't expect anything fantastic, and yet I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. The Rise of Skywalker wraps up this trilogy in what I honestly thought was the best way possible. Those who have hated it, have not hated this one film, but the trilogy as a whole. But my rating and review is solely based on this film itself...<br /><br />Go, watch the film and formulate your opinion for yourself, don't let anyone make it for you",1
5608,2.0,"There are few action sequences that look and feel good in this movie. The rest is 1 dimensional, fan service trash with no soul.",1
5609,8.0,"Went to see this movie with mixed feelings .<br /><br />I remember watching The Star Wars when it came out , so this conclusion was highly anticipated , but after all the bad reviews I wasn't hoping for much.<br /><br />Don't believe the bad reviews.<br /><br />Ok , the film isn't an Oscar winner , but , it's not bad at all.<br /><br />Little bit all over the place for the first bit , but it's all explained intelligently and the movie ties up a lot of loose ends<br /><br />I'd recommend watching it , if you are a genuine Star Wars fan , it certainly knocks spots off the last dismal entry in the story.",0
5610,6.0,"So that's the end?.. The Star Wars ending didn't dry up in cement it became a slippery slope of ice. The marketing for this movie was brilliant while the ending was a complete collapse of ultimate dry chaos. The plot, subplot, climax and everything that makes Star Wars films great was just created with crayon on a kids menu. This movie stung alot.",1
5611,1.0,"This entire trilogy was so bad that words can't describe how they have destroy star wars with their wokeness. Everything about this movie is bad. The dialogue its terrible, their interactions are so stupid, I mean honestly they thought this movie was gonna be a legend? IT SUCKS!",0
5612,9.0,"I think people who watched this movie will either love it or hate it so much. I came to watch without any expectation after went through the comment section. I'm glad that I decided to watch it today and I personally think this movie has a lot to offer in terms of action and emotion. It's not the best out of the 9 movies, but certainly not the worst. The fault is not in this movie, it's in the previous one.",1
5613,,First part of Star Wars which i dont prefer.<br /><br />So boring. Just effects is ok. I never believe - i dont like this movie....<br /><br />Original trilogy will be always in History. This part i dont think so...,0
5614,8.0,"The film is a 7.5. Some of the 1 and 2 star reviews are over reactive nonsense. It's not a bad film. If you can get past the pointless death of Leia, a story line that undermines luke and anakins character archs and a whimsical decision to kill kylo ren for the sake of it, then the film is very enjoyable. Its well paced with plenty of fan service (if you don't like fan service, get over yourself). There are some truely heart warming moments in the film like Luke grabbing the light saber.",1
5615,6.0,"Don't listen to the criticism. I went in thinking the worst not really wanting to enjoy it just to see it in the big screen. We used gift cards to see it so we didn't pay much. The movie isn't half bad! I was very surprised. The music was right on par. Everything was better than VIII. Finn did more than nothing! He was the glue and positive energy that kept the crew together while Rey just kept going off on her own. After seeing IX explains why the First Order was taking their time 'finishing' the rebels off in IX (which originally turned me off on VIII). The movie goes FAST. Made for people with ADHD? Maybe but we may just need all the deleted scenes back in. The movie wasn't bad and the end did get a bit sentimental, but it could have taken it's time a little bit for us to breathe. It does make sense. Thankfully I had to get up to use the restroom and missed the whole ""they fly now?"" Bit. Could have done without seeing 2 girls kiss at the end... why!??? Other than that ONE complaint it was not a bad movie for THIS chapter of this alternative saga created by Disney and wraps everything up rather well. Plenty of neat cameos too. Again I'd watch it again with the extra scenes added in. Give us that 3 hour movie y'all were touting. Worth a few extra viewings actually compared to the ONE viewing of VIII.",0
5616,2.0,"One of the worst movies in the franchise. Where to begin, Riddley's acting? JJ Abrams directing? The flat delivery of countless poorly timed jokes? Ren's helmet? Yellow Lightsaber? Walking around on a Star Destroyer IN* space, with gravity along with breathable air? Bens weird faint death?",0
5617,1.0,Do you any jedi? Do you know any actual practitioners of the force??<br /><br />I need help. I need your help. I need a Jedi to perform a mind trick on me and make me completely forget the Disney trilogy.,1

5619,1.0,What an absolute mess. Hang your head in shame Abrahams. An abomination of an end to one of the all time great movie franchises. But hey its all about the dollar signs eh.,0
5620,8.0,"I'm a last Jedi fan, actually a massive fan, I really thought it was brilliant, original and creative. So, it's a bit of a bummer in my opinion that most of it was retconned, sure I wasn't a massive Rose Tico fan but she is given the Jar Jar treatment in this movie, no mention of her love interest with Finn. Suddenly the emperor is back, suddenly Rey goes from someone to noone to being the grandaughter of Palps, I was a fan of her being a nobody, just a random Jedi, but yeah they kinda crapped on everything from The Last Jedi. Ok, I guess maybe that'll make a lot of people happy but to me it makes it feel incohesive as a trilogy and rather weird to me. Anyway with that out of the way there was a still a lot of good about this movie, obvs sets, chi, that was all great. But like most will say the dynamic between Rey and Kylo is soooo good still, I'm glad they kept the force Skype thing from the last Jedi, and it got even stronger. The lightsaber duels between the 2 are freaking sweet and Palps looks pretty good even though it seems a bit forced Leia was handled really well, her death was a really clever idea and it oddly worked with the old footage. So some good and some bad and a lot of inbetween. However I'm sure in 20 years these will be as revered as the prequels are now.",1

5623,7.0,You could realise the original star wars and people would be on here saying they are true fans in they are terrible.,0
5624,4.0,The Rise of Skywalker is fast paced but in going so fast it had a ton of plot holes in it. Not the worst 2 hours of my life but I did leave the movie theatre feeling a little let down especially as there is no fixing what this movie has done to the series.,0
5625,9.0,There are some problems about the movie but it's a great ending for a great journey,1
5626,10.0,The movie has a perfect ending for the Saga. It brings memories that will make enjoy to all fans and have some epic moments too,1
5627,10.0,"I know a lot of people are disappointed by this film but I'm one of the people who weren't. This film was satisfying to me, after the disaster of The Last Jedi I was worried about this movie but J.J Abrams managed to pull it off and create an epic instalment of the franchise and fix mistakes from The Last Jedi. There was a lot of fan service but I didn't mind that, Avengers: Endgame had lot of fan service and it seems like nobody was complaining about that, I don't fully understand why there's so much hate for the fan service in this. However, I understand that people would like to shocked and surprised by moments in the film instead of getting everything you wanted and more. I think there were surprising moments in Rise Of Skywalker but it was balanced with the fan service. I think this film should get more credit and also more love, but that's my opinion - it has moments that fans wanted but also brings in moments that fans never saw coming. Plus, J.J did the best he could after what Rian did with Last Jedi. Overall, I'm happy with this film and I hope it brought a satisfying conclusion to you and others.",1
5628,8.0,"I really didn't know how the final chapter of the Skywalker saga was going to pan out. With J.J. Abrams back at the helm, I was holding out some hope that he'd restore some of magic and nostalgia he's known for.",1
5629,7.0,Slightly disappointed to be honest.<br /><br />With the amount of trailers that I watched and TV spots that I came across and the return of Emperor palpitatine... I thought this would've been the one.<br /><br />... And expected at least a light sabre duel at the end in the final act of the film.<br /><br />But there were some very very good moments.<br /><br />PS ~ kylo Ren is the greatest thing to come from the sequel trilogy.,1
5630,5.0,"All and all it was an enjoyable movie unlike the boring anger inducing episode 8. Episode 9 would have been better had it not been in a rush trying to fix the errors of the last jedi, but I felt jj did the best he could with what he was handed. My only gripe is the ending could have been a little better. If it was 3 hours, that would have fixed the rushed feeling.",1
5631,6.0,"Yes, I genuinely hated The Last Jedi. Why? Because if you're a long time Star Wars fan you go to see these movies in the SKYWALKER SAGA to focus on everything Skywalker and to get that nostalgic feeling that TFA presented. If you wanted an original Star Wars movie. Don't follow up on Return Of The Jedi. I liked this movie. It's full of memberberry's and A LOT of damage control. It fixed so much Rian Johnson killed. It's a little too much at times but I can't blame JJ. If you have to fix this mess and finish the complete trilogy in a little over two hours....He did a great job. Of course the other half is going to hate now. And I get that. I'm glad we can finally move on to new Star Wars movies that hopefully don't dishonor the lore.",1
5632,8.0,"At last... the best Episode among the sequel trilogy. I was so disappointed by the outcome of the force awakens and the last jedi, I find it very very Disney movie. But for The Rise of Skywalker, it gives a lot of surprises that every Star Wars fan is asking for.",1
5633,9.0,"I loved it. It's everything a Star Wars movie should be. After the mess that was The Last Jedi, I wondered how J.J. Abrams was going to save it. But he definitely did. He managed to make Episode XIII look better too. It's a thoroughly enjoyable movie, if you sit back and enjoy the ride. All this miserable nit picking is ridiculous! The biggest complaint seems to be that there was too much 'fan service'. Why on earth would pleasing the fans be a bad thing?! If you're looking for an Oscar worthy movie, go watch Joker or something. This is Star Wars! And quite possibly the best one.",0

The story people say was messy but honestly was pretty easy to follow and only had two stories going at the same time like most movies!",1
5638,8.0,"I loved force awakens, and was pretty impartial to the last Jedi. This movie for me, is the most watchable movie of this trilogy. There's lots of action, the film is very fast paced and constantly engaging. The plot did seem thin at times, almost like a video game style plot, but the character payoffs and explanations I thought were great and highly satisfying. My complaints are mainly to do with palpatine who is one of my favourite villains of all time. An explanation for his survival is not at all given, and I think his place in this trilogy is not very well justified. That being said his presence in the movie was huge and it was great seeing the big bad of the Star Wars at the end of the saga. I think the main problems with the movie are in the first 40 mins or so, where scenes just wiz by, and there's so much explained it almost feels like this should've have been a 3 hour movie, and honestly for the 9th film in the saga I think this sort of runtime would be warranted. Although there are flaws this is most likely the film from this trilogy I will watch most. I like this movie for the same reason I liked Revenge of the Sith. The constant action is great while still having the necessary character moments to end this trilogy.",1
5639,1.0,"This is a really bad movie, infested with j3w1sh propaganda as per usual, and a very very bad story that only played on nostalgia. Last scene of the movie with Rey and her blue hair was so inspiring for all the strong independent womyn.",0
5640,8.0,First let's give credit to J.J. Abrams. ( Next paragraph is the movie review),0
5641,,This movie was boring from the start till the end. It does not have the perfect taste offered by the previous films of the trilogy. And I'd ratsher not have Palpatine at the end.,0
5642,10.0,"A TRUE star wars fan will love the final instalment, it ends where it all began,",1
5643,5.0,"Before I say anything, the reason I gave it five out of ten is because I loved it, but, I also see why the critics gave the movie not so stellar reviews. The reason why I love Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is because it was different. I wasn't expecting the film to be about the resistance trying to flee from the First Order, and that it absolutely looked like there was no hope at all for them, and that there was a completely insane plan only made by a few resistance members so they can successfully flee from them. Usually, you expect for the commanders to go along with this ridiculous plan, but they didn't agree with the plan, and that they had they're own plan, which the few resistance plan screwed up due to a code breaker snitching on them, which is also completely unexpected. To get to the point, people hated The Last Jedi because the majority of people do not like things that are different, thus, the amazing reviews which I side with by the way. Now this all sets up my review for Rise Of Skywalker. Because the majority of ""True Star Wars Fans"" hated The Last Jedi, they gave way to much feedback to J.J. Abrams for how this film goes. Don't get me wrong, fan service for films can be really great. But, at times, that can also be really bad for films as well. Some things worked really well for me in the film, like how Palpatine explains that Snoke is essentially a very deformed clone of him. That works. And it gives more backstory on Rey's Parents and that they pretended to be nobodies in order to protect Rey because she is Palpatine's Granddaughter. That works as well. However, making the film jump a year after the events of The Last Jedi and the Final Order, which I felt was a plot device, didn't work with me at all. The final battle was really cool, do not think that I don't think it is, but I saw it as a plot device. ""The First Order has become The Final Order and the Galaxy must unite, even though it looks like there is no hope, to stop them from truly taking over again"". Please understand that I thought the movie was great, and that given that this is the last film in the Skywalker Saga, the Director, crew, and cast had very limited resources to work with. And, if the ""True Star Wars Fans"" didn't essentially trash The Last Jedi, then maybe we could have gotten a final Star Wars Skywalker Saga Film we all could have gotten we could all enjoy. But no, we cannot. I thought this movie was really good, but they shouldn't have listened to the negative reviews for The Last Jedi. That's my biggest gripe. I am sorry for being really honest.",1
5644,8.0,"This movie is by no means perfect, and it walks back or completely ignores several plot threads established in Episode 8. This results in a movie that tries to pack in a LOT of story in a limited package, and it can feel a bit rushed.",1

5648,8.0,"Had NO problem with the story line. Enjoyed it very much. I think the only thing missing was HOW Palpatine survived, would have liked an explanation",0
5649,9.0,"While this movie may not have been the ideal movie that everyone had in their head I just want to say that J.J. Abrams, the cast, and everyone who worked on this movie did an excellent job. Disney actually listened to the concerns of fans this time and gave us an original Star Wars movie. I won't give any spoilers but all I'll say is that the heroes in this movie were absolutely in their final hour and when all hope seemed lost, everyone from all over the galaxy will unite and stand with the Resistance in their final battle against Emperor Palpatine and the remnants of the Empire. The person who really stole this show though was Billy Dee Williams who came back as Lando Calrissian and even though he had only 2 or 5 scenes in the movie overall he just completely stood out and helped to make this movie truly feel like Star Wars.",1

5651,8.0,"I was quite shocked when I see this Star Wars entry got bad reviews everywhere (58% on Rotten Tomatoes!). I decided to lower my expectations before I see this film, although I'm still a bit optimistic that this film will entertain me and finishing The Skywalker Saga nicely. When I finally walked out from the theater, my feelings are really, really mixed. This film really has some problems as everyone says. Uneven pacing at some parts, forced twists (Rey's linage), and some characters handling are unsatisfactory (especially for Ben Solo :""). But at some parts, I was fairly enjoyed by this film. The action and visuals are breathtaking, John Williams's score still awesome as ever, some appearance of the old faces makes me nostalgic af, and finally, we can see the main trio of this sequel trilogy (Rey - Finn - Poe) interacting together. A problematic, yet, at some parts, a quite fitting conclusions of The Skywalker Saga.",1
5652,10.0,"I grew up with the originals, so I am very emotionally invested into this storyline. I was not a huge fan of episode seven, and I out right hated episode eight with a passion. Rian Johnson almost destroyed the franchise, but JJ Abrams just saved it.",1
5653,2.0,Where do I begin with this movie...<br /><br />OK. lets start with the things that I liked: zombie palpatine looked pretty cool and the death star ruins were pretty cool.,0
5654,8.0,"The plot is nonsensical, so turn your brain off. It's abundantly clear that across all the three new movies there was no planned out overall story arc; so lots of retconning required. As with Ep 7 and 8, this movie has a very convoluted McGuffin(s).",0
5655,10.0,"Action packed, emotional, and exciting ending to this saga. Sad to see it ending!",1

I agree with the movie's blistering pace, the plot holes or the apparently crazy things you can do with the force now. But I give my 10/10 rating because of the way I felt leaving the theater.",0
5657,4.0,"It's quite a poor film but better than The Last Jedi, not like that was going to be hard, I'm not sure what George Lucas had planned for this trilogy but it must have been better than the actual trilogy turned out, it's all felt wrong, very little Star Wars feel to them all, they've even made the prequel trilogy better.<br /><br />Disney, the story (if there was any) and the direction of the films are all wrong, Disney started off really well with the excellent Rogue On, the good Force Awakens then went downhill fast.<br /><br />Please Disney don't make anymore, just leave us with good memories",0
5658,10.0,But I loved it good has to beat evil every time. At the end when he gave her his life and went home to his family it well fitting. I know people will think she don't know what she talking about and thAt ok but personally I loved it,1
5659,5.0,"The story is a rushed, point A to point B nothing in between with some plot hole-causing fanservice thrown in and a villain that literally just shows up out of nowhere. Some of the writing is cringeworthy. It's almost entirely focused on Rey, Poe and Kylo with everything else falling extremely flat. On the good side, it's got all the usual Star Wars awesomeness like epic space battles, plenty of saber fights etc plus some good character development for the 3 it does spend all its time on, but that and the um...very distracting Daisy Ridley don't make it a good movie. Regardless, I'd still watch it if you're a Star Wars fan. The ending especially has some pretty impressive visual sequences. Despite the issues I still managed to enjoy it.",0

5661,10.0,"It can be said as simple as that: It is the best Star Wars movie ever made!!!<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. There a few moments where the movie ""slowed down"" and I could lean back. But no more than a minute at the time and not many of those.<br /><br />The Skywalker saga got the kind of movie it deserved to finish it off.",1
5662,10.0,The final installment of the Skywalker saga definitely delivered. Don't listen to the negative reviews it was a completely entertaining film and for the hardcore fans it's an emotional ending to something that been a part of my life since I was 3. The saga may end but Star Wars will love forever!,1
5663,7.0,"Starts off promisingly but then tails off... not much character evolution and dialogue between cast is painful at times... does tie up some loose ends and is better than The Last Jedi... but it could have been so much better, The twists can be seen before they happen...felt rushed! I hate Disney!",0
5664,6.0,"Being the third and last movie of the sequels, nothing new here at all. in fact i thought it was less entertaining than the previous 2, at times the camera work is all over the place with 5 cuts a second and its just hard to follow what is even happening, alot of the scenes which should have emotional value are just really forced and cheesy, in contrast the story-line is a mess and everything important is rushed and fails to grab your attention, overall nothing surprising happens...",0
5665,7.0,"Seem to forget how bad the prequels were, and the reason they were so bad - because people took ""Star Wars"" WAY, WAY too seriously...",0
5666,8.0,"I was nervous going into this movie, afraid of the direction Disney would take it. At the beginning of the film, they shoved in a lot of plot points to try to set up the story. Then, while the stakes were mentioned early on, the stakes were not felt by the audience. The second half of the film allows us to start feeling those stakes. It also does a good job bringing the Saga to a close.",0
5667,,Never mind the critics. #StarWars9 is a fun and fitting end to the saga. Family ties explained and story lines connected in a visual extravaganza that made time pass quickly. The life force victorious. Nice job @jjabrams.,1
5668,7.0,"While the movie doesn't reinvent the ""Star Wars"" wheel, the action is great, the fan service is fun and tugs at the right strings, and the effects are top-notch. Solid end to the Skywalker saga of films.",1
5669,8.0,"Honestly, this movie could've been so much more. They could've split it into two and remove the previous abomination movie from cannon. Feels like star wars again and it's my favourite from the last trilogy. Space combat, ground combat and Force combat all together as a good star wars style. It was a enjoyable movie, too bad last one shattered everything.",0
5670,10.0,"Still trying to find the perfect words to describe this jewel. The feelings were overwhelming. I was in the release, and since minute one all people in the theatre were absolutely connected to the story and the characters. Everybody of us were in tension, ready to acclaim every single wonderful surprise, every tender moment. We were ALL connected, I never have felt this before in any movie. We cheered Luke and Han. We cheered the appearance of Lando with all the ships. We cheered Hux helping the Resistance. We cheered Ben Solo fighting against his own Ren Knights. And , when Ben saved Rey from death, when both looked at each other with that sweet, sweet complicity, and then they kissed, the theater was flooded with love and longing.<br /><br />Never have experienced this before. Never in my life. Not with cinema classics, not with academy awards masterpieces such as Titanic or Gladiator. Not with romantic dramas.<br /><br />This must be magic.<br /><br />And The Rise of Skywalker has become my favorite movie in all my life.<br /><br />Thank you J.J. Thank you Star Wars. Thanks with all my heart. Nothing will erase these moments , these feelings.",1
5671,8.0,"Overall it's a good movie. Definitely theater worthy. Fun, action packed and wraps up the saga well. There are some Youtube reviews where it looks like people are ripping the movie apart just to feed the haters and get the views. One guy was complaining about things that are very much within the boundaries of the Star Wars universe. ""Why doesn't Palpatine just make more Sith? It's mind blowing how stupid this is."" - Um because there can be only 2. Never more. Never less. #clickbait",1
5672,10.0,Don't believe the picky people who wanted it a different way.<br /><br />Just enjoy the fact that we have more Star Wars movies!!,1
5673,7.0,"Given the polarising nature of Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi', coupled with the underwhelming performance of 'Solo', it seems as though Disney felt the need to play things safe for the third and final instalment in the sequel trilogy. And so, given the overwhelming commercial success of 'The Force Awakens', they opted to invite J.J. Abrams back to end the trilogy with a home-run. They partly succeeded, and I'm sure that many of the fans who rejected the subversive nature of 'The Last Jedi' will enjoy this film and its efforts to appease them. And yet, while this fan-servicing approach is arguably the film's greatest strength, so too is it its greatest weakness.",1
5674,7.0,"So JJ Abrams decided that fan service was more important than story, narrative, character development and plot. I am a MASSIVE Star Wars fan and have been since the start (I'm old). I usually get goosebumps and get overly emotional during Star Wars movies, but I didn't really feel much of anything during this. It feels like the jawas, ewoks, porgs and Han Solo were just shoehorned in without any narrative thought. I love the storytelling in the Star Wars universe, but it's like JJ Abrams just shouted, ""Palpatine is alive, because....cloning!"" and then shat on my dreams.",1

5679,9.0,"After reading a few reviews, I felt compelled to create an account to just write this.",0
5680,5.0,"I went into this one with lower expectations, yet I came out with such a terrible feeling. This film really disrespected my personal favourite in the saga, Return Of The Jedi as the choice to put The Emperor was not justified at all and makes his death scene in Ep 6 less powerful as I know he will be back in Ep 9. Also it disrespects TLJ with certain retcons to what Rian Johnson wanted, and I personally enjoyed TLJ. The film was overall not very entertaining either, as were essentially watching characters take part in a video game plot of going here to do this etc. The characters were also wasted, and the film even felt rushed which is surprising for a 2 year wait, and the ending was so awful. I am gald it is over now, and have decided to treat the sequel trilogy as non canon due to this waste, because clearly there was no overall plan for this trilogy unlike the prequels which at least had a direction to go in.",0
5681,4.0,"Thought the story lost the plot in the first of this trio. Disney lost the plot literally, the so called shock was somewhat obvious but most disturbing was the acting in this one not being believable. It was such a shame to throw a franchise, here's hoping they have another go.",0

5685,6.0,What I was most afraid of going into RoS:,0
5686,2.0,"The story is typical of Disney movies and reminds me a bit of Maleficient. The plot was rarely exciting, so it was mostly boring. In total, the film should earn a maximum of 3/10 and a second time I will not watch it.",0

5688,1.0,"J.J. Abrams definitely should pursue another career!!!!!! This is the worst Star Wars movie EVER! I cannot believe I wasted time and money watch this. If imdb had a 0 rate option, I would have chosen this.",0
5689,10.0,"I've been a Star Wars fan for most of my life and was waiting anxiously the past few months for it. I have read many of the negative reviews and don't understand how people give it 1, 2 stars. Below I'm going to illustrate examples why I think it's great, so -SPOILERS, be warned!<br /><br />1. The explanation of the rise of Snoke - many complained after Episode 8 that it didn't explain that, well we get it in here.<br /><br />2. The story of Ben/Kylo - before it did seem kinda strange, but now, seeing the truth of Palpatine's work in the shadows it makes sense. Ben was always being twisted from afar by Palpatine, much like Anakin.<br /><br />3. Rey's power. What many complained about in the other two movies was Rey's unexplainable power in the Force, but after the revelation of her true lineage it makes perfect sense. For those who don't think so, I suggest you read James Luceno's Darth Plagueis. ""Legends"" or not, it shows that Palpatine's raw power in so great that his bursts of anger as a teenager affect nature itself. It is no wonder Rey is so strong being his granddaughter.<br /><br />I could go on and on about it but it would take too long.",1

I've had my problems w other of the movies but not this one. Anything that tries to wrap up 40 years of film in 2.5 hours is going to not please everyone but it nailed it for me. The callbacks were there and didn't feel hokey or forced. Easter eggs were present but not in your face. And if you're worried about plot holes in a movie about space smugglers and mystic knights, I think you're missing the point. I feel satisfied in a way I wasn't after GoT but it's up there w Empire.

No Star Wars movie has ever made me feel so horrible. I will never watch this film again.,0
5696,3.0,"Maybe I was expecting too much but I was let down. I love the star wars franchise and to see it end like this is sad. Now just looking at this movie it was messy, inconsistent and seemed rushed. The contents of this movie could have been a pair of movies. The special effects were good and cinematography was okay, from a visual stand point it's not a bad movie but from its contents is terrible. I didn't enjoy episode 8 which set episode 9 up for failure and in my eyes it did fail. As far as I'm concerned the saga ended at 6.",0
5697,10.0,I dont know why everyone shout on JJ. This film was great.I think it is the best star wars i've ever seen. But there is some problem about speed of story tale in the movie. That was so fast. It is not JJ fault. He need to finish 40 years of story in 2 hours. The finishing was absolutely right.All arcs has ENDED. Sky walker saga ending was the best as possible.Don't listen to critics they are not fan.Go see the film. ENJOY it and come back to vote right. I love this film and STARWARS for ever.sorry for my grammetical mistake.,1
5698,10.0,It's a beautiful closure to the saga. It's a fantastic tribute to the original Star Wars trilogy.... Lucas should be proud of how the story has been treated and made. I started following the Starwars saga 25 years back...and in retrospect I think that it's commendable that the makers of the last trilogy managed to do wonderful job of taking the saga to its conclusion. Infact...it closes the loop brilliantly. The essence of Starwars from Lucas's original vision to the next 3 ( much better stories) to the last 3 from JJ Abrams... imho he is the new Lucas. The real fans will truly appreciate and love this last installment. It's amazing how such stories and characters and even actors can manage to enthrall us across 4 decades!! Wel done JJ Abrams!!!,1

There were too many previous story threads left loose, with multiple new storylines added, that seemed kind of pointless.

The movies are pure escapism that speak about one topic HOPE!! Belief that against insurmountable odds you can succeed. I don't listen to fanboy nonsense (they have too much time on their hands and over anylise) they forget what the core of these movies are about, plain fun and that little buzz and goose pimple feeling you have when watching these kind of movies.

I was ok with The force awakens. I was not fully satisfied, but the introduction of Luke at the end gave me hopes for The last jedi.

I do think that JJ Abrams could have done better with introducing that Rey is Palpatine's granddaughter, I think he should have made that more of a story throughout his part of the trilogy. If this is supposed to be the last of the Skywalker trilogy, I think that JJ Abrams failed at that part. The ending makes me think that there will be more to the Skywalker storyline. There are too many loose ends and makes the movie a little confusing. I did think that it was cool keeping Leia alive in this with Carrie Fisher gone. I would recommend seeing it.",0

I have been a fan of the Star Wars saga seen first seeing A New Hope in January 1978 at Holloway Odeon (North London).This film was a definitely an improvement on TLJ and it made me both laugh (C3PO comments) and cry (Luke, Leia and Han scenes). I don't understand the criticism of this film, it has excellent battle scenes and the acting was good (particularly Daisy Ridley and Adam Driiver). I especially loved the nods to the previous films including the different Saga planets at the end of the film (Bespin, Endor and Tantooine). Thanks JJ and the cast and crew for providing a highly enjoyable conclusion to the Skywalker Saga and for this 48 year old to come full circle with his love of this saga. May the force be with you.... always.",1

5711,5.0,"Anyone that knows me knows that I'm a Star Wars apologist and have been since the prequels.<br /><br />I went to a trilogy screening last night and have loved the Christmas's of the past few years when TFA and TLJ were released. I've loved Star Wars for all but 8 years of my life and couldn't wait for this one. I've skimmed through the leaks without really caring as, to me, a lot of it is for YouTube clicks bit I was really amped up for ROS.<br /><br />So it came to watching it at 12:05 this morning.<br /><br />The problem for me stems from Disney/Lucasfilm/Kathleen Kennedy/J.J. Abrams not having a plan for this trilogy from the start. The Marvel way if you like. It's no coincidence that a series of films that has been planned for over a decade ended with, for me, the gloriously satisfying Avengers : Endgame. There was a plan. For this trilogy there was not. I love TFA so for all that J.J. set up Rian Johnson then destroyed in TLJ. ""Let it die"" as he said. So now ROS has to rebuild and answer all that was set up in TFA. The problem is the movie doesn't answer all the questions. Now I believe maybe it shouldn't. Life doesn't tie everything up in neat little bows.<br /><br />My main problem with ROS I felt when coming out of the screening was that I couldn't remember one set piece that took my breath away. There were a couple of moments where there were tears in my eyes (Star Wars gets me like that) but not to the extent of ""Chewie we're home"" or seeing the Falcon for the first time. When all the ships of the resistance turned up at the finale lead by Lando you could see they were going for the ""On your left"" moment in the movie but it emotionally just didn't land.<br /><br />The convoluted process lot of we need to go here to get this so we can go there and get that seemed formulaic and now there is the power of bringing people back to life the phrase ""no one is ever really gone"" takes a depressing meaning.<br /><br />With Palpatine back Anakins redemption in ROTJ means less now. There is no explanation how he didn't die. Fun spends most of the movie wanting to tell Rey something then never gets the chance.<br /><br />Rey and Ben kiss after Bens redemption and it just didn't feel right.<br /><br />I don't think I can go through anymore as I feel pretty empty now. I'm going to see it again in a few hours and I'm hoping a repeat viewing will change my views but at the mo I am pretty empty inside.<br /><br />The Force will always be with me and let's see what the future of Star Wars is. Maybe it's on the small screen for now. The Mandalorian rocks!",1

The WAY less experienced users of the force make anything Yoda ever did look like a joke. And Palpatine returns, evil as ever, powerfull as ever. In this movie he is portraid like the devil himself, with powers way beyond what he ever had originally.",0

5714,5.0,I grew up with Star Wars.,0
5715,7.0,I almost didn't go see this movie based on what I was hearing. I like the general idea of the plot given the circumstances. JJ had his work cut out for him based on that last atrocity. A lot of the dialogue felt rushed like they were trying to hurry through the movie. People were talking over each other and a lot of exposition. There were way to many convenient moments in this movie. I lost count of how many 30 year old ships were just laying around......unlocked.......with the keys still in the ignition. It seems like only the good guys are the ones who steal in this universe. The same could be said for all the random armies they had just laying around just so they could have a space battle. All in all not to bad though. Worth a watch.,0
5716,7.0,It's a Star Wars movie! Plenty of suspension of disbelief. Follows the Star Wars story and has lots of series cameos. Good flick. Most people will really enjoy it. Personally my favorite of any of the Star Wars movies in the past few decades is Rogue One. Good as a stand-alone movie and adds to the Star Wars series even as an off-shoot.,1
5717,9.0,"Before going to the movie I did stumble onto the reviews to see what I would expect as The Last Jedi I went into with high expectations and left upset. Went into this movie with low expectations and wasn't disappointed. The low ratings I can see most of their reasoning. However, if I could I would give this film a solid 8.5. What made this film much better than the previous two was the action. Yes the dark side was a little pushed but of course due to the limited time of the movie need to kick start from the beginning. I thought The Rise Of Skywalker was brilliant and it ended this trilogy nicely. Now that's not saying it didn't end the entire 9 perfectly but for the newly Star Wars it was action packed, emotional for those long time fans, and had those moments when you wanted to fist pump! Go see it. Expect greatness.",1
5718,9.0,I was worried because of the early negative critic reviews but I really liked the movie and plan on seeing it again this weekend. I think it was the best of the final trilogy.,1
5719,8.0,"As a Star Wars fan, I will never say things like ""that's a bad movie"" and I will never rate any Star Wars work under 8. I'm never a big fan of JJ Abrams, because of Lost. But, comparing with episode 8, this one is much better in the plot. I believe this credit belongs to JJ. Yes, it's full of cliche and genre writing, and before we enter the cinema, we have already known this will be happey ending, but come on, if this is not happy ending, we will light up Disney.<br /><br />That being said, the worst thing of this movie is the mentality ""when in doube, the force"". Whenever this movie needs to explaine how something miraculous happened, the go to answer is ""that's the force"". That's not how the force works!",0
5720,10.0,"I'm 41 now, I've been obsessed with Star Wars since I saw Empire strikes back when I was 2 years old at the cinema. Rise of skywalker just simply blew me away. I cannot even put into words how amazing it was for me, I went through so many emotions watching it like I haven't done with any other SW film before. I laughed and I cried quite a few times. It was a roller coaster ride. I feel like the new characters really gelled in this one, more than episode 7 and 8. JJ really nailed this one for me. Its a shame that the trilogy now ends just as it got as good as the originals. In some way it was better than the originals but maybe that's just because it was so emotional and I probably had a lot of nostalgia. But it really was so fun. Ask me in 40 years though after watching it 400 times if it's as good as the original trilogy because right now I've only seen it once :)<br /><br />Thank you to Disney for making my dreams come true and making this new trilogy. I do wish it had been done 20 years ago with Han Leia and Luke together in their prime, but they didn't, so this to me is as good as it could get in 2019 without those 3 characters together leading the roles, they're like family to me those 3.<br /><br />C3PO was back to his best in this. I did feel the last two lacked so much 3PO.",1
5721,8.0,"Rise of Skywalker is a great conclusion to this great franchise. It does not deserve more than an 8, only the originals are 8s. Overall the whole movie was filled with nostalgia and small things from the past. JJ abrams did the best he could to recover from the last Jedi, and in the end he satisfied us all. There were surprises all throughout the movie. Loved it!!!",1
5722,2.0,"After I saw it in cinema, I was very disappointed, nothing made sense.<br /><br />How is Palpatine back ? if he was the ultimate baddy, why did he send a broadcast? he could have done a surprise attack without telling, as he was hiding for so long...and why give 16 hours notice? doesn't make sense...<br /><br />Chewie exploding mid-air...and no ! He's alive.! I guess he must've taken another transport...that's very convenient, even Poe seems surprised !<br /><br />The dagger and the way finder...what are the possibilities of being at this exact spot? Wayfinder wasn't hard to find really bit of climbing, enter the throne room and voila ! the door opens.....and also, I thought the death star exploded in billions of particles (i.e. return of the jedi...) ? How a big chunk was magically preserved on this unknown 9useless) planet? And the force heal...why some amazing jedi master never used it before this ""nobody scavenger"" ? How ? so many holes...I could go on...",0
5723,2.0,It's a fine Star Wars film just fine. Too flashy and not great but wraps up the already very messy new saga.,1
5724,2.0,"Disney has seriously damaged this brand. The original Star Wars always had problems that you could overlook because of its many entertaining and meaningful moments. The prequels and this trilogy are both horrendously bad. However, unlike The Last Jedi in which the director Rian Johnson was deliberately trying to run the series into the ground, there seemed to be an honest attempt to make a good movie here. Despite the numerous plot holes, logical inconsistencies, and one dimensional characters there was an effort to provide some sort of entertaining closure.<br /><br />This trilogy, and this movie in particular, is not the original and had no chance to be anywhere as good. However, even with low expectations this movie is poor. One simple thing that would have improved this movie would be to give some indication of what a Jedi or Sith's powers are. On a scale of average person or average species to Superman about where is this character now? There seems to be so much power inflation (what power level is Rey at compared to Jedi from the original trilogy?).<br /><br />Ultimately this is a poor movie. There have been NO good Star Wars movies since the original trilogy, with the exception of Rogue One. Obviously Star Wars is just a cash cow for Disney. Still, it will be interesting to see where they go with the franchise from here.",0

The scenes had me on the edge of my seat, or welling you with tears. The camera was a bit shaky at points, but overall it was a great film, and totally deserves a 10/10! I've been watching Star Wars films since I was born, and I know what a Star Wars film should be, and this has all the makings of a perfect ending.",1

Get over it fanboys, this is now canon. The fan service was good (not overwhelming, like most critics say) and when it comes to who the last Skywalker is, reminisce on the final scene between Ben and Rey...... I have spoken and this is the way. And may the Force be with you.",1
5729,2.0,"I take no pleasure in writing this. But the filmmakers should know why I also took no pleasure in experiencing this utter catastrophe of a film. I've been watching SW movies since I first caught Empire on TV when I was 5 in 1983. It blew my little mind. That being said, I'm no fanboy; I give credit where credit is due, but I look at movies with a critical eye. I'm also a film school graduate, but I'm not interested in pretending to know more than others, I'm just not a novice/casual movie goer. I am happy if people enjoy things that are flawed, even if it's not my cup of tea. That being said, Star Wars is my cup of tea, but some of the films are highly flawed and a bit disappointing. The Rise of Skywalker was more than a bit disappointing, and I'm left with even less respect for this than I have for the prequels, which at least attempted to tell a story.",0
5730,9.0,"I love star wars. Always have always will. I was terrified I wouldn't like this after hating tlj but thankfully J.J saved the day. It starts out at breakneck speed and I was worried it would run out of steam halfway through but again J.J nailed it. I think wisely the opening scroll shaved off about an hours worth of storytelling. I won't spoil it but it does. It's a little hard to swallow at first but given how off the rails tlj took the narrative I think it was an attempt to undo the damage without losing to much screen time, it won't be to everyone's taste I'm sure but it worked for me. At first I was unsure how this movie was going to play out it seemed to be lacking that star wars atmosphere but again I think that was just cramming in a lot of setup in the first twenty minutes or so. Most likely because Rian Johnston's movie left so little to work with. Once the domino's were set up I found it thrilling and utterly enjoyable. There was a nice little moment fairly early into it involving Chewbacca that totally fooled me into almost storming out. I thought it was more of the same disrespect for beloved characters the previous entry was guilty off, and I was livid(briefly). Thankfully it was a misdirection and order was restored. I liked the story some people didn't and that's there opinion but for me it was fun and I was invested emotionally right till the end. I personally think it's a fitting end to the 9 films I've loved, (some more than others episode 1 and 2 I'm looking at you) even the last jedi (hated it) seems less bad now I know how the saga ends. My advice go see it and don't listen to the negative reviews even if you don't love it, it's the bookend to a great series.",1
5731,10.0,"I don't care what the critics have to say. By critics I mean ""not true fans of Star Wars"". Us fans that grew up and understand Star Wars can see the picture. Everything about this movie and how it ends was outstanding. Most of the rumors about returning actors were true and I'm not gonna say who. The Skywalker saga was an amazing experience. I'm in loss of words and emotion. I would go see a million times cuz it's that good. To all those that are big fans of Star Wars can appreciate this review and not disagree with me.",1

The bad thing about this movie is that there are many inconsistencies and lack of explanation in the script.

5734,2.0,"That's it, I can't say anything else good about this movie. There are blatant plot holes, no character development, lazy story writing. If George Lucas was dead he would be rolling in his grave, now, he is probably just sobbing in his multi-million dollar home. Probably regretting selling the studio to Disney. Such a bad ending to an amazing Franchise. I am so disappointed, I am writing my first ever IMdB review to get some form of closure.",0
5735,5.0,"So I just got done watching Rise of Skywalker. As I promised I wouldn't give out plot details or Spoilers, but my honest opinion is that I didn't like the movie. It recycled a lot of elements from Return of the Jedi with some extra plot points which should have been introduced in earlier films rather than the finale. Much of the movie to me felt catered to fans this time around and took a lot of pop shots at The Last Jedi. Overall cinematography by Dan Mindel was great and the acting was great, but they could have gone and did their own ending rather than carbon copy. So I'm going to give this one a 5/10 for me. They had so much potential but failed to deliver the finale they promised. To quote ""It's easy to digest, but not that filling or memorable.""",1
5736,8.0,We get some people hate this corporation that is Disney (wonder how many times they have been to Disney land),0
5737,9.0,I'm going to say it. It's the best numbered episode of Star Wars since 1983. The Rise of Skywalker aims a superlaser at the prequel trilogy and blows it six days from Alderaan. Episodes VII and VIII stand no chance.,1
5738,6.0,The Force is center of Skywalker family. Disney makes it easy like Avenger. The Force is not strong in this movie.,1

5743,8.0,Considering that JJ had to fix the disaster of the previous movie and at the same time make a movie... it is not bad at all.,0
5744,7.0,"I'm not an addict to the saga but I've watched all the movie. This final episode is quite good in my opinion. I would personally avoided some situation, but eventually the work is good. The dialogues between the characters are so basic, but that's cause 90% of the movie is action. I've seen worst",0
5745,10.0,It expands on what we need to know and concludes the saga in the best way. I don't understand why people complain when the plot isn't a retelling of a previous episode yet they still complain when anything is different. If you're a true Star Wars fan you'll love the final installment.,1
5746,9.0,"No spoilers...none. Just my opinion on the movie. My main focus when seeing a movie is to be entertained. That's it. I want to escape the reality of sitting in a seat watching a movie and be fully entertained . This movie ticks all the boxes for me. I have no idea what some of the other reviews are about. Disney killing Star Wars? I think it has more to do with Disney bashing then anything else....but hey...everybody has a right to their opinion. The movie is more then two hours long.....time flew by. I'm not much of a thinker....I don't really give a hoot about the writing, as long as it fits the movie. If I have to rationalize everything written or said in action movies, there would not be one movie worth watching. I mean really..........come on now",0
5747,7.0,"So. i just saw star wars. my honest opinion is that it was a pretty perfect ending to such an iconic series. some of the writing was a bit outlandish but it's star wars so so what. the comedy was mixed in brilliantly with the serious story and scenes. the plot twists were honestly brilliant. the only criticism i have is that for the first 1/3 had very strange pacing. far too fast. overall rating 8.5, very strong ending",1
5748,10.0,I thought this was the most emotional Star Wars of all the nine movies. What I enjoyed the most was Rey finally discovering the truth about who she is and how she fits into the Star Wars saga. I also thought the screenplay was excellent and I don't think reviewers are giving it enough credit seeing as it had to answer a lot of the questions from the first two movies.,1
5749,10.0,Loved it everything a true fan could hope for. Great ending leaves you wanting more.,1
5750,1.0,"I wanted to like this but it is absolutely soulless. They just wanted to put as many meaningless clips of ""cool"" shots together as possible. Every chance they had the took out any character growth. No sacrifices were made no reason to even care about the main characters were given. The Last Jedi had lots of problems but at least it had a message. This movie spent half its time just plowing over The Last Jedi and rewriting everything it tried to do. It felt like a director's beef taken out on us. I don't usually write reviews in fact this may be only one I just had to express my disappointment in this movie.",0
5751,7.0,"Let's face it: Disney didn't understand Star Wars. Some people like Rogue One and Solo, some don't, but it's a general opinion that VII - VIII and now IX could and should be better. There's a total lack of comprehension about the Star Wars Universe when people wrote and directed those movies.<br /><br />After a disastrous episode 8, 9 tried it best to overcome some points that made fans angry for 2 years now. And it succeed in some way, as it has only 2h30 screentime to do it while it still has to develop and end it all.<br /><br />So the movie seems rushed at it best, main characters lose importance and screen time, some new ones that shouldnt even been there appear. Introducing new characters in the last movie just to sell toys it just a minor problem in here.<br /><br />Technically (visuals, editind, acting, sound, art) it's perfect, but that's a minimum for a Star Wars movie. The scenarios are the best one from this trilogy, the planets feels unique and alive. Just the soundtrack seems kinda lacky as John Williams creates less than in other movies.<br /><br />I like it because it's Star Wars, i won't deny. But some major events doesn't add up with the canon and even if it tries it best to answer the huge amount of bad questions it predecessors raises, it still has some loose ends. Actually, the screenplay formula ressembles A LOT last Harry Potter movie. It's a formula that works, but for a saga that big, it should be innovative and remarkable by its original shape and content.",0

5753,9.0,"Went to see it last night and I'm shocked to find so many horrible reviews. Have we all seen the same movie?<br /><br />I loved it from start to finish. Sure, i have a couple of things that made me go 'huh?', but overall, I really loved it.<br /><br />For the not so good:<br /><br />Yes, there is quite a bit of location jumping in the beginning, it's very fast paced and there is a lot of stuff squeezed into the first half hour. My guess is, that they needed to write around the scenes with Carrie Fisher and see how they could use her dialogue from unused scenes from E7. So please, cut them some slack. Nobody knew Carrie was going to die when they filmed E7, so this sure wasn't an easy task. I like how they managed to in corporate her though.<br /><br />The whole Rose/Finn thing was treated like it never happened. I'm ok with that, although I would have liked their relationship to be more developed, it sure wasn't why I went to see the film. It was just weird that it wasn't mentioned AT ALL.<br /><br />The rest I really really enjoyed. I loved how the new main three (Rey/Poe/Finn) argued, worked, bickered and joked with each other. Their big hug brought me to tears.<br /><br />I also loved how they handled Kylo Ren's turn to the light side. THAT cameo was everything! And also, Ben Solo has always been set up for redemption and I thought it was beautifully done. I never would have thought that I'd be sad to see him become one with the force. His relationship with Rey has been developed over three films and I loved all of their scenes. The moment he realized that she has forgiven him was the saddest and happiest moment of the film imo.<br /><br />Another thing that I thought was well done, was how they brought back all our favorite Jedi, but not as force ghosts, just merely with voice cameos. Let's be honest, the whole thing would have been ridiculous if there had all of a sudden been 15 force ghosts standing around Rey to help her fight Palpatine.<br /><br />Also, it's nice to see that Leia wasn't just somewhat force sensitive or occasionally used the force. No, she was trained by Luke to be fullfledged Jedi.<br /><br />Now honestly, there is so much awesome in this film, that I can easily forgive it a few shortcomings.<br /><br />I already didn't understand why people hated TLJ.",1
5754,9.0,"A movie well worth watching. The intent was to give closure to the characters of the franchise and provide a feel good experience for the viewers. The story was more of the background for the movie to give you some missing pieces to 42 years of SW. The message was very heartwarming. No matter how bad you've been, you can still be redeemed. Never give up on those you love. Good defeats evil. If you've been a SW fan, go see this movie with an open mind and you will leave feeling very satisfied with the ending of the franchise.",1

No way to please alll parties in such a pan- generational epic we're all so invested in. BUT.... for me, managing expectations or having no expectations really helped.

5761,6.0,"Polarized world these days. Lots of 1s and 10s. Objectivity and being reasonable seems to be a lost thing. I'm 47, saw the first one ever in the cinema 1980, as it was rereleased before Empire. Was hooked before that, as I saw glimpses on TV. Even wrote love letters to Carrie Fisher as a 5 year old. Is a big fan of SW, but not uncritical. Loved OT, still do. Prequels where pretty stale, though ROTS was OK. TFA was pretty good imo, R1 was fine, even liked Solo, and thought it got way worse reception than it deserved. TLJ was the worst ever. Rian Johnson is an OK director, but giving him story carte blanche was really stupid. How Disney could go into full production on a close to a billion dollar trilogy, without clearing a complete storyline is mindboggling. Don't think they will make that mistake again. So the new one: Messy. JJ had an almost impossible task, but almost pulled it off, imo. Lots of stuff to complain about, if you want to. But several moving scenes, and the heart seems like it is in the right place, even if it's all committe in the end. Not great, not bad. Could have been waaaaay worse.

5765,8.0,"Spoilers. I was genuinely moved by this film. By the sacrifices that characters have to make - in this film and in the other films. By the way good things can go bad. How some of us can do things that are unforgivable and when we see our mistakes we know nothing we do can make up for it but it takes us higher. By the thought that we can come together, forget our petty individual concerns and make a change. And that family does not have to be by blood - it is by love. I wanted the opening shots to flow more majestically like A New Hope. I wanted the colours to be different. I didn't like seeing thousands of copy and paste CGI Star Destroyers - less is more. I didn't like yet another desert planet and yet another docking bay/prision rescue sequence. But I was so happy with the deeper story - Palpatine being re-animated like a Frankenstein makes sense - the Saga is His story too - as the Ultimate Evil it takes Luke, Leia, Rey, Kylo, Yoda, Ben, Obi Wan - all of them to tear him out by the roots like a weed. Everything that came before led to this. It was so sad that Leia knew she had to turn Ben but that he would die and so would she. That Rey sacrificed herself for the greater good. And Ben did too. That Rey would always have the taint of the repulsive Emperor - no wonder she wanted to change her name. That her parents were murdered. I felt the victory was hard won. And the writers, cast and director sold this to me - it hits you emotionally. Maybe I'm sensitive, maybe I'm not cynical - but that's what I loved about this film. It gave me hope and transcended individual ego and was about truth and love.",1

To be honest, I wish it was 3hrs long so we could've had more time with some of the elements in this film.

5775,8.0,"I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan like a lot of people are even though I enjoy watching them. I loved the originals, hated the prequels and thought TFA was miles better than TLJ however ROS is superb, big effects, funny, cheesy heroic banter and it also ties up the story with an ending that I think everyone (Star Wars fans) will be happy with. For me it just beats TFA and is the closest to the originals as you'll get. It brought back memories of when I first saw return of the Jedi and I remembered what I loved about them as a kid.",1
5776,7.0,Really I don't see any other way to tie up the saga so well done JJ. Not the best SW film by far but still a must see. Don't believe all the terrible reviews. Watch for yourself and decide.,1
5777,5.0,I love original star wars trilogy.<br /><br />story wise & few bits here and there.. after watching prequels for long years since they were out and several times.. I accepted them as a OK necessity even tho they are mostly bad or boring in general.,0
5778,1.0,I like Force Awakens and Last Jedi. Because they are telling us something. But this film is like a Disney Channel cartoons. Everything happens randomly. Movie sometimes can be fast an some times slow. There are too many cringe moments.,0
5779,10.0,Of course we have these toxic fanboys cry on here because either their theories did not pan out or this did not fallow the EU to the tee. So as a diehard fan of star wars who by the way was disappointed in the last jedi I find this by far the best of the new trilogy. JJ had so much to fix and he did so. I am wondering if the haters actually paid attention to the movie or are blinded by the hate of Disney buying star wars. Unless they rogue one it. Cheap fan made film it. The rise of Skywalker to me had so many elements and tied it all together nicely with great action and emotions. I was compelled to write this review on the fact that they babies are trying hard to downgrade any review they can by using many different accounts. Without spoiling it we get some answers and we get some pondering and points to certain things. I loved this movie. I been a fan of the movies since I can remember and though nothing comes close to the originals I would put this 4th of all time after three of the originals. My two worst in my opinion being last jedi and attack of the clones. Do not listen to the toxic fanbase. Watch it yourself with an open mind and have fun.,1
5780,2.0,I voted with two stars only because it is a Star Wars movie,0
5781,10.0,THE BEST STAR WARS EVER MADE AND THE PERFECT ENDING,1
5782,8.0,"I just dont know whats wrong with people these days....I mean can anyone be satisfied? Stop complaining and just watch the damn thing, and enjoy the final adventure.",1
5783,3.0,"I love Star Wars. I grew up on the originals. I celebrated the new three and finally was excited to welcome my daughters to the final three in the saga. What a waste. No story, character development was lackluster and meaningless. This final installment put the nail in the coffin of a series that never should have happened. This last chapter felt less than any Star Wars I've seen and that's saying a lot. I hope if there is ever another trilogy there's actual story telling involve and they avoid rehash kings like JJ Abrams. He's shown he can't execute on original ideas and needs his movies to be theme park feel good trash. Not the worst movie ever but the worst of all the Wars. Pass on this till it's out on digital.",0
5784,2.0,"Poor plot, badly written. An embarrassing use of Carrie Fisher. The last of three films that shouldn't have been made.",0
5785,8.0,"This movie can be flawed at times and is shot at breakneck pace but but that shouldn't put you off this enjoyable entry in the franchise. The visuals and characters are amazing with a lot of it appealing to the fans. Might not be the best but still a good movie, don't listen to the reviews of 1/10 or 10/10 they are simply not true.",1
5786,10.0,Best Star wars movie all the time. A great story and awesome actors. The final battle and the force was strong. Definetly the best film in this year.,1
5787,8.0,"Challenges faced by the creator and writter are immensely great! It feels a bit disconnected in between this one and TLJ. However, I enjoyed how things play out. I came and seriously expected the worst and I came out feeling like they have done it! Ot was a good movie, not all that super brilliant however certainlly successfull.",1
5788,2.0,Well good day everyone there will be no spoilers or anything like that I came here because I was so disappointed with the storytelling and the actors cut scenes basically everything in this movie seemed low budget for a Star Wars film. It's like they were trying to save money everywhere so maybe that's what they really were doing so they could gouge the money from your pockets and make the most they can under the pure greed principle. It has cheap Star Wars clichés in its production and the actors you virtually just don't even care about them. So everybody giving it a low score these are the accurate scores. So it looks like JJ Abrams is in this film but I don't even care to look I'm just seeing it in people's reviews. I've seen the guy on YouTube and I know I don't like him I think he trashes movies and should never have become a director. I really feel that way about him I've disliked too much of the things he does. To put it blunt he doesn't have any heart and soul and Star Wars is not his project and never was. George Lucas I wish you would come back but I guess this Star Wars stuff is all behind you so maybe it should be behind all of us. They're just trashing it for the quick buck. If anyone does see my review just don't spend a penny on this and then if you wish go ahead and watch it. I have nothing else to say thanks for your time and too bad the memories of Star wars is all some of us older folks will have from the days George Lucas created his dream.,0
5789,5.0,"The title says it all. The final battle was really appealing and the ending was something that could be a good conclusion to the saga. However, the poor and super fast pacing destroys any character development efforts in the script. If the movie was an hour longer, this would have been less noticable",0
5790,8.0,"I've been reading through the reviews and have come to the conclusion that there is no group of fans more toxic than that of the Star Wars fandom. I've grown up watching Star Wars and am absolutely in love with the series.<br /><br />The movie, with its moment of Disney cringe and questionable moves, was actually very good. It seems to be men who would ""rather watch Mamma Mia or even Ghostbusters"" who are putting the movie down. Get over the fact that the main character is a woman and enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Like I said it's not perfect but everyone I know enjoyed it. It's Star Wars for heavens sake and for me it keeps the importance of the originals. The importance of sticking together and defeating the dark.<br /><br />Stop putting this movie down. Not worth the negative energy.",1
5791,10.0,"Those griping about the lack of consistency and continuity with the original movies may be right, but this movie has a great story and wraps up enough of the story to pass onto the next generations.. As someone who was 8 when A Last Hope was in theaters for the first time, this movie took me back to the feeling of watching them and also threw a bit of stuff from the other Star Wars media. It's a good mix of old and new and does a pretty nice job of wrapping things up of the latest trilogy..",1
5792,2.0,"After the mess of Last Jedi, Abrams should have done everything in his hand to solve the problems. Although it seems like he has done a good job there are boring side plots and one dimensional characters scattered all over the intergalactic universe of star wars. It could have been epic as any other Star Wars movie but it is simply not.",0
5793,10.0,One of the best movie experience I have ever had; a worthy ending to an epic film journey.,1
5794,8.0,"The final instalment of the Skywalker saga is a thrill ride throughout. Abrams had a hard task tying the story together, especially after the curve balls of The Last Jedi, which though a great film on it's own probably challenged where the story could go. The Rise Of Skywalker has divided the fandom but if you make a Star Wars movie then you're on a hiding to nothing! Enjoy the ride, it has some great moments and though not perfect, there is lots for everyone to enjoy.",1
5795,7.0,I think that this movie is very good conclusion to the sequel trilogy if you can even call it that as every film in the sequel trilogy has tried to put do the previous by deleting the previous films ideas and story arcs. Which is why this film suffered with such a low score in my opinion however the other reason this film suffered was that the director JJ Abrams did not get to have his cut used and the leaks suggest his cut would've been much better of an end to everything. The overall film is fun to watch when you turn your brain off but if you watch it as a hardcore star wars fan you will notice tons of problems. But I let some of these problems off because of how bad The Last Jedi was and how much of a better direction this film went in but I think this film would've definitely been better if it was two parts and actually acknowledged the force awakens more. For it to actually feel like a trilogy if JJ wanted to delete The Last Jedi from the existing Canon.<br /><br />Nevertheless I this film is worth a watch whether you're a star wars fan or not.,0
5796,5.0,"I gave this movie a five because although it has some interesting elements (cinematography, vfx) the plot of the movie is very weak making it more of a redo of the last Jedi more than the final movie of the saga.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />Also with some elements introduced in this movie makes the older movies seem stupid, for example with the force heal thing, Anakin could have saved Padme making his turn to the dark side stupid and makes the Jedi look like dumb for not telling Anakin this and causing their own destruction",0
5797,9.0,"Too many high expectations, this is Star Wars! It answers questions the last one didn't, delivers the fun, adventure and grandness you want from Star Wars. Go see, don't expect the world and ENJOY!",1
5798,8.0,"Ya, I went in not expecting much. I was actually ready to look for faults right from the jump. But I got converted in about 10 minutes. It was a fun ride, and a good patch job after Johnson crapped all over the set ups from TFA. There really wasn't much anyone could have done better in terms of getting back into the true Star Wars feel than Abrams pulled off here. Sure, it's full of silliness, but so are the originals. 'I am the spy!' made me laugh out loud, and so did many other scenes. And it was a joyful laughter.",1
5799,10.0,This is not a bad movie! In fact considering the way the last Jedi was left off it's a hell of movie. Just think what it could of been if JJ directed them all. The force awakens is a great movie and could of left this franchise on the verge of greatness only be to ruined buy a bad directed movie. Such a shame. All in all I thing JJ did a great job to bring a bit a decently back to the hole saga. Hats off.,0
5800,9.0,I am a HUGE Star Wars fan! I can see where people are coming from with their complaints. But.... man I really enjoyed Rise of Skywalker. Loved the movie! Did an excellent job at answering questions and tying everything together. Really loved the characters in the movie as well.,1
5801,1.0,"Terribly made movie, it was a nightmare to watch.",0
5802,10.0,"An excellent Star Wars movie, fun, fast-paced, beautifully made. Rey finally had her doubts, Ben finally was not a loser, the Princess got the closure she had deserved, Rose had a proper haircut. Finally I had a feeling that the galaxy is alive, that the secondary characters also have their personalities. From the very first minute I knew the movie will be different, the humour felt much like the Marvel one. I laughed a lot, but also cried like a baby during some scenes. Fantastic SFX, beautiful music, and lots lots lots of nods to the life-long fans, such as myself. I feel the saga got a proper conclusion, and I want to see it again. Great movie.",1
5803,9.0,"Movie was fantastic! Only gripe I had was the level of exposition and quick explanations in the film for issues that should have been covered in previous films. I understand JJ had to do this to explain the short comings of The Last Jedi. TLJ should have handled some of these items. JJ put them in the best he could. These moments did not take away from the quality of the movie. You just notice these things as a fan of the franchise. Great story, great actors, great performances and satisfying ending. My heart was beating during the big moments. As a life long Star Wars fan I'm happy with this. Yes the trilogy could have been better planned out but this is what we got and I'm ok with that. Go out and see it!",1
5804,8.0,Much better than Eps 7 and 8.<br /><br />I went in thinking it was going to be awful and I actually enjoyed it. So ignore the reviews and go and watch it and make your own mind up.,0
5805,3.0,With Rise of Skywaker the cultural phenomenon of Star Wars look like a thing from a galaxy far away: Episode IX delivers a good amount of visual candy and some nostalgia scenes but nothing more than cheap entertainment.<br /><br />Saying Star Wars is only a movie was never easy but now everyone agrees.,0
5806,2.0,The only reason you should watch this movie is to disappoint in it,0
5807,1.0,"Didn't reach the fans expectations at all. It's disappointing, not just story wise, but also withing special effects",0
5808,6.0,"I see people complaining about how bad this movie is and most of them probably haven't even seen it. This movie is a very good movie that makes you forget about the terrible things that were done in The Last Jedi and leaves you satisfied when you walk out of the theatre. I wasn't expecting anything when I went to see it. I just had a ""I'm gonna watch it 'cause I have to"" mentality, but turns out I really enjoyed it. Of course this movie isn't perfect, but generally speaking, it is a good Star Wars film that's better than many other Star Wars movies that have been done in the past and it really does a good job developing these new characters to the point that you can feel connected to them in a way you couldn't in the first two films of the trilogy. I guess the best thing I can recommend you is to just go see it and have your own opinion. Don't take my word for it and certainly don't take the word of anyone who says this is a 1/10 for it. We tend to base our own opinions on other people's and I think that's a big problem.",1
5809,8.0,"Released around the same time, can any serious star wars fan hate this so much and rate it so low. I went to the cinema to see episode iv.. So ive an OPINION. I loath the prequels. But for anyone who likes go to a galaxy far away. The prequels aside, give each movie its merit. The original 3 are the greatest. But. Rouge one is my close to favourite, n thats disney.. too critical you are..",1
5810,10.0,"I dont like that Disney bought Star wars. I think the newest triologi is bad. But man for an ending! Mabye you can find faults it the storytelling and alot of negatives, but you can geek alot in this film. They went back to the orginals with music, places and caracters. I yelled WOOH! several times in the theatre. I got goosbumps and even a tear. Dont get to stuck on that everyting must be 100% tied together. Just enjoy the show. Best SW sice the first triologi by far! May the force be with you!",1
5811,10.0,"I truly don't know why people are rating this movie so low. I loved every minute of it! The only thing that bugged me, was the fact that Rey was climbing stuff with her hands and feet, when she could have easily levitated herself.",1
5812,8.0,"Like the movie, pretty much so, yes. I like all of them.",0
5813,5.0,"The CGI = phenomenal. The acting = top notch. The world they are inhabiting = completely epic. The story = garbage. I understand the emperor was brought back in the comics, but this half-hearted attempt to mesh profit and shoving fandom into one film was a complete failure from a story standpoint. The emperor is a completely unnecessary villain, and how he has his body makes no sense, and Finn's character is wasted as is Rose's (she's basically not even in it), and the relationship between Rey and Ben is a problem to say the least, and I don't want to imagine that the emperor got it on at any point and had kids plz and thank you... Also Rey killing the emperor after he told her to and then it actually being good is like what just happened? And they can only come up with a fleet of death stars as easy to destroy as the original, which they made Rogue One to explain why it was, and everyone in the galaxy coming in to join a basically impossible fight after no one did in the last film against a far more beatable enemy, just like - what? There was no effort put into this, and to top it off, the supposed LGBTQIA+ scene they were talking up isn't even noticeable - I've watched the movie twice, known it would be there both times, and still haven't seen it. Thanks Disney for this - and oh yeah, Anakin is totally pathetic I guess for not just knowing you can kiss someone to save their life. Ugh.",0
5814,8.0,"Most of the negative reviews I have read here don't explain 'logically' what they really hated about the movie. They are mostly just complaining that as a fan I am disappointed. It's more like going with the herd on what other 'fans' think or say. If you really hate it explain with logic and examples why you did! I liked the movie because it was entertaining. It could have been shorter but it was enjoyable. I don't claim to be mega fan but I have seen all Star Wars movies. This is neither less or not more than the others. But don't listen to haters who claim they know the series when it's not even a creation of their own minds! Go, see for yourself, and enjoy!",1
5815,3.0,"After the really bad 'The Last Jedi', my expectations were quite low to begin with. Still the movie managed to disappoint me big time. If you like mainstream superhero movies you might like this, but this has nothing to do with Star Wars except the setting. Really bad writing, silly humor and an overall lack of an interesting concept make this one of the worst films of the saga. Sadly it shows that filmmaking has changed a lot nowadays with mainstream movies and shows focusing solely on entertainment, political correctness and merchandise sales afterwards. There is nothing in this film that is challenging or at least interesting. Just some fancy effects and bland dialogues. Filled with plot holes and uninspired story twists (if you might even call it that) this is just another product of today's marketing industry. Watch it and make up your own mind, but don't oversee its shortcomings because of the hype train. It's just a bad, meaningless and forgettable movie featuring the exact same blueprint as all modern entertainment. Don't think, don't question, just put your brain on standby, enjoy this crap fest because the mainstream dictates it, repeat. Oh, and don't forget to buy the ultra steelbook limited whatever edition afterwards so the studios know they succeed and continue to produce crap like this. I'm sad, really...",0
5816,5.0,"The dead being the Star wars sequels!<br /><br />I really wanted this film to work. This felt like a Michael Bay film, great if you want to switch your brain off and go along for the ride. But Star wars was never about switching your brain off!",1

I love the prequels but I surely can say they are the worst trilogy out of all three (but they are still good to a certain extent). At first I saw the reviews trashing this movie and I was worried that this would be the first movie out of the new trilogy that I didn't like (I love TLJ and TFA) but I came out of the theater firmly believing this is the best out of the 3. It expands on things that made TLJ great and does more. Heck even if you didn't like TLJ you might love this one. Such a satisfy end to the Star Wars Saga.,1

It had every a real Star Wars fan could ever ask for; heart, closure, excitement, twists, love. It is by far my favorite of all the Star Wars movies. Everything about the film checked off all of the boxes for me and except for Ben's death, we all know he deserved better !!!!!!!

Possibly, is it because Disney have made 2 very average films in this trilogy ( that's being polite ) this is a lot more likely.<br /><br />Tory had no game plan, no start middle and finish, I've been watching interviews with Kathleen Kennedy who yes died have a very good portfolio of films, buts she's come out and clearly said they've winged this, what an absolute joke, a kick in the teeth to every fan there is, but why should she she care right, she has more money than any of us will ever have right ?<br /><br />Now if I get back from seeing this tonight andI've found it amazing and it completely redeems the trilogy I'll come back and delete this, bug I doubt it !",1

It had the potentiality to be a great one, but a few things here and there held it back. It was a fast paced movie, everything felt a little rushed.

I believe this may be a part of the reason for the negative reviews. The Rise of Skywalker offers fantastic visuals and a new storyline that is not reminiscent of previous films. For those who have seen all the movies, read some of the comics/books, watched the cartoon series of the Clone Wars and Rebels...there are plenty of fun easter eggs throughout the film. Thanks J.J., these are always appreciated! With major things to cover in a short time it may feel to some like the plot is rushed or has holes but I feel it is all logical and makes sense. Go see this without expectations and enjoy it for what it is...an entertaining movie bringing closure to a beloved series. It is worthwhile!",1

5852,8.0,You know what you're getting here so just enjoy it,1
5853,5.0,"SW7 was an opening thrill ride and SW8 was the confusing turn, SW9 is the end of the ride with a deathfall straight to a cliff.<br /><br />Every supporting character in this movie was like ""oh, this person called, that's why I'm helping you. I believe you can do it"". The other factor is how bad the screenplay was, it is so predictable, especially the ending.<br /><br />I already kinda have a bad feeling from the trailer, but i encourage myself to not judging to fast. Turn out it is actually dissapointing.<br /><br />But thank you for taking it an end.",0
5854,8.0,A lot of people out there slamming this film for reasons I can not understand. The film engaged me from the off. The story was good and the action and effects were fabulous. Was it perfect? No. Hence the 8/10. But did I sit in the cinema for 2 hours and enjoy myself? Absolutely. Go and make your own mind up.,1
5855,7.0,"This movie is indeed a mixed bag. The first half is all over the place. There is no real purpose, a confused tone, just over all a complete mess. But the second half feels like a Starwars from 35 years ago. It's charming, likeable and a complete nostalgia trip.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />For me this change happened when Han Solo appeared as a memory for Kylo/Ben. It was a heartfull scene brilliantly acted by Harrison Ford and from there on I was completely on board. This movie absolutely dislikes TLJ and it shows. They listend to the fans, killed of stupid characters, left other ones with almost no screentime (rose) and again, like the force awakens, they worked like the return of the Jedi sorywise and I think that is good thing. I must admit a am completely biased as a true Starwars fan and the nostalgia completely resonated with me. Many of these good moments don't work if you don't know the older films (4,5,6) and so this movie can't stand alone. It is a safe bet that I really enjoyed and will be looking forward to it making a nice addition to my collection.",0
5856,1.0,The reality that SW fanboys are giving this movie high marks is the only reason it's not under 5 stars where it belongs. Plot hole galore. Right down there with the prequels :/,0
5857,9.0,"Movingly Film, absolutely the best of this trilogy, always twists, there is too action, special effects magnificent, rather, always better. Being a big fan of star wars, i love seeing new planets, thus, even more spectacular. As a fan I would have given a 10, but unfortunately, I have not seen the clash with the lightsabers that I hoped for, so I give a well deserved 9.5. May the force be with you.",1
5858,5.0,"Rise Of Skywalker is a clunky finale to the Skywalker Saga that has great setup and a lacklustre finale that doesn't quite stick the landing. Some of the positives were the handling of Rey and Kylo Ren with Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley both giving great performances, as well as being uniquely shot with a great Score and Visual Effects. On the other hand this movie would have greatly benefited from being 3 hours long similar to Avengers : Endgame, as story threads don't get as well developed as needed. The complete ignorance to the prequel trilogy is also rage ensuing as this movie makes Darth Vader's sacrifice in Return Of The Jedi pointless and only has one appearance of Anakin as a voice in Rey's head. It was also an awful decision to only have Luke and Leia appear as force ghosts in the last scene where Ben Solo and Anakin Skywalker (the 2 other Skywalker's) are left out. Another poor decision was to make Kylo and Rey somewhat of a romance with a completely forced kiss at the end that felt unnatural and out of place. I believe that Rise Of Skywalker will completely divide the fans just as The Last Jedi did and could have been so much better if Disney and J.J Abrams had made some more bold decisions with the ending and included elements from the prequel trilogy.",0
5859,6.0,"It's like we know what is going to happen from the beginning and I don't like the story. One thing that hold me 2 hours to watch this was the visuals. I don't know how chewie and zori was alive, totally disaster.",0
5860,10.0,"Besides the action and CGI I believe that this was a fantastic wrap up of the ennealogy. Rey internal conflict and subsequent duel with Kylo kept you wondering where she would turn. I could see, from the audience, that the loss of Princess Leia was a huge blow even though it was already known. Her aiding Rey a the crucial moment to take down Kylo then ultimately save him and allow Ben to re-emerge was great moment. The appearance of Han Solo to Ben allowed for Ben to see torn feelings for his real family return and mend. Then the final shreds of hope we're starting to fade in the battle with the Final Order it seems that the whole galaxy shows up to help. The battle of the ultimate wills to save the universe between Palpatine and Rey was epic with Ben redeeming himself. What a fitting end to symbolically bury the last remains of the battle and end where we started so very long ago. Personally I couldn't think of a more fitting end to the saga.",1
5861,10.0,True fans will love it. Ignore the fake fans and their hatred.,1
5862,10.0,"With all that is being said, I have come to the conclusion it is impossible to make a Star Wars movie that satisfies the critics and the big fans. Those two groups have an inverse correlation with what they want both Star Wars to be and the movies themselves.",0
5863,4.0,"The Rise of Skywalker ?? There was no ""Rise"" and there were no Skywalker!!<br /><br />All of them are dead now Luke, Leia and Kylo.<br /><br />Certainly, Rey wasn't Skywalker. It can not be that easy, when she said that she is Rey Skywalker at the end I felt like I was watching some adventure movie which was made for kids! (just like the other hundreds of lines)",0
5864,10.0,"Way too many wannabe critics bashing a well made movie. Only because something didn't go the way they would write/direct/produce it. Well, if their vision is that great, they'd be getting paid for it, not one of the best directors of my time.",1
5865,8.0,RANKING AND STAR RATIONS FOR ALL 15 FILMS:,0
5866,2.0,"Well honestly it could've been good, but they just overused the force. The lightsabre block for example. I also find it quite funny how palpatine can basically destroy all the rebel ships and then suddenly after Rey stops him, the ships are perfectly fine again. It's just way too forced for the rebels to win, it could've at lesat been a small sith victory, but no it was a happy end afterall. Thanks disney.",1
5867,5.0,"This movie is so strange it has a lot of cool stuf but a lot of opertunity's where wasted for example: the sith troopers (the red stormtroopers) they could have been the new death troopers but instead they are just as easaly beaten as normal stormtroopers. Speaking about that, i dont like how rey and crew kill stormtroopers with no efford for example: when they go to get chewie back from the first order they rush thru the base killing stormtroopers like its nothing. But i do realy realy like the first half of this movie where their on the scavengerhunt whe get to see the crew hang out and go on this adventure and i LOVE IT!! But once rey goes to the death star 2 (or whats left of it) tne movie slowly goes down for me. So in conclusion i like this movie but i know its not realy that good a lot of potenteal wasted",0
5868,2.0,I had to take a break after the first hour of creating problems then solving them which seemed a tad pointless but stuck with it and glad I did.. I think JJ set out the first part of the film to get rid of the mess from TLJ. Really enjoyed the second half and the ending. Not amazing but not annoyed,0
5869,10.0,"This film just didn't deliver the answers or the explanations that it needed to. Just saying ""I fell"" and ""I was behind everthing"" doesn't satisfy why things happened. I'm not going to even get into the ridiculousness of that fleets massive size, the fact that all those ships were built by whom. Furthermore, who crewed them?<br /><br />We seen legions of past Sith Lord's in the temple, but it would have been insane to actually see individual Sith Lords like Exar Kun, Revan, Bane, all channeling their strength into Palpatine. Conversely, why do we get to see like 200k Sith Lords, but only ghost Luke helps Rey? If she represents the last of the Jedi, why couldn't we see Yoda, Anakin, Qui Gon, Obi-Wan or some of the past Jedi Masters?<br /><br />Why does Palpatine have to be hooked to the Hellraiser 2 Dr. Channard-looking apparatus? If he is all powerful, he should have had an insane duel. Palpatine was supposedly the best Sith duelist of all time... Why not get down and dispatch a newbie with ease.<br /><br />It's tragic how they fail to respect years of training and knowledge passed down from masters to apprentices. Somehow, these few Jedi characters are so strong that they just happen to know all the force techniques with no instruction. Ancient Sith went to Academies where they practiced dueling and force mastery for YEARS, as did Jedi padawans. Obi-Wan and Anakin both lost in a duel to Dooku but Rey, the short timer can beat Palpatine, Dooku's far superior Master?<br /><br />Only two Sith Way-finders (holocrons) exist, and one is just sitting in the second death stars throne room? Nobody went and pillaged that place? If the Emporer lived, he would have sent someone to retrieve it.... Was Snoke a modified Emporer clone?<br /><br />Why did Palpatine continue to use the Sith Lightning on Rey when she was blocking it with the Saber? We saw that already with Windu and the Emperor should have remembered how weak that made him.<br /><br />I don't really understand Finn's purpose in the entire arc. He is basically, just there and kinda helping. They invented absurd events to give him meaning, but sneaking on Snoke's command ship?<br /><br />I love Star Wars. I have since the first time I seen it in '84. They really messed up throwing out all the cannon stories and then rushing stuff out with inferior plots. We had super fan authors creating content for decades that was so integrated that all were seamless in the overall story. Would have much rather seen the Black Fleet with Grand Admiral Thrawn, Admiral Daala's Maw Fleet, or the Yuuzhan Vong. This movie felt like a cheap version of Return of the Jedi. Single Jedi, somehow trained and ready to go, has to face the Emporer. Ground team clears the way for the ragtag fleet to attack and defeat a far superior unbeatable fleet. Dark Sith redemption and return to the light side. I mean they copied the entire plot. They even threw in Lando piloting the Falcon straight out of the movie! Disappointed. I just hope they continue with different stories that they can't mess up. Solo was good as was Rogue 1. Mandalorian is must see so far.",0
5870,6.0,"I think the fans are just too hard to please with Star Wars. This movie has faults, i agree, poor dialogues for sure. But the things we learn about the Force are totally incredible, I was like a child in the theater. The end was perfect to me, back to the basics. Great FX. Great characters. Some questions are still without answers, waiting for other star wars stuff !",1
5871,8.0,"The Sequel trilogy has always had its problems. This mainly comes as a result of Disney and the writers not having a plan mapped out before undertaking the trilling. That being said, I do think this film and ending benefits from the challenges presented to it from the Last Jedi. It becomes more original as a result.",0
5872,10.0,"Don't believe the critics who want to force their negative opinions on you: the Skywalker Saga's greatest, old-school antagonist returns from the past, and his evil puppet master character works so well in the final conflict between him and the new generation's heroine. If the previous episode left a bitter taste in your mouth, then this motion picture is a beautiful glass of sweet wine. An epic ending of a 42-year old story.",1
5873,10.0,"The first half is kind of a mess, with things happening way too fast. But I don't thing JJ had a choice. The second half is where the story starts to develop and when the movie becomes interesting.<br /><br />It is not the best of the saga but is the best of the new trilogy. Why? Because Disney finally understood no one cares about the new characters and all people wants to see is Luke, Leia, Han, Chewe and the droids. So this movie is all about erase the wreckage Rian Johnson mane in TLJ. This was Disney's apologies to what they tried to do with SW. The movie is full of Fan Service but is understandable. As Rogue One, The Rise of Skywalker feels like SW, at last.",0
5874,9.0,"After watching the movie, i just feel numb. not extremely happy or sad. The movie is just a patch for eposide 8. The story mostly just trying to set straight about what happen on episode 8. And it just doesn't feel natural and forced.",1
5875,5.0,"I'm not gonna pretend I'm some movie expert of a professional critic. All I can say is that if you're a Star Wars fan like me and look for a good time you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The movie isn't perfect it has its fair share of issues, pacing being the biggest one of them. The movie drags heavily in its first hour but it picks up in the second half and the ending is just fantastic.<br /><br />It relies heavily on nostalgia and fan service, but as a fan of the franchise I am aware that this is kinda what we all wanted anyway.<br /><br />It plays homage to the originals and pretty much retcons most of The Last Jedi. To conclude if you want a fun Star Wars experience and didn't like The Last Jedi you're probably gonna like this one too.",1
5876,7.0,I read all this reviews and i am wonder what they are expecting to see?this movie its very good but for me TLJ is better.just go and watch the movie and enjoy the end of a magic trip.bad reviews ruins everything.,1

5880,9.0,"The biggest critic is a Star Wars critic.<br /><br />Growing up with the films you can't please everyone. The 2 new ones to me were trash, especially the last Jedi. But the final instalment wasn't too bad considering.<br /><br />Go in expecting it to be as garbage as the other two and you'll come out shockingly surprised with this one.<br /><br />Especially cause Rose (the Jar Jar Binks of the franchise) found out she was worse than bantha foodo and is barely in it!",0
5881,7.0,"The film was okay, but if it was anymore boring I would've fell asleep at the theatre. My biggest problem with this film was the lack of hygiene the characters had, I mean does Chewbacca ever damn shave?! And Palpatine just looks too hideous for me and looks like he hasn't showered in decades, considering this is a film watched by many children I think having such famous characters, potential famous role models for children lacking even the most basic sense of hygiene is a pretty poor way for our children to follow!",0
5882,4.0,"So, this movie was...a mess. Things didn't make sense from the very beginning, you know it when you read the first line that slide up with the logo. ""The dead talk!"" Something like that, a joke really. Then we have a trio that has zero chemistry, this is from the writing I guess, their interactions are just poor, a pity. JJ eager to finally show the audience these heroes together just came up with more non sense: quick adventures that we don't really care about and zero character development with forgettable dialogues. Finn now is Rey's babysitter, which becomes annoying by the end of the movie. And I'm still not sure what was the deal with the new characters if they ignored all the old and good ones. I'm talking to you, Hux and Rose. A shame and a waste.<br /><br />Everything is so rushed and we feel like something is missing, something that should connect everything. This movie is all over the place. Not funny, not deep.<br /><br />And then at the end, JJ was just sadistic... I mean, to have a full theater cheer for a character like Ben Solo, to have everyone excited when they kiss to just kill him afterwards... I mean, the guy DISAPPEAR just like that. Everyone went silent and when the movie ended the message was not of hope, at all! Leaving the movie theater I, at least, didn't hear one single positive comment about the end. It's sad, really. So much potential and for me it was just that, potential.",0
5883,2.0,"Lets start with this, i am not a hardcore fan of Star wars but i have watched every Star Wars movies from the original trilogy, the prequel to this new trilogy. This is easily the best out of all. I reckon most people that gave a negative rating are those that went to the cinema with tons of expectation and the movie turns out to be different than what they expected. Honestly i almost skip this movie because of all these bad reviews. Hopefully i didnt. In conclusion, go and watch this movie. It does what a movie have to do, it entertains and it has one of the most amazing visual you have ever seen.",0

5890,9.0,I never wrote reviews for anything....ever.... but this despicable money grabbing endeavor Disney put out was a travesty to a mythos of a generation.,0
5891,1.0,"This movie had the potential to be great. But it spends most of it's runtime redoing The Last Jedi, instead of going along with it to make a more cohesive trilogy. I liked The Last Jedi so it makes me kinda mad when they retcon everything the previous movie did just to appeal to the angry Star Wars nerds who didn't get The Last Jedi.",0
5892,4.0,"While the film certainly has flaws, holes, and imperfections you can pick out, if you go into the movie as a fan who loves Star Wars rather than as a critic, you will likely truly love what you see. There is so much to enjoy and love about this movie so I say give it a chance, have an open mind. Personally, I felt like a kid again watching Star Wars for the first time and if that's not the purpose of a series like Star Wars, I don't know what is.",1
5893,10.0,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and a film fanatic in general. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is something super special that everyone hates because it doesn't make them ""feel"" a particular way, like this film doesn't complete their own personal feelings about Star Wars as a whole. I understand that and I feel that way myself about some aspects of this movie, but that's no reason to give an awful objective rating. Beyond any spoilers, huge moments, the (possibly unnecessary) amount of suspense - Sure, you could have predicted that all Disney could think to do was make Rey Palpetine's Granddaughter. That's a huge spoiler but low-key you knew that all a long... sort of. It seems too real. Seems like it shouldn't connect but it does. This is exactly the train of thought Rey has in her discovery, which is essentially the entirety of this movie. It's supsenseful and chaotic and seems like destiny is playing itself out before you (just as Rey experiences all of it. This is a deep character study for her and Kylo Ren both. You have feel for these two to understand the story, which many people refuse to even attempt because of loyal nostalgic ties to other characters. It's easy to empathize with them if you go into this film with no expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this and will definitely be headed back for a second viewing this weekend.",0
5894,9.0,"Disney was handed a huge softball to hit out of the park and just missed it. Reused plots and terrible character development. I hope they learn from the Mandalorian that Star Wars doesnt need bigger and louder, just develop the different characters, backgrounds, relationships, races. That was just another big budget Hollywood movie that didn't follow the rules of a beloved franchise.",0
5895,1.0,"While I enjoyed myself watching The Rise of Skywalker, it is not a great movie. Most of the complaints I have heard have been about how ridiculous, fast-paced, and messy this movie is. But the more I consider these issues, none of them would have been an issue had Rian Johnson progressed J. J. Abrams's story. Instead, Johnson tried to make what a Star Wars movie was in his opinion instead of what the fans wanted. The Last Jedi did not progress anything, in fact the story is back at square one by the end; Rey has barely learned anything, Luke barely did anything except show that Johnson does not understand his character, the Casino planet was a waste of time, Holdo could have saved so much time and panic had she just told everyone they were going to seek refuge on the nearest base, and Snoke (the supposed new big villain) is killed without any story to his character.",0
5896,7.0,"The entire Sequel Trilogy is a bad remake of the original Star Wars trilogy ruined by a social political agenda that destroys the original characters story's replacing them with pathetic tropes , live memes , bad writing , and predictably bad acting.

I feel like after the failure of the Last Jedi. I feel like they threw out all plot and logic out of the door and be like ""Hey, let's make another Star Wars film just for the hell of it."" Most of the new characters we meet are just pointless people who we won't care about and the old people that came back into the movie(Lando and Wedge) are some what cameos. While It is a fun film. It didn't have La Passion like how George Lucas put into both the originals and prequels(Yeah, I'm that type of fan).<br /><br />I will always love star wars. and the 6 movies that Mr. lucas made are the films I'll always hold dear to. And the sequel trilogy is somethime I'm probably not going to care about. Now I'm not going to hate on these films like all the other moronic fans out there.

Not only does the final Star Wars movie ignore the work of the previous new trilogy movies, it completely wrecks a lot of the story created in the original trilogy and even the prequels.

Not a single one of the huge reveals and emotional moments is earned and despite some cool visuals, they leave you wondering how and why almost every time. Babu Frick is the one positive thing introduced by this movie, give him a spinoff show on Disney plus immediately.",0
5905,3.0,Having watched this for the 2nd time at home this week there was a lot of detail I missed from seeing it at the cinema. It was certainly more of the Star Wars genre than ep8 and gave a better take on the story. However I just didn't get the ending. Why would she choose skywalker? And where was Ben or Anakin force ghosts?<br /><br />I have now read that different endings were planned and filmed where Ben would've lived which would've been much better in the story.<br /><br />Adam driver and Ian mcdiarmid gave outstanding performances and I thought the way Carrie fisher was included as Princess Leia was seamless and a great tribute to her.<br /><br />I am looking forward to more from Star Wars which might make more sense of this ending .,1

5913,10.0,"'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' is the film fans have been anticipating since the announcement of a sequel trilogy. For nearly half a decade we had no idea what was to come of a sequel trilogy. 'The Force Awakens' introduced us to many new characters and hardships, and of course continued the stories of the original trilogy. There was hope for the continuation of the Star Wars franchise until 'The Last Jedi', which practically had nothing to offer to the story as a whole. Director Rian Johnson scrapped many of the ideas from the previous movie, and tried to go in a different direction. Now we have JJ Abrams back in the directors chair for episode 9 trying to wrap everything up. The full story is a mess due to two directors trying to go two different directions with the characters. These films are tied between paying homage to the original trilogy and bringing something entirely new to the table. They can't please everyone. 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a very visually pleasing movie. Many of shots are beautifully done, and the action sequences are exciting. John Williams' score is wonderfully done. The music, along with the visuals, are really breathtaking at times. The film falls flat with the character development in the end. It's no secret that Palpatine is back. This is a bold move for director JJ Abrams. Fans loved the idea of Anakin saving his son and bringing balance to the force in the end of episode 6 by killing The Emperor. What does that all mean now that we know Palpatine was alive the whole time? Either way, the film isn't absolutely awful. It's fine and worth watching if you've followed the sequel trilogy so far. Nothing will ever be like the original trilogy and fans need to accept that.",0

Perhaps it is the complicated father and son relationship between Vader and Luke or the scoundrel under the name Han Solo that attracts the love of a beautiful princess. Whatever the reason we were used to Star Wars episodes that were based on original content.

This movie showed this as a battle inside of people, and an actual physical battle.<br /><br />The battle within Rey and Kylo is the best part of the entire trilogy. Their connection is so strong, yet their battles are the opposite. Ben is good, but chose the dark - he thinks he cannot return. Rey is born into the dark, but chose the light. Both of their character developments are beautiful. Ben is a story of redemption while Rey is a story of overcoming her own nature. Their relationship throughout the trilogy leads up to this fantastic conclusion. Rey kills Ben out of anger, but then she heals him because of her kind spirit. This and his mother's call causes Kylo to die with the fatal blow, but causes Ben to be reborn with Rey's healing. He then returns the favor by healing Rey, killings himself. That brief exchange between the two after his sacrifice is everything I wanted to see. Their connection is so strong and powerful that they just embrace each other and look into each other's eyes - both finally in the light. Their kiss is the way they solidified their connection and love for one another. I don't think it was a romantic kiss, but one out of deep love and respect. I wish he hadn't have died, but his death was necessary because he ""returned"" the energy loaned to him by Rey in the first place.<br /><br />Rey and Ben has some of the best character development I've seen in a film or series not to mention the incredible acting throughout. This movie fulfilled what it set out to do.",1
5923,9.0,"I'll never understand why Star Wars fans love to hate on the franchise lately. I understand the issues with The Last Jedi (even though I don't agree with the them), but they ended this finale flawlessly. If you're reading through these reviews considering if you want to see it in the theater or not, go see it. You'll love it, unless you're just anti-Disney. If you enjoyed VII and VIII you will absolutely love IX.",1
5924,10.0,"I watched it and it got me so emotional. Rise of skywalker is actually pretty good, full of excitement and surely the best from since force awaken. Please don't compare it with the last jedi. Just go and watch it!",1
5925,9.0,"Ok, as a movie in general, this is alright. But after watching all of the star wars movies, how does this movie make sense in any way? Emperor Palpatine coming back to life ruins what the first six star wars movies are trying to tell. Darth Vader sacrificed himself to save Luke and kill Palpatine. Vader could have lived if this was how the story was going to end. Overall, the acting in this movie is great. I have no complaints there. The plot may make sense if you're not watching the other star wars movies.",0

5928,10.0,I waited a long time before seeing this film (like the previous) due to my faultering interest after the first 2 trilogies.<br /><br />I feel the last trilogy was rehash/cahotic/uninteresting.,1
5929,5.0,"If you just like anything with big yellow writing at the beginning, or you like bright swords that make 'zum, zum' sounds, then you'll probably like this movie. Those who are Star Wars fans though should really be offended with how poor this movie is. It seems rushed, like they had to pack too much in and throw in characters just for merchandise reasons. The ending is absolutely stupid with the Emperor who is back killing himself by shooting electricity at 2 lightsabers, cos one couldnt hack it. Instead of just stopping he burns up. Then follows the most awkward on screen kiss going! Other things that annoy is the apparent death of Chewie as Rey blows up a transport with her force lightning powers because guess what shes a Palpatine, and Chewie is onboard. Fake out, hes not because apparently there was 2 transports, despite us only seeing one take off. In 5 mins Lando can summon a whole load of people to fight the first order despite everybody having lost hope in the Last Jedi. The Resistance celebrates the war ending after the Emperors fleet is defeated, despite the First Order still very much being out there and having a huge fleet and an army that can control the galaxy still. But hey the won against a threat that wasnt even apparent until the beginning of this movie so yay! The force can now teleport things and you can fight with someone in different locations, rip necklaces off people on different planets. The knights of Ren are awful and dont even speak, they instantly betray Kylo Wren when he goes good at the end, despite never even meeting the Emperor. Hux, yes arguably one of the main villains of the past 2 movies, the man who command Star Killer Base dies in the most ridiculous way ever. Totally undersells the character. All the Emperors Star Destroyers have planet killing lasers on them, but if you shoot the laser which is easily done it blows up the whole ship. Major design flaw there. These Star Destroyers were made under ice too and break through the ice to rise. Wouldn't this damage them? Also it appears they dont have any shielding. This is just a few of the stupid things in the Rise of Skywalker. There are so many more. Reason I gave it a 4? Some good acting from time to time and Fin and Poes bromance is infectious and fun.",0
5930,4.0,"After The Last Jedi pretty much destroyed every character and plot thread in both the new trilogy and the old one, and the death of Carrie Fisher, the makers had an unenviable starting point for this one. All things considered I think they did a pretty decent job.",0
5931,7.0,"I went into this film with trepidation given the mixed reviews. But I need not have worried. A masterpiece that drew together the complex narrative of four decades of story telling in a manner I can only describe as glorious. I know some didn't see this film this way. I can't understand why. But all I can tell you is I walked into the cinema when I was six to see episode IV, and it captivated me like no film has since. And at 47 I left the cinema after seeing episode IX and felt that same sense of awe . A story of a lifetime.",1
5932,10.0,"The Rise of Skywalker isn't the best Star Wars movie, but it's a satisfying conclusion to the character arcs introduced in Episode 7. The plot can be a little over the top but remained interesting throughout. The visuals and music are as excellent as in any other Star Wars story.",1
5933,8.0,Please for the live of god ignore all the bad ratings here. This is the best film ever and is the perfect ending to this beloved saga. I love STAR WARS and probably like the biggest fan out there so PLEASE don't listen to all the idiots giving this movie a bad rating. It is incredible.,1
5934,10.0,"Don't listen to the 1/10 reviews on here. There are some people who want to spread their hate so badly that they will create multiple accounts just to review bomb things. Was the movie perfect? No. Was it great? No. I would say that it wasn't bad. It has some issues with rushing the plot, some things seemed out of place, but you could tell some things were set up in The Force Awakens, completely ignored or forgotten in The Last Jedi, then continued in this movie. I enjoyed it overall, however, I did think the ending was a little lackluster, and they didn't completely tie everything up. Overall worth the watch, had some good action and cinematography, some fun sequences, and they did their best considering what they had to work with. Ignore the jackasses and give it a try, you might enjoy it, you might not, it is certainly no 1/10.",1
5935,6.0,"My first review on IMDB and I had to after watching this movie, it was amazing. It carries true spirit and the action keeps going at a fast pace. Twists and turns, after watching all the star wars movies throughout the years this was a pleasure to watch, it really did capture my heart again. Significant moments that created the soul of star wars were captured again and used at the right time... Looking out at the two suns is one very important spiritual moment in the series for me, it's even commented in a book called the five stages of the soul. If you just analyse everything, you'll miss it's essence. To me it was perfect.",1
5936,10.0,Sequels were already bad (except rogue one) no surprise this is the worst..,0
5937,1.0,Horrible to sit through hard to watch honestly didn't think the trilogy could get worse until I watched this give it a 2 for special effects,0
5938,2.0,The plot was really bland and weak. It seems like they tried to close the loop on everything but it was rushed and poorly executed. It has very little entertainment value. I would just wait until it came out on redbox. Not worth the money or the effort. I watched it for free overseas and I did regret having to wait in line for it.,0
5939,3.0,"Many negative reviews are more about how they think the story should be.. I grew up with the original trilogy, and was pleasantly surprised by the direction and reveals in this movie! It all makes sense if you don't narrow your thinking to your own bias of what you thought should happen! Bravo on a very well done finale!",1
5940,10.0,"First off I do not get why people hate on the new trilogy. It has soooooo many great things. It might have some bad but the great overshadows it. We get this new protagonist,Rey,who is one of my favorite characters in anything. I also think Daisy Ridley is a great actor. She especially shines in this one, and so does Jon Boyega as Finn. Rey is a great character for many reasons. She is smart, crafty, and very powerful! Its what this world needs to see. To keep it short because I could go on forever, this movie brings so much cool action, fun, adventure, drama, comedy, and general suspense! May I add that Kylo Ren is awesome (Adam Driver kills it as always).",1
5941,10.0,"Gareth Edwards should of been director ,his effort for rogue one has been the best star wars film since the original trilogy. Love JJ but you can see he's been held back by Disney and political rules",0
5942,5.0,"Overall good film with perhaps a little too much fan service. Suffers also from having to correct the many mistakes and 'subverting your expectations' nonsense from the TLJ. Ideally some of the ideas from this film should have been laid in episode 8. Having said all that. It was a good star wars film. If you're a fan of star wars, you'll be happy leaving the cinema.",1
5943,8.0,3-PO was the best part of the movie imo. It's just one giant mess of a plot. They wasted talented actors again.,0
5944,3.0,"1st hour of the movie had non stop quick camera switch every 2 seconds, multiple characters rapid firing one liner or one word dialogs interlaced with one another. It was like watching a movie in fast forward mode. Fortunately the crazy editing stopped about 1/3 or 1/2 into the film and finally the movie camera switch slowed down to a normal rate for adult human to watch.",0
5945,5.0,"Touching, thrilling, great cgi. Best Star Wars ever",1
5946,5.0,"I've been a die hard Star Wars fan for the longest time. I've loved all the movies and I even defended the sequels so well against haters but now this movie kind of kicks you in the gut especially the end. The movie was way to fast and frantic, there wasn't much time to process things like Leia's passing and moments like that. It had a good plot and the actors were phenomenal absolutely blow away By Driver and Ridleys performances. Especially with such a raw and emotional final scene together they managed to pull it of spectacularly. The one thing that got me along with so many others was Ben Solos death. Some may argue it was necessary but with him dying it conveys the wrong message that people who are emotionally abused and tormented don't deserve happiness. Apart from a few minor plot holes here and there, bens death and the fast pace I think it's an ok movie. I'll be seeing it again because I'm a die hard but maybe only one or two more times",1
5947,9.0,"Overall, I felt like this was the best plot of the new trilogy. That being said, it could have been executed much better. Honestly, I don't know why they were so dead set on this being a trilogy. This movie was rushed, and it showed throughout the entire film. This could have easily been two parts that broke up the story and gave time for development. I still suggest going to see this movie, but you won't need to see it again. Also whomever wrote the opening credits.... Really? That's the best you could do?",1

5950,8.0,"I read comments, and see ratings... And I start to wonder - what is it that some of you expect from Star Wars movies? You act like original trilogy is some kind of screenwriting, story-telling master-piece. It is not, really. I love all SW movies - they are fun and amusing, and that's all, and that is enough for me... For intelligent writing and deeper stories I will watch some other works.",1
5951,7.0,"I couldn't stand The Last Jedi, but this was fantastic. Wrapped up loads of dodgy threads left hanging from TLJ and brought a fitting end to the saga. Can't wait to see it again. JJ brought it home!",1
5952,9.0,"I loved it!! it is a very worthy end to star wars. To the people who get off on hating, i say, why??? it was fun, funny, fast paced, it captured all the elements that made me become a lifelong fan in 1977. If you are going in expecting to see Shakespeare then you're at the wrong movie. Every film including star wars has its its issues. If escapism was perfect we'd never stop watching movies. I plan to see this beautiful addition to SW many more times and feel all the highs and lows over and over.",1
5953,10.0,"Rise of Skywalker is been getting hate for quite some time. People either hate it or love it. While the film is flawed in multiple ways, it wasn't bad. Problems include pacing, to much cramped into it, Finn as a character, Palpatine's plan, and a lack of explaining things. These flaws warrant anger but things like Rey and Kylo Ren, emotion, cinematography, nostalgia, acting, line delivery, decent enough script, and action packed scenes make up for it. People also are upset over fake deaths scenes. Chewbacca, Kylo Ren (when Rey stabbed him), C-3P0, and Rey herself. Personally it doesn't bother me and each scene has something else going on. Before Chewbacca's ""death"" you can see the other transport, hinting at his survival. 3P0's sacrifice is played off as a joke and his survival is hinted when the characters mention that his best friend, R2-D2, has backed up his memory. Ren is the main villain and other main character so it makes sense he wouldn't die so quickly. And Rey is THE main character so it makes sense she's brought back to life. And Star Wars has had fake deaths before. Maul, Gregor, Rex, Ahsoka, Obi-Wan (kind of), and Vader. It's more noticeable because it's multiple in one film. I focused on the fake deaths a lot and I could go into more but the point is: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a flawed film but it makes up for it.",0
5954,,"One of the best movies we've seen. Great plot with a perfect ending... for Reylo fans especially. Emotional. Epic. Action-packed with an endearing cast. Loved everyone. Rey (Daisy) and Ben (Adam) in particular. Enjoyed the synergy and the struggle. Can't believe people are giving it less than 6 stars. It deserves 10, but to rate it below 6 is to be uncharitable or utterly blind to everything that is right about this film.",1

5956,5.0,"SPaCe HoRsEs😐😐 When i watched ""Star Wars: Solo"" i didn't think it could get any worse. It's actually embaressing how you destroyed your whole reputation just for a series like mandalorian to save you. Please sell Star Wars to somone who can actually write a script.",0
5957,1.0,"Overlook the unexplained (and seriously overpowered) capabilities of the sith and this had the potential to be so much more. I can forgive the lapse in bridging events from episode 8, I can forgive the unoriginal battle tactics (let's hit that obvious target to incapacitate the entire fleet), but what I cannot forgive is that end fight. What on earth happened to palpatine having a lightsaber? I get that the power he wields is truly immense, but to end the scene within one minute of achieving ultimate power is ridiculous. Why was palpatine not restored to his pre episode 3 self? Whilst I can appreciate lightsaber battles aren't everyone's cup of tea, why couldn't there be one last duel? For me this film just raised so many questions, when in reality it should close the arc.",1

5960,4.0,"For me the movie was brilliant. It was always going to be hard to do Star Wars so far down the line like these 9 movies have been spread out. The first 3 or should I say 4,5 & 6 was just out of this world. I think there has been ups and downs. However, it still has been a great adventure.",1
5961,10.0,"The reality is that this trilogy isn't as good as the original was. But let's be honest, that's very hard. I think they have 3 good films, but they just don't join them up to tell an epic story. The plot needs a little more thought. Some good characters are not fully explored into depth, and it feels like they have too many characters not getting enough screen time. And Palpatine. I just don't get it. If you were going to do this - bring him into the TFA and give him some structure with a better plot line. Sadly my favourite character didn't get enough of a final swan-song.",1
5962,7.0,"Don't give into the dark side, this movie is a solid 8.5. There's of course points that aren't great, but there is no reason for the screaming disappointment and hate other than to just do so. This movie hits strong on so levels and it felt like a great movie and ending.",1

5964,10.0,I'm disheartened to see all the negative reviews on here as I had a really good time with Rise of Skywalker. My expectations were low after The Last Jedi and some of the negative hype but the film was a success for me and made me feel like Star Wars had been redeemed by the end of it. It got off to a strong start then there were a few shaky scenes that got me worried but I was steadily swept up in it until the by the end I was fully engaged. There were a couple of scenes that could be described as stretching it a bit but I was having so much fun that I forgave them very quickly.,1

5966,1.0,"Yet another Star Wars film that has to compete with the expectations of episodes 4, 5 and 6. It's not going to happen. Critcs and fans are right, the audience is lambasted with overdone action and nostalgia. The acting is not horrible, and one or two actually pull off some decent depth (Oscar Issac and of course the magical Anthony Daniels). The CGI was a bit much. And the story just seemed.... lazy. David Lynch should have directed this one. I love all Star Wars films. I've seen all of them first run. I loved this one, but it will be in the bottom half of the 11 to date. It's worth the price of admission. Once.",0

This is the main reason I don't often give low ratings. On the times I'm wrong, I tend to move on quickly and don't bother critiquing.<br /><br />The sequels were a disappointment for a lot of older fans, myself included. I loved the prequels, animated series and pretty much all things Star Wars. I spent decades reading the books and comics of the EU, and dreamed of seeing the entire story on the screen. Lucas's original nine movies were the greatest unknown in sci-fi/fantasy lore, and was endlessly discussed. Even George talked about it, and teased the idea for so long that we had built up some impossible expectations. We pretty much thought that we would eventually get some stuff from the EU before he finished the story himself, but then it became a reality. The fans were divided of course, but we gained another entire generation of Star War fans.<br /><br />This made me more pleased than anything else. It meant that I would continue to get more stories from A galaxy far far away....<br /><br />Whether you liked the prequels or not, the sequels failed from the beginning. They should have had Lucas involved in the story, if NOTHING else. This lost two large shares of fans right away.<br /><br />Then because of the disjointed process, they failed to tell a coherent story that would win the next generation of fans.<br /><br />I gave it four because I will always love the franchise and Lucasfilm still makes a beautiful movie with the best effects on screen. The rest was unforgivable to end the greatest story of a generation, and failed to meet the standards of the franchise.",0

It suffered from awful pacing, a lack of consistency and continuity from earlier movies, and it feels like the creators were desperate to make up whatever they could just to move the plot forward. In the end, not a lot of it made a whole lot of sense in my head. However, the movie was incredibly entertaining to watch because of how hilariously stupid it felt from time to time. We sat in the cinema and did our best trying not to burst into laughter during what was probably supposed to be a serious or emotional scene. It even got to the point where you had to ask if the creators themselves even took it seriously. So, while not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, I still had a fun time watching it.",0

Who knows but I can say it's a great time and a great star wars movie.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did",1
6002,9.0,"On one side you have Disney. Legendary in its historical productions. On the other you have Star Wars, one of the most potent franchise ever created. Then how come the Disney's Star Wars movies are so so bad? This is inline with the (Disney's) former. It's a shake up of former movie, poorly written, poorly realized (look at the webs of the abandoned space ship, or the fake snow in the village, or the lights in the cabin of poe in the last battle...amateurish to say the least...want to see how to make spectaculare and credible visual effects? Watch Oblivion) . It's the movie where the force is totally missing...everyone who should be a Jedi does not transmit any jedi quality. And the villains...shall we say there was no better idea than to revive Palpatine. It's so disappointing it makes me want to cry. I couldn't find any original idea in this movie. It's like those social where you see a report for the millionth time. Really DISNEY with STAR WARS in its hands couldn't do better? Well it hardly could do worse.",0

6005,10.0,"There were awesome landscapes , funny looking aliens and great visuals. The story was ok. But the movie was lacking a strong villain (Palpatine wasn't portrayed well in my opinion) , funny jokes and a surprising story. All together it is a movie you should watch in theaters but don't expect something special.",1
6006,7.0,"Loved it, amazing. I loved every second and it was one of the best Star Wars movies I have seen",1
6007,10.0,"I watched this last night in the cinema and to be honest i couldn't of wished for a batter start, middle and end of the film, it was absolutely Amazing, was on the edge of my seat a few times, think I might go back to the cinema to watch it again 😊😊",1
6008,10.0,The thing that I would firstly say is that this film would have been a lot better if the Last Jedi would have followed the story arcs set in place in the force awakens. This film has to find the finish a saga when all of the story arcs set up by Abrams in TFA had been destroyed in the TLJ. Meaning that that the third movie was always going to be hard no matter what. JJ coming in late in the day for this film didn't help but it would have been a better movie if he was at the helm for the 3 of them.,1
6009,7.0,"This is the best one of the last three star wars movies.<br /><br />JJ Abrams saved the star wars saga, Rian Johnson did a very bad job with episode 8...",1
6010,10.0,How do I start on this terrible film...<br /><br />The plot felt like a video game plot. Not tied together well at all. One scene jumped from another. When compared to the jumping of scene to scene in the last Jedi it went over to much time and left to much questions.,0
6011,1.0,"The people that are valuing the movie under the 8... I don't know which movie they saw, ¡is an amazing movie!",1
6012,8.0,"Don't bother with all negative reactions. This episode is really good, and balanced (not like part 4-6, which I never really liked). For the first time in my life I really liked 3D!<br /><br />Superior technique.<br /><br />Go and watch it for yourself",1
6013,9.0,"The Rise of Skywalker brought the Star Wars saga to a dissapointing close. Although it is not a bad movie, The Rise of Skywalker suffered from a poor plot and overall lack of imagination. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and co performed well but couldn't save the movie from being a mediocre end to an absolutely wonderful saga.",0
6014,6.0,"This movie is the prime example of how little Hollywood gives for originality, if there is a buck to be made. It lacks the thought and touch that made the old movie such a thrilling movie experience and it cares not for the laws of this magnificent universe. It's a technical masterpiece of what the media can do to this day, but nothing more. This will be loved by the Michael bay loving types, and good for them, but it will be forgotten in the end.",1
6015,4.0,"I'll start off by saying that I wish some things were handled differently. That, however, does not make it a bad film. I am very thankful for all of the people who had a hand in this film and think they did well with what they had.",0
6016,9.0,"The OG Trilogy are masterpieces and that's it. Star Wars ended with Return of the Jedi in 1983. The prequels are boring and embarrassing, the sequels are just lazy and make no sense. Star Wars is creatively bankrupt and nobody can see it.",0
6017,1.0,I absolutely loved the final film. A satisfying ending to a wonderful journey. I get why some people are complaining particularly with the return of Palpatine and not enough depth goes into how he returns. However in the books it hints he returns due to sith alchemy which is where they try and recreate people as clones with force power. Overall i loved the film and would happily watch it again.,1
6018,10.0,"The haters have already had their say. Surprise surprise, such sad negativity. The force is weak with them.<br /><br />NOW<br /><br />JJ Abrams has done a cracking job here. You will surely smile, be sad be in tune with many emotions. I adore Star Wars, I'm happy to admit this. I accept it's flawed in many areas, and every film.",1
6019,10.0,"For the record I've been a life long sw fan, was involved in a fan movie (the empire strikes backyard - YouTube) and hated tfa and tlj. This was the first sw film for twenty years I didn't see at 00:01 on the day of release, so disenchanted was I with both its lazy, pc predecessors.",1
6020,9.0,"I went in with low expectations given the reviews so maybe that coloured how I saw it. I agree with a comment I saw, that this feels like both of JJ's planned sequels squashed into one movie, while ignoring one of the major points of the previous film. The pacing is just awful. The first 10 minutes could have been half a movie and from there we're taken on a tour of a few new planets including an interplanetary Burning Man.<br /><br />After a while of feeling angry at the pacing, I calmed down and started paying attention to what was good. Rey and Kylo's arc is continues in a satisfactory manner and concludes almost as well. The emperor, all things considered, was an interesting addition. He was clearly meant to be the big reveal at the end of the previous film, which could have been cool. Everything looks great obviously and the set pieces are as fun as usual.",0
6021,6.0,"I know lots of people are going to be analyzing this film frame by frame to point out all the faults, but why? This film is what Star Wars always has been: a kids movie. Even the original film didn't have Academy award winning acting or a complex story. It was made to wow 8-year-olds. That the story didn't somehow ""mature"" over 42 years isn't the fault of the movie or the writers. Take your kid or your grandkid, and you'll see that they are still doing what they did when we were kids: wowing 8-year-olds.",1
6022,8.0,"Just saw the movie, witnessed people laughing, crying in tears, being completely silent in epic battle scenes when all hope was lost and the cinema was in Finland. Compared to previous trilogy installments made in the 21st century, this is best by far.",1
6023,9.0,"I don't even know where to begin here. This movie is just a mess. I've loved every single film, yes even The Last Jedi... but this just wasn't it. Most of my issues come from Disney more than the film itself, they made Abrams cut 20 mins out of the movie and they cut another 20 behind his back and filmed a different ending without his knowing as well. Had it not been missing an entire hour almost I'm sure it would've been fine but we'll have to hope they release the Abrams Cut. But now on to the review itself.",0
6024,3.0,"Boring, Stupid, and overall just a waste of time, so much potential for a better way to end an already mediocre series. Saying the first two of these three was any good is generous statement but at least they were kind of fun, that being said this is the worst of the three. I'll watch all of the other movies here and again but I don't think I'd ever watch this one again unless someone paid me to.",0
6025,3.0,"I'm a long time Star Wars fan, I've seen every single Star Wars literally dozens of times. I would watch them when I'd get home from school, when I was running on the treadmill, when my parents weren't home and I had nothing to do. I'd have them as background fodder while doing homework. They were basically always on for me, I always had something Star Wars playing in my home. This sentiment applies to the first 6. P.s. I would give this review less than one star because it literally is corporate cash grabbing.",0
6026,1.0,"Catering to fans is a dangerous way to go.While it may seem to make sense to want to pleas your target audience, in the end though all it does is muddle creative intent, and that's exactly what happened here.",1
6027,3.0,"An absolutely poor movie in script, performances and effects ... Disney laughs at the viewer's intelligence as if he believed that just writing star wars in the title was worth it ... this new trilogy brings nothing to the universe of star wars, and the forced end that shows a conglomerate of images of the previous films puts the end to a universe that should never have expanded in this painful way and with so little tact to the fans ...",0
6028,2.0,The end wow thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was introduced to Star Wars as a young child and have seen 6 of the 9 trilogy films in theaters opening night. My only disappointment is this was the end. Thankful I was present to see it come to an end! Go see this movie any negativity comes from those who don't truly understand or love what the movies are about or understand the vision behind them. I will always cherish this Saga that spawned over 30 years. Thank you to all that contributed.,1
6029,10.0,"Honestly, I had faith in J.J because even though I wasn't a fan of TFA, it had potential. TLJ was a horrible disappointment to me and I lost all interest in this trilogy for a while. I liked the trailer a bit but didn't dare hope. Watched the movie tonight against my will (lol) and omg. I was immersed. It felt like my Star Wars with a just a dash of Final Fantasy and Harry Potter and I can proudly call myself a Star Wars fan again. I think they did every character justice, I'm glad Rose had a smaller role, I actually liked Rey?! I appreciate that she cried less than before. Poe and Finn are great in this. The new characters were great and I don't think that the complaints I've heard fit at all. Honestly, I loved this movie. It's in my top...4, at least! I can't say more than that the angry reviews are confusing.",0
6030,10.0,Reconned? Oh absolutely. Did JJ need to fit 3 1/2 hours worth of material into a 2 hour and 15 min film to make it all fly. Most definitely.,0
6031,9.0,"Seen it Saturday and it was AWESOME, I don't care about the people who say it was bad or Disney messed Star Wars up, Rise of Skywalker was damn good I wanted to watch it again and still do.<br /><br />I am very happy J.J Abrams was the director I think he had the feel of Star Wars when he did the Force Awakens, would love to see him do another Star Wars movie.",1
6032,10.0,This movie is just disney trying but also failing to please nostalgia. Predictable from the 20 minute mark.,0
6033,4.0,"More of the same. You can see the repetition of the original trilogy's storyline, especially in this movie. Wins points for tugging at your emotions in some of the final parts of the movie. In general, it's lacking in originality. Not awful, but definitely not great.",1
6034,7.0,"This movie could have been much more concise. There were so many changes in direction it became very confusing for me. As a standalone it never established its characters very well. If you had never seen the previous Star Wars: ""The Last Jedi"" movie, you would not have had a clue what was going on. Some very good performances and spectacular CGI come to a semi-satisfying resolution. No Star Wars movies have matched the first three.",0
6035,7.0,It was a movie. Technically a movie. Best if luck on the next trilogy.,1
6036,5.0,"I don't understand what's wrong with negative review, i'm a star wars fan and i love the movie, it was really really good",1
6037,9.0,"This movie is made thinking of Star Wars fans. As I am one of them, I loved it. I do not share the negative reviews.",1
6038,8.0,"Overall, when I first watched this in December 2019 I felt it to be both gratifying and amusing although slightly part of the experience was the lead up or excitement around the films release. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and seeing a end to a sequel trilogy I had enjoyed seeing as it shone a new light over a saga which had not been explored past that point. It's a hugely ambitious project, but wonderful new characters and original stories suffer for the sake of fan service.",1
6039,7.0,"Star Wars fans are toxic. There is no pleasing them no matter how great the movie is. I was on the edge of my seat during this whole film. There was not a dull moment. J.J. Abrams is a master of cinematic arts. The Star Wars saga is supposed to mirror itself and this is exactly what it did with for return of the Jedi. Also bringing palpatine back was genius because in the prequels he talks of the Sith Lord that had discovered how to come back from the dead. The story came full circle, and was a great conclusion to the saga. I laughed, sweated, and even teared up a few times throughout the film. Star Wars has been a part of my life since i was a child and getting to see the stories continue has been a great pleasure. All of the films have amazing and awesome aspects while they all have things that might be questionable as well, but to think that George Lucas came up with all of these characters and worlds so long ago, and that the legacy has continued this long is amazing to me. J.J. Abrams grew up with these movies, and if I'm not mistaken are a major reason he got into film making. To say he didn't do it justice is ridiculous. We live in a time where everyone can be a critic, so i say watch the movie, and decide for yourself. I feel it deserves a much better rating than it has, but that's my opinion. I will rewatch this along with the other Star Wars films for years to come. The formula for fanboys is Empire strikes Back, and have issues with all the other films. Ewoks were dumb in return. Prequels had too much cgi, medaclorines, and jar jar, so they all suck, force awakens was the same as a new hope, last Jedi threw away all the important questions, Luke drank milk from a sea cow, and was bad. Kylo ren is emo........ i dare anyone else to do better than the new trilogy. I'm sure everyone would criticize them just as harshly.",1
6040,10.0,Rushing story and too much unnecessary elements with force. Very dissapointing for whole series. Not much 3D elements and very weak plot even with plot twists. I really reccomend them to remake whole last 3 movies or change it to different sequels if there will be any future Star Wars movies because Star Wars is highly damaged with this trilogy.,1
6041,3.0,I was very pleased with the send off of a story 42 years in the making. I have no idea why people are giving it 1 stars. All I can say is ignore them and see it for yourself,0
6042,10.0,I loved it. J. J. Abrams did it again. The movie has a good story and amazing graphics. The evolution of Rey's powers was crafted beautifully. There are many shocking moments in the movie. The end especially is good,1
6043,8.0,I am not a Star Wars fan so I'm reviewing this purely as a movie.,0
6044,4.0,So ... I watched this finally and I'm genuinely confused why Ben (kylo ren) has like... zero lines in the last hour of this film? He never speaks after the battle on the Death Star and it makes no sense why? Did the actor have an accident or something? That can't have been on purpose right? Right???,1
6045,3.0,One of the best fanfics I've ever seen!,1
6046,4.0,"To start with, there wasn't one moment when watching this film where I wasn't glued to the action or the great character scenes. By the end of the film, I thought it was a great piece of entertainment. It didn't feel like the ending to the 9 film saga though.",1
6047,7.0,"No movie can be perfect. Don't expect this one to be. That being said, it's a good end to the series. There's a lot of bias in these reviews. It's a great way to cap off this trilogy. Don't go in with expectations for it to be the best movie of the decade. Go in remembering all the reasons you love Star Wars, and you'll like it.",1
6048,7.0,"Critics aren't too thrilled with Rise of Skywalker. Well, I'll tell you what, that's fine by me. They loved ""The Last Jedi,"" and it was terrible. Abrams finished the story masterfully, and he made a movie that was for the fan, not the critic. It was a walk down memory lane telling a new story. I've been a Star Wars geek my whole life, and the finale did not disappoint. It was 99.9% perfect! You don't get to ""riff"" on a classic the way The Last Jedi did; you have to stay true to it. That's what this film did. It was a no holds barred finale for this 45 year old kid that remembers the movies from childhood. Don't let the dark side fool you; this is a win!",1
6049,10.0,"Some unnecessary pandering in the final 10 or 15 minutes to try to please different fans but other than that I enjoyed the adventure. But I didnt go into the movie thinking I was a writer or executive producer. I went to watch the movie as a fan and viewer. It's not my story to tell, it's my story to hear. Star Wars fans are horrible, this is no surprise.",0
6050,9.0,"It is end game, but better, the scenes are incredible, the fights - choreography was incredible, the story and the pace was actually mind blowing, I expected it to be horrible and it's by FAR the greatest movie I have ever seen. Will rewatch.",1
6051,10.0,What a beautiful film. Incredible ending to the best film franchise of all time. Honestly I'm speechless.,1
6052,10.0,Just be real. Y'all are just silly. Just stop. C'mon y'all. It was good. Just c'mon.,0
6053,9.0,"As an loyal officer of the Empire, I must say that I was eagerly awaiting the release of Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.

I was excited to see the defeat of the rebel scum and the restoration of the true order in the galaxy.",1
6054,4.0,"JJ Abrams, the cast, and the crew delivered on all of my hopes with this one. Can't say thank you enough to them for such a fitting and touching end. Best Star Wars movie since Empire.",1
6055,10.0,"Being a huge fan of the original trilogy and enjoying the lore of the prequel trilogy, I can respect and finally see where J.J Abrams was going with the Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker. Turns out Rey is a Palpatine and wouldn't be revealed until episode IX, where Abrams wanted to clue us into new mysteries and to raise new questions in order to keep us on our toes. Examples of this is introducing a new villain like Supreme Leader Snoke, who really was a puppet and clone of Palpatine.",0
6056,8.0,"Saw it on the premiere night, and then on Blu-Ray last night. I think this is a great movie with amazing visuals and engaging story. Sure, it has its Star Warsy nonsense moments, but Star Wars has always been like that. It's a family adventure movie, not hard sci fi... I genuinely do not understand the hate for this movie, and I think it did an outstanding job of correcting the shortcomings of the last one.",1
6057,7.0,I won't try to convince you to love it or hate it. Everyone seems divided. But to me there was many missed opportunities and way too much filler for a 2 hour plus movie. Too many new characters that did not pay off. The ending felt just like return of the Jedi. There was a lot of too forced comedy dialogue.,0
6058,6.0,"Look, is it a perfect movie, no. But don't believe the close minded negativity that this film is receiving.",1
6059,8.0,"Everyone knew that this movie would get terrible reviews because of the radical fan base. But if you can look beyond the anger and the hate of other people writing about the rest of the lives of those heroes you had in your childhood, you'll appreciate what they have done. It is a satisfying end to a saga, closing most gaps and opening the future to this amazing universe. It is the best of the new trilogy and an outstanding action movie. I laughed, I thrilled, I cried. A great movie experience.",1
6060,9.0,"I think Disney should have had at least a hint of inspiration from ""Duel Of the Fates"", Colin Trevorrow's version of Episode IX that would have been superior to Rise of Skywalker in plenty of ways. The duel between Rey and Kylo Ren was nice to watch and it wasn't the first time we learn of Emperor Palpatine resurrecting himself by cloning and yeah, you can hear someone saying cloning. He was also able to do so in the legends timeline. What some Star Wars fans would consider a mind**** is when Kylo Ren reveals Rey was the daughter of a Palpatine clone!",1
6061,6.0,"JJ really was delt a crappy hand, he had to save Star Wars twice. As someone who didn't like The Last Jedi, this movie almost completely ignores it. That's a good thing, you can really tell that JJ had a vision for this trilogy than Rian Johnson completely ignored. The film is filled with fan service and some plot conveniences, but what good Star Wars movie isn't without it's own flaws. My only real issues would be pacing and it is slightly overstuffed.",0
6062,9.0,One star for being a star war.<br /><br />One star for Babu Frik.<br /><br />No more stars. This movie is an insult to both stars and wars.,0
6063,2.0,"To be honest my expectations towards this movie weren't very high but I was really excited after I came out of the cinema. To me this is beyond any doubt the best movie of the new trilogy. Is this a perfect movie? No, it has some flaws and cheesy moments, but the story is much better than in ep 7 & 8, it evokes much more emotions, the characters and the actors doing a great job.<br /><br />For me episode 8 was a total catastrophe, director Rion Johnson doing an egotrip and ignoring everything episode 7 has built up. Luckily Abrams and his Team were able to correct most of the damage done by Johnson.",1
6064,10.0,"I finally watched it. I had to. It was much like having to visit a deceased loved one at the undertakers. I didn't want to do it, but I had to. Just to say goodbye.<br /><br />Just like the end of a prolonged terminal illness there was relief as well as sadness.<br /><br />everybody feels some guilt at feeling the relief. Nobody talks about it, but the weight that is lifted when the suffering, the anguish and the pain is lifted is cathartic.<br /><br />For a while we'll feel guilt at our ability (nay, our desire) to move on and live our lives. But after a while that too will fade, a little like the faces of the deceased as they dwindle into the distance like the last line of the star wars intro crawl floating off into space for ever more. Never to be seen again.... I very much hope....",1
6065,2.0,It had ups and downs but still so many plot holes. I so want to like it and when you are like OH DAMN! they throw in an unexplained mary sue happening and it makes me so sad. But the spund was epic and it had some chilling parts in it.,0
6066,5.0,"Not as bad as TLJ. Not as good as TFA. This one has some great moments, but is overstuffed and rushed. JJ Abrams did what he could after getting his original story murdered by Rian Johnson. I believe Snoke and Luke originally had larger roles for Ep 8&9, but we're basically written out in TLJ, which left this movie needing to reach for a villain and ending. Didnt love some choices for the end. Left feeling lukewarm (no pun intended), opposed to excited or disgusted like I did with Ep 7&8 respectively.",0

The variety of story there is beyond and far much better than what Disney conjured for this Trilogy...it basically all garbage and wasted potential.<br /><br />The magic of Star Wars is Jedi, Sith, the Force and Lightsaber but those are criminally underused and misused in this trilogy.<br /><br />This film is okay but cheesy and daft at time. It obvious that this film is to clean up the huge mess Rian Johnson has made with the last film - The Last Jedi.<br /><br />As with other reviews I have read, I agree bringing Palpatine back render the first six Star wars Films pointless.",0
6069,6.0,"To summarize this story in a few sentences, it's a basic video game plot from the early 2000s. ""Hey we need a macguffin, let's go get it."" Boss fight. ""Getting this macguffin made us realize we need an additional macguffin, let's go get it."" Boss fight.",0

6074,9.0,"I didnt read any reviews. Having happened upon a couple of headlines about this movie, I quickly got the impression there were plenty of sour man children who went home to sob under their Star Wars duvets because the movie didn't precisely go as they had spent the last two years fantasizing over... so I went with my 9 year old daughter and we were unsullied and expecting a roller coaster... and sweet jeebers, we got one.",1
6075,9.0,"I say this tongue in cheek, but part of me means it. Ep. VIII may have been controversial, but Rian Johnson had a clear idea where he was going and where he wanted to shift the focus (and message) of Star Wars. Not everything may have hit the mark but yes, the film kept me on my toes, I never knew what was coming next and I loved it. I go and watch a film to be surprised and see something I could not have imagined before. After IX I was left feeling flat. The film, apart from fantastic effects, great cinematography, music and sound effects, had no rhythm, no flow. The plot largely felt like bad fan fiction, busy and convoluted and I simply couldn't get emotionally invested. I love Rey and Daisy Ridley did give her best, but all the actors/characters would have deserved a better, more daring and surprising film. So yes, I absolutely want to see how Rian Johnson would have finished the story. I'm sure it would have been more memorable. Let's start crowdfunding :-)",1

Not the best... I still think that the three original ones and classic will be the best ones but... This movie is a close, and an ending... That's it.",1

6082,7.0,"JJ Abrams did his thing. After The Last Jedi, trash, and The force awakens, 'meh' at its best, I was ready to be disappointed but not surprised. However, I think the movie was actually pretty good.<br /><br />JJ sorta pulled a James Cameron where we can almost act the last 2 movies weren't even made, except for some brief mentions. If someone were to make a 5min video to introduce us to the cast, you could watch this immediately after ep.6 and to be honest, it would've been much better if they had shown us this movie in 2015.<br /><br />Of course the movies contains some Disney BS like horses on the side of a space ship, but there's a lot less forced humor than in the previous films.<br /><br />Kylo acts more like a Vader, Palpatine is pure evil again, and even though it's the end of the Skywalker saga, I'm sure there will be more movies in the future.",0
6083,8.0,"The movie definitely felt like it was trying to recover from what Johnson did the saga.

6085,9.0,"This movie felt so rushed. It built no suspense and did not allow you the opportunity to get attached to any of the characters. There was a lot going on in this movie but really nothing substantial or memorable. There's a very weird ""off"" feeling to it the whole time, like they cut and pasted a bunch of random characters and moments together. I really liked Rey's and Kylo's characters but sadly they weren't used properly and this was the worst film of the three in my opinion. If you follow the movies, I'd still watch it for closure and judge for yourself.",0

The audio and visuals were phenomenal throughout this action packed film from start to finish. It was a fun ride and a great conclusion to the 9 movie saga. Well done J.J. Abrams and team!",1
6088,9.0,SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Just came back from the midnight premiere of star wars episode 9.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest I dunno wherever to laugh or cry it was so bad.<br /><br />It was a train reck right from the start<br /><br />When you read the opening crawl you know theirs a problem the fact they mention palpatine is litterly back from the dead without and explanation of how he survived. The film is litterly all over the place.<br /><br />Then theirs the twist when they mentioned the twist i just thought thatsbdisney for u. Palpatine is Rey's grandad thats right people the most evil man in the universe is the grandfather of Rey without any explanation how that was even possible. Then theirs the famous jesus moment the most weakest villain in all the star wars films gets mortally wounded then rey basically brings him back to life that's right people.<br /><br />Honestly theirs so much bad stuff in this film.<br /><br />George lucas got a lot of stick for the prequels but the one thing to give him credit for he new where the story was going who was going to ultimately suffer. Disney dont have a clue where to take the star wars story. My advise to them in terms of star wars movie just leave it alone.<br /><br />Damn what a train reck.,0
6089,,This film is amazing. No one else could of pulled off this film but JJ. I am sooo satisfied and happy. It isn't flawless but it is seriously a contender of being my favorite Star Wars right under Return of The Jedi. Thank you for an Amazing experience. My whole family loved it.,1

6091,1.0,"Given the previous film it took me a long long time to drum up the enthusiasm to watch this film. Only a short and rather out of place Luke Skywalker appearance produced any thoughts of redemption. Despite a number of reboots nothing has ever come close to the original saga. This makes it tough perhaps to be objective for a fan of the original and given how Starwars changed sci-fi movies for ever, unrealistic to expect a movie experience in the same way.",1

6093,1.0,I really can't understand what's going on with the critics. They rave about the last Jedi. That was possibly the worst movie I have wasted money on at a cinema and really actually upset me as an original trilogy fan. Now they give poor to mixed reviews for the rise of Skywalker. I actually went into this thinking the bad reviews may be a good sign. And they were. So much better than the last movie and I think better than the force awakens. What was good. The atmosphere. That thing it's hard to capture and bottle. Oscar Issac was way better in this movie than before. I enjoyed Ian McDiarmid once again. The humour worked well and C3PO was actually given something to do again. Look judge for yourself. For me as a fan of the original movies I felt this was a good effort. I got a similar feeling with rogue one. Not perfect but pretty good. They overplayed the battle scene. Bigger is not always better. But hey. All in all I enjoyed Star Wars again. Thanks JJ.,0
6094,8.0,"I loved 4,5 & 6. I didn't mind 1,2 & 3. I loved 7 and didn't mind 8. I hated this pile of crap. After 10 minutes I was looking at my watch hoping it was time to leave. I was so excited to go and see it.",1
6095,4.0,"Had a lot of potential, but it feels like The Last Jedi ruined this film. They tried to put band-aid on it, but the wound was too large. The directing was horrible, scenes kept jumping too fast. Acting was mixed, had good moments, and bad. Felt like the comedy was forced. The story was terrible, only had one basic plot (fan films, and even the Christmas special had better stories). When I walked out of the theater, I kept hearing people crap on the film, most of them shared the same feelings. There was one scene that got everyone clapping, the rest was laughter for all the wrong reasons. In conclusion, just watch The Mandalorian, or Episodes I-VI instead.",0

6099,9.0,"People are complaining about this movie before it was even released. In my opinion there was no other way this 9 movie saga was going to end.

6100,10.0,Simply fantastic. What a way to end the Saga. This film has everything you could want and does indeed tie together all of the Skywalker films as promised. I am a fan of 40 years and fully appreciate what a challenge such a new trilogy is. JJ pulled it off in a mega way. You could ask for nothing more (apart from a few more force ghosts). Simply stunning filmmaking and storytelling with treasures for die hard fans Luke myself. Seen twice in first 24 hours and will see many more times.,1
6101,10.0,Star Wars Episode IX<br /><br />Story is boring for people who have wished star wars being made into light saber fights and character development. Don't expect anything and watch the film because even if your a star wars fan go watch for the wait for all those 8 films you have sat and loved.<br /><br />Appreciate the old trilogy and the prequels because to be honest it was much better then the new trilogy.,0

6103,10.0,"I wanted to live this so much, and there are some parts that I absolutely adored! But there were some things that really annoyed, upset and disappointed me too. I didn't leave fully satisfied or even majority satisfied and I had a LOT of questions. I know some will be answered in comic books, novelisations, future novels etc but overall it's not how I'd have ended the saga.<br /><br />The pacing of the first half was slow and the jump cuts fast which made it feel very disjointed. It wasn't cohesive to start with. I felt some relationships weren't mined to their full potential. Lots of missed opportunities. The score was phenomenal though, some of the cast performances exceptional (Adam Driver especially) and I loved pretty much all of the new characters. I just don't feel like the ending was as satisfying or hopeful as it was advertised as by cast and crew!",1
6104,6.0,Thank you JJ Abrams. You were pushed into the corner by the last jedi which was a terrible film.,0
6105,9.0,Episode 9 is unbearable. It's frustrating to see one of your favorite childhood fantasies ruined.,1

6107,10.0,It was good. All these folks saying it's bad and had no plot probably had their minds made up already that it was gonna suck. Not the greatest movie out there but it was definitely entertaining for the whole family.,1
6108,8.0,The way Tiramisù is one of those things that people have thought about differently since 1993.,1
6109,9.0,"Don't listen to the bad reviews it's the anger from the Disney betrayal of the first 2 blinding them, If you've experienced any of the old cannon (books, comics, games) you will notice many nods to It, I went into the cinema not expecting much. I left wanting more. It felt like Star Wars again. Adam driver was great I'm so glad he finally pulled off kylo/Ben solo, Force healing, force draining, the powers in this are great. Leia is a jedi the flash back to Luke and leia was amazing it where the new trilogy should have started years ago. When the dust settles this will be up there as one of the best. I want more",1
6110,10.0,"JJ in my opinion did a great job in fixing a lot of issues with ep 8, finishing ep 9 and the sequel trilogy. Sure the movie isn't perfect but it's not the worst Star Wars movie ever. I would've done some things differently but over a good movie.",1
6111,7.0,"A trilogy made 20 years to late, if you wanted Han Luke Leia out saving the universe, then read Thawn trilogy which should have been made into movies.<br /><br />This film the end of an average trilogy was entertaining but a bit of a mess, rushing from one planet..fight...to another...fight, etc didn't let the audience breath.<br /><br />Few good moments. One scene when Ray was given extra force powers, could have been backed up by fighting force ghosts behind her, Luke Anakin Yoda etc that would have been cool, but every opportunity of seeing saga hero's was messed up or missed.<br /><br />Good job I'm open minded JJ or this film would have scored a 3.",0
6112,6.0,So who resurrected Palpatine? They can just resurrect him again! Rey has every jedi of the past in her but she dies by blocking the dark force. huh? Then Kylo resurrects Rey then immediately disappears but Luke couldn't even save his father or Obi wan. What was Rey and Kylo's kiss about it was very strange and meaningless. Finn never tells Rey what he wanted even though the series put on that they had some sort of romantic connection. Wow!,0

6114,10.0,"Fast, action packed, well acted and expertly directed family favourite. A brilliantly told story of good vs evil, inner battles, redemption and sacrifice. Superb",1
6115,10.0,"The Rise Of Skywalker honestly felt like there were three movies packed in one. I'll give it to them, I liked the way they protested palpatine as the mastermind and ""inventor"" of snoke but then again everything felt too abrupt. Giving such a huge and memorable franchise a mediocre ending can only be a by product of disney. The force awakens was a marvelous come back for the franchise but this last movie just doesn't hit that spot. I feel like the people giving the movie a 1 or 2/10 are being quite melodramatic, episode 9 had it's strong points, for example, princess Leia's demise was shown in an accurate and memorable scene during Ray and Kylo's fight sequence. But scenes such as Chewbacca still being alive are a means of pretentious surprises that are unlike this franchise (except for episode 2). Overall Rise Of Skywalker was a disappointing bombardment of too much plot in too little time, packed with unnecessary additions to the story it stands as my second least favorite star wars movie in between episode 1 and 2. But do see this, the movie is definitely worth a watch but make sure not to sport over excitement as you may have for the past star wars movies or you'll be victim to a plague of disappointment!",1
6116,5.0,"JJ saved the sequels. Not in the best possible way, but you can't fix what's been broken that much (yes, TLJ, i'm watching at you).<br /><br />If i had to end those really problematic tangling stories that were left by the episode 8, i would even resurrect Darth Maul for that. OH WAIT.<br /><br />JJ even handled to put way less unnecessary gags in there, no green milk or chibi plush creatures.<br /><br />BIG KUDOS for all the effort.",0

Act 3 was pretty good but overall what made me like the movie was act 2 and act 3 I really enjoyed this acts but hey that's what happens when people wanna complain about the last Jedi and didn't let Rian Johnson work his magic",1
6119,8.0,"My initial reaction was not good. I was upset by how the potentially great movie was ruined by bad execution and meaningless first half. The pacing made it impossible to feel anything or process anything before moving on to the next scene. So I felt really cheated of the emotional scenes that should of but didn't land.<br /><br />But after seeing it again and taking the time to process it, I've come to appreciate it a lot more. Given the toxic fandom he had to work with, and studio up his back I think he did the best he could. We need to remember what it's like to see the originals. Go in with a sense of wonder and let the story unfold and let them tell us the story. Not go in intending to nit pick every detail. Allow yourself to enjoy the story that unfolds before you. That is why you remember the originals as so great. You allowed the story to be told. You allowed yourself to enjoy it.<br /><br />That is why there is such a disparity in fandom. The younger generation love these movies because they are watching it the same way you watched the originals. Allowing them to tell us the story not vice versus.<br /><br />I don't want to be part of the fandom that chooses to find the worse and complain about it and choose to hate it. When I let go of my own expectations and watched it from a new perspective then I really loved what JJ was able to do. The ben arc was better then anything I could up with and it was beautifully written. I have racked my brain since TFA on how in the world could they pull off a redemption that we would buy and I honestly couldn't think of anything myself. And this was beautiful. For those last moments alone gave me enough movie magic feels to make me now love this movie. Execution could of been better but they gave me the story. And It's the story that'll stand the rest of time not the techniqualities. So I changed my rating from 4 to an 8",1

How many times will the Palpatine lose from his own lightning?? Do we really not have any other ideas?? Kylo was evolving as a character for 3 movies so he would get to Rey, get his life force sucked, dropped of a cliff, come back up, ressurect Rey, and die.. Oh and kiss her(???). And then Rey BECOMES a Skywalker. With a grey Jedi lightsaber. Why not make Kylo and Rey fight TOGETHER, win, and maybe kill Rey in the process??",0

I understand there are complaints about the last Jedi but a majority of them do not bother me as much as other fans, as a fan of movies first, and star wars second, i found this a refreshing blockbuster that tried to steer away from what we had come to expect from a star wars way while evolving the characters in an extremely interesting way",0

It has a lower Rotten Tomatoes score than Attack of The Clones (which, in a handy Sebulba phrase, was in fact Poodoo)! This is an outrage, in my humble opinion, as it really did feel like the grand end that the Skywalker Saga deserves, and packed more than enough space battles, punch-the-air moments and, most of all, emotional moments for long-time fans to cry about, to sit proudly beside it's predecessors as one of the great Star Wars film. Anyone who doesn't feel a lump in the throat as the final twin-sunset dawns on the place it all started, Tatooine, and John Williams' still-fantastic score kicks in, may well be a droid. It's also the second film of the saga where Palpatine says ""Do it!"" :) This film definitely left lots of positive ripples in the Force. A+++",1

I disliked the first one and really hated the second, and if not for my husband- would pass this one. However, though it's not a masterpiece, it was actually a nice movie. It has some kind of a plot, and even some authentic ideas. It's logical (compared to the two previous abominations). It's well made, with good music and visuals, and good acting. And no Death Stars explode in it- a huge bonus! It has no world building or politics, and does not really feel like Star Wars- but still-it's actually enjoyable.",1
6150,7.0,"Coming up to this movie I did not want to go in with any preconceived ideas about the film. I tend to try to watch a film to enjoy it, learn from it and to be taken away by it. So to do that I made sure to not know anything, no trailers, no interviews, no casting list or disposition. I wanted to watch the film as it is and enjoy it based only on what has already been established in previous films in the trilogy. Now, with that being said... I found Star Wars IX: - The Rise of Skywalker to not only be a bad finally of the trilogy from a story perspective but also a badly made film as a whole. Why? From a movie standpoint I found the structure and pacing of the film to be majorly flawed as it failed to organize itself. To enjoy a film you need to let it take you on its journey and to be able to do that it needs to let you do it. As many have already said in their own reviews, it takes about 30 minutes to get into what is happening and get some sort of grip of the situation and that is just because so much is happening. A lot more than necessary. In the first 15 min, we get to see, meet and discover more new places, scenarios and characters in quick succession and it is hard to ""get on the ride"" and you are instead dispelled from the whole experience. The insensible shift from fast and eventful to slow and emotional is so back and forth throughout the film so if you manage to start to get into it, you are shortly thrown off again which only makes it a hassle to watch. This is despite the fact that you are measly aware that there is a conflict between good and evil at play and who belong to which team. However, despite this you don't get the opportunity to get a feel of were these characters really are in that war and you are taken aback at certain moments because of this. The reason why I found this to be the case is simply do to the directors and screenwriters attempting to cram as much as possible into the film which then turned out to be an impossible task. The shoddy dialog doesn't help either, with characters constantly handing out flat punchlines and old references which in the moment only makes them seem disconnected to what is Infront of them and you are once again thrown of the horse. The movie also doesn't seem to follow a cohesive logic as it also shift back and forth between what kind of theme it wants to establish, is it a conflict of morals? A classic fight between good and evil? A character journey? An adventure? A successor story? A great film would manage to have all of these things going for it at the same time, don't get me wrong, but there are too many elements which muddies the water which then makes you ask yourself... was that even worth having in the film? The answer to that question is more often than not... no... it should have been slimed down or played a more discreet role in service of something more defining. The only redeeming thing about the film is that it gave answers to many questions which you wanted to get an answer to but those questions mostly appeared in the previous two films which again perhaps would have been better served to be answered more appropriately then and there. Something you also need to think about is who is the movie for? And that is something the movie also doesn't seem to know. Is It for new fans? Old fans? Regular movie lovers? Or all of them? In any case I believe the movie is best suited for those who are only interested in the visual and a surface level experience and to those people I'd say you'll definitely say that it is enjoyable but not rewarding. You will not take this movie with you and probably not want to watch it again and that to me says more than enough of the quality of the film and the trilogy as a whole.",0

Moon Duo's new songs are worthy. And please- No more jabbas , or sam I jackson, but cameos with Gandfalf and Beorn and those eagles in space would be awesome. A story line about Yoda ending up for spare change or maybe ending up at a bantha rodeo at the Yoda- on -a -stick concession.

6166,9.0,"""The Force"" in Star Wars saga has always been used in service of the story. They overused it in this movie introducing powers that they should have never even touched! Force healing ? Anakin turned to the dark side for that and ray can do it without hesitation. BS",1

6168,1.0,"You dont need me to point out the flaws of the trilogy they are well documented and plain to see. But if you are judging this film on its own merits then, as with The Last Jedi i don't see the argument for it being a poor film. Yes some of the narrative choices are bizzare in the context of the trilogy as a whole, but once you get past that like me you can appreciate the awesome set pieces and worthy conclusions for two of the sagas best characters in Rey and Ren. The final battle feels slightly hurried, buts delivers some big emotional beats whilst the final scene is (as a life long SW fan) everything i would have wanted.",1
6169,5.0,"This movie was far better than I expected, especially after reading initial critic reviews. The movie isn't perfect but Star Wars has never been about sublime narrative or great acting. It's been about fun plots, homage to the past movies of the series Andy the genre that inspired them, the relationships among the characters, and a present day morality tale. This movie tied up the numerous threads hanging after the eighth movie and it created, to me, a very satisfying ending to the nine movie arc that started when I was 10 years old. I'll miss the sequencing of the next chapters to my life but liked very much the way this movie created seen ending.",1
6170,9.0,"In Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Rey and her band of rebels have to find the thing to find the thing that will show them how to get to the thing. This is basically the cinematic equivalent of a ten-million-dollar supercar but under the hood all you'll find is a rusty lawnmower engine with a clogged spark plug and a busted fuel line. The writing is so abysmal that it defies belief. Convenience and dumb luck rule the day, and anything consequential that happens later turns out to be completely inconsequential. Abrams leaves the audience with no time for thinking, and by moving everything along at close to the speed of light, he is desperately hoping the audience won't even try to as they're relentlessly assaulted with a delectable mix of action, idiocy, and nostalgia. As far as Abrams' directorial talents go, it's highly likely that a ten-year old playing with his Star Wars toys could come up with something far more engaging that this glorious dumpster fire that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make. It's so bad it's actually kind of fascinating, and I'm not even gonna get into the whole shoehorning of Emperor Palpatine into the plot solely to give Kylo Ren's get-out-of-jail-free-card after having elevated himself to central antagonist The Last Jedi. At the end of the day, just about the only positive I can think of when it comes to The Rise of Skywalker, is that it's the last film in the new trilogy, meaning I won't have to subject myself to yet another Star Wars film courtesy of this so-called creative team. Thank God for small mercies.",0

Some people will really enjoy it, when there's big explosions and characters running from scene to scene, from world to world, with barely a chance to catch breath.

I had been able to avoid watching any spoilers before the movie so I didn't know anything about it, other than short glimpses of the official trailer. I saw some news that people were hating the movie. That didn't discourage me much, because I trusted it will be great and I wanted to enjoy it for the price of the movie ticket (15 euros). I was able to walk into the movie theater with empty mind without much expectation, with great excitement about ending of Star Wars saga.",1
6174,7.0,"So many things I liked about this movie. But just didn't work as a whole. The film plays out like cool episodes of a tv series strung together into a 2.5 hour compilation of fan service and cool looking set pieces. Yet somehow it just doesn't fit together into a satisfying cohesive ending. Lando was overplayed, he should have bowed out after his first scene and been left as a cool cameo. So much of the film was designed and written to give the finger to The Last Jedi that it distracts the audience.<br /><br />The final battle, the one that finishes 40 years of story was beat for beat the end battle from Endgame. But where the portals sequence stirred so many emotions, the arrival of all the alliance ships felt hollow there was no ""on your left"" or ""Avengers assemble"" moment that struck the right satisfying chord.<br /><br />It's not terrible, it's just not that great.",1

6177,10.0,"Went to a midnight showing in the UK with my dad and brother - a man who grew up with the original trilogy, a boy who's grown up with the sequels, while I grew up with the prequels. All 3 of us left with smiles on our faces, talked praise non stop for the entire journey home and all said that our initial impression puts it as the best film in the sequel trilogy. The film does have sections of clunky dialogue and some section did feel rushed or just weren't needed, but this film was 2 hours 20 minutes of satisfaction and fun. No spoilers, but the Rey, Finn, Poe and Chewie quest was on the whole great, I really enjoyed the main lightsaber fight on Kef Bir and the Emperor was a proper baddy and has been a puppeteer of all 9 films . I also really liked the push and pull narrative between Rey and Kylo, toying with the light, the dark and a bit in between. They answered a whole bunch of questions brought up in TFA and TLJ that weren't answered and had numerous callbacks to all previous 8 films, which were fun to spot and brought a smile to your face. I can guarantee some answers will leave some people reeling in their seats and wanting to throw something, but that's just how some people are with Star Wars. Overall I loved the film, I'm seeing it again today and for the third time tomorrow and I'll be recommending it to everyone I can. The Star Wars fandom will always be divided, especially with Disney, claiming lack of imagination and risk with the directors and script writing, but you can tell JJ is a huge Star Wars fan. It may not be anywhere close to Empire Strikes Back or Rogue One for cinematic story telling or character development, but it's a great film you NEED to watch to make your own mind up on!",1

I went to The Rise of Skywalker for someone else and expected this to just be awful too. I've been a fan since 1977. I felt no connection to the characters walking into this, no interest in the story of this trilogy anymore, and was ready for Star Wars to end for me with The Return of the Jedi, have Rogue One before A New Hope, and The Force Awakens as potential fanfic.",0
6180,8.0,"I enjoyed the movie a lot but I enjoyed the reactions of the fans a lot more :) I liked the movie even though there were some things that could be left out - e.g. Ben kissing Rey, that didn't feel right, the connection between them wasn't romantic. Some people in the cinema put down the 3D glasses like they couldn't believe what's going on. I didn't understand why they returned Palpatine on screen and how could be Rey his grandchild! It seems that they couldn't find a better villain for the last episode so they tried Palpatine. The end is not so disappointing as in the GoT. There was humor, action, great music, so I think it's worth to watch it.",1

6184,9.0,"Growing up with Star Wars, this saga has always had a special place in my heart.<br /><br />This was a wonderful and truly fitting end to the saga.<br /><br />I doubt if anyone could have done a better job.<br /><br />As for all of the 'armchair' critics in this forum, and I mean every single one of them, when they can evidence that they have the artistic and technical capability to have done better, then and only then is their opinion worth considering. From what professional standpoint (in the arts) do they justify their criticism? (whether they liked it or no is another matter).<br /><br />My heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in the creation of this film to finally giving the story the send off it deserved. Wonderful!",1
6185,10.0,"Just let the franchise die here... uninteresting, irrelevant, unnecessary and not entertaining at all... I found myself trying to make sense of all the nonsense this movie tried to pack in its runtime...<br /><br />This movie felt like a tantrum by JJ to Rian for doing something different.",0
6186,4.0,"It's a movie that, like the ones before him, has a lot of unused potentials, a lot of characters could have had a story arc that made an impact on the story. For example, Fin is introduced as a stormtrooper that betrays the empire, but at the end of this trilogy, you still don't feel the impact of that event. Like fin, there are many others, Snoke that on the first movie left everyone intrigued, was quickly thrown away and never had a real impact; captain phasma and that shiny armor suffered the same fate and we never really got to know her. The newly added characters follow the same problem, they don't feel impactful in the storyline and most of all, they don't create a personal connection with the audience.<br /><br />However the film, in my opinion, has a solid first half. The comedy was in general, not just in the first half but the hole movie, well balanced and enjoyable, not like in the Last Jedi; I believe, the Han Solo and Kylo Ren dialogue, was very well written and can create a nostalgic, emotional moment. Adam driver, as all the actors, delivers great performance for one of the best characters of this trilogy. The saber fights are decent and so are the special effects.<br /><br />For the third and final act, things go sideways. The sense of danger for the return of Palpatine never gets to its real climax, so wen the all fight starts you dont feel the sense of danger. To be honest, when the final act starts you can very easily predict the end, its cliche, poorly written and rushed.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent movie that cant, yet again, follow the steps of the original star wars but still, despite the horrible ending, the lack of a good scrip, and a ton of lost potencial, was able to create some emotional moments that made me smile.",1

6194,9.0,"Disney bought Star Wars from George Lucas, I personally think that doing that has let down star wars fans from around the world.<br /><br />Disney bought Lucasfilm because they new they would make an incredible amount of money for any more films related to Lucasfilm.<br /><br />Disney didn't really care about the script they had written for this movie. The acting really wasn't good.<br /><br />And when chewie was captured, and his ship blew up (because Rey had Emperor Palpatine's Powers), it was later revealed that there where actually two ships and chewie wasn't on the one that blew up. It's stupid! There was clearly on the ship that blew up, we saw him get in!<br /><br />And Disney just don't understand how the force works, you CAN HEAL PEOPLE WITH THE FORCE? And you can use the force to bring people back to life? Disney has been so used to remaking animated films into live action films, that their ability to write some sequels with new ideas has taken a turn for the worst. Disney has been so used to making fairy-tale movies, it should be more like - ""May the Magic be With You"" because it really is magic. The lightsaber battles are poorly choreographed and around the middle of the movie it is revealed that Emperor Palpatine is actaully alive? In Return of The Jedi, Darth Vader threw Emperor Palpatine into the big hole on the Death Star II. You could see a big flash afterwards, probably him blowing up or being killed. Nobody could survive that. And then Lando Calrissian destroyed the Death Star II, and it very clearly blew up killing everybody inside of it. Yet many years later, Emperor Palpatine is actually alive, he survived the fall, and the massive explosion at the end of the movie. What is up with that??<br /><br />If you have read up to the end of the review, thank you for your time, If you haven't seen the movie I don't recommend it.

It is a great installment and conclusion to the Skywalker saga. -1 Star for no Anakin. The sith and their loyalists/cultists were awesome. Exegol was epic but wished they showed us more of it along with the Sith mythology. Introduces us to new mythology/understanding of the sith - the whole sith rule of two was a trick/con of epic proportions by I presume Darth Bane??!! The master could live on thru the apprentice, not vice versa as we have been led to believe till now. Makes sense now why Palpatine groomed Anakin, taunted Luke to strike him down - so he could pass on his spirit/essence to a younger person and ""cheat death""? I wonder if Palpatine has been Darth bane this whole time?? I hope they do continue the Skywalker saga in the future with episodes 10-12- . Long live the Skywalkers!

That said when I found out that they are making another trilogy I was extremely excited to see what will happen with the characters I grew up loving.<br /><br />The Force Awakens is a fantastic continuation of the original trilogy. It had everything a Star Wars movie should have. It had Heart, humor, and it gave the fans something to look forward to. I remember seeing it in theaters and loving every second of it. Then after I saw it once I of course saw it 3 more times in theaters.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same for The Last Jedi. It was received well by critics when it first came out, but fans were devastated, as was I.<br /><br />With the Rise of Skywalker, it has the heart and soul of Star Wars. After The last Jedi I was worried that this movie would suffer from its mistakes, but I can tell you with a smile on my face that it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />It may feel rushed, but it's understandable considering how little The Last Jedi brought to the table.<br /><br />For fellow fans of this universe.

When George Lucas was banished from Star Wars I thought at the very least we would be spared another ""make it up as we go along"" story a la prequel trilogy. Alas it was actually worse. We got the most pointless movie of the most pointless trilogy in the history of cinema. An exceptional failure of titanic proportions . This one had it all. A lazy empty headed script. A flimsy convoluted story with preposterous character motivations. Flat, boring , annoying characters. The originality of a volcano project at a science fair. A complex weave of horrendous flaws all being perpetuated by Disney itself. Why was JJ Abrams not under contract to direct all three films? Why weren't the writers made to create a script of all three films initially to ensure continuity? An absolute sham. Shame on you Disney and George Lucas and JJ Abrams for putting out such a blatant money grab and shame on the herds of fans that blindly pump this generic movie making machine with all of the fuel it will ever need. I could keep going but like most involved with this crime I ran out of caring.",0
6206,2.0,"In a way you can't blame JJ Abrams for the mediocrity of Rise Of Skywalker. It felt like the first half of the film was JJ Putting bandaids on scenes and moments that happened in TLJ. At times it was subtle, and others<br /><br />It was in your face so much, add in the throwbacks to everything Star Wars every 5 minutes that the film lacks an actual understandable storyline and character development.<br /><br />Whole scenes could have been majorly cut down, I.e- C3po and the erasing of the memory sub plot that carried on too long, but of course they had that all in there so that the sub characters can have something to do. I had flashbacks of Rose and Finn in TLJ with that.<br /><br />Adam Driver did a good job with a limited role he had in my opinion. Rey was awesome at everything she did of course, and that cringe scene of her pulling the ship<br /><br />Down with the force was a totaL mess.<br /><br />A lot of the film had so many scenes that you're meant to feel like ""oh no they didn't just kill that character did they?"", nah they didn't because 2-3 minutes later we find out they are fine and alive. Their was no sense of danger to any of the key characters once this effect is done once twice.<br /><br />As it goes on we are given so much exposition that I felt I was in a class room and listening to someone explain every damn detail of what was happening . Again, these scenes take you out of being engaged in the movie. Let's not get into the ending with the emperor and Reys lineage, it's blatantly obvious that Disney had no clue where to go and thus, our protagonist is of course related to someone from the original films, and then we have a carbon copy of the end of ROTJ with Rey, Ren and the Emperor .<br /><br />They say imitation is the first form of flattery, in this sequel trilogy and in this film, it's actually ridiculous and shows no creative flair when they were trying to end the saga but all they ended up doing was rehash everything old.<br /><br />The film is bad per se, and I think a 6/10 is what it deserves. The cinematography /soundtrack and acting work well, it's just a shame how so many flaws in the narrative totally miss the mark. It's better than TLJ but not as good as TFA . Watching this is making me appreciate the original 6 films a lot more.<br /><br />The rise of skywalker will please some but tbh, it's a sad ending to an iconic story.",0

Therefore there is only one possible satisfactory remedy, get the devoted fans to submit plots and storylines and then vote democratically over years to form the most acceptable outcome.

BB8 restored. I loved D-0's symbolic wounded child/survivor-of-abuse F-U reference to the B.S. of TLJ. The human characters were given their dignity back as well.

6225,10.0,Sorry about all the die hard Star Wars fans who can pick at all the flaws in the story lines. I was thoroughly entertained and cheered at the end.,0
6226,9.0,"I will make this one spoiler free, but honestly it only gets 3 Star because it is two star better than the previous two movies. Abrams did a good job with it with the sound and visual, but the story just truly killed the whole movie world which Lucas started. I advise you to actually wait for a DVD version, and torrent it, so you do not give Disney any more money for this failure really. Yeah I know this one is illegal but it should be illegal too, to actually ruin the world of Star Wars with this trilogy.",0
6227,3.0,"In a world where fans have made it clear they dont want expectations diverted the Rise of Skywalker was born, having very little surprises and retconning the unpopular bits of the last movie while maintaining a good original plot and character arcs.",1
6228,8.0,"If you don't live under a rock then you are aware and see all of the recent backlash and negative reviews for this movie. What baffles me is where was all this negativity when TLJ came out? In my opinion RoS is the best of the sequels. Sure there are plot holes and stories left unanswered but mainly only because of the mess TLJ has created. If JJ had the time to sit down with Lucas and actually fully plan these three movies out and was given more time I truly believe these could have surpassed the prequels. You have to understand Disney really messed with Lucasfilms and Star Wars in general. These films were rushed and handled poorly. BUT BUT BUT! JJ fully recovered from the disaster we seen in 2017 from the dark lord Rian Johnson. Writing was improved, I hated Poe and Finn in the last two movies and this movie I believe redeemed those characters. While Rey and Kylo Absolutely stole the show. Every seen with Kylo was so memorable and will be imprinted into your heads for ever. JJ made the best of a bad situation and that is sadly what we have to accept with this movie. I'm not gonna go into the movie so much because of all the spoilers. Who knows, the prequels got here doin reviews when they came out and now they are being praised by all. Give it some time. Let Star Wars rest a bit, the way this was left off I really believe We can have a new trilogy in the Future. We need Fioloni from clone wars and Deborah Chow from mandalorian to take over fully for lucasfilms. We have the Obi-Wan show to look forward to and the finale for mandalorian. Don't blame JJ for this, go in open minded like I did and truly Understand the situation this movie was in before reviewing it. May the Force be with you always",1
6229,,"The movie has the best storytelling an can makes you laugh, cry and can shock you . If has lots of surprises an of course answers.<br /><br />And know this critics say nothing but nonsense",1
6230,10.0,"Unfortunately it is so hard to do anything at this point after The Last Jedi decided to ruin the initial vision of this. I feel like overall the movie does try to correct as much as it can, but it's basically trying to put a bandaid on a gun wound.",0
6231,6.0,"The reviews of this movie are per typical of Star Wars fan entitlement. The movie didn't go the direction you wanted it to so you're irritated and you rate it a 1-star. Really? This is among the worst movies you've ever seen? Extremely unlikely. Calm down. I've seen this movie twice now and it was definitely better the second time where you have more of a chance to take things in. I thought this movie was fun, interesting, full of twists, and great acting. I don't think J.J. Abrams ran course correction of The Last Jedi as many people are assuming. You really think Disney writes and plans the story arc one movie at a time? Come on now.",1
6232,9.0,"Very very disappointing. The trilogy and the last story are complete non-sense, rubbish. Disney should have left G.Lucas had the director, we would would probably had the same thrill has the first trilogy.<br /><br />Depsite having good actors & nice CGI, this last episode is a complete failure, tasteless, not worth of being rewatched.<br /><br />At least the Mandolarian is saving the Star Wars business and worth to watch.",0
6233,4.0,Such a fitting end to the story I grew up with. Plenty of tears for sure.,1
6234,10.0,"If you are old enough to remember going to see one of the original trilogy movies after waiting in what seemed like lines that spanned for miles, you're probably old enough now that you have children of your own that are about the same age as you when you first experienced Star Wars on the big screen. I took my daughter to see this movie as her first big screen Star Wars experience. When I saw the look of amazement and wonder on her face that reminded me of mine, I knew Star Wars franchise gained a new fan. The conservative viewers will never be satisfied because nothing will compare to their childhood experience. The more open minded viewer will see this movie for what it is. Entertainment. Action sequences were great, special effects were great, costumes were great. The story was about the ending of the original Skywalker Saga and beginning a new one.<br /><br />Of course there will never be as epic a reveal as the ""I am your father"" in any movie ever. To measure any recent or future reveals or surprises to the Vader-Luke surprise is by default, a set up to dissapointment.<br /><br />As my daughter walked out of the theater asking when we can see it again, I saw that the director and producers accomplished what they set out to do. Make a new fan, and make this old fan a happy and proud father.",1

6237,10.0,Why did you have to kill kylo?? this movie was a heartbreak.,0
6238,5.0,"OK, I am not a HUGE Star Wars fan but I am one of those guys who LOVE the Empire Strikes back and the Last Jedi (yes, I actually loved the Last Jedi).<br /><br />So I knew this was going to disappoint the moment I stepped into the theater.",1
6239,5.0,JJ attempted to please everyone and clean up last Jedi critics ( which I enjoyed and think is another great film with flaws) . He achieved that but I think the damage to overall storyline was done in last Jedi I love it as stand alone story but between that Carrie Fisher not able to continue it left very difficult situation. It was impossible task.,1
6240,8.0,"Man oh man! What an adventure this movie was. I may not have enjoyed The Last Jedi as much, but The Rise of Skywalker really nails it as a perfect ending to the Skywalker saga. It's emotional, thrilling, and just absolutely amazing. Though I will say beginning felt kinda rushed, but it picked up towards the second act. Brilliant!",1
6241,8.0,"Many plot holes, to many characters to follow, it was just a okay movie. There wasn't anything special about it",0
6242,5.0,Overall a very satisfying film. A few unnecessary diversions but plenty to like about this film. Especially the acting of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Yes you have to accept some fanciful character resurrections but sit back and just enjoy.,1
6243,8.0,Worst star wars movie so far and I thought Star wars 7 was bad!,0
6244,5.0,Do not listen to critics this film is for the fans and its absolutely beautiful and a super conclusion to the Sega. Thanks you JJ,1
6245,10.0,"The movie is great! Lots of fun! We should all be happy that over 40+ years, we have all the wonderful Star Wars world that has been created for us on many different formats! Everyone is such a hater and critic now days! I suggest that YOU go out and make a Star Wars movie, if you think things need to be better! Lets see what happens!!",1
6246,10.0,"I'll be the first to admit, I was very biased going into Disney's new era of Starwars. I had been a longtime fan, and was hesitant. Force Awakens fell flat, TLJ was a failure. But this one tied all the plot holes and made a great fun of it.",1
6247,3.0,Let me start off by saying that if you like the last Jedi you won't like this movie! Pretty much everything that the last jedi brought to the saga was trashed. To me that was a good thing cause Rian Johnson may have had a good idea to be different but his ideas just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie at all! JJ Abrams just a lot of fan service in the movie and answers a lot of questions! Overall I think this movie is great and it may not be the best because of how fast paced it is but it sure makes up for how crappy I feel the last Jedi is!,1
6248,7.0,NON-SPOILER REVIEW/THOUGHTS:<br /><br />* Overall rating 1.5/4 stars (or with IMDB system of 10 stars: 3.75/10 stars),1
6249,3.0,Nice twists. Most of the reviewers are idiots. Watch it on Dolby Cinema if you have it at your theatre. Better sound experience than End Game.,1
6250,9.0,"I totally understand how die hard fans were a let down. I'm a pretty big fan and I thought some of the ""big reveal"" was underwhelming. At times I felt like it was being told by my drunk uncle who kept back tracking and saying ""Oh yeah, i forgot to tell you this character did that earlier"". However, people giving it one or two stars, was it REALLY the worst movie you've ever seen, or were you just disappointed that an ending 42 years in the making wasnt perfect?? Its fun to watch. YES it's a bit Disney and the formula is the same as the past but it didnt drag! I wish I could rave about it but I CAN say it's worth the price of admission.",0
6251,8.0,"I think Rise of Skywalker was an excellent film! We finally see the conclusion of Rey's story. I don't understand the negativity this film has gotten. The way I see it is you have to treat each trilogy separate. Even though this movie is the ending of the nine films, set aside it wraps up its own trilogy. That's a hard task to do and I think it did just fine. The cast is what makes this film really hit home. Characters of new and old come together to end one of the best film franchises hollywood has had to offer. The return of Palpatine I feel was a necessity to wrap the nine movies together. Abrams did a fantastic job despite Episode 8 undoing a lot of ground work he had setup in Episode 7. I love Star Wars & loved this movie. Enjoy it folks. Really, just enjoy it. It's the final piece of the Jedi Saga!",1
6252,8.0,"I grew up with the original trilogy and I'd consider myself to be a lifelong Star Wars fan. I think the biggest mistake with this new trilogy is the lack of a consistent path/direction where they saw this series going and the disrespect they give by undermining the entire story of the OT.<br /><br />Visually stunning but it feels like a facsimile of a Star Wars film. I imagine a group of people who aren't fans getting together and deciding what they think people want to see or what they think goes into it but completely missing the point.<br /><br />Daisy Ridley's character is just awful, completely overpowered and a poor actress, her range seems to be gritting her teeth and snarling in every situation despite being some godlike Jedi who isn't supposed to give in to anger. Just very disappointing.",0
6253,2.0,"It's like a sandwitch with way too much stuff in it. And it's not like the ""stuff"" is too good either.<br /><br />Looks good visually but bite in deeper and you're going to regret it.",0
6254,3.0,"""The Rise of Skywalker"" was fun! Delightful and nostalgic. It was jam-packed with information and at times felt rushed, but overall it had me smiling and kept me interested!",1
6255,8.0,"It was an enjoyable a movie that had a lot of fun callbacks and awesome action scenes, but always had a convenient answer to the problems given to the protagonists",1
6256,6.0,"The movie that ends the Skywalker saga as done more than just this. A emotional journey, that constantly made me fear the fate of the rebelion and the main characters. Have some moments to remember in the years to come.",1
6257,8.0,The Rise Of Skywalker is a beautiful movie and an amazing finish to the saga. Any novice fans of the series will be able to see clear nods to past movies and for those more invested they will notice some subtle but meaningful aspects. All in all its a great movie and a satisfying end to the story of Skywalker.,1
6258,10.0,"JJ rights the disgraceful wrongs of the The Last Jedi the best he can. As a huge fan I really enjoyed this film, I may not have agreed with every decision but that's ok.",1
6259,10.0,"The worst film of the saga, don't waste your time, give me back mine 😭",0
6260,2.0,"Yeah, I know that this movie is not for everybody's taste. Following a mess that was TLJ, this movie had lots of recovery and character development that needed to be done. In my opinion JJ Abrams did a great job to accomplish this goal and try to lead the movie into a climax. I'm not a great writer so I'll just try to list the things I liked, felt flat and some of the missed opportunities",1
6261,8.0,This film is a success. I loved. There are beautiful moments of emotion. What a pity that we had to go through two rather average films to reach this conclusion rich in many ways.,1
6262,8.0,"First of all, If you happen to be a father like myself, I recommend seeing this film at least once. Second of all, there has been a lot of whining and complaining about plot holes by people who don't realize that these plot holes are by design. This franchise will probably NEVER end. There is too much money to be made here. Some people just don't know how to enjoy movies or just want to pick apart movies just to project false intellectualism. My main gripe about this film is that it has caused trolls to make too much noise about it, therefore, irritating me. I gave this film a 6 because it is more than halfway decent and this film DOES out-perform the two previous installments. Despite the movie's flaws, the question remains: Will the average film-goer find this movie entertaining? The answer is YES. And be thankful the movie is condensed below the 3 hour mark!!! I did. I am willing to sacrifice extra minutes of dialogue and plot hole fillers just so I don't have to hold my urine anymore than I have to.",0
6263,6.0,"Hi there,",0
6264,3.0,"I can't believe this has a lower rating than the crap fest that was The Last Jedi. It must be the in thing to hate on Disney and Star Wars. I've been a fan since ANH came out and I was four when my Dad took me to see it, so I'm actually pleased Abrams has done his best with the absolute mess Johnson made of the trilogy. The fanboys are howling about Palpatine being a cop out. And...? What else was he going to do after Snoke was unceremoniously cut in half? Bring back Vader? Build another Death Star?<br /><br />I know you can't please everyone but some of the comments and reviews on here are like petulant children whining because they didn't get the Xmas present they wanted. You do realise it's so called fans like you that make the rest of the fan base a laughingstock amongst regular filmgoers? By all means post a review giving reasons for disliking it, but ffs hating on it just because it didn't suit the idealised version you had in your heads is just pathetic. Yes, it's rushed in parts, yes there are still some loose ends not tied up but J.J. has done his best. Think yourselves lucky Johnson wasn't directing it. God knows where the trilogy would have ended.",0

6266,7.0,"A saga ends... for now! Star Wars followed me since my kindergarten time and thus almost my whole life. It became a part of me and has remained so. For this reason, going to the cinema was one with mixed feelings.<br /><br />It is generally difficult to write a review and compare this one (and the other two from Disney) with the old Star Wars movies. I decided for myself that I can't evaluate the three new movies with the same standard, because the first 6 episodes, for me, are in a different league. Episode 7 was a good start (even though there was a lot of copy & paste from the previous trilogies - which didn't bother me, because Star Wars just did). Episode 8 was unfortunately a disaster after Rian Johnson symbolically gave all Star Wars fans the middle finger. It was almost impossible to achieve a satisfying ending in episode 9.",0
6267,8.0,Best love story in Star Wars. Period.,1
6268,,"First of all ive loved star wars since i was 10. Grew up on the original trilogy about the time the special editions were coming out. I really did like the prequels, with ""revenge of the sith"" possibly being my favorite star wars film overall. One thing in the George Lucas era of star wars was that each film built on what came before it. The prequels expanded the galaxy with new worlds and creatures and environments and gave a great backstory to how the galaxy came to be under the empire in the original trilogy.<br /><br />When disney announced a new trilogy i was hopeful but from the first moment knew they were heading down a dark road. Before i get to the new movie first of all they destroyed everything the rebellion achieved in the originals, along with all the old characters before killing them off one by one in favor off poorly developed new characters. What they done to Luke was unforgivable.<br /><br />However i was going to go see this first chance i got simply because it was star wars and somehow the greatest villian palpatine was making a return.",1

6271,9.0,"I don't understand why everyone hates this movie. I heard about the bad reviews going in. I've loved Star Wars my entire life, one of the first movies I remember seeing in theatres was the Empire Strikes Back. If that movie is rated as an 8.7 on IMDb, and The Last Jedi is a 7.1, then this one is at least a 7.5 - 8.0 . It's not perfect and yeah there is a bit of Disney's touch. But it's way better than the Last Jedi. Like no boring Casino heist plot involved with this one.",0
6272,8.0,"First of all, this movie is very competent and fun, the narrative depth and TV series flavor of a few moments bring this movie a rhythm never before performed so well in a Star Wars movie.<br /><br />Many features that were always missing in SW movies have been added. The people who don't like this movie are the ones who wouldn't like it in any way, no matter what it was like, so if you want to see a fast-paced adventure-action movie with an immersive narrative, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Stop listening to frustrated fans who would complain about anything anyway. It's 2019, there's no way to make a movie in that same 1977 standard, things have evolved, Star Wars has evolved too.<br /><br />However, I admit that there is a lot of turbulence in movie 9 due to the lack of objectivity of movies 7 and 8, but nothing that detracts from the experience.",1

I hated TLJ and this is much, much better. The plot is better. The storytelling is better. It is rushed at some points but there's a lot to fit in!",0
6276,7.0,It was an amazing movie experience. I loved it. People maybe raised their expectations too high.,1
6277,9.0,"Loved it. Simple as that. My son, wife and i walked out of the cinema smiling ear to ear. Maybe its the fans that need to change not the directors. They seem to be stuck in the past.",1
6278,8.0,"Most of the extremist reviews are misguided by passion. The movie is not terrible, but not epic either.<br /><br />It felt like it didn't really know what to do with the established story.<br /><br />You either love or hate The Last Jedi. Personally, I think it was great, it was daring, and it was a pretty ballsy move to exlpore new dimensions of the charaters, to go into the grey area. Well, yeah, flying Leia and the pointless sidequest with an unnecessary sidekick was rather dull and was met with dissatisfaction. Alltogether it was different. And anyhow, even if you hated it, it was a story that was supposed to be continued.<br /><br />But no, Ep IX simply grabbed what it liked, like the force bond, and the possibility of a redemption story arc, and discarded everything it didn't like, such as the nearly total annihilation of the Resistance.<br /><br />Witers couldn't handle the passing of Snoke either, they had to revive a known archvillain and planetkiller weapons which felt rather forced. Rey's heritage is once again important, her parents are not nobodies anymore, Kylo reforges his mask, a clear and visible message that Abrams is steering the story back to his vision.<br /><br />And that's all right. But he spends so much time on it that he doesn't have enough left to establish and execute and actual story, it just throws one scene after another. And they are great scenes. But there is no beginning, no real end, no story to properly tie them togerher.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a tremendous amount of fan service. For Junior to a certain reward a certain character finally gets after 42 years, a lot or things that will be truly appreciated by those who followed the saga for the past four decades.",0

6282,9.0,"Star Wars is stupid fun. But most importantly it's stupid. If we remember that, no Star Wars movie will disappoint us too much again. The Rise of Skywalker is a fun movie with some beautiful imagery, over the top dialogue, more cameos than the Oscars, and a healthy dose of pretty good character moments. If you go looking for a fun laser sword adventure with some incredible visuals and perfectly passable (and occasionally surprising) performances, you won't be disappointed. If you go hoping to find George Lucas, he's not here. And that's kind of the problem when it comes to Star Wars and its fans.",0

6288,9.0,"Went into this film expecting more than most because it is apparent that reviews for this franchise can rarely be trusted. The Star Wars universe has morphed into its own life form and with that brought the expectations of millions of films that have come before...I can say without a doubt The Rise of Skywalker was absolutely incredible. It is truly a captivating and beautiful piece of art and I'd recommend it to all. The story itself was moving and thoughtful, with the visuals taking it to the next level. The brilliant acting fully pulls you in and it is quite the experience to have with your fellow cinema-goers as you witness the twists, turns and gut wrenching moments that turn this into a truly epic story. I have to say that I'm so lucky I was able to experience this in my time and will forever be grateful.",1
6289,10.0,"Absolutely loved it. Amazing, all those who gave it poor rating before it was even realised! True Star Wars fans will get that this is a couple of hours of action, and adventure, which nicely wraps up the series. Shame on all those trying to be cool and pan this.",1
6290,10.0,"This movie has lots of great, face service type of moments that bring up tons of nostalgia to long time Star Wars fans. There are a few great moments but the bad outweighs the good by far. The plot is a mess and makes zero sense in many parts. I seriously felt zero emotion from the new main cast of characters. The only part that got me remotely choked up was from Chewie.

Towards the end, I nearly fell asleep and found myself getting annoyed at how bad it was.<br /><br />Badly written, parts of the plot made no sense. Bringing Palpatine back smells of desperation to try and salvage the damage of TLJ (although I actually thought that was ok, and is far better than this drivel), but it just undermines ROTJ.<br /><br />The mad rush of tens and nines being awarded are because ultimately it has lightsabers and tie fighters etc. But give it a few weeks, analyse the plot and the gaping holes within and it will soon become obvious what a turkey this is.",0

There were a few annoying gaps in the plot and the fact that they brought Emperor Palpatine back from the dead is actually the worst thing ever. But. The jokes were good. Feelings were had. I don't think it was as bad as people are making it out to be. I mean....it's no Cats.,0
6309,8.0,The last film of the new trilogy has some greatness but also some lack of new inspiration. It's nothing new breathtaking in the main story from the first and second film but if you are going to see it see this film in IMAX quality.

Because of that, some parts felt rushed and was a conclusion to a three movie story watch that had to really just rely on two.",0
6312,8.0,There is so much in this movie that makes no sense... the plot reads like below average fan fiction... heck electronic arts and BioWare came up with better storylines than this movie.,0
6313,3.0,The storyline was very poor written. However the visual effects are impressive.,0
6314,6.0,I love Star Wars... I think the loud minority who are overly invested in the franchise are ruining this film's credibility. I thought it was very enjoyable.,1
6315,10.0,"The movies really shouldn't of been made unless they used Jaina and Jacen Solo as the main characters. They could of started with their childhood or even started right after Jacen turned to the dark side.<br /><br />Besides Lando, Leia, Luke, and Han, none of the characters were even remotely interesting and any lightsaber fights were really ho-hum kinda fights. Nothing stuck out that really made me cheer.",0
6316,2.0,So much better than episode 8. Goosebumps all the way,1
6317,10.0,"I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life, and to say I had been disappointed in where Disney had been taking the saga is an understatement. I went into this movie with lower than low expectations, thinking it would be the final nail in the coffin after The Last Jedi. Oh how wrong I was. The beginning was a bit slow and chalky, but I'd just chop that up to trying to write around Carrie Fisher's old scenes. Even though it was chalky, the way they used Fisher for the film was much better than killing her off screen or pushing her off to the side. She actually mattered. The reveal that Rey was a Palpatine too was ingenious. It gave her that link to the Skywalker saga while not giving into the super popular fan theories just for the sake of it. The Skywalker's started with a Palpatine and ended with one. A Palpatine gave the Skywalkers life and a Skywalker finally returned the favour. Ben's sacrifice of his life for Rey at the end was a perfect conclusion for his character, he came back to the light just as Vader did. In the words of George Lucas, Star Wars is like poetry. It rhymes. But out of all of this, my absolute favourite part was the vision like scene with Harrison Ford that absolute blew me away. This was certainly a well kept secret that he was in the film, and that completely paid off in the end. I couldn't stop crying because of the beauty of the moment. My favourite character, back for one last goodbye, to complete the task he failed to while he was alive. That is the theme of this film. It completed the task of making a great Star Wars film that has failed to be done since Return of the Jedi. You did it, Disney. You made a fan's heart melt with joy. You made a fan's night. You made a fan cry tears of joy. And that's what should matter when it comes to these things, not pleasing some washed up critic, not attempting to swoon the general public with bland uninteresting rehashed garbage, but with a story made for the people who love that story the most. What else is a sequel for?",0
6318,9.0,"Don't listen to the nay-sayers! Giving it a 10 to boost its rating + because it's worth it, as it's finally a dynamic action-packed Star Wars movie that you can enjoy watching a second time even with a week / soon after the first time (and I rarely go for a second time to movies). After reading the discussions and negativism on every possible topic (15 unanswered questions of the movie, 5 things that it did wrong, etc.) and watching the movie again, I have to say that it's perfect in every way - it answers everything that it has to answer, takes care of everything as a final movie, and I enjoyed watching it again for a second time.",1
6319,10.0,"The opening crawl says there's a message from Palpatine, and that's as spoilery as I'm going to get. The action is fast and exciting, the banter between Finn, Poe, Chewie, and Rey is fun, the relationship between Ray and Kylo is fantastic, there is blaster fights, ship battles, lightsaber duels, twists and turns, cameos, new characters, some fan service, some poignant scenes with Leia, and an epic ending. As a late forty something man who saw the first movie when I was six years old, I had a grand time, I cheered, gasped, and cried, It was almost everything I hoped it would be. (P.S. I hated The Last Jedi, and this almost undoes the damage that one did, at least for me.)",1
6320,8.0,"Thank you! I was there in line to see the original Star Wars when I was eight years old. We waited for hours! I am now in my fifties and I still love all things Star Wars. These new movies are amazing! I don't know how many time I nudged my wife saying ""Look! do you see that?"" or Look at that! That's amazing!"" or ""Look who just showed up and look what they did!"" I truly felt like I was eight years old again! To all of you who don't think these movies catch the vision of ""what"" Star Wars is supposed to be, I'm sorry. I feel if you would have relaxed and just let your inner eight year old soak up all the magic and wonder of these movies you would have enjoyed them more. To me they were amazing! To all of you who brought me these movies, THANK YOU! Please bring me more of this amazing universe!",1
6321,10.0,"Before watching the movie I watched alot of the reviews by critics and saw some leaks (but tried to avoid them). I didn't like The Last Jedi and hated what Rian Johnson did with the Star Wars franchise, because The Force Awakens was a good movie.",0
6322,8.0,"Having been a Star Wars fan for over 4 decades I entered the cinema with high hopes and those hopes were not dashed. This is a great conclusion to a not very well planned trilogy. Lucasfilm seem to have had no plan going into this other than let's have 3 filmmakers make a film each. This does seem like a strange plan for a trilogy. Although there clearly was no story plan J.J. and Rian have delivered 3 highly enjoyable and entertaining movies culminating in TROS. This film first and foremost is a great piece of entertainment aimed at healing some of the divisions from TLJ, which I loved by the way. I have read many a review on here basically trashing the movie saying once again it has killed the franchise, but I can honestly say the franchise has never been healthier I for one will be waiting with baited breath to see where in this galaxy far far away we get to go next. For now disengage brain and enjoy what Star Wars has always been about, having a fun time in the cinema",1
6323,10.0,"Just got back from the latest Star Wars movie and created my account because I was that disappointed - no spoilers reviews. Taken on its own, this movie would be entertaining (even with its dozen plus plot holes), but true Star Wars fans will see this movie sadly continues the destruction of the original six movies' (plus Rogue One) plot lines. Vader's sacrifice and the celebration of the Rebels victory in Return of the Jedi were all for nothing. Rey continues her use of new Force powers she just suddenly knows how to use. Force ghosts also suddenly have new powers. Even the title of the movie doesn't make any sense - you'll see why. This whole trilogy was sadly a waste of good talent and potential with poor, conflicting scripts. I'll consider this trilogy a fantasy, and forget about it.",0
6324,2.0,"I saw the original Star Wars back then in the cinema. I was 10 years old, sat on a wooden chair and was mesmerized. It was a great story about a young man and his friends who battle an evil Empire. A simple plot, but wonderfully made, likeable characters, great performances. Sir Alec Guiness, oh, he was truly great as mentor and father figure for Luke.",1
6325,,"To begin with, The Rise Of Skywalker is an excellent movie. Regular movie-goers should be able to see that. Brilliant cinematography, acting, scoring, directing in general. JJ Abrams knows how to make a good movie. Star Wars fans now should be more than happy. Not only is it an improvement from The Last Jedi (which was also a good movie objectively speaking) but it also gave tha saga a more than satisfying ending. The non-stop action, excellent dialogues, incredible storytelling and writing, tear-jerking scenes, etc were more than enough reason for this movie to deserve an objective 10/10 rating. This movie easily stands next to Empire Strikes Back as the best star wars movie.<br /><br />I wouldn't really listen to critics, biased fanboys or people who think are real star wars fans just because they were in a movie theatre in 1977. I've personally seen every movie, animated and live-action show, read many many comics and novels, all of which is more than those fans I mentioned earlier have done. Meaning that I can review this movie knowing more about the sw universe than people who give TROS low ratings just because ""it's not the ending that they wanted"".<br /><br />Go watch this movie without listening to anyone and make up your own mind. Everyone who worked on it poured their heart into this film. It deserves our love.",1
6326,10.0,6 seemed too low so I went with a 7. It wasn't terrible or anything but it just wasn't very good either. Nothing memorable about it and I lost interest after a couple of the cheesy scenes. Watch it but don't expect too much.,0
6327,7.0,"The movie isn't a 1 or a 10. It's somewhere in the 5-8 range. To me, I actually prefer The Last Jedi to this one, but I wasn't crazy about TLJ when I first saw it either. This whole movie felt like a stretch, like they were trying to meet a deadline and just rushed through certain parts. The best part was the humor, which Abrams also managed to get just right in The Force Awakens. Just like in The Last Jedi, this movie was full of WTF moments. Whether TLJ or this movie had more WTF moments is debatable. The good parts of the movie outweigh the bad so I give it a 6. Each time I have watched TLJ I have liked it a little more. Maybe the same will happen with this one.",1
6328,6.0,"Ignore the questionable intelligence who rate this movie poor. They have clearly forgotten the essence of the original movies, and what Star Wars is all about.<br /><br />Clearly it's fashionable nowadays to slate something clearly remarkable in order to look different and 'cool'.",0
6329,7.0,"But as a Star Wars movie the rise of Skywalker left me disappointed in the movie chair. The overall storyline was in my opinion great and had a fitting conclusion for the franchise, but the execution was very rushed, the plot was filled with bad ideas, big time jumps and no time for character development. The sceneries, architecture and landscape looked amazing, but it was always the feeling that they focused to much on making those amazing scenes without thinking about any sense in it. There was no time to transition from one story or scene to the other. 2 movies would have suited the story much better.<br /><br />The action was good but did not catch me as much as the ones in episode 1-6. Something like Yodas fight scene in episode 2, Luke against Darth Vader or the one between Obi Wan and Anniken is not seen in the movie.",0
6330,6.0,"I think everybody is overthinking this a little bit too much because of their nostalgic love for the original Star Wars trilogy. Yes Nothing Compares to episodes four, five ,and six, but if you go by pure entertainment value it was a pretty entertaining movie and a lot of the old characters from the old movies that we all loved and it kind of summed up this set of movies and I think the best way they could have... if you want to dissect this movie and compare it to the other 8 movies made I give it 4th Place out of nine.. go watch it in 4D it was pretty awesome. And yes I don't really like how they handled Luke Skywalker, and yes there's a lot of things I don't like about the movie being a Star Wars fan, but I have to admit that I wasn't all that disappointed with this final movie at all.go watch it ,enjoy, have fun.",1
6331,9.0,"What have Star Wars fans been begging for? You get it here. Skywalker ascends as the movie event of a generation. Takes the best parts of TFA and TLJ and concludes an exceptional story. It's great and in the middle gets even better than ESB at times. Seeing all the Jedi come back in an Endgame fashion. Arcs are completed and all the cameos, flashbacks, time travel moments and fan service all works to benefit the story. Nothing is forced in for the sake of pleasing an angered fanbase. They go all out to making the impossible Star Wars we never could've imagined. Seeing Anakin and Luke take on the Emperor's spirit while Kylo fights the Emperor's physical form finally shows us the true power of a force ghost. Teased since the beginning in Episode 4 Obi-Wan said if he is striked down he will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. We finally get to see that in the end.",1
6332,9.0,"I have more than 40 years invested in this series, and I've been selective in seeing only the original trilogy and the newest trilogy. And only in theaters where the full effects can be felt. No prequels, no odd rip-offs, no watching on TV with commercials. And only showings when school is still in session so I can enjoy the movie with just adults. So, yeah, I'm a big fan.",1
6333,9.0,"Have seen Star Wars 1-9 on opening day... every single one. Admittedly, I was upset when I read all the negative reviews coming out of the LA opening. Well, guess what, this was likely the best of the series. Truly excellent. I mean some of the reviews just blew me away for their twist. Example... someone complaining about the sunset at the end? Seriously? In short, an epic finale to an epic series. I enjoyed the 40+ year ride. Thanks George Lucas for having basically launched a genre and a production expectation.",1
6334,10.0,"A spectacle, but plot had major pitfalls. Adam Driver is excellent.",1
6335,6.0,As a Star Wars fan from the start this was almost everything I wanted. Don't listen to all the negative reviews go watch and enjoy.<br /><br />A proper goodbye with a lot of loose ends tied up.<br /><br />May the force be with you !!!,1
6336,9.0,"Going into this movie I was skeptical about how they were gonna follow through after The Last Jedi's somewhat odd ending simply because it left a lot of blanks but also closed a lot of storylines opened up in The Force Awakens. The first segment of The Rise Of Skywalker gets straight to the point which left me somewhat uneasy for what was to follow but around the 20-30 minute mark the pace settles and you are in for a spectacular two hours of a great story. Reys struggle with who she is, Kylos struggle between light and darkness, The return of Palpatine out of nowhere was kinda weird but it plays out alright, and the true story of the Jedi vs The Sith. I enjoyed it. If you love Star Wars you will enjoy it. It's a great film. It doesn't try to be anything more than a Star Wars movie.",1
6337,9.0,"TROS is basically exactly what I foresaw happening ever since I realized the destruction TLJ caused to the saga. One could argue that said failure was set in motion since TFA, but I think it was TLJ that sealed it in stone. TLJ enforced the irrevocable destiny of TROS to be a pointless mediocrity, a pretentious sleeve of nostalgia to mask the desperation and despair that dominated the minds of its creators and investors.",0
6338,2.0,"Before I try to rate a film like Episode IX, it is important for me to recap the circumstances so that it is easier for me to assess the conditions under which the film was made. As we all know, TLJ was discussed very controversially for several reasons and led to a certain division within the community. So J.J. had a very difficult task. On the one hand, he had to satisfy the nostalgic and critical of the story, but at the same time, he couldn't forget the TLJ fans. To put all this in a single film so that it makes sense is another handicap with J.J. had to live.",1
6339,9.0,"This was a good movie. JJ Abrams did an excellent job closing out a potentially disastrous trilogy. I didn't hate TLJ, but didn't love it either. The Rise of Skywalker closed nine movies coherently and served fans as well. The only person who should probably be upset by it is Rian Johnson. The story had moments where it was rushed, but there was a lot of ground to cover. I'm assuming some of that ground was supposed to be shared by TLJ, but instead TLJ had to be addressed more than it should have been. As someone who enjoys the entire anthology of Star Wars lore, I gave this one ten stars, if for nothing else being the best one of the trilogy by far.",0
6340,10.0,"This was a great watch. My 8yo was glued to the screen from start to finish. My husband and I both enjoyed it as well. Not sure why everyone is being so negative. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.",1
6341,7.0,Spoiler free!!,0
6342,10.0,"Star Wars was usually a good story, with great characters and strong plots. The storytelling in this was hamfisted, with leaps and holes. Links between characters, motives and characterizations, in general, were poorly done. The fights and battles are fun as always, but it just lacked the great story. The plot was too complicated and just didn't hit the right notes. I've been an easy to please Star Wars fan my whole life, but this left me feeling a bit let down.",1
6343,6.0,"Starwars Rey and Kylo trilogy is perfectly fine, ok this one has some minor points, it is little bit anti climatix, especially at the end, it could have more suspense. But its not garbage. Its far from garbage.",0
6344,10.0,"The writing is muddled and at the same time predictable. I was hoping this would tighten the laces on the post-quel series, but no. No real surprises or memorable scenes. In fact scenes that should have been epic were small and emotionless. As a person who's world changed forever in 1977, my expectations we're high for this in the new big budget era. Once the ship started going down, they obviously couldn't save her. Forgettable.",0
6345,5.0,Place one pretty women in our movies. Make your movies attractive.,0
6346,2.0,Went live on Wednesday in the Netherlands. 2 1/2 hours joyride in the Star Wars galaxy. And it was a joy to watch. Same director as the Force Awakens and it shares the same pace and atmosphere. This is kind of the Force Awakens part 2. Which is good. Brilliant mix of old and new. Closing all ends.,1
6347,8.0,Disney in full panic mode tries to delete the last jedi and at the same wrap up the skywalker saga. They fail. The story is on par with a mediocre episode of Hawaii blue. The most expensive (and good looking) straight to dvd movie in cinema history. This is AS far from star wars as it gets. Dont see this movie in the cinema. If you are a true star wars fan you WILL be dissapointed. Shame on you Disney.,0
6348,3.0,"Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, I'm a long time Star Wars fan and I can tell you that these so called ""critics"" are a bunch of Hacks!!!

Ignore the negative and focus on the positive.- Signed A Real Star Wars Fan",0
6349,10.0,"Ok so Im 37yrs old and I cut my teeth on episode 4, 5, and 6 as a child. Even as an adult I still watch them over and over. IMO nothing will ever be as good as 4, 5, and 6. So even after reading all the negative reviews I will still excited to see The Rise of Skywalker. Its the finale of the greatest movie franchise in the history of cinema afterall. The movie definately had some disney influence. Not quite as gritty and raw as ep 4, 5, and 6. But that being said I most definatelty felt the presence of George Lucas. There were also several super fan/nerd moments for me. As a lifelong fan of star wars I felt complete after seeing ep 9 and I really enjoyed it. If star wars has a place in your heart disregard all the negative reviews and go see it and form ur own opinions. For me it was most definatelty worth the price of a movie ticket.",1
6350,8.0,It makes me sad more than anything. What was the point in this trilogy other than to make money? From the start nothing new was out their for our characters. Instead we were introduced to three new people we didn't greatly care about. Finn Rey and Poe aren't bad characters but it's was our characters who should have carried the story.,0
6351,4.0,So much better than what i was expecting. The way how it all comes toghether at The end is amazing,1
6352,10.0,I can't imagine being JJ Abrams and dealing with:<br /><br />1. The backlash from The Last Jedi.<br /><br />2. The intentional twists from The Last Jedi that basically ignored much of what The Force Awakens established.<br /><br />3. The burden of ending a 9-movies saga.<br /><br />4. The expectations after Avengers: Endgame (which set the bar way too high!).<br /><br />5. The more intolerant society we live on when it comes to movies and pop culture.,1

6354,3.0,"I really enjoyed the movie, in particular the pace and the music. It addresses most of the questions and the main cast delivers. It's not a film of jedi vs sith as it is about sacrifice and empathy. I will definitely watch it again.",1
6355,9.0,"Disclosure: this is not a bot-post (hence my nickname tagged in the title). I watched the film in its entirety last night, focused, and without interruptions.

6357,9.0,"Like most of you I am suffering from PTSD (Post Traumatic Starwars Disorder) right now. But we go it for different reasons. 42 years in the making. Just think about it!<br /><br />But let me start from the beginning. When we first heard that it would be a new trilogy coming, most of us went YAY! When we heard that some of the original cast was going to be in it we went DOUBLE YAY! But then for som unfathomable reason Disney decided that the three movies were goning to have three different directors, and more unbelivable three different script writers!<br /><br />Imagine some one ordering a book to be written, and then assigning three different writers. One to do the beginning, one to do the middle, and one to do the end. With no or very little discussion between them. Ofcourse this would be a problem in the upcoming trillogy.<br /><br />Despite this unbelivable hurdle these three movies comes out pretty darn well. It hits all those cordes in us fans that we want in a Star Wars movie. No matter the scattershot plot, it is unmistakeable, with out a doubt, a full-on Star Wars experience! And that is what we all long for!",0

6359,9.0,"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is the third movie in the sequel trilogy of the Skywalker saga and is, in my opinion, one of the best and the worst Star Wars movies. There are many aspects of the movie that I enjoyed, and many aspects that I did not enjoy. With The Rise of Skywalker being the final movie the writers, Chris Terrio and J. J. Abrams had to find a good way to end the saga. They believe they ended the saga in the perfect way. I and a lot of other viewers do not agree.",0

6371,10.0,Its not the greatest movie of all time. But there is some upside to it. Even though it is kinda stupid like some harry potter movie it still is a enjoyable movie.

6372,7.0,Let's start with the positives (in what will be a negatives-heavy review). I enjoyed this movie. It was good to see the (cloned) Emperor who has real menace and Rey and Ren/Ben elevate the film whenever the focus shifts to them.,1
6373,7.0,One thing I will say is anyone who was putting on spoilers before the movie even came out saying what will happen and shit. Should be absolutely ashamed of themselves they deserve To be stabbed in the eye with a knife 🔪. I really hope they have a slow and painful death. But luckily Fans didn't take no notice and ignored those little Fags. You get people who make stuff up and then you get The odd true thing. Look in the hay stack long enough yal get the odd needle I honestly think IMDB shouldn't Evan allow reviews Before the midnight realise. It's Very stupid of them There no better. luckily it didn't spoiler it for any of the fans because Overall the film was fantastic Loved it,1
6374,9.0,"Avoid the criticism. It is an excellent movie. Everything that was expected to happen has happened. The only one I didn't like was that Kylo disappeared (died) in the end. Probably had a reason, but I didn't realize what it was. Anyway this movie brings us a great story and I think it has regained the brilliance this saga has accustomed us since The New Hope.",1
6375,9.0,Would've given 7.5 but ending was too bad no space for another hopefully it stays that way.,0
6376,6.0,"I loved the movie. I really did. Until the last 15 minutes or so. The ending just did not do it for me. Other than that, very good movie, and I think it's the best of the sequel trilogy",1

6380,8.0,"What a phenomenal conclusion to Star Wars. Ticked every box: great pace, perfect dose of action, drama, storyline, comedy, in fact made me laugh AND cry, and the hit all the nostalgia notes it needed to. This is how you end a saga as historic as Star Wars.",1
6381,10.0,This movie made for kids not star wars fan disney change this story to kids story,0
6382,6.0,"Regardless of The Unanswered Questions in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker contains everything you expected by the end of a nine chapter storyline as well as it connected everything together really well; not a moment passed that was boring and packed with so much action, emotion, nostalgia of the previous films. I walked in thinking it wouldnt be as good anymore because of the mixed reviews but to be honest, it was far better than I imagined and a s a true fan of the saga: I Loved It!",1
6383,10.0,"Well, where do I begin? First up let's get one thing straight; it's a film. It's not something that's capable of creating world peace or curing cancer, so it shouldn't be on any kind of weird pedestal.<br /><br />Of all the Star Wars films that have been made the pressure on anyone to make this one must have been phenomenal; the third of the new troubled trilogy, a major cast member who was not killed off in the previous film but has sadly passed away in real life, ludicrously over-the-top backlash from crazed and obsessed ""fans"" over the previous instalment to appease and somehow correct while avoiding creating a messy story, a film that specifically must include a whole list of things to even exist as a bonafide Star Wars film, enough plot twists to make it not entirely predictable, and to exist as the finale of 42 year old film saga that means so much to literally millions of people.<br /><br />So it's fair to say that from the outset it's basically an impossible task, to create a film that achieves all of these things and in a good way. In fact just agreeing to make the movie deserves a big round of applause and a medal for bravery. If you disagree with me so far, you should stop reading now.<br /><br />If you're still with me, you probably agree that the internet is sadly a place more people come to moan than to rejoice, and that alone is the explanation for the stupidly low score this film currently has (6.9 at the time of writing).<br /><br />For me, a 10/10 film is something like Shawshank Redemption or Jaws. Basically flawless films, neither of which had faced anything like the challenges listed Rise of Skywalker did when they were being made. So there's no way it can realistically get a 10, the highest sensible score it could get is probably an 8 or a 9.<br /><br />As a life-long Star Wars fan, I was really looking forward to this film, more than any previous Star Wars film.<br /><br />And as a genuine film fan (by that I mean someone who goes in to films not knowing anything about it) I simply hoped that the film would at the very least be good, so that I can enjoy watching it with my son and daughter once it's available to own.<br /><br />I'm so pleased to be writing now, 2 days after watching it, that it definitely exceeded my expectations. In fact I even found myself thinking ""Wow, this has now exceeded my expectations"" several times throughout the film. But that's probably because whilst I'm a big Star Wars fan, I also have a reasonable and balanced view of what's possible. And I also went in open minded and not knowing anything about it.<br /><br />Most of the negative reviews seem to be from hardcore ""fans"" who, for some unknown reason, read all the spoilers and leaked information prior to seeing the film. If these idiots can't work out that if anything is going to ruin a film it's knowing what happens in advance then more fool them.<br /><br />I was surprised several times throughout the film, pleased with how things were being wrapped up and moving towards its conclusion. And pleased that the story centres firmly around the characters that matter. It also did a good job of politely sidelining the less successful characters from previous films (Rose).<br /><br />It also did something that genuinely surprised me by the end; made me fond of C3PO again! For some years now he's annoyed me but he was so well handled in this film it was a joy to watch, he even managed to get me emotional at one point!<br /><br />In fact I cried three or four times throughout the film, once from an emotional moment of fan service, the others all from emotional moments relating to the story itself.<br /><br />Thinking back on it now it really only fails on one level; to make critics, hardcore obsessed fans and the general film-going public all happy. But seriously, was that ever going to happen?<br /><br />Well done JJ and the team. In my opinion, a huge success, given the immense uphill battle you and the team faced when undertaking the challenge of making this film.",0

6385,9.0,"This film made me feel like I was back in 1977. Definitely the best of the last trilogy. It has some flaws, but overall they tied the sage together nicely.",1
6386,9.0,"This review will be short, no in depth plot review, no real spoilers, but instead just what I feel having just watched the Rise of Skywalker. So will start with wow! Having read and viewed some of the reviews already out there and anticipated that the negativity within the reviews was by persons trying to grab headlines and get attention or was by those who wanted their own version of a story written as the final Star Wars final entry, I am not just happy to report but actually excited to report that this film is outstanding, it's entertaining from opening scrawl to final credit, I did not look at my watch once during the film, simply just didn't get time to take my eyes off the screen for fear of missing some stunning visual. So you are asking is this just pretty to look at, the answer is no on so many levels, it's not just pretty must stunning, draw dropping in places and there are so many other positives to say about this conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy, let's start by the talking about the acting, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are simply amazing, believable, intense and possibly the most believable charachters not just in the entire Star Wars series but could easily stand their own against any other actors.<br /><br />The action (which there is plenty of) is breathtaking at times, the scenery is, erm, well breathtaking at times, the story is, yep breathtaking with it twists and turns.<br /><br />For all the neigh-sayers out there scoring this film down because it wasn't what their minds had predicted it would be or it was too much action orientated, well tough! It's not your story which is just as well I'm sure.<br /><br />I saw the original at the age of 9 in 1977 in the cinema, I took my son who is 9 to see the Rise of Skywalker yesterday and this version created the same excitement for myself and my son as the original did all those years ago.",1

6388,10.0,"Disney completely ruined Star Wars but especially with this movie. Everything contradicts itself and the storyline makes absolutely no sense. For example: the fact that they brought back Palpatine. Palpatine was supposed to be destroyed by Anakin (Darth Vader) to bring back balance to the force. Was supposed to, until Disney and J.J. Abrams completely ruined it.",0
6389,1.0,Everyone try's to be different and cool by saying this film is bad but it's not. It was a nice round up of all the films. There were questions answered. A good end. Everyone stop crying about the film being bad. Stop crying understand it's good. Okay thanks.,0
6390,10.0,I absolutely love this movie in my opinion. Great Plot line and exhilarating performances from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. Only thing I had an issue with is the fact J.J. Abrams tried to squeeze everything together into one movie instead of making a 10th episode Star Wars X. Overall I recommend seeing this movie. In retrospect it's was a exhilarating movie,1
6391,9.0,"Anything Star Wars I love and this was fantastic. Im sure a lot of middle aged fan boys will be seething with rage, as usual the internet will do what it does best and will tear the film apart I'm sure but hell im going to see it again on Saturday 10/10. If you have a life outside of being a keyboard warrior, you'll love it too",1
6392,10.0,"When The Rise of Skywalker shuts and lets the actors and the story move at their own pace - like in the opening scene and a couple other stunning moments like the sword-fight on the Death Star ruins - it's possible to see a great film shine through the terrible muck. The Rise of Skywalker, however, rarely shuts up. The writing seems more focused on breezing you through crowd-pleasing moments than being thoughtful or interesting, and odd plot choices plus terrible pacing bog this movie down.",0
6393,6.0,"Loved it, everything I wanted it to be. Just enough nostalgia, mixed with new content, and a blend of the two in typical and non meta story lines. Amazing use of the series soundtracks too",1

6395,,"JJ had a tall order with what Rian Johnson did. I think he did nice job and it's better than what people are giving it credit for. There are a few plot holes and it is a bit rushed, but overall if you like The Force Awakens you will enjoy this as well. Don't listen to the negative people on the Internet - that's all it seems it is. Decide for yourself. 8/10",1

6397,9.0,Way too many plot twists but was better than expected. Story was kind of weak but the production was as usual really good,0
6398,8.0,I loved every second of it. Tons of nostalgia but with its own story. Wether they were mistakes or not this movie did a good job of tying up the lose ends. The end left me with a content and happy sense of closer,1
6399,9.0,Ignore the 1/10 from so called star wars fans. This was a fantastic ending to the saga. Great visuals. Cameos from past actors. I cant say much without spoiling it.,1
6400,9.0,Fixed the Last Jedi where they made Luke a loser. The film introduces too many unnecessary characters. They should have tried to develop their 3 protagonist on the last movie for star wars. They made a fitting ending to the series which this was all about.,1
6401,10.0,This movie does a great job of wrapping up the trilogy while also fixing the mess caused by episode 8.,1
6402,9.0,"I enjoy watching star wars, I've blindly enjoyed every star wars episode (the prequels weren't great but hey ho). The same is with this episode. It is an enjoyable watch, there's action throughout, a lot 'happens'. However, there is a distinct lack of imagination and innovation with this franchise at this point. I think writers in Disney need to take a hard look at the Star Wars franchise and take a look at what the likes of Marvel have done over the last 12 years, there is no better franchise for giving a satisfying end in the way that Marvel did and that is exactly what this episode is lacking, a satisfying, new and imaginative ending to what would have been a very good trilogy in the modern era of todays world.<br /><br />However, what we've had instead is a repeated storyline, the revival of the emperor which really felt like they ran out of good villains and the sudden change of Kylo Rens mind to the Jedi side was really lazy writing. It's felt like there has been a build up of Ren becoming more dangerous in the first 2 episodes, this one went the complete opposite way, it also felt a bit easy this time, I didn't feel too much suspense building. It also lacks complete sense that they kept Leia on in CGI form, the rise of a new leader would have been more preferable. I understand we saw Po take leadership half way through the film, but it all seems a bit too rushed.",1
6403,5.0,"There seems a-lot of negative review, but as a Star Wars fan I'd say coming out of the cinema I enjoyed it. The whole family on leaving the cinema were very impressed and also clearly enjoyed it. I certainly cared for the characters more in this film and got totally wrapped up in it. I saw the last one (TLJ) about three times in the Cinema but found some scenes of that a bit frustrating and though it looked fantastic, I didn't care about the characters as much. Yes with RoS they're re-tellings of similar tropes and character arches, but I'm not fussed about that. The original movie followed Propp's Narrative structure so cleanly and I think this really helped towards it's success. The last three new films have clearly been trying to emulate this. Rouge One Felt Fresh as it wasn't a 'Star Wars' film, and had the licence to be much grittier and darker. RoS is what it is; the ultimate sci-fi fairytale, pantomime of Good Vs Evil. It's epic, it's jaw-dropping, it's Star Wars.",1
6404,9.0,I enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker. J.J. Abrams does a decent job to give re-stage the scenes that gave emotional highs from the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The plot does seem rushed in places especially the beginning but it makes sense in continuity overall. I left theater satisfied with the fates of original and new characters.,1
6405,8.0,"I'm sad. Really sad. I strongly believe that Disney destroyed Lucas' vision. And why? Because Star Wars was all about the birth, the journey and redemption of Anakin Skywalker. So no Anakin, no Skywalker Saga. As long as you bring back the Emperor you must bring back Anakin. He is the chosen one. Not Rey, not Kylo, not even Luke. So yes this movie was a failure. No man. Rey is not the chosen. Bad too bad. Huge plot holes, everything too predictable. At the end? I just laughed but not from joy. It was ridiculous. So, it proved that Disney didn't have a plan for this new trilogy. They just wanted to make three movies for people who want to see a blockbuster full of visual and sound effects, something like Avengers. 5/10 for me.",0
6406,6.0,I dont think it was rise of skywalker and there was no point on rey taking ben's surname. Writing wasnt that good but all cg and actors was doing their BEST. That part of the mobie was great. I think the ending was do similar to Endgame and Ben's dying had no point at all. I can understand the force-bond between rey and ben but saving someone with the force was meh because we never saw it before (the great jedi master yoda clearly had no idea on it? He or the others never done that before ) the forcelight transition between rey and ben was so good though. I am giving the 7 for the love of star wars and the crew who abviously worked very hard on this,1
6407,7.0,"In all honesty this probably my favorite Star Wars after ROTS and A New Hope. Was there a lot packed into a 2.5hr movie? Yes. But it wasn't a giant mess as some are saying. It wasn't a perfect movie by any means, but the story was fitting and made sense for the most part. There are still some unanswered questions but it wouldn't be realistic for everything to be revealed all at once. The battles were epic and all in all it was a great movie.",1
6408,9.0,"A rushed and tired cash-grab, clearly stitched together at the last minute without any concern for narrative or audience experience. This somber abomination concludes what had already finished, extinguishing the small remaining flame that was the spirit of Star Wars.",1
6409,2.0,At the end the REM Knights were pure crap. I feel the movie was Ok for an episode 8. George Lucas could do it better. Sorry but it is the true. This last trilogy has something missing. Courage to do something new apart the previous trilogys. keep the essence from the past but not a remake of it. Landon did the same. the rescue of two heroes but nothing especial.,0
6410,6.0,"People base their opinions too much on others, they nevet say what they actually think and it annoys me a lot. It had a clear story, you got to know some of the characters backgrounds. I'm just trying to be positive here as you guys can't seem to be.",0
6411,6.0,"Let me state firstly that I would not call myself a Star Wars fanatic. I purely watch the franchise just to be entertained by the movie as it has been generally since they restarted the franchise with Episode VII and multiple spin offs. Especially after seeing the Mandalorians. I was also one of the rare one who enjoyed The Last Jedi. I honestly didn't give a lot of thoughts about how the story should be written, as long as the story is told well and clever enough to keep me entertained. But despite my low fanaticism towards the franchise, The Rise of Skywalker manage to still fail in so many levels...",1
6412,4.0,"As the credits began to roll, the theater audience bursted into a standing ovation for the conclusion to this trilogy. I was one of them. I never thought so many people disliked this movie with the initial response it seemed to get from an actual audience. That's why everyone needs to disregard any review less than 6/10. At the end of the day most, if you go into the the movie with an open and unaltered mind, then you will enjoy the movie.",1
6413,9.0,It was great I don't know why people don't like it. I guess it was the best end for all story of Star Wars.

6414,9.0,"This is a great movie. Sure, annoying Star Wars nerds who would rather constantly expand the universe with belabored fan-fics rather than bring anything to a conclusion hate it. I loved it. I saw it with my best friend and he loved it. People applauded in the theater. We wussed out and didn't ask the guy dressed as Obi-Won to take a picture with us. That's what Star Wars is about. Great fun movies and great fun fans.",1

And that they are having their very own star wars experience and loving it - I think - as much as I was at the time.",1
6418,10.0,"I personally can't understand why people are eating this movie so poorly. I definitely think that The Last Jedi wasn't great, but The Rise Of Skywalker was good. The cgi is amazing and the actors did a great job too. In my opinion, the story and plot flowed well and were very interesting. Overall this movie is surprisingly impressive and quite enjoyable!",1
6419,9.0,"I can feel (Excuse the pun) that most the people rating and reviewing this don't really appreciate Star Wars for what it is, bringing in the last two films into their reviews... The film was fun, and so it should be, everyone is slacking off details that don't even go wrong in my opinion, like the exploding ship with Chewy in it, everyone is looking hard for a bad thing about the film and they shouldn't be. I've been told to sort of turn half your brain off for this one, and it works. Don't stress to look for bad things, as you'll ruin the film for yourself! It's fun, the best out the last three and has a decent plot, if you love Star Wars then you won't want to get mad at this good movie, that's how everyone should feel but I guess there are always haters.",1
6420,9.0,MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!,0
6421,6.0,"This movie was incredibly rich and dense, with gut-wrenching drama, tons of amazing action, and a great story that tied everything together. Megalomania is a hallmark of any proper Star Wars movie and The Rise of Skywalker manages to move that bar a bit further. Closure was achieved, but it sets up the Star Wars Universe for the telling of many more epic stories.",1
6422,10.0,"I have been trying to work out why episode 9 has been slated by the fans so badly, when an Avengers movie can follow exactly the same ingredients and be called 'completely enjoyable'?<br /><br />And the answer is easy. Marvel fans do not expect an Oscar-worthy plot and character dialogue. They expect, as one other review put it, a '2 hour trailer' with a healthy dose of suspension of belief to guide the incredible plot along. Go and see Star Wars 9 with the same mind set and you will be just as happy as when you saw infinity wars. If you want episode 4 / 5 all over again, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Have fun!",1

6425,7.0,"I remember when me and my parents watched Star Wars - A New Hope for the first time togher on TV. It was by the begging of the 1980´s, We use to sit togher in front of our incredible 21 inch TV, had some goodies while me and my little sister commented nearly every scene of the movie at least with a whoaaa. We were astonished by the special effects and my parets proudly told us that they use to watch this movie in cinema years ago. From that moment on I fell in love with Sci-Fi. Star Wars opened my heart for a hole new universe full of possibilities and adventures. Later on the same year I discovered Star Trek - TOS and it was a done deal. I was about to become a nerd for sure :)",1
6426,1.0,"My biggest hope in seeing the film is that it would be better than ""The Last Jedi"" - which may have been a decent sci-fi flick, but was definitely not Star Wars (which has been admitted by many involved with the franchise, if by action, if not always by words). Thankfully, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" felt more like Star Wars - at least there is a better semblance of the classic trope: ""The Hero's Journey"" in The Rise of Skywalker, which is integral to Star Wars' classic theme, but was completely absent in the last film. The biggest drawback is the film-makers seemed to cram a lot in this movie, making it feel like it should've been 2 films, instead of 1 (which may be due to trying to make up for what The Last Jedi lacked).",0
6427,8.0,"I read the reviews, all the way from ""this is the worst movie of all time"" to ""best Star Wars movie yet,"" and decided to form my own opinion before trusting what seems to be nothing but hyperbole all the way around. The opinions on this movie are out of control. Was it a little heavy on fan service? Maybe. I won't give anything away, but there are virtually no unanswered questions at the end of this movie. People are criticizing it for that, but that's one of the prime reasons TLJ is so reviled!",0

The episode 8 left me upset and angry against Disney Star Wars but this one kind of ""redeemed"" my love and esteem for the Skywalker saga and I left the theater quite satisfied. I was thrilled with some of the visuals and battles and I was emotionally invested in some of the scenes for the first time (I didn't felt this when I watched episode 7 and 8). I also found that the arc of our main characters concluded in a satisfying way (especially Rey's and Kylo's).<br /><br />And trust me it wasn't an easy job to deliver a satisfying conclusion and please everybody especially after the terrible episode 8.",0
6439,7.0,"Spoilers ahead -<br /><br />Let's start at the end. How do you put a final bookend on a IX volume series written over the course of 40 plus years? You have to end where you started, in this case, Tatooine. We met Luke and Anakin on Tattooine and this is where we say goodbye to Rey, but also Luke, Leia, and all of our old friends as the the book closes at the end of the final chapter of the most epic saga ever told on the big screen. I couldn't have loved this ending any more. It just felt right.<br /><br />The other 140 or so mintues of the film did their best to give callbacks to characters and lines that we had to experience one more time. If you felt it was patronizing, you missed the point. We also saw new force abilities revealed, just like we first saw lightning from the fingers of the Emperor in VI. The healing from Rey was new as her power grew and in the end, it brought balance to the Force. The prophecy from Episode I was finally fulfilled.<br /><br />Interestingly, the 9 Episode story arc is really now the story of Palpatine and the Sith's long game to rule the galaxy. He along with Chewbaccca, R2 and C-3PO are the constants that anchor the story as we move from Anakin's story, to Luke's and finally to Rey's tale.<br /><br />The pacing of XI was great and seemed shorter than it was. The best thing about this movie was the score. John Williams bought back every feeling and emotion from A New Hope and hit the magical melodic lines at exactly the right moments. We got the full Jedi fanfare just when it was needed.<br /><br />Were there some silly creatures and bad jokes? Yes, exactly the right amount to be in line with Episodes IV-VI. Vader dropped some pretty corny dad oneliners in his day.<br /><br />This film was Star Wars through and through and Abrams delivered where Johnson came up short in Episode VIII.

The action sequences are stunning and Adam Drivers performance as Kylo Ren / Ben Solo is brilliant. If you didn't like it I suggest watching it again.",1
6447,10.0,"The star wars franchise has created some of the most memorable lines and scenes in movie history, but unfortunately for this movie and the new trilogy as a whole, it didn't spark as much emotion, or anything anywhere near as special as the original films did. The characters are alot less memorable than the original ones, even the characters who didn't play huge roles in the first films are more noticable and memorable than the new key stars in the recent trilogy. Even just after watching this film the names of the main characters are easily forgotten and dont carry a powerful story with them unlike the originals. This movie was attempting to display emotion, to end the 40 year franchise, but this movie lacked any real emotion, apart from the scene where carrie fishers character princess Leia died, but this was a character who carried such an emotional and powerful status that we all knew coming in to this film this would be a sad ending for her. Overall this film displayed good action, fairly good acting, a very debatable storyline but a undoubtedly a poor ending to the star wars franchise, although there was some very enjoyable scenes throughout this film which bumped my rating up to a 6 out of 10",1

I don't know how you can make something already bad (the series) and make it even worst.If you thought this was a 5 star movie you were very optimistic and thought the 1-3 trilogy was bad you gotta take that back",0
6451,1.0,"JJ, the cast and beyond did a fantastic job with the final instalment of the 42-year Star Wars saga in Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Early opening scenes of Leia training Rey on Ajan Kloss bare a strong resemblance to the backdrop or LucasArts' Knights of the Old Republic and BioWare's The Old Republic games. The characterisation was embodied at maximum throughout, with passion and conviction in every actor's performance. Introduction to new world settings was plentiful and cinematography at a high standard. Fisher's role, following her untimely death, brings an essential and emotional development to the plot. McDiarmid's reprisal adds a greater depth to the underlying backstory, with no shortage of surprising reveals and an unexpected homage paid to the expanded universe material. Themes are abundant yet none overshadowing another, entwined with a careful balance of light and dark; love and family ultimately being at the heart of the story. Episode IX pays numerous tributes to previous Star Wars movies, notably drawing inspiration from sequences such as the Tatooine Podrace and the Battle of Mustafar. Old allies such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Luminara Unduli and other Jedi make a cameo with their voiceovers, aiding the last Jedi in her stand against the Emperor. A slight disappointment being that no physical appearances were delivered to say a definitive goodbye to some integral pieces of the Star Wars puzzle, such as Obi-Wan or Anakin - though understandable when considering the climax of Episode VI: Return of the Jedi and the avoidance of history repeating itself.",1
6452,8.0,I for one thoroughly enjoyed. If only Abrams had directed the last jedi we would be talking about the trilogy as on par with the originals. I do feel Abrams had to address so many wrongs that Johnson created in the previous film which he does with great effect. I loved it!!,1
6453,8.0,"Enjoy this for what it is. The ""end"" of this story and perhaps the bringing of many more. Not a perfect movie. There are some things I would have done differently, but still a fun emotional ending to the Skywalker story.",1
6454,7.0,"There was a lot of stuff in this movie that I loved, and there was a lot that I didn't.",1
6455,6.0,"Well the cause for me giving this a 10 is that a movie must remain primarily an experience rather than analytical information absorption; and this was to me the most enthralling Star Wars movie I've seen since viewing as them as a teenager.<br /><br />To bringing closure to this trilogy, the story of Skywalker and the cast from the Original trilogy could only be an exceedingly difficult task to say the least; however in my opinion it was masterfully. With now strongly developed characters this is the climax of a journey of discovery shaping identity and purpose. The plot and narrative is excellent.<br /><br />It should be understood that with a gap of 32 years(I think) between episodes 6&7 the feel of this trilogy is understandably different but full of throwbacks and will I hope delight young and old alike.",1
6456,10.0,"Personally, I was never a fan of the writers developing Lucas' plot, taking place years after ""Return of the Jedi"". I would have been more interested in an entirely new narrative apart from what already was. Perhaps a look into something that occured centuries prior to ""The Phantom Menace"". This could have paved way for something truly exciting and with real potential without making any attempts to match or even outmatch the original franchise.",0
6457,2.0,"It's a terrible film with so many plot holes, It disgraces the originals.",0

6459,10.0,"The Force is not strong - even in this one - but it is the best of the new trilogy. Funny though, this being the best makes the 2 before even worse. I am not writing here about breaking Star Wars lore. If you are a fan of lore, you may take away a star or two from the rating I gave. I have a feeling that the makers of the films just dont care bat-crap whether the movies actually follow rules set by the other SW films. Its as if they want to give sad reacts to fans. Or they just dont care. I cannot know. Its just dumb.",0
6460,6.0,"Amazing, loved it, stop complaining, your heroes had their own journey, new people show up and have different journeys and they pick up where the old heroes left! So go with an open heart! REY IS MY HERO!",1
6461,7.0,"Because I actually enjoyed the movie, I've watched each Star Wars movie dozens of times and each has their flaws and this one does as well but the story line isn't half as bad as it's been made out to be in some reviews on here, the story gets wrapped up well, the score & visuals are amazing. Must admit I'm glad I'm not a massive fanboi because it must be excruciating going to see a movie you have decided you already hate before you have seen it.",1
6462,8.0,"I'm going to start by saying that, even though I've watched all the Star Wars movies, I'm not a die-hard fan and I have a difficult time remembering who's who sometimes.",0

6464,10.0,"Having grown up with Star Wars in my life, loving the original trilogy as a young child. Then being there opening night for the prequels as a teenager. This was a satisfying conclusion. I will sleep well tonight.",0
6465,7.0,"Yeah, JJ played it safe for the storyline, but they did introduce a couple of twists that open the door for a more interesting storyline. I'm sure it's hard to top such an excellent foundation but I'm thankful they are keeping this going. May the fan feedback will encourage the next director to take a few more risks.",1
6466,8.0,"Star Wars has always been a ride worth enjoying. It's full of hope, redemption, family, embracing who you are and not letting your past dictate your future, what can occur when you allow the darkness in you to be control you and what happens when you embrace the light. There is just so much in Star Wars it's hard to put into words everything involved. Do all the episodes always measure up to their predecessors? Absolutely not. While I enjoy to an extent the prequels even I admit they are flawed bogged down with bad writing and too much cgi. But I still like to watch them because they are Star Wars and I was there for the ride.",1
6467,10.0,"This movie is not nearly as bad as they say it is. I understand why all the fans are so upset at this point, but it's not because of this movie, it's because of the previous movie, how bad it was, how it didn't feel like a Star Wars movie, how the studio and the director treated fans like ""man babies"" instead of owning their mistakes, insulting their critics, instead of listening to them. So fans have lost their faith in the story, in the new characters. I think if that wouldn't have happened, this would be regarded as great Star Wars film. If they had done a different episode VIII, we wouldn't be here. It is not a perfect film, but it fixes most of what happened in The Last Jedi, that is a terrible Star Wars film, it's like the director didn't watch the original trilogy, it doesn't have world building, it doesn't even have a real lightsaber duel, it's awful. It makes Luke a Grumpy old man, after being the most optimistic person in the galaxy. Thus making The force awakens a worse movie. And It even kills the main villain of the trilogy, putting episode IX at an impossible position.<br /><br />The Rise of Skywalker has great world building, it's action packed, the visuals are awesome, the plot picks up where they left it and course correct it, has to dig up another antagonist, it gives good arcs to the characters, mainly Rey, Kylo,C3P0 (that was cool) and maybe Finn (a little), there are new aliens. They didn't do a Holdo maneuver. If you go with fresh eyes, understand where the story is, you are going to enjoy it. I bet children are going to love it. Like I said, it's not perfect, and is easy to tear a movie apart, but it's also easy to enjoy.<br /><br />The studio needs to learn from their mistakes, this movie tries to, so give it a chance. But there a bigger lesson for them, something Marvel has, a plan, a big big road map ahead, which allows them to put out 2 movies a year. There's no Star Wars fatigue, just bad movie fatigue, fans treated badly fatigue.",0
6468,9.0,Visually stunning. Kept my interest. I think the music could've been better.,1
6469,8.0,"Wasn't a big fan of TLJ. But I liked Rise of Skywalker. SW MMO:TOR players, could actually like this one. Especially if they played trough the Knights of the Fallen Empire story-line. JJ tries to fix Ruin Johnson debacle, unfortunately made some smaller lore mistakes on the way. Pacing of the movie was in turbo mode. Humor was on spot. So sad that the potential was wasted by killing Luke in the previous movie.",0
6470,8.0,"I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, but I enjoy the franchise. I totally get that it didn't meet people's expectation but it was better than the last one.",1
6471,9.0,"This was a good movie. It definitely has a lot of holes in it but I think that was because The Last Jedi was such a bad movie. If this movie was divided into two in order to allow the story to unfold more and we completely eliminated The Last Jedi than I feel many people would have a much more positive outlook towards the newer trilogy. It was very entertaining and fun and yes, I am a lifelong Star Wars fan as well.",1
6472,8.0,This movie is perfect! Perfect perfect perfect perfect,1
6473,10.0,"Not gonna lie, I didn't have high expectations for this movie, I just wanted it to be better than The Last Jedi, and wanted to enjoy the Skywalker saga one more time. After watching the movie, I have to say it passed all of my expectations, and it was so much better than what I imagined. It's not a flawless movie, but it's easily the best movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm. The visuals were awesome, cinematography was spectacular, and John Williams made another fantastic score, with songs from all the previous episodes.<br /><br />The acting was also really good, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley made a really impressive performance, but everyone else made a great job too.<br /><br />Don't want to go into the story that much, but personally I loved it, it felt like Star Wars, unlike the Last Jedi.<br /><br />For me this wasn't just the ending of the saga, but also a celebration of it.<br /><br />The ending was beautiful and kinda sad, but it was a nice ending to the saga.<br /><br />I think you shouldn't care about the negative critiques, just go to the cinema with a clear mind, and try to enjoy it. And if you don't like it, that's alright, but you shouldn't ruin the experience for others.",1
6474,3.0,"So you know what you're getting with Star Wars - Jedi, lasers, creatures, preachy morality, etc. but this one was lazy with every aspect.<br /><br />What's more they decided to undo the work of previous episodes with inconsistent character behaviours and abilities.<br /><br />I guess Luke, Han and the others from the first three movies were just giant idiots as they messed up and didn't actually resolve anything. In fact they seemingly made it worse for the whole universe for 50 years or more.<br /><br />That's what I hate about the new series - they detract from enjoyment of the first ones.",0
6475,1.0,It's a good movie don't listen to 1's. I love watching movies because they are movie for the entertainment. Watch it,1

6477,9.0,"If you are a big Star Wars saga fan, you'll like this film more than if you don't actually care about the characters' back stories, etc. I'm of the latter group, so discount my review accordingly.",0
6478,5.0,"The middle movie Last Jedi was garbage. Rise of Skywalker redeems this series of three movies. They should not have made the last three movies but this movie provides all the important things: chases, fights, rescues and Jedi/Sith conflict to cover over Last Jedi's faults. The movie has a heart. There is evil and redemption. Best of all there is closure. They can truly stop making Star Wars movies like this. The saga in nine parts has ended from the 1977 start.",1
6479,10.0,Jj abrams has done a brilliant job,1
6480,10.0,This is a decent story and much better than the last Jedi - I was disappointed after that film. Do not read these reviews and just go and see it. I think it may even be the best of the last six produced.,0
6481,8.0,The last one in the trilogy that explains a lot about it Don't give any attention to the reviews goo see it by yourself it full of suprises that you gonna love .,1
6482,8.0,"If your benchmark is the original trilogy, you will not give a lot of credit to this movie. Which i did at first, until i changed my benchmark. It was never going to be like the old trilogy, because George Lucas has very little influence on the script. His ideas were basically not taken by Disney. So what did the creators want to achieve? They wanted to bring that retro feeling back, putting into a new layer so tgat fans could enjoy... So i stopped comparing this trilogy with the original one and viewed it as its own... Then you'll see, it's a very enjoyable ride...",0
6483,8.0,"Amazing, and I legitimately loved every minute of it. Great story, great feel and a blast to experience! Can't wait to see it again!",1
6484,10.0,The Star Wars franchise seems to be as polarizing as the US political system. Everyone needs to calm down. This is a great movie. I was in a packed theatre and there was a standing ovation at the end when the credits roll. I've been a fan since 1979. I loved this movie.,1
6485,9.0,It is first time when a company and a director resigns to the will of the fans.<br /><br />This way they made a movie comparable with Rogue One.<br /><br />Well done Jar Jar it is first time I like one of your Sci-Fi movies.,1

6492,4.0,"Honestly to start this out I just want to say how strong this movie made Rey like she is honestly one of the most powerful characters we've seen in film in a while. The way she learns her origin,the rage inside of her, and also how she manifests it and uses it for the greater good. Before watching this I looked at the reviews to see if it was worth it or not. The reviews are nothing like what this movie holds. I'm honestly impressed with the visuals and how they maintained the story. Rey being A Palpatine was a suprising twist which is welcome after all the Rey Skywalker Theories. This movie is easy one of my top ten favorites of the year and I'm so glad I didn't trust reviews. Kylo Ren did an amazing job. I loved this movie all the haters are just mad this takes a different route and I think it had an amazing ending,opening. Some of the pacing was slow but I wish it was longer.",1

Some plot is like ""really?"", kinda discontinued and Mary Sue style of the overpowered characters which makes it looks like the Wuxia Chinese films from 1990's Hongkong TVB.<br /><br />Visual and sound effects are excellent. Shout out for making Carey Fisher's legacy remains, and for plotting and acting of Ben Solo very good.",1

I tend to watch movies later after the release, so I get a better chance of evaluating them, by reading reviews and talking with people, but as I know I'd watch Star Wars movies anyway, I watched this as soon as I can, otherwise media channels would spoil any surprise out of the movie. The film is visually astounding, the action scenes look good, though lack any kind of tension. The storytelling is also lacking, but you might enjoy it if you can sit back and don't want to think.

6508,1.0,I feel like this wasn't really a star wars movie. It made me laugh couple times here and there but I feel like star wars is a kind of movie that makes you feel about characters. I didn't feel that much at all. The development of Rey and Kylo Ren over the past 2 movies have been pretty subpar so this movie as an ending of a saga did not make me feel any emotions at all.,1
6509,7.0,One star minus: how Leia dies... It is soo idiot.<br /><br />One star minus: how Kyle dies. Does it make any sense at all??<br /><br />One star minus: when Luke catches the light saber preventing it to fall in the fire. As a ghost. And gives it back. Wtf????<br /><br />Another minus: how did Palpatine create a huge star-destroyer army? Which is bigger than ever before.<br /><br />Another minus: Rey has way too much power. She is simply the new super hero like in X-Men or the Marvel series.,0
6510,5.0,"This movie was clearly manufactured to please. It's not bad, but it is clearly a product of Hollywood and that is why I cannot fully appreciate it.

6513,8.0,"I liked Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker and it did justice to complete what The Last Jedi left off. The Rise or Skywalker firmly states that one doesn't need the precious Skywalker bloodline to be the master of your destiny, so to speak. Even if you're the offspring of the most evil person in the whole universe you can still be good. A Palpatine adapting the Skywalker name isn't a slap in the face for the viewers. It is the most Christ-like thing ever happened in Star Wars. The Skywalker siblings gradually give Rey a feeling of family, which she's lost since her childhood. I know what happened to Luke in The Last Jedi didn't make him so much of a father figure initially. But didn't he come to accept his misjudgments and acknowledged Rey's optimism to bring Ben Solo back to the good? ""Let the past die, kill it if you have to."" refers to the remorse or obligation one has for one's lineage. It works for both the light side and the dark side. Ben Solo kills his past as he was betrayed once by his uncle. But Rey's parents also try to kill Rey's past by saving her from the hands of Emperor Palpatine. This is a neutral quote but rather meaningful. It refers to the regrets we had made in our lives that we deliberately try to erase. However, in the end, destiny (or the Force) always brings us back to face our greatest fear. Skywalker finally becomes the embodiment of Jedi in this. Rey can be a Skywalker just like all of us can be Skywalkers. Rose's quote in The Last Jedi is not a throwaway line. Ben Solo turns good not by fighting what he hates, but saving who he loves. Ben Solo's grandfather Anakin Skywalker's greatest wish was to save his wife Padme from death. That was the reason why he fell to the dark side. Ben Solo succumbed to the dark side because he wanted to finish what his grandfather started, which has been to save the ones he loved since the very beginning. Ben Solo realizes that in the end and raises Rey from her death. This act completes the Skywalker arc. The setting matches the Space Opera in which George Lucas proposed. The title doesn't misguide the viewers. I think it's a very good film and isn't just a course correction like many have said. It actually elevated the trilogy as a whole.",1
6514,8.0,I have seen every Star Wars movie in the theatre from the very first Star Wars movie when I was 5 until now seeing The Rise of Skywalker. The wonder and joy I felt coming out of that first movie was felt coming out of this last movie in the saga.

It had excitement, added new story characters and enough nostalgia to accomodate the majority. Unfortunately for those who care more about waiting for what they originally demanded from Ep3... it's not happening. Lucas' creation has been passed on to Disney (too late IMO), who have enough budget and vision to deliver what it had to become this modern era - plus being $$ makers.

Each one of the series has a magic and when u can sit in a theater and see that magic on everyone's face than that is something. I enjoyed the rise of Skywalker as did each member I was with.

I was a little irritated with how Rian Johnson made The Last Jedi, yeah it's not perfect like we hope, but this is what is so visionary and extraordinary about Sci-Fi! It can go in any direction, and yeah, Abrams wanted us to think the rest of the story of the finale.",1
6534,9.0,"I found this movie quite enjoyable with a nice end, I don't rate it 10 because there is something about Rey that it could be handled it in different way but it doesn't matter much because at the end there is something that everyone must understand on his own.<br /><br />Don't trust other reviews, just trust what you see and don't watch it with high expectations just because you created your own story. Just sit and watch this nice and last movie of this saga!",1
6535,9.0,"The overall story is ok but safe and boring. That's it for anything ok, the dialog, the pacing, the jokes and even the music is bad. If you like Star Wars, imagine an ending and save yourself from watching this.",0
6536,5.0,"I enjoyed the first two very much, but this one is leaps & bounds better than those. Some (a lot) are upset at the barely existent ""PC"". It's just not there. The ""all the white guys are bad guys"" trope is getting old and it definitely doesn't pertain to this film. I'd give it an 8 or 9. The ending put it over the top for me.",1
6537,9.0,The film is good. Much better than the last Jedi which is crap. I'm happy with where it went considering the crap that was the last Jedi. Haters are film snobs who have a romantic view of the original films,0
6538,8.0,I don't understand why people are not loving this one. It has everything a star wars fan could ask for. A brilliantly made movie with nerve wrecking lightsabre battles and a mixture of comedy and tragedy with all kinds of surprises. Kindly avoid the negative reviews and watch the film. It's one of the best.,0
6539,9.0,"I grew up watching Star wars. I've loved every Star wars movie with the exception of last Jedi (solo was meh). I loved this movie. It was a fun ride, a great spectacle, and, in my opinion, redeemed this final trilogy. Go into this film with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",1

6541,9.0,"Millions in effects, only $2.99 for a script. The magic is gone. It's kind of ironic that Disney put the final nail in the coffin.",0
6542,6.0,"C3PO felt so bad in this movie he had his memory banks erased. Storm troopers were deliberately taking hits just to get out of the movie. Jar Jar Binks said ""Un theysa spaked mesa movie was bad"". This review may stink, but not as bad as the movie.",0
6543,1.0,"Very good movie, plenty of twist for real fans and a great way to end the franchise! Loved it!",1
6544,10.0,"Enjoyed watching Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker. Significantly better than the seventh part, but weaker than 8. The main minus - sometimes you need to turn off the brain. But it's shot very atmospheric, a lot of cool moments, I really liked everything related to the interaction of Kylo Ren and Ray.<br /><br />And in general, as for me, an excellent conclusion to this trilogy. Of course, there are controversial moments, but I did not invent this world, and therefore I perceived everything as a given and features of the universe. I didn't like the first 30 minutes - it's very sad, but then the buzz is right up to the credits. I didn't even look at the watch.",1
6545,8.0,"..and I liked it more than all three prequels! of course, you could whine about everything if you like whining as 1/10 raters seem to do.. but I really enjoyed the movie, I laughed, I cried, I had fun, and it never felt boring to me! 👍🏼",1
6546,8.0,"I will try to be as spoiler-free as possible. First, the pace is... intense. So many things happen so fast, it's not always clear as to why it's happening. Sometimes the acting is robotic and the texts really sound artificial, like they are always looking for a line that will go down in memories... JJ tried to answer every questions we could have had, which bring us to the point of having too many things happening in one movie... Maybe it could have been better if the pace had been slower, the whole thing made in two movies and with less crowd pleaser...",0
6547,6.0,"I found Episode 9 to be a great Star Wars film overall. It was fast paced, beautifully done, and provided an excellent ending to the Skywalker Saga.",1

6550,8.0,The movie was great loved the rey back story,1
6551,6.0,"People were gonna give this a 1/10 before they even saw it, it's undeniably a good movie. I personally thought it was fantastic, but there's no way it could be under a 7. Peoples reviews are so sad on here, leaving 1/10s for the dumbest reasons",1
6552,4.0,The plot feels a bit muddled up until the final act. However the movie does explain some plot holes while creating others.,0
6553,8.0,"I hated The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, and I thought this movie was amazing!! People giving it bad reviews are only hating because they don't think it was ""woke"" enough, which was exactly what made it a great movie.",1
6554,10.0,"Cute cameos, epic battles and story comes full circle. always must give 2 thumbs up! thx for the worlds you all create.",1
6555,8.0,"This film is so, so desperately tries to fix the damage done by TLJ (which is at least aprisiateable). But it has not enough time, it feels like at least two movie cramped into one. It's all ower the place, things happening way to fast, or off screen, or without any reason. Most of the resolutions feel unearnd.<br /><br />Overall, it's way better than TLJ, maybe on par with TFA.I think, if JJ had control over all three movie of the sequels, we could've got a very cool thrilogy. But we didn't.<br /><br />Because of all this, I felt both sad and somewhat entertained at the same time while watching this picture. All in all, I think if you liked the previous two films, you will like this one too. And if you didn't, you wont.",0
6556,6.0,This movie better than the other episodes I find it a good movie and has more actions and the villain is good for the movie again don't listen to most people comments they hate it for nothing it's not the perfect one but a good one to watch,1
6557,9.0,"In this film I felt Palpatine was more of a good guy than Rey & co, I was rooting for Palpatine and I felt Palpatine was less evil in this film so by all rights Palpatine should've won. Also the film wasn't British enough, there wasn't enough white people so I didn't find it very sexy. The characters except Luke, Ren and Palpatine were so boring, bland and had little to no personality. Honestly they were so emotionless and lacking personality that I predicted that the main new characters would be revealed as evil cyborgs sent to kill the lovely Emperor at the end of the film, and I wanted the droids from the Prequels to come back and save the Emperor from the main new characters democratic madness but unfortunately that never happened. I cried when the infamous words of 'Roger Roger' wasn't heard from cute Prequel battle droids. The plot was so simplistic that I think I could've written it when I was 7 years old, there was no complexity and there was nothing in this movie that we haven't seen 100 times before in a film. Such lazy writing and completely undermines the Chosen One prophecy.",0
6558,3.0,A lot of The Rise of Skywalker works really well. Most especially the characters but there a lot of problems with the story structure of this movie that keep it from going down in history as one of the great Star Wars movies.,1
6559,7.0,Amazing conclusion for this new trilogy!!<br /><br />Best Star wars film ever.,1
6560,8.0,"Based on how the middle movie, that should have answered alot of questions to the viewer, didnt acttually accomplish anything but weird and out of place jokes, I understand how hard it must have been to make this movie.",0
6561,10.0,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is far better than the last 2 installments in the series. This film fixes the plot holes of the other films and gives a identity to both Rey and Kylo. Emperor Palpatine's return is a bit shabby but having him back as the bad guy and have cool lines with epic lighting moves is worth it. The only part I did not enjoy was seeing Rey change her last name to Skywalker and bury the 2 lightsabers. I feel like there could of been a way more epic and satisfying ending to the Skywalker Saga. The lightsaber duel was cool but I wish Palpatine wipped out his old saber to battle. I hope that whatever they do next with Starwars, is exactly what George Lucas would want for the fans. Never let Rian Johnson touch SW again please.",1
6562,7.0,"Absolutely amazing end to the saga,great cameos and comedic moments were excellently timed.Amazing landscape and great depth to the stawars universe.I would definitely recommend to watch in IMAX !!!",1
6563,8.0,"In my opinion the best star wars movie from disney so far, but it have plenty to work on. Cgi are amazing but the plot not so much. The only thing good about this movie was Palpatine plot and Babu Frick.",1
6564,5.0,"Maybe a little less dramatic than the original trilogy, but this film has some of the best action and visuals in all of star wars. I had a blast watching this movie, of course it has some short comings and like all star wars movies before it, it has a good amount of corny moments in it, but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Best of the sequel trilogy.",1
6565,9.0,One off the best films if not the best and anyone who complains about it then let's see you write a better film.,1

6568,4.0,Best way to review this is to rank all the Skywalker saga.<br /><br />1. Empire<br /><br />2. A new hope<br /><br />3. Revenge of the Sith<br /><br />4. Return of the jedi<br /><br />5. Rise of skywalker<br /><br />6. Last jedi<br /><br />7. Force awakens<br /><br />8. Phantom menace<br /><br />9. Attack of the clones,1
6569,9.0,"I have grown up with Star Wars I was seven years old when it first released in 1976. It is a fine film that hit all the right notes and packs an emotional punch you are not quite prepared for. Despite what some are saying here who clearly have some unrealistic ideal of what Star Wars is and will be and probably too young to have watched the original films without preconceptions - this is a great film and a great Star Wars film. Those giving it a one, it's a shame you clearly don't get Star Wars.",1
6570,10.0,"Absolutely incredible. I am a huge star wars fan and have been my whole life. Please believe me when I say to ignore the negative reviews. Yes it rehashes elements from episode 6 but that fits in with Lucas saying his films all follow a rhythm. It was beautiful, a lovely use of old and new characters, amazing score and some of the best lightsaber, space and land battles the saga has ever seen and loads in there for die hard fans who absorb everything from the games to the legends material and a 42 year old wrong is put right. Please see this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1
6571,10.0,"Did J.J. Abrams mend the broken pieces from ""The Last Jedi""? Well, he did have Kylo Ren reforge the mask he shattered in the previous movie. That was one of the many indicators of Abrams trying to rewrite the events from the ""The Last Jedi.""",1
6572,7.0,"Why do so many dislike the last 3 SW films or the 3 prequels (fair do's hi's and lo's). Is it because expectation is too high? Is it the connections to sci-fi were sparked by SW 42 years ago & many of the people developed a sophisticated appreciation for the wider, more complex & fascinating genre, then also expected SW to become as advanced & nuanced, when really SW is for people of all (12+) ages & so would always struggle to reach everyone to full satisfaction if it's too ""clever""? Why not sit back & let TRS bring entertainment, nostalgia, smiles, maybe tears, & some closure... maybe enjoy SW as entertainment for the masses that it's apparently aimed it to be, now.",1
6573,8.0,As a die hard original Star Wars fan this movie felt so tight form start to finish. So so happy. So much to unpack I don't know where to begin. Need to see it again. Totally blew me away.

6578,4.0,"Haters are gonna hate. Don't listen to the critics and haters, they say J. J. doesn't understand Star Wars, but they are WRONG. Abrams just did a wonderful job ending not just Rey and Kylo Ren's story, but all the Skywalker Saga. The way to save the one you love like Anakin Skywalker wanted, and Leia's importance in destroying not just Palpatine, but all the Sith, with an act of pure love. Mother's love.",1
6579,10.0,Even though I heard about the bad reviews and criticism I did start to watch the movie with a fresh and open mind.<br /><br />But what a disappointment this was.<br /><br />The story did not keep me excited or wanting for more. I was even happy I made it through the whole thing.<br /><br />Feels so forced and uninspired.,0

We all know how the war ends as it is a foregone conclusion with the Evil ""The Maleficent 3"" Witch finally biting the dust!<br /><br />Sound familiar, heard this story before?

6592,10.0,I am a long time Star Wars fan. I thought The Force Awakens was ok. I was glad we didn't have CGI storm troopers. I thought The Last Jedi was ruined by forced tangents and gender politics. Which brings me to Rise Of Skywalker. They finally did it. They made a decent Star Wars movie. They somehow brought the story to a close and rescued it from TLJ. This is more like a sequel to TFA. There's a lot of negative reviews that I just don't get. I think people look at the old movies through rose tinted glasses. This was a good movie and good fun. Go see it and make up you're own mind.,1
6593,8.0,"It was such a big nostalgia trip with amazing character arcs coming to a close, intense story, beautiful cinematography and the best way I could have thought to end Star Wars after the train wreck of the Last Jedi. It does have some flaws with a few moments that were slightly cringeworthy and forced. However, I will always remember everything in the 3rd act and every characters arches were completely convincing and believable. With the late Carrie Fisher I was worried that they wouldn't be able to carry on Leia's story or kill her off screen but her time is balanced and the cgi is completely believable that a times I forgot about it. Overall, as a Star Wars fan for many years I am so happy with the ending and have a new film to add to my collection that I am happy to own and cherish it just as I do with the characters and this world that was created 42 years ago in 1977 (which I got the reference to the festival in the film). Thank you JJ Adrams.",1
6594,,"Yes this triology seems, and probably was focus group based, made to sell toys, character development isn't the best, it's a copy of all the previous movies, leaves questions unanswered, and worst of all, it lacks a true poetic statement of the human condition. IT'S STAR WARS! It has laser swords, the Force, spaceships that violate the laws of physics. It's fun and emotional. It's great!!",0
6595,7.0,"1st Let me say - THE ACTORS KILLED IT! AMAZING ACTING!!<br /><br />2nd This should have been broken up into TWO movies.<br /><br />I just watched The Rise of Skywalker and enjoyed it even with the gazillion plot holes, I was left with an overall happy feeling and most importantly CLOSURE. This is coming from someone who disliked TLJ with a passion. Looking at the film objectively I would rate it a 4 out of ten, BUT when I add my LOVE for Star Wars and that passion which stayed with me since watching the OT in theaters growing up I give it a 6. I think Ryan's film totally ruined the trilogy and can only imagine how much better this could be. Epi 8 doesn't exist to me in cannon. In the end I will prob forget Epi 9 in a day, but man did I ball my eyes out multiple times knowing this will end the Skywalker saga (until they make more). I feel at peace. I feel CLOSURE.",1

This movie was much better than the previous two entries, where both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi felt somewhat like ""first"" films, as in, the sequel trilogy could have been off to a good start if either of the two were the ""first"" to kick-start the sequel films under Disney. The fact that J. J. Abrams came back to direct only makes TLJ feel even more like the odd film out, being of a different tone completely from J.J.'s style and approach. If J.J. had stuck around to oversee the whole trilogy, I think it'd have wound up much more cohesive an overall narrative. BUT... that didn't happen, and this film kind of feels like both a second film in its first half and a third, final film in its last act, which didn't bother me; it just made it feel all the more epic, in my opinion.",0

Considering it would be impossible to release a Star Wars film which would please everyone, especially those of us who have turned completely sour, I quite enjoyed the film last night. I won't go into all the spoilers, the movie was not perfect of course, no movie is, but it should shock or surprise you a couple times, make you smile and laugh a few times, is quite entertaining if you enjoy Star Wars. Just grab some popcorn and enjoy it for what it is - entertainment. It is noticeably more enjoyable than the previous entry. I may actually go see it again",1
6608,8.0,It was too packed with action. There was no breathing room and no time to enjoy the amazing scenery. There is nothing wrong with the action scene's in themselves but it's important to have balance.<br /><br />So there were too many unnecessary scenes that made no difference for the story. It would have been better to slow down the story and instead focus on character building and relationships. Make the viewer feel more connected to the characters.,0
6609,6.0,Firstly dont listen to the critics and haters. This film is amazing. Ive just seen it here in the UK and it is so much better than the Last Jedi which destroyed Luke's character.

6611,10.0,"I, like any of you who have anticipated highly anticipated this movie, saw the early reviews for the film and was ready to be disappointed.This film is a lot of the things that critics have claimed. It jumps around quickly, its heavy on the exposition, and it really punches you in the face with fan service/nostalgia. It also has in spades the one thing that is the essence of a Star Wars movie in my eyes, heart.<br /><br />There's a scene near the end where you hear the voices of all the Jedi from throughout the saga and, in that moment, I was transported back to a little boy who wanted nothing more than to be a pod racer after seeing Phantom Menace on my 4th birthday. Back to a kid with a dream to avenge the Jedi order after seeing Revenge of the Sith on my 10th.<br /><br />This is a movie that you have to decide whether to love or hate. I hope you choose to love it, I did and I can't think of a more fitting end to the saga that has filled my life with wonderful fantasies for 20+ yrs!",1

Did the producer watchted any original starwars movie? I watch the first 3 each at least 50 times. I will forget the last 3 ones and will never watch them again!!!<br /><br />All this emotional crying for no reason. Please make a soap opera but leave your hands away from the greatest movie ever!!!",0
6618,1.0,"Palpatine's laughter returned to life and frighteningly similar to the one we saw in Ep III is the direct guiding thread of the three sagas of SW. It is as if his had always been the threat to the Galaxy, a ghost then emperor then a dead. Evil, the dark side is sometimes scary. As in EPVI, however, there is always room for minor characters who fight and subvert great powers. And the Jedi.<br /><br />The Jedi are all there but they cannot be seen. This time ABRAMS does not use a called easy ghost trick or visual Deus Ex Machina to save the situation. Only two boys, helping each other beyond the dark fate that the dark Sith Lord had prepared for them for his benefit. The scene of the Jedi voices encouraging Rey is so cool. As well as the subsequent defeat of evil.<br /><br />Adam Driver as Ben Solo steals the show for how credibly he changes his character is appropriate for both history and redemption theory. He is the son of Skywalker and Solo. Nice father / son relationship. Rey's life is more drawn, it turns out that he is Palpatine's grandson, but little else is known of the parents, except that they wanted to protect her .. her final choice to call herself ""Skywalker"" with her rebirth and final choice of the light side, a sign of gratitude to both Luke and Ben, put it in perspective to give new life to the good in the galaxy, perhaps with new Jedi to train ..<br /><br />It matters little that there are so many explanations why there had been none in SW (and thank goodness that some things remain unexplained .. Luke's sword .. Rey's parents okay are Palpatine's children but nothing else is said. .) and that the rhythm never softens from the tablet .. it is SW in light speed, which tries on the fly to apologize for some choices of Ep VIII and that sometimes self-activates too much.<br /><br />Crazy special effects, Leia has an important role and is treated with respect, the music is really at the highest point of synthesis and arrangement in the career (very long) of Maestro John Williams, who takes up and recreates many themes and uses them in a way unexpected.<br /><br />Many, I read, are not happy. Probably many don't write and they are. It is difficult to understand why we try so much to judge it as a film in its own right. Yes it is a saga with three opposing tones, with the last three being for sure ""more of the same"". Still the construction of the new characters in three films is valid, and the ending does not disappoint, even if, for the amount of everything that has been Star Wars until yesterday, it will not be able to satisfy everyone even and precisely because the producers aimed (in vain) to satisfy us all. So the advice is to find our moment, the one that pleases us most as a fan, there are many to choose from (mine is the medal to Chewbacca, the character that I have preferred most of the comeback), gliss on others that for us clash (and for others not) and live peacefully with this saga .. and may the force be with us.",1

The problem is that they put so much into it, they seem to get loss in providing a good movie that lines up with the original Star Wars. Many scenes don't make sense. For example, at one point Rey can stop a huge ship from taking off with her powers. Later she can barely climb up a part of the Death Star wreckage. I seriously had to force myself to watch this movie. Disney has progressively made Star Wars unwatchable. Marvel is heading down the same road. Disney, I beg you to stop this ideologically based movie writing you are on.

6634,1.0,"To Robert Iger, Kathleen Kennedy and J.J. Abrams - Rise of Skywalker is not beyond saving. The only way for you to get out of this mess is DVD/Blu-ray/Disney+ release with some changes (watch out! - spoilers): 1. In the first half of the movie give more room to breathe - it is fine that it is dynamic, just let those scenes actually have their impact. 2. Deus ex machina concept for the main plot twist ending 9 films is a narrative disaster - let the pressure grow throghout the film or at least tweak the scene when it is revealed - it does not have an impact in its current form. Maybe Palpatine could reveal it by himself like in ROTJ or at least make it more sophisticated by Ben. Let those scenes be powerful like Vader/Luke in ESB or Anakin's transformation in ROS. 3. CUT OUT THIS REY/BEN KISS. It is absurd! There is NO romantic relation between them throughout 3 movies - it ruins the climax!!!!!! 4. Revealing techniques of the Emperor at the very beginning in such a way was a waste of pressure potential. Make this reveal a shocker - build it up like point 2. 5. Let Hux die without more to it - the guy destoyed a few planets - he is a maniac, he should be neither funny nor collaborative.",0
6635,6.0,"One of the best star wars movies ever made. It isn't perfect, but it's epic. The final is emotional and satisfying. Please, don't read people opinions about this movie before you see it.

6636,9.0,"This film is not perfect. I MUST say that immediately. I will not pretend that every nuance is well thought out and perfectly planned. The story is a little lacking and I truly believe to execute this new trilogy, they needed to have a stronger idea of their narrative, goals and through-line. BUT....this is a Star Wars film that will not go down as being the worst or even close to a disgrace to the franchise.<br /><br />IF you liked Episodes 1-3: script, story, character arcs, narrative....this might not do it for you. I found each of the them to be more painful than the last. Episode 3 infuriates me because of the globbed together story and plot points that make NO SENSE. ""Force Awakens"" was great. I enjoyed the continuation in characters, story, and the script didn't make me cringe. ""Last Jedi"" wasted so much potential that THAT was what irritated me. I wasn't mad...just disappointed. It did raise some great plot points though and develop some fascinating ideas.<br /><br />RoS (to make things easier) expounds upon the best ideas and still doesn't deliver what we need, but in empowering ""certain characters"" we have a somewhat predictable, but emotionally moving finish to our epic saga of 9 films (spin offs not included, though ""Rogue One"" was inserted into the canon well). This was NEVER going to be the thing EVERYONE wanted. It was never going to be the Shakespearean epic like ""Empire"", but I am satisfied for the most part. Are there things I'd change? HELL YES....do I think this is 'painful', 'unwatchable', 'a mess' etc. Absolutely not. I am more satisfied now than I was at the end of 3, and that's saying A LOT.",0

It tried so hard to break away from the typical star wars movie, but it did it at the wrong time in the trilogy.<br /><br />The rise of Skywalker was a great attempt to bring it back and a really good ending to the whole series. I'm not sure it could have been done better.<br /><br />My one complaint is why they did not build a three movie storyline from day one. This series definitely feels like each movie was written on an island after watching the previous movie which is a horrible way to make star wars movies.",1
6648,9.0,Ignore the critics reviews. Clearly they don't understand what Star Wars is to it's fans and TLJ it wasn't it! JJ brings it back in for the fans they nearly lost to please critics. It corrects these stupid errors & is a great movie!,1

I am able to see the story JJ was wanting to tell when he started this journey with TFA and it would have been amazing had he had 3 movie to tell the tale. Sadly this film feels like a sequel to TFA with a lot of story missing between the two. This caused RoS to feel very rushed with many one liners included to try and ""fix"" issues from TLJ.",1
6652,6.0,Rey a clone of luke and leia by palpatine is that's why he believes his her grandfather of a skywalker. The reason why kilo burned down temple because he was not told about his sister. The reason Han left leia when he found out the truth of leia giving birth while away being training luke. How could palpatine exist he was destroyed by Dath Vader the chosen one which leaves one problem who could be the projection of emperor and snoke? Luke projected himself to fight kilo and died in The Last Jedi and when this film Palpatine died in the ends so does leia. So what does Rise of Skywalker mean the rise of Rey or does kylo rise and appear in next film as leia died kylo was reborn.,0
6653,10.0,"Bad thing bringing the emperor back.<br /><br />There was no need to correct everything that happened on episode VIII, the only thing that failed on that one was the Luke's role and character, but the rest was fine.<br /><br />Disney should have listened more to George Lucas but argh.<br /><br />It felt like my childhood died, and that's not bad, it was a good ending.<br /><br />Still original trilogy is top of the top.",0
6654,8.0,"Wow, soooooo much wrong here...",0
6655,2.0,I give it 9/10 because I consider that JJ Abrams - fulfill general expectations and made a good ending for the trilogy. The action is very intense - maybe a little unexplained from time to time (perhaps - some extended explanations was necessary). Probably they have in mind to explain further in series and movies to come. To better understand the episode 9 - it is necessary to watch Star wars - Clone Wars (animated series) and Star wars - Rebels.,1
6656,9.0,"I have never written a review before on IMDB but I felt like this was important. As a movie, Rise of Skywalker was good. Not great. Not bad. Just good. Take that was you will, which for most of you will mean it is a monumental letdown. For everyone else, I hope to to offer a different perspective.",1
6657,5.0,"I'll start with this. If youre looking for a good movie that has solid appeal and great fx, then you'll love it. Especially if not holding any lifetime expectations for the end of a nine part saga you grew up with.<br /><br />As a lifelong fan of Star Wars, and knowing full well going into it that it would not be what we yearned for, it still fell a bit flat as the closing act to a lifelong event.<br /><br />I wont trash the movie for the various reasons that will glare out at long time fans. But since the goal was to reach all the younglings and appeal to new fans/market, the final 3 movies make perfect sense from that perspective.<br /><br />But in all, its a prime example of ""be careful what you wish for"" even if only a child.<br /><br />Its not a bad film and JJ Abrams did a fine job with the toilet of a mess he was left to work with.<br /><br />But it's nowhere in the ballpark of what we longed for or deserve after all these years.<br /><br />Take it for what it is, and it's enjoyable enough.",0
6658,3.0,"The first twenty minutes of the film was horribly paced, so much had happen in the beginning and it felt very rushed, as time went on by the end of the first hour it started to pick up its pace and build on its plot. Of course the Star Wars saga has many fans including myself and not everyone will be pleased and wish for alternate endings and yes, I do think the ending could've been more thought out and developed better but overall I found it relieving. The film answers most of the stories questions that we have been waiting for it to answer. Of course through the 2 hours and 21 minutes of the film, there was some unneeded scenes and scenes that raised questions that were never answered. Which upset me considering that the film was completely changed during editing process and that there was supposed to be a different ending. In my opinion, if the film is titled The Rise of Skywalker, the ending should've concluded with Rey being dead and Ben being able to overcome it all and rise as the last jedi. He should've been the one to continue on and burry the two lighthtsabers at the end of the film which ultimately would've had more meaning considering that he is actually in the skywalker bloodline and it would conclude with him as the last skywalker OR keep the ending there is but with add a twist and something to keep the audience at the edge of their seats wanting more. For example, Instead if the ending scene when Rey holds up her own lightsaber which appears to be yellow, it should've been Red. Which would've raised so many questions and would've created a more intriguing conversation. But all thoughts and opinions aside, I think if you're a true fan, you are ultimately impressed with this conclusion to the trilogy. Besides the fact, that producer, Kathleen Kennedy is known to make the films not as good as they could be, I think this was exceptional but for future films I don't think she should have the most say in this story.",0

But as always, just see it for yourself. You be the judge!",0
6661,7.0,"I'm sure not everyone agrees but I thought this movie completed the story of Luke and Leia very nicely. Opinions will undoubtedly vary but it was just a movie folks. It is not life and death stuff. Just a movie series that started over 40 years ago. Of course, there are some parts left to for you to discuss, That is the strength of this entire story. Overall, the message I got was hope and love of friends and family. That, in my way of thinking, is a wonderful message.",1
6662,10.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is a great film. Certainly better than The Last Jedi. Throughout this film you are hit with nostalgia and will laugh at a few jokes. The final battle was an amazing fight scene. I love colors and cinematography for movies and I say this one was the best for that. I will admit there was some flaws. The first 45 min felt rushed. Lando was in it for 5 minutes. Every character besides Rey and Kylo were cast aside. And I think the part we're all of the ships flew in was kinda cheesy. I don't blame totally blame J.J Abrams for the flaws. He had a perfect plot set up but they switched directors and Rian Johnson turned the entire story around which J.J had to fix. I will admit though, J.J Abrams could've built off of the Last Jedi unlike him going off and doing his own thing. Overall with its flaws this movie is extremely good and I will not say the best but it's high on the list.",1
6663,1.0,"There movie was mediocre at best. Another example of how George Lucas just got lucky with the original and how Disney does what Disney does. Takes a classic, tries to fix what was broken, and ends up breaking it more. There is nothing about this movie that makes sense. The timelines are all screwed up, and characters made famous in the originals are completely negated with one character reveal today. WTF Disney. We understand you are trying to fix the atrocities the are the prequel movies, but this is your solution? At least make your story make sense. Better yet, you should have left well enough alone. If you want to make more Star Wars movies then do it like Rogue one. That was incredibly well done in my opinion and actually made you hate the empire and brought a true understanding of why Darth Vader was feared.

The fight scenes were the best yet between Jedi/Sith. Yes Kylo helmet was shattered as well but hey he could have put that back together:.. looks like there were some Sith style Crazy glue attached to it. The action was great it was a nice way of wrapping of the mega saga. Can't compare this one to the ones from 40 years ago. Each one of the trilogies were in fact in different eras. The ending was very good especially since she has the yellow saber which was last scene by Ahsoka.

There also were some inconsistencies (I remember reading somewhere other things about Poe's background than what was revealed during this film?) Also the last scene. Oh boy. It made me angry.<br /><br />All in all, I think this could have been a great trilogy. The ideas were certainly there, in all movies. What really killed it was the change of directors and the lack of a clear vision, in my opinion.<br /><br />So, I think it's worth watching because it has some really cool moments, some really great character development for Finn (I still can't believe I'm saying that), and John Williams' music is full of throwbacks, which really made it a much more enjoyable experience. I honestly can't comprehend how some people are giving the movie 1/10 reviews. (7.5/10 for me actually, but let's round it up)",0
6692,8.0,"I knew Snape would be good'un at the end, and loved how Harry defeated Voldemort & had control of both wands.",1
6693,1.0,"The movie was really good. Are there unanswered questions? Sure. Does everything make sense? Nope. I dont get the hate. People were making predictions after seeing the first one. Star Wars fans at that. Turns out, one of the major predictions was right. So what. When i watched the movie, i felt the same live i felt when watching the original trilogy. Something i didnt feel from the second. I felt an emotional tie to the characters, just like the first trilogy. Fans sometimes expect to much maybe. As far as canon Star Wars is concerned could this live up to anyones expectations? Good movie, glad i put time into watching it, and i will purchase it when it hits video",0
6694,8.0,I always read IMDB before venturing into the cinema and I did go in with little expectation and quite frankly was surprised how much I enjoyed it. You can argue about the Slightly meandering story line and the copy and paste plot but isn't that why we love this franchise so much?,1
6695,9.0,"Look, I get all the bad reviews. Some of them have some legit arguments. Could this have been split into several movies? Yes! Does this have a Star Wars feel like the originals? I feel like it does.",0
6696,10.0,"As a big Star Wars fan I went into this movie with high expectations. Also as an added bonus, I had friends with me, that have watched most or all movies mostly together with me in the past. So I will voice some of their opinions at the end too.",0
6697,7.0,Okay it's not a 10 but it's definitely not a 1.,0
6698,10.0,"This is the final chapter in the disappointing sequel trilogy, in this movie they jump haphazardly across the Galaxy in the most disjointed way possible, moving from set piece to set piece, half of the sets they visit are for nostalgia only. All the character development happens off screen, we are just told that it happened, and not shown any relationships actually developing. Also Rey continues to learn new Force Powers on the fly and be awesome at everything, primarily displaying one of only two emotions/expressions: detached or constipated. Kylo is the only character that attempts to bring balance to this movie, he actually struggles, unlike Rey, to overcome hardships and his own inner demons.",0
6699,3.0,"Just watched it. I avoided all reviews before watching and I'm glad I did, so much negativity out there! I've been a die hard Star Wars fan my whole life and this movie did not disappoint. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. What more can you ask for? I'm sure I'll pick it apart in the days to come and find things about that I didn't like, but all in all it was a very satisfying end of the saga. Will I watch it over and over again like I didn't the original trilogy? No, but I'm also not a kid anymore either. Just have fun and enjoy it!",1
6700,8.0,From the reviews we learned it wasn't very good. But my son and I were thrilled and enjoyed it very much. Being a fan from the first movies from the 70s I am happy about the 'new' movies 7-9 that all succeeded in bringing back the atmosphere from the old movies 4-6. The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting end of the series and it will surely end up in my movie collection.,1
6701,8.0,"Not the greatest film in the Saga, but it did a lot to try and complete the mangled story arc's from the last film.<br /><br />Some of the plot lines were forced into play by The Last Jedi.<br /><br />To say that one of the films main stars died before her story line could be finished, they did a pretty good job with the hand that they were dealt.",0
6702,7.0,"As a big Star Wars fan, this film was a disappointment. Poor storyline, dialogue & acting. The way they got in former characters was laughable. They seemed to throw in old Luke, R2D2, Han, Lando, & others just to please fans. I thought Jar Jar, Jaba, Yoda & Obi-Won would also appear to please fans .Too many light sabre fights got boring & predictable. Finn could use acting lessons.",0
6703,7.0,"I love star wars but i didnt see no different about ROS and TLK . Only the logo ""star wars"" help this movie",1
6704,3.0,"A great story ends witha a great end ,I love star wars very much😍😍",1
6705,10.0,"In my opinion, and it is just my opinion, there has been only been to date, ONE Star Wars movie to be released that has a great plot, brilliant writing, well produced, magnificently acted and most importantly felt like a true Star Wars movie since the release of the original three movies.... ROGUE ONE A STAR WARS STORY!!!!!",1
6706,2.0,"Disney, in 10 years from now, please redo this triology but this time make it good please!!!",0
6707,6.0,"This is the most Star Warsy Star Wars movie in the trilogy, the action and visuals were absolutely stunning but the story could have made a bit more sense if they put it into 2 movies",0
6708,8.0,"Possibly the best, if not one of the best, Star Wars movies ever. The Rise of Skywalker had me smiling with a grin from ear to ear. Thank you so much JJ Abrams for giving us such an honorable ending to one of our most beloved stories.",1
6709,10.0,"From someone who watched the original film in 1978, this one ticked the right boxes. Not perfect but after the previous film I worried that my star wars had been lost. So happy that jj abrams turned it around.",1
6710,9.0,"Out of any Star Wars movie, this is the one that's grown on me the most since I've watched it. When I first saw it, I had so many conflicting feelings about how it seemingly was at odds with The Last Jedi and even itself. I still enjoyed it, but I felt disappointed. With time, I've come to see that J. J. Abrams was just doing what he did with The Force Awakens. He made a film that harkens back to everything that makes Star Wars what it is, but at the same time he uses old to say something new. I also don't think this movie is meant to be a counter to The Last Jedi as much as it's perceived as being one. For one, the Rey and Kylo Ren dynamic in this movie entirely hinges on The Last Jedi. The romantic angle and the continued rejection of Kylo's hand are both things that carry on from the previous film. Luke's recommitment to the Jedi and his father's lightsaber are building off what Rian Johnson did in The Last Jedi's ending. The idea that anyone could be someone special isn't lost here either, Finn is confirmed to be force sensitive and that becomes critical to winning the final battle. I'll concede that changing Rey's lineage is entirely unnecessary, but I don't think it goes against the themes of The Last Jedi. I also forgive it a bit because Daisy Ridley is such an insanely talented performer and she sells what she's given. The filmmaking is on another level too. There's so many great long shots, both in action and in quieter scenes, and it makes for a movie that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The action is easy to follow, and innovative with the Dyad fight scenes. There isn't any performance in this movie that isn't spectacular. Adam Driver especially shines in this movie with a more restrained and mature portrayal of Kylo Ren and then a purely physical portrayal of Ben Solo. He manages to say everything about a character without saying more than a single word. John Williams is John Williams, and his score doesn't disappoint. In recent years, a blockbuster that's this well made just feels like a rarity so I appreciate the ones that do have a unique style and creativity more. This movie is a beautiful and messy homage to the Star Wars films before it.",1
6711,9.0,"Really enjoyable watch, but because the Last Jedi was so bad it seems like JJ had to get everything across to the audience as quickly as possible. The storyline wasn't what I expected it was going to be when I walked into the cinema but it really but the unexpected turns out to be great in this film! It felt like Star Wars! It's right up there with Empire Strikes Back.",1
6712,9.0,"A fantastic end to the saga and a superb addition to the wider Star Wars universe. I throughly enjoyed this latest adventure in a galaxy far, far away and can't wait for more future Star Wars movies. Many thanks to all the talented people that brought this latest movie to the silver screen.",1
6713,10.0,"Character Rey is so bad and it repeats the same story that Palpatine killed Skywalker again, which was the worst part repeating history. Rey is some kind of God achieving everything but she is boring and angry all the time.<br /><br />In reality Skywalkers are shamed that they are finished and someone is replacing their name. Pretty boring movie no plot just action here and there. I forwarded it a lot. Ending was bad as well.",0
6714,1.0,"Is this how the Skywalker Saga should've ended? Hell no. That being said, it could've been a whole lot worse. If you didn't like TLJ (like a normal person), and your sleep paralysis demon looks a lot like Rian Johnson (like mine does), then you will find TROS at least mildly enjoyable. JJ Abrams took the dumpster fire that was handed to him, and made an action packed and heart stopping thriller. It isn't perfect, but it answers all of the questions and ties up the jungle of loose ends. There are some unbelievable special effects, and some downright amazing scenes. The hodge podge of b and c level actors pull it together for their best performances of this confusing and sloppily written trilogy. I would compare the overall feeling of the movie to that of Return of the Jedi. Fast paced and action packed, with some plot holes that pickier fans will not get past. At least we can sleep peacefully knowing that the past can not be changed, and Disney seems to be moving in the right direction with their tv shows.",1
6715,8.0,This movie probably doesn't deserve a 10 but trying to balance out the 1s.,0
6716,10.0,100% not the best ending I've ever seen but thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Way to many geeks out there over analysing a very good movie. Should spend more time developing a personality than wanking over lightsabers. Grow up,1
6717,8.0,"For everybody who marked 1/10 - go screw yourself! That's a beautiful movie, yes, with some mistakes, but very close to ideal. We've got answers on almost than all questions, that 7&8 episodes stood. However, I was dissapointed but only by two moments. First, the final battle, and second, Metacritic score. I felt like a twelve-years-old, during all the movie. It's brilliant and I believe, will be appreciated by next fan generation. RIP Hux.",1
6718,10.0,"Haven't seen such a bad movie in ages. There's just no way to put it, watch it for yourself and you'll see how low Disney managed to bring down such a known franchise. It is utterly shameful to witness such a massive downfall.",0
6719,1.0,"So to understand this, you have to know my feelings before going into every movie of the new trilogy.<br /><br />Before TFA came out, I was hopeful that it would turn out good and feel fresh because the last additions to the Star Wars Universe were pretty nice (The Clone Wars mainly) but also feared that Disney would screw it up. And I was really disappointed when I found out that Disney, in fact, did and just remade ANH. The movie wasn't that bad but it brought nothing new to the universe.<br /><br />Before watching TLJ I was already expecting Disney to just remake TESB. After the movie I went out quite relieved and with some enjoyment of the movie which had really not too few flaws but came up with something new and seemed to disregard the boringness of the 7th one.<br /><br />But after some time, thinking about the movies, I just came to the conclusion that this isn't Star Wars anymore. They weren't terrible but they just lacked the feeling and the charm of it, 7 failed to mimick it and 8 didn't try at all.<br /><br />And with these thoughts I just went to see TROS out of obligation to a universe I once fell in love with and didn't expect too much.<br /><br />And, don't get me wrong, it wasn't nearly perfect, the beginning was a mess and Rey's Mary Sueing there really bothered me. Also there were some plot holes and weird film elements.<br /><br />But the rest of the movie really warmed up my heart. It wasn't really copying the older movies but payed tribute to them and introduced many new things and themes. Lando's return, the scenes with Luke, Han and Leia and the voices of known and dear Jedi brightened my mood and view on the new trilogy and the ending with Rey and Ben overcoming themselves with the epic battle in the background and, most importantly, the last scene on Tatooine with the two suns made me finally feel satisfied and happy with the new movies, relieved that it came to a nice ending and generally gave me a feeling of conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.",1
6720,8.0,"This film is fine, way better than last jedi and on par with the force awakens. with stunning visuals and a good story i'm sure this will go down with a cult following like revenge of the sith did.",1
6721,7.0,"The rating would perhaps be higher, taken as a single film. But in the context of the saga, it makes no sense and the story is concluded in a confusing and hasty manner.",0
6722,4.0,"Just got back from the cinema after seeing ROS and as my first review on IMDB I'm leaving this, based mainly on the trilogy as a whole but it could be on this stand alone movie.",1
6723,8.0,"I, like most people, love star wars. I'm not old enough to have seen the originals in their day. But I love the films and think each film is great in their own ways. (maybe not phantom). This film has great moments, action, surprises and emotional moments. To some extent I am very happy with it and I personally think it provides a somewhat fitting end to the Skywalker saga. The pacing of this movie isn't great, they've tried to fit a ridiculous amount of story into a couple of hours, and it just doesn't work very well. However it's a very enjoyable movie and provides a good amount of closure to the saga.",1
6724,7.0,"I really don't get the negative reviews for this film. It was very solid and at moments moved me to actual tears, something no other Star Wars movie has done. It covers a lot of ground which made me think the pacing was off on my initial viewing. But the second time I saw it the pacing was perfect.",1
6725,9.0,"Although there are several reveals in the plot which would seem rushed and how the development is lacking, the film is very entertaining. Extremely entertaining. There are many technical loopholes and other issues if you're the type of fan who focuses on that, but that's the thing, I am that type of fan but I ended up forgetting about them because of how entertaining the entire movie was.",1
6726,8.0,The movie was great! Story line went perfectly with the entire Star Wars saga. I'm not sure why someone would rate the movie a 2/10. They probably never watched any of the previous movies.,1
6727,9.0,OK... where to start?,0
6728,3.0,Brings small pieces from all previous 8 movies to close a Disney movie as close to a George Lucas film as possible,1
6729,9.0,"Forget the hate - this is one of the better Starwars films out there. It tells a different story, being largely free from mirroring the plot of any others. It uses the new cast better than previous outings. All the haters are over analysing a fairy tale. It hits undo on the Last Jedi - both the prettiest, and worst of all the Starwars films IMAO. And it wraps up the story... for now.",0
6730,8.0,"I have just seen the movie last night and thought it a very satisfying end of the Disney trilogy.<br /><br />Both Finn and Rey had a much better story arc than in the last Jedi and deservedly so .<br /><br />I Also could not shake a feeling that the movie echoed the British election and the Brexit revolution.<br /><br />Poe Dameron ( Boris Johnson) with the help of Rey (Dominic Cummings) ,Chewwy ( James Cleverly ) and C3PO (Jacob Rees Mogg) defeated the sinister Palpatine ( Jeremy Corbyn) General Pryde (John McDonnell) and Hux ( Dominic Grieve) .<br /><br />Palpatine using his insidious power to destroy the rebel alliance ( Tory Party) and keep it under the heel of the evil empire ( the E.U) , using the first order (the Labour Party) and their stormtroopers (momentum) to assist in their devilish deeds.<br /><br />But just when all hope was seen to be fading with Poe and Rey being thwarted at every turn a call went out to the Good people of the Galaxy (Great Britain) and the silent majority turned up in their millions to help the rebels stop the Empire , but they must remain alert as some of the first order survived ( Porter ,raynor,Phillips,Thornberry and of course Abbott the Hutt).<br /><br />Others were involved in this thrilling finale are:-<br /><br />Finn ... Brendan O'Neill<br /><br />Leia ...Teressa May .<br /><br />Lando ... Nigel Farage .<br /><br />Zorii Bliss ... Priti Patel.<br /><br />Maz Kanata ....Ann Widdecombe .<br /><br />Kylo Ren .... Tom Watson .<br /><br />First order officers ... Cooper ,Soubury,Thornberry,Long-Bailey, Phillips and Bercow.<br /><br />Resistance officers ...Caroline Flint , Tim Martin , Douglas Murray , Tom Harwood , Richard Tice and isabel Oakeshott.<br /><br />Life imitating art ? I think so.",1
6731,9.0,I loved it. Sometimes it's hard to end something you loved for so long. There's no perfect ending to anything but they came as close as I could imagined.,1
6732,10.0,"This film has been criticised for been jam packed with nostalgia, with people describing it as a fan service. I whole heatedly agree with these reviews because nostalgia and fan services were absolutely necessary to create such a great film",1
6733,9.0,"The sequel trilogy started off strong, but The Last Jedi sort of tripped things up. It would have been a cool standalone movie, but the only thing it accomplished was to make it nearly impossible for ANYONE to finish the story properly. That, and the loss of Carrie must have set up a nearly insurmountable job for this movie to achieve.",1
6734,9.0,"Honestly, i was supremely concerned when i glanced through the initial ratings online. But man were my fears proven wrong or what!? The Rise of Sky walker has to be the an ending the fans deserve. The plot accelerates with relentless intensity whilst serving its age old fans with a generous garnish of star wars nostalgia! As i left the theater, i felt a great sense of closure as well as satisfaction! Thanks for this J.J. and the entire team! Couldn't have asked for anything better!",0
6735,10.0,WOW! I kind of hated the last few movies and only barely liked the second set with Hayden Christensen. etc. But this one brings it all home. It was all that any fan of the original trilogy could dream of and a hundred times more. I went in hopeful and came out excited for the future. They brought Star Wars back from the brink. Incredible job. Wow. There are so many 'gifts' in the movie for fans of the original trilogy that I literally lost count of them all. This is one Star Wars movie that begs to be watched again and again. And isn't that what the original was all about? You could not get enough. Star wars!,1
6736,10.0,"Not as bad as you think, actually is kind of cool, the best of the last 3, and worthy to belong to the Star Wars trilogy.<br /><br />Satisfying, could be better?, Yes, but is great.<br /><br />Nice effects, ""complex"" twist, good soundtrack.<br /><br />I recommend you to go and watch it.",1
6737,10.0,"Having been a fan of the first movie trilogy set, which I saw when I was 11, in '77 -19 times from the beginning man.",1
6738,5.0,"If you aren't old enough to say you were in a first run theater when you heard Vader say, ""I am your father"", then you probably lack the ability to enjoy the Star Wars ride regardless of where it takes you. That reveal had to be experienced in real time, the greatest and most controversial plot twist of the original trilogy.",1
6739,9.0,Good: Woman is thin/Luke,0
6740,4.0,Don't let critics deceive you. They fixed the mess that was the last movie Enjoy the movie!,0
6741,7.0,"After defending the new trilogy for these last few years, I was utterly disappointed in this final installment. In fact, I was insulted. The producers seem to think very little about the fans of the franchise and they didn't try to hide it.",0
6742,6.0,Everything I could have asked for to end the saga! Enjoyed it from start to finish!!! Go see it for yourself and make your own mind up. Ignore the the 1/10 reviews which is a ridiculous rating to give a film anyway.,1
6743,10.0,The characters if you can even call them that are constantly changing motives and the main plot has as many holes as Swiss cheese,0
6744,3.0,It really was a great movie. I know there could have been done more but it really was a great movie. I got a lot of chills trough my spine on multiple moments and even a tear at the end. Also a great set up for a new trilogy down the line! Can't wait!,1
6745,7.0,"If Force Awakens was a star wars movie by JJ Abrams and The Last Jedi was a Star Wars movie by Rian Johnson (both who had had critically and commercially excellent careers) then this is definitely a star wars movie by the guy who wrote Batman Vs Superman and Justice League. It's a sloppy, unintelligible mess of a film that detracts from the two masterfully constructed films that preceded it, and renders what could've been a trilogy worthy to the star wars name a waste of the last 5 years.",0
6746,5.0,"I think what ruined it was there was no Continuity between all 3 movies, it's a good Star Wars movie but as a saga you could tell the was no set direction",1
6747,6.0,"This whole trilogy could have been so much better, I feel as a whole trilogy the storyline was all wrong.<br /><br />This film was the end of a trilogy, the end of the Skywalker era and yet you still meet BRAND NEW characters!<br /><br />Some scenes were just beyond crazy that didn't need to happen and left me feeling very frustrated.<br /><br />I don't understand why this film was called 'Rise of Skywalker'.<br /><br />I remember being younger and loving the lightsaber duels but they have been pointless in this film with no meaning or outcome at the end.<br /><br />Very few good moments in this film but outweighed by the many bad. It just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. As much as I wanted to like this film I have to say I don't like Star Wars as much as I did after episodes 1-3 now because of this trilogy!",0
6748,4.0,"I just had to reply, I'm getting really sick and tired of all those mindless haters here. They call themselves Star Wars fans, they are not. They can't see a good movie, even when it hits them in the face. I LOVED number 9. It was a true SW film. I don't care what all those haters say, I loved it and that's what counts for me!!!!",1
6749,9.0,"Few things to get out of the way first:<br /><br />1- If you're looking for a fully matured adult movie, this isn't it. This is Star Wars!<br /><br />2- Some scenes don't work as well as others to the point of being ridiculous. But then again, this is Star Wars!<br /><br />With that being said- I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I strongly suspect when I finish processing I will still feel this is very likely the best of the sequels. The movie plays excellent tribute to the past while being an exciting adventure itself.<br /><br />I truly felt like a kid again and it's the type of movie I'm excited for other kids to see. To feel the wonder I felt when I first experienced Star Wars. Some say there's too much fan-service but to be honest I loved every second of it.<br /><br />These movies have been quite the rollercoaster and I want to congratulate everyone for sticking the landing. Almost all of the characters are at their very best in this movie. The relationships and the story come full circle.",1
6750,8.0,Not Good. Nice final battle and an Excellent performance from Emperor Palpatine earn it a few brownie points.,1
6751,7.0,A lot better... like 1000 times better than Last Jedi.... So I'll give it 2! :D.,1
6752,2.0,"George Lucas had a different ending in mind but disney didn't think is profitable enough. A great story ruined by corporate marketing decisions. Driver made a almost perfect appearance, as for the others... I even forgot their names. In conclusion I think we all miss jar jar. Heck even jar jar sith lord sounds better than miss Emperor.",1
6753,7.0,Okay so let's start by saying that the movie is a lot of fun it's got a lot of action and fast moving adventure it makes the hours seem like minutes almost but I do say that I loved it just get some snacks,1
6754,9.0,"My only major complaint about the film is that the first act (especially the first 15-20 minutes) feels hugely rushed. The pacing is jarring. It's like actors run into frame, deliver lines, then find/do whatever they need to advance the story, then run back out.",0
6755,10.0,"Its amazing that so many Reviewers are dissapointed. They expect a religious epiphany. But ist just a Movie, a fairytale. Ist always has been. And this one is true to this original idea. Its Entertainment. And that it is: Great Story telling. Lovely figures that one can love. Great Music..the big pictures on the big screen are awesome. Very Star warsy<br /><br />Go and enjoy it",1
6756,9.0,"Great movie, don't pay attention to the haters. Will be seeing it again for sure",1
6757,10.0,"I enjoyed having more of 3PO & Chewie. I enjoyed how Carrie Fisher's last footage was utilised. I enjoyed getting to know more about Poe & Finn (though, that should have happened in TLJ). I enjoyed the corrections made to fix TLJ. I enjoyed the tie up of 'the saga'. Rey's family lineage reveal was probably not even necessary to the plot tbh but hey, it's not the worst idea in Hollywood either. It did feel a bit rushed (although there was a lot needed to fix TLJ and tie up saga) but I enjoyed the ride!! (Might help if you've rewatched Ep 1-8 recently too, as I had). I think more kudos/praise should be given to J.J. for saving the trilogy after TLJ & losing Carrie Fisher. Well done and thanks.",1
6758,6.0,"Saw the movie with my kids and they were enthralled and thoroughly entertained by the movie, as was I. Complex, masterfully, beautiful and nostalgia ridden. Well done JJ Abrams.",1

6764,8.0,"Star Wars is supposed to be a fairy tale, and fairy tales have happy endings. in this movie, the heroine has to see her soulmate die in front of her eyes after he gave his life to bring her back. Ben Solo lived a life of abuse and manipulation and he died forgotten by his own family. In this movie, the villain wins. The Skywalkers are all gone while a Palpatine has their entire legacy and name. there's nothing ""satisfying"" ot ""hopeful"" about this movie. it's just a straight up tragedy",0

6775,3.0,"This movie did so much justice to the series. Yeah sure, if we wanna get critical with it, it's kinda clunky. But that's coming from an ADULT point of view. Looking at this movie from your inner child's point of view... it was FANTASTIC 😍😍😍",1
6776,10.0,"When I first watched Rise of Skywalker, I thought it was just ok. I had seedlings of problems with the film, but they were small enough to where it didn't kill the film. However, after letting the film sit for a while and rewatching the first 8 films, those seedlings have grown into substantial issues that big the entire film down. Before I go into more detail, let me get these two things out of the way. 1: Disney clearly had no idea where this trilogy was going, and so a lot of my problems can be blamed on Disney rather than JJ or anyone else who worked on this movie. 2: I liked the Last Jedi. Not because it was an amazing movie, but because it kept me invested. The twists and turns, while maybe not the best decision for the series in the long run, made me wanna keep watching to see what happens next. The overall climax was epic in every sense of the word. The film was just interesting, which is something I cannot say about Rise of Skywalker. In short, my main problems with ROS are that it felt like a fan fiction, contradicted almost every Star Wars film, and was poorly written and boring. As stated before, it was clear Disney didn't know what they were doing, but I think JJ had a plan. I believe that JJ was setting up something with Force Awakens. However, Disney handed the wheel over to Rian, who then steered JJ's plan way off track. But, when the backlash to Last Jedi came in swinging, Disney gave the wheel back to JJ and said, ""Fix this please."" So, JJ used ROS to repair the damage Last Jedi caused. Which wouldn't be a problem, if that wasn't the only thing ROS felt like it did. To me, it feels like ROS leans to heavily into the ""fix Rian's mistakes"" camp, rather then the ""conclude this trilogy well"" camp. This fix it mentality is also what makes ROS feel like a fan fiction. What I mean by that, is that it seems like the whole movie was written by an upset fan after the Last Jedi. This does not bode well for the movie, as it makes the writing feel messy and not like a Star Wars movie. Speaking of Star Wars movies, this film contradicts and rejects multiple ideas from the previous movies via its most heinous addition: Emperor Palpatine lives. You see, there was this great moment in Revenge of the Sith where Palpatine tells Anakin the story of how Darth Plagueis was murdered by his apprentice. ""Ironic."" Palpatine says at the end of the the tale. This was a great moment because we know that Palpatine also dies to his own apprentice! Except he doesn't because ROS said so! Also the prophecy and many other lines about Anakin defeating the sith are completely butchered by this decision. Honestly, this single choice kills the movie for me now because I can't watch the first 6 films without being reminded that there lines are rendered pointless. Finally, I just thought the film was a boring string of fetch quests, which is just bad writing. I don't have as much to say about this point, it's pretty self explanatory. Overall, this film is a mess and is constantly struggling to both end this trilogy in a satisfactory way and answer fan complaints about the Last Jedi.",0

6785,9.0,"You're going to read a lot of reviews on this movie that states that it is horrible. Poor plot, special effects, cinematography, character development, etc. etc. Ignore all of these and go and see the movie for yourself. That is what I did, and you know what? I was pleasantly entertained! The plot was excellent and kept you involved in the story for the entire length of the movie. The special effects drew you in and made you truly believe that blaster bolts and lightsabers are a thing of reality, instead of fiction. Rey's development as a Jedi, and Luke's guidance of her were priceless, and made me want to see more! I can't wait until this movie is released on digital so that I can have a full-length, Episodes I-IX marathon! Thank you for reading and May the Force be with you!",0
6786,9.0,"I really don't understand how anyone could hate on this movie. I totally agreed with everyone regarding The Last Jedi, which did not contribute any meaningful elements to the story in my opinion, but, this one? I think J.J. did an amazing job wrapping everything up!",1
6787,8.0,"The headline says it, this was just a fan servicing attempt to fix something they had screwed up. I say this because much like the force awakens there was no real story, just rehashed elements from the originals and too many predictable moments that added to the wasted opportunity to take star wars to new heights.",0
6788,9.0,"My eight year old only ""liked"" it. That's very surprising as he always LOVES every movie. I ended up on my phone midway (of course the screen was at its darkest setting...) The last scene where everyone was kissing to celebrate their (ridiculous) victory based on destroying a ridiculously sized fleet with pea shooters (note: which also included two women kissing for obvious PC rhetoric) showed to me that writers had run finally out of ideas and respect for the franchise, Thankfully, it's the end of Star Wars as I knew it and it can now peacefully descend into the spiral of never ending and meaningless reboots. Farewell, old friend. Sorry to see that your parents were unable to keep your dignity until the end. At least the force of good story telling will be with us in the DVD box set. Forever.",1

6792,4.0,The Rise of Skywalker was a solid piece of cinema. The storyline was great and it had many surprising plot twists. Disney finished their story well and what can be said about the current hate from fans is that it was clear from the beginning that star wars fans were not going to like it since they have so unrealistically high expectations.,1

6798,10.0,"I loved this movie. It gift wrapped 42 years and countless adventures in a fitting - if a little frenzied - climax. But it's as polarizing a movie as the battle of Jedi versus Sith. Not many out there are scoring it in the middle.There's love for it. And hate. For me, for the genius weaving of Leia into this finale and her poignant swansong, total respect to everyone who brought this and four decades of joy to my world...Love Star Wars, love this.

6801,9.0,"The final episode of the ""Skywalker Saga"" turned out to be part of the ""Palpatine Saga"". Nevertheless the biggest problem of the movie is the whole final act, where it fails to emotionally involve the viewers. At that point everything gets very trivial and far from the star wars concept of the importance of feelings and intelligence. It's simply a matter of the use if magic, as we have never seen before and never wanted to, probably. As now the force is good for teleporting objects, reviving dead bodies and fight from a distance. About fights sometimes it's very hard to understand what the fight is about.<br /><br />The first half of the film doesn't fail so much in consistency as the second one, but sadly is a little too focused at retconing episode 8 and fast paced. Let's hope they will let star wars rest in peace now that they violated it for the last time.",0
6802,10.0,"OK,<br /><br />Waited for this movie for 5 years god damn it<br /><br />And...<br /><br />👍<br /><br />This movie is a nice conclusion to this amazing story.<br /><br />The start was great, Rey training is cool.<br /><br />The lightsaber that Rey used was destroyed in The Last Jedi, so did Rey rebuild it or did they just forget this detail?",1

6805,9.0,"I am upset that Anakin and other force ghosts did not appear during a scene (besides their voices) which Disney could have used to their advantage for a complete finish. Along with this, Rey changed her last name to Skywalker instead of keeping her real surname. Which is also a disappointment to me. Also, Kylo and Rey seem as they aren't aware that Darth Vader turned to the light side nearing his death, which I find to be important. However, the film shows characters from the original trilogy and it leaves viewers feeling nostalgic, its an amazing way to end a legacy of films. The visuals of the film and character development from Kylo Ren were phenomenal. A must watch regardless of how you feel about the sequels!",1
6806,10.0,"An excellent end to the saga. I was laughing, smiling, tearing up, edge of my seat, or jaw dropped the entire film. This is what Star Wars does best, a fun blockbuster space opera.",1

6810,8.0,"This is a non-spoiler review. This is a fast paced, action packed end to the saga. It was never going to be possible to please everyone, especially the Star Wars community which has become split since the sequels were launched. For those who complained the last Jedi was to radical, the Rise of Skywalker will work for you, but those who complained the Force Awakens was just a retread, this will also work for you. If you want rousing swashbuckling entertainment with a great character arc, then sit down and let yourself be transported for one final time to a galaxy far, far away.",1
6811,10.0,I enjoyed them film. I would highly recommend!!!!!!!,1
6812,8.0,Forget all the negative reviews there was few bumps along the way but the ending nailed it couldn't of been better the heart of the original 3 was embodied in the final part. Rey's and Ben's storyline achieved there arc perfectly and all the other characters Poe Finn and importantly Leia had solid finishes. Definitely the best Star Wars film since the originals loved it. The trilogy may not be perfect but rise of skywalker makes the trilogy come good in the end.,1
6813,10.0,"I am an old time fan of Star Wars back to the 70s I really enjoyed the movie I think it had a bit of everything, while keeping the spirit on of the force ,the drive to put your conscience and your will above all else.

6819,10.0,"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid. I grew up on the original trilogy, and my parents were fans before I even came along. In recent years I've grown dismayed by the wrath that so many other Star Wars fans have vented on not just the prequels, but especially the new trilogy. In fact, the venom others have expended on these films has left me feeling very frustrated; in a story arc this big, spanning over 40 years and with so many flavors (from Clone Wars to The Clone Wars to Rebels to Rogue One to IV, to II, to IX) you just can't please everyone. But the hatred is just shocking.",1
6820,9.0,"After the immense backlash that The Last Jedi received, I was iffy on how this would turn out. Even though I enjoyed Last Jedi I was aware of its flaws. Rise of Skywalker had me on the edge of my seat for nearly the entire film. The beginning of the film admittedly had some pacing issues, but they went away fairly quickly. The film itself is an immense roller coaster of emotions that any true Star Wars fan will love.",1
6821,9.0,"Okay, is there a lot happening? Are there too many 'little set pieces'? Probably. But, it is still worth seeing. Is it fun to watch? Hell, yes!",1

6824,4.0,"Poor storytelling, awful characterization, and futile attempts to please everyone that unfortunately hurt the film a lot.<br /><br />It's nice to see the old characters, but if their roles and dialogues are attractive enough, not just as a support for the new characters.",0

6826,6.0,Hail from true Mr. Disney And Mr. Abrams fan,1
6827,2.0,"Many comments on here seem to be from people claiming to be fans yet missing the details of earlier films in the 3 trilogies. Many of their complaints and incorrect assumptions have been addressed and have been closed out quite nicely. This is a very entertaining story which does tie in with Anakin and Luke's stories and leaves few, if any, questions that need an answer for me. Maybe those people aren't thinkers and requires crayons for explanation.",1
6828,,".<br /><br />My most anticipated movie of the year it's finally here and I just got home so this is a complete fresh review without any edit and spoilers , it was very enjoyable but the way movie goes was too fast imo and at the 1st half of the movie when a charecter was in the danger I didn't feel it cuz I saw most of those scenes in the trailer, but the 2nd half got more dark and emotional I really enjoyed the 2nd half.<br /><br />I don't know if all of the fans are going to enjoy this cuz a lot of fans love the originals or prequels and some like the new ones it's hard to say everyone would like it needs some times to some of the fans appreciate it but I enjoyed the most of it especially the ending I think it was epic and amazing and the action scenes are awesome, it's almost a new experience<br /><br />I don't know how exactly I feel about it I have to rewatch it but overall it was good with a lots of fan service and I'm glad that jj fixed luke, rose and Finn charecters before finishing this saga. I don't have so many problems with the rise of the skywalker but i think it should've been longer like 3 hours or more because most of the things in this movie especially in the 1st half happened so quickly without some setup or anything . This movie have some issues but also it warmed my eyes in some scenes and at the end I'm glad that it's over I think the ending was absolutely beautiful imo. It was a crazy journey I have so many memories with this epic trilogy I like to thank everyone behind these movies even the worst ones , and big thank you to George Lucas the man behind the skywalker trilogy. I'll miss these charecters so much but they'll always stay in my heart. May the force be with you and have a great day<br /><br />Final score: 7.9/10 (this score may change after the second viewing)",1
6829,9.0,Greetings from Serbia..land far far away! :)<br /><br />Dont read reviews..Just go and see the movie..<br /><br />Some questions are unanswered..some are..<br /><br />In short..Near epic ending of saga..<br /><br />Me like IT very much! :))))),0

Between ""lightspeed skipping"" from 1 planet to another, cheesiest saber fight scenes, or the randomness of 1 scene to the next, this movie is a non-stop laugh riot in its absurdity...

Many scenes felt reminiscent of it.<br /><br />This aside, the movie is very enjoyable to watch. I ended up enjoying Fin's character throughout the movie. This should have been his character from the start.<br /><br />Star Wars Rise of Skywalker is well done. JJ should have directored The Last Jedi, at least then the saga would have felt like a Star Wars Saga.",0

Some bigger, some less important, but all of them are worth talking about.",0
6837,8.0,"This didn't even feel like a Star Wars film it honestly felt like a fan fiction that got a really high budget. The whole film is just a scavenger hunt for the way finder to get to the emperor and then when it's found it gets destroyed. All that searching all that time wasted WASTED!!!! It was all for nothing!!!! Then don't even get me started on the force teleportation power THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A THING IN STAR WARS and then BOOM it's a thing that's now how story telling works you don't just add some insane new power with NO explanation on how it works or happens! This film just wasn't any fun either it was just a series of ""GO HERE!!!"" They got there ""NOW GO HERE!!!"" And the emperor being back was dumb that was honestly Abrams going ""OH NO!!! Rain killed my Gillian what do I do... I KNOW BRING THE EMPEROR BACK!!!"" It was very lazy writing and I'm not gonna talk about Thai a lot but this film wanted to be Avengers Endgame so bad and it was so obvious the whole ""I am all the sith!!!"" And then ""and I... am all the jedi!!!"" Was just them trying to be endgame and it was so painfully obvious. And while I'm on the final battle with the emperor. IT WAS SO UNDERWHELMING!!!! It was the most underwhelming third act I've even sat through it was so bad I mean he just goes ""POWER!!!!!"" Shoots some lighting then he tries to lighting strike Rey and she blocks it and what do you think the EMPEROR would do in this situation I'll tell you what I think he'd have done if he was written well. He'd go ""oh she's blocking my lightning like how Made Windu did maybe I should stop doing that."" And then he stops lighting striking Rey. BUT NO!!!! He keeps going and he just lets himself get killed. Like what the flip!!!!! He literally let him self die I'm telling you watch it again and watch how he is in the scene of his death he could have easily stoped lighting striking Rey but he lets himself die. That's as long as I'm writing for The Rise of Skywalker was a messy film and was boring and not fun and I did not like it... But the emperor said ""Dew it"" so 10/10.... I'm kidding 5/10 and 5 is generous 4 out of those 5 points is just cause he said ""dew it!!!"" Anyway thanks for attending my Ted talk.",0

The film starts off fast and doesn't really let up much, the action scenes are incredible and all actors were incredible. It's not an excellent Star Wars film but it's a great one. I much preferred it to TLJ and would give it a solid 8.5/10.",1

6844,10.0,"So pls ignore all 1/10 reviews they are just beyond crazy this is a good film but that is the problem it is only good at best. The reason for my review title this seems to have copied the flo of the original trilogy very good first film, superb 2nd average third I wish rian Johnson had directed this film to carry on the exciting new story developments he had created in last Jedi. As soon as jj was back on episode 9 you knew this would be a safe film not willing to be daring like last Jedi and empire this was going to be more like force awakens and return of the Jedi. Certain sections of the fandom unfortunately ruined any chance of the third film being anything other than the formulaic film we ended up with, and shame on jj and the producers for bowing down to the section of the fandom who couldn't cope with doing something different in last Jedi. So no spoilers here go and watch it there are some really good things in it and I hope you enjoy it more than a 6/10 score but I just wish they'd ignored the haters and made the film that last Jedi had set it up to be this could have been A masterpiece, unfortunately average - good at best is how it all ends, sad really. Merry Christmas!",1

6847,10.0,"Honestly, I agree with some of the reviews which state that there are some major flaws in the movie, an example being that apparently Leia was always a jedi apprentice in secret.

6850,6.0,"A pity that this film wants to please fans instead of offering something challenging. The previous episode left too many questions and the answers in this movie instead of being impressive, they end up being a glimpse into the past but with a lousy handling of the story being repetitive, just as The Force Awakens was. The development of the characters is poor since instead they exalt them for this closure, they end up being illogical and flat to have illogical motivations, meaningless situations or worse, some leave them without conclusion. This has been a disastrous trilogy where no chapter could be connected by the previous one and the mistake was to please an audience instead of bothering to tell a new and progressive story through its filmmakers.",0
6851,9.0,"Nitpicking a movie from start to finish because it isn't what fanboys conjure up in their head is ridiculous.

The plot moves at lightspeed. The action is INTENSE. I was on the edge of my seat with my jaw in my lap for the majority of the film. As predictable as the plot ends up being, every choice is so satisfying, I could find few complaints. The only considerable depreciation in plot development I felt was with the forced bits of depth/ backstory added onto Poe with his masked former spice liason, and Finn's new confidante found in a fellow Imperial-turned-rebel orphan. It was as if JJ was struggling to retcon a blooming romance with more traditional, cisgendered love interests, when Finn and Poe so obviously want each other.<br /><br />Apart from that, this major retread of Return of the Jedi felt so amped up and exciting, I really didn't care that it was an amped up and exciting retread of Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />Start to finish, the best time I've had at the movies since Fury Road.<br /><br />One coda of regretful criticism is that the final scene did leave enough evidence to (hopefully unintentionally) imply that Rey was an incestuous love child of Luke and Leia, which kind of gives the whole saga a weird vibe in retrospect.",1
6859,8.0,"The Rise of Skywalker is... a lot. The movie tries to please fans with nostalgia and action, while also answering the questions from the previous two films, trying to undo things from The Last Jedi, introduce new characters and worlds, and even bring back Palpatine. It's a lot to cope with, and for the first 45 minutes, the movie felt all over the place and I felt lost.",0
6860,7.0,"What is wrong with Star Wars fans? Whinge and complaining since Episode 1 came out... so funny now reading comments defending eps 1 - 3! The real reason for the negativity is they have pre conceived ideas on what they the final film to be, then when it's something different, they leave annoyed. On top of that, they're pissed that it's the last SW film of the franchise so they take their tears out on the last film.",0
6861,7.0,..for the best saga in the universe. I recommend watching it.,1
6862,8.0,"To be honest, I really think J.J. Abrams tried his best to fix Star Wars. And therefore, there must be some consequences.<br /><br />But when you know the reason behind, parts of them are forgivable...",1
6863,10.0,"Absolutely loved this movie. JJ took the agenda - ridden woke garbage that Rian Johnson created and fixed the problems...and wouldn't you know it. Decided To create a Star Wars movie that was about Star Wars and it's characters. He only added one tiny spoonful of alphabet soup. But I'm sure someone in that community will be in outrage that there wasn't more ""representation"". Ugh!!! The Rise of Skywalker was great! Made me laugh. Made me cry and sometimes uncontrollably. But I won't add any spoilers. Thanks for this mister abrams. The real fans thank you.",1
6864,8.0,Star Wars has been a part of my life forever...as I'm sure it has for many of you reading this. It brought me back to being a kid again...the joy of seeing Luke's X-wing. The Millennium Falcon in all its glory. Finding out Reys connection to the force and seeing how strong she is with it was satisfying. Loved the movie and it was definitely better than the Last Jedi.,1
6865,9.0,"The conclusion to the Skywalker saga is a truly satisfying one for fans. The movie, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is the grand finale of the large cinematic production of Star Wars spanning over 40 years, and the movie delivers a fantastic close to the nine film arc. Some critics would argue that there is too much consideration of the fans and not enough focus on the storytelling, but I disagree. The film's storyline stays more true to the roots of Star Wars mythos and falls more in line with the story's set-up in The Force Awakens than the jettisoned eighth installment, The Last Jedi. It goes in a predictable direction in the right areas such as the ultimate good versus evil storyline, but it provides unexpected surprises in a lot of areas as well. The movie manages to pay homage to so many great moments from the originals while not feeling overcrowded. It also ties up great moments from the sequel trilogy between Luke, Han, and Leia and the new heroes. The moments that seemed ruined by The Last Jedi's disconnected storytelling are salvaged by J.J. Abram's. Also, the fact that they used old footage of Carrie Fischer instead of computer generating her is a very impressive feat. The return of the villainous emperor is a great addition to the story and does not seem forced but is rather well explained. Overall, it's a grand and exciting adventure that serves as a fulfilling conclusion to the Skywalker saga that has been loved by generations.",1
6866,9.0,"Honestly, some people are too picky and want to rant about everything.. as a film, it's great. As a finish to the trilogy of trilogies, it works, gives closure and without spoilers reins in The Last Jedi and (I think) undoes the damage that did. Is it as special as episodes IV, V or VI? No. But I don't think films could be. What was achieved then was so brand new and touched a generation. More than one. But this film did all the right things and stirred up all the right emotions. I felt closure, even if I am sad the original 3 couldn't have done it.. Do stay clear of spoilers though.. Really essential. some really awful reviews from ""fans"" after the critics were really positive.. I was 6 years old when I saw Star Wars, fell in love with it, the characters, the whole thing.. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were massive as a young boy growing up.. I read all the movie magazine's, comic books etc.. Wasn't mad keen on the second trilogy, it had some good and some bad. Some characters were good, others awful, too much cgi, pretty ordinary casting for some, excellent for others.. Was so excited about the final trilogy, really enjoyed The Force Awakens with one major crap event by killing off my childhood hero. The events after that were a bit weird too the way there was no big reaction to it.. The Last Jedi.. Hmmm.. It did have some good bits.. but not all that many. Some of it was just plain crazy.. It ranks in my bottom 2, lets put it that way. This last one is a good film, it has a Star Wars feel. It works. If anyone has the right to be a critic it's someone from my/our generation and I'm not going to write hate about this film for no reason. Like I said, none will be as good as the original 3. Even George Lucas tried too hard to tweak them and did more harm than good. 3 words. Han. Shot. First. 😉",1
6867,8.0,I guess this is exactly what you get when you go to see the end of a trilogy that's driven by feminism/diversity agenda instead of you know..an actual story.,0
6868,9.0,Did you sell your SW world to Disney. It's not SW i watched 43 years ago. But if you watched all the SW movies you have to watch this one also. It's not bad but it has too much Disney in it. I hope this one was the last one and JJ will create his own SW world. That would make sense to me.,1
6869,5.0,"I would like to start on a positive note, I think visually this movie is very interesting and the effects are superb. I also thought Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley genuinely put in their all (even if they weren't given much to work with). The soundtrack is also decent (but for John Williams it's kinda a let down).",0
6870,7.0,This movie was trash. No I'm not a angry fan boy but I'm a huge fan of the lore and etc of star wars. Visually good film story and vision not even close. JJ did ok building a story from nothing but proves that no vision from the start was set. Regardless who's fault it was the force awakens was a cheap rip off and wasn't very good in my opion. The last Jedi made no sense and destroyed character development and made no sense in the trilogy. This film is rushed and thrown together for a quick buck. I wish I followed my gut feeling and didn't see this film fooled me twice Disney it will be hard to get me to come back. New stories are needed respect the lore and stop making out that star wars fans are just toxic wake up or watch your fandom disappear,0
6871,3.0,"Loved star wars since I was 10, like loved it. The last Jedi killed my dreams. Kind of made me question life. This film made up for the lack of depth the fans needed to see from Episode 8. To a Star Wars fan it makes sense. Seeing Palpatine again in action since episode 3 made it. There is things they could have done better for the deep fans though. Like bring anakin back as a force ghost or Obiwan Kenobi (Ewan). But it was an ending I loved and closed off the Sith.",1
6872,2.0,"Been there in 1977. Never left. This is the best we could hope for given recent deceptions. So just go in without expectations, the sage is yours and let no one take that from you. Indeed you 50+ out there - it is still with you.",1
6873,8.0,"I really liked the movie because it gave me a real star wars feeling again. The last jedi didn't give me that feeling. Pleas people, watch this movie without looking at the critics and you will have a good time. The only thing I can say is that this movie has so many plots bug I liked it this way. The nostalgia in the rise of skywalker is so nice. Fans will be so happy.",1
6874,8.0,"Ok, so first ever review. First this is where I'm at. Loved the original trilogy, like the prequels, liked TFA, hated TLJ. Just couldn't get on board with it. I understand that's not everyone's opinion, but there it is.",1
6875,9.0,"JJ delivers it moves it looks sounds and best of all feels great. It has real heart brings the new characters to different levels but has plenty of the original cast to connect the whole series together.<br /><br />As to some of the complaints I have read I do not agree with them at all, very solid film, but go see it and make up your own mind, its a great spectacular ride.",1
6876,8.0,"Sorry naysayers, I enjoyed this! Sit down, put your preconceived notions aside and enjoy the ride. The final chapter gave me everything most of the other Star Wars movies gave me, ENJOYMENT. If you're a Star Wars fan then go to the theater, sit down, and let it entertain you. My wife went with me, who's not a real Star Wars fan. She's only seen episodes IV, V and VI and she really enjoyed it so there you go.",1
6877,10.0,I'm a life long Star Wars fan!<br /><br />I find good in everything in regards to the franchise.<br /><br />This was horrible!<br /><br />This film made me sad...,0
6878,8.0,"Spoilers alert! I had big expectations, I was super edgy and waiting for twists and awesome sceneries. So in terms of twists I think this movie does a better job of expressing main characters, I felt more connected to not already known characters as Rey, Ren, Poe and Finn, but also new ones like Zorii. I had this feeling that movie had more close ups, focusing on character expressions, more than previous movies. Although I must say I felt a bit estranged with Palpatine. Seen him so much in past, felt like I know him.. but in this movie I've seen him as something new.. not exactly the Palpatine I remember. He is now something more monstrous, but less deep. In my opinion Palpatine felt different kind of sith, far from classic portrayal of him. Same thing was with Chewie, sorry they lost the charm of him.. he was more cold, less emotional and brute. I could not connect to him the same way as I connected in classical trilogy and Force awakens. Sadly.<br /><br />Another aspect I was definitely missing is the story of locations. Every classic and modern Star wars movie has some kind of deeper story of every planet it took place and you get it right away. I have not felt connected to new planets this movie took place, for exception of Pasaana, where I felt the story - quest of seeking the sith dagger, sand, the snake. I liked it. All others - Kijimi - story was plain.. visiting it for a short time just to get bypass on 3PO? No connection.. no deeper story, no adventure ( except for destroyer visit, which is not part of the planet). Jungle planet? What? why? I just remember a few jungle jumps across the river.. and that is it.. Sith planet? No picture whatsoever of planet itself.. Just some dungeon and lightning, it could have happened on any planet same way. I just dont feel the connection, the amusement of those new planets. Its just nice scenery, I do not feel that there is this amazing big world behind the big wafes of sister moon of Endor, Behind rocky mountains of Kijimi, and behind sith throne dungeon. Sadly.<br /><br />Thumbs up for the ending, maybe a bit cliche, but ending on Tatooine - thumbs up, and the yellow lightsabe?!!<br /><br />Expectations fell short, movie rating 6 or 7.",1
6879,2.0,"So, there was Star Wars number 9.<br /><br />Not impressive, not memorable, not terrible either. The series wasn't killed with an awful ending, like Games of Thrones, but it was left to rest on her former glory. Just like Star Wars number 7 and 8, the 9th was a tribute to the past, to the former glory.<br /><br />The censorship and Disney's wise men guidance could be felt in any dialogue and twist of the plot. The lasts were exceptionally tiresome and predictable. I liked the Sith world and their Armada that was supposed to whip out the Resistance fighters. It amused me how the mightiest fleet of the galaxy ended up destroyed by lack of elementary safety features like redundant guiding antennas. The countless script logic flows make it less disturbing.<br /><br />What buttered me most was the lack of good storytelling. Every crew member acted like they were there for a 9 to 5 job, and the director was just a name on the screen. It will never be remembered as J.J. Abrams Star Wars but rather like Disney's SW9. The same can be said about Carrie Fisher and Adam Driver. They are the most meretricious antagonistic couple in the history of the series.<br /><br />But in the end, it's Star Wars, not Dune. I think it's my fault that I aspected more.",0

I'm not going to let other people's opinions take away my experience I had tonight in a theater that roared up in unified cheers more times than I can remember and at several scenes cried together. This fandom is really imature sometimes and just love to feel sorry for themselves. We really don't deserve the fantastic show that has United the fans in the Mandalorian. If it was created by Ryan Johnson but exactly the same, everyone would have bashed it endlessly.

6885,9.0,"Without a doubt, The Rise of Skywalker is an outstanding technical achievement (and artistic, to some extent). Great visual and special effects, impressive locations and sets, lots of well-directed action scenes, mostly decent acting (with Adam Driver shining above all), and of course perfect stunts, lighting, props, make-up and sound design. Last but not least, TROS has an inspiring score, with John Williams heavily stealing from his old work and binding it all together in a beautiful and coherent musical structure that wraps up a saga of 9 epic movies.",1

I don't know what to say apart from, I am THOROUGHLY disappointed. I mean, God gave you Adam Driver and this is what you've done with him? He barely had any screen time! The movie felt like a remake of The Last Jedi (which I loved) but at the same time pretended as if the last two films never happened! Really? I'm gonna pretend THIS movie never happened. If y'all wanna read a proper ending to the Saga I suggest reading 'A collision of Stars' by dustoftheancients on Archive of our Own. Or literally any other fan fic.

No. But it was faithful to the Star Wars vision and theme.

However, this fun only exists in a vacuum where the creative vision of the 2 predecessors are completely voided and the plot is haphazardly assembled around legends, fan lore, and previously ""completed"" canon. The undoing of reys ancestory is almost unforgivable and seemingly lazy, especially when you consider that the films happen in quick succession of one another.

This is not necessarily a bad thing as it can add value when you rewatch the film, however, if you get distracted for only a little bit, you can miss some things. These little things often don't really matter in the bigger picture though.<br /><br />halfway through the movie(till the end) I really started to enjoy the movie. the plot was very interesting, and even surprised me a bit. I like how it diverts from more classic narrative structures which makes watching this movie a more adventure like experience in which you don't really know what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I also like the themes in this movie.

6908,9.0,"The movie was a pleasant surprise to me considering how little expectations I had after TLJ. While it has its flaws, I do think that the movie is good in the context of what it was meant to achieve. I personally think it's best to view it from two points of view, as a standalone movie and as a part of a trilogy<br /><br />1) Standalone Point of view:<br /><br />The movie was way too fast paced. Scenes jumped from one plot to another with very little slow moments. There were too many moments where the characters had to figure out how to get to a location, within 5 seconds they coincidentally get the answer from someone/something nearby. It felt unrealistic and lowered the sense of adventure. But on the positive side the fight scenes were amazing, Rey was both amazing and human, and characters work great when they are together (among the best in the trilogy)<br /><br />2) Viewing in the context of the trilogy<br /><br />When you look at the context of the trilogy, many negatives mentioned above can be explained because JJ had to undo so many plot resolutions that Ryan (movie TLJ) made. From the first scene of the movie, it was clear that the movie attempts to fix many parts of TLJ while also trying to pitch a conclusion to the trilogy. Plot on Rey's parents are redone, a training arc for Rey was included, and a final villain had to be reintroduced because the original final villain (Snoke) was abruptly killed in TLJ. However this meant that both Snoke and the ""final villain"" felt rushed and not properly explored. Also, the unfortunate passing of Carrie Fisher meant that JJ had to create rethink some scenes in the movie using previous unused footage of her too.",1

As for fan service - this is the final chapter in a 9-part story, not a brand new franchise, so shouldn't we expect all the elements to come together at the end?

6920,7.0,"The last time true star wars fans actually liked a star wars movie was in 1983 and that's a problem. Don't stuck in the past the new movies are not about Luke, Leia and Han. You can't expect everything to be the same. I know star wars since I was 7. The prequels wasnt good except the revenge of the sith which was a decent movie. The new trilogy was something different and that's ok. I enjoyed all of the 3 movies and the rise of Skywalker was a good way to end the saga. Wasn't perfect, left us with answers but nonetheless it was good.",1
6921,3.0,"I was hoping this film could somehow redeem the poor efforts of the two predecessors but this one is the worst yet. Almost all logic and rules making up the Star Wars saga are tossed aside to produce great shots, throwing aside logic and storytelling in order to make it simply more of everything. The plot is barely there to tie action scenes and bloated, reused old stuff together.",0
6922,7.0,"In December of 2019, the 9th and last episode of the 3rd star wars trilogy was released. And boy, oh boy, did it suck.",1
6923,1.0,"I think there no end, Other than this one.<br /><br />the death of Ban was so Bad, i think that's is",1
6924,3.0,This is one of the best Star Wars movies ever and really brings the story together in a way that real fans who are true to the franchise can appreciate. Lots of Fake News our there and critics that don't really know or appreciate what this story has been about since it's beginning. What a great display of good vs. evil. The special effects are spectacular. A must see!,1
6925,8.0,"J. J. Abrams takes George Lucas' concepts of the force and absoultely disrespects it. Somehow objects in this movie have the ability to teleport, using the force. Two characters can have a lightsaber duel while they are in different parts of the galaxy, using the force. The only believable thing about the force that J. J. Abrams introduces is the ability to heal others. As far as cinematography goes, the movie has goregeous visuals and backgrounds. The CGI in this movie was actually spot on and looked really good. What really killed this movie was the writing and plot. It is more than obvious that this movie is attempting to cover up the mistakes that the first two movies made. One thing that goes completely unexplained is how the emperor is alive, we get no backstory on how he survived at all. The sith wayfinders were completely pulled out of thin air and thrown into this movie, and they make absolutely no sense when it comes to how they work. The light saber fights in this movie were so bad and slow that they almost belong in the original trilogy. It is also revealed that Rey is related to Palpatine, which Disney pulled right out of in order to 'save' this movie. The movie just lacks a lot of character development, storytelling, and pacing. The entire movie feels so rushed from start to finish, it just does not have a good flow to it at all. Oh, and don't get me started on that kiss and subsequent death at the end. That had me and the rest of the audience wondering ""what the hell was that?"". All in all, if you are a die hard fan of the Star Wars franchise you will be disappointed and pretty upset by the conclusion of this film.",0
6926,10.0,"The critics this movie is receiving are not fair, i believe this is an awesome movie. From my point of view they couldn't have done it better.",1
6927,5.0,"...but as a third movie of a so-called trilogy, one should be allowed to assess it by how well it fits into the whole narrative.",1
6928,10.0,"For the people that say this was the worst star wars film in the franchise?!? Sure there were some scenes that could have been better, but overall this was a very enjoyable film.<br /><br />Star Wars films will never bring home Best Actor awards but who cares.<br /><br />This film is awesome.<br /><br />Bravo!",1
6929,6.0,Wasted 2hrs of my life. Found out there was no plan when making this movie so you just watching a bad version of the original trilogy.,0
6930,9.0,"(Skip the first part if you wanna get straight to the review, this is just background information about me so you can understand my rational behind the score and review I'm giving you)",1
6931,1.0,"This was not a great movie but it was in my opinion the best they could do within a runtime with all that they were tasked with doing. This was not a sequel to a movie or the 3rd in a trilogy that needed to be wrapped up. This was the end of the 3rd chapter of a saga that has been loved by millions for 40+ years. Negative reviews are likely to be from long time fans who wanted to see the story follow a certain path. George Lucas was the underdog who stuck it to the studios by making the story he wanted and relying on visuals that didn't meat his own cause of limitations forcing him to be innovative and that's why the original trilogy was and is so beloved. The prequal trilogy was a continuation of Lucas' vision without any limitations and he was no longer the underdog, he was king of the mountain and was criticized brutally for it. The sequel trilogy is no longer Lucas. The things that made the original so great, the limitations and innovations no longer exist. The story is subjective. The canon has been re-written. The expectations are that Lucas' vision will complete the saga. That is not the case. Disney took a different approach and the fans showed their disgust. They needed a consistent story split into 3 movies but that's not what they got or asked for. These are the reasons this is not a great movie.",1
6932,6.0,Not perfect but it's still Star Wars and it was entertaining. It even had Ewoks...what more could you ask for.,1
6933,8.0,"Maybe is the first time I see a 200 million dollar apology. Tons of fan service to make it up to all the people that hated episode VIII to the point that important elements of the story happen just because, just to please you. They pull plot twists like rabbits out of the hat and want you to go along with it.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it. It's far from perfect but I'd like to think that this movie is better than The Last Jedi (sure, the bar was set very low), that it is very watchable, that JJ's pacing is cool and dynamic, that the movie is more respectful with chacaters (old and new) and doesn't have futile subplots.<br /><br />Still seems like they didn't know how to develop Finn and Poe, but I left the theater with a good sensation I don't recall having 2 years ago.",1
6934,9.0,"The plot is not perfect, but I think it has a lot of star wars in it and the music with the visuality is stunning.",1
6935,7.0,"I'm not a big fan but watched all 9, decades ago it might good but now it's just out of date",0
6936,9.0,"This movie is definitely worth watching. It fixes all the sacrilegious mistakes and insults of the last jedi, as much as possible.<br /><br />Not only this, but it has great music, great choreography, great lightsaber battles, superb cinematics and a few surprises as well.",1
6937,4.0,"This film is an alright film. There are some predictable bits, but then there is also some plot twists. At points it's easy to see that they were trying too hard to be funny. 8/10.",1
6938,9.0,"The bitter reviews are from old fans who base their opinions on nostalgia from the original. This Star wars finally brings together the full potential of jedis, not simply lifting rocks like the boring original trilogy did. This is bu far the best. You get everything you want from it. If you watched Clone wars and rebels. If you've played KOTOR or Fallen order. You finally get a star wars that brings forward the true potential of jedis. And for those who dont like it, not real fans",0
6939,7.0,"I went into this movie with moderate expectations. I liked Episodes VII and VIII, and I was worried this one would undo the best ideas from the previous film. In a way, it did, but insofar as these three movies mirrored the original trilogy, and the way the story of Rey's family drives the story, The Rise of Skywalker succeeded in creating a coherent story with meaningful relationships at its core. The movie had a lot goals, tying in characters from the original trilogy while giving the new cast some great adventures both together and apart. Yes, one could call some of the choices ""fan service,"" and one could argue the movie could have taken more risks, and one could point out that a number of the plot points were predictable. I totally see that perspective. But for me, it worked. I love the old cast, and I think the characters were handled with respect and reverence. And I love the new cast, and I was so happy to see the love and friendship and humor between them. As a conclusion to the new trilogy, and to the most significant movie franchise in history, I am so pleased to say that this came out so well. If this is a polarizing movie, I'm happy to be on the side that enjoyed it.",1
6940,10.0,Clearly the makers of the film were high and never bothered reanalyzing the plot. Highly predictable moments & some crap that isn't explained or makes no sense.... Still fun in a way,1
6941,9.0,"Very good movie, this is the first sci-fi movie that I watched since I was 10 years old. It always leaves a huge impression of a vast universe with many races fighting against each other.",1

6943,10.0,"This movie has a lot in it but in the end this movie was action packed fun and very entertaining it's ashamed that this movie has so much hate behind it star wars films have always been just okay movies so I don't know why this one would be any different, still what I can say is this was the most entertaining one their is so...",1
6944,7.0,It's a great movie! The story arc for Kylo Ren and Rey is beautifully done!👍,1
6945,8.0,"Let's be clear, none of the new trilogy were ever going to succeed, because of the horrendous toxicity which is the Star Wars fan base.",0
6946,9.0,"If you are a fan and not one of those nit-picky nerds, you will love this film.<br /><br />A great conclusion doing it's best to wrap up all loose ends in a single film, while also making a few OT and Prequel references for the fans.<br /><br />Anyone looking at this from a film standpoint might not like it. This is a film aimed at the fans.<br /><br />If you love Star Wars, go see it yourself!",1
6947,9.0,"As a Star Wars lover who has some knowledge of Star Wars and the force this movie was a massive let down. But there definitely were a few things that my geek self absolutely loved to see...and then of course followed an immediately let down. One huge up from me though is the cinematography, it's stunning.",1
6948,8.0,Admittedly the beginning is a chaotic WTF cluster...but it soon settles in to a much worthy amazing farewell to an old friend that will forever remain part of the fabric of our existence.<br /><br />But don't take my word for it. Just ask my 7 year old grandpup who couldn't take his eyes off of it the entire 2 hours plus.,1
6949,6.0,"I grew up with the original trilogy. I saw The Phantom Menace on opening night and loved it! I was surprised by the terribly negative reviews that followed. The next two movies didn't fare much better. Now reviewers are bashing the latest trilogy and putting episodes 1-3 on a pedestal... what a joke. Do they think we've forgotten? We're supposed to forget the latest trilogy because it wasn't exactly what they envisioned? We're told that this trilogy isn't cohesive? I disagree. Yes, some minor storylines were not further developed in the final movie but the major themes are there and they carry thru all three movies.",1
6950,9.0,"As a huge fan of the franchise for the last 15 years, this is such a spectacular way to finish of the franchise. Obviously no spoilers but if you haven't seen it yet, you need too!!<br /><br />May the force be with you always...",1
6951,9.0,What's wrong with all of you?? I watched this film with my siblings and we all loved it.,0
6952,10.0,I really love the Star Wars trilogy and I thought this was an amazing end to the story of skywalker. I loved the action but wished there was a stronger emotional tie to all of the characters. Other than that I thought it was a phenomenal film and people who love Star Wars should go. I also loved the contrast in the Kylo ren and Rey fight compared to anakin and obi-wan. The water was similar to the lava and the love that the two pairs shared was very similar.,1
6953,9.0,"I am that kid who saw Star Wars 33 times in the theatre back in 1977. I know the lines by heart, I still get excited when I see the blockade runner racing across the stars with the star destroy close behind. I am and will always be a fan. The new movie is entertaining, and does have some really cool effects. I thought it tied up some of the loose ends that needed to be covered, and gave me an ending i thought was pretty cool. There are some issues that have plagued the last view films, bad dialogue, to much stuff going on, not great acting. I do believe overall the movie had enough positives to say go see it.",1
6954,9.0,"Let me start with the positives.<br /><br />The actors did well for the nonsense they were handed. Although a lot of plotlines and exposition didn't make sense, they at least delivered the lines with confidence and emotion.<br /><br />The special effects are stunning. When you're not laughing at how utterly ridiculous what's going on is, the visual fidelity is great.<br /><br />And that's about it for positives.",0
6955,6.0,"The pace of the movie is fast ... Better than TLJ, the visuals are spectacular to see . When it comes to twists they will leave you in disbelief and I also wonder why it was necessary to copy a dialogue stlye in climax from the MCU ( like ""And I'm all the Jedi "" )<br /><br />The acting permofances of Adam driver was delightful to watch , Daisy Ridley was better from the TLJ. Carrie Fisher was amazing<br /><br />BGM, scores are top notch , and the war scene/ climax was little bit predicted and you can guess easily what's gonna come .<br /><br />Am I the only one who thinks the Ben and Ray's make out was quite unnecessary ? Like their chemistry was nothing like anakin and padme !!",1
6956,3.0,Haters gonna hate. Great ending to the new trilogy!!!,1
6957,7.0,"I read the mostly negative reviews and went into the theatre expecting to be disappointed. Much to my surprise, I was very entertained and thrilled with the film! I'm a long time fan, and was very skeptical after the last film, but The Rise of Skywalker closed the trilogy amazingly well and I em left the theatre satisfied.",1
6958,10.0,"Best of the new trilogy (and prequel trilogy). Lot of fun, lot of nostalgia. Three generations of our family loved it.",1
6959,9.0,They really brought it together with this finale. I really enjoyed the growth of the characters force powers that actually inflict an aww factor.,1
6960,10.0,I think it is that people expect to much from the new Star Wars films so everyone is disappointed at the when they see the films.<br /><br />I didn't love the new film and I didn't hate it.<br /><br />I thought the film was all most identical to Star Wars 6 Return of the Jedi. For example both films are about a character thinking whether or not to turn to the dark side.<br /><br />It would have been better if all three films on this trilogy were directed by the same person.<br /><br />In conclusion it did enough to end the trilogy but not enough to be a classic Star Wars film.,0
6961,10.0,"I have been a fan of the series since I was 5 years old and episode four released! I LOVE Star Wars and I loved the job JJ Abrams did to wrap up this story. Could I pick out several issues? Yeah probably, but overall I walked out of theatre feeling satisfied with how it concluded.",1
6962,6.0,"Why the hate. Such a good movie. Seriously, have fun and enjoy it and don't overthink it",1
6963,9.0,I will start by saying this movie should of been two movies or should have introduced certain elements in previous movies. I won't elaborate too much on that because I don't want too give too much away.,0
6964,10.0,"Fall short of words. When I watch this movie, I said ; that's it ,this is Star Wars.",0
6965,10.0,The worst thing that is happening to the modern movie industry is leaks. People now go in to movies with other people's words ringing in their ears and can't form their own opinion. Oh and then there is a certain hatred of Disney thrown in to the mix.,0
6966,10.0,"I went to see this movie thinking i would watch an epic fail do to the bad reviews i read. DONT MIND THE CRITICS! I had a blast! If you are a casual SW fan and like an action pact movie with a sprinkle of nostalgia, this movie is for you. This is an this epic conclusion to one of the most celebrated movie franchises in the history of film.",0
6967,8.0,The Force Awakens was a film that I think most people could agree wasn't terrible but too much of a remake of New Hope to be considered great. I actually enjoyed it and thought JJ did a good job of setting up a new trilogy with it's own questions. Who is Snoke? Who's Rey's parents? Why did Luke's lightsaber call out to Rey in the basement of the cantina? What will Luke do if he he's found? Etc.,1
6968,10.0,This is the best conclusion that this film series deserved.,1
6969,10.0,"So I decided not to read any reviews before going to watch this for a number of reasons, the main one is that whilst I may have rose tinted glasses having been a fan of Star Wars since I watched the original saga aged 5 a long time ago, I can't stand people pouring mud over what is an incredibly enjoyable franchise on so many levels.<br /><br />This film was fantastic, it's got everything to it and I would encourage any real fan out there to go and watch it and enjoy the whole saga being drawn to an end in the most action packed, thrilling and dramatic fashion.<br /><br />It features generations old and new and pays such attention to the finer details of how that story comes about that it left me with goosebumps, I will watch it again and again because I'm a fan and a follower and found this a real treat.",1
6970,10.0,Title says it all very impressed with everything bringing back so many memories from all the Star Wars 10 out of 10,1
6971,10.0,"Don't listen to the angry ""everything is written by corporate social elitists"" knuckle draggers trolling anything g they think has any semblance of a political agenda. Just go see it, it's a decent movie, tying the originals, the prequels, and current Trilogy together. What more do you need really.",1
6972,10.0,"From start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Action and set pieces were excellent and the visuals were nothing short of phenomenal. Great new characters, charm, emotion, comedy and lots of fan service! JJ did a great job with this film. Bravo Bad Robot.",1
6973,7.0,Look I'm gonna get hate here but I'm a Star Wars kid. Period. My entire life there has been Star Wars. I was literally born 2 months after ANH came out. I've loved the franchise my entire life. As a matter of fact the older I get the more I love it. Nothing is perfect. The movie wasn't perfect but I still love it and always will.,1
6974,8.0,"Just love the way the saga end. Anyway, I am still unhappy with Ben Solo. He deserves better than that.",1
6975,8.0,"I was thoroughly intrigued and entertained from start to finish. I felt the lead and supporting cast turned in great performances. A very pleasing and exciting end to this trilogy. The Force Awakens warranted a two-movie continuation to delve into, develop, and bring closure to the world and character arches that were created for this trilogy, and the abysmal Last Jedi simply did not deliver, so I was impressed with how J.J. Abrams picked up the story and finished the trilogy in a really strong and satisfying way. I'm a sucker for film scores as well, and John Williams did not disappoint. The music and sound design expertly complemented and heightened the dynamic emotion in certain scenes and the physicality of others.",1
6976,10.0,"The movie had a lot of excitement and Star Wars worthy adventure. Overall creating a satisfying end to the trilogy and saga. However, rather than building on the first few movies, some of the major plot reveals and story theme lines seemed a but unexpected or hurriedly put together in the first few minutes of the show. Still a great movie and worth your time to see!",1
6977,9.0,"Don't listen to the 1/10 reviews who are convinced it has been completely Disneyfied. It is a perfect ending to the Skywalker saga that is beautifully crafted by JJ Abrams. It has many moments of nostalgia whilst having a fresh and new storyline. It is very fast paced with amazing lightsaber battles, it's very humorous at points and extremely emotional throughout.",1
6978,9.0,Probably one of the better Star Wars movies because it had a very satisfying ending for a rather lackluster Trilogy one of my biggest problems with this movie was that the pacing was slow at times but nothing to drastic another con of this movie was the amount of original members of Star Wars and how much the movie relies on these characters moving on to pros this movie tries to erase most things that happened in The Last Jedi and how much of a blunder that movie was Finally at the end of this movie I wanted more of Rey Poe and Finn no spoilers but there are no mid and end post credit scenes so don't sit in your seat any much longer you have to,0
6979,6.0,"I was very pleased with this film despite having low expectations after Disney picked it up. It did a great job filling in the gaps and adding new depth to the Star Wars universe. Sure, it was a little hokey in parts just like the rest of the films but I found the ending to be amazing and well thought out.",1
6980,9.0,"Truthfully, it is worth to watch, the only disappointment i have, is that, it feels to short. Here is why:<br /><br />-In my opinion it was a good idea to bring back Palpatine, although he seems so small in terms of his presence. His machinations are somewhat obscure, the exact reason of him being resurrected is not quite clear.<br /><br />-I guess there were some hints of Kylo Ren being a good guy in the end, but the character seems to be more or less useless. Not a ""good bad guy"" and not a ""good good guy"" .<br /><br />-The supporting characters have no impact on the primary characters with exception of Lando and Leia, which seem to do their jobs as mentors and although short presence in the movie for Lando at least (Because Leia was archived footage).<br /><br />-Rey seems an OK character, but the time spent developing herself within the movie from ""might be the hero we are looking for"" to "" is the hero we are looking for"" is just so short.<br /><br />For the story now:<br /><br />-Lack of a clear negative character.<br /><br />-I do not understand what a "" force dyad"" is and what it implies.",0
6981,8.0,"I don't understand what the people that they low rated the movie were thinking?<br /><br />It is a great movie, enjoyed every second of it.",1
6982,6.0,"Never go full. But this movie did and it was hilarious. Everything was stupid because everything has been done before, so... Cavalry on a spaceship? Sounds like an excellent plan.",1
6983,10.0,"And it is sad to tell that I am telling that for a Star Wars movie.<br /><br />As a hardcore Star Wars fan, growing up with the movies, games, comics and animated series, I was highly disappointed by the 8th movie and so, I entered the cinema for the 9th one, with rather low expectations. The movie was ok!<br /><br />I did not feel that I have wasted my money, but I did not feel like they did the best they could. And there are two reasons why. (keeping it spoiler free, do not be afraid to read)<br /><br />1. The story line was meh. Not enough to say about that. Star Wars lives from the originality of the story and the character development. If you miss those two points, the whole thing is just some CGI effects and lightsabers.<br /><br />2. Fan Serivce. I mean, I love it when I get to see thing I like. But this movie tried to give the fans all they wanted, forgetting the fact that the movie has to be an original one.",0
6984,5.0,"Someone needs to go back in time, burn all the star wars VHS thingamabobs or movies or whatever u wanna call them so we wouldn't have to watch this disaster. We did not wait 30000 years for this finale. Just saying the last scene was a copy of romeo and juliet",0
6985,6.0,"Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a 20 year old Jedi, she's the main character in the last and final movie in the Star Wars Movies, she's going on an amazing adventure with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) to find the planet Exegol, the secret world of the sith, and right against them, there's Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiaemid).",1

I'm an adult man who can be classified as serious and a bit grumpy, but throw star wars in the mix and I'm a 10 year old child.<br /><br />Disney was going to do their thing and star wars fans knew it.<br /><br />I'm taking my friend's son to see the film today, he said he is a bit of a star wars buff. His fave is the phantom menace. Oh dear. He will be crying when I explain empire.<br /><br />I'm going to enjoy this film and I have a new hope that the saga is concluded and as a nearly 50 year old we can go again.<br /><br />F##k reviews and enjoy the movie",1
6988,10.0,"I went into the movie and kept the most open mind I could and in the end: I loved it! Yes, it was jumbled and cramped, but it was all The Last Jedi's fault. In my opinion, J.J. Abrams did a great job summing up HIS story and did a great job course-correcting after TLJ. Was is perfect? Absolutely not. There were things that didn't make sense but I feel they would have if they just had J.J. do the whole trilogy. There were a few moments that made me groan and roll my eyes, but all in all, I took the movie and saw it as an abridged version of what the whole trilogy was supposed to be. If they could split Rise of Skywalker into three movies it would have been a trilogy I would have immensely loved seeing. (I was not a huge fan of Force Awakens and I hated The Last Jedi) Seriously, this one movie should have been the entire story of the new trilogy. All they needed to do was give Rey an origin and then just jump straight into this movie's story and I would have been happy with what Disney did. In my mind, TLJ never happened and the story is just The Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker, and I am truly happy with how it turned out. 8/10",1
6989,10.0,"Look I am of a certain age that I remember when movies were fantastic. they had to be different, appealing to the senses, above and beyond normalcy and generally make us feel we are getting treated.<br /><br />It seems all of that has disappeared from movies nowadays. The stories make no sense and no explanation is bothered with. The women are as plain or ugly as any women (indeed in many cases like the new Star Wars trilogy they are uglier than women I would see walking by anywhere). The sole exception recently was Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, which not coincidentally depicted a time long gone. The explicit or implicit messaging is non-existent and shunned in favor of just having a franchise and so on and on it goes.<br /><br />The Rise Of Skywalker is just such a movie. I am a man. I have limited time and money. If movies do not want to cater to my brain or my heart or my loin then why bother?<br /><br />I can simply stay at home and feel the breeze in my balcony (and maybe a pretty girl in a short skirt will also walk by and that would cost me nothing).",0
6990,8.0,I got an IMDb account just to be able to rate this movie. It was clearly made with a deep love for the Star Wars universe and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it! I truly do not understand the sour reviews and low ratings I've been seeing.,1
6991,,"First to say, seven out of ten is maybe more than the movie should get from me, but still I can't hate it, just because the writing is awful! The visuals, the sound editing and the characters are good or even great (I'm not talking about the character development), some moments are wonderfully made and others have a great atmosphere to it (like the Sith audience in the final battle). But... no it's more like BUT!!! The complete script is an insult to logic and scriptwriting itself.",0
6992,10.0,"Before seeing this film I heard it wasn't getting the best reviews. Youtubers I watched we're hating all over it and I was worried it was going to be another bad Star Wars film like The Last Jedi (which I enjoy more now than I did when I first saw it in the cinema, but it's still in my bottom 3 favourite Star Wars films) and so I decided to go into this film not expecting a lot.",1
6993,7.0,"This is a story about parents and children - and adopting a family. Just as Episodes IV through VI dealt with Luke redeeming his father, this movie also deals with redemption. It also deals with another universal theme about how those who are evil isolate their victims and convince others that their impulses to help are foolish, vain, and solitary. The truth in life - we hope - and in this film is the opposite. Just as the townspeople save George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""people"" come to the rescue of our heroes. They called Capra's movies ""Capracorn"" but they become classic beloved films. So too will this Star Wars film.",1
6994,8.0,"Some story elements feel a bit like a stretch, but overall, the movie does a good job at bringing most of the (broken) ends together that TLJ had left open or even created itself. Yes, it is a lot of fan service, but that does not make the movie any worse than it could have been.",1

6996,9.0,Which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.,0
6997,3.0,"I grew up with Star Wars. And it was all about great story telling!! This movie is pure garbage. I can't believe after forty years of the stars wars universe they can't keep things exactly the same as the first movies. Who can believe this dribble? It's just a spectacle of amazing special effects and fun characters... what a boring event!! The light saber battles were too realistic, the millennium falcon has been beat to crap but is a survivor, the x wings looked a little too cool, The effects were just too good looking for a real Star Wars movie!!

6998,8.0,"I don't trust critic opinions after watching this movie. The Rise of Skywalker was an amazing ending to an unsteady trilogy. It fixed almost every blunder that The Last Jedi brought to the series. It's also worth noting that, while it is still Disney, this movie was a lot darker in tone than I had anticipated which made it ""a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.""",1
6999,,From the getgo im a STARWARS fan im 44 ive literally grown up on this franchise and i seriously dont understand the hate this is getting!<br /><br />Ive never done a review before as you can probably tell but felt the need to do so on this one<br /><br />I loved the ORIGINAL trilogy no shock there<br /><br />I loved force awakens even if it had similarities to a new hope it had the feel of a STARWARS film to me and i embraced it i didnt like last jedi i wasent happy with how a jedi hero of mine was portrayed by throwing his jedi weapon like a carry on film and milking a animal ....not for me but that aswell as this review is just my opinion now onto rise of Skywalker i absolutely loved this film epic action from the getgo and from halfway through i was very emotional i was still emotional hours later i tought jj did a amazing job and kept it like the old STARWARS movies i dont want to leave spoilers so all i will say is go see this movie for yourself and make up your own mind but this is from a starwars fan and i loved this movie<br /><br />just go in open minded as i did and hopefully you will have the same experience i did ....<br /><br />....( HEY KID ) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,1
7000,9.0,"To me this film had it all. It's nice to see old cast back again, old spaceship's etc.<br /><br />I am more than happy with this as an end to the movie and I look forward to when I can watch it again at home.",1

7004,10.0,"I personally enjoyed the movie. I feel like Star Wars movies will always be graded on a harsher curve than most because of its history. I gave this movie an 8 because despite how much I liked it, there were a few moments that I felt came out of nowhere. The moments that made up for it made me react with a lot of joy, which were far more. I feel like the movie had an uphill battle trying to continue off of TLJ. Is this movie perfect? No. Is it better than it's current grade? Absolutely.",1
7005,6.0,"Went with my wife, who is not a Star Wars fan, I am. And we both enjoyed the movie very much. There was a group of young 20-25 years old sitting next to me in the theater, and they frequently critized actions during the movie. But I just realized they used the movie for social currency, to be able to say something negativ and try to look smart and cool and to contribute to their group dynamics on the movie, this looked so obvious and was eye opening. And I just think that's mostly the reason of all those 1/10s here, it's to be able to say something which contributes to a discussion and spend time with doing it. But I strongly believe that the three guys next to me enjoyed the movie a lot :-).",1
7006,8.0,"1/3 of the way in, I caught myself several times contemplating on where this Episode stood on my list, as I was most certain it would be top 3 (behind, III & V). However, the drama never let up, the stakes remained high, and the action felt like a nuke had dropped on the entire theater. As to why critics, whether or not they're paid to post, regard this film as lackluster or simple fan-service, I don't understand. I chose to not watch a single teaser or trailer for the movie and by doing so, I was blown away and will always cherish this installment. I felt the humor was far more natural and less forced, contrary to VIII, the action surpassed any preconceived notions, and the ending was absolutely perfect. On my drive home, I debated where exactly this episode stood, and as I finally surrendered my outright love for Revenge of the Sith, I had no choice but to place The Rise of Skywalker on top. I was honestly skeptical how the finale would salvage what The Last Jedi had damaged, as far as the essence of Star Wars storyarch is concerned, but thankfully, I too can fade away, leaving behind nothing but the garbs of a man out of touch with style.",1

7008,10.0,"I thought it was refreshing to see someone not as bad/good as people think they are. Well, I would gladly see Rey become the Sith tho, but since the Skywalker saga is about to end with this sequel, I think it's a good closure. And Kylo Ren did what I expected him to be and the plot really gave him the justice. Even if he didn't make it in tthe end but I think it's necessary to end the saga. Also all the casts get some important roles unloke the previous sequel. What's not to like? I don't get the hate people give to this movie. I think it's beautiful and I would like to rewatch this again in theatre. Please, don't bash a good movie like this.",1

7010,8.0,"I fully expected this to be the worst among its two predecessors, but, going in with an open mind, I'm okay with it. It fared muchhhhh better than Last Jedi, and I'd say is equal to Force Awakens. I understood that some of the story would be messy, from having to transfer from one director to another, but for the most part, it worked. I genuinely laughed maybe two or three times, actually felt some sadness during one or two scenes, and yeah, given what it was built on, I really thought it came out better than I/most were expecting.",0
7011,1.0,Life long 43 year old fan that was brought to tears several times! Absolutely loved it and especially the first 10-15 minutes!

7012,7.0,"As a die hard fan I don't understand the negativity behind this movie. JJ was given an arduous task after his predecessors misgivings. He created a magical movie, made the best choices he could with the characters that made sense and finished the movie on a high. This was Star Wars no doubt about it and I wouldn't have had it any other way.",0

7014,10.0,"This is actually a pretty good, passable Star Wars movie. Better than the prequel series and just about on par with the best of the sequel trilogy. The story and dialogue were compelling, and It didn't feel like I was being preached to, like with the Last Jedi (TLJ). However, with all the good things about this film, there are two glaring problems. The first was with its treatment of Carrie fisher's Leia. Instead of giving her a dignified exit, either during TLJ or sometime between films, the writers of the story decided to shoehorn in unused unseen footage. And let me tell you: it. Shows. In every scene she is in, everything else is sharp, and she has a hazy glow around her. Every bit of dialogue that came out of her mouth was so dang out of place.<br /><br />Therein lies my biggest gripe of the movie: the editing. Aside from the shoddy job inserting Leia into her scenes, Every shot ends about three seconds before it should. The beauty of Star Wars lies in the creation of a world that feels lived in, with imperfections and flaws inherent to a society. Even if, in essence, that is there, it is impossible to find that, to appreciate that when the screen cuts every two seconds. This was the first Star Wars movie, perhaps the first MOVIE where it was actually nauseating to watch.<br /><br />These unforgivable elements distract from an otherwise solid Star Wars flick.",1
7015,10.0,"Full of plot holes and filled with unnecessary nostalgia and didn't seem to care about the characters arcs or motivations I hated what they did to Rey, regressing and infantiliazed her, with not arc on her own, and Ben deserved so much more screen time, they had an amazing actor and wasted him, the only good thing was the chemistry between Rey and Ben, but it most of the writing choices didn't made sense. And what they did to Rose Tico only to please the people who bullied Kelly and harrased her out social media, it didn't feel like a fitting ending. It made the whole sequel trilogy unnecessary and that's sad because the characters were cool... if only they had better writer.",0
7016,7.0,"This movie started off campy, hokey, too fan service focused. A lot like the rest of the series. It was definitely a little too short, missing some of that character building between Finn and Rey etc. It was deeply ridiculous, to the point I rolled my eyes. But that extreme lows of this movie was matched by extreme highs. The cinematography and music were next level even for ST, the scenery and puppetry was as well. The story arc tho, inspired, the chemistry of Rey and Ben was palpable. The cheese of star wars as a whole was blasted full tilt but so was its romantic heroism. It was a lot. And it was fun, sad, hilarious, stupid and very very memorable. I'll watch this again and again.",1
7017,1.0,"Visuals, sound, effects and action are on par if not better than End Game. The story did feel slightly rushed and had some pacing issues midway but I can't imagine the task of coming up with a more satisfying conclusion to something like this.<br /><br />All the little sooks out there giving a 1 star need to seriously consider what 1 star actually means. There are many poor quality movies with bad dialogue and pathetic stories that probably deserve a 2 or 3 star.<br /><br />To me it is disrespectful to all the effort put into this, that does show.",0
7018,10.0,I have no idea what anyone is complaining about. This movie made me feel satisfied! This is an excellent movie. Some people just expect too much or never satisfied with what they are given.,1
7019,7.0,"This is coming from someone who was disappointed by the Last Jedi. I actually liked this movie. The consensus is that this movie is terrible. It's not terrible. It's a decent movie with issues. I have two primary issues with this movie. The first is that it is very rushed. The reason for why it is rushed being us to my second primary issue, which is coherency. The Last Jedi didn't truly continue the story begun by Force Awakens and it didn't really develop the characters. As a result of this, we were left with a movie that was essentially a throw away movie. It didn't progress anything. Because of that, arch wise, there is no middle movie. Consequently, the third movie has to hurriedly develop characters and thrust you into the finale, making this movie very rushed. The trilogy lacks coherency because of this lack of a middle movie. It may as well not exist. If they ever wanted to make another second movie to the trilogy that gave a coherency to the trilogy, I wouldn't hesitate at all to watch that movie. So much of what is wrong with this last movie in the trilogy could be mended because this third movie is made in way that would suggest we had a movie before this that was not The Last Jedi. If a movie we're made to essentially replace the Last Jedi this would be a much better trilogy, for we need a movie that continues the story of Force Awakens and develops characters and gives a smooth transition into the third movie that provides context and setup for things that occur in the third movie. Go and see this movie. It has great action and all the characters are fun and likable. While many people did not like Palpitine in this, I personally thought this made the film much more interesting by having Palpatine than it would have been without him. Don't let anyone tell you can't like this movie. It's your choice to like it or not. Whichever you choose I respect it. All I ask is that you give it a chance, which is unfortunately more that what so many people who saw this movie gave it. There are a lot of people out there who are trying to bully everyone else to hate the movie and it's sad. Star Wars fans, I know for many of you this trilogy has been disappointing, but I ask that you let others enjoy it, for there are people out there who do like it and there is nothing wrong with that.",0
7020,10.0,It was bad. There was barely a story. No depth to any character. Random love interests flung in. The first half was just non-stop nothingness with comic relief thrown in every 10 mins. They way they shoehorned Carrie into horrific dialogue was horrible. Star Wars usually has slow moments. There was none in this.,0
7021,7.0,To replace the 8th film (my least favourite) this film has done really well with kylo ren being as powerful as he should be and reys parents being explained what we were supposed to find out in the 8th film the 9th film is definitely the best,1
7022,3.0,"The movie is hard to keep ut with because it's very strange. New characters and new things that you've never found out happenings in the movie. It's the only Star Wars movie that isn't ""realistic"" and it feels like the script was written separately from the other Star Wars movies. The movie's plot is quite boring but the movie serves it's purpose to end the Skywalker saga. The movie is still well made but it's quite uninteresting and the movie changes the whole Skywalker saga because Rey is the new chosen one to bring ballans in the force (so then Anakin Skywalker isn't the chosen one?) The final battle between Rey and Palpatine is kinda silly. The idé with that Palpatine is back is good but the execution is bad. The best thing with the movie is still the final battle between Rey and Palpatine. It's a perfectly okey Star Wars movie because it served it's purpose and you can still watch it.",1

The film is a mess as a film but it did, for me, evoke emotion.

Imperial March is amazing, but 40 years old.<br /><br />How come there is not a single tune that I remember form any of the last 3 episodes?

7031,10.0,Disney's handing of Star Wars has been a disaster that risks destroying the franchise altogether. Now JJ's bookend failure is complete.

7034,6.0,"I see all the negative and I get that people are entitled to their opinions. Of course. However I think people truly forget what this is about. What it means. Families, being lost in another galaxy, having so many other people drawn together for a common thing. Star Wars. It's more then people hating. So I went in knowing it's not going to be perfect, but another opportunity for my kids and I to enjoy something together. Between the Clone Wars and Rebels, the movies and now the Mandolorian, we get together and if you don't see the reasons for that, then being angry it wasn't perfect is your own deal. We shed tears and cheers. That's what Star Wars does.",1
7035,3.0,"Star Wars grew from one movie with sequels and prequels and even more sequels. The entire saga was about... bringing balance to the Force. The story has never been absolute perfect but forgivable because it's s story like no other than has character depth and a plot from start to finish that fans can understand. Evil arises in the Phantom Menace. That evil is countered and eventually defeated in Rise of Skywalker. As a fan who watched the very first movie many years ago as child, I can say I feel satisfied with its conclusion. No, this movie was not the best of the bunch but tied up loose ends with suspense and surprises. We see good triumph over evil one again and the Skywalker family playing a significant role as expected.",1

7041,9.0,"1. I like how they develop Rey and Ben's force connection.. and make Reylo for real :)<br /><br />But I really think Ben doesnt need to die.. Rey and Ben can just go to some planet, live their own lives together. as they should be. as a dyad in a force. I thought 'dyad in force' will make 2 options: live together or die together.<br /><br />Although there might be a concern if Ben's alive... Skywalker bloodline will be continue.. and there's possibility their heir will take dark path (again). The curse of Skywalker bloodline happens again. hahah",1
7042,10.0,Under the circumstances I think JJ Abrams did the best he could with what Rian Johnson left him to work with. No this trilogy is not amazing. The story had great potential which was all but ruined by Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy in The Last Jedi. Despite having many important characters destroyed in the previous installment I feel like Abrams still managed to turn this into a decent story. I left the theater after watching The Last Jedi with a sickened feeling in my stomach. After watching The Rise of Skywalker I actually had a sense of satisfaction and closure.<br /><br />P.S. Thank you JJ Abrams for putting Rose Tico on time-out in this one!!!,1

7045,1.0,"Attempts to appease some of the mistakes of the other new films. Over all, alot of cliches and far too faster pace and misses out on key moments. Even as a generic action film it feels bad.

Let's capitalize on LOTR and show a main character a few times"", but then they would cut away like ""maybe this is a bad idea""<br /><br />And finally, there were sections where I said ""oh, yes this is a Disney movie"" because it had that unmistakable feel to it.<br /><br />It is a good movie, and I will watch it again, but..... *sigh*",0
7050,10.0,"I actually enjoyed TFA, I even thought TLJ was ok. I left the cinema thinking that wasn't too bad. I went into this one with an open mind ready for it to take me into the world of star wars.

It did settle down in the after the first hour or so, but by then it had lost me.<br /><br />Some scenes were so unbelievable too, I laughed out loud when it was totally inappropriate like when Ray blew up the ship and screamed CHHEEHEWWWYYY! also when Ray kissed Kylo. I chuckled slightly at some of the jokes that helped pass the time. I watched as the same scenarios from the previous films were played out in front of me. I had seen this all before and I was bored, Bored. I'm so gutted , I'm actually still sad from the experience and I watched it 3 days ago. 4/10 stars only because the special effects were very good and I always appreciate John Williams score.",0

7054,10.0,"Put simply, there is absolutely no way that this film deserves a 1/10 rating at any stretch. Even as a standalone film without any ties to any other film (not even the recent trilogy), it should earn a higher rating than that. It is a GOOD film and, moreover, I think it was excellently handled by Abrams and Disney (and no, I'm not being paid to write this, unfortunately). The reality is that almost any ending would make some hardcore fans outraged. But I think we still benefit hugely from the existence of this trilogy, including this imperfect, but very solid ending.",1
7055,8.0,"I rarely type reviews. But I felt I needed to in the case of rise of Skywalker. First I hated this movie from beginning to end. forced gender politics, and the need to pander to a small group of people in world is a sad day in cinema. I hoped after force awakens it was gonna be something interesting and fresh. But nope last Jedi proved to be a complete and utter piece of trash. Kylo ren was the only character I was interested in, and he has been reduced to a whiny, weak and frail spoiled teenager. Rey is a Mary Sue that never does wrong and can a does ever lose or be defeated in anyway. How can I get behind her? No flaws, no development, and no emotion on any scale. I hate her. Also Finn has been just cast aside for more Rey nonsense. Please stay away from this trilogy.",0

7058,2.0,"There's nothing immensely wrong with this movie for it to receive such a lot of crappy (pardon my language) reviews! It's really bewildering. The more I think of it the more this insane phenomenon of ""trash reviewing"" comes across to me as some sort of psychiatric dementia out of the pages of one of Freud's books. This can truly only be a bizarre side effect of the too much social network use our world has been immersed in! Clearly this isn't Oscar material. But coming to think of it, I can't recall of a single Star Wars movie to which a best movie Oscar, best actor or at least best screenplay was awarded. This is evidently a big budget movie which was designed with the primordial intent (apart from the market issue) of providing entertainment. And that it certainly does! This movie is extremely beautiful looking, thrilling and definitely better than most of this super hero formula thing we tend to get every month. However the so called fans will claim anything in order to bury any merit that could be derived from this production. It's like they're on some holy crusade against big corporations such as Disney, failing to realize that the reason Star Wars was sold to a big player like Disney in the first place was because George Lucas felt terribly disheartened about producing further movies after his prequel trilogy got so much pummeling from this same saint crusaders fan movement. These people will say anything in order to make the flick look like a poorly contrived piece of ""fan fiction"" mustered up be a four year old boy, such as affirming:<br /><br />I- The trilogy clearly wasn't planned from the ""get go"". Apparently not indeed and it could possibly have benefited from a holistic initial view of the whole, but, come on! The same thing could be said of the ""Original Trilogy"", that one whose flaws are always systematically overlooked. The original movies presented us with crazy twists , such as: Vader being Luke's father, Leia suddenly becoming Luke's sister (they had kissed for Pete's sake!), the emperor's appearance being dramatically retconned with the skip from movie V to VI, amongst other things.<br /><br />II- A lot of the things in these movies are made up in a way so that Disney can sell a lot of toys and videogames. So what? There's always been a huge public that loves Star Wars toys and games. This dumb argument sounds almost as if coming from a socialist's mind imbued with a deep need of screwing up the capitalists' way of doing things. What the heck? And these same people complain about these movies having some sort of social inclusion agenda or the so called propaganda. Aren't communists supposed to like that anyway?<br /><br />III- Disney killed off my childhood heroes Luke, Leia and Han! What did you expect? The actors that portrayed these characters were basically catapulted out from retirement with contracts that I can only imagine were extremely convincing in financial terms. Did you think their characters were to live forever, aged as they were? It was actually impressive the studios managed to get these actors invested back in these characters they hadn't played for years nor probably had any hopes they'd ever play them again and, in the end, deliver to the public quite satisfying performances.",0

The only reason that there are plot elements that appear to be reaching is because they were given disservice by TLJ. If you can accept that before hand, you will be pleased with the outcome. Thank you Cast and Crew, that was the ending the true fans needed. It's a shame we had to watch a trilogy played out in two parts.",0
7066,7.0,"I went into this moving with heavy skepticism. I heavily disliked what J.J. Abrams did with the Force Awakens, it being completely unoriginal. And the Last Jedi, though original, still left unanswered questions, leaving the final movie as a keystone for the entire story.",1
7067,9.0,To give this movie any less than 6 out of ten is bizarre.<br /><br />Let's take it for what it's meant to be an all action Sci Fi film for kids.<br /><br />It's pretty much not stop action from the word go. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are excellent. I went to see the first Star Wars in 1977 and as a cinematic experience this film was comparable. Some breathtaking scenery and quite outstanding effects.<br /><br />Some people need to get a grip it's insulting to say this film is a one out of ten and quite pathetic.,0
7068,7.0,The Knights of Ren didn't matter. They were on vacation in TLJ.,0
7069,9.0,"While the plot and mechanics were overwhelmingly predictable and clunky, the overall structure of Rise of Skywalker was a gratifying resolution to the Skywalker saga.",0
7070,3.0,"The first 2 films were trash. This one was aligning to be trash too, but then the end of the movie came and had its bad moments but wasn't as bad as it could of been.<br /><br />I mean the kiss scene looked so pushed and didn't add anything special to the story. it was kinda like the end of the return of the jedi : the jedi makes the villan realize that he still has good in him and helps the jedi kill Sidius.<br /><br />BUT the upside is the part when all the jedi speak to rey trough the force with The Force theme song playing in the background. That was kinda epic.<br /><br />Lets talk about something. I wish that rey wasn't overpowered. I wish that she would have died right at the end. waaaay better ending. like bro she just defeated the most powerful sith of the galaxy and she did that with like a month of training. hell no.<br /><br />and don't get me started on how every body is dying. did rey being with them make them stupid or the fact that rey is with them makes them want to die, but why are they dying so redicusely?",0
7071,6.0,"The negative reviews just baffle me. This is excellent entertainment. Awesome special effects, suspense, it has it all. Maybe you find the story a bit thin, but rating this movie below 6/10 baffles me. What else do people expect?",1
7072,5.0,"It was amazing from the minute I sat down in the theater until I left .. It's still baffles me that people watch only the flaws in star wars any more.. People act like they are they know everything, and viciously hate new ideas and concepts with star wars movies and it's time you grew up and start looking at the wonder that is cause this movie has more awesome fan service because the last one was a fail.. This one has better action seasons more story and it actually feels like star wars again I love what J.J. Abrams did for it and everyone hated the one before this... And he fixed the problems with it by burring it in the dust.. And treated like the rest of us treated the Star Wars Holiday Special..",1
7073,9.0,"Story wise.. the score could be 6.5, but for the action, it is very good.<br /><br />Abrams try to keep the pace fast.. no delay no break, he was in a rush to finiish this movie as fast as possible..",1

7076,1.0,"I went into this film with fairly low expectations. For the most part I was surprised & it was better than expected.<br /><br />Yes- the script wasn't the best.<br /><br />Yes- it tried way too hard to cram every character into one film, dead or alive.<br /><br />Yes- the story was forced in many areas.<br /><br />Yes- too many leaps of faith.<br /><br />But the action, pace and scenes were filmed well and kept my interest. This film won't ever rank in the top 5 SW films, but it was entertaining nonetheless- as long as you don't expect too much from it.",1
7077,10.0,"It seems that many of the people commenting here are just trying to sabotage this trilogy. As someone wrote here ""To give this movie a rating 1/10 is just ridiculous."" and I agree.

7078,5.0,"Best star wars ever to watch in cinema, great experience. nicely ended the saga",1
7079,10.0,I can understand why the fans didn't like it but it must bu like that. J.J Abrahams wanted to add everything the fans wanted which makes the movie compicated. But nevertheless it is a beautiful ending that reflects the story of the characters and answers all questions.,1
7080,10.0,"It's hard to write a single review on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker because so much happens of so little consequence that it's almost impossible to pinpoint what to talk about and what to completely ignore.<br /><br />It was pretty well known that Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams royally screwed up when they didn't bother planning a three-movie franchise from the beginning of the first film's pre-production, even when George Lucas himself handed them a book full of ideas and a cohesive trilogy outline (they just threw that in the garbage). This screw up solidified with The Last Jedi, in which Kennedy just told Rian Johnson to just do whatever, nobody cares they'll buy it anyway. And they did buy it, since they didn't know what kind of disaster Rian had barfed into existence.<br /><br />With Last Jedi, those former fans know better, and considering what I'd seen, I'm glad, because even in trying to undo TLJ, it manages to be just as awful in its own special panicked neurotic way. I've never seen JJ Abrams trip on himself this clumsily since reluctantly directing Star Trek Into Darkness, and Into Darkness looks downright magnificent by comparison to this trash.<br /><br />I'll just skip to near the end when the truly heinous crap goes down.<br /><br />After a bunch of nonsensical romping through several equally forgettable planets and a handful of beloved character death fakeouts and one actual character death that should've happened in TLJ when Carrie Fisher actually passed away, Rey Skywalker Palpatine Solo finds out that Emperor Sheev Palpatine came back from the dead, cloned himself (which ended up being Snoke because of course it did), and had a kid who ended up giving birth to Rey. Kylo ""Ben Solo"" Ren Skywalker is still evil but also still in love (wait, JJ later confirmed that he was still in ""friendship"") with Rey. They end up fighting each other, who cares, blah blah blah, and then Kylo fights Sheev, who throws him down a cliff or something. Then Rey uses two lightsabers to knock Sheev's lightning back at him until he doesn't exist anymore and then dies.<br /><br />Then Kylo comes back and uses force healing to bring her back, and then he dies.<br /><br />Then Rey decides her name is Skywalker.<br /><br />The End.<br /><br />Pad that with a bunch of useless spectacle nonsense and you have the epic conclusion to the Skywalker saga: a movie that managed to be worse than Phantom Menace. Well done.",0
7081,8.0,That being said what we end up with is a vast improvement when compared to TLJ but that isn't hard. Even the old Ewok films are preferable to TLJ and that's saying something lol.,0
7082,3.0,"This is Star Wars. Better then most worse then some. I really think the internet as well as the age you saw your first Star Wars movie impacts how you see your fandom. I'm old enough to remember going to the ""new hope"" before it was ""the new hope"". All other movies that came after were derivative. I hated empire, mainly for its cliff hanger ending, but as soon as return of the Jedi came out...empire became my second favorite starwars. Damn I hated the Ewoks...and whaaaat??? Brother and sister. Twins???? Pffft! Then the prequels came out. And suddenly return was my third favorite. Wf! Trade arguments??? Politics??? The ""acting"". Jar Jar??????? Hun-be-weeebable!! And on and on. I could believe people LOVED the prequels.... I still can't (why oh why isn't Mr Binks a sith. I had such high hopes.). The sequal trilogy annoyed me. A retelling of the first trilogy in the first movie of the last? The horrors! The the second movie.... uggghhh. What did they do to Luke?? It was like watching a space version of speed 2....agonizing. Now the final movie comes along. Hmmmm, and you know what....all the complaints people have about it.... I've see them all before .... cause baby... that's Star Wars! Plot holes, jumping around, cute pointless characters, relationships that go no where, super (force) powers never seen before manifesting, ""fan service""... all of it. I don't care. I DONT CARE. I love it. I'll never be 13 again. I'll never see it for the first time with amazement and wonder. But it is what starwars is. What it was. What it always will be. Could it have been better... sure... but what couldnt. It's been a long run. It's finally over. Until they maybe the next sequel... or pre-prequel. And unless I'm dead, I'll be in line.",0

7084,8.0,"So, as a child, i was enthralled with Star Wars. The lasers, the action, the roller coaster feeling. I have re watched the movies. As an adult and while they bring fond memories, lets be honest. Plot holes, some silliness, plot holes the size of the death star.",1
7085,8.0,JJ did a fantastic job. Hold tight because the ride takes you on a great journey.,1
7086,8.0,Ignore the saddos that complain their childhood has been destroyed by Disney. Probably still hurt from the last jedi. Brilliant ending. Nuff said.,1
7087,10.0,"The last installation of this new trilogy starts out feeling very messy. The movie picks up the pace straight away and for the first half of its duration it doesn't lift its foot from the pedal. The effect is that whereas good story telling would require buildup, suspense and surprises being satisfied with explanations, the movie opts for simply squeezing the plot into a time frame it can't possibly fit. Much of what happens we never see the characters truly react to, because there simply is no time for them to do so before jumping on to the next major event. For the same reason many of the characters are pushed entirely to the sidelines to make room for new (or old) ones, and the point of having them there in the first place is not obvious.",0
7088,10.0,"I too really hated Last Jedi and I was concerned that Rise of Skywalker would be just as bad, but it's actually really good. Lots of great scenes, very little fluff and lots of darkness. If you wait to see it on Disney+ or Netflix I guarantee you will be thinking at the end, ""I should have seen this on the big screen"".",1
7089,6.0,"As my ""title"" epitomizes it, this is not a movie but an insult to the art of cinema.<br /><br />This is just a series of video-clips. ""The Rise Of Skywalker"" is the epitome of absurdity. The whole ""sequel"" trilogy was exactly that but this one brings things to a whole new level for sure.",1
7090,8.0,"Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were formulaic. A brilliant formula with heroes, good v evil, sacrifice and friendship. A big bad thing (deathstar) overcome by a small band of rebels. The prequels lost sight of this and were poor as a result. The most recent trilogy embraced the formula and I for one loved them. I have been a massive fan since the original film, The Rise of Skywalker was predictable for me, and joyously so! I loved seeing aspects of the previous films played out again! The characters mirroring those from the first 3, situations playing out almost (but not quite) as they have before. That is Star Wars, and Rise of Skywalker was triumphant in this. An extremely emotional end to a 40+ year obsession! Go and watch it, but watch with the eyes of a child, not a critic (remember these are and always have been kids movies), and if you do you'll love it!!!!!",1
7091,1.0,Unspeakable horrors from outer space paralyze the living and resurrect the dead! You may recognize this tagline from the Ed Wood turkey 'Plan 9 from outer space' but it is basically the plot of 'Rise of Skywalker'. The dead speak! Palpatine is back from the dead and trying to corrupt the galaxy from the super secret sith home world of Exegol.,0
7092,8.0,This is the worst Star Wars movie of the whole lot. I wish Disney never bought the franchise and ruined it. George Lucas must regret selling such a wonderful franchise. There is nothing good about this movie.,0

7094,3.0,Overall a good film! Don't listen to the critics or the reviews. Go watch the movie and decide for yourself how you feel. It's a great popcorn movie with twists and turns. The nostalgia will hit you and it does not follow the beats of movies past. Is it a perfect movie? No it's a pretty great one though and it sure as Hell isn't a 1/10 or even a 5/10. But please go and decide for yourself!,1
7095,6.0,"It's what you exept when you see a Star Wars movie. You feel amazed of seeing the sequence of the movie and the growth of the characters. However, the build to this movie just fell short due to the lack of an epic conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.",0

7098,1.0,"I loved the movie, jj abrams gave the respect that all the old characters and the original story deserved. It feels that it was done by somebody who really loves Star Wars. He also presented the new gang as imperfect as they might be. Ben and Rey were absolutely amazing. I wouldn't add or take out anything from it. I loved all the bits and pieces that he used referencing the original movies. The respect for Carrie Fisher by only using original footage is heart warming.",1

This movie started off amazingly and ended how we all dreamt for it to end. They couldn't do much after the failure of last jedi but what they did in the movie was immaculate. They did need room for improvements but this has been the best ""lightsaber"" Star wars since episode 6 with a nice flowing story.",1
7101,1.0,Spent majority of this rolling my eyes in absolute disgust. Ruined the Skywalker Saga.,0
7102,10.0,I think this movie is enjoyable. It suffers due to its predecessor establishing very little. Plot points come thick and fast. It is true it panders to fans but well... why not.,1
7103,1.0,"A character claims the second Death Star/Battle of Endor is where the ""last war ended."" In actuality, in the canon expanded universe, the war went on for another year, culminating with the Battle of Jakku and the subsequent Imperial surrender. As Disney spearheaded their own expanded universe and undid all that had come before, it's odd they'd make this mistake.",1
7104,8.0,"I will not be the one guy or *$$crack fan who spoils it. I am huge fan of the entire Star Wars universe. I will not get into any debates or knowledge contests. I will say however... that The Rise of Skywalker Delivered on all levels. I felt sad that it was finally over but relieved it was given the artistic justice it deserved. Fanboys and overly critical fans can say all they want, let artists be artists and lets be grateful we have this form of entertainment. Id recommend you watch this and remember there is a huge difference between books, comics, and movies. So do not expect that all, that was just fan theory that went to far and some had the audacity to try and expand the universe. It was fans themselves who created the holes in the entire story. Thank you J.J Abrams for a great movie... story and a graceful end to a series that could have destroyed itself by continuing. Like a particular car movie that had to do with being fast and not furious or something like that. 10 thumbs up to the Rise of Skywalker",0
7105,10.0,"Okay folks, my turn to give a review. If you want a real review just go see the film for yourself and you be the judge. As a Star Wars fan since the original trilogy and as a fan who owned all the merchandise from action figures, to bed sheets, pajamas, toothpaste, underwear, and the books with the cassette tape... This film was iffy for the first half (Meaning as a comparison to all the others) However, the last hour or more and the ending made up for the sluggish start... The first movie I ever seen in the theater was Return of the Jedi. Return of the Jedi was the only film I ever went to where people were clapping and cheering at the end of the film. Almost 40 years later it happened again and it just happened to be at a Star Wars movie. The first half of the film Id give a 6/10. The second half an 8/10...This would give the film a 7/10... However, it Star Wars so Ill give it an extra point. I rate this film an 8/10..My honest critique of this film as a whole after seeing it just once..Its better the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Solo, and The Last Jedi...So it ranks probably in the middle of the 11 films...",0

7112,6.0,The Rise of Skywalker. Episode IX. The Finale. The end of an era.<br /><br />The final film in the long anticipated series of Star Wars did perhaps bring the story full circle and to a close (which appears to be most temporary). But it did so in near the exact same fashion as the past.,1
7113,8.0,"The last installment of the four decade Skywalker saga concludes the epic tale of The Skywalker family.

In the end I think he does and felt a lot like the first film. Definitely a film for the fans and makes LJ redundant.<br /><br />So don't look to hard at plot holes or terribly written dialogue. Just enjoy the spectacle. Of u enjoyed the first film and hated the second like me. You will be OK with this. Ignore the 1 /10,1

7119,7.0,"It is so sad that the only thing that disney wants is to make money. This is not what Walt Disney would have wanted. Close to nothing in this movie makes sense. First- Palpatine comes out of the dead from no where, destroying everything the first 6 movies and everything Anakin has done, unraveling all the beautiful work they have done. Kylo is pushed into a cave and survived somehow. Then Rey is killed but brought back to life by Ren. Only Darth Plageius had this power! Then Palpatine, is killed by magic in 2 minutes, something that Yoda, Mace Windu and so many other powerful Jedi couldn't do. Then it's revealed that Leia was trained as a Jedi. Since when did Luke have time to train her and if she was, why didn't she just fight the first order herself instead of sending everyone off to find Luke. Then, somehow a bunch of horses (Yes horses) were galloping off the first of a star destroyer... that was the most lame scene I have ever seen. How do horses stay on? Total Crap- close to no one died while trying to fight ""the most dangerous fleet in the entire galaxy""? Finally, what made no sense is was the title- the rise of skywalker. The last two Skywalkers died (Leia and Ben) and only Rey changed her name which felt cringe. Shout out to the score tho and I enjoyed the fact we ended on Tattoine, the only thing Disney got right. But overall this was super disappointing and proves that Disney isn't about the magic and more about the money.",0
7120,9.0,"Based on the on-line reviews for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I had low expectations for this movie and believed that a key issue with all recent Star Wars Universe movies could be attributed to the presence and restrictions / limitations Kathleen Kennedy placed on the creative nature and visions of the directors!",0
7121,3.0,Just as I was expecting. I read all the spoiler reviews before seeing this so I wouldn't be as disappointed.<br /><br />This series of newer movies basically is pointless as exactly the same things happen and they just reuse all of the same plots. If you want to just be entertained it's a good movie. Just don't take it too seriously. The baddies always die in the end.,0

But to be honest I don't care, it's an epic film with a good storyline, that introduces some nice new characters and explores old ones that were left behind. Abrams did play it safe with this movie and he did undo a lot of the mistakes made in The Last Jedi, if you enjoyed that film (which I have to admit I did not) you may be disappointed in how it was overturned, but I for one am glad as I think they made a mistake when it came to many important storylines.",1

JJ abrams clearly understands the Star Wars universe and fans far more than Rian Johnson. It blows my mind that episode 9 currently sits at a 7 here on IMDB while the objectively disastrous film that is episode 8 is a 7.1. When you scroll through the reviews for episode 8 the vast majority are rated 3 or below. While episode 9 has a comfortable range from 5-10, decent by IMDB review standards. What's going on here? The ratings don't add up. Why is the tomatometer critic score so low for episode 9 while episode 8 was high, ranking amongst the dark knight and other legendary films. The tomatometer audience score is the exact opposite to the critics. Low for 8 and high for 9. Look it up for yourselves! These critics are useless, who pays them? Episode 8 should be carved out and rewritten to mesh with 7 and 9. As for me and my family the Star Wars sequels currently only consist of 7 and 9. Episode 8 is simply summed up as ""Luke dies by using the force to hard and Snoke is killed by Kylo"". No need to put anyone through the pain of watching episode 8, also known as, the attempted assassination of the Star Wars saga.",1

7136,10.0,"None of you have any right to complain if you didn't like the Last Jedi. This had everything you asked for and it was a messy. Why? Because what fans want is a mess. The film itself is competent with great action sequences, great score, and great acting (although some of the dialogue was forced). It tried to fix everything that the fans hated about TLJ, but that made some of the plot a bit unnecessary. Liked the various worlds introduced, but it caused the film to feel a bit rushed. Glad the three main characters were together. Most of the issues may have been due to rushed production. Abrams wanted more time to finish it. Overall, I think it was decent.

7145,6.0,"New trilogy, new story. One that had minor to none influence of George Lucas but one that respected and reminded us of his great creation. The SW Universe.<br /><br />Yes, disney got their hands on it, Star Wars is everywhere, not all of it is good, some is actually really bad, but lets talk about the Rise of Skywalker.<br /><br />The story may not have been the one we wanted, palpatine returns?? What about ROTJ? Anakins legacy that relies on killing the emperor, all for nothing ? Yes, i agree, they could have done it differently.<br /><br />Given the story and plot they chose to present to us.. This movie is a MASTERPIECE. It's not a kids movie where lightsaber fights are cool. Its not a spectacular CGI demonstration. It's the score we love, the environment we love, the characters we love, and, most importantly, each character has so much complexity, for them to still understand, for us to understand and for us to identify ourselves in.<br /><br />It's the universe we love, in a story about friendship, love, about what's right and wrong. Not only this movie is amazing, it's the only Star Wars that genuinely explores feelings and characters in such a deep way.<br /><br />Star wars was never about lightsabers and stardestroyers, that made it better, for sure, but not what it was all about.<br /><br />This movie is STAR WARS. Maybe not the best, but could easily be.<br /><br />If you didn't like this movie, i feel sorry for you because you were a fan... One who never understood what Star Wars was all about...",1

7147,10.0,"It does have many plotholes and does rush it a bit, but overall a very fun story, and unlike the last jedi the characters actually some chemistry between them and they all have good character development, Kylo Ren was probably the best chracter in the movie and his redemption into Ben Solo was very smart, Billy Dee Williams was amazing as Lando despite having limited screen time and not playing the character in nearly 40 years, Ian Mcderman was able to reprise his role as Palpatine very well. Palpatine was a bit underused but with what we got with him, from sucking the life essence out of people to shooting lightning that destroyed entire fleets we should be pretty happy, obviously people including me wanted Anakin to be the one to destroy Palpatine, but I guess in a way he did. Alot of cool and epic moments that gave people goosebumps just like Endgame (won't go into it cause it would be too long). The film had moments that made people cry. The movie has some problems which was inevitable, but a good movie, check it out and form your own opinion, don't mind the negative reviews, they make little sense.",1

7149,9.0,"I went into this movie with extremely low expectations given the recent press and preliminary reviews that had been released. While I was never the biggest fan of the new trilogy I didn't vehemently hate it as it seemed so many other passionate fans did online. With the Rise of Skywalker marking the end of this trilogy, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I must say that in the end I walked away being thoroughly impressed despite the overarching generic feel to the film as a whole.",0
7150,2.0,"This movie is pretty good compared to what we got before it. It still has its flaws, but JJ could have done so much more if they didn't have to spend so much time fixing what the Last Jedi destroyed. I felt like this made the movie a little jumpy or fast at times. I also think that a few of the events in the movie could've been executed differently or better. Overall, the movie was pretty enjoyable. In my opinion, it is the best of the Disney trilogy. You might not totally agree with some of it but it's still a Star Wars movie after all is said and done.",1

7153,7.0,"Actually, for me, the only reason for me to watch this movie is simply because of the fan services, especially after I heard from the leaks on reddit that anakin would appear verbally. However, it would be much better if anakin as a force ghost and baby (or teenage) yoda appeared in the movie, I would probably rate this 10 out of 10. For the story plot, frankly speaking, I don't care as the existence of the entire trilogy is unnecessary and meaningless.",0

7155,6.0,The culmination of the hole star wars saga. Rests in the very capable hands of ray. Was very good love the action and drama. Was very fast paced. But not too fast paced if you have been following the story up till now.,1

7157,8.0,"The first hour or so felt rushed and poorly written. About half way through the movie the pace slowed. I was able to enjoy the film a little bit more. At some point in the movie (right the third cameo) I was wondering how many old actors are going to be in this movie. Most of this film was fan service at the cost of cohesive storytelling. I was glad, though, to have the questions from Force Awakes answered but it could have been done in a more intriguing way. This installment of the saga wasn't all bad. It was definitely better than TLJ. The Force Awakens was way better.",0
7158,9.0,"This was a really well done movie. Especially when compared to Lucas' mess of Episodes 1-3. JJ Abrams and especially the cast did a great job closing out the story. Yes it's a money making franchise by Disney Corp, but what company doesn't want to make money? I especially enjoy how they've gone away from 95% CGI and gone more prop old school. Much more realistic and enjoyable.",1

7161,2.0,"The movie felt very excessive and overdone to me. The pace was way too hectic and it was very ""loud"". Felt like 70% of the movies were explosions and such (though I loved the sound design - as always.) WARNING! Spoilers ahead! Couple of scenes I remember that I didn't like: It would have fit way better if Rey would have actually killed Chewy accidently (because she didn't have her powers under control), imo. The kiss between Rey and Ben was unnecessary and somehow disgusting because it felt like they had more like a brother-sister bond to me. Rey should have told the old lady that her name is Rey Palpatine because that would have shown that she finally found out where she is coming from and that she sort of washed the name clean.",1
7162,3.0,"Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing and underwhelming movie in total. There are some good parts, some bad, but the cons outweigh the pros here. A bit on background information, I had originally planned to see the movie in theaters but left the theater early, which was a pretty good choice now that I think on it. I then decided to wait and watch the movie on one of the video streaming platforms like Netflix or Prime Video. So, I waited a bit, and by a bit I mean a long while, into about late 2020. During this time, I watched a few reviews on the movie, and read some of the IMDB reviews for the movie. When looking at the amount of anger directed towards the movie itself, me, being an OT fan, almost died of laughter. You might be wondering why I was enjoying the criticism towards the 3rd movie in the Disney trilogy, and it has to do with the Last Jedi. When I first watched Last Jedi, it seemed like something important was missing. There were some good parts, sure, but there was the bad too. Unlike about half of the Star Wars fanbase, I didn't directly hate the movie. I instead felt like it wasn't bad, but instead lacking a few important things. The Disney Trilogy has been a bit shaky recently, but there was at least one awesome movie in the Disney Trilogy, maybe you might have guessed it by now. That movie was The Force Awakens, and I liked it. The Force Awakens was such a good movie to watch, and in my opinion, was the best movie in the whole trilogy. The funny thing, in my opinion, is that the quality of the Disney Trilogy decreased by each movie. The Force Awakens was an excellent start to the trilogy, The Last Jedi carried it on subpar, and the Rise of Skywalker was the biggest failure of a Star Wars movie I have ever seen. Now that I have talked a bit on why I prefer other Star Wars movies, and why I naturally dislike most of the Disney Trilogy, lets get on to the real review.",0
7163,5.0,"There's no question this movie will divide fans. That rift carries over from The Last Jedi which threw out much of the lore behind the characters and universe, as well as many of the plot threads of The Force Awakens.",1
7164,3.0,"I'm a big fan of sequel trilogy with the last jedi My favorite movie and kylo my favorite character. All on the internet about how much bad new movies are is an overreaction from the star wars audience that simply is not satisfied with anything. The movie takes place a year after the events of the previous one and gives you how the resistance has been reborn and how rey is trying to become a jedi, I can't say much because the movie is full of twists and I'll spoil them. I have to say that the movie has AMAZING CGI which many people consider to be a given but not for me (CGI despair is one of the reasons I hate prequel trilogy). Since I mentioned the CGIs Carrie you do not understand that it is fake and the movie gives a fine role to Leia. The movie has nice lightsaber duels, a great cameo, the best space fight ever and is, I think, the nicest closure a saga could have. I have two negatives about something that started the film and it didn't go anywhere and something else but I can't tell them why spoilers (not something special). Finally, is it the best Star Wars? The answer is maybe. I've seen the last jedi five or six times and I've been up there, I have to see it two or three times.",1
7165,9.0,Such a let down. Was expecting a lot more from the conclusion of this trilogy. I think it's plainly obvious that they went into these films with no plan and no idea how to stick the landing.,0
7166,7.0,These comments kill. If you so called true Star Wars fans learned anything over the last few decades it's to not over analyze the movies because they just are what they are. The Star Wars team wrapped it up with a great ending and that's hard to do. They get 9 stars just for doing that. Kudos!,1
7167,3.0,"Great way to end the series. Nice that they didn't throw away Last Jedi, but returned some hope to the Galaxy.",1
7168,9.0,"Great movie, double great special effects. The only problem is that, how do you wrap up a series that is 40 years old, think James Bond dieing. J J A did a very good job and I was..... satisfied. The Force Awakens remains the best of the trilogy.... just!",1
7169,10.0,"Look, guys, I'm not a hater or something. Actually, this is my first review on IMDB for a whole life. I'm a simple 35 years old guy from Russia who grew up on the original Star Wars saga. These new episodes, after the relaunch, were just okay, I guess. Nothing special, but nothing critical as well. But when I watched the latest episode of the whole saga, I cried. It was so disappointing and so bad. You shouldn't have ended the whole story this way. It's just wrong. You ruined the entire legacy of the original episodes. I wish to erase my memory and never watch Star Wars created by Disney again.",0
7170,9.0,"This is a good movie, I wonder if there Disney haters are just trying to poison the buzz. It had a really satisfactory ending.",0
7171,1.0,"Having just watched this film, I have to say it was a lot better than expected. When the force awakens came out, people didn't like it was a carbon copy of a new hope. So long and behold, this film dares to be very different and some people are never happy. It's the modern day troll or tantrum I like to call it. For me this was the true sequel to the force awakens and it passed my expectations which was low after the last Jedi.<br /><br />It was a beautiful looking film, music score on point. Old characters stood strong, new ones fitted the world and JJ learnt from his mistakes from the force awakens. It was a big step forward and for me, ended the saga (skywalker) story perfectly. Plus showing respect to those who have fallen and sadly passed away. This film doesn't deserve hate and certianly the best star wars film by far in this new Trilogy. Plus in the top 4 star wars films for me (4th spot)<br /><br />Happily watch again and enjoy the second viewing.",1
7172,8.0,"So I'm Mark Hamill, I actually am. But not that one. Thus I've been invested since the first one, as seen several times in 1977. To summarise - the original trilogy was perfect, episodes 1 - 3 had some awesome moments (Darth Maul) but was mainly awful (midiclorians anyone?). The 'Rey' story arc looked great, brought back the soul of the originals, but unfortunately just repeated the plots with ever more overblown set pieces. As an aside - what l don't understand is why do force ghosts not seem stupid in the original series, but are so corny in episode 8 & 9. Overall comment though, don't think too hard just enjoy the ride.",1

7175,8.0,"I went into this movie as a ""pupil"" of the force. Although I've read about 50% of the collected works about Star Wars legends and current Disney canon, every new force power introduced here has been introduced somewhere in the lore. I felt connected to the characters and this is a huge improvement from any other star wars. Disney made this movie fun, adventurous, unbelievable (it's not real anyway), and moving. I am on cloud 9 after watching this. Watch this movie for the right reasons, and you will find yourself smiling, on the edge of your seat, and maybe even a little emotionally drawn in.",1
7176,6.0,"**SPOILERS**<br /><br />The revival of Palpatine is poorly explained and seems out of touch with the previous movies and this contributes to the feeling that the trilogy as a whole is incoherent and makes it incredibly clear that it was unplanned. This is unfortunate - look at The Mandalorian: a planned out story which is an incredible example of SW story-telling.<br /><br />Also, as a big fan I take issue with the inconsistencies with EU lore - Chewie already had a medal, why call it a wayfinder and not a holocoron?, there are questions over the use of force ghosts",0
7177,10.0,"Cards on the table: I think the sequel trilogy sucks donkey's. TFA is a lazy boring retread of ANH. TLJ is a very strange film riddled with: plot-holes, baffling character motivations, lore-breaking, terrible 'jokes'; and it holds a giant middle-finger up to a bulk of the fans. There was almost no way the final installment could be any good and so it proved. TROS is a poorly paced cluster that makes little to no sense. The pace of the film is so dizzying that I challenge anyone who has only seen the film once to recount the plot. About half the film is a tedious coupon chase that a video-game story-teller would be ashamed of. The other half seems to be obsessed with retcon-ing TLJ and the story told by episodes 1-6. There were at least 4 fake-out deaths - the laziness is strong in this one. I've given the film 5/10 because there were a few things I liked (e.g. it's very pretty). I'm gonna need to watch it again at least once (preferably on 3/4 speed) to decide how hate-able it is.",0
7178,8.0,"I had low expectations because of the films before, but this blew my mind. Throwbacks and voices gave me chills! The back and forth between evil/good Rey/Ben was exciting and I didn't feel like I knew what was gonna happen - the way it has been with the other Disneyfied films. This movie deserves a better score. Don't hate on this movie because you hate the others.",1
7179,3.0,"Don't believe the critics - it covers a lot and does a good job ending the saga and smoothing over some of the TLJ 'issues'. Special effects are fantastic, and his handling of Leia was very well done (with what he had), one of my few issues is there is a lot crammed into this movie and it could have been split into 2 or more movies. JJ does a great job covering a number of questions and does it in a way that should make all SW fans (except the 'Hate Sheep') proud!",1

7182,3.0,"A satisfying end to the saga that wraps up all nine films nicely. Whilst the story stumbles on occasion and goes a bit over the top at the end, the film boasts a variety of epic and tense battles and fight scenes that are both entertaining and emotional throughout. The performances from cast members old and new are generally fantastic, the characters play off each other well and are all more interesting and entertaining this time around, right down to C3PO they are all a joy to watch. The effects, set and costume designs are fantastic, the film looks beautiful all the way through but, while most revelations and twists were well done some were more predictable and played it too safe.<br /><br />Not the best film Star Wars has to offer but great fun that brings the saga full circle and ties everything together, great to watch as a triple bill will be watching it again.",1

Great star wars film if you are a fan.",1

There is only one thing that I did not like and it was the fact that they made Leia a jedi (it fills that they only did it because the actress died). I like that they brought back Darth Sidious and they use it really well. It did not feel like the proper ending, but they had to work with the mess they had from the previous film. I would have liked it more if they used more scenes of Luke instead of Leia. The fights were great, the characters were great and the story was great. The Knights of Ren could also have appeared for a longer time, and also I would have prefered that Kylo Ren never switched sides so that he as a sith and Rey as a jedi could bring balance together.",1

7200,6.0,"Before I went in I had low low expectations, I could not see how anyone could fix the problems and choices Rian Johnson has made for this trilogy but boy Abrams and that guy who wrote Argo and a few crappy DC movies not only fixes it but knocks it into the stratosphere.<br /><br />It's a Fast paced movie that crams a lot in to it's 2 hour and 30 minutes, but the pay off is beautiful, this for me this is seriously a Christmas miracle. Everything that bothered me about the last Jedi is addressed, and actually makes that movie watchable. He takes a few liberties but nothing that Johnson had not already done x10. We get answers, we get twists and we get closure. But we also get a really really Dark twisted movie, with so much beauty, Thank you Abrams, you dun good, forget an Oscar this guy should be given a medal! For me it's a 10/10 and I went back the next morning to see it again, this ranks in my top 3 Star Wars movies.",1

7204,10.0,"I have always loved the star wars films. The fundamental theme of the films is good verses evil. Heros rising to meet challenges and characters working together to beat the bad guys. This film had a huge job to do, to finish a 9 film saga and please all the fans. The latter was never going to happen. There will always be fans who have imagined the direction they would want the films to take and are upset when it didn't pan out that way. I had no idea what was going to happen. I wanted to go in and be entertained, I wanted a tied up finish and questions answered. I wanted nods to the fans and to see characters old and new come<br /><br />together to beat evil - I got that, so I am a happy fan.<br /><br />The film was exciting, emotional (especially the Leia scenes) and tense.

7206,9.0,"JJ Abrams did a good and enjoyable job on the first one so Disney must have destroyed this one, maybe it would make more sense if it was 3.5h long cut, but in this form it is just a stream of constant mess. My impression was that no location is shown for more than a minute and the plot is forced to move on and suddenly jumps. Event A happens and 5 minutes later event B happens that negates event A, rinse and repeat. Not enough to get you in the mood. Maybe you will love it if you watch it high on cocaine. I gave it 6 purely for nostalgia.",0

7221,9.0,Before I begin let me say that I was a fan of Episode VII. It was a very enjoyable film. While The Last Jedi was also a well crafted movie it undid the setup of Episode VII.,1
7222,8.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes this movie was probably a little bit too much on the action side and not enough story development, but that's how things are done these days. For me this was a good old popcorn film. I look forward to watching it again.",1
7223,8.0,"This movie should be separated into two parts.<br /><br />The parts before Rey walk into debris of the second Death Star was too fast:talk too fast,cut too fast , which made me cannot keep up with.<br /><br />The parts after that,J.J. tried to show the audience the functionality of the force.Yet, I thought his way was too rough to catch my mind.In this points,I thought Rian did it better.<br /><br />To sum up,this is a good movie worth twice watching for the massive content.But I have to say the way reintroduce the Emperor wasn't good enough to show his ambition,but just made him ""another final villain""again.",0

As I told my son earlier, the people complaining about this movie aren't hard core fans - they are hard core big babies that don't like anything. A true fan from the original trilogy would recognize and love ever aspect of this movie. The theater we saw it in was packed and filled with cheers and every other emotion for the ride of our life. Way to go!",1
7225,7.0,Wtf is all I have to say about this. Watch it and you will see what I mean.,0
7226,10.0,"Not only did this trilogy not need to exist, but this film was the worst of the new trilogy. Because, while last Jedi was too ambitious, it hit simultaneously hit the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows. It sucked, but at least it had some originality (looking at you Force Awakens).",0
7227,1.0,"I really enjoyed this movie.Daisy Ridley nailed the part.(although some of her light saber moves could have been more fluent,though she is a young jedi and she got to finish off the villain at the end.)",1
7228,4.0,Words fail me... the wrongs of the previous two films could of been corrected... but there was just more stupid canon breaking moments...running along the outside of a ship... silly find quests.... plot holes... George must be so disappointed or rolling around in so much cash he just doesn't care,0
7229,10.0,"Just because this movie is not as good as the first trilogy, it is a really fun and emotionally investing movie that everyone should see, if you don't like the new trilogy you may not want to see this one, but it does help reverse some of the bad parts from last jedi. Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker is a great movie to to be overlooked despite the bad reviews.",1
7230,3.0,"I saw the original New Hope as a little kid in the theater and have seen everyone in the theater since. Yes, I was originally a hater of the prequals, sans ""Revenge of the Sith"". I learned my lesson. Star Wars is meant to just be fun it is an elevated kids movie. Having said this there are a few things that I would like to say. SPOILERS AHEAD. Rise of skywalker has some amazing moments, However, its over use of the Hand of God technique. For those of you that don't know about this its essentially a greek play way of just saving someone out of an unsaveable situation ie. Harry Potter and the spiders, kids are for sure going to die in the woods and boom car comes out of no where with no explanation to save them. Where was I, Oh Rise of skywalker doesn't just overuse this it banks almost every scene on this, really breaks down suspended disbelief. I think this is a universal gripe with the movie. Another issue I had was, that while I loved homage to every movie they missed a big one. Blow a planet or a death star up at the end. It felt like with all of the winks to the series was given that was a big miss, lets see the sith planet blow up like the death star. In the end my friend Bill comes to save everyone with his review of the prequels, I asked what he thought and he said, ""Best cartoon I have ever seen."" Star wars is for kids and go there as a kid, don't ask questions, have fun, eat some popcorn. It's meant to be fun, not sipped like a fine wine.",1
7231,9.0,"To be honest this movie was great, have your own opinion don't listen to all these haters.<br /><br />And btw I grew up with Star Wars and I still think it's great.",1
7232,8.0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It had some amazing bits, great action...and plenty for the older Star Wars fan (like me). It is however geared for the kids of today, which is what it should be.",1
7233,9.0,"This was a great movie overall. Loved the storyline. Very high paced all the way through however it didn't let up at all and maybe it should have a bit to let the story breathe a little. I saw that many others felt the same way. Think of it as one really big non-stop roller coaster. Definitely lots of fan service stuff - maybe a little bit too much, and some of it went a little bit too far and were unnecessary which you'll likely understand when you see it (no spoilers here). I JJ Abrams needs to learn to pull back just a tiny bit. Also thought that a few scenes were a bit too cheesy for my liking and as well a few scenes were trademark JJ Abrams in the way they were filmed. This is after all JJ Abrams so I guess this is to be expected? Will I see it again? Ya most likely. A 7.0 out of 10 for me.",1
7234,8.0,"The movie is just good as before, and I like this movie tha make my emotion getting high. The awesome movie will take your family get known to the next generation. Don't get mad to me, I like sci-fi wars like TA:EG, and it's pretty sad when the one character we love died (I don't give her/his name to spoil you until you watch Star Wars).",1
7235,7.0,"The movie was great!<br /><br />The cinematography, the music, the action sequences, the fight scenes, it was all great!",1
7236,8.0,"As a start I would like to say that I'm a fan of The Last Jedi and I think it's one of the best Star Wars movies. However, I anticipated that The Rise of Skywalker would retcon the ideas and themes of its predecessor in order to appeal to the fans who, to say the least, have problems with it, and that disturbs me a little bit. I wrote what I liked the most about that movie and then some other thoughts I have.",1
7237,8.0,"First things first. Let us talk about the movie itself, without taking into consideration the big title ""Star Wars"".<br /><br />The movie begins with a slow rhythm. The first 30 minutes or so feel slow and maybe sleepy. Maybe it is the editing that makes it sort off boring. The editing in the first part of the movie feels odd. Weird cuts and transitions make the movie feel fast and at the same time slow. What do I mean? Simple. The story is slow, but weird cuts make it jump fast from one thing to another. So it is a story being told by several turtles. One second you are watching Ren doing some fancy stuff and the other second you are watching Rey doing some other fancy stuff.",0
7238,6.0,I went in ready to hate this movie but ended up loving it. It's fast paced and fun. My jaw dropped twice which has never happened to me before. To me this movie fixed all the problems of the last Jedi and exceeded my expectations.,1
7239,7.0,"Can't really believe what people are saying about the film. As part of the Star Wars franchise, it fits in so well for me. Ever since Force Awakens, diehard fans keep picking each film apart, and regardless of watching the films BEFORE or AFTER reading reviews, these same reviews kind of ruin the magic of it. Basic terms - I'm just a young person, heading towards 20s, and honestly can no longer be bothered to say ""but it missed out this... they didn't even write it the way the fans wanted it"" - I used to, and know 15 yr old me does my head in a little. Because, that's what you could say about any franchise which goes on for over 40 years! 😂 they are gonna get some things a bit wrong, in the opinion of others. I'm not saying people are wrong for having an opinion and believing the films aren't as great as they could have been.<br /><br />But being my age, having the memories I do of watching these films with family and friends who have passed away since, is important - probably many others could relate to that. So, summarising... I think people do need to step back a little, stop picking apart something so many actors, crew and others have worked so hard on to give an audience something memorable, funny, and lovable. Besides, we'll always have the Ewoks, man!<br /><br />(Watch it, love/hate it. Just respect it and most importantly Carrie Fisher!!)",1
7240,10.0,"After seeing the film I can say that visually it is spectacular (as it should be with Disney). The music as well, was fantastic as well as all the nods to the original series. However, the first 1/3-1/2 of the movie finding the way finder felt way too rushed. I feel like if they had put (or at least introduced this plot line) in TLJ instead of the casino plot line then continued it here and fleshed it out more, both movie would have benefited much much more. The second half of the movie was much better, and clearly what JJ wanted it to be like if he had gotten his way. However there were still a couple things that leave you questioning why??? Much better than the previous, glad the series ended on a somewhat positive note. Overall 6.75/10",0
7241,10.0,The Clone Wars makes Star Wars as it is today make so much sense. And that makes it epic. And then re-watch the prequels - you'll want to. I just watched this movie again having now seen all of the Clone Wars - and I was watching a film that's on a whole different level. Before Clone Wars this movie was a 6/10 for me. Now it's between a 9 and 10/10. Do it for yourself.,1
7242,7.0,I find this real entertaining from beginning to end. Good job!,1
7243,10.0,I enjoyed watching The Rise of Skywalker it was a fun movie with mostly good CGI but I hated the Ending and here is why:,1
7244,6.0,Some ok action but on the whole the film felt really slow in parts with parts added that didn't really have any impact to the story. Could of been alot better,0
7245,7.0,"Do not listen to the over critical nonsense. This movie is exactly what was going to happen, given the amount of content that had to be covered. It is a fast paced, action and substance packed roller coaster that delivers what it needed to. It is a lot of content and will take time to digest. Honestly, I want to see it again because of all the things. Yes, there are multiple times where pandering to fans is obvious. You can't please everyone. However, overall it is a satisfactory movie that concludes the Skywalker saga.",0
7246,5.0,Fun...Yes<br /><br />Wraps up the trilogy....Yes<br /><br />Rounds out all the characters.....Yes,1
7247,8.0,"I liked it and for all it's faults and plot holes the latest, and sadly last, entry in to the Skywalker saga is a great film!",1
7248,8.0,"Saw this at midnight as has been tradition since the originals were re-relased in the late '90s and this is my favourite SW since. Undid all the complicated, boring trash of TLJ with exactly what we go to see SW for: action, adventure, fun and to see some familiar (and new) heroes.<br /><br />It's biggest flaw is that it's perhaps a little too 'fan-servicey' but that's also one of its greatest strengths. JJ gave the people what they want, without complicated political messaging and boring subplots.<br /><br />My first IMDB review after 170+ ratings, just to make sure the truth is told.",0
7249,9.0,"Of all the movies I have ever seen, none have ever left me on the edge of my seat like the rise of Skywalker. At times I was so impressed, I would thrust my weight up against the chair to resist from bursting out in excitement. But of course, there were other times where I was left baffled with a million questions hyper jumping through my mind all at once. As the questions boiled on the tip of my tongue, my respect for J.J Abrams slowly piped down hill. Nonetheless, a new hope rose and fought its way through the intolerable flaws; plot holes and unanswered questions that have left me somewhat riddled. That new hope was enough to reignite my spark of respect for J.J Abrams. With all been said, I am just another thoughtful critic with a long train of opinions.",1
7250,5.0,"Just a good attemp to end the greatest story of the universal cinema, time flies seeing this movie but its a good enterteiment show and not the end that we expect",1
7251,8.0,Brings back the good old days<br /><br />And one scene reminds me of the Dunkirk,1
7252,6.0,"Ignore any 1/10 reviews, this film is incredible!<br /><br />So glad to see the humour hasn't changed through out the whole Star Wars series<br /><br />The unbelievable lack of plot holes really bought this film down to earth and the ability to keep it family friendly and suitable for all!",0
7253,9.0,End coud be better. Actually it should be difrent.,0
7254,10.0,"To be honest, when I first watched it, i did not care about the plot holes or thought anything like that and gave it a 9/10, but after watching reviews and watching the movie for the second time it really showed that This movie could have been an great one but was an wasted potential. I wish we could see Colin Trevorrow's Duel of Fates movie. To sum it up, the story felt retconned and this is also the general problem in sequels, as the only sequel i like is The Force Awakens. Both The Last Jedi and Rise of the Skywalker had let it's expectations down for me and i can blame the Productor Kathleen Kennedy for this as she made Rey overpowered(Mary Sue). As you know originally The Last Jedi's script was written by J.J Abrams but then he was replaced by Rian Johnson. And Kathleen Kennedy is the reason all this happened.",0
7255,9.0,"The movie is clearly better than its predecessor, because at least it told some story. Watching the movie i got the feeling that episode 9 tried to undo some of the decisions which were made in episode 8, but in doing so the movie got heavily overloaded. They packed so much information in episode 9 that they couldn't deliver proper explanations for them.<br /><br />I don't like their story, but I won't let that influence my rating, because I think that wouldn't be fair. But the way they told this story wasn't very well either...<br /><br />There was no preperations in the previous movies, so it all was too hasty. There were too less emotions because of it. I think at some point you don't even have to watch episode 7 and 8 to fully understand this movie.<br /><br />The worst part though is something else. I really loved the Star Wars universe. Sure, there were ups and downs, but i really enjoyed every movie of episode 1 - 6, because the movies told a bigger story with a perfect ending. It should have ended there. Instead we now learn that, the main characters of episode 1-6 gave everything for nothing.<br /><br />In my opinion it is now clear that they didn't have an idea for the whole trilogy when they started ep 7. It is now clear to me, that they wanted to do movies and didnt care about the story.<br /><br />Visuals and acting were great, so it wasn't a total bummer...<br /><br />PS: thanks to rian johnson it wasn't the worst Star Wars movie.",0
7256,6.0,"FX: B. Somewhat rushed, not as polished as one would expect. Last one was better.<br /><br />Score/Sound FX: A. Expected no less!<br /><br />Plot: E. Like the story was written using crayons on a napkin, with as much care.<br /><br />Acting: F. Fail.<br /><br />Zero character depth.<br /><br />For a trilogy/sequel of films, this has had shockly poor character development throughout.<br /><br />Most of the leads elicit as much empathy as a wet mop. Tbh, I ended up rooting for the Empire and Emo-Snowflake Vader to put me out of my misery. One shouldn't expect any less though, seeing as all the older, developed leads have been killed off (or literally died: so CGI Leia won't be counted) apart from Chewie.<br /><br />Remember our emasculated Luke Skywalker from the last SjW offering?",0
7257,5.0,The critics get it wrong AGAIN! Maybe they just don't understand Star Wars. As a lifelong fan that hated TLJ this was a great way to finish.,1
7258,3.0,"The more reviews I read and watch the more compelled I am to write one for myself. This is not a perfect movie, the pacing is rushed, they seem to be doing some backpedaling from the Last Jedi and the Leia scenes don't always work. But they did a great job with what they had to work with. The franchise is 42 years old, they had to wrap up a 9 film saga that has been decisive for the better half of 2 decades all while a main character tragically passed away before completing filming. It's not going to satisfy everyone but what movie does?",1
7259,8.0,"The movie is really amazing. It recalls past moments from the whole saga. There cannot be a better ending than this for the skywalker saga. Though there were moments that seems illogical, but still the overall story compensates for that. It really took the star wars epicness to a whole new level.",1
7260,7.0,I will not spoil the movie however I am sick and tired of people who probably haven't seen the movie saying that this movie is 1/10 score. Come on be realistic even if its such a bad movie which it isn't it can't be graded 1/10. My suggestion would be go watch the movie and enjoy the conclusion of 42 years old ride called Star Wars.,0
7261,9.0,First time I saw this I thought it wasnt that good. However now I have seen it a second time it is fantastic film.,1
7262,10.0,"The movie was a 6,5/10, really. I hated The last Jedi to death, but this is a fresh end for this bad planned trilogy. No one could have saved this trilogy, Disney tried to introduce new characters while trying to kill of old ones.",0
7263,8.0,"(my first review! it felt a bit necessary) I don't entirely understand why people are so insistent on annihilating Disney's Star Wars trilogy. Is it trendy? Is it upset 40+ year olds missing the way it used to be? I wasn't alive when the originals were released, I grew up on the prequels (which people trashed when they came out(!!)) so I reckon I can be a bit more objective about these things.",1
7264,1.0,"So glad Abrams is back!! Back to the great ,not full of plotholes, storytelling Star Wars is supposed to be!",1
7265,7.0,This film was not perfect but it had a bigger uphill battle than other star wars films.,1
7266,9.0,"I loved almost every minute of this movie, I was a fan of the previous ones as well, but this one has certainly earned its place as one of the best Star Wars movies. It lets us see some old characters, and the plot takes some interesting turns regarding the character Rey. The dilemas faced by the characters were interesting to watch, and there were some sad scenes as well. This movie additionally introduced us to some new, not seen before mechanics regarding the force. I for one didn't realise the full power of the force until I saw this movie, some of the things shown were mind blowing to me. It also helped that every scene in this move was very well designed visually. Huge credit to everyone involved! Thank you!",1
7267,8.0,"Been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid, I love every movie in its own way and this one was amazing.<br /><br />Just like the prequels the previous two were lacking abit but the last one was amazing.",1
7268,10.0,"Well the story was ok I enjoyed it. Some ? and nothing new, just an extension of the skywalker saga. We've seen things before it's a mix of everything from the star wars universe. And bringing back Palpatine feels a bit like a panic solution by Disney. I don't know what to say about that, mixed feelings.",1
7269,9.0,"As a true Saga fan, I found this addition to be the wonderful ending I had hoped it would be. I was excited to find out for sure what I had suspected about Rey since Episode VII was true. I enjoyed the epic cinematics and the acting, which didn't feel forced like Episode II and III did. Episode IX was almost perfect in every way. Thank you.",1

7273,10.0,Made up for the previous film and brought the series back in line. It is very much Ray's story. She is an incredibly character who is a very disciplined Jedi.,1
7274,10.0,"I'm completely baffled by the poor reviews. I am a bit of a fanboy of star wars and have been since I was a kid. I am an avid reader of all the star wars universe books and there has been lots of ups and downs along the way on both the films and books. This was as up as it comes.<br /><br />Loved the tone, fitted in completely with the originals. Best of the Disney films, only Rogue One came close to this one but I did enjoy 7 and 8. Had a few twists and turns and if you avoid spoilers you will get a few surprises along the way.<br /><br />Didn't cop out on the ending and go all perfect on us. Visual effects were the best of all the star wars films to date. If I had to complain, I thought the music didn't quite hit the right notes for me!<br /><br />There appears to be a narrative that Star Wars fans don't like the new Star Wars films, but this is completely against my personal experience. I watched with my wife and 11 year old daughter and all three of us were captivated. Did exactly what it should do, amaze, enthral, weep and cheer.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy. Ignore the haters who have clearly made their mind up before actually watching.<br /><br />Wanna fall asleep to a Sci Fi film, watch Ad Astra. You want to woop and cheer, watch this.",1
7275,7.0,"I'm a first time reviewer. This isn't perfect but it was an satisfying end to the Skywalker story. It has thrills, spills, tears, laughter & fear. It actually makes the last Jedi, make sense! Yes, it's not original & apart from one big reveal, it has no big twists or shocks. But it tells a good story, that isn't too confusing or convoluted. This film is faithful to star wars fans, I should know - I've been one since I first saw the original in 1977 when I was twelve! I will watch it again soon.",1
7276,10.0,"Didn't have my hopes up when I went to see it but I actually enjoyed it a lot, great action scenes and battles. At the end I was glad I went to see it",1
7277,8.0,"The end of the saga comes to an end and JJ Abrams try's his best to put it to a close. The first scene with Kylo Ren was great, and so are all of the scenes that have Adam Driver in it. The first third of the movie is slow, boring, rushed, and seemingly all over the place. The movie really picks up in the second act where we see the characters start to really shine. The ending was satisfying and full of fan service where it was appreciated. Kylo Ren steals this movie.",0
7278,9.0,Wow dont get me wrong the movie had amazing effects and all that stuff. But for the fans it was a disaster.1) Leia apparently was a jedi and in her training she won Luke. 2)the force ghosts are now catching objets and touch people ok what can I say about that I dont know. 3) Lando is just there to feel more nostalgic about the og movies. 4) Rey is a Palpatine? WHAT HOW? We dont know anything. 5)She is the most OP jedi.That it is just silly she has short training thay even couldnt complete but still she was force healing REALY? but also lightings just wow I just laughted inside the theater when I saw the scene with the speader that was pulled by the force and then the lighting. Rey is all the jedi? Rey stambs Kylo Ren with the saber and then she just heals it like it was nothing and walks away. REY KISSES KYLO REN just no please dont make it worst but they do with some super powers Kylo passes his life to the already dead Rey and he died.Did we get any explaining NO. To conclude we can clearly see that the films has action but no meaning and they became also more funny because disney wants to atract young children.So for the new kids yea ok it was a fine movie it had battles and lightsabers and pilots!!!!! WOW COOL I am gonna buy an action figure of that guy etc. For the die harf fans all that was just something rushed without meaning and worst of all without respect the previous movies and make Rey the Super Jedi which I think it is just funny because we never get to know why if they would explain I could hapilly say ok I repsect that but no they dont do anything she was a nobody and now she is a palpatine and Palpatine return they never said why or just even cared it is like a bad clickbait for the old fans to bring some guys of the previous casts and name it star wars. No this is not Star Wars it is just an action movie without meaning for the young kids without knowledge.,0
7279,8.0,Movie was predictable when I saw the opening crawl. Way to many ridiculous scenes that felt more like a comedy that takes away from the joy of Star Wars itself. Characters really had no story arcs in the series and makes you feel nothing for them. Palpatine was just thrown in due to The Last Jedi debacle and it really made no sense that he was behind it all. He feel down a shaft and exploded. Would have made more sense to have Darth Maul return instead. The final showdown was just a rehash of Return of the Jedi. By the way why isn't the Millennium Falcon destroyed with how many times it has crashed in these three movies? Wouldn't the wreckage from the Death Star destroy life on the planet? Kinda like an asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Quit with nostalgia. All Jar Jar Abrams knows how to do is copy and paste things from other stories and has no original ideas. Everything felt thrown in for convenience just to wrap it up. Disney should have given the fans what they wanted and went with material from the books from the get go. This is the kind of movie you go to just to get it over with. Kind of like an autopsy to see just how Disney and Jar Jar Abrams killed Star Wars. R.I.P original cast.,0
7280,7.0,"In an era of click-bait media and hot takes camps form. You, the reader of this, were meant to be either fiercely against The Last Jedi or fiercely in favor of it according to many media publications but what if you were somewhere between those extremes? What if you felt that some of the complaints from the most dissatisfied regarding The Last Jedi had some validity but not all of them? What if some of what interested the critics and fans of it also interested you? Then the Rise of Skywalker was made to be an absolute thrill ride for a viewer such as yourself. I know because I found myself in between the extremes before also.",1

Luckily my 10 year old son is also a fan and I promised him we would go.<br /><br />The film has improved on his predecessors, the addition of Palpatine gave it a boost and darker feel.<br /><br />But still, where the original trilogy focused on good vs bad, where does this theme remain when the 'bad guys' are such losers that even the most stupid bunch bunch of school kids could beat them. How can there ever any tension or suspense?<br /><br />Anyway, an advancement on previous films. I can only hope that the success of The Mandalorian steers Disney on the right path for future SW films. Now that the Skywalker saga is completed they can start with a clean slate.<br /><br />A new hope ...",0

7289,7.0,"The original trilogy will always be unmatched because it was such a good story, it was the ultimate story at the right time. It grew to folklore status.

My husband is not a star wars fan but he enjoyed the movie with my son. The visual effect was stunning. Some flaws like the plot hole, mediocre acting from some side actor, and the last battle need to be more epic. Overall this movie is better than the episode 8.",1

7294,5.0,"I loved the movie and this had the best opening sequence (not shot, but sequence) of any Star Wars movie! J.J. shows why he should have been in charge of all three movies and subtlety repairs the mistakes and bad taste left in our mouths form The Last Jedi. Kylo Ren is the best in this movie as the Supreme Leader and loved how strong he was. Rey can finally be appreciated as the great character she always has been in these movies after somewhat earning her place in the story after going through the most difficult hardships she's ever had to in the trilogy. She has to deal with a lot of internal struggles and challenges which gives us the best version of her we've seen as well. This movie shows us that 4 years were wasted on TLJ and we could have had soooo much better and this movie wouldn't have had to dedicate as much time course correcting.",1

This could have been so better! Also the music score during the big scènes where weak. John could have done so much better. Ending was really weak.",0

7305,9.0,"After digesting the movie now for a few days, I just appreciated it more and more. Of course, not everything that one expects, but after having thought and considered, I am very pleased. It gave me a great story, lots of thought and plot, lots of action. Pure entertainment! Just the way I want it, it fits the time it's made in, and has many good plots and reflections on the original films and does a great job for me personally. Gave me a good feeling after the movie ... and even more now! must see it again. A BIG thans for this movie... from a 70s kid who loves star wars ...and still does! This is Star Wars for me!",1

It is by far the best in the new trilogy and I suggest you go in with an open mind, especially setting aside everyone else's opinion. In doing so, I believe you will find a fulfilling experience with direction that gives nice closure to most of these characters.",1
7310,8.0,"Don't listen to the negative comments. It's really really good. Grab some popcorn and enjoy the ride for what it is. Sure you can pick holes in it if you want, but why just enjoy. If you love everything Star Wars you will love this movie.",1
7311,9.0,Massive Star Wars fan but I have to say this film ruined the force and how it works it's now just magic.,1
7312,10.0,"This is the last stars wars. The last star wars! It has to be epic! It has to have everything! The culmination of decades of love for the saga and stories all coming to an end.....we got nothing. We wanted to see our old, beloved Star Wars heroes fighting together. In the end tying all the loose strings together. Anakin finally bringing ""balance to the force"" like he was supposed to. Are we just supposed to forget about Anakin. Are the last three movies supposed to just make sense only if you through away what happened in the last six? Hate the prequels as much as you want but at least they compliment and stay true to the original saga in terms of story telling and piecing together Anakins story. The latest movies do no justice to the original films or the prequels. Anakin and Luke are supposed to be the saga's main focal points. I get there are new characters and the new generation is here to take over and be our heroes but they needed a moment-maybe when Rey was fighting Palpatine--to have all the (main) Jedi fighting beside her. Didn't Rey even say ""I am all the Jedi"". It would have made the movie and the saga complete. Have Anakin (or Darth Vader), Yoda, obi-wan, Luke, and maybe even mace windu and Qui-Jon fighting together. All the heroes fighting together as one in the end. It would tie everything together. Bring our old heroes with the new. Fighting one last epic battle. But no, they just let Rey be the face of it. This one movie shouldn't just focus on itself or the last two. It should complete the whole saga. And it didn't. That's all it needed to do. Have that one moment of past and current heroes together. That scene could have been that ""must see"" moment that fans talk about but there's none of those moments in this movie. It's really really disappointing.",0
7313,7.0,"The rot had set in from The last Jedi. I did not have high hopes for the rise of skywalker going into the cinema as there was nothing to be excited about as all the main story threads from force awakens were ruined by Rian Johnson. From the get go I knew this was going to be a different movie all together the stupid naked gun humor(last Jedi) was replaced with a darker tone an more natural comedic scenes that did not feel forced.JJ manged to somehow thread all the story lines together where the trilogy actually made sense. It was non stop action an fun ride from the get go. Sorry to all the people that are whine on here but that is what Star Wars was about. Fun kids movie. I'm longtime fan an the way I see it JJ set up interesting new story with great characters Poe finn snoke Rey mixed with the old, but my GOD Rian Johnson dropped the ball spectacularly by doing nothing with the characters HE DID not take risks, Rian story made no sense an went no where an gave us nothing to be excited bout as part of trilogy story. JJ done the best with the turd he was handed by Johnson an he done a great job of fixing the trilogy. Actually I'd watch it as part 1 an 2 force awakens then rise of skywalker it's much more enjoyable",1
7314,5.0,"I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. As many people have acknowledged, this movie seems very rushed. Almost as if the plot line was only recently sorted out. There are some scenes that create HUGE plot holes for the die hard Star Wars fans. Many visually pleasing scenes and the directors ability present the size and scale of objects is ever so pleasing. John Williams soundtrack in the movie is one again incredible. There will likely be aspects of the movie that are confusing, with little explanation, but as far as the Disney Star Wars movies go, this one is enjoyable from start to finish.",1
7315,9.0,"Firstly, it doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. However, it is very sloppy and clear that the conflicting visions between Johnson and Abrams and a lack of an over-arching, point A to C plan was never put in place. Lack of consistency with vision from the directors are to blame for the main issues in this movie; JJ essentially tried to fix TLJ, put his own Episode 8 in and round off the saga, which was a terrible idea and approach to take. People blaming Disney for this trilogy may have a point when it comes to creating it in the first place, but Disney are not to blame for the writing and directing of these films so it is pointless to do so. Just because it's Star Wars doesn't mean it can't be a bad film; that's not Disney's fault.",0

It was not as much of a disappointment as I thought it would be is all I can really say about it. The music and SoundFX really draws you into the film and makes you feel like you are with the characters throughout their journey. The visuals are also well done throughout the movie, but other than the visuals and sounds the movie is not great.<br /><br />The acting by Adam Driver is the only actor who did very well. Daisy, John, and Carrie do a good job of their characters but nothing amazing. The writing on some of the lines were horrible and often poorly delivered by the cast.<br /><br />The whole plot of the movie just doesn't make sense and it doesn't add anything new to the series. Nothing new at all. I so wish that they would have had a long sit down and actually come up with something new for the series instead of give the director creative liberties and make this mess. This movie is so upsetting that I actually made this IMDb account so I could write a review about this so called movie.<br /><br />Watch it if you must but you are better off staying home and re-watching Episodes 1-3 because they make way more sense than this hot mess.",0

7332,1.0,Great movie don't listen to the nay sayers there are always plenty of people with negative reviews. Kind of tells you about their personalities. Always negative never positive.,1
7333,8.0,"First I like to point out that I am a fan of the Star Wars enterprise. The visual effects are of the scale with every new episode that came out the last couple of years. However that being said Its my opinion that the soul and heart of the whole franchise has last its touch. Call it nostalgia but nowadays its like a ""Dada"" thing for scriptwriters to end a seemingly good movie with a a-typical ending. I call this new phenomena "" a game of thrones ending "". You read the books you follow the movies and in doing so you automatically feel which endings are going to do the storyline good. Did ""The Rise of Skywalker"" disappoint? Not entirely. It has all the ingredients it needs and even if it was rated 4 I would still go see it in the movie theater. So why didn't I like the ending? Well unless I missed the entire ""Ménage à Trois"" thing I do not understand why Kylo Ren is evaporating at the end just after the movie finally reveals that Rey has strong feelings for him. Where does the character of Finn suddenly fit into all of this? Obviously he is madly in love with Rey but that's about all that there is to it. No real interaction between him and Rey in that area. So finally its about Ben And Rey or the ying and yang of the Force. What greater ending for the Star Wars saga could it have been if the scriptwriters would have put in a little bit more ""Romeo and Juliet"" in that storyline and topped it off with a happy ending for a change meaning Ren and Rey lived happily ever after being parents of little Skywalker's and finn maybe being their godparent together with Jannah because those 2 seem to be getting off of real good at the end they would have been destined to fall in love had this been the previous and not the last star wars movie. I will rate this 7 despite some serious plot holes but it could have been so much better. Let this be a shout out to other movie makers. The world is a pretty ""crappy"" place already and at least in the movies for just a brief moment I like to think that their can also be a happy ending to life. After the movies credits I can always snap back to reality.",1
7334,10.0,"I couldn't have been more pleased with this movie! I will admit that Episodes 7 and 8 left me a little disappointed (I still like them for the adventure but they didn't wrap in the story line for me). Episode 9 did exactly that, weaving the whole story together (and absolutely redeeming Luke from Episode 8) and leaving everything perfectly. Great job!!",1
7335,7.0,I went to watch the movie with small hope of a correction to the damage TLJ has caused to the franchise. I was positively surprised to the extend JJ managed to fill up the holes of the TLJ. Never expected the ROS to be so good. JJ saved the franchise. I believe its by far the best one of the 3 last movies. It's the first (on the new trilogy) with a proper original story and a decent ending.,1
7336,10.0,I am confused by all these mediocre and negative reviews I am encountering here. It may be possible that many people have been influenced by their experiences with the other two new films which really weren't that good. Especially Episode 8 was an absolute mess in my opinion.,0
7337,8.0,"Oookay, I give you credit JJ for answering literally every question we had plus fixing what Rian Johnson did in the last jedi. I love that Rey is a Palpatine because it (kind of) explains why shes so damn powerful. But I just cannot get behind the emperor returning. It completely ruins anikans sacrifice and character.

If movies are only to throw the visual animations with latest tricks, maybe they succeeded, but the movie and the story was just a shame and horrible to watch. Looks like the story was written by some group of children with no clue how to create a good running story with enough adventure, action and storyline that would give you the impression of certain surprises.<br /><br />Some of the scenes where just shamefull, horses running on top of the star destroyer, all dead charachters from the past resurrected suddenly, all those ""Jedi"" force gone beyond originality like teleporting stuff from the other side of the galaxy etc. That is just ridicilous and shows that writers had no imagination, they just throw in carbage putting viewers to a state of morons with no brains.<br /><br />I could immediately cut out dozen of scenes and plot decisions which would make movie more simple, more natural what the original Star Wars stood for, carefully placed story pieces and atmosphere, first three Star Wars still are the best movies from this series. This lates was just a typical Hollywood crap with too much of special effects and unrelated and predictable scenes. Charachters were hollow and out of context, scenes flowing random here and there.

Now I feel like a lot of the hate comes from people who hated the Last Jedi, and maybe even those who hated the Force Awakens. But if you're a long time Star Wars fan you will like or love this movie. It does so much fan service it's incredible, and I'm not going to act like this movie doesn't have flaws. Because it does but I feel the people who talk bad about this movie only fixate on the bad and say nothing about the good. The characters introduced in this movie don't have a complete character arc and the movie feels a bit rushed at time. But I feel that's because Rian J. didn't understand the direction J. J. wanted to take the movies. So everything J. J. wanted had to be told quickly in 2hrs and 30mins.

Only having 2 hours 22 mins to get the story line back on track and build up a film worth of lost character development and dead storyline from the monstrosity of The Last Jedi. Plus has to bring this saga to an epic conclusion. He did good. The film runs at break neck speed to try and accommodate basically two films in one but he does bring back the like ability of the characters he created in The Force Awakens and that taste of what Star Wars should be, funny, adventurous and most importantly madly unrealistic. People kick off toooo much. Star Wars is unrealistic! with mad plot holes and convenient strokes of luck or chance but that made me love the originals. It is a fun adventure and this film does claw back abit of that warm feeling The Force Awakens gave us. Worth a watch there's a squashed feel to it but there's some amazing scenes that hit even the most uptight Star Wars fans.",1

7353,6.0,"The best thing about this movie was Kylo/Rey connection, and their struggle to pick a side. I couldn't help but wonder while in the cinema: why the bloated, rushed plot? Couldn't they have made Kylo the main villain, started the movie by showing that he has only lost to Rey before because he was still torn between light/dark side and was holding back? Establish him as a real threat by making him defeat Rey and almost kill her in the beginning. Then the plot will be about the resistance trying to stop Kylo and kill him, while Rey, being trained by Luke and Anakin force ghosts, is torn between giving up on him and trying to save him, because she feels she owe Han and Leia. This could have given plenty of time for us to connect with Kylo and Rey, and plenty of time for them to form a sort of a bond. I see a wasted opportunity to make a character-driven movie that focused on the struggle of characters and their connections to each other. They chose to go down the route of a thousand spaceships firing at each other, was lame for me. Anyway, no, wasn't a bad movie, was an average one with some rare good moments.",0

And Alot of people are saying that Disney ruined the Sequel Trilogy. But I can't agree with it. I got to watch Conclusion Star Wars movie in theaters like my Mom did back in 1983. That is beyond special to me. I remember seeing Revenge of the Sith with her and my family in 2005 feeling like it was the last time we could experince Star Wars the way it was meant to be watched. Not under the heaviest of microscopes but with Awe and Wonderment like we did when we were younger.<br /><br />I saw the film and there might be somethings that were rushed given. But no matter what, It was A Star Wars Movie. And It didn't ruin my life.",0
7361,10.0,"A contension develops in this franchise that first began with ""Solo"" and now with this movie. The writers and producers have added a scene of same sex couple kissing.

It adds nothing to the storyline and if that is the case, it has no business in the movie.",0
7362,9.0,"Now first off I want to start off by the one review I just saw a snippet of saying you should disregard reviewers rating the movie 1/10 or 10/10, I got news for you there are people who actually got an open mind and know how to approach movies in the proper way. Or possibly that maybe slipped your mind, never tell anyone to avoid reading those types of ratings because there are some people who genuinely rate with open honesty.<br /><br />Now I understand you can't believe all because all they are doing is blowing hot air, but to rate movies and genuinely understand the business you have to not set expectations so high and also another thing that irks me the most is people a lot of times just write these to complain how about open mindedness here movies can't please everyone so quit your whining about it.<br /><br />Other than that you want to know my reason for my rating? The evolution of characters, an extremely moving story, and the return of memorable characters that is what made this film really stand out from the rest.<br /><br />So if you want to complain Disney and Abrams screwed it up or it was too long and didn't make sense then you really need to reevaluate how you approach not only watching films but also how you rate them on the scale.<br /><br />In conclusion, the three reasons I gave and not only did I find it enjoyable, the reasons I give The Rise of Skywalker the proper due it deserves a 10/10.",1

7377,1.0,I seriously don't get all the negative opinions. Ep 9 had some really great moments and scenes and very few really bad ones. The music was great (unlike ep 8) and Babu Frik was genious.

7378,1.0,"Unlike some other posters if you KNOW Star Wars this is a good one. So tired of armchair directors/writers whining when they dont get what they think should happen. Some of the reviews here describe inaccurate or false scenes, maybe they drank too much and were in the restroom a lot. One said you never saw Leia with a saber-false! Go see it for yourself with an open mind and not someone else's negative thoughts.",0
7379,10.0,"This is an old (not so old) fan speaking. I'm glad this trilogy had an end this strong. I mean, don't get me wrong but, it was a nice ride throught the previous two films, but the final chapter paid off for waiting so long (almost 5 years). I noticed a wave of bad reviewers wrecked the ROS, but honestly guys, what did you expect? I'm glad J.J Abrams saved the trilogy in such a prominent way. Star Wars is very well kept for the time being, but I have to admit that it really concerns me the exposure and the amount of ""width"" the franchise is taking. Maybe we will have more in the future... maybe not. But who knows? Enjoy and don't overreact! It's Star Wars!",1

7382,8.0,"I have no idea why anybody is moaning about this movie. It is fun, dark, sad, lovely and satisfying. As an adult fan of the series, there were a few moments that I wish they had held to some bold writing, but I was happy leaving the theater. I did not feel the same way leaving TLJ. This movie, Rogue One and The Mandalorian are the sparks that are the hope for the future of Star Wars story telling. I am once again hopeful and looking forward to more stories from the Star Wars universe.",1
7383,6.0,"It's like riding a Rollercoaster and being bombarded by mystery boxes. The third entry in a series such as this should answer questions made in the first two entries. Instead, you're bombarded by more mysteries and ""WHAT"" so fast you can't even process what you are watching.",0
7384,8.0,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is not the best movie, we can all agree on that. But it was great. The character development was way better, than I expected, and the story was good, although it sucked at some points. The twist, and the secrets revealed were surprising, but the way they told them wasn' the best. The ending was totally different than what I was expecting, but it was still awesome. The Rise of Skywalker is the proper ending this saga deserves.",1
7385,1.0,"A lot of things that are either ""too powerful"", ""too lucky"" or ""too surprising"" going on all the time. It's simply not reasonable. Contradicts the nature of the universe and the previous storyline. It's like they're trying to create a Marvel-copycat.",1

Subsequent movies largely followed that vision.<br /><br />I went in without expectations, and left with a feeling of completion of the story, to believe there should be a different ending, or to expect a different ending, is to not comprehend the full story of the movies themselves, I would say George lucas would be proud of the people who bought to an end a great conclusion to his vision, and as they say, all great things must end.....",1

7397,7.0,"When you look back on this trilogy, it is clear Disney made a clear error in not having JJ Abrams direct the whole trilogy. It is clear JJ is a true fan of Star Wars as both TFA and TRoS largely have the tone, look, and character approach of the original trilogy. It is also clear that he recognised TLJ was a misstep veering too far from the approach, mythology and tone of the original trilogy such that he scrambled to fix so many of those problems Rian Johnson crested. Hey, of course Rey is somebody - let's use Palpatine (even though there is nothing pointing to his return in the first two movies). Where were the Knights of Rdn in TLJ? Oh, here they are - they've been there all along of course! Rey didn't receive enough Jedi training to be so powerful in TLJ - hey, we'll add the training retrospectively in this movie ! Finn romance in the TLJ - of course that was unbelievable! So let's go back to him sort of liking Rey and hey here's another option with the other ex-stormtrooper! Luke the weak sourpuss in TLJ - of course he was wrong to be portrayed this way so we'll remake him to be the selfless, heroic and optimistic character he was in the whole original trilogy! No back story at all on Snope? No problem - it was Palpatine who created Snope (literally grew or bred/cloned him or many of him it looked like I believe?!)",0

The whole next day i wanted to go back to the cinema and watch the movie again.<br /><br />Now and give a 10/10 to give the movie a higher grade, because it doesnt deserve a 6.9",0
7399,7.0,I guess everyone thinks they could do better in making a star wars film. I thought everything about it was great. The way they answered questions and tied everything together. I remember everyone hated the prequels too and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Just more tribalism with internet losers who feel like they're in the club if they hate on things. Really a good movie go see it.,1

7402,8.0,"From a chat...<br /><br />they did not ruin anything! see the movie 5 times! there are symbols and a hidden message within the film! it is all about this message and the film's action is like a satellite around it, which could not have been built better for the message to be delivered. of course there are some tweaks here and there that were required(i did not like: the 2 falcons mirrored in the light speed dance, Rey lack of flow in the landing from her training session, lack of come down on the other side of the wave when she was the skipper , as if we do not have to rush to see what.s on the other side; nice allegory though; the fact that the scenes were pictured too fast, from too close or too far distance, and was not too pleased for the eyes, but maybe it is my only point of view; some scenes were forced/ unnatural- kiss , Ben - Solo talk, the spy revealed scene, Ben 's death; nice idea with emperor 's lightning: for a moment it took me to a different direction, which was nice- i thought of Shakespeare and that they will all die that moment lol; nice Shakespearean end but Ben could have fallen differently. I enjoyed the most the scene when they are on the field and the huge waves behind, maybe because it looked similar to the place where I live. Palpatine was awesome: i think he played for the whole team: his attitude and his well chosen words transformed his role into something Extraterrestrial; he was phenomenal. I also have nice words for the other actors and the whole crew there. I would have given 10 but , gave it only 9 because of the fast , too close and too far filming , not seeing too much of the surrounding like in Rogue One for example.) but as a whole , the film was well built and same as the dagger helped Rey to get to that clue reaching her next goal, the same , the film itself points out clues within itself to get to that secret message to be delivered for those who have eyes to see; i think that is what art does - it delivers a message , and everybody sees it the way they want, and that is the beauty of it.",1

7410,8.0,"Whats up with this 1/10s? No. This was very entertaining and awesome. Ok, I agree there were a few little details I would polish, but overall it was amazing. It's the Skywalker story, off course it was amazing. Stop with the negative coments and negative ratings, they're absurd!",1
7411,8.0,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker certainly has its issues. The film's pacing for instance is way more quick than I would have hoped. There isn't really that much room to breath in this film. This is pretty much the only Star Wars film I would want an extended cut for. Other issues I had would go into spoiler territory.<br /><br />However, on almost every other front, this film delivers. The characters still have amazing chemistry. The score by John Williams is masterful as always. The cinematography is great; this is just a gorgeous film to look at.<br /><br />While I do understand that some may not like the progression of events, I found myself greatly entertained and invested by The Rise of Skywalker and I'm certainly looking forward to seeing it again.",1

7414,2.0,"I found this to be a good film.<br /><br />We should remember when watching this film, how many people were involved and how much effort they put in to bring us a SW film.

7417,9.0,The Rise of Skywalker is just ok. There are things to hate or dislike. AND there are some speeches that may evoke emotion from the viewer. I do think J.J. Abrams saved the franchise. The Last Jedi crapped all over Star Wars and it's fans. The ROS was somewhat acceptable. I still dislike the prequels and this newest Rey trilogy. AND enough was added to A New Hope to blemish it. But I digress...The Rise of Skywalker is worth seeing if you have come this far. The Saga is ended. P.S. Han shot 1st,1

Disconnected from the heroes i really couldn't find myself rooting for any of them and it's definitely not the fault of the actors.

Yes, it has nostalgia but at a just level. And the plot is as good as in the original saga, with twist and humor as in the originals. What do you expect? The bad guys Winning?

7430,9.0,"I grew up with the uncut original trilogy on VHS. Saw the prequels when they came out and I was a boy, Loved TFA and even liked TLJ. But this, predictable, unoriginal, crammed into what should have been 2 movies for what it was. Palpatine comes back. No, not as a clone, that was Snoke. Rey is his granddaughter. Yup Palpatine had a son, who was he? What happened to him? Why was he never mentioned? Snoke was a clone. Cool I can get behind that, so why isn't this emperor a clone? Who the hell are the Knights of Ren? Glad they're act in this movie but no answers. What happened to the padawans Ben took when he destroyed Luke's temple? Why did Rey claim the name Skywalker and not let it die with all of the old empire? Palpatine can force lightning an entire fleet now that he was brought back from the dead? Kylo turns back to the light and dies. That's fine I can get behind that because we all saw it coming 5 years ago. What is Zori and Poes back story? Rey buries Leia and Luke's/Analins lightsabers (yeah I know they destroyed Luke's/Anakin's in the last film but just ignore it) so why did she build her own? That should have signifiied the end of the Jedi and the Sith and there should be peace in the Galaxy. Finn is Force sensitive apparently, but let's not explore it. The Death Star crashed on Endor they say yet the planet looks nothing like Endor. A lot of unanswered questions. The film was exciting, it looked great but left too many unanswered questions to be the final film. If this were spread out it would have an opportunity to get a 10 from me.

This movie had to move the story forward (which EP 8 didn't) and wrap it up. It accomplished that and works as a star wars movie. It had action, it was funny and had sad moments. The only thing that I wish they had done is to have all the jedi force ghosts show up at the end. It's a small nitpick but the rest was good.",0

No. But it gives a good conclusion to the trilogy. Ben solo has the best arc out of anyone and is by far the best character in the trilogy. This movie shows that as well. The only problems I have is the name of the movie is misleading, and the beginning went by really fast. First thirty minutes was choppy but that's understandable because J.J. is trying to make up for the last Jedi. It's a good movie and every Star Wars fan would enjoy it.

7442,9.0,"Going into this third and final film of the Disney era Skywalker sequel saga, I wasn't very optimistic and thought that this will surly be a letdown. I was pleasantly incorrect. The film was a delight, it exceeded my expectations without a doubt. Does it have nostalgia kickers? Yes it does, but that isn't a bad thing, especially for a film wrapping up a 40+ year story. There were answers and nods to events from The Last Jedi that wrapped up some questions, though it may have been in a blink and you miss it kind of format. All-in-all it felt fairly solid. The action was fast paced and the story moved in a way that kept you in your seat. It makes sense as to how others might feel that it was a convoluted story, but if you keep your eyes glued to the screen, and have watched the other films while also having a decent knowledge of Star Wars lore (not required but helps), then this film will not be hard to follow. It's fast enough to keep it from getting stale or boring which is great. I highly recommend this film for lovers and hardcore fans of Star Wars. The Force is with this one.",1
7443,8.0,"After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I had little to no hope from The Rise of Skywalker. Still I became a little optimistic knowing JJ was going to direct it. It is very clear that Disney had no idea from the get go that what they are actually going for. JJ and Rian both had different visions and it shows.<br /><br />There are so many WTF questions in this movie that I stopped thinking about ""how and why this just happened"" in the middle.<br /><br />To correct the mistakes that the last Jedi made, JJ have made some questionable choices and very few of them have paid off.<br /><br />The plot holes in this movie are so big that you could fit an entire star killer base through them. How can a master planer like Palpatine, who is plotting for 70 years suddenly does things off the cuff. There are so many things that don't make sense. There are some editing mistakes too.<br /><br />Now to the good stuff:<br /><br />Adam Driver's Kylo Ren really shines in this movie. He has given a brilliant performance. Even though Carrie Fisher is dead, they have done a good job showing her on screen using previously unused footage. Cinematography is spectacular, as expected form JJ backed by equally spectacular John Williams score. Some of the lightsaber battles and force ""miracles"" look so freaking awesome that I unknowingly let out a loud cheer. Speaking of new force powers, I would recommend you watch 7th episode of The Mandalorian to get a better sense of it all. There are so many scenes and callbacks and easter eggs deliberately added just for fanservice and it works. Lets just say everything from canon can be found if you look closely enough.

I had no idea what to expect and I was surprised how much this movie tugged at my emotions. You might have a completely different reaction. Fair enough.

I loved so many scenes in this movie. It has a lot of heart and the scenery is beautiful. The action and effects are incredibly well done but it is the character moments for me that really work. Unfortunately because of the pace at which some of this is introduced you may need more than one viewing to really soak it in. A big shout out to what Daisy and Adam have done with their roles and to Abrams and Johnson for the interesting way they brought them together through the force.

If you haven't read any of the Star Wars comics or books, it would be a good idea to research them after watching the movie to gain insight as to how Palpatine came back. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. And for those of you who don't understand how Ben brought Rey back to life, never underestimate the power of the combined dark and light sides of the force. Further into that vein, Ben became one with the force, just as Obi-Wan and Yoda did in previous movies.

Spoilers:<br /><br />I hated the fact that the title is Rise of Skywalker but almost nothing impactful was made by a Skywalker in the whole film...... This was about Rey. I cared more about Ben than Rey i wanted to see that a skywalker finishes the job and kills palpatine alone or with help of Rey. Or atleast the ghost of Anakin helps out Rey to finish Palpatine of but no we only get some voices...<br /><br />I gave it a 7 bc i teared up 3 or 4 times but i was expecting to Anakin the chosen one to show up and somehow make an inpact.

7451,10.0,"The Rise of Skywalker begins by invalidating the first 6 movies. In the opening crawl the emperor is said to be alive without any explanation as to how he survived episode 6. This completely negates the entire point of Anakin being the chosen one and the sacrifice he made to save his son and bring ""balance"" to the force. The beginning of the movie was very poorly paced as it hops quickly from planet to planet without allowing the viewer to even enjoy the planet while also trying to set up some semblance of a coherent plot for the rest of the movie. Overall, the whole movie felt very rushed. The plot was very bland and unoriginal as half of it was, ""hey we need to find this object, to lead us to this other object ,to find this place"". Most of the characters introduced were throwaway characters who were extremely forgettable and were only there as plot devices to move the protagonists to the next point in the movie. The knights of Ren were laughable as all they did was walk around looking cool before getting absolutely demolished.<br /><br />The humor in the movie was very hit and miss and seemed very forced for the most part.<br /><br />The visuals were stunning as they have been for all of sequel trilogy movies but the lack of any good story really took away from the awe and wonder of it all. It felt like talking to a pretty girl (or guy) with no personality. Eye candy, but that's it.<br /><br />The Force in The Rise of Skywalker has become insanely overpowered in comparison with other movies without much explaining except a short training montage from Rey. The movie continually introduces new force powers without much explanation that conveniently allow the heroes to succeed in whatever they are doing.<br /><br />The worst part of the whole movie for me was that none of the characters actions really had any consequences. Whenever they were in a tough situation or something bad happened the movie reversed the consequences. Any sacrifice or failure a character made had no weight to it as it would be undone 5 minutes later.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality was the actors performances, Adam Driver does an amazing job as Kylo Ren yet again and Daisy Ridley did a fantastic job of portraying her struggle of finding her identity.<br /><br />Overall the movie was a jumbled, hurried mess. It was glaringly obvious that there was no overall plan for this trilogy which resulted in this disaster of a story. If you turn off your brain and don't think about logic or good storytelling you might be able to at least enjoy the visuals and the fact that it is a Star Wars movie.",0

7453,4.0,"In my humble opinion, ""The Force Awakening"" is the best movie in this new trilogy. The others have some flaws, but I can say that, between episodes 8 and 9, I left the theater more satisfied after seeing The Rise of Skywalker. The main reason is that I liked the way Rey, Poe and Finn were developed in this last one compared to The Last Jedi. The film pays tribute to the original trilogy, and that was great, and still answers some fans' wishes, which guarantees some more points for the feature film.",1

7463,9.0,"Star Wars represents different things to different people. It's the brands strength, and glaring weakness. Critics and a lot of fans seem to be maligning this movie, because it didn't line up with their personal expectations. The ability in our time to get exactly what you want, when you want it, is IMHO making everyone into a higher critic these days. The bottom line is no one is happy with a plain cup of coffee anymore, they want a ""triple grande decaf two pump soy latte with no whip"" "" oh I didnt get my third pump"" ""I think this is almond milk"" "" this movie wasn't new enough"" ""Rey is too perfect"" blah blah blah. New is not always good (see Episodes I and II) being content with things IS always good. Star Wars- A New Hope was not new. It borrowed from countless things, and put them in a new package. Despite what people say, TLJ was not that groundbreaking, or new either. If you want new, watch a new movie franchise. If we don't hold that movie to a standard of what's new, why do we have to hold this one to it. That being said, THERE IS A LOT OF NEW IN THIS MOVIE. I have consumed a lot of Star Wars, (books, movies, tv shows, games) There is a lot of new, a lot of old, a lot of good, and a lot of bad. What some people like, others seem to hate. I go in with low expectations, (It will probably be closer to Episode I than KOTOR) and see how I feel at the end of the movie. I left ""The Last Jedi"" feeling flat, and disappointed. Because I did not give into visceral hate for it, I have come to appreciate it more. This one made me feel a lot of things. If Episode IV and V are the standards to judge all Star Wars against, which I think personally is the case, this one holds up to me. It was fun, the humor was right, which is something the last one got wrong to me. The stakes were high, the emotions were raw, I left feeling great. See it for yourself, and it may line up with what you want, but don't expect perfection, and be open. And please, don't hate someone because they enjoy their coffee a certain way.",1

7471,7.0,"This movie somehow gets better and worse every time I watch it. It has plenty of great parts to it. The Jedi talking to Rey, while not making too much canonical sense, was absolutely the most epic part of this movie. Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is still a fantastic, deep and compelling character. And the acting is pretty great 95% of the time. The actors all did the best with what they were given. Every time I watch it, I come away thinking, ""well, it wasn't really as bad as I remember. There are plenty of things bringing it up from being awful.""",1
7472,10.0,Reading the reviews you could go into that movie expecting to see a film that is the deformed child born from The force awakens and the last Jedi but surprisingly it's not. An honest review would go a long the lines of the movie starts off quite shaky throwing you staright into the action with some sketchy effects and camera work but after the first 20 minutes the movie finds its feet and takes you on a very easy to follow story that in my opinion does enough to make you like star wars again after the train wreck that was the last Jedi. I recommend to anyone that hasn't watched the film yet to be more open minded going into the film and you might just find yourself enjoying starwars again.,1
7473,3.0,"It's an ENTERTAINING MOVIE - it's a GOOD STAR WARS MOVIE - It's a SOLID SKYWALKER SAGA MOVIE - It's the BEST POSSIBLE, given the circumstances, FINALISATION of DISNEY's STAR WARS TRILOGY - It's a PROBLEMATIC CONCLUSION of THE CENTRAL STAR WARS SAGA OF 9 MOVIES - It's TOO OVERLOADED WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS that should have been DISTRIBUTED MORE EVENLY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DISNEY's TRILOGY. And YES, it is FULL OF SMALLER and BIGGER WINKS, NODS, HOMMAGES and TRIBUTES to Lucas' ORIGINAL SAGA and PREQUELS, but these elements and scenes are incorporated rather logically and rationally, so I would not, with all the respect to some reviewers, call it fan-service for the sake of fan-service or s comfort cinema food for STAR WARS hardcore fanbase.<br /><br />Okay, let us start with a statement that the biggest problems of the Rise of Skywalker are stemming from the fact, judging by the entire trilogy, there a tangible ABSENCE OF ONE COHERENT CREATIVE VISION underlying all three movies. In sum, Disney could hire different directors and scriptwriters to execute such project - there is no problem with such studio-system way of producing films, but there should have been ONE PERSON IN CHARGE OF THE PROJECT with ONE CLEAR IDEA ABOUT THE TRILOGY. Abrams, Johnson or somebody else, it matters not, but there should be ONE DEFINITVE CREATOR. Clearly, as shocking as it may be, there was no such thing at the beginning, and given that the movies had been executed by two almost contradicting voices in terms of the approach to the source material and film-making in general, it is then no surprise that Disney's trilogy and its conclusion does not hold together particularly well. Firstly, part of the problem lies in the fact that Disney wanted to do basically remakes of the original trilogy updated for 21st century audience as a safe bet in terms of economics and etc. However, Disney understandably did not want to confess this to STAR WARS fans looking for the continuation of the original trilogy, and therefore they somehow try to make a VARIATION ON THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY with SAME BACKBONE FOR THE STORY with new young generation of characters, while using reducing the old and iconic ones as a supporting cast to be killed throughout the trilogy, so they could be, in terms of movies, discarded forever, giving space to Disney's new generation of heroes. Okay, it does make sense and there is nothing wrong with such approach, but Disney did not play it fair with fans, explaining their new trilogy in these terms. Rather, Disney intentionally let people believe that they are making a genuine continuation and culmination of the Skywalker Saga. It's sad because some fans have been disappointed, and the Rise of Skywalker can be hardly perceived as something more than a variation on the Return of the Jedi. In terms of the Skywalker saga, Disney's trilogy does not deepen, extend or elaborate on previous 6 episodes of Skywalker saga, it rather frames the saga in the Rise of Skywalker. It's a shame because the Force Awakens was a promising start and, at the time, I truly believed that the connection of Disney and STAR WARS was capable of producing films of similar qualities like LOTR series, aspiring to snatch several Oscars for my beloved space opera.<br /><br />Nonetheless, as I suggested before, the Rise of Skywalker is a good STAR WARS movie, a good episode in Skywalker Saga and a good movie in general. The pivotal problem, however, is that much of its screen-time, the Rise of Skywalker is busy navigating the story back to the far far away galaxy of STAR WARS, so to speak. Let's face it - The Last Jedi was a very good movie and very good space-opera movie, but not a good STAR WARS movie and utterly bad and nonsensical movie in Skywalker Saga. Undoubtedly, Rian Johnson is a very good film-maker, but he was a right choice for the Last Jedi, which, does not mean that he was a wrong choice for STAR WARS franchise in general. But should have been tasked with doing something brand new within STAR WARS, perhaps a new trilogy from distant past with all his talent for twists, surprises and deconstructions. To put it differently, the screen-time of the Last Jedi largely used to show, do and solve things to venture into unexplored areas, while it should have been building bridges from the Force Awakens and extending its motifs to connect it smoothly with the Rise of Skywalker. Basically, trilogies does not work on the basis of thesis-antithesis-antithesis to previous antithesis, and the Empire Strikes Back or, say LOTR: Two Towers were not antitheses of their respective predecessors, buy they rather served as great second acts - thickening up both the story and world-building, preparing us for the ultimate ordeal and conclusion in third episode. So, if the second act does not play this role within the trilogy, you can hardly expect the Rise of Skywalker to do miracles, when, in fact, has to deal with largely missing second act, and is thus forced to use its precious screen-time to build ad hoc bridges, when, in fact, these bridges should have been constructed by the Last Jedi - and this has nothing to do with quality of the Last Jedi as a film in general sense. All in all, the Rise of Skywalker suffers, when it really suffers, from the failed function of the Last Jedi as a part of a trilogy - that is - being useful as a second act.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />",0

There were much fewer plot holes than the last film and you get to see the return of some old characters we haven't seen in a while.

7484,10.0,"I'm a Star Wars fan, simple. The magic of the original trilogy thrilled me as a child in the eighties. Every iconic scene and character will stay with me forever. The reason the first trilogy worked is because it had drama, originality, humour, great actors and actresses and competent direction. The set pieces worked, they excited me. Back in the late nineties when phantom menance was released I was genuinely excited to be back at the cinema and back in this world. New Jedi, seeing more of their powers in action, even jar jar was a digital experiment that, while not great, worked at the time. Attack of the clones and revenge of the sixth completed a good story arc, again filled with memorable set pieces and scenes, good actors. These last three films, and rise in particular have had almost nothing of what made Star Wars great. No originality. Rise for example has a scene so like pod racing from phantom menace it was embarrassing. We have seen these planets before, yeah give a little fan service nod to other places and character, but keep it subtle. The ending of this film includes a massive battle to end all space battles, thousands of ships both good and bad - it should have been incredible, should being the key word. It flopped, it was boring! How the people that made this film have managed to make a thousand space ship battle boring is honestly quite impressive!<br /><br />To say I'm disappointed is an understatement, to have this as the final film is heartbreaking. No care for the characters, no care for a coherent story, respectful of what has come before, no originality, no drama, passion or love. Throw in some old characters, planets and scenes we have had before, send it to the cinemas and make a billion. A win for Disney, a loss for fans.",0

The only part I genially didn't like is what kept the story moving forward early on which is that need to find that pyramid shaped device (which gave me flashbacks to that really dumb map to Luke Skywalker).The pacing early on was rushed but it didn't bother me (probably because I was expecting it) and I'm sure on subsequent viewings it will feel completely normal. What I think really worked in the end was the characters and in particular the relationship between Rey & Kylo Ren and bring back the Emperor actually made sense and the sense that the ending wouldn't have worked as well as it did without him. I the film address a lot of issue that people had with the Last Jedi. My recommendation is to go see it, stick with it to the end and don't let nit picks get in the way and if you are going to nit pick this film please also use the same level of nit pickery on Return of the Jedi a genially far less satisfy conclusion to a Star Wars trilogy (yes I went there).",0

In theory, Star Wars end when Darth Vader dies. The saga was never about fights between the good and bad side, the Jedis and the Siths, it was supposed to be about Darth Vader and Anakin's life, about friendship, and family problems, George Lucas already said this.

Don't get me wrong, I love some action sequences! I love light saber fights. The more, the merrier. But this film lacks any real depth or substance. There is essential zero character development except for one main exception. It's like a two hour action sequence with no real order or sense among the madness. No cohesiveness. No sound explanations. No logic. No back story for the newbies just revival of the old. This entire film seems like an effort to repair damage and to appease fans following Rian Johnson's eccentric Episode VII. There are cheap fixes to every problem and some miracle solution beyond comprehension. There are way too many Easter eggs. The whole movie feels like an Easter egg. It's like a Hail Mary attempt to end a series that deserved so much better. We have lived and died with these characters for 40 years. Looking at the three films as a whole, it's obvious there was never a roadmap heading into Episodes 6, 7, 8 and it feels like JJ Abrams was making up new material on the go. He defied all rules and logic to tie up this epic story in a nicely wrapped package. This is entertaining, yes. It's just not great. Not even close. Nothing compared to the Star Wars greatness of the past.",0
7517,6.0,"Contrived bookend to the Sequel Trilogy. You can tell this was produced hastily and to messily tie up the events of the ST. After seeing this film, I wanted more, but not in a good way.<br /><br />On the plus side, C3PO was great. Sith Troopers were great but got almost no screentime. Luke had some great moments. And the fact that they presented a characterization of Leia using only archive footage is simply incredible.<br /><br />6.5/10",1
7518,3.0,There are at least 8 minutes of good scenes during the 2 hours and 22 mins runtime of this movie.,0
7519,6.0,"What do all the people want that give the last 3 movies crap ratings?? Episodes 4,5 and 6 were fantastic, I think the last 3 were good and geared more towards our children. I took my 2 kids today and they absolutely loved it along with the force awakens and the last jedi. So the 'Star Wars' experts please leave the crap comments to yourselves......",1
7520,5.0,A big Star Wars fan since I was a child and really enjoyed the feelings of nostalgia. A film sure to please any Star Wars fan you would think. Cannot understand some of the reviews slating it just take it for what it is a fantasy thriller!,1
7521,9.0,Worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Period.,0
7522,9.0,"The people writing the 1 star reviews have been waiting for this and WANTED to give this a bad score since the last jedi... Personally, TROS felt a little bit rushed at times, but was overall a fun adventure and fitting end to the saga. Chewies reaction to Leias death broke my heart in two...... Ben solo with the blue saber against the knights of ren was AMAZING! Go watch the movie and judge for yourself before you go and give it a 1 star review, because it definitely deserves better than that! 8/10",1
7523,1.0,"This is a great final installment in the Star Wars ""Skywalker"" movies. To all those who think it's too complicated, it falls on its face, it's made only for money or toys because DISNEY, it's just stupid and cheesy, or it's just BAD, I do not, I repeat, DO NOT see what they mean. This is a movie series about space battles and ninja laser sword people that actually has a following on global scale. All these nerds sweating too much because Star Wars isn't how they wanted it to be gotta calm the down. Let me give you some examples of why I rated this 9/10",0
7524,9.0,Saw it today and thought it was all over the place. Seemed like they tried to cram in as much as possible but sometimes a pizza with the lot is a sloppy mess.,0
7525,9.0,"After ""The Last Jedi"" by Rian Johnson, Disney brought back J.J. Abrams to try and correct the poor decisions made by Rian that split Star Wars fans apart like Moses did with the waters of the Red Sea! Majority of die-hard fans felt like they had been hyper-spaced out of the feel and flow of the Star Wars Universe. This was a massive undertaking for Abrams to complete the Skywalker Saga, Disney's Star Wars style, and he did the best he could with Kathleen Kennedy at the helm of LucasFilm...ugh. Reports are now coming out that Disney halted Abrams from showing the ""Star Wars"" version he wanted to for Episode 9, so I'm not going to blame him for some of the plot holes in this movie. However, if you're a Star Wars fan, this movie is fast paced, full of surprises, light-saber duels AGAIN, and Princess Leia is treated with honor & respect, although the scenes feel quirky at best! Not a bad Star Wars film, just better than the Last one!",0
7526,5.0,"Ok. So let me start off by saying I understand partly where the critics are coming from. It doesn't contain the same originality as the first series...erm....newsflash, it's not original!!!<br /><br />Also, it isn't the conglamorate of new ideas, new plots, new characters and a new world that star wars created first time around. Does that make it bad? No!!!!",0
7527,8.0,With amazing character development and fast paced action its one of the best films in the franchise.,1
7528,10.0,"The only thing I can say about this movie is... well, at least its over. Now the star wars universe can finally get out of the Skywalker shadow and move on to bigger and better things.",0
7529,10.0,I enjoyed this film as I have the other star wars films. I felt it was much better than the last jedi but it wasn't the best star wars film ever. It was a bit cheesy in places but what star wars film isn't. If you like star wars overall then ignore the haters with their negativity and go make your own mind up,1
7530,5.0,"I disagree with many, many of the plot decisions in this film, which I feel were either out of place, unnecessary or straight up damaging the world of Star Wars. Yet it had a lot of potential, the story was very close to being the perfect ending. Hopefully someone'll fix it somehow...",1
7531,7.0,"It's too long, overstuffed, has at least 3 endings and twice as many climaxes, and I loved every damn minute...damn it!",1
7532,4.0,"I went with 2 ppl who hated The Last Jedi. they both said it was good, and one said it might be his fave... idk what else to say. the only thing that (sorta) bugs me is how obv it is that they came up with a script that deliberately counters The Last Jedi, but that script is pretty f'ing awesome, imo. decide for yourself.... 🖖",0
7533,7.0,Expect great FXs and a template starwars movie:<br /><br />1) war scenes<br /><br />2) bla bla non sense<br /><br />3) final war scene with no hope of winning<br /><br />4) winning<br /><br />It's like written by Greeks but actually empty.,1
7534,8.0,Incredible ending to a story that will never end.<br /><br />JJ Abrams is a genius.,1
7535,5.0,"I really, REALLY enjoyed both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Their different tones and visions had more positive aspects than negative ones, for me.",1
7536,10.0,"Ignore the ridiculous 10/10 reviews, they don't know, understand nor love Star Wars which this it's obviously not. This is Disney SW a horrendously bad knock off that I will never regard as cannon, since it's utter garbage and an insult to the real Star Wars and everybody involved in it. If you don't believe me, believe Mark Hamill, John Boyega and Anthony Daniels, all of which have expressed their dislike of Disney Star Wars. If you like unintelligent cash grabs filled with bland empty characters, crappy rip off plots with zero redeeming qualities, this trilogy definitely is for you, but if you're a fan of OG Star Wars you'll hate this (and will be called a hater by those who don't get OG SW and are satisfied with worthless knock offs). So I recommend for you to watch it and see how crappy it is for yourself, just don't waste your money and follow Mark Hamill's advice to wait for it's release on cable. Also if you want your review to count don't give it less than 3 stars or it won't affect the overall result which is probably why it has 7 stars.",0
7537,5.0,Outstanding send off to a great story! JJ fulfills all expectations with many emotional moments. Great way to end a story that has been 42 years in the making,1
7538,3.0,"Made me cry, made my hands shake. Although left many questions unanswered, it enters the all time 3. I don't get how you didn't enjoy it. Kiss completely unnecessary.",1
7539,10.0,"Altogether I had a great time watching this movie, the action was exciting and it had good humor which didn't feel like a forced laugh, but the movie does come with a few flaws.<br /><br />Like in TFA, JJ decided to play safe. You can really feel the difference between what he had in mind and what RJ had did for the previous installment with a rushed exposition that feels like the movie started from the middle, and it ignored a lot of the key plot points that happened in TLJ to put the story back on JJ's storyline.<br /><br />Despite all that I still think this is a good Star Wars movie and the best in it's trilogy with a nearly perfect ending, and it would've been too, if JJ would've avoided some cliche storytelling.",1

7541,,Enjoyable and fun down to the last minute! Worth the watch and a great redemption after the Trainwreck of the last jedi,1
7542,9.0,"If Episode I II III consist a nostalgic European story of love and lust, and Episode IV V VI presents a classic American tale of courage and redemption, then Episode VII VIII and IX is a saga of balance, the saga of this generation, a saga that this century deserves.",1
7543,8.0,Today I went to see the rise of Skywalker with a very negative attitude.<br /><br />Maybe not as quite good as the originals but as fan I thought it was very good and on a par with the Force awakens which I enjoyed very much.,1
7544,8.0,"A sterling soundtrack, brilliant set and costume design alongside spectacular effects can not save The Rise of Skywalker. This film has completely undone everything set up in the superior 'The Last Jedi' in order to cater to the group of fans who didn't get or appreciate what that film was doing.",1
7545,8.0,"As a long time star wars fan, episode IX has a total absence of story and imagination.<br /><br />The feelings and the passion expressed in the movie are frustratingly fake.<br /><br />This last trilogy (along with SOLO) makes me feel nostalgic of  Binks.",1
7546,5.0,"What a great way to end a franchise! I know that this is supposed to be the last one, but honestly, the force is too strong. I believe it's the end...for now. I believe Star Wars will be back within the next 15-20 years",1
7547,1.0,This is the first movie I have watched at the cinema where I just wanted the movie to end as soon as possible. I did not enjoy it the least. It was insufferable to watch as I was eager to leave out of boredom.,0
7548,9.0,"I'm not gonna include spoilers but just to say, Rise of Skywalker is not as bad as people say it is. Although around the start it was quite slow and misdirecting, the rest of the movie was absolutely amazing. I would give this a 10/10 if the start didn't start in close-quarter action. I really hope Disney comes up with more movies like Rouge One and Solo. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is an amazing movie with lots of action (not too much) and lots of story (likewise).",1
7549,2.0,"Full disclosure, I'm a Star Wars fanatic. Everything up until episode XIII. Of which I'll refrain from raging upon that dumpster fire (too late?).",1
7550,9.0,2 bad 2 see so many fake reviews.,0
7551,6.0,"The big problem with the new trilogy is that there was no story to tell. At least with the much maligned prequels, there was a tale that - it could be argued - needed telling.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment with these new films is the 2 dimensional characters. Even the return of the emperor is a let down. I remember as a child first witnessing Palpatine in TESB and having a shiver down my spine. In this latest installment, Darth Sidious is reduced to a - at best - scooby do baddie. At one point during the end I even expected his to announce that he would got away with it if it wasn't for those pesky kids, while Rey pulls off his face mask to reveal that all along, Palpatine was only old man Johnson, the caretaker of the death star.<br /><br />The big opportunity lost here was to really develop Kylo Ren - the whole focus should have been more on a character that may have had a chance to be fully developed.<br /><br />Having said all that, my 6 year old son loved it and surely this is always been the target audience for star wars through the generations and not really for older people like me trying to grapple hold of a long lost childhood dream of swinging a lightsaber with ernest",0
7552,7.0,I have seen this movie twice. I really liked it!,1
7553,6.0,I really don't understand the negative reviews. This is a great movie and of course different from the others it is full of action and a good story line. A lot is happening and that causes may be to give the impression that it is a bit rushed.<br /><br />Me and a friend loved it (and yes we also saw all previous episodes).<br /><br />Go watch it if you didn't already!,1
7554,9.0,"So as a huge (and I mean HUGE) Star Wars fan I was so nervous going in to the theater...<br /><br />After the film ended I felt dissapointed and confused...<br /><br />Today I watched it for a second time and something stood out to me. I actually really enjoyed it and was having an amazing time watching it! I came out of the theaters so happy! Overall, I think my nerves were in the way of enjoying the movie the first time...",1
7555,9.0,"The disenchantment of this trilogy really destroys my ability to sit down and enjoy an original (well made) Star Wars film as it can't seem to find it's potential. Shot down in flames by hi7;s apparent 'cinematic failure' of a film The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker focuses more on the mess that Rian had left from the other film more than its own story by which it's really trying to tell. I felt there was supposed to be something huge in this film but it was like it couldn't reach that potential of a larger scale because of its inability to forget and move on. This film tried its hardest to subtly retcon everything The Last Jedi did meanwhile trying to balance it out with decent storytelling, but if you don't plan out a trilogy with a basic idea of where you want it to go by the last movie, maybe you shouldn't of made the film or at least given the trilogy more thought? Sounds like common sense to me.",0
7556,,"If you saw the entire star wars universe you will realise it.<br /><br />Rey is not the legite skywalker, kylo is. So why force this idea on Rey? She is a weak caracter and you cant like it even if you want. Like if she was related to Luke, like a lost daughter or someting like that i would buy it. She is in a constant struggle to find herself to realize she is the daughter of a sith lord...<br /><br />Tell me, how can a ""noob"" or jedi master i dont know what kylo is bring someone from the dead. It was supposed that only a sith lord have the Power or knowledge to do it. Did kylo learn it from snoke? I guess we will never know it. But lets face it, anakin went to the dark side to learn this power in order to save padme and lost his mind and sense to try it.",0
7557,3.0,"I went in with low expectations. I didn't like the Last Jedi at all, so I was expecting the same kind of crap. This one wasn't nearly ad bad as that. The way the characters interact with one another was very well done, not to mention the actors great performances. The fight scenes were exciting, and some scenes carried a lot of emotional weight.<br /><br />It was a bit predictable, though. After a certain thing is revealed, you can pretty much piece together what's going to happen next. There were also a few cheesey jokes that I, personally, didn't like very much. Just felt unnecessary and a waste of time.<br /><br />If you've been a fan since childhood, I recommend. It's an ""okay"" conclusion.",0

7564,10.0,"This is a very hard movie to rate. I usually enjoy all things star wars, atleast somewhat. The originals have the best story, the prequels have the best battles and characters, the new trilogy has the best special effects but that's about it.

7566,5.0,"I was hyped since first trailer came out. I belived in J.J. Abrams, even when I didn't like The Force Awakens. The Rise of Skywalker is total failure to me. This movie has so many weak story solutions and holes in screenplay. I don't know why Disney hired Chris Terrio to write screenplay. I remind that he co-wrote Justice League and Batman v Superman, two of the most criticized films lately. Only Adam Driver is good in that movie, except his lasts scenes in this movie. I don't know how they could mess up the final chapter in Skywalker saga. I'm very disappointed.",0
7567,9.0,"This film wraps up the Skywalker Saga very well. It incorporates elements of each film of the series to give a nostalgic feel, adds a whole other level of complexity to the plot, is visually stunning and funny. The plot of the saga as a whole is like Swiss cheese, but it's done so in a mystical kind of way that is appropriate. The writers did an excellent job of concluding the confused storyline, the actors mostly did a good job portraying their characters with depth, the score was excellent and the special effects were epic!",1
7568,3.0,"For a starter I want to clarify that I created an account due to inspiration from episode IX, I felt like I needed to truly express my exasperation with the film instead of constantly moaning to my friends about my displeasure. Admittedly enjoying the Force Awakens, finding it an above average star wars entry, followed up by massive dissapointment concerning the Last Jedi, I was very apprehensive and concerned for the finale to the saga. Nevertheless I went to the midnight showing in the UK, relatively excited. Once the movie was over I cannot express how dissapointing and rushed the film feels. I understand that JJ (director) aims for a quickly paced, energetic story, however, constant cuts plagued the film causing it to be forced along with very little narative. I feel like alot of these faults with the film were due to the Lacklustre decision made in the Last Jedi, but the film had problems of its own. Characters from previoud films felt completely shoe horned in just for the sake of it, likrwise new characters felt completely one dimensional, unlikable and useless. It was agrivating how disjointed the film felt, seemingly just jumping from one random plot point to the next, and by the end of the run time it feels exhausting and a complete waste of time and money. I feel like my opinion is very devisive as some may enjoy it, but i struggle to see how anyone can see past the major flaws that this movie has. I feel like if i pointed out everything that i felt was wrong with this film I would be babbling on. I honestly reccomend you save your money because in my hinest opinion it has nothing to offer and is possibly the worst in the whole series.",0
7569,9.0,"You all can complain all you want.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams has made an incredible movie. He fixed all the mess from the previous episode. He gives us back the dignity of Star Wars universe, the respect for the light sabre, the friendship, the strength, the fear, the love and the sacrifice.<br /><br />Visually The Rise of Skywalker is incredible.<br /><br />You are complaining about Palpatine's role? It's much easier to understand that he, the Sith who has all the siths in him, has been behind everything and he is the one who created Snoke. Snoke has been explained, successfully.<br /><br />Leia's character has been proven to be essential and powerful. Not like the ridiculous scene of her flying on the space. She is strong, she has moved her sons heart to the light using the force and her love.<br /><br />I could continue, but in resume, it is a great last episode.",1

7571,10.0,Better than I thought it would be. Only wish Anakin as a force ghost would have had more to do with redeeming Ben,0
7572,7.0,"Overall, I think this movie was the best case scenario considering what occurred in episode 8. There is a very good attempt to tie in all previous eight movies to make a satisfying ending. I think the entire sequel trilogy suffers from a lack of direction, but I enjoyed the story for what it was and can respect the choices that were made. There was a lot of ground to cover in this movie to get to a somewhat satisfying ending which I feel is why many have called the movie ""hectic"". If you are able to forgive that, then you are left with a well-acted and visually captivating story about good versus evil. This movie is not perfect by any measure, but I left the theatre with a smile on my face.",1

7581,1.0,"A movie that gives a good closure to the skywalker saga, with fun, action and a lot of tears, really loved it.

They try to stick to the same formula they get accused of rehashing the same garbage. Nice finish but JJ but certainly didn't have me clinging to the edge of my seat at the midnight premier...... But was satisfied all that was addressed that needed to be, be glad that the skywalkers and solo's are relegated to prequels and legends now. Hopefully the universe can find some new leads to capture our imagination. Solid performance by Adam Driver pick of the litter for mine, Daisy Ridley was solid as well, Oscar Isaac felt like he phoned it in.",1

Hated palapatine is back meh. Goonies rip off treasure follow the map crap meh! But a Star Wars cash grab by Disney and ""let's make as much money as possible and bleed the Lucas film purchase""!",0

7588,7.0,"After the mediocre Force Awakens and the terrible Last Jedi, went in to see this with the lowest of expectations. And have to say I quite enjoyed it. Beautiful visuals, loads of action, nice farewell to Leia and even slight redemption for Luke. It leaves a bittersweet taste though when you think what this trilogy could and should of been. We could of had Thrawn and Mara Jade, but no, Disney saw fit to jettison all of the great characters built up over years and for what?<br /><br />Still, enjoyable enough send off but a hughly wasted opportunity to off made something great.",0

7591,6.0,"These bad reviews are such arrogant nonsense, do they think they understand Star Wars more than Kathleen Kennedy? I get people are mad Lucas SOLD IT but come on, ep 1-3 were not works of art, remember Jar Jar, and people act like Lucas' dialogue was Tarentino level scripting, it wasn't. Star Wars is supposed to be fun and engaging and this movie has all that. Yes it moves quickly but that's what makes it fun. No one wants a 3 hour dialogue fest and the big reveal of Rey's parents was a great and surprising twist, which people are obviously mad they didn't figure out or doesn't fit in their narrow view of everything. News flash, NONE OF THIS IS REAL, it's called fiction for a reason. This movie is fun, exciting, pays tribute to the Jedi, previous characters, introduces new ones and in iMax is absolutely amazing to experience. And without the Emporer, Rey has no tie to anything in the series so wrapping him in ties it all together and explains the last two movies perfectly. I loved it and going again tomorrow but what do I know, I only saw Star Wars when I was 6.",1
7592,8.0,"If you like space mumbo jumbo and lasers and spaceships, this movie is excellent.<br /><br />If you think Star Wars was a mythology of quality and a story far more than just ""space magic"", then this whole trilogy raises the middle finger to your face.",1

7602,9.0,"Go see the film, judge for yourself!<br /><br />Has everything a Star Wars film should have!",1
7603,6.0,"I have seen this film twice now and I have enjoyed it each time. It's not as bad as a lot of click bait articles out there are going to say. The only real problem I have with this is undeveloped characters with no real arc (Rey, Finn, and Poe) and the fact that it is obvious Disney had no clear road map for this trilogy. I think killing off Snoke in the previous entry really hurt this final chapter and made it feel forced (No pun intended). As far as wrapping up the saga it does a fine job. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was magnificent. Kylo was my favorite part of this trilogy. Definitely still recommend watching this in the the theater for the scope, visuals, and size of this movie.",1
7604,10.0,"This is not a masterpiece. This is no Return of the King-like end to a beloved storyline. But it is the result of a lot of hard work by JJ Abrams' team and it was fun to watch. And, frankly, that'll be enough for most people. ""Episode IX"" is a perfectly enjoyable action film, with thankfully more self-respect than the previous two Rey entries. ""Rise"" (TROS from here on out) asks to be taken seriously, and so I have an easier time doing so. Getting JJ Abrams back just confirms to me that one director should have been at the helm for all three movies, and that creative vision should be kept from excess by more than one person having all the decision-making power. There are definitely course corrections from the Last Jedi, but honestly I can't fault JJ Abrams from making them. The Last Jedi (TLJ) really wanted to be the last movie in the trilogy, and so TROS has to either create new plot lines or reverse certain plot lines' deaths from what TLJ said. As I will say several times here, I don't think that TROS needed more exposition, so I'm not sure what else TROS could do but get out of the corner TLJ had painted it into. Yes, there's also much more fan service here than TLJ. That's totally understandable and within Abrams' right to do, Star Wars is never going to be beloved by critics no matter how much they kiss up so it makes sense to pander to the fans. Lots of movies have had to make changes because ""artistic vision"" sometimes isn't what the audience wants. (Deep Blue Sea, Little Shop of Horrors, Titanic, Pride and Prejudice, 28 Days Later, Scott Pilgrim vs the World, even Oscar-bait The Lovely Bones to name a few had to change their plots to please audiences.) Anyone who thought that ""subverting expectations"" was a viable long-term strategy for a franchise must know something that I don't.",1
7605,6.0,"I had to chuckle and roll my eyes at the over-the-top fan service a few times throughout The Rise of Skywalker, but I still really enjoyed the movie. I knew a lot about the plot going in, so with that in mind I think I liked it better than I feared I would after reading what happens. Many of the occurrences were sort of predictable based on the previous movies. I know that many people may think The Last Jedi threw out the script, but TLJ moved on from The Force Awakens in a way that made sense and was mildly predictable (to me, at least: not everyone makes the same connections and that's okay). That said, I think those moments were done well enough to be enjoyed by most people. My feelings going in were like this: I know what to expect but I'm worried about not enjoying the execution. Well, after seeing the film, I think I worried too much.",1
7606,8.0,"After TLJ my expectations were very low but Abrams really put it together well. He had a lot of work to do to correct everything wrong with the previous installment and he pulled it off finishing the series beautifully.

Episode 9 was the first to fail to foster any emotional investment from me in the narrative or characters. About halfway through the movie, I felt it dragging on and hoped it would just wrap up. This is not a bad or cringeworthy movie but it is terribly dull. Plenty of scenes are copy/pasted from previous adventures. The movie swarms you with a long list of new characters and locations in such a short time that it's impossible to care about any of it. The new cast suffers from awkward dialogue and lack of depth. The completion of their arcs was not emotionally compelling for me.",0

It's very fast paced, has some truly incredible fight scenes and the locations are stunning and I loved the story. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the previous film and felt that Abrams has a huge task on his hands to try and rectify a pretty poor film in The Last Jedi. I really think he did an excellent job.",1
7615,8.0,"I hated the Last Jedi for what it did to Luke and to the story arcs set-up in the Force Awakens. I was set on boycotting the Rise of Skywalker. After reading some reviews from trusted reviewers, I went to watch the movie. To my pleasant surprise, the movie was surprisingly good. It did a good job at turning things around from what happened in the Last Jedi. It is not perfect, but having to complete a trilogy without a proper second movie is a difficult task. And I think they did a good job bringing the trilogy to a close and also finishing the Star Wars saga. I wished they had an outline for the trilogy and had the same movie director and writers for all 3 movies. Let this be an important lesson for future trilogies to not to repeat this stupidity. I encourage Star Wars fans to watch it.",1
7616,8.0,"Not my favourite movie of the saga but I did appreciate the regular linkage to the original trilogy. Interestingly I enjoyed it better on the second viewing with my kids ... perhaps watching Star Wars through the eyes of youth is the best way to enjoy it? While it has flaws, I did like the new characters and overall it is an enjoyable adventure in the Star Wars galaxy. Next step for the franchise? Produce a trilogy as good as the Mandalorian. I would like to see that!",1
7617,8.0,"Going to be subtle. No solid plot line, what plot was there was riddled with holes and completely disregarded the strides George Lucas made with his story telling. Completely lackadaisical and messy. Made unnecessary call backs to previous films, while simultaneously bastardizing said films. Star Wars was always about legacy, and the build up. Well nope, not anymore.",0
7618,7.0,"For anyone who is slightly into math, in terms of quality I would describe the movie a sine curve. For instance, take the interactions between Poe and Finn. At one point you have them fussing on Endor (sorry if I am wrong but I believe the forrest planet was Endor) and you can not help but to cringe at their poorly written conversation that is in fact trying to make you laugh. At another point they are arguing on on the planet where the Death Star crashed and as Finn walks away Poe just stands there, anxiously staring into the ground with an amazing scenery of the crashed Millenium Falcon in the background. Many people who grew up with the original trilogy and already had their hopes down walking into the theatre most likely only took the negative aspects into consideration while grading the movie. But for an actuall movie grading, disregarding the positive aspects would not be fair. Characterwhise I was fairly disappointed to see the only character ever I found quite interesting be pointlessly killed off. I guess they did not think it possible, introducing this character to the rebels as a sith gone good after all they had been through. So they pulled a Darth Vader on him. The Emperor was very shallow. They made him into the typical powerfull, evil bad guy who just wants to be powerfull and evil for no motive what so ever. They never developed on Finn and Rose. After all, they were proven to just be put in place for casting diversity. Finn's biggest moment was when he had a ""feeling"", where I found it quite silly gambling the entire rebel fleet based on his feeling. Rey turned out to be a Palpatine and that I actually thought of as an excellent explanation for her background, justifying her critized and nearly ridiculous powers that she attained over such a short span of time. One moment of the movie however which I absolutely despiced was ""all jedis vs all sith"". What made it even worse was Rey holding two lightsabers crossed. At that point it just felt like MCU. In summary: The movie is fairly bad plotwhise and they should have taken way more time writting the script. What weights up he movie are the interactions between Kylo Ren and Rey, aswell as the A level sound and special effects. The overall design of the movie is top notch. Therefore I do not think the movie deserves anything more or less than 7/10. Personally I mostly watch movies 8/10 or above and would not have seen this film if it was not for the SW title.",0
7619,2.0,"Better than 8 and 7.<br /><br />The ending is reasonable which compensates the plot in 7n8. With imax the graph is epic, even better than avenger end game. So there's nothing else to complaine.",0
7620,7.0,"As a film, probably just ok. The is more watchable than all three prequels. Worse than the original three, worse than Rogue One and Force Awakens. Probably on par with Last Jedi and Solo as a watchable move. However, in 4dx it was an amazing experience. The movies need to offer an experience not available at home. While I don't think all movies would be good in 4dx, this one was made for it, which possibly explains why so many who saw it in other formats had negative reactions. 4dx is NOT for those prone to motion sickness.",0

You won't be disappointed with the ending of the Starwars story that's been over 40 years in the making. Read tons and tons of critics straight stiff arm to the face this movie days before it was released. And i felt it was unwarranted. You need to keep in mind there was 8 movies prior to this one and I feel you must touch on all of them to give the final movie it's drive. And it was done quickly at times but not to the point where it didn't make sense. Super star destroyers with Death Star like cannons ....alright a little over board. But you can't let things like that Ruin the whole experience.,0

7632,7.0,"This film got an incredibly bad rep. Naturally it was not as good as the original trilogy, but of course it's not. There are such high standards for Star Wars films now because most fans want the new films to make them feel like the originals. Part of that 'feeling' is the fact that both the original and the prequels came out a while ago, and as a result people would have seen star wars, this huge extravagant sci-fi adventure, as children, when everything you saw would be mind blowing. My mum for instance (who i saw the film with) hated all the prequels because they didn't feel like the originals she saw as a child, whereas i loved them, because they came out as i was a kid.",1

However, the momentum starts growing and from the second act I started enjoying it very much. Is there fan service? Yes. Is it bad? Hell no! I think that JJ wanted to course correct into what he imagined this trilogy to be. They had issues (the most tragic one being Carrie's death) they had to cope with, but this is overall a great movie! Loved the new characters, loved all the droids. Even with all the fan service, there was an ending that was unexpected, although I am a huge Star Wars fan who had seen all the movies and rest of content a gazillion times and watched every youtube review and video in the past.",1

Something I never understood with the sequels is that they made the plot as they went along. It would have made much more sense to have a preplanned idea where we could see certain characters grow and theorize in different ways.",0

A big applause to the team that made this happen.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the bad stuff...<br /><br />Not once in the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes was I on the edge of my seat. You can't be sucked into this movie because it's very predictable. It seems like the writer took everything from return of the jedi (and made it worse). The stuff that happens sometimes even seems over the top (yes I know it's a star wars movie).<br /><br />The end of the movie was just... very bad. There were some scenes that were just very bad written and not fit within the story. I can go on and on with this, but I think I made my point clear.<br /><br />Let me just say that it's not impossible to please a Star Wars fan. At the end of the movie a lot of answers from the first two movies were answered by things suggested by the fans. This is wasn't good as it raised more questions.<br /><br />A lot of people are saying that the film wasn't that bad. Let's just say that it was.",0

7642,,"Let me start off by saying this, I have been quite unimpressed with the direction of the new sequels so far. I found TFA to be dull and uninspired while TLJ was too brash and heavy handed. I must say that for this finale to the saga, JJ hit the perfect balance of everything Star Wars needs. I won't act like the movie wasn't predictable, but that's okay because personally I got everything I could have wanted out of this film. It addresses every question I was left scratching my head over after The Last Jedi and somehow ties the first two movies of the sequel (which seem to contradict each other so greatly) together in a way that makes sense for the story. I was very satisfied with the explanation of Rey's background, and even though I found her a bit hard to root for before, by the end of the film I felt really good about seeing her overcome her past and succeed. Daisy Ridley is absolutely beautiful in this movie, and I found myself very emotionally invested in seeing her close off her journey. Ben Solo' finally gets the treatment he deserves as a character, in a way he got the best possible outcome for a man who had done so much damage in the galaxy. Adam Driver gives a heartrending performance in this movie, I would even go on to call it the best I've seen in a Star Wars movie.<br /><br />Overall I found this movie both breathtaking and satisfying, and I'm glad I went into it with an open mind rather than looking for things to hate. No it wasn't perfect, at times it felt rushed and almost methodical, and the majority outcomes were very easy to predict. But in my opinion, this film perfectly combines nostalgia and familiarity with interesting new concepts, does a good job of honouring past characters while giving a platform to the new ones.",1

7647,9.0,"The movie answers all questions that anyone has ever had from these last films in the first 2/3's of the movie and then the end wasn't really worth it. This was supposed to be the final battle. There should have been more. Yes we all loved how they included every single ship when reinforcements came in for the resistance. But with Palpatine there should have been more from him. He is the major reason why all of this started besides Darth Plagueis. There should have been a more epic battle between him, Rey, and Ben. I also did not like how Ben died. I mean I understand because the whole ""new beginning"" and ""start from scratch"" deal because Ben was the last Skywalker and the Skywalkers all started with Anakin who was created by midichlorians because Plagueis and Sidious manipulated them.

I did like the story lines in this movie, with palpetine returning and all, but they should have set this up in a previous film. Right now it felt a bit random and easy done by just saying 'Palpatine returned' in the opening scroll. I think everything that happend in this film could have been made in two films and if they would have skipped 8 how it is now and filled 8 and 9 with the story of 9 this trilogy would have been awesome. So in itself the film was alright and enjoyable, but the trilogy is a mess. They should have figured out the main story before starting with 7 instead of figuring it out along the way, because now it doesn't feel as one story.",1
7651,8.0,"Many long-time fans of cinema have been very sad and angry about the direction that modern blockbusters have gone lately, focusing mostly on cheap thrills, action or weak and expectable interpretations of love and other emotions (often completely overwhelmed by the action-sequences). People seemingly look at this phenomenon as a virus or a plague, that corrupts the film-industry, taking over their favorite franchises and directors, picturing a scene in their heads, in which the vicious businessmen are offering them an incredible amount of money in exchange for downgrading their carrier into making crowdpleasers without any form of depth, original ideas or new forms of portraying stories. I am not saying that this is untrue. If we look at the whole picture and the amount of money that they're spending on these films, we might see that it is kind of sad, thinking how that money could have been spent on several smaller, but from an artistic angle way more promising productions. But I think that that is the whole point: you don't need hundreds of millions to make a good movie, fantastic films are being made today with the budget of literally 2 seconds of a movie like The Rise of Skywalker. When we see a blockbuster movie, like a Marvel production, we might get sad thinking that this is indeed what people desire today, that they rather want to feel their heart pumping during a chase-scene or a battle than to dwell on the deaper meanings of a movie for weeks. We might think that they are just young people, not educated enough or not smart enough to understand the actually good movies, but I am not seeing so much of a problem here as others. The smallest thing we should be worried about today is the lack of recognition of talent. Money and care being put into finding and fostering talented people is higher than it has ever been. The fact that from a financial standpoint, blockbusters take up the biggest part of the film-industry doesn't mean that they take away the chances of the smaller filmakers or studios and their more artistic productions, it just means that the whole thing is growing in a scale that is unimaginable. If the majority of people, mostly young people look at the cinema as a fun-park not a museum, that way most cinemas will eventually adapt to fulfilling their desires.But, my opinion being based on personal experience, I can wholeheartedly promise that one day those young people might discover the actual power of stories, the beuty of movies and start to make their way into looking at film from a more artistic angle. And I think that the people who despise this new direction of mainstream movies, should get confortable and enjoy the flashes and the heat of explosions and battles, instead of searching for depth and thinking of ways in which what they see could have been executed better.",1

Not because i'm a die-hard fan or because i think the canon story-line should be preserved; rather it's because the core template or formula that made the first few movies successful does not apply to the recent movies; These movies have no coherent plot and the audience is not fully invested in the characters.",0

7663,10.0,"This is the first movie I have seen in 4DX and it was amazing experience! Absolutely loved the film. It tied up the threads from the other films very well. If you love star wars you will love this. But the 4DX just takes it to another level. It really left me with a feel good buzz, like I truly had just experienced something amazing. I'm going to spend the rest of the weekend watching all the other episodes and when I'm done play the lego star wars saga. Happy days!",1
7664,9.0,"This movie is alot crammed into 2 hours and 30 minutes but glad it wasn't split up into 2 movies. It had great visuals, tugged at the heart strings on more than one occasion and had unexpected twists. I loved the 3D effects and feel it added to the movie in several occasions. Die hard Star Wars nerds will always complain so shut up buttercup, this movie was excellent and accomplished everything I wanted it to. Not a perfect movie but very solid and I left the theater happy.",1
7665,8.0,"I'm someone who has been very critical of Disney Star Wars. Force Awakens was decent but The Last Jedi was trash. But what was truly bad was not the film, but how Rian Johnson, Kennedy and Disney handled the criticism.<br /><br />Honestly, I had no interest in this film, in the new trilogy or in Disney Star Wars. I wasn't even planning to see it, but eventually went anyway JUST to see how badly they made it up.I had zero expectations.",0
7666,9.0,"So, I love Star Wars. Prime films, spinoffs, live action or animated. I live the games, I love the books.<br /><br />What went wrong with this film? They tried too hard.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story; the direction things took, unexpected twists, new lightsaber designs, Legends characters coming back into canon...",1
7667,4.0,Anyone who loves and is well experienced with this franchise and it's expanded universe should be mortified by this entire trilogy's failure to even try and be faithful to its lore.,0
7668,5.0,"I don't usually write reviews but, this was Awful! Just awful! They killed off the best part of this series. #bensolodeservedbetter",0
7669,3.0,"Rushed, the film was rushed and a lot of random new elements were introduced on what was meant to be a climactic end to a saga.",0
7670,1.0,Watched once in the theater and just now on Disney plus. It's not perfect but considering all it had to accomplish in the last chapter I really enjoyed it.,1
7671,5.0,It ain't no Marvel endgame<br /><br />As rushed as it was it was still pretty.,1
7672,8.0,"The movie is not actually terrible in some places. It's a fantasy adventure action movie with albeit featureless characters and unmotivated actions though, but not much in the way of a Star Wars movie. It's just incredibly generic and bland, you could probably have put the same story into the Xena franchise and made a more interesting movie from that, as it's gotten less of a space fantasy movie and more of a high fantasy narrative.<br /><br />The narrative connections between TRoS and the other two sequels are... pretty much nonexistent except from an interpretational point of view. You could very well have forgone with the other two movies - or with this one, as it's the least structured or well told of them all.<br /><br />Some MacGuffins could be taken directly from a badly written text adventure.",0
7673,7.0,It gives a complete ending of the whole story and hope there will not have any side story.,1
7674,3.0,No Star Wars film is without faults. But The Rise of Skywalker has surpassed my expectations and made me proud to be a Star Wars fan again.,0
7675,8.0,"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is a 2019 film starring Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and Mark Hamil. The film is the third in the trilogy of movies made by disney after the buyout of lucas film. One of the first things I noticed about the film is that the fact that instead of continuing the story of The Last Jedi it mostly retconned the events of the last Jedi to instead play it safer and due to this it hurts the movie mostly on the screenplay level. I feel the writing was the worst during the very beginning of the movie when it seemed the mediocre editing of the movie mixed with Underwhelming writing left the beginning few scenes not seeming finished and left open to mesh with the scene before and after it and the very end of the movie were it seemed dragged out to the fullest where when Kylo Ren was holding Rey's passed out body he sits there sighing for a good 90 seconds. Besides that the movie had good shot direction. You could tell that all the main actors genuinely cared about their role with Adam Driver ging another terrific performance this year alongside Marriage Story. I feel that the disney trilogy of films Started off with The Force Awakens an above average slight reboot of A New Hope then switching to a very original and refreshing film witch for the first time in a long time a disney movie that feels made by a dierector with a vistion instead of a group of prouducers and focus groups and now were finally here not counting the spinoffs, but the movie overall feels fine since I have to watch through a good few of my dvds The Rise Of Skywalker will mostly float out of my mind fairley soon but for now Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker a 4/10",0
7676,8.0,Why read this or any other review when you can just experience the awe of Star Wars. Enough said.,0
7677,3.0,"I finally broke down and went to see this....movie. First, it was about an hour too long, and I yawned throughout most of it. It was a bad retelling of ""Return of the Jedi."" SO much was never explained and things just ""magically"" happened. IT was purely populist Disney drivel. Of course, Disney's trademark showed at the end during the celebratory scene. Only one couple kissed and, you guessed it, it was a gay couple. Just couldn't help themselves. It just seemed the whole movie was a hodgepodge of cut-scenes trying to finish this and get something on the screen to make the $$. Now I know why George Lucas was so upset with this last trilogy, and I blame him for this fiasco - he should have never sold out to Disney.",0

7679,3.0,"The 'last' (and I emphasise last as there is likely to be another 27) instalment in the Star Wars saga was meant to have it all but instead had all the ingredients of a narrative failure. The obvious, rushed attempt of trying to have it all only highlighted the true essence of the narrative mess.",0
7680,7.0,"Let's start by the positives. Music is great, like it always has been. Special effects are on point, as you would expect. But I trully feel like the plotholes really hurt the film. For example: Palpatine is alive? Not even slightly explained in the film. Also, there were a plethora of unexplained and totally out of place moments. In the end, i.e. Rey kisses Ben. For what reason? That's only a glimpse of what someone might encounter while watching this film.",0
7681,4.0,"I know I already added a warning, but spoiler alert anyways.",0
7682,7.0,Saw SW ROS yesterday. If you have been following some of the side stories as told in Clone Wars and SW Rebels you will realize that some of what has happened in the movie is expected. Is the movie perfect. No. But not a single SW movie except Empires Strikes Back is perfect. I cried. I laughed. i cheered. Thank you J.J.,1
7683,3.0,"Ever since Star Wars was sold to Disney in 2012, the franchise as we knew it died. Lucas and co. were the only ones who knew how to make Star Wars because they created it. Disney has used this and the large fan base simply for money. They didn't even have to try, it's all been a money grab. Every piece of Star Wars created since 2012 other than the sequel trilogy has been far better than these pathetic moneygrabs. It's Star Wars, so I had to watch them to see how it ended. But it sure was a bad ending. The Last Jedi did kind of set this one up for failure, and this movie was obviously in damage repair mode. Overall, I will continue to follow Star Wars because I cannot wait to see the rest of the Mandalorian series and the premiere of the Kenobi series. Both will be far better than the sequel trilogy, no doubt.",0
7684,9.0,"Boring.. Lots of chasing, blasts, felt like I was watching a long trailor without much story, charectors who die and come back alive.. Very very sad to once a mighty franchise",0
7685,5.0,"It delivered very well on atmosphere, visuals and action. I could be critical maybe about the plot but this was a proper Star Wars movie and I thought it was great. One star reviews are ridiculous, these people need to get a grip! This was easily the closest the new trilogy got to the original and a massive improvement on the last two.",1
7686,5.0,I was worried that it would be bad. I loved it. I was a kid when Attack of the clones came out. I didn't love it. No one was talking about it. And I didn't love The last jedi. This might be the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi.,1
7687,4.0,"Ok, I watched this. Just came from the cinema. And I would say that this film is strange. Really strange.",0
7688,9.0,"The graphic effects were very good<br /><br />The story was also acceptable, but the story hole in my opinion is that it should have better explained how the main villain of the film came back.",0
7689,6.0,Loved it........ don't read reviews and just hi and watch it,1
7690,10.0,"I think this movie was much better then the second one. Many things that are interesting with this movie and it's a worth a see movie.<br /><br />I'm giving this movie a 8/10 just because of the music, GFX Graphic Design and the actors.",1
7691,10.0,"I know nothing about Star Wars when I watched this with my brother, and I absolutely have no idea why some people don't like it. But all I know is that the lightsabers are awesome!",1
7692,8.0,"Star Wars has always been great, great storyline, great actors, and good editing. This movie kinda disappointed me because the almost have the same storyline as the last ones. It was like bad guy to good guy, movie over. There is also a lot that we didn't get what was Finn was going to tell Rey which was a disappointment. It makes wait for another movie. The music as almost the same as the Last Jedi. The first dialogue was at like the 5 minute mark. I hope they can get better writers for the next one.",0
7693,9.0,"To take it to the point:<br /><br />No consistent storyling<br /><br />Bad acting in general<br /><br />At some point I thought Michael Bay was the director (it is impossible to polish crap with visual effects)<br /><br />Pointless characters, every one but Rey is uselles",0
7694,9.0,I have mixed feelings for sure. On the one hand while I watched this movie I bought into the emotion of it and walked away feeling good about it. On the other hand if it is picked apart at all there is a lot to be annoyed with. As much as everyone hated the Last Jedi this movie just ignores that it happened in favor of doing its own thing. I think that choice does a disservice to this movie and Star Wars as a whole.,1
7695,6.0,"Forget all the negative reactions around , go see it for yourself, really enjoyed it from a lifelong fan.",1
7696,7.0,"A bit tightened, a bit messy, but ok.<br /><br />Haters gonna hate.",1
7697,9.0,The story put me to sleep but the craftsmanship is fascinating. I wish some really gifted writers would lift this story line and move it forward using 21st century physics and pushing the envelope. It seems just a kids movie now lots of noise and violence ...too bad it has such potential.,0
7698,10.0,😱😱😱😍😍😍,0
7699,7.0,"Loved it! Saw it twice and loved it even more the second time. The pacing in the beginning can feel a little rushed but soon a re watch it felt more cohesive. It's a beautiful film with great practical effects. Story wise, it did a good job of tying in the last Jedi and the twist has me excited to rewatch the new trilogy with this new perspective.",1
7700,9.0,"So I'm not a puritan I collected the figures as a young fellow and it was a big part of my childhood, I enjoyed the originals. When they reworked the story to start a new trilogy of course they butchered the originals. Let's face it balance was brought to the force and then it was undone and needed balance again. They could do this again for the next generation, and again, that's Hollywood. Then of course they blur what balance is, you cant have good without bad and who's good and who's really bad? However this trilogy conclusion does have highlights, good prevails and there is hope for the bad guy. In the end bad is bad and good is good. That's what the universe wants, isn't it? The actors seemed to finally get that chemistry they lacked, and came into there own. The fight choreography was good as well as great special effects. There was some subliminal innuendo that I was disappointed at for a Disney movie in the last celebration scene, blink and you will miss it. Over all the feeling of good defying the odds and triumphing is prevalent in this movie and that's what we loved about the originals and this ending has that. Definitely worth a watch!",1
7701,8.0,"So as I'm a huge fan of Star Wars since a long time ago I'll try to not let my fan mind speaking : JJ Abrams made a great movie, of course there is some fan service but the movie is quite nice and there is a lot of good things. My advice : go and watch it you'll make your own opinion",1
7702,7.0,I'm a core fan and pretty happy with this ending.. J.J. did good,1
7703,8.0,"It is perplexing to me that an entity as big as Disney would undertake a multi billion dollar investment without a creative director to oversee the large plot developments over three movies. You want different directors to helm the three different movies? Fine, you still need someone steering the ship. ROS's biggest issue is there just isn't enough time to cover all that it did adequately. This last movie alone could have been a 10 episode series in and of itself.<br /><br />This movie appeared to attempt two large undertakings: complete the trilogy arch and walk back much TLJ. Tough to accomplish in a 2 hour movie and you would not have needed to undertake task two had someone at Disney steered the ship other than letting the directors piece mail the trilogy. The trilogy as a whole could have been executed much better and therefore this movie would have been better.",0
7704,8.0,I liked it.,1
7705,6.0,"Put simply, I loved it. Any criticisms of it that I may have are FAR outweighed by the positives. It is a highly entertaining and action packed film with twists and turns that kept me captivated throughout. After being disappointed with The Last Jedi I am now pleased to say that I thoroughly enjoyed The Rise Of Skywalker, I'm happy with the unfolding story - and I can't wait to see it again. A love letter to the disillusioned fans? Who cares?!! Well done JJ Abrams, you got me!! Disney hasn't ruined MY childhood - my poor memory has!!!... but I'm going to remember the first time I watched The Rise Of Skywalker for a long time to come!! All about the film - and not about my first experience ever of Gold Class VIP fully reclining seats and the complete absence of glaring mobile phone screens and fellow cinema goers talking and munching throughout the whole viewing!! That's just a bonus!! Loved it.",1
7706,8.0,Although this is not the best Star Wars film out there it is the best since the original 3. It tied in all 9 movies from the saga and I feel it ended good. Yeah there would be a few tweaks I would of seen differently but you can't be perfect in a movie almost impossible. I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I'm happy the way it went out.,1
7707,8.0,"I really enjoyed this film. It isn't perfect, but it has so many joyful moments that you'd have to be a fairly jaded fan to not get some enjoyment out of it. Was astounded to read the negative press about the film, it was at the very least a fun ride. I personally felt it surprised me in a lot of wonderful ways, and left me with a few years by the end few scenes. A fitting end, can't wait to see it a few more times.",1
7708,9.0,"First of all i really liked The Last Jedi, and if you are a Star Wars Fan that is a bit educated you will get it.<br /><br />Now the Rise of Skywalker had some great Moments and Topics with requires some thoughts and at least two viewings.<br /><br />The only Problem is the Beginning which is a little bit bumpy because they trie to satisfied the idiots from the idiots the fandom menace.<br /><br />I hope in the Future does not trie to please these idiots which are absolut uneducated click baiting parasites, with these kinds of idiots like Geeks and Gamers great cinema is not possible. We as real Film Fans should despise these Kinds of Fans. Destroy them",1
7709,9.0,"Getting angry makes you look effected by things changing around you (like you weren't aware of coming changes) and out of control and in my opinion this Star Wars trilogy was all about unstable whiners who make terrible choices all the time never learn from it, just change the music to something inspired and they become focused. Twist to twist to twist it's so freakin INTERESTING. Seriously, palp had no family he's basically a sith demon, hux did not turn on the first order why would he?",0
7710,8.0,"""A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect"" as does this film. How this film has come out with a lower rating than The Last Jedi is astonishing. JJ has done a fantastic job trying to fix the horror show that Rian created, we saw the Luke Skywalker we all know and love. Palatine being Palpatine, I needn't say more.",1
7711,3.0,Story brought together really well - fantastic and fitting finale to a fabulous modern trilogy. Rey is a sensation.,1
7712,8.0,"This is another classic case of why it's you should never try to severely retcon and reverse things that happened in previous films just cause some fans weren't happy. Despite some of the backlash, the previous film got an amazing score from the critics and will be looked at on a much more positive way in the future but I'm trying to listen to those angry fans and walk back things, you have now created a mess that everyone hates. Fans and critics alike.",1
7713,10.0,"So partly a review of the Rise of Skywalker, partly the latest trilogy. I will try not to put in too many spoilers...",0
7714,4.0,"Overall a very good ending to the saga.<br /><br />Great music. Fun and clear story. Answers questions from 7-8. Wauw to the special effects. Luke from 8 makes sense to me now. I like the dyade thing as it adds to the Force lore.<br /><br />I missed a few things in the movie, but the best movie of the sequel trilogy.<br /><br />Nice of the Mandalorian episode 7 show to canonize Force healing, so all the haters cannot say anythings against that 💪🏻 Thanks Baby Yoda",1
7715,8.0,"I think casual movie goers will feel like its an entertaining film. So go watch it if you like! As for me Im a big star wars fan but i didnt felt anything at all while watching the film. They used the nostalgia power which i thought were cheap tricks. It wasnt all bad but it feels like just damage control from the last jedi. It undermine the previous trilogy plus the plot is really underwhelming. They shove Rey too much to be this big thing even going as far as undermining the whole ""chosen one"" thing, its annoying. I also dont like how it ended as well.",0
7716,9.0,"I'm hardcore fan, so here it goes, I did like the main character been a female , hate all the darth sidious plot. I don't mind killing the skywalker saga but do it with grace with class , nop Disney didt they just wanted to end fast so they can build the new gen Star Wars saga, it's understood George Lucas it's a loser . Anyways I like the actors they did great.",0
7717,6.0,"People who rate this movie a 10 I think saw a fun, non-consequential movie that was a good and entertaining ride. Sure, that's what this it. However, this movie didn't come to us without any context. It's meant to be part of a story arc decades in the making. This is where the 1s come in, to them this movie doesn't stand on its own two feet but on top of 8 other movies. And in that context, it is worthy of only a 1 star rating.<br /><br />Here's the thing: for all their flaws, the prequels added an enormous depth to the original movies. They complimented them. Darth Vader being the best example. Where he previously was just the evil guy with a twist and eventual redemption, the prequels added depth to this character and turned him into the pivotal tragic hero of the saga.<br /><br />Enter the sequels. They do just the opposite. They add no new depth to the story, nothing that could compliment and enhance the previous movies. Instead, for a lack of genuinely new ideas, they make use of existing material whenever it suits to drive their chaotic plot and since it is chaotic indeed, the use turns into misuse and abuse. Best example is before mentioned Darth Vader. While the prequels added depth and drama to his character, this newest installment of the sequels basically negates a central part of his identity within Star Wars lore. For what? To serve as a cheap and easy fix to a messy plot.<br /><br />In that context, I rate this movie a 3 out of 10. If it were one of those unaffiliated SW movies like Rogue One it might have been worth a 6.",0
7718,6.0,"Never had big hopes, but this last movie of a trilogy + 2 spinoff, was able to destroy forever my hope for the state of cinema. In an era where Scorsese produces ty to Netflix a masterpiece, Disney is incapable of place some feelings in 5 movies. All the scripts are flat, the pathos was never invite to take part in the new star wars saga. Maybe was their intent, we are talking of a multibillion dollar company, hard to imagine that a single shot wasn't tested and screened on a microscope of focus group. Maybe the only purpose is to sell what is next, a new TV show or good scenario for video games. On the positive side now I know I can avoid EVERY FUTURE movie with this screenwriter, if justice league and batman VS superman were clues , star wars is the final evidence.",0

7721,8.0,"I have one criteria for any movie. Was I entertained? As for SWTROS, the answer is yes! The visuals and cinematography were amazing, musical score was rousing and the story line brought the saga full-circle in a fitting way while paying proper homage to the originals. I saw the original in 1977 when fourteen years old. It was a magical moment. The fact that I'm still watching Star Wars movies with my sons this many years later is a gift. Are the movies perfect? No, that is impossible. But, being a part of ""outrage culture"", hating anything and everything that doesn't align with your beliefs and expectations, needs to stop. Lighten up and be thankful for the people who bring all this to life for us. It is...Star Wars.",1

7723,8.0,"Going into this movie my expectations were low. All the reviews I had seen for this movie had all but killed my hopes for this last instalment of the Star Wars saga, however, what I got to see in the theatre was completely amazing. A thrilling end to the adventure, 42 years in the making, this is what all the anticipation led to. J J Abraham has created a masterpiece which pulls in the new audience while rewarding the existing one, but this movie was something that I did not anticipate. I fully expected it to get the Endgame treatment- Playing it safe and giving the fans exactly what they ask for. However, those are not the groundbreaking movies, the ones that are remembered are the ones which break the mould and do something new, even in the face of all the flak received by the community. The ending was satisfying, yet unpredictable, controversial but the perfect one a fan like me could hope for. After seeing all the movies multiple times along with watching all the tv series of this saga, I have come to conclude that this movie carries a deep mix of emotions and nostalgia, so be advised this movie is in no way made for critics or casual viewers, it is a celebration of all things Star Wars, a salute, rather a gift if you may, to all the hardcore fans that remember the callbacks and parallels to the original trilogy, to those who look out for the minute details. The movie is the most fitting end, though the movie in itself isn't perfect. It has its flaws- the first half was a bit clumsy and it lowered the value of the films that came before it, making sacrifices like that of Anakin devoid and contradicting the prophecy if him being the chosen one. The best thing about this movie was that no glasses were left half full, everyone got the best possible arc they could have got and It gave us closure on all of their fates, which were as good as anything we could've asked for. A tearful end to almost half a century of lore building, the last of the Skywalker Saga.",1
7724,6.0,"This movie is the worst from entire star wars serie. They breaked entire universe star wars, the movies beyond 2000 were better. If you take from movie the sound and special effects, this movie is 0. It has a nice start with episode 7 but they didn't keep next movies on same level. Totally dissapointed.",0
7725,8.0,"I have been a star wars fan since the early 90s when I was born. And apparently I'm a rare fan where I enjoy all of the movies and tv shows. Dont understand why this amazing film is getting so much hate. Sure it isnt lucas vision but its damn near perfect in my opinion. It's got everything true star wars fans love in one film.<br /><br />Completely course correcting the last jedi was absolutely necessary after that film left so many unanswered questions.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier to have the skywalker saga conclude on such a high note, and so much hope for the future of the franchise now.

Loved Rogue one, I thought it was true to episode IV and as usual I went into this one with a lot of trepidation, expecting the worst. I really didn't dislike it as much as I thought, the Palpatine plot was very thin, but some aspects of it were entertaining. Personally I can understand why many don't like it, but as a Star Wars fan I think the only way it can be watchable is if you take your fan hat off and try and watch it on it's merits of one film. Hopefully Disney are done picking our pockets, but whilst mugs like me continue to pay to watch in Cinemas i guess we get what we deserve.",1

Movie was fast paced, entertaining full of Easter eggs and little jokes, it tied some loose ends from the last couple of movies and we all enjoyed it (the gang I went to see it with). Thanks JJ. I will be seeing it again.",1
7729,6.0,"It's the end of a trilogy but it feels like this movie should restart it all and begin from here.

I found the first half of the movie to be a bit too packed for my own liking, but the second half was a massive payoff. There were some things that left me scratching my head, but nothing was so bad that it ruined the movie for me. At the end of the day it was an enjoyable film, and if you head into the theater without a vendetta against the new trilogy, then the film is entirely enjoyable.",0

7738,9.0,"I went it into the movie with out any preconceived notions of whether it was great or terrible. Instead I let the story dictate that. The story was a bit fast paced, but there was a lot that needed to be told and a lot of loose ends that needed to be tied up. There were several instances I was surprised that the writers thought to tie the movie to the original trilogy. I mean some I knew from the trailers, but I was surprised by others.",0
7739,9.0,"The best movie from the Disney trilogy and the best way to end this trilogy. Not the best movie to end the whole saga but who cares, it's a rollercoaster of fun and nostalgia. Don't believe the critics, go watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",1
7740,7.0,"11 years. I've waited 11 years for the culmination of everything star wars to come to a head. I sat through countless hours of the tv shows, the movies, even some of the lore. Yet here I sit, 1 hour after the movie, still pondering how much of a disaster this franchise has ultimately become. To be completely honest, I registered an IMDb account just to voice how disgusted I am with this film. Don't misinterpret what I'm saying here -Star Wars has good bones- but even that's not enough to save it from the corporate think tank. Episode 9 is a disappoint debacle of what could have been. Throughout the movie, the viewer consistently is blindsided by new force powers and new backstory. For heavens sake, this is the final movie in the main franchise, how much more expository dialogue and retconning to we need? It is understandable that episode 8 didn't sit well with Star Wars fans, young and old, but at what point do we draw the line between fan service and an actual movie that wraps up 8 others? HOWEVER, what I will give this movie is the fantastic cinematography. The way the movie is shot, on top of the diverse color palette, tremendously increases pull of the entire film.",0
7741,9.0,"Still some cheesy Disney-esque moments but I really loved all the touches of nostalgia to wrap up the saga. The treatment and use of Carrie Fisher was beautifully done and a fitting end for her. After The Last Jedi, which I'd rate a 4, I was skeptical about this. I left very happy and felt it ended the story in a satisfying way",1
7742,4.0,"It was a good film, entertaining, and fun. No, it wasn't great or cerebral, but we all know that's not what big studio filmmakers these days are going for.",1
7743,8.0,"I will first say about the good part: if you just want to watch a ""star wars"" movie with action and cool CGI and dont care much about the story development or about the star wars universe, then I had say watch it. But otherwise the whole trilogy is a garbage:",0
7744,7.0,From all the Star Wars movies this is by far the worst.,0
7745,3.0,"There is nothing better than a good ending! This movie has it. I was very satisfied. It felt like the ending that star wars needed. The movie had lot's of elements from the orignal trilogy and the prequel trilogy. But was also very unique en has it's own story.<br /><br />I am very content what they did with the characters. I thought was never going to get used to the characters from the sequel trilogy. This movie had changed my mind about the characters a lot. The new characters were never that interesting as the old characters. This movie changed my mind. I think Rey, Finn and Poe have finally earned their status as legendary star wars characters and i definitely want to see more of them in a series or new trilogy.<br /><br />The visual effects and music were fantastic like every star wars movie.<br /><br />I like what they done and i'm sad that it's already over. But i will always carry this trilogy in my heart just like the original and prequel trilogy. I think disney has done at good job en learned from their mistakes. It's not easy to make a star wars movie because of the very critical fandom. But i think they did just fine!",1
7746,3.0,"This is an example of what happens when a middle movie gets completely mis-managed. Abrams has to spend 2/3 of this movie dealing with who Rey is again. In EP7 it was hinted she was something more, then Rian Johnson decided she was a nobody, and then Abrams basically says but she is because I wanted her to be from the first place. This movie was behind the 8 ball from the start leading to a feeling of the movie being rushed and no explanation of some important plot points. For example, I still don't know how Palpatine survived they elude to cloning but his hands and body are all sorts of jacked up so that tells me the guy we see is the one who is thrown down the shaft in the OG trilogy. At one point in the movie Finn says he has something to tell Rey... then he never says in the movie what he was going to tell Rey! There's more points, but it's not worth getting to in the weeds. I honestly feel this movie's issues were created by the massive failures of EP8 than just bad story writing it was too much movie shoved in to the time frame.",0
7747,9.0,"This movie is such a good time. So much for everyone in all parts of the fanbase. Great Visuals, Fights, and an overall pretty good story. Highly recommend! My only gripe with the movie is the pacing in the first half but other than that it was great!",1
7748,7.0,I wouldn't believe the 1 ratings that this movie has gotten from fellow imdb members. It's way better than that. In my opinion it's a solid 8 out of 10. It's very enjoyable and the feel of this movie is reminiscent of the old Star Wars movies. I went in to the theatre expecting a mess but came out with utter satisfaction and a big smile on my face. Go and see it. It's worth it.,1
7749,7.0,"JJ Abrams went into this film with the fallout of a fanbase that fell out of love with the franchise over the last jedi. The unfortunate passing of Carrie fisher ment he had limited resources to give Leia a fitting story arc and send off. And still had to find a way to end the Skywalker story once and for all.......<br /><br />After watching the film I can agree it wasn't the greatest star wars film of all time, but it certainly wasn't the worst.<br /><br />The film was fun to watch and had plenty of wow factor moments from the opening sequence to the closing moments of the film.<br /><br />Many subtle nods to its predecessors (episodes 1-6)<br /><br />And a fantastic last film for carrie. a good strong end to the saga maby not the way people expected ,but the star wars fan base needs to wake up and smell the coffee that the original 3 films (4-6) are classics but they were there own story and this is another well done JJ you did a job I couldn't !!",1
7750,8.0,"This movie was very emotional, funny, fun, and all around a good movie. The story worked well at answering everything and tying everything together with the rest of the saga.<br /><br />People just expect perfection, but even if it came their way I believe that they would still hate it. Some people just hate it just to prove that they are fans of Star Wars and they don't want anything new.",1
7751,8.0,I went to see this film last night and I thought It was very good.,1
7752,9.0,This was an excellent way to tie up the end of the series.,1
7753,8.0,The best possible ending to a fairy tale.<br /><br />it is entertaining fan service with beautiful emotional moments.,1
7754,9.0,"I went into the movie not knowing what to expect. I had a completely open mind about it. I think it was okay, but still weaker than previous movies. I feel like the character development of Kylo Ren was what disappointed me the most as well as the fact I personally feel Rey had too much power. It just doesn't make sense to me how she would be able to defeat the whole First Order and Palpatine by herself with such little training (that we know of) when people such as Luke couldn't do it before. It wasn't a big let down, but I feel like it had more potential as a movie. I encourage you to see it yourself and formulate your own opinion.",1
7755,5.0,"I went into this with apprehension, as I had not been a fan of JJ's previous work. I felt like The Last Jedi made a blank slate for this movie though and even a bad Star Wars movie is still better than a lot of stuff out there, so I went.",0
7756,7.0,I really loved this movie. J.J.Abrams did a great job of making sense of the mess other directors made with the story line in previous episodes. The pace was perfect and it was great seeing all of the actors from the earlier episodes.,1
7757,10.0,"Don't listen to the reviews, The Rise of Skywalker featured some amazing fight scenes, character development(specifically from Adam Driver's character Ben Solo), and a final fight scene that brings together the whole saga from prequels to sequels.",1
7758,9.0,There are many people keep saying the story is bad and how better were the old movies. I think this is not true. The original movies had so simple story - those are the bad guys and those are the good guys and we all enjoyed the amazing worlds and Jedi/Sith.,1
7759,8.0,"As an honest Star Wars fan, I was worried about the path the trilogy took after Episode 8. It was full of crappy propaganda yet it was a little bit more understandable.",1
7760,9.0,"First off, to get this out of the way: The movie is nonsense, the characters almost all fall flat, and the story is just one stupid MacGuffin + fan service after another. It's clear to anyone going in somewhat objectively that there was no real plan or vision for this trilogy, and that it was a great disservice to the Star Wars franchise as a whole.",0
7761,1.0,"While not perfect this movie, this was the best case scenario given the dumpster fire of episode 8. Don't like the new trilogy? Place the blame where it belongs, with Rian Johnson for poor writting and Disney for not having a cohesive vision for the trilogy. I don't know why Star Wars fans hate Star Wars. They should all know that hate leads to suffering and suffer leads to bad reviews .",1
7762,4.0,"It's a flawed movie but it left me satisfied. I watched it twice already. If you didn't like TFA you are not gong to like this one, and I can understand that. But if you enjoyed Episode VII, give this one a try, you may get pleasantly surprised.",1
7763,8.0,"Man I'm not even understanding the negative reviews on people... My God you are passionate about Sci-Fi cinema, you want everything to be perfect and that it fits perfectly with the long romanticized original trilogy.",1
7764,8.0,First off this is my opinion so dont leave any hate... The Rise of Skywalker was a jumbled up ending to the skywalker saga but the first half of the movie didnt feel in place and not right for the 3rd installment in the trilogy! Not going to lie I loved the 3rd act but just think that the beginning could have been stretched into the last jedi and this movie could be condensed to the 3rd act only with extended scenes ! The nostalgia factor of the end really hit me hard growing up with star wars (prequels) .Again this is my opinion and I want to hear your thoughts about it !,1
7765,8.0,Rise of Skywalker was a good movie. Definitely doesn't deserve the hate it is getting.It's not perfect but it was good,1
7766,7.0,"Sorry..I can't help it, sleep 3 times during the movie, its like lost the soul of star wars and more like family movie, well just my opinion",0
7767,10.0,"Forget the bad reviews here, watch the movie for yourself. In my opinion, it was a great film and touched on all the important story arcs.",1
7768,6.0,"Go see it. Make up your own mind. Ignore the negativity. Outrage culture is in full effect. The movie was entertaining, action packed, closed many loose ends (not all), it was classy, had fun humor, and I can't wait to see it again! People will always have a complaint, but they wouldn't a have a clue on how to direct/ screen-write/ produce a movie of this magnitude. The happiest people are the ones who are most grateful. Disappointment come from let down expectations. The movie is fiction, a.k.a the creators have free reign to make up whatever they want, therefore who are these people saying certain things aren't possible. Give me a break. Enjoy the movie like the majority of Star Wars fan.",0
7769,8.0,"I am not one to usually write a review of a movie or TV show but I wanted to express my option on The Rise of Skywalker and the sequel trilogy in general. A lot of people are comparing it to the original, which is ok if you do that. I want to compare it as a completion of the last 3 movies, not as an overall.",0
7770,10.0,"The film was not that bad as I though after reading the reviews. Yes, there were some non-senses, but...",0
7771,8.0,"For me the film was a very good one in regard of entertainment, visual and audio effects and that are the reasons, why I'm going to the movies - period.<br /><br />I feel really sorry for all those people, which are filled with hate or similar feelings and they couldn't enjoy the movie as a consequence. I think they don't know how bad they are doing with themselves, if they follwing such a path. But why should I care...<br /><br />I'm just sad, that this witch hunt is running since the prequels went alive and has been even more forced with the sequels.",0
7772,8.0,"It's a movie that is what is a child of the last. Is it a great Star Wars movie? No. Is it a great popcirn movie, yes. Of course. Are some fams going to like it? The true ones will. It basically has stuff from the comics, paperbacks, and videogames. It requires us to have an open mind, which many hardcore fans and critics certainly will not have. You gotta decide for yourself. You won't hate it, but you will notice flaws. Look, the Russo Bros. didn't write nor film this movie. Accept it.",1
7773,8.0,A fantastic conclusion to 40 years of storytelling!,1
7774,7.0,"First, obviously the movie team once again outdone itself in special effects, creating fascinating landscapes and great fighting scenes. This is especially cool to watch in a cinema, enabling the viewer to be completely immersed in the Star Wars world for 2 hours. Great job!",1
7775,10.0,"It's hard to discern what to expect when wading through page after page of reviews by whining man-babies. That goes for *a lot* of reviews on here.<br /><br />The film manages to do what it sets out to do: Provide an emotionally satisfying conclusion to a 9 film cycle.<br /><br />For my money, JJ delivered. There are flaws and missed opportunities, but I don't see how pushing this or that agenda *in this film* would have helped bring the saga to an end.<br /><br />Having said that, I hope the philosophical loose ends can be picked up in any future films (which there will be, mark my words)",1
7776,5.0,The movie has a lot of issues but it's still enjoyable. It's very fanservicy and a lot of things that happened in the previous two movies did not matter but they tried giving us a decent ending to the trilogy. The highlight of the movie was once again Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) who gave a great performance.,1
7777,8.0,Great end to Skywalker saga and a must see movie if you love starwars,1
7778,8.0,An epic ending of a saga about adults fighting for custody of an orphan.,0
7779,10.0,"Bottom line, when I left last Jedi the literal first words out of my mouth were ""Was Rian making fun of us Star Wars fans?""",1
7780,8.0,"Just so you know this review is coming from a star wars fan not a die hard fan but thats due to the horrible direction it has gone under disneys control.<br /><br />This film as a stand alone title is okay and i would have given it a 5 star posibbly even a 6 star rating. Yet the first hour of the film is still a chore to get through and even as i write this revenge of the sith is playing in the background which is far more entertaining than the rise of skywalker.<br /><br />I grew up on the god awful prequels so i respect them for their visuals and choreography even if it it was terribly written, i have to say this film single handedly ruins the rewatch value of every star wars film. Anakin turned to the dark side to try find a cure to death even though there isnt one to just have ren bring rey back to life are you serious??? The force once again allows them to do things never stated before and to bring back palpatine in this why felt cheap and unoriginal. Speaking of originality i just want to point out all three remakes lacked any originallity that even the prequeals had.<br /><br />The reason the film felt okay as a stand qlone was due to the team actually being together more with poe and fin having some really good chemistry but oh dear lord rey annoys the hell out of me. Her behavoiur in the film is understandable but i dont believe the actor is any good. On the other note Kylo Ren had one if the best story arcs in my opnion, i hated him in force awakens but he came back for a third time and made me love him.<br /><br />I loved the star wars universe but after this film i wont to clean my hands of it all and its a shame disney have to stick their noses into everything for a bit of profit because its slowly ruining the industry. And for me its ruined this fantastic series.",0
7781,10.0,"Why not just stick your hand out and throw one planet into another and be done with it? Why bother with light swords and x-ray guns?

Long way from pulling a lightsaber out of the snow.",0
7782,3.0,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and i love it. I can understand why people not happy with it and the first 15 minutes I was confused but after that it made sense. If you saw episode 8 and going by that then yeah you would be confused. You need to keep an open mind because see there are Differences in these three Star Wars film, episode 7, 8 and 9. You should watch it",0
7783,3.0,"Didn't have high expectations because of reviews. I'm glad I didn't listen to any of them. 9 was a billion times better than 8 just as good as 7. This is how all the Starwars movies should of been made. J. J. Abrams is amazing. I grew up with Starwars had a million toys, still have them. Don't listen to bad reviews, go see this movie. Absolutely amazing.",1
7784,10.0,"There were a few things to criticize about The Last Jedi, the main 1 being making Luke bitter and killing him off. So first Han, now Luke? Prop up the stars of the new trilogy by killing the stars of the first one? Really?",0

7788,9.0,"Took some hints from Disney and then had moments that made me crap, (from pure genius) definitely is worth the watch but, still the movie ""which doesn't step on any toes""",1
7789,3.0,"Star Wars the rise of skywalker was an okay Star Wars movie it wasn't the worse Star Wars movie like Attack of the Clones but it was a disappointment.<br /><br />Pros: The acting was amazing everyone did the best they could with what they were given. Adam Driver and Oscar Issac were the best part of the movies especially Adam Driver. The soundtrack by John Williams was phenomenal and nostalgic. The way Carrie Fishers character Princess Leia was handled as best as possible in light of Carrie Fishers death. Most of the action scene were venir very well especially Kylo Ren v. Rey on the water planet.<br /><br />Cons: Not acknowledging The Last Jedi. Reys lineage and that she's related to the Emperor. Knights of Ren were wack. Most of the new side characters advertise were pretty useless. Movie felt like Jedi Fallen Order a lot of fetch quests. Opening crawl was very underwhelming with the the first 40 mins being very exposition heavy. It felt like it was 3 movies in one The Last Jedi remake, Star Trek Into Darkness, and Colin Trevorrow's movie.<br /><br />Overall the movie was okay I liked a lot of parts especially when Ben Solo turns good I feel that J. J. Abrams did the best he could with the time he was given but the movie should've been delayed one year and he should've stuck with what was setup in The Last Jedi. In conclusion this is just my opinion of how I felt about the film go watch the film.",0
7790,7.0,I tried to keep an open mind going into this movie and I'm glad I did!,1
7791,7.0,I enjoyed the little throwbacks to all of the movies. People are going to complain. I do believe if Last Jedi hadn't gone the direction it did. then there could have been a some what different outcome. Is this a perfect movie no. But if you want to enjoy something for a few hours and feel some nostalgia then watch.,1
7792,9.0,"Nothing much to say, just an idiotic movies with almost nothing positive at all",0
7793,7.0,"Please don't get influenced by the many horrible reviews, I my self went into the movie with mixed feelings but I never red any spoilers and leaks before I went to see it, so I was very surprised, sure some things leave you a little doubtful because it's just such a coincidence but it's always like this in the Star Wars movies. I mean remember the original movies, Luke is Leias sister and darth Vader is the father of them... it's always like this so you shouldn't be disappointed when the new movies also have similar relationships between the characters.<br /><br />I really loved the movie, especially the second half. The ending was bitter sweet and I even cried a little bit so everyone who says that you don't care about the characters when you watch the movie is wrong.<br /><br />Go watch it, and please don't overanalyse everything, that could ruin the movie for you. Not everything has to make perfect sense, every single movie ever made has a few plot holes. Adam Driver was in my opinion the best actor in this movie and his character development is so touching, it you don't feel anything while watching I don't know what's wrong with you ...",1
7794,4.0,This was a GREAT movie!!! I had heard all of the criticism and was bracing for this crappy thing. To my surprise it was another wonderful Star Wars experience!!! I'm going back as soon as I can!!! It was no different than Return of the Jedi that left us with many questions that led to a ton of books and Star Wars Canon that have been trying to fill holes since the 80's.,1
7795,9.0,"The last installment of the Skywalker saga was great. I think they did a good job wrapping it up considering they really had no planned direction for these sequels. The acting was great, the fights were great and we get to see some awesome new environments and new worlds. While I agree that the overall sequel storyline was way too much like the original, these movies are far better in every aspect to the prequels. Really. Go back and watch them. I give it an A-.",1

7798,8.0,"Finally went to see IX: Rise of Skywalker, and it was a GREAT ending to the Star Wars saga. I couldn't help but cry throughout the movie, knowing it was the end of a story that has perpetuated through my 42 years. I'm a girl, so if course, I cried throughout the movie. LOL Overall, I think it was really well made, and wrapped up the Skywalker saga with a nice little bow. JJ Abrams did well in bringing this story to an end. I don't think we've seen the last of the galaxy they Lucas created, but this is the end of the Skywalker storyline.",1
7799,10.0,"There are a lot of problems with this film, we have had 2 movies to develop the main characters, and just one of them could finished his act, that's Kylo Ren, by far, the best character in this new trilogy.

7800,9.0,The puppets were six stars. I just thought I'd say that. Maybe some Hollywood type will see this and give us more puppets.,0
7801,,I hope that in time - with distance from our own childhood experiences with Star Wars - viewers can learn to appreciate this saga with a fresh eyes. It's not what you pretended it to be. And it probably did itself a great disservice by allowing so much sanctioned fan-fiction to be created outside the films.,1
7802,6.0,"I saw a ranking of star wars movies and when I saw that this movie was ranked lower than the garbage that was the prequels, I felt compelled to write this. Rise of Skywalker was an amazing movie. The people nitpicking every detail just don't understand what star wars is all about. All of the awesome emotions one should feel from watching an exciting movie were there. It's not as good as the original trilogy or the force awakens, but if you gave this movie a 1 out of 10, please never post anything ever again.",1
7803,9.0,"TLJ is garbage and an insult to the saga, and Skywalker's legacy.",0

7805,9.0,"I don't know what the naysayers wanted from the movie. It had great visuals, impeccable score, and fleshed out a lot of the main character stories. Why do reviewers have a problem with Rey being powerful? Or not having done enough training? She trained at least as much as Luke did in the original trilogy.<br /><br />One reviewer even complained that the movie messes up Anakin's story. Anakin's story ended in episode VI.",0
7806,10.0,"I have come to the conclusion that you can never please Star Wars fans anymore. I have been a fan of this franchise since I was 2 years old. Granted there are episodes I prefer over others, but if I can go to the theatre, be entertained and have a good time. Then it's a success. There is never a perfect movie. Just appreciate the hard work everyone has done on the movie and just sit back and watch. If you didn't like it that's fine. But others might disagree. Okay it's not a perfect movie, but I had a great Thursday night watching. Bring balance back to the movie going experience, no one is right or wrong.",1
7807,9.0,This movie picks up as if it should have if JJ stayed for episode 8 but as a conclusion to the series it blew my expectations. A ride full of the twists and turns you expect to see in a Star Wars movie with the heart to keep you on the edge of your seat. Forget the pen holders who are paid to hate and focus on the fans who the true service was delivered in this instance. It was a redemption on past endeavours by Disney however lacked the establishment for the expanded universe. There is so much more to tell in this universe and I hope that the characters that have been established still have a part to play in those stories.,1
7808,7.0,I just can't understand why so much hate. I just loved every second of it and gave a great conclusion to the whole saga. Even entertained some of the Lucas' prequel ideas.,1

The CGI was incredible and the fight scenes especially at the end were great.",1

7818,6.0,"I don't understand why so many people are giving this 1/10. It's not complete garbage and it's not a masterpiece. I didn't grow up with the original trilogy, so maybe I'm not completely trustworthy, but I really enjoyed this movie. Sure there was a lot of fan service, and maybe it was predictable at many points, but I think it was a good ending to the story of the Skywalkers. Also, no this is not the end of the Star Wars movies, the president of Lucasfilm said it herself. They are going to be moving away from the story of the Skywalker family and are going to go into a new story. They are also moving away from the trilogy model for the movies. You should go into movies with an open mind instead of focusing on every flaw in the movie. No movie will ever please you if you watch a movie like that.",1
7819,9.0,I personally enjoyed the pace and the visuals of the film. The Story still sucks but this Is the best Disney episode so far.,1
7820,8.0,"Although it feels like JJ tried to cram two movies in one, with horrible pacing in the first act, and a general lack of bold story decisions, it manages to hit all the right beats for a fun romp, full of cameos and references to it's past.",0
7821,8.0,"Pierre Leclerc I am pretty sure that if A New Hope came out today, the same so called fans/ Haters would dissect every scene and find a million things wrong with the movie, the plot, the writing, the special effects... The problem now is that many people are watching these fan theories on YouTube and have preconceived ideas and high expectations of what the movies should be, then the movie comes out and nothing from the fan theories are in the movies and the viewers are ultimately disappointed. Everybody is an expert critics with very strong opinions and anybody not thinking like they do is an idiot or this or that. Do people actually enjoy going to the cinema anymore? I Saw The Rise of Skywalker for a second time and really enjoyed the movie. I am easily amused and love going to the cinema. Just go see the movie get a $12 popcorn and enjoy! :)",1

7825,6.0,"Instead of writing a movie review per se, and having read all the hatred disguised as movie reviews here, I decided to write a simple guide on enjoying not only Star Wars, but absolutely any movie at all. That said, whenever a sequel of a legendary franchise such as Star Wars comes out, there are two things I usually do. 1. I do not open my IMDB app or visit any website containing movie ""reviews"" in order to completely ignore the usual hatred that befalls an all-time favorite flick. 2. I avoid those meme-based apps which are rife with spoilers at all cost. Unfortunately, when it comes to Star Wars, some ""fans"" act as extreme traditionalists who will never accept Disney Studios as the legitimate owner of Star Wars and to them, it doesn't really matter if they come with an epic flick. They will always wear their keyboard warrior armour and loathe it at all costs. Such people would rather see Star Wars being written with the same Apple 1 computer George Lucas used when writing the script for Star Wars: A New Hope back in 77. Hell, they probably resent the fact that 35 mm PANAVISION cameras weren't used in episode IX. I like to compare what's been happening to Star Wars to what's been happening to Formula 1. There's this group of people who call themselves ""fans"" who insist on ignoring the fact that Liberty Media has been gathering more F1 fans around the world by making this motorsport more enjoyable too by introducing ""modern"" entertainment such as a T-shirt gun/launcher and Bruno Mars concerts on race weekends. Despite the fact that I hate Bruno Mars (or that type of music), it is undeniable that F1 has got itself into a more modern, sophisticated Era, just like Star Wars. There are legions, believe it or not, who stopped following F1 because those extreme fuel-efficient, lower-emission Power Units are being used instead of gas-guzzling, oil-spilling V10s from the 80s. Believe it or not, there are legions who stopped following the Star Wars franchise because Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren aren't like Luke, Leia, Han and Vader. So, what are you waiting for? Go and enjoy another excellent Star Wars installment if you can ignore the bad ""reviews"" in here. And if you, like me, grew up watching A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, don't forget to bring your tissues (yes, there will be crying in the theater, I guarantee it).",0
7826,8.0,It's a solid movie from start to finish. JJ Abrams is a mastermind.,0
7827,9.0,"A beautiful movie made for the real fans, if you see it with eyes of a kid, you will love it, it's a beautiful movie",1
7828,10.0,"The buthurt from fanboys around the globe is in full swing. People are disliking this movie for the sake of it or because TLJ still erks them. Did I like TLJ? Yes, but there are parts that annoy me and I don't agree with ,in my opinion Luke wouldn't never of abandoned his friends like that, and Admiral Akbar ( a much loved character) would of been a much better choice to pull the Akbar manoeuvre and sacrifice himself instead of some unknown Holdor. Having said that there are small parts of all the SW movies that I don't like. Chewy never receiving a medal. Stormtroopers can't shoot for s*#t, that love dialogue in AOTC, the lack of fight between 4 Jedi masters/knights and Sidious in ROTS, the Empires in-ability to prevent an attack on the 2nd Death Star by not protecting the openings in ROTJ.<br /><br />Now onto TROS, a great SW movie that ties up the new trilogy nicely and answer many questions that we all had (how Maz got Luke's sabre from cloud city is still a mystery). Great acting by Daisy and co. I really enjoyed the arc and subsequent redemption of Kylo. The pace was nice with little down time and no flat spots. The scenery was epic on Passana and Exegol. The fight scenes were nicely choreographed and visually stunning. The cameo at the end battle had me leaping out of my seat (wish there was more of him though). The ending was moving and leaving me wanting more. I really enjoyed this as it was me at to be enjoyed, through the eyes of lifelong fan. I will be definitely be seeing this more than once at the cinema. Thank you JJ ( and Rian) for a great new trilogy.",1
7829,9.0,"Nice Job, especially with all the pressure! I thought it was done very well.",1
7830,10.0,"These movies are horrible but Hollywood will never stop making because it's like the second most profitable movie series of all time. The acting is wooden, the script feels very rushed( there are horses in space) and the directing is horrible as usual with Abrams. I recommend just watching the first three because the sequels are laughable and dumb.",0
7831,9.0,"For me an awesome experience. I cant grasp how anyone could give this 5 or fewer points unless they had already made their judgments before seeing this movie or trying to let go of their own prejudices about this saga. This film (maybe even the whole last trilogy) may have been better, but I am glad I have lived to see it. It makes me really sad how judgmental and biased people can get, let alone in the most unforgiving and cruel way.<br /><br />Given all the circumstance and super-over-hyped expectations, they have done enough toho make it work.<br /><br />Please, do not allow a repeat of episode 1 and 2 thrashing, none of the films deserve that.<br /><br />Daisy and Adam are brutally excellent!",1
7832,6.0,"Maybe I had low expectations because of all the bad reviews, but I thought it was one of the best Star Wars movies. With the caveat that I like Star Wars but am not a super fan.",0
7833,10.0,"In addition to the fact that the last three episodes do not have absolutely no logic and plot, we observe a sad picture of how female characters use unusual manners and behavior. In all the new episodes, the generals are women, the most powerful and staunch warriors are women. At the same time, men are represented by weak and sobbing. It only causes disgust.",0
7834,10.0,"The Rise of Skywalker does not match the magic and freshness of A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back. Then again, I am not sure it is possible for any movie to live up to those two episodes.",1
7835,,"Actual 7 out of 10 for me, it's an enjoyable star wars film, and it wraps things up pretty well. Cinematography, music, acting, and visuals were all top notch. It's the safest star wars has ever been and that's not the worst thing for it to be.",1
7836,8.0,"I was really looking forward to this movie when it first hit theaters. because I hoped everything would work out around who Rey was and who her parents were. I also wanted to find out who snoke was and who the knights of ren actually are. We also received those answers, but how?",0
7837,5.0,"Recalled many moments throughout the series. I loved this movie. Wasn't perfect, but still incredible.",1
7838,3.0,"I was hoping this would be a great movie, but it turned out to be quite generic. It gave lame excuses to bring Palpatine back for example. And the ""Rey Skywalker"" is a little bit forced to me. I still enjoy the movie.",0
7839,9.0,Enjoyed this episode. loved the mix of old and new characters. only gripe was the repeated drawn out battles between rey and ren,1
7840,7.0,"A bit of background. I was 11 years old when I saw A New Hope III and I've been a fan ever since, until now that is. My dilemma is should I even watch the last episode of my favourite movie franchise ever, or not? I might be better off not inflicting further injury to that glow of fond Star Wars memories by avoiding watching this movie. What you all think?",1
7841,10.0,Ben and Rey kissing on the mouth is all I really wanted in the end. Could've been a clear 10/10 if they made a better story around the smooching.,0
7842,6.0,The film is on the right path for the Star Wars saga but falls a little short.,0
7843,6.0,Just a bad movie. The music doesn't fit and the plot is just weird. And the end battle makes no sense at all and cause the Resistance know things they shouldn't know. Bad puns and boring script. And Rey has become to OP.,0
7844,6.0,"First of all, I understand why people do not like this movie. Personally, I do and I praise all the decisions JJ made. I have got so much answers from this movie, which I did not get from The Last Jedi... I just cannot complain. Yes, I raised my eyes when I learned Rey's background, but come on. It is something that can be explained later on, in TV shows or comics, etc. Just as Anakin was a Sith with a love interest, could Palpatine have been the same. Or a Sith with just a naughty moment. And yes Rey easily defeated him but so did Vader. That is why I will not judge that scene.<br /><br />So, to sum it up; the reasons I liked this movie are; most of the mess has been cleaned up, got all the cameos I expected, the ending and the fact that there is no irrelevant moment in this movie (plus there numerous potentials for comics and tv series such as Luke and Lando's quest, Leia's training, etc.) Gave it just 9 points because f the plot hole for most of the people; how Rey and Palpatine could be related? As you have read it, I have some ideas but I expect answers from Lucasfilm in the future.",0
7845,2.0,"The Force Awakens was well executed, fairly predictable but a good watching experience despite that.",1
7846,9.0,I must say that I have been disappointed by the sequels like many Star Wars fans but decided to give this film a chance and came in with no expectations. I was blown away and thoroughly enjoyed the movie and thought is revived the sequel trilogy. Let me explain.,0
7847,1.0,...but if you are looking for a SCIENCE FICTION plot line to finalize a story never meant to be explained you will be disappointed.,0
7848,10.0,"About 2 months later, I still have bad taste in my mouth. Rewatching the previous 8 movies make me feel how bad is that one. There was a lot of good ideas in this movie but they are for most of them wasted.",0
7849,7.0,"If I had listened to those suggesting to skip this movie it would be regretful. I am not a fanboy but I like the franchise. So for me it was entertaining the whole 2+ hours it lasted. I find it to be a solid 8. I dont think she is Mary Sue and find her quite pretty, there is clever talk when Finn says ""are you ready back there"" the answer is even better. And I deeply appreciate that they did not go too much into politically correct stuff. 2 mild kisses in the whole movie is something to thank for. A perfectly good end that leaves warmth in me. It is epic, has good FXs according to the industry standard for 2019. As I said, it is perfectly fine.",1
7850,3.0,I hated The Last Jedi - This movie is not that movie.,0
7851,8.0,"Feel like the sequel trilogy undermines Anakin's arc and a lot of decision in TROS weren't very good. It also jumped from place to place all the time, and we didn't learn how Palpatine survived & he died again quite easily... Just by Rey, which was quite lame. Anakin Skywalker not visually appearing either and just a few voice lines was a big disappointment.",0
7852,9.0,"I went into the theater (a week after it open) knowing there were some haters and some lovers. I must admit I was really looking forward to seeing it. I am a Star Wars fan, but not a mega fan. I've seen all the movies, but don't read the books or such. I saw the Star Wars A New Hope at the drive-in when I was seven. I still have the imagine of looking through the car windows and seeing the Death Star blowing up, and remember the exhilaration I felt at the time.",1
7853,7.0,"I never reviewed any of the SW Movies, because that I doesn't wanted to connect these wonderful sci-fi drama series to any ""Star"" Rating! It doesn't feel right to connect something that always been in your life and you always loved to just a rating (good or bad)",1
7854,7.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rise of Skywalker, much more than I expected to. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, it ticked every box. Excellent characterizations, superbly directed, wonderful spfx, and very respectful to the Star Wars legend. It was dark, thrilling, funny, moving, hopeful, with a satisfying send off for Leia and a fitting finale.",1
7855,7.0,"I found the film very fitting as the end of the saga.<br /><br />It integrates the previous actions and characters in a good way. Therefore The Rise of Skywalker imo is clearly the best film of the Sequels, because it lives from a lot of nostalgia, but in contrast to Ep. 7, refreshes with something new. The problem of the Disney triology is much more likely to be episode 8, because, unlike episode 9, it doesn't really fit the first 7 movies.",1
7856,8.0,"... fun to watch for the pew pew pew etc... but when you get to the point where a boarding party lands on a star destroyer and charges on horseback ... well... its like them ramming their hand with the middle finger up into your fave and shouting ""that's right, its about the money and you paid for this junk.... SUCKER !",0
7857,8.0,All I can thought was Confusion when I sit in the camera.,0
7858,3.0,"This was a great movie, excellent closure to the modern trilogy. If you are disappointed, please share your wisdom and convince us how you would make this movie a 10",1
7859,8.0,"Overall I really enjoyed TRoS, it's not as meaningful or as nicely shot as TLJ but honestly it was just really fun, there were a few plot elements I wasn't a fan of like rey's origin or the explanation of snoke but the positives far outweighed the negatives IMO",1
7860,9.0,Redemption this movie redeemed everything from the last Jedi so we'll that it didn't feel forced and flowed naturally. This movie kept me on the edge of the seat and never had a dull moment. Definitely go see this movie if you are a true Star Wars fan from the callbacks to the strong story a true Star Wars movie for the fans without flaws!,1
7861,9.0,Abrams had a difficult job- finishing a 9 film series that most everyone everywhere has an opinion about.,1
7862,10.0,"A lot of these 1-3 star reviews are a little exaggerated in my opinion. I enjoyed the movie! Sure there were some cheesy parts and it felt like a lot of twists crammed into one film, but it was still enjoyable to watch.",1
7863,9.0,"First movie has a good story and because of this every fan has a great expectation, but second and third movie just a member of star wars thing it isnt special and no one wants to watch again.",1
7864,7.0,"Overall, would consider it a good movie. My biggest complaint is that it was a bit rushed, as they were trying to tie up all lose ends. There were some cheesy lines, but what else do you expect from Disney. A little predictable, but not as predictable as episode 7 & 8. Visually a really good movie with lots of cool action packed scenes. Other than a few things here and there to nit pick, overall would recommend seeing it.",1
7865,7.0,"There's something for everyone, no matter what movie you consider your favorite, you're bound to find a few cheeky nods to it in this one!",1
7866,7.0,"Aside that I am big SW fan, I would rather pay to watch this movie over and over instead of watching Marvels crap.",0
7867,9.0,"Dramatic light saber duals, space battles, weird creatures, light/dark, force abilities, nostalgia and a lot more in between. As someone who has grown up with Star Wars for the last 42 of my 49 years, I'm not sure how else this could have been done. Well done JJ, I think you did the saga justice.",1
7868,8.0,"Loved the line to dis Johnson's opening scene in TLJ. Bravo JJ!<br /><br />The Skywalker story is complete.<br /><br />Guys, it's meant to hit all demographics, get a grip.<br /><br />The 8 year old near me loved it. The 1e year ood on ky otyer side cheered. I clapped numerous times.<br /><br />Go, and enjoy.",1
7869,9.0,"I think some people need to take their heads out of their bottoms and be a bit more real with their reviews. You may not be a fan of the sequel trilogy, but seriously, how can this film be a 1 out of 10. That's a stupid rating. Are you seriously saying this is one of the worst films ever made, because if you are, you can't have seen many films.<br /><br />I've seen it once so far and thought it was loads of fun. New characters were entertaining great additions. It was nice to see Lando back. I think the humour offers plenty for adults to laugh at and loads that the kids will love. More interesting and beautiful action scenes. Some of the cinematography was stunning. Great acting, especially from the leads. I look forward to seeing it again and need to see this on imax. Ignore the grumpy crew, go and enjoy it for the fantastic family fun movie it is.",1
7870,8.0,"Indiana Jones meets the dark crystal in one of Star War's weirdest films to date, it's not the best star wars film or even the best in this trilogy but it is a good film, the score is one of the best in the franchise and Adam and Daisy's performances are fantastic!.<br /><br />Best Lightsaber fight in this trilogy",1
7871,8.0,"You people are way too critical. Let's see you write a completed script that wraps up eight movies over their time span. I liked their ending. I think they were respectful with Carrie Fisher computer generated role, and that they brought so many past characters back. Sheesh...it's better than ""Attack of the Clones""!",1
7872,8.0,"I liked it a lot. I LOVED the last two minutes. However, one major question WASN'T answered in the movie and that's disappointing.",0
7873,8.0,"I did not feel like there was anything left undone or unexplained. I loved this entire movie. I've never felt so excited about a movie in my life. The atmosphere of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was an absolutely amazing film. Thank you JJ and cast. I also enjoyed seeing a yellow lightsaber at the very end. I loved the scene between Rey and Ben when they were fighting on the same side, side by side...Just as Ben had seen before in his vision. Look there was nothing in the movie that I anticipated. I didn't expect to see Harrison Ford at all. I didn't expect to hear the force ghost voices; the Jedi who had died before. I didn't expect to see Force healing. I didn't expect to see Ben or Rey passing objects through the Force to one another, and it would later serve them in the battle against Palpatine. I didn't expect to see so many scenes with Carrie Fisher. And the way they wrapped up the ending for her was beautiful. She held the gold medallion in her hand and gave all she could to reach Ben. What energy she could muster to reach him drained her of her life and along with Rey's healing of Ben which gave him exposure to the Light Side of the Force and Leia's Love to reach him. The scene with Harrison Ford was even more poignant with the lines which came from Force Awakens. Having Palpatine in it was perfect to explain why there was still so much darkness in the universe. But the hope came from Kylo Ren when he told Palpatine he would kill him also. And while Kylo was busy getting his strength to face the Emporer, Rey was getting her strength to reach Ben. Finally, the kiss between Ben and Rey. Was amazing. We had seen them fight using the Force so long. When they were fighting on the sea I couldn't believe how much energy they put into their fight. It was astonishing. It seemed they were fighting themselves. And they were. Because they were a dyad. And together they could win but not on the dark side of the force but the light side. All the things I witnessed to wrap it up happened. I hated to see Ben die. But it made sense. He showed genuine proof that he had changed by giving his life for Rey. She deserved to live. And he knew that. You could see it in his eyes when he held her close to him. I could just see him saying, it should be me dead and not you. So I thought his sacrifice was just as beautiful as Leia's sacrifice to reach Ben...or her death would have been in vain. Palpatine was destroyed, this time melting down into nothing. And all the Sith were killed as the giant cave came down. Rey was brought back by Ben. The metal medallion was given to Chewie just as it should. None of the rest of the cast died. They lived to see a happy ending. I couldn't have imagined it any better than this. This movie was the biggest treat. I saw 3 generations come together to watch the film. There were tears of joy. For all the naysayers crying boohoo because that is all that they do, they are not real Star Wars fans. A real Star Wars fans love all Star Wars movies ever made. Believe me, I know people who cannot get enough of the world of Star Wars. So while there are the pitiful few disgruntled naysayers there are many more of us who LOVED this film and watched it numerous times. Thank you so much to JJ Abrams and to the cast of all the Star Wars films. Thank you to George Lucas for bringing us the world of Star Wars.",1
7874,7.0,"For anyone to say this movie is anything short of a blast says more about them than it does about this movie.<br /><br />Throw your favourite characters together, in space, with spaceships and lightsabers, tapping into the force, what's not to like!<br /><br />Leave your snark at the door and enjoy the blockbuster space opera for what it's always been, good guys/girls versus bad guys/girls.<br /><br />There's a lot of action and I can't wait to see it again, to take in everything I missed first time around.<br /><br />I've been a fan for 40+ years and this is as fitting an ending as I could have hoped, considering the high and lows of the previous 8 movies.<br /><br />Not perfect, but still an absolute blast 🙂",1

7877,8.0,After reading some reviews of this film I was wondering what to expect. Well I can say I really enjoyed it. Yes you can ask questions about how some things happen but if you look past that and enjoy the film as it is you won't be disappointed.,1
7878,3.0,"No need to write an overlong review as many before have given there more detailed accounts..<br /><br />One review i read suggested Watching the film without having heard anything about it,have an open mind & not one full of negative reviews - I'd call that good advice as i fell into that trap & expected to see a right stinking mess of a movie!! fortunately that wasn't the case & all thoughts of disappointment were pleasantly dispersed,its nowhere near as bad as many have said & i personally really enjoyed it 8/10",0
7879,9.0,"There were several points during the film where I felt the emotion in myself as I have very much grown attached to these characters. Called it what you will - sentimentality, nostalgia or melancholy - but I appreciated this movie in ways that were contrast to those opinions of other reviewers.",1
7880,8.0,"I didn't have much hope for the new trilogy, the force awakens was passable but doesn't rank above the prequels in my mind, the last jedi was unequivocally my least favorite Star Wars movie although I openly admit a bad Star Wars movie is better than most movies, I didn't hate it as much as the average fan did but I didn't think it fit the theme, Rise or Skywalker was a peace offering to fans after the smack in the face that was the last jedi. Rise of Skywalker did have issues but overall it was a great movie that in my opinion legitimized the new trilogy. Here is how I see it ranked;<br /><br />1. Return of the Jedi<br /><br />2. The Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />3. A New Hope<br /><br />4. Rise of Skywalker<br /><br />5. Rogue One<br /><br />6. Revenge of the Sith<br /><br />7. The Phantom Menace<br /><br />8. The Force Awakens<br /><br />9. Solo<br /><br />10. Attack of the Clones<br /><br />11. The Last Jedi",1
7881,8.0,"The film has a lot of charm and definitely delivers that popcorn cinema feeling. It is a spectacle and you enjoy it while you watch it, but if you are a lifelong Star Wars fan, who has read a ton of books, comics and played the video games, you will not be able to take this seriously. The film is a rehash of Return of the Jedi, with sprinkles of Empire Strikes Back and it feels like two movies crammed into one. The non-stop roller coaster ride is there to stop you from thinking about whether or not any of this makes sense and unfortunately in the grand scheme of the saga, it doesn't. Not only was there no plan for this trilogy, but it was only made to end what George Lucas created and bury it, so that Disney can start fresh with new characters, locations and stories, unburdened by the past. Whether the film makers realise it or not, this film's plot actively destroys the main plot for both the Original and Prequel trilogies.",1
7882,9.0,Loved it! Amazing visuals. Cool story. Cried several times. Awesome conclusion to the 40 year series.,1
7883,5.0,Great movie. Great story telling and a fitting end to the Skywalker saga!,1
7884,9.0,I was dreading this film as I didn't like the last Jedi. Having been to every Star Wars films since the start I believe I can add an opinion. I don't understand all the other people I thought it was great from the start it had all the right chemistry lots of action and witty remarks. What more do you want it's a Star Wars film it's there to enjoy so enjoy and stop tearing it apart,1
7885,10.0,"A movie from the Star Wars series. Not just one of them, but the finale. Sometime ago I watched many interviews and articles by Lucas. I was interested in where it all began. It turned out that the original idea was Star Wars to be a wonderful space fairy tale. And that was it! But the people saw in this tale an adventure, a friendship, a unity of good, so that evil could be defeated. After a while, Lucas created more parts of the great saga. Family, friends, love and the battle between good and evil. Our generations grew up with these wonderful films, but with the growth of their numbers, we grow up, and our expectations grown up with them. We began to notice some mistakes that we can see in the old films, but it was not important for us, because it was tale of our imagination. It's a cosmic tale, with a lot imagination and fantasy. As a children we didn't question anything , and that was the magic. Then we grow up...with a lot criticism and we lost the spell, the magic, that was in us...not in the new movies that we blame. Did we lose the magic? Not all of us.<br /><br />It was time when it was not important how the stormtrupers that dies with almost a look and non of all this soldiers can stop 3 kids, but we doesn't care then that this is impossible. That's not the point. There're always mistakes if you're looking for them. A woman older than my parents with her husband came to me when I cosplayed Leia at one Star Wars concert and told me that they are fans of the old series and the new once. How the old movies changed the space movies world forever and how the new once are changing with the time , but they are still amazing. They can be never an innovation like the old once, but still a good legacy. My little 12-year-old cousin, loves all the new sequences and the old once too, but for exam he feels the new once closer to him. I have a feeling that the greatest criticism came from fans of our generation (25-40), cuz like I said we grow up and everything changed, we cant watch the new once the same sentiment and eyes of a child.<br /><br />The films changed, fact. But I dare to say that in this last movie they tried to give us the end we had to see. Family and friendly story... The symbolism of the finale beyond the sci fi part.<br /><br />Mistake for me was to put all these in the last part only, they should put some of it in the 8 movie, but however.<br /><br />I think that was worthy finale of the film, followed all the basic principles and most important ideas of the movie. Watch it as we watched the first three films, with the soul of a visionary child, and you will enjoy it. I will miss all the characters we leave in this trilogy, just like in the previous ones. And I will finish with a cue from the film, which has won me, me and a lot people I know and this is the simple truth about 90% of the idea of all the movies SW",1
7886,10.0,"It shared a lot of beats with Return of the Jedi, but it still had original elements that kept me engaged all the way though. It wasn't perfect, sure. Did I think it was a satisfying end to the JJ trilogy?<br /><br />Yes. Yes, I did.",1

7888,8.0,This whole Star Wars trilogy has been a Star Wars themed feminist story with not a single redeeming feature or source of enjoyment.,0
7889,10.0,"Pretty good cinema experience, but it was a confusing story considering it was the end of this ""trilogy"". Even though I didn't like TLJ, I still think this movie should have been a follow up to that movie. This one was rather a follow up to TFA...",1
7890,2.0,"I really had a bad feeling about this movie b4 I went to see it, I mean look at the force awakens that's the same movie that I've seen 2 other times. And I thought after all the backlash from the last jedi that there was no way there would be a ""new"" star wars movie with this 1. Thought it would be the same film as jedi and done but no disney and jj suprised me. Once the scroll started I thought my gosh this thing reads like a 1920 newspaper this film is doomed but no they really took all the info and tied up all the ends without making an unwatchable film. Now there were a few cheezy parts but for the most part I thought it was fantastic perfect ending to what started as a bad trilogy and an amazing saga.",1
7891,5.0,Well. I saw the last installment of the Skywalker saga. If you want to call these last 3 movies about the Skywalker lineage at all.,1
7892,9.0,"Very people are taking very much strong with this movies, it´s just a blockbuster that its principal objective is be fun, and The rise of Skywalker is really, really fun, I think this movie is as fun as the classics, because it´s an adventure that bring our favourite characters together to action, and I think that´s the better part of the movie. There are some screenplay errors, and ´´choices´´ that if you are a fan, could be considered offensive. But in general it´s a good movie, but not great.",1
7893,5.0,"Simply put this was one of the best star wars made, it showed a in-depth look into the personal struggles between the light and dark side of the force, the struggle the rebels have facing them and it answers alot of questions. Go in with a open mind expect the unexpected and enjoy it.",1

7895,9.0,People need to remember that Star Wars is a fantasy saga - a space opera. Just relax and be entertained - it's actually really enjoyable and fun. Stop nit picking and go chill at the movies. 😊,1
7896,9.0,"Lots of improvised plot points. They had a trilogy for crying out loud! They had three different movies to develop story arcs like Rey Palpatine, Palpatine's agenda, Luke searching for him all these years and training Rey to defeat him would have been more believable than Luke just giving up on life, Ben revealing Rey's true origins in the Last Jedi, rather than telling that 'you're nothing' big fat lie, Leia being a Force user (which has me thinking, how comes she didn't train her son if she was that good?). But no, they just kept introducing new characters (besides the leads) who were supposed to be big deals in one episode, only to kill them off or neglect them completely in the next (Hux, Phasma, Rose, Holdo and whoever Benicio del Toro's character whose name I don't even care to remember). Sure the visuals are spectacular, but the first trilogy managed to tell a far better story with far more modest technology. And lastly, even though Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley shine in their portrayals, their characters were poorly served in this movie.",0
7897,8.0,I thought it was a solid movie. May reviews on here are just impossible to please. Some of the arguments are good points but I feel that's part of being a Star Wars fan. You always have things you would have wanted done different or better but I thought all in all it was a ton of fun. If you go watch it and just try and enjoy it instead of carrying all of these impossible expectations it's actually a great ride.,1
7898,2.0,"Let me start by saying I am totally okay with the overall storyline for the trilogy, however the flow of the story from movie to movie is a mess. Unfortunately The Rise of Skywalker suffers from The Last Jedi failing to advance this story, causing it to feel very rushed. Had some of what is revealed and certain events from ROS happened in TLJ it would have been much smoother. Unfortunately there was not much JJ could do about that so this is the end result. I really don't think this movie is as horrible as some are saying, it is fun and enjoyable, but it could have been so much more with better execution of the storytelling.",0
7899,7.0,"Cannot believe the negative reviews. Great story, great acting, and nostalgia to add. People trying to ruin everything and won't just enjoy something meant for enjoyment.",1
7900,7.0,"After hearing so much negative reviews about this for the last couple of weeks, I was at odds to even attend this movie. So glad I went. For all the negative reviews, I find them just ridiculous. This end was not only fitting but tied things together, even after episode 8 was lack luster, this movie swooped in and brought it all together. I dont believe it fixed anything, I thing it expanded and added to the story in a way that brought conclusion to this trilogy.",0
7901,9.0,"Apart from the 2 or 3 interesting scenes, and actors doing a decent job, the plot was simply nonsense. Barely worth watching, and has made me not want to bother with any future Star Wars films ever. The potential to do something really new and novel was wasted in this and the last 2 films...",0
7902,9.0,"A grand and serviceable end to this nostalgia fitted sequel trilogy. There is so much packed into this one that will probably take a while process. I loved the tech upgrades given to the various characters, Kylo Ren's journey and the grandeur of the final hour. I am inclined to up my rating because making a finale that meets at least some of the expectations of each one of the varied fanbase is a near impossible task and JJ Abrams, I think, has succeeded.",1
7903,,"This film is enough, surely one of the worst in the saga, there are too many cuts in the editing, especially in the parts of Ren, since over half of the film nothing relevant happens there is not a climax in growth. Lack of epic, there are no significant deaths, wars are won with sacrifices. The film is completely fan service, Disney family friendly. Spoiler: honestly I would have killed Chewbca to increase the final clash. I would not have resurrected palpatine, but they could have had him killed by Ren-Rey's final battle, or let Rey pass to the dark side and Ren who becomes a Skywalker and kills her, or both have gone to the dark side, but rey just pretends to get close to ren and then betray him by killing him. The perfect ending would have been rey kills ren, does not cure him, kills palpatine, who moves into his body and sacrifices himself with the second sword ending the saga, no more empire, no more strength. All finals better than what I've seen. The CGI is not worthy of the old films, there are no major land battles, the thousands of completely useless destroyers, the horses over the spaceships? But let's joke .. What a trash. They could offer much more, besides the film lasted just over 2 hours, it took at least another 40 minutes.",0
7904,7.0,A few good things 1) sound 2) pictures..... The storyline is awfully disappointing... This episode is ruining the Original Star Wars that we have been knowing,0
7905,6.0,"I understand why die hard Star Wars fans who romanticize about the original have trouble liking any of this. These are just the people who expect so much of it to be like the originals. That's not how it works. This movie wasn't perfect, but it's main flaw comes from the fact that this trilogy wasn't well planned from the beginning. With that being said, like the previous two, this movie on its own is extremely entertaining and moving.",1
7906,7.0,"I won't go into detail why its only 4 Stars for this one, so here is what bugged me most.",0
7907,9.0,"This movie is a failure without a question. So many plot holes, so many questions left unanswered... I hate that they retconned Leya into becoming a jedi, it just completely destroys the lore of the Return of the Jedi. Palpatine coming back for basically no reason. It's like after two mess of a movies the directors just said "" Hey let's just add Palpatine and be done with it. We can't go wrong with that now can we? "" WELL IT TURNS OUT YOU ACTUALLY CAN!!! I am so disappointed about this trilogy overall. It's like pretending to be Star Wars. It's got the looks, but none of the heart and soul.",0
7908,4.0,Disney's arrogance and lazy handling of this movie (trilogy) - as if simply buying the rights to Star Wars would guarantee George Lucas' genius - is extremely arrogant & disappointing.,0
7909,3.0,"Look, this movie is probably not going to change your mind about sequel trilogy, but if you just sit and wach the movie without any prejudice you will find out that it is quite good movie.<br /><br />JJ did best that he could do with story that he got, but to be honest he did play again safe with nostalgic phrases and characters...<br /><br />There are things that I expected to happen, but didn't and some things that I imagined differently, but that's life - you don't always get what you want.<br /><br />There was never chance for this movie to satisfy all SW fans. This movie is more of a damage control and it does that pretty well.<br /><br />At the end I don't feel sorry for spending money on a ticket.",1
7910,3.0,"Lately, I have been watching the last three episodes.",0
7911,8.0,"I was in the theatre with the movie coming to a close and I was ready to say it was the best Star Wars I'd ever seen. And then the managed to screw all of it up. Rey and Kylo Ren had chemistry and tension through all of the movies. The movies gave you a feeling that he would be redeemed, which is something we haven't seen in the Star Wars universe yet. I was so happy when she called him Ben and they kissed, and then it happened. They killed him off. Not only did they do that, they killed him in possibly the sloppiest, fastest, and most ridiculous way I have ever seen in any movie, let alone a Star Wars movie. I couldn't believe it. The whole theater laughed as Kylo fell to the ground randomly and faded out for no apparent reason. It was SUCH A GOOD MOVIE, AND THEN THEY DID THAT. REY HAD LITERALLY JUST FALLED OVER TO THE GROUND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND THEN HE FALLS OVER RANDOMLY TO THE OTHER DIRECTION??? THAT IS TEXTBOOK PHYSICAL COMEDY PUT INTO A DEATH SCENE FOR A MAIN CHARACTER OF A SERIOUS MOVIE. Its embarrassing for the Star Wars franchise.. I don't understand who thought that was a good idea. Honestly so frustrated about it. I cant.",0
7912,8.0,"Look the movie is very good! So many nods to previous movies and thankfully clones wars, rebels and even resistance.<br /><br />It's hard to finish a epic saga and they don't do an awful job. Yes you can say it repeats story lines but it still a good movie and a good enough finish to a epic series.",0
7913,5.0,"I liked the majority of the story! There were just some weird things like ""hyperspace skipping"" and Rey and Ben at the end. Loved Palpatine",1
7914,9.0,"First of all I want to say that, for the most part, the movie is very enjoyable; incredible visuals and John Williams & co were exceptional as always. But it was such a mess. I can't help but feel like Disney have spat on the Star Wars saga with this new trilogy for the sake of making money. It's blatantly obvious now that there was not a plan in place before they made TFA and that after TLJ, they decided to go in a completely different direction - if they wanted to back-pedal any faster they would have needed a hyperdrive. There was also a huge amount of things that were just glazed over: Palpatine's return, new powers and new concepts of the force, just to name a few. There was also a huge amount of questionable dialogue. From stupid and cheesy lines, to Luke completely contradicting things he did and said in the previous movie, to lines taken straight from Avengers Endgame (honestly it couldn't have been any more obvious). Despite some great throwbacks and despite arguably being the best movie in the trilogy - I still wish they hadn't made the sequel trilogy and that they had stuck to spin offs like Rogue One and The Mandolorian.",0
7915,7.0,Toxic star wars fans will never be satisfied. I loved every second of it.,1
7916,5.0,"Im a die hard star wars fan and i was pleased to see that Disney did not make this a reboot of Ep6 (like Ep7 was reboot of Ep4 and Ep8 was reboot of Ep5). This was a unique and delightful story. There were missing pieces, yes, and some of the acting was lacking. It was a solid Star Wars movie....Ep5 is still the best though.",1
7917,10.0,This movie is beyond disappointing. This movie could've been the universally liked movie in the Sequel Trilogy but it sadly isn't. Every single unique moment becomes almost immediately redundant. For example:,0
7918,8.0,"I have seen the movie twice (3D and 2D) and I really liked it.<br /><br />It was not perfect, but besides the OT, what movie is? It had plotholes, but so had the other movies of the Saga. I liked the acting of the main cast, the chemistry between them, the visuals, soundtrack, the story of a truly phantom menace and I thought the ending was fitting for the 9-movie-Saga. Story strings were brought to an end, new mysteries were unveiled and while I understand that not everyone will be happy with the way things were done, personally I could not have wished for more. Thank you for bringing the trilogy and the Saga to this end, it means the world to me.<br /><br />I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember and I was close to tears of joy (and sadness!) during this movie. It was a great ride and I will see it again. And again. May the Force be with you",1
7919,5.0,"The only ambitious aspect about this movie is how much stuff they try to fit into it without prolonging the run time. This movie feels bloated as hell and this is probably because of: A. Disney not sticking to one overall vision for the entire trilogy and B, JJ trying to steer it back from where Rian Johnson took it in episode VIII.",0
7920,9.0,Despite I knew about the spoilers I still truly enjoyed it,1
7921,5.0,"JJ might be a good director, but as an ending this movie breaks a lot of things within the universe. I walked in with little expectations and laughed at the really canned dialogue and breaking of logic that flows throughout the movie, but as a star wars movie, this very much is not worth your time.",0
7922,9.0,"Eight was so bad I went in knowing I would hate what I saw tonight, but I didn't I walked out Happy. I enjoyed the movie and the twists. Yes there was cheesy parts and unnecessary characters, but over all as a huge Star Wars fan I felt like they made a very entertaining movie and made me feel like a kid again seeing Star Wsrs",1
7923,4.0,"This movie met all the expectations that it could (following the horrendous The Last Jedi). I enjoyed it, and if you love Star Wars, you will too.",1
7924,8.0,Very good film no where near as bad as some of the comments on here did it answer questions yes but it also asked some it will devide opinion there were things i didnt like but there was alot more that i did like all in all very good closing movie well done jj,1
7925,9.0,Here's the good: Finally we get to see some actual use of a plethora of force powers and lightsaber duels. The choreography is amazing. Lots of action.,1
7926,7.0,Some things I don't exactly agree with choices made but since when does that need to happen. I loved the movie and was entertained. Will see it again and again.,1
7927,8.0,This was supposed to be THE final epic ending to Star Wars not Marvel's Avengers!,0
7928,8.0,It was actually very enjoyable. I felt it tied the whole story together and it made me love Star Wars even more.,1
7929,8.0,"Rey randomly read a book. A few moments later they are told to find an artifact so they can find the Sith holocron. Rey says ""I just read about that in the latest magazin"". What a coincidence...",0
7930,10.0,I had below zero expectations. there were some let downs but the overall story is good,0
7931,3.0,NO SPOILERS!,0
7932,9.0,"This movie won't talk down to you, it won't try to make you feel that what you like is stupid, or destroy how you see your favorite characters. This movie is better than the Last Jedi in every way, and the Force Awakens is far too derivative to be considered an original movie. A clear story, good twists, emotion, and a satisfying conclusion that had to do a lot given the terrible job Rian Johnson did.",0
7933,9.0,Honestly it's such a different take on Star Wars but a good one. Dark but with humor. Exploring new elements of the force. And the cinematography was stunning. Palpatine was awesome and looked creepy as ever. Story was nice and tied it all together well. Go in with an open mind and enjoy it. Loved it.,1
7934,8.0,The pressure to please the real fans is to big...but for me as a nutral fan i really was enjoying it...for me it was entertaining fun and enjoyable...sorry real fans...but it is a good movie 🙏,1
7935,10.0,Solid movie. Right on par with the previous 2 movies.,1
7936,,"First of all, the Last Jedi didn't leave JJ Abrams much to work with. I thought most of the saga was concluded when Luke died. Plus, Kylo Ren's execution of Snoke left JJ without a decent villain to drive his movie. That being said, I think Disney and JJ Abrams told a pretty good story. My son and I were entertained for the entire 2+ hours. It was nice to see Finn and Poe back together. Their on screen chemistry is really great.",1
7937,7.0,Great movie if you don't go into it expecting to see the exact mental picture you have painted in your mind of what you think Star wars should be. Be open-minded and acceptive and you will NOT be let down.,1
7938,8.0,JJ did his best to fix the mess that is the last Jedi.,0
7939,8.0,"Started well. Has a few minor flaws but easily overlooked as the movie path was great. Kyle Ren has a great scene with his memories... it feels like this could be something...then the cheese kicks in! What was that? You have enough cheesiness? OK, here's more for you then. I also felt like it heavily crossed with Independence Day there at one point. After all that, the cheese still continued. I'm glad it was closed well though, and the last scene was perfect.",1
7940,8.0,"It's very true that the film lacks I typical star wars narrative beat. However, it's not going to be the next citizen kane! Its Star wars! The reason I have given this 9 stars is for the fact I walked away feeling entertained. I've been a fan ever since my mum showed me Empire Strikes Back on VHS. To sit and see all the characters I've grown up seeing, show up on screen brings feelings of nostalgia and excitement. So many cameos! It is s much better film than the last jedi by far!. It's well worth it to get to the third act of the film though. For me to see all original characters such as...Luke, Leia, Lando and Han!!!!! Was amazing! The fact the Rey is a palpatine was obvious but fitted nicely towards the end. I recommend you see at the cinema! Just to see it for the spectacle that it is!",0
7941,6.0,"Not the best Star Wars movie of all time, but it was enjoyable. The story (Saga) had to come to an end, and so it did. I don't understand why folks are giving it 1 or 2. After the show I overheard people criticizing it. Will I see it again. Yes.",1
7942,9.0,"Took three tries, but they finally did a Star Wars sequel worthy of the name. It has originality, star wars dialogue, ALIENS, amazing use of the Force, great character development, C-3PO isn't a prop and is a great addition, Babu Frick, and a great conclusion. Best part, it fixes most of The Last Jedi's problems.",1
7943,8.0,"Watched this with my kids, for who this was the first full trilogy to see. They love Rey and the connection between her and Kylo/Ben. They love the fun, the struggle, the strength and the action. Sure this movie has flaws, as do all trilogies I guess. And wht does everything has to be explained, its fiction! Fill in the blanks with your own fantasy.<br /><br />We had a great time and can't wait to see it again, on Disney+.",1

7951,10.0,"I believe J.J. Did the best with what he was given to work with. I don't agree with Kylo dying off and there is no mention of the force sensitive children from the Last Jedi. It seems a bit rushed and tossed together with no room for emotional buildup. Maybe if it took the End Game route and was a 3 hour film, but hey....there's always Mandalorian and Kenobi to look forward to.",1
7952,7.0,"An excellent ending on a 50year old saga. I can see most reviews just say that it's crap... I liked it a lot. I don't really understand why... Excellent pace, excellent score, very good acting, off the charts visuals. It connects with all previous films and it prepares you for the next ones. Is it the plot then? Perhaps you thought something else should have happened? Well it's a shame they didn't ask you. Next time they should. I bet you also didn't like the second trilogy... I also bet that you didn't like Rildey Scots Prometheus and covenant or even the Matrix. At least until someone explained it to you. How many of you have taken part at any level of a filmaking process... Have you even made coffee for the crew? Please spare us your expert opinions... And please don't watch the next one...<br /><br />It was epic... And it is Star Wars! It is all it can be. Bravo to Disney! Bravo to JJ Abraams. He has done it again! Go and enjoy it!",1
7953,6.0,J.J Abrams was put to a really difficult task.,0
7954,9.0,"Good movie, action is good plot is sometimes a bit too convenient. Palpatine is possibly camper than he was in the 80s which is fantastic, I went to see an entertaining movie and I was entertained. Anybody giving this one star is probably dead inside... now for the spoilers: said from force awakens rey would be a Palpatine so that didn't really surprise me, kylos turn to the light was a bit rushed considering he was trying to kill rey for almost the entire movie beforehand, the final battle on exagor is a lot of fun and Richard E Grant is as usual fantastic, hux was his usual whiny self which works well in making you dislike him. The death star saber battle is as good as any in the series, not as twirly as the prequels but then there's been no Jedi to train them the way the prequel characters were trained. My main issues in the movie were the kylo turn as I mentioned and possibly the end between rey and Palpatine being too dark, other than that I left happy.",1
7955,8.0,"I am a 55 year old Star Wars fan. Star Wars has had me from the very first note of the theme and scrolling intro of the very first movie. I have liked some of the movies better than others but have always gone in with open mindedness and nostalgia. I'm not looking for a deep meaning or intricate plot. Just plain, simple entertainment. I personally thought this movie was great. Saw some old characters as well as new! I took my Granddaughter and we had a great time. She couldn't stop talking about it afterwards. It's something she will remember doing when she is grown up just like I'm doing now. That is what it's all about in my view. My suggestion is to go see it and form your own opinion. Try to Relax and enjoy instead of judge!!",1

Visual effects were amazing, music was great and I actually like the new characters and cast.",1
7958,10.0,"After seeing this last film of the final trilogy, which is supposed to complete what we all have been waiting for for forty years, I could say plenty of things about how spectacular it was, how the duality was interesting, how Ben giving his life to Rey was touching, how through all the disappointments it really seemed like an ending. Or how bad it was, how inconsistent, how simple, how fake. But I don't even want to talk about that. I just want to talk about how after some days, I realized that the good thing Star Wars was, the good thing the real Star Wars people learned to rely on and live with throughout these 40 years, no longer was good. In vain my spirit kept calling upon this thing, but where in the past there was quick satisfaction and solution, there was now nothing. What about us now? What about the Star Wars people? Disney has spoiled and corrupted the good name Star Wars was, meddling with a Force of which they had and have absolutely no understanding, and turned it into something bad and useless, leaving us with nothing. That good name was more important than finishing the three trilogies, and now I'd rather have that they had kept things the way the were, even after the prequels. We Star Wars people are left with no other choice then to buy into something else now, because what was worth about Star Wars, is now worthless. So sad.",0
7959,9.0,"Being a middle school and high school teacher you learn to be flexible and to approach students and people with new slates everyday. If you don't and place predisposed grudges and judgements you'll end up an unhappy camper. I had zero faith in JJ after TFA because it was such a copy and paste derivative mess of a film - so much that it made me appreciate the prequels more and the vision (but lack of execution) of Lucas. TLJ I cheered because certain scenes I knew the whiny fanboys would complain about because why? Johnson took risks with its storytelling and imagery. I came in TROS with below negative expectations but took that mentality of a clean slate with JJ. The further I was going through the film the more I felt like the Star Wars-feel was coming back. Are there still some narrative and plot questions? Sure, but what SW film doesn't have some? Long story short I bought two sets of tickets - one at 6pm and one at 9:35 when sales opened back in October just to make sure I covered my bases. Ended up seeing both and was still in a euphoric state both viewings. Already make plans with a more faithful, non-whiny SW fan to see again next week! Can't wait!",0

The first twenty minutes or so felt a bit rushed and choppy but once it got going it improved.<br /><br />I managed to avoid spoilers beforehand except for one about ""First LGBT kiss in Star Wars Franchise""<br /><br />I mean, I immediately assumed it was between Poe and Finn, of course, and spent the entire movie waiting for it.<br /><br />It was .... between two female extras, in the final scene, and I don't think the camera was even entirely focused on them.<br /><br />Would've preferred something much more, but at least it was better than Endgame's attempt at LGBT representation.",0

7970,8.0,"I'm going to preset this by saying that at least in most capacity, I have enjoyed this new trilogy quite a bit. I wasn't born for the original saga, and was barely old enough to comprehend the prequels before their end. So for all intensive purposes, this is the story and the characters I grew up. So for it to feel and end up like Last-Jedi cruise control sprinkled with a ton of nostalgia for two and a half hours is disheartening to say the least. Palpatine's alive and has been manipulating everything from the start, Snoke's one of his (many ?) clones. Do they explain how he's managed to survive this long? Nope. Luke's all of a sudden just hanging out like his sacrifice meant nothing and calling himself a fool for his TLJ actions. Nice jab at Rian there, JJ. Quite mature. Remember how scary Hux was in The Force Awakens? His epic speech before he unleashed the terror of the Starkiller base? Well, turns out he was a spy. He was just pretending to be an extremely pompous evil space general. Ray's parents were nobodies? Ha, you wish. Everything needs to be connected, she's Palpatine's granddaughter! Every single decision made in this movie, is to either backpedal on everything done in TLJ, or to jerk off the old trilogy fans who stuck around this long only to witness their original trio get dragged to hell and back in the name of character development. Meanwhile we also introduce a multitude of new characters into the fray, and still try to juggle the new-ish and old all at once. Sheesh! Shoutout John Williams and the performers trying to keep this sinking ship together, Adam baby, I'm so sorry. Imagine having one of the best arcs in the entire three trilogies just to die a virgin. Goddamn shame.",0

7974,7.0,"It's not the perfect Star Wars movie but it offers a satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga. JJ took what he had from VII and VIII and did a fun adventure that finishes up a story 40 years in the making. It was always going to be controversial, but in my opinion it finished the trilogy with an enjoyable ending.",1
7975,8.0,"Maybe I am not the majority here, but I loved the movie as a movie! I don't waste my time to think this and that, like continuity stuff... It is what it is! Make better yourself! It isn't so easy when you start to think..",0

There are so many negative reviews out there, but in my opinion that's just the same as always. I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and I've never really understood why so many other so called 'fans' so nothing but complain about what they claim they love so much. A true fan of something looks for what they love, not what they despise. Yes we all have our ideas about what could and maybe should happen but at the end of the day it is not our story to tell.<br /><br />I did not overly enjoy The Last Jedi, but I still managed to find positives to say about it & now the trilogy has concluded it puts the Last Jedi in a much better light. The Last Jedi is the dark before the dawn of the Last Skywalker.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in The Last Skywalker, but to me that's great! It non stop action and storytelling all the way.<br /><br />There are many nods to a whole array of past films and various Star Wars cannon and I think that's awesome. I do t know why so many people have a problem with this.",1
7981,9.0,"Having watched the opening film of this trillogy, The Force Awakens, it left me with a sense of optimism that this story could and would unfold into what we all hoped it would. TFA was quite enjoyable, with fantastic CGI, an amazing cast of decent actors and a storyline that had potential.",0
7982,9.0,"After the terrible start to this series, TFA was truly terrible and shouldn't have ever been made. The Last Jedi was a new concept at least but it went on to damage the franchise when inexplicably changing Luke's character beyond recognition. It was also pretty boring generally. Therefore I didn't have much hope going in towards chi this next piece of Disney garbage... however, I was surprised. Yes there are many flaws to the story and let's face it, the story of Skywalker should've ended at the Return if the Jedi. But instead they dug this up in a vain attempt to pull in classic fans and new. But JJ Abraham's recipe fits well and it's an entertaining film there's no getting away from that fact. He's done a great job of correcting a lot of the crap that we've been fed in the last 2 movies. Even developing Rey and Fin etc. He even made Ren a decent, flawed villain in the end. I would recommend to go and see it. It's spectacular in vision and has all the right Hollywood emotional pulls. Most of all it finally puts and end to the Skywalker story and that felt acceptable. There's no doubt they'll go somewhere next, but for the Skywalker era we've grown up with, it's a curtain call.",0
7983,4.0,"This film felt like really bad fan fiction right from the opening text crawl. It starts at break neck speed and doesn't slow down, it leaves you no time to breath or reflect on big events. Absolutely no dynamics or nuance. There so many plot holes and moments that leave you laughing out loud at what is the hell is happening. For me this is the worst Star Wars film so far, it ties up nothing at the end except for the very strange plot points that felt forced and panic written for this film. When the end finally came I was just left with the feeling of disappointment and a realisation that this was the most pointless trilogy they could have made.",0
7984,7.0,I thought this was one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen or more like SCENE!!! Absolute tears flowing down my face after the amazing kiss! The suspense was absolutely killing me! I wish they would have just hurried up with the fighting and get back to the real tension in the room! I loved the most recent movies and decided to go back to the previous movies to see what the fuss was about and boy was I disappointed. So dark and boring! I am so glad with the new way the story has turned and think that there is no reason Star Wars cant continue on in this new light. Also I love that there is more wild creatures instead of storylines.,1
7985,4.0,This is my first ever review on IMDb but felt compelled to add a review after having seen all the negative reviews as a major fans.,1
7986,10.0,"There are a thousand things wrong with this movie. From bad pacing, choppy editing, the story can't pick a lane, etc. There are some good concepts, but I'm not sure it gets too much credit because it didn't really execute them well. It's clearly at odds with the other movies in this Trilogy, and the Saga as a whole.<br /><br />But at the end of the movie, I realized the worst thing about it was that I felt nothing.<br /><br />I was never exited, I was never upset. I'm not angry that this movie was a disappointment to me. I doubt I'll even remember my movie going experience. I saw a Star Wars mainline movie in theaters and it was one of the least memorable movie going experiences I've had.<br /><br />Just a few weeks ago I was rewatching the Original Trilogy and even after all these year and multiple viewings I still got chills. That's almost embarrassing to say about cheesy sci-fi movies ""made for kids."" Even the Star Wars movies I don't like make me feel something. Anger for feeling like it ruined something thst came before. Regret and the failed potential of characters and story. They could make me laugh by being so bad.<br /><br />But it's clear this movie was dead before it ever breathed. The ""creative"" ""team"" was uninspired and at odds with each other. There were boxes and limits put on them from past movies. But obstacles in the creative process can make a product greater than it would have been without them. But instead this movie decided to ignore these limitations and in doing so it all feels hollow.<br /><br />I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again. I don't even recommend other people to watch it. I don't think it's worth someone's time. This movie was just cranked out to finish the Disney Trilogy on time. There's no heart, there's no emotion. There's nothing.",0
7987,9.0,"The movie is not that bad, after the 7th and the 8th, it couldn't really go elsewhere. But the final result of this trilogy is very poor. It's almost a parody of the real Star Wars movies.<br /><br />Somebody can start A PETITION TO REMOVE THIS FAKE STAR WARS TRILOGY please ?!",0
7988,3.0,The return of the imperor was incredible and rey being is grandchild,1
7989,4.0,"My review will not be restricted to the AMAZING effects(battle scenes/landscapes etc),the STUNNING music score by our beloved John Williams or the actually FUNNY jokes that fitted the plot well.<br /><br />My goal is to show what plot points I enjoyed and found that offer closure to the story as a Star wars fan and which I did not:<br /><br />1)Poe is given some decent backstory and proves his ability to inspire and command<br /><br />2)Finn is force sensitive as implied in many occasions which explains his impulse to desert the first order and adds some interesting background to the character<br /><br />3)The droids have their special roles,each of them vital for the plot.<br /><br />4)Luke,Leia are handled perfectly and with respect.The scene where Luke trains Leia is G(old) and a long time coming incident. It also gives Leia's capability of training Rey-connecting to Ben legitimacy.Luke's overall scene redeems the TLJ mistakes and the scene with him lifting the X-wing draws the sentimental parallels with his training with Master Yoda.Their co-existence in the final scene brings closure to the Skywalker Saga.<br /><br />5)Han Solo(memory),Lando Calrissian play their roles well and bring the much needed nostalgia. Han helps his son find his way and Lando comes for the rescue the very moment he is needed.He also reunited with the Falcon,closing this circle also perfectly.<br /><br />6)Rey is given a backstory that justifies her powers and furtherly invreases her inside conflict of light and darkness.She finally manages to""conplete"" her training(summon the power of all Jedi spirits,which she failed to fo in the first scenes),defeat her greatest fear;herself(thus the projection of herself in the dark side in the Death Staf ruins(as was Vader for Luke in Empire)) and finally bring balance to the force and creating the ""Skywalkers"" as the next generation of Jedi,carrying the yellow saber,thus the name ""Rey Skywalker"" at the end(apart from a tribute to her only true family,her masters Luke and Lea and her late lover Ben,all Skywalkers)<br /><br />7)Ben is strong in this one,overpowering Rey(as he should do due to his superior training and descendance)only to ""lose the combat"" due to his nother interference.He confronts his dilemma of Light and Darkness with strength and follows his true path to light aided by the mind strength his mother provides him with and the sentimental push the vivid memory of his father offers.He finally stands against the man that manipulated him and destroyed his life,firstly defeating his corrupt creation(Knights of Ren) and then,pulling up the ultimate dark side force capability,deads' revival(only Darth Plagueis the wise had this power)he saves the one he loves,drawing the parallel to Anakin Skywalker;thus not only finishing what he started but rising even higher.He dies an acconplised user of the Dark side powers,yet with the heart and spirit of a Jedi,becoming actually the first of the new ""grey"" Jedis.<br /><br />8)Paplatines newest corruption offers reasonamce for Rey's strength,Snoke and even Luke's fear in TLJ.His immense powers get him once again in the domination yet he is defeated by his own ""corruption"";that is his granddaughter whose parents' execution was ordered by him and Ben,descendant of the man who created and trapped into darkness(Vader).The ultimate story concludes in the simple line:<br /><br />United,Light always beats Darkness.Jedi prevail and the Sith,all living in Paplatines spirit(whixh is another lovely touche to justify his powers),are anihillated.<br /><br />Facts as,lack of background in Hux's betrayal,lack of Knights of Ren use in combat and such simple ""mistakes"" can be neglected considering how much this movie had to fix.Overall a great ecperience twice in the theatre.Thank you JJ Abraams,this movie pleases the fans and saves Star Wars no matter how simplistic,hasty or over the top .it might be.",1
7990,9.0,"Feel rush, many story line seems forced. like make Leia Jedi Master. WTF.<br /><br />They tried to fix the last jedi with this film, but the damage has been done.<br /><br />Rey is the worst star wars character since jar jar binks. The writers should have done better writing rey. why not make her jedi apprentice since beginning? why try to make the same situation like original trilogy. they should make jedi school again like the prequels. I really wish that.",0
7991,7.0,Sorry but I am just so pissed on how they end General Hux character. He deserved much more and at least let him have a final battle of wit or something with Kylo. Worst character development of all.,0
7992,5.0,"Ok so most if you have seen Rise of Skywalker but I'm not into spoiling anyway. I thought the film was entertaining, I cared about what happened to the characters, I liked the new editions, I appreciate the humor involved and the story kept my attention.",1
7993,6.0,"I grew up with Star Wars (Ep IV - VI) and watched the originals and the prequels literally more than a hundred times.<br /><br />Of course I loved the originals and most parts of the prequels (despite Jar Jar Binks, some cheesy dialogues in Ep. II).<br /><br />I had mixed expectations about Ep VII ( I personally think it was quite an impossible project to - one the one hand - satisfy the die hard fans and - on the other other hand - attract the (younger and new) audience at the same time.<br /><br />But in the end the result was quite ok despite the recycling of the story line of Ep. IV...<br /><br />Ep. VIII was quite disappointing. I watched it twice in the theatres. The story was not good at all and I was wondering why Rey thought she needed training at all since you got the impression that she is already a fully-trained Jedi.<br /><br />Well, I watched Ep. IX today the second time within one week.<br /><br />After watching it the first time I honestly wasn't sure how to rate it.<br /><br />But today I can honestly say it is worth 8/10 in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course it's for sure not the perfect Star Wars movie at all. I had very low expectations after Ep. VIII. Actually I wasn't even looking forward to watching it. I just wanted to see the result of Disney's approach to put and end of one of the greatest movie sagas in history.<br /><br />Personally I think it delivers a fast paced story. Ok, Palpatine's revival wasn't convincing at all in the trailers. But the first 5 minutes into the movie I felt like - wow, ok let's see where this going to...<br /><br />I still think that Adam Driver wasn't the perfect joice for the (young) villain. He seemed more to be a spoiled boy who desperately needed more guidance when it comes to his education.<br /><br />But the way he finally turned back to the light side - I really pitied him in a certain way - and the part with him talking to his dad - it somehow reminded me of Clark Kent talking to his late father.<br /><br />I loved the way they brought all the (old) characters back for this grande finale (visually and aurally).<br /><br />I honestly had no clue that Rey was a Palpatine. The final scene between Ben and her was - well at first I hoped it wouldn't end like Romeo and Juliet - authentic. It would have been more awkward when Ben would have survived but in the end he proved he is a true Skywalker (Solo) by giving up his own life in order to rescue the one he had feelings for.<br /><br />And Rey: I liked the way she finally became a Skywalker. She never asked for it. She never knew who she really was until she encountered the force...<br /><br />The Star Wars saga for me is like family: You grew up with it, you love it, you got disappointed by it and you thought that life goes on without it but in the end you realize that it is part of your life and you are just happy to experience all the not so good times and better times with it.",1
7994,9.0,"As a star wars fan since the original trilogy, I can say this is a great star wars movie. It has great light sabers duels and space battles. The ongoing struggle against fear that leads to the dark side is central to the story as it should be. Some reviewers seem to be loosing the battle against their fears whatever those maybe. Just enjoy the movie and leave behind you worries for a couple of hours.",1
7995,8.0,I saw the Rise of Skywalker two times. The first time i thought it was one of the greatest films this year. This movie emotionally absorbed me and I was shocked. But the second time I watched it I saw a rushed end of a bad trilogy that had not enough time to rescue this trilogy (espacially Part 8). At the end I am more dissapointed than happy but I have to give a higher rating because of my first #experience with this movie.,1
7996,9.0,"Of course, the best Star Wars episodes are the ones you remember as a kid, but with this last episode JJ Abrams surely comes close to reviving the initial story and the true 'Star Wars feeling'. I truly don't understand all the cheap critisism for this last episode. From the first few minutes on you're drawn into a well structured story with lots of action, plausible answers to different questions and a magnificent grand finale.",1
7997,6.0,I haven't been a fan of the disney oriented star wars films. But this was about as good as we can get from anyone not George Lucas. Alot of the criticism from this film i believe could have been avoided if J J Abrams hadn't had to correct the tragedy that was last jedi. He could have spent time slowing this film down a little instead of having to fix things. Not a perfect film but still a much better than episode 8 the Last Crap,0
7998,9.0,I loved this movie and don't understand what issue the critics have with it.This movie was the second best of all the new star wars movies behind the force awakens.,1
7999,9.0,"Ok, I understand that they had to get the attention of the fans, especially after the great failure that was TLJ. However, there are ways to do things, but with this movie they showed us that they are not clear about what they are doing and apparently it's really difficult to come up with a great plot that respects their own canon and the work that it's already done.",1

8005,3.0,"The movie is great, it has adventure it has drama and brings joy to the Skywalker saga, but the movie goes very fast some things happen and just happen like it was anything, and didn't take the time to concentrate in very specific matters in the movie, than little things that don't matter to the center storyline, and we could have expected a finale that concentrates and concludes everything in the saga but we just got a simple fight like no other and doesn't feel like a strong ending to the saga. But I give this movie an 8 because I think is really good, one of my favorite movies in the saga after episodeV and because is a thrilling movie.",1

This is really good film and okay it is maby not the ending some die hard fans want but star wars can not be the same like original films and people who just want it to be like those will be forever hungry. This is a story for a generation and damn they got a really good one",0
8008,9.0,"Harvey Weinstein was nicer to women and showed them more respect than Kathleen Kennedy did to Star Wars. This movie trys at least to correct some mistakes the previous made (and fails at it) but mostly it doesnt have a story. The actors are bad but by far not the biggest problem and special effects are good. There is no humor (because the script clearly was done by a Chimpansee on crack) but what hit me late in the movie: they activly tried to have no  or love in the movie. The saddest part was seeing ""based on characters created by George Lucas"" in the end.",0
8009,9.0,"Several people wrote that this movie was a slap on the face to Rian Jhonson. That it couldn't be ruder to him. I disagree. So of course, I was expecting something massive to undo some of the decisions done in The Last Jedi, like getting Luke more involved, but it pretty much stays faithful to it and our favorite Master Jedi stays very dead. He Barely shows up to guide Rey for a couple of minutes. That's it. No more Luke. Neither Obi Wan or Yoda less alone the chosen one.",0

And haters, remember this : there's no flying princess in space this time, or a legendary hero milking a cow! Oups...and don't forget Canto Bight !! Such cringeworthy scenes simply kills The Last Jedi for me. In comparison, The Rise of Skywalker is a masterpiece!",1
8012,,"I think sometimes people just hate to hate, this movie was satisfying in every aspect of the sense.

8014,10.0,"Arm chair critics are harsh and i would like to see them do a better job and not get blasted. I've been a huge fan all my life and I've read so many of the stories. I don't just like Star Wars I love Star Wars! But to go into this movie thinking that everything was going to be perfect is pure crud. But, in my opinion it all works. I see connections that others say came out of now where. I think it was more emotional and feeling than analytical story telling. Some of the negatives I'm reading...<br /><br />1) Rey is a palpatine all of a sudden. ""What?!"" Come on, like, you couldn't feel that there was more after TLJ? You really thought that her parents were nobody and accepted that?",1
8015,1.0,I read some of the reviews. They are from people who build up impossible expectations the take the first opportunity to crap on the movie. The five and below star reviews are from uninteresting people who probably aren't even nice people. Double-park in a handicap spot because they need their smoothie now kind of people. Don't listen to them.,0

8018,7.0,"Long time Star Wars fan. Ya know why the original trilogy was so good? Because it was fun, it was an adventure, and it was friends sharing the ride together w/ comedy along the way. It also had that dark fearful element of the empire. This and force awakens had all thought. I chuckled a few times and it felt fun, from one adventure to the next.",1
8019,7.0,"Let me start by saying that, overall, I liked this movie. The visuals were absolutely amazing, there were a ton of Easter eggs, and the cameos and throwbacks were a nice touch. Seeing Lando again was pretty cool, and the cgi with Leia was pretty seamless. It was nostalgic seeing the death star again too.<br /><br />With that being said, as an old star wars fan I'm left wanting more. I have more questions and disappointment than I do joy and closure.<br /><br />The writing on this was just lazy. Pretty much copy and paste from rotj with little originality.<br /><br />The whole palpatine plot actually angers me off because not only does it negate the whole story line of the first 6 movies, but it was a plot that just came out of nowhere, with no explanation of how he was resurrected. Anakin was the chosen one. He brought balance to the force by redeeming himself and killing the emperor. The fact that the emperor wasn't dead this whole time just means that Anakin's whole story was a sham?! Plus when the heck did palpatine have a chance to conceive a child?! I feel like it was all quickly put together just to be able to advertise that the emperor is back.<br /><br />The last Jedi last showed rose and Finn kissing, and they just abandoned that arc in this movie.<br /><br />The massive fleet was built on a planet that seems to have 0 resources and each ship is pretty much a death star?<br /><br />Rey is barely trained, and yet she is able to do things no other Jedi has ever been able to do. So I have to buy the fact that she is the most powerful Jedi to ever exist?! Nope. I love her character, but no.<br /><br />There was no character development, or any awe moments that made me relate to the characters.<br /><br />This whole trilogy lacked a good love story.<br /><br />And arguably the best thing about star wars is the lightsabers, particularly the battles. The lightsaber battles in this movie were absolutely horrible! Neither kylo nor Rey could use one for their life and they are supposed to be at the top of their game?! C'mon man!<br /><br />I could go on, but I think you get my point. This movie just left so much to be desired. Did I have fun watching it? Sure. I'll probably even watch it a few more times. Did I get that same gut wrenching feeling mixed with tears and excitement like I did watching Avengers endgmame? Absolutely not.<br /><br />I really wish they would have planned this trilogy better and kept the same director for all 3. Overall, Disney dropped the ball on this whole trilogy, leaving us all wanting so much more.",0

8022,9.0,A pouring of negative reviews and only a drop of positive reviews have soured this Star Wars film. It seems the fan base and critics are still divided by the left turn The Last Jedi took and the right turn The Rise of Skywalker took as if J.J and crew wanted to course correct the actions from The Last Jedi. Did it pay off though?,0
8023,8.0,"This is the best movie in the sequel trilogy. I could go on for a while about problems with the trilogy as a whole and the story arc from VII-IX, but if taken alone, this movie is a solid entry. It's fun and fast-paced with great sound and visuals. It fixes many of the problems with The Last Jedi. It concludes one saga while leaving plenty of space for future sequels with compelling stories. Some plot holes, some difficulties that come from trying to pick up the pieces from The Last Jedi, and a needless lesbian kiss ( don't try to teach my kids about human sexuality) knock it down to 9/10. But overall, if you like Star Wars, go see it, enjoy it for what it is, and hope that in the future, the lessons learned from this trilogy will pay off with stronger story arcs and better planned movie series. Star Wars could learn a lot from how Marvel plans their movies, and I think this trilogy will reinforce those lessons.",1

I give a 9/10 because the music and cinematography made this movie. It was visually stunning and honestly don't agree with everyone on the bad story telling. It wasn't great story telling but it wasn't the worst. It seems rushed at times, but by the time Rey meets with ol PALPS I'm all in. The final scenes of the movie are not wasted. The crazy amount of power Palatine had was INSANE. I honestly loved this movie. But I feel like I'm in the minority, and I'm okay with that.",0

This had so many funny moments between droids and creatures and of course the big main 3 characters. It felt so good to see them back together just like Han, Leia, and Luke. Palpatine was dope and powerful. The ending was worth the wait and showed how compassion is the true theme in Star Wars!",1

Finally we can all move on from this new trilogy. This movie is good, because it is action packed, exciting, beautiful, ties up loose ends, and isn't stupid like TLJ. But if you are truly a Star Wars fan you are doomed. This trilogy missed on so many storylines and misused the Star Wars Universe over and over again. If this trilogy was left up to the fans to write their would have been a whole lot more Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewy together and their wouldn't be the stupid new additions that went against the natural rules set forth in the original 6 movies.",0

Somehow it creates a theme that none can truly die yet they are dead - the whole thing seems like a 24 hour space adventure - many cliches which they make know what is going to happen from a milestone - kylo is built like a guy with parental issues and palpatine does nothing at all in the whole movie ( basically you don't have a villain ) . At the end of the film i only tried to see the reaction of the crowd and i felt relaxed that they were all dissatisfied .,0
8039,3.0,"Overall good movie. So many Star Wars movie have those cringe moments that make you think 'what were u thinking' (ie jar jar, anakin and padme's entire storyline in ep2, leia Superman space scene etc), this movie didn't have any of that. I suppose there was a lack of emotional connection to some of the story unlike Rogue one. But anyone that gives this movie a 1/10 already had their mind made up before seeing the movie.",1
8040,5.0,"I am a fan (not a super fan) of the Star Wars universe and I thought this movie was a lot of fun. While I do not believe the plot was ironed out completely; I do believe this film to be a satisfying ending to the saga. It has a ton of fan service, great special effects, amazing space battles, some fun lightsaber duels, a compelling inner conflict narrative, solid acting (especially from Adam Driver) and some shocking moments. The overall tone of the movie was dark, but one could always see a bit of light shining through. While not the best Star Wars film, it was a film that kept me interested, satisfied and hopeful for the future of the franchise!",1
8041,8.0,"It wasn't great, but it wasn't god-awful. I followed the plot along just fine, the actors were great, the effects were something beyond this world, but yes, there are many flaws. That doesn't mean it was terrible. Is it the worse of the sequel trilogy? Probably. I'll have to watch all three of them again to get the full effect. Is it the worse Star Wars film? Far from it. Unlike other Star Wars films, I was not even considering clocking out of the film. I did not get bored for a second while watching this film. I cannot say the same for Episode II.<br /><br />I will admit it when I say I'm a recent viewer of the Star Wars series. I never read the ""Extended Universe,"" I've only watched the films. I understand that if I did, maybe my review would look a lot different, but as it stands, I like the movie just fine. Is it a satisfying ending? Eh...<br /><br />It has its moments, but something is missing. It does feel like an ending, but something about it just seems...incomplete. Like there are way more questions that need to be answered.<br /><br />Speaking of answering questions, it does answer a few of them. I won't spoil the answers, but a question of lineage is finally answered. Quite abruptly at that. I was expecting the answer but not to have it just sprung up like that. Other than that, the fights are cool, the sad moments are sad (except for one at the end of the end fight, I do agree with people about that), and Star Wars still feels like Star Wars to me.",0
8042,8.0,"The pacing of the first half felt like Abrams was trying to fit an entire movie into the first hour, likely to salvage what was left from Rian Johnson's bungle of a second movie, which felt like a quarter of a movie stretched out over two hours. Unfortunately, the result was half the movie had zero pacing - it felt like scenes were being crammed in just for the sake of saying they happened, and scenes stopped instead of ended, which is to say it never felt like the end of a scene was a conclusion to any meaningful dialogue or emotion. It felt like I was watching the first half on fast forward, as there were never any pauses or drama, and there was zero nuance to scenes and interactions. There was almost no character development whatsoever - by the end I found myself not caring for a single character, old or new, and it didnt feel like anyone had meaningful relationships, rather, it felt like we were being TOLD characters liked or disliked each other, and not shown. There were also dozens of characters introduced who could have had potentially cool or unique influences on the plot, but then were thrown away almost immediately, either being killed in a fight, or just never appearing again. The second half of the movie was alright, and the effects were very cool, but it still felt incredibly disappointing as the finale to a trilogy, especially a Star Wars trilogy.",0
8043,7.0,"Walking into the theater to watch this film felt more like a chore than anything. The first 2 films in the new trilogy were incredible disappointments for me, especially The Last Jedi, so sitting down in my seat hurt inside. After all these years, I was positive that this film would only poor salt into the wound and would deal the final blow that would kill Star Wars as a franchise.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm saying this... but I was wrong. This movie brought the franchise back. It actually felt like I was watching a Star Wars film.<br /><br />They finally brought back what Star Wars was originally about: the importance of teamwork and family, good's rise over evil, and how your bloodline doesn't dictate your destiny. This film was filled to the brim in order to wrap up the story, and by the end it felt complete. It felt good. I was bawling, not out of anger, but out of satisfaction. They finally did it right and made it come full circle.<br /><br />Of course this film didn't come without flaws. From the beginning of the new trilogy, there were problems sewn into the story. They downgraded the power of the lightsaber, made Rey a sort of a Mary Sue, changed the power of the Force, and ruined Luke as a character. The new trilogy's problems had to inevitably bleed into this movie too. The pacing is atrocious and super fast paced. The editing was quick and needed constant attention from the audience in order to follow the story. In the end, I think this is forgivable. The Last Jedi was- in my opinion- terrible, with almost no use to the trilogy. The time it wasted had to be made up for, so TROS had to be stuffed to finish the story.<br /><br />I also think that this film solved some of the problems in the Last Jedi. Questions were answered, and some things were redeemed and fixed. It is such a relief. JJ built the foundation with TFA, Rian knocked it down with TLJ, and JJ picked up the pieces and filled in the blanks with TROS.<br /><br />There were some odd moments and some weird dialogue. But we shouldn't act like the people whi make Star Wars films must be gods. Even the original trilogy had script issues.<br /><br />So... to those who are overwhelmed with the negativity surrounding this film: don't listen to it. Go in blind, without expectations. Have an open mind and interpret it how you want to.<br /><br />It might seem impossible, but you just might like this one. It happened to me, and I'm happy. Trust me, as someone that avoids The Last Jedi like the plague I am surprised I liked The Rise of Skywalker. I hope that despite the hate, you like it too.",0
8044,3.0,It has a few plot twists that don't really make sense but what movie doesn't? Overall I think it was an amazing movie that met most of my expectations. I loved it!,1
8045,4.0,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away......alright maybe not that far away, back in 1977, amongst the films of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", a relatively unknown director called George Lucas created a vast leap forward in the world of special effects by creating the film we all know and love ""Star Wars"". Ever since then, along with advances in special effects, the universe of ""Star Wars"" has advanced leaps and bounds in what we understand a great movie to be.",1
8046,8.0,Visuals and music are very good. But story desisions and plotholes and the stupid ending line and the subtle but forced identity politics lower the quality of the film for me.,0
8047,8.0,"A great end movie for the 9 movie series! It has everything a fan could want if you've been following the journey since a New Hope or are just a casual movie goer. People should get over George Lucas selling Star Wars, female leads, storyline twists, and their political obsession. See the movie to have fun and to enjoy the Star Wars experience! Great story, action, and, production. Worth seeing again. Fanboys need not apply.",1
8048,7.0,"Look, I did enjoy this film. Anyway, the first half was a bit too much of adding things up, but the 2nd half was brilliant, full throttle action Star Wars... though, it was effectively Return Of The Jedi, but what more can you do with good vs evil and when you re-introduce the archest of all enemies to the scene?!",1
8049,9.0,"The unsure footings in the first two, esp much more so in TLJ are no more in this finale. We went to watch as a family and my teenager sons don't know Star Wars at all. But fans or not, one can surely feel the plot and enjoy the epic scenes. One can even feel the intricate relationships between the characters even if you did not watch a single Star Wars film before. That is no mean feat for the script writer and the director.<br /><br />And Rey is just so telling with her eyes!<br /><br />The film is just well balance between epic actions and storytelling! Well done!",0
8050,7.0,"After my disappointment with ""The Last Jedi,"" and then reading some early naysayer's reviews for this film, I was very worried this would be a disappointment as well. But I think J.J. got it right! I thought it was fun, exciting , well written, and well acted.",0
8051,9.0,Very fun Star Wars film with some scenes of comedy and some very good action scenes.,1
8052,8.0,"I remember seeing A New Hope with my Dad in the theater. Then many times after that when it appeared on TV and then VHS etc. I've followed it all and 40 years later, I still love these movies. I think what makes people so crazy is that they seem to be expecting an Oscar worthy film that's never meant to be that way in the first place. It's pure fantasy entertainment and when you look at it from that perspective it just works. It did for me anyway. I was satisfied that they answered all the critical questions. Some things dont need a feasible or even a great explanation. It just is what it is. Acting was great. The cinematography was stellar. There were many awesome moments that brought back the magic. Loved the ending. The one thing that was very out of place was the lesbian kiss at the ending celebration. Totally took me out of the story and was like a wet blanket, honestly. Im not down on LGB, but this moment didnt have a place in this story, was obviously shoehorned in by special interest groups, and it was jarring. It's clear the direction that Disney is going sooner rather than later. Conservative parents, be advised. Other than that, great movie. Almost perfect.",1
8053,8.0,"Alright now I get why hardcore fans are mad about it and keep in mind that I walked into this with somewhat low expectations considering all the mixed feelings people are having but I still very much enjoyed it! Sure it has its flaws as all movies do and one of them being that the first half feels pretty rushed, pretty much every line of dialogue in the first 30 minutes is of exposition but despite that I still think it had a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga",1
8054,9.0,"First of all, I am a big fan, but not a die-hard one of Star Wars. I don't have big problems with the prequel triology as the Phantom Menace was the first movie that I watched as a 6-year-old boy and it made me interested in the whole Star Wars world. So my assumption is different from those who think that the only good Star Wars is the original triology.",1
8055,8.0,Very well written. Action packed. Good cinematography. Great acting. It's one of the best titles in the series. They definitely put a sour spin at the end when they feature a homosexual kiss.,1
8056,8.0,I can't believe people are actually giving this 1/10..maybe people need attention? I can't imagine anyone sitting through this movie and not enjoying it. I can't wait to watch it again!,0
8057,9.0,"I think, that despite the fact that in some points it's the same old story and it's a bit forced somewhere else, it gave me goosebumps in the key moments. I really apreciated this movie. Maybe it's not the star wars George Lucas had in mind but in my opinion this movie is well done in all fields",1
