0,5.0,"Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.",0
1,7.0,"Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox",1
2,9.0,"While it received generally positive reviews upon its release, and captured the imaginations of an entire generation of younglings, The Phantom Menace has garnered an almost toxic reputation on the internet in the years since. Sure, it's not a perfectly structured film, and yes, there are more than a few dopey decisions, but the sheer spectacle and sense of fun in Star Wars: Episode I cannot be denied. George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire.",1

4,4.0,"The main line of defence seems to be: lighten up, it's just entertainment / just a kid's movie / just a special effects flick.  Pausing awhile to note that people who run this line of defence have all but conceded that the film is, in fact, bad, let's take these points one by one - shall we?",0

6,8.0,"Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways. ",1
7,7.0,"What everyone remembers fondly from this movie is Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul and their climatic duel. Sadly, there isn't more than a few minutes of Maul and instead we are given Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd as a needlessly young Anakin. Along with these characters the movie is burdened by a general tone that's directed at children and an over reliance on still developing CGI technology.",0
8,8.0,"'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. A movie, which has a difficult standing in the fan community. For me, not understandable, because I really like the movie and it's a successful prelude to the formerly new trilogy.",0
9,10.0,"I know it's fashionable to scorn the ""prequel"" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare ""Phantom Menace"" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.",1
10,4.0,"Let's face the awful truth. You don't even need to watch the film to see what is going on. You can just listen to - or for that matter just read the lyrics of - Weird Al Yankovic's ""The Saga Begins"" and you have seen the movie. Besides impressive special effects and good acting from a stellar cast there is nothing to see here people, move along.I say good acting because it is not the cast's fault they were given mundane dialogue and thus portrayed characters I just did not care about. The only interesting idea brought up here not brought up in the original trilogy is that fear in sufficient amounts is necessary for survival, but in excess it can destroy a person. And that it is possible for a nine year old boy to hit on a fourteen year old girl and have a shot AFTER puberty. That's it, that's all. It's not a menace, but this film is definitely a phantom of the first two Star Wars films and maybe even of the third, which was also a step down in quality in my humble opinion.",0
11,8.0,"For 6 months I longed to watch Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and for 133 minutes I was absolutely blown away with how well the movie was put together.  I saw it on opening day of course, and I now understand why I have waited so long to write a review of it.  If I had written this review right after I watched the movie, I would have written a review influenced by the months and months of anticipation.  I feel now, after 17 months and countless 1000's of times watching all or some of the movie, I now feel that I can review this film free of influence.",0
12,9.0,"I loved this movie as a kid. I still love it at age 21. Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you.",1
13,10.0,"I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time when I was 5 years old, and I remember being blown away by what I had watched. It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.",1

15,7.0,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is written, produced and directed by George Lucas and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ian McDiarmid. The fourth film released in the Star Wars franchise, it is, however, the first of three prequels that lead up to Star Wars that was released in 1977. Plot basically follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and his apprentice padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), who escort and protect Queen Amidala (Portman) from Naboo to Coruscant in the hope of finding peace as an interplanetary trade dispute starts to boil over. During the journey the party stops over at Tatooine and encounter a young boy named Anakin Skywalker.

17,8.0,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, is a beautiful opening to perhaps one of the most beautiful space sagas of all-time!! This was George Lucas' attempt to set the stage, and place the characters that would eventually lead to the characters that we grew to know and love in the late 1970's and early 1980's. Now expectations for this film were EXTREMELY high when it was coming out in early 1999, and not everyone liked this film but this reviewer was not one of those people. I was one of the the people that loved it. For the most part, Lucas was given a blank check by Twentieth Century Fox to make this film and if you are to watch it again and just take in the landscapers, settings, costumes, technology, you will see the grand vision that Lucas had behind The Phantom Menace. He did not have these funds and technology at his disposal for his first three Star Wars films. This time he simply did not spare any expense in the prequel films. Israeli-American actress, and Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman changes through numerous costumes in the film, one better than the the other as does her entourage in costumes that are not that far off in terms of looks or expenses from Portman's. I can understand how some fans might be upset at how there are some slow scenes in the film, but it was important for Lucas to set up future action scenes - not to mention future movies - such as the scene where Qui-Gon Jinn (played admirably by Liam Neeson) takes a blood sample from young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to get a midi-chlorian count (a Jedi blood count - something that lets Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan - played very well by Ewan McGregor - know he has Jedi potential). Lucas makes up for this though with outstanding action scenes later in the movie like the desert fight scene between the black clad ninja-like Sith warrior Darth Maul (Ray Park) and Qui-Gon in which the two clash sabers for a couple minutes before Qui-Gon wisely jumps to his ship and the safety of space!! The fact that Star Wars was back, and it was done in a satisfying way that set up future movies was good enough for me!! It had memorable characters, and while not all of these characters survived, they made an imprint on the Star Wars universe that Star Wars fans still cherish today!! Great action, fair acting, good costuming, good sound editing, great soundtrack by legend and genius John Williams, good direction and writing by God and legend George Lucas made this the most artistically beautiful and fun movie of the Star Wars saga!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",1
18,9.0,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was probably one of the most anticipated movie of the last couple of decades. Because of the whole hype around it, it could only disappoint and it was no surprise that lot's of people eventually were disappointed. I have to admit that even I was disappointed a bit. The first time I saw it in the cinema I would had probably rated it a 7/10 but the second time I saw it in the cinema (yes, a real Star Wars fan doesn't watch a Star Wars movie just once in cinema :P), I already began to appreciate it more. It really is a movie that grows onto you. I'm now at the point were I'm loving this movie and see it as a great addition to the Star Wars saga. Granted that it's not the perfect beginning of the series but it certainly is a entertaining and beautiful movie. If this would had been the first Star Wars movie that had been made, I'm sure it would had been received way better than it did now. ",1

20,10.0,STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE. cue the John Williams theme music. George Lucas gives us a fantastic look at how the story begins.We meet Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi We see the beginning of the Empire in the way events are manipulated the story unfolds in it's own time nothing is rushed. every thing means something and it blends together beautifully. Liam Neeson is simply the whole movie Darth Maul's evil look might've been a publicist's dream but Qui gon jinn is the heart of the movie and Ewen Macgregor simply wonderful as Kenobi. The movie never earned all the basing it got it's about as wonderful a time as you will ever have reliving your childhood or watching a grand adventure movie. The Phantom menace is one of the best in this genre .,1
21,8.0,"""THX 1138"" director George Lucas' ""Stars Wars"" prequel ""Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" accomplishes four crucial objectives in the franchise. First, it presents the origins of Luke's father Anakin Skywalker, who will eventually deviate to the dark side as Darth Vader. Second, it introduces Queen Amidala who will be Anakin's bride in later episodes, and give birth to Luke. Third, it shows us Obi-Wan Kenobi during his youth as a Jedi. Finally, it let us meet Palpatine later mutates into the dreaded Emperor. Everybody loves to trash this exotic looking piece of space opera, but it provides solid entertainment even if it takes most of its cues from Lucas' original. Liam Neeson gives the film its sense of gravitas, and he serves the same purpose for Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan that the elder Obi-Wan gave Luke Skywalker in ""Star Wars."" Of course, everybody complained about comic relief character Jar Jar Binks. He isn't as obnoxious if you watch the film enough. Eventually, the Fanboys may rehabilitate the prequel trilogy. Mind you, as with all prequels, you know in advance who is going to make the cut, so suspense is compromised from the outset. The special effects are trippy as usual, and John Williams' orchestral score is fantastic. Like ""Star Wars,"" ""The Phantom Menace"" conjures up all manner of creatures. Eventually, the inhabitants of one planet must set aside their differences and join together to whip the outsiders. Apart from stalwarts like Neeson and McGregor, Natalie Portman makes a strong impression as a take-charge kind of gal. ""Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" is entertaining enough to keep you distracted throughout its running time.",1
22,10.0,"When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",1
23,10.0,"What fun I had at this movie!  The whole experience, from the crowd cheering and excitement as the words ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the music, the opening scenes as Qui Gon and Obi Won battled the droids, to the escape of Queen Amidala, to the pod racing, to the unleashing of Darth Maul, to the climatic fight, etc., etc.!  This was a great time.  I hear some complain that it wasn't anything like the first Star Wars, A New Hope.  Well, of course not!  Had it been, everyone would have complained that all they did was try to recapture the magic of the first movie!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, any age, anywhere!",1

25,9.0,"As much as I like episodes 4,5,6 this one lives up to them being the prequel I finally got to see what started the saga. I also liked it because of the special effects and the characters and it also had a story to it the movie wasnt just about the special effects.",1
26,9.0,"This movie, the most hyped movie of all time, has been put under the microscope and looked at in a variety of different ways. It seems that everyone had prejudged the movie before it was even released, and then strutted about claiming that they told you that it would be that way. There was the die-hards, who were impossible to dissapoint. There were of course the disenchanted and the unimpressible, who probably would not had conceeded the movie was good no matter what. There were the people who acted as if this movie symbolized their disapproval of media hype itself, and by principle decided to dislike the film. Looking over the other comments I see the opposing viewpoints clearly. OK, the movie was overhyped, but what do you expect in 1999, the year of hype? I was four years old when the A New Hope came out, and of course, I loved it. I was four, and a science fiction epic can have its way with a boy of that age. I think many people in the 20-35 age group expected to have that same life changing event that happened to them twenty years ago this time around. That is the equivalent of going to Disney World for the first time since you were a kid and being let down: Did you expect the impact to be the same? Take the movie for what it is. OK, it isn't just any movie, but it behaved like one, with strong points and weak ones as well. First the strong points.",1

However the evil Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson) is ordered to kill the Jedis and invade Naboo. However the Jedis escape and Qui-Gon saves the life of the clumsy Gungan Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). The outcast native takes the Jedis to his submerged city and the Gungan leader gives transportation to them. The Jedis head to the capital to warn Queen Amidala about the invasion. However she has been captured by the Federation droids but the Jedis rescue the queen and her court and they flee in a spacecraft that is damaged when they cross the blockade. They land in a desert planet and Qui-Gon Jinn goes to the town with Jar Jar, the droid R2-D2 and the queen's assistant Padmé (Natalie Portman) to seek the necessary part for the spacecraft. When they find the component, they do not have money to buy it. But the slave boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) offers to dispute a race with his pod to raise the necessary money. Qui-Gon feels the Force in the boy and accepts his offer. Will the boy win the race? What will happen to Naboo/? Will Queen Amidala be capable to convince the politicians to release her planet from the Federation Trade?",1
28,9.0,"After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas's story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn't disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won't bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it's about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It's obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don't do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He's just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the ""Phantom Menace"" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can't wait for Episode II!",1
29,6.0,"Because I haven't talked about a Star Wars movie in over a year at this point, I figure it's time I get back to business. I have to admit though, I'm reluctant to talk about the Star Wars prequels as they will never live up to the reputations of the originals in most people's eyes. I decided to rewatch and review this one however because not only is it the chronological beginning of the film series, but also because it's a pretty controversial and polarizing movie to talk about. There really is no sweet spot for this movie, enjoyment wise. People either love it or hate it, but now that it's over 2 decades old and all the hype is long gone, we can examine it for what it truly is without our judgement being obscured by unreasonable expectations. Like always I'll start by explaining the storyline, which is quite complex as it needed to lay the framework for the rest of the series. The story begins by telling us that an interstellar shipping conglomerate known as the Trade Federation has taken a step towards going to war with the Galactic Republic by surrounding the planet of Naboo with large amounts of droid control ships and other vehicles. The Republic sends two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi (Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor respectively) to try and negotiate with the leader of the Federation, Viceroy Nute Gunray. However, Gunray's boss, the scheming Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid), tells him not to speak with the Republic and to launch a full scale invasion of Naboo instead. A ship sent to reach an agreement with the Federation is blown up, and Qui-Gon (along with his apprentice) escape to Naboo onboard an enemy transport ship. Later, Qui-Gon saves a native of Naboo named Jar Jar Binks who leads them to the ruler of Naboo, Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). All of them go into temporary exile using her personal starship, intent on making it to Coruscant; a planet made up entirely of cities. Unfortunately, the ship is damaged in a skirmish with Federation forces and the part of the ship responsible for making the jump to hyperspace is damaged, meaning they can't make the trip just yet. The ship is forced to land on a desert planet called Tatooine, which has two suns. All the characters, along with one of the ship's droids (R2-D2) pile out and try to find a replacement hyperdrive. They eventually come across a merchant named Watto who is the owner of a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Anakin seems to be an unusually intelligent and resourceful kid for someone his age, and Qui-Gon senses this through the Force. He speaks with his mother, Shmi, about his origins, and she says she simply became pregnant with him. Qui-Gon is convinced Anakin will grow up to be an incredibly powerful warrior who will stabilize the Force and make things right. He decides to enter him in a very dangerous sports tournament, known as podracing, in order to win enough money to repair the ship's hyperdrive. Even at his young age, Anakin seems to be able to see things before they even happen; a Jedi characteristic that allows him to win the race while many of the other contestants end up dead. Watto is forced to honor his end of the bargain, and also releases Anakin from slavery. Anakin says a very sad goodbye to his mother, but promises to come back for her when he's strong enough one day. Meanwhile, Darth Maul, Sidious' protige, arrives on Tatooine looking for Amidala. As her ship is about to take off for Coruscant, Qui-Gon is ambushed by him and almost killed. After escaping to Coruscant, Amidala tries to beg for the Galactic Senate to help her planet, but corruption there is rife. Qui-Gon also announces to the Jedi Council that he wants to train Anakin, as he is convinced he is the subject of a prophecy. Master Yoda refuses, almost certain that the boy will get corrupted somewhere down the line. After flying back to Naboo, Padme knows she will probably be arrested and forced to sign a deal with the Federation to legalize the invasion of her planet, but she is able to form an alliance with the alien race known as the Gungans instead. Jar Jar, being one himself, is allowed to lead the gungan army in a battle against Federation droids and assault vehicles. While all this is going on, Qui-Gon and the others are in the palace of Theed (Naboo's capital) looking for Gunray. Anakin joins the space battle in a starfighter, managing to get inside the droid control ship and destroy its reactor by himself, which shuts down all the robotic infantry fighting the gungans. Maul, also in the Theed palace, has an intense lightsaber skirmish with Qui-Gon and Kenobi, which results in the former being fatally wounded after he's separated from his ally. Kenobi kills Maul, and promises to a dying Qui-Gon that he will make sure Anakin fulfills his destiny. Finally, Yoda begrudgingly allows Obi-Wan to train Anakin, and Naboo celebrates its victory over the Federation. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but this movie really does deserve its rather unenviable reputation. After rewatching it, I can now conclude that it is mediocre primarily because it seems (to me) to put special effects above everything else, and the effects themselves have no magic. Everything looks like it's straight out of a video game. While virtually every single shot in this film has some kind of dazzling effect, this advantage is also the film's biggest weakness. The old Star Wars movies had awesome miniatures that allowed the filmmakers to generate special effects in creative ways, and it actually took lots of effort. With this movie, you can just tell it was all done on a computer. I didn't really care for the characters either. Maybe it was endearing seeing C-3PO and R2 meet for the first time, but the vast majority of characters are dull or even outright obnoxious. Jar Jar is so hated in the Star Wars community he's actually become a meme. I don't need to comment anything else. Qui-Gon is mostly 2 dimensional throughout the whole ordeal, and Obi-Wan just seemed to annoy me with how much he tags behind him. I know it's his job being an apprentice, but still. Young Anakin is also irritating, which can be partially excused because he's a kid, but I just wanted to see him hurry up and turn into Vader already. Darth Maul had barely any screen time, but his double bladed lightsaber and threatening appearance are a definite highlight here. I think we can all agree though that the music is great and that John Williams always delivers, with the song that plays during the lightsaber duel (Duel of the Fates) being among the best. Like I said earlier, I hate the fact that I have to (mostly) dislike this movie. It has great special effects, a killer soundtrack, impressive action scenes, but it's ultimately let down by its convoluted plot and forgettable characters: the things that matter most. Not to mention it basically ruined the magical aura surrounding the Force by explaining how it works biologically via someone's cells. Maybe it's good Lucas isn't in charge of these movies anymore.",1
30,5.0,"This isn't a terrible film. However, the decision of scrapping models and make-up for CGI.. distanced this film from the original trilogy both chronologically and in it's impact. Of course there are those that will say that 'technology has come along' ...or that, ""if you have it, why don't you use it?"".... problem is ...the old films still don't seem dated.....and the minimalized action scenes of the first trilogy still hold up EXTREMELY well.... so changing the formula didn't improve things... Considering this film had such a monumental task(cont. the series/intro to new characters), I found these changes in production completely separated the new trilogy from it's predecessors even further... This film is supposed to have been BEFORE Star Wars.....years before....I find that MANY elements of the film seem 'LIGHT YEARS AHEAD'...it quite honestly...makes no sense whatsoever to do this. It's like Lucas gave his geek squad free reign and decided that the original formula was outdated and would take too long to make......It's not like he didn't have the money....BUT IT IS LIKE he didn't have the time. Jar Jar Binks made the film feel more like a Sesame St. episode than a prequel to one of the greatest trilogies in modern film. Standing on it's own....this is an average action film...standing next to Star Wars and Empire....this is one of the biggest disappointments in my movie-going life. ....and the fact that Lucas has now fuddled with the original series proves that he has lost his touch. The escalated action scenes with their over-use of CGI and the distant characters have somehow made this less personal...less of an adult action movie.....and in the end ...less of a film. 48/100",0
31,8.0,"This film was actually really good, and I can't believe some of the reviews it got. While it's not my favorite Star Wars film(Return of the Jedi holds that title), it's still pretty high up there. First, let me just say that I don't get why so many people hated JarJar Binks. He didn't annoy me at all, and I found him to be a funny, worthwhile character who played an important role in helping to defeat the evil Trade Federation. I only had two big problems with this film: 1.Darth Maul was a wasted character, which is a real pity. He could have been an awesome villain if he had appeared in more scenes and been given more lines, instead of only being in a few scenes and having three or four lines. 2. Obi-Wan did not have as big of a part as he could have had, and he should have at least accompanied Qui-Gon to Tatooine. I just felt that Ewan Mcgregor's fine acting skills were wasted.Other than that, though, I liked this movie. The film's best performances came from Liam Neeson and Jake LLoyd. Ian McDiarmid also did quite well as the suave, sinister Senator Palpatine. John Williams did an excellent job composing the film's music. I particularly enjoyed Duel of the Fates(the intense, fast- paced composition played during the climactic lightsaber battle between Darth Maul and the two Jedi) and also the festive, light-hearted music played during the final victory parade.Basically, I just really liked Episode I, and I look forward to seeing Episode II next Spring!",1

Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous. These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are. For those who say he raped your childhood, well, I guess that sucks for you, but let those who aren't little babies enjoy these. Another solid addition to the Star Wars franchise. 9/10",0

I know that a lot of people out there disagree with me on that, but all of the little problems a lot of people have with the plot can be explained with a little thought, and I believe that GL really thought everything through -- he just didn't tell us the whole story.

Unfortunately we all have to wait too long for the next two episodes...",1
49,4.0,"A friend of mine brought over his unopened collectors edition copy of  STAR WARS:  EPISODE 1, THE PHANTOM MENACE.  Unlike most people, I hadn't bothered to see the film in theaters.  Prequels are generally inferior (BUTCH AND SUNDANCE:  THE EARLY YEARS, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, etc.). Sadly, THE PHANTOM MENACE is no exception.  In fact, it is one of the most insipid knockoffs I've ever seen.  Even Roland Emmerich did it better with INDEPENDENCE DAY.  At least THAT movie had some genuinely striking visuals (the White House exploding comes immediately to mind). What's wrong with THE PHANTOM MENACE?  Let's start with the dialogue.  Much of it is unintelligible, EVEN AMONG THE HUMAN ACTORS.  That wouldn't be so bad if so much of the story wasn't dependent upon dialogue.  The pacing is flat-footed, at least during the first third.  The undersea ride is about as exciting, suspenseful and realistic as the submarine ride at Disneyworld. Unlike the originals, the entire film is shot at the 6th grade level. Even a good Disney movie has more pain. Unlike Darth Vader, Darth Maul has no personality, or even any dialogue. He's more like the typical Ninja in an Asian martial arts movie.  And, speaking of Asians, the movie also includes some ugly stereotyping.  The evil but stupid Viceroy and his aide have flat faces and noses and speak English with an obvious Asian accent. WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD. So Natalie Portman's played a `double.'  Wow, what a surprise.  Didn't this kind of plot element become old hat after THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER? Certainly, it's been used by every soap opera on TV. Reducing Annakin's spiritual connection with `the Force' to simple physiological phenomena devalues the series' mysticism and begs a simple question.  Why not blood test EVERYBODY?  Annakin's penetration of the droid control ship was, quite simply, stupid, relying WAY too much on coincidence.  The pod race was so predictable I was half expecting to see Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly among the contestants. Most surprisingly, the WORST thing about the movie were the effects.  I would have PREFERRED men in rubber masks and alien suits to the phony-looking CGI characters and scenery.  Want to see how it's done right? Witness the crowds watching the TITANIC depart, or the British Redcoats in THE PATRIOT.  Guess what?  Same effects firm (Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic).",0
50,10.0,"Many people considers this film disappointing, I don't think so, it's a great movie. I've read some other comments and some of them were saying that one the biggest disappointments was cosed by a new characters. I liked the new characters like Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar Jar and others. But the best one was Darth Maul, though he wasn't talking much, but that actually made him more mysterious. The action was much better than in previous films and there was more of it. I liked the sword fight between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan (played by Ewan McGregor, It was kinda weird to see Rent-boy fighting droids with a light sword) and Qui-Gon. Some people were also disappointed that Anakin Skywalker was just a little boy in this film, but it was better this way. It was kinda funny to watch him as a kid when you already know who he will become.",1
51,4.0,"I'll always remember The Phantom Menace for the podracing. I played the Nintendo game for more hours than I can count, so for nostalgia alone I can't outright dislike this movie. It's great looking for sure. The lush environments and set designs are excellent, as is the appearance of Darth Maul - possibly the most underused character in the entire franchise. But the actual meat of the movie - the plot, the characters, the flow - is an absolute mess. It's like a McDonald's meal. It gives you temporary satisfaction and looks appealing at first, but there's no substance and ultimately leaves you feeling guilty and disappointed. ",0
52,9.0,Forget all the negative hype! Many were expecting another Star Wars or ROTJ with a wise-cracking Han Solo character playing off a beautiful princess. Episode 1 is about style and visuals. Lucas sacrificed character development and intelligent character interplay with amazing visuals that will blow you away! I'll take the hyperspeed Pod racing scene over Solo/Lea flirting any day. ,1
53,7.0,"Although it looks amazing I found The Phantom Menace to be hugely disappointing, the story was poor and it just didn't feel like a Star Wars film. The best part by far was an amazing battle between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. The worst by far was Jar Jar Binks, an awful, annoying, totally unfunny character. Ewen MacGregor was good as Obi Wan Kenobi but wasn't given much to do, Liam Neeson was very good also as was the child actor who played Anakin Skywalker. Natalie Portman wasn't so great though, showing little of the promise she showed in Leon. It was great to see R2D2 and C3PO again though and as you would expect the special effects were amazing including an astounding pod race sequence. Yoda was back too alongside Samuel L Jackson playing the part of a Jedi. I pray Episode II is better than this ***7/10*",0

I knew who was in it but that was about it. However it was hard to avoid all the negative information that was spreading. As much as I tried I knew that this film was largely not well liked. This didn't bother me after all it was Star Wars, how bad could it be? I went to the cinema in anticipation and sat down. Then it started.

60,8.0,"In light of the completion of the Star Wars saga with Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is probably due for a re-evaluation. While by no means anywhere near as good as the original trilogy, neither is it really that bad a film. After all, it's still Star Wars! The one overwhelming criticism of Episode I is the presence of one Jar Jar Binks. A computer generated amphibian with possibly the most irritating and child-like character and almost unintelligible voice in the history of cinema, with the possible exception of Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod in 'The Fifth Element'. Jar Jar is merely a walking talking marketing device aimed squarely at children. It is he who is the main cause of irritation for the die-hard fans. But also the lack of action, and the slightly over-long podrace also drew complaints, which reeked of a set-up or plug for a computer game (which of course appeared at the time of the film's release). Further, the plot was rather heavy on talking and politic scenes, causing the plot to slightly drag, and Lucas's over-reliance on computer generated scenery at times prove slightly nauseating for the viewer.",0

In the company of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, two truly excellent trained actors, Natalie Portman sounds as if she's reading her lines off the side of a cereal box. Also, I think the only correct application of computer-generated effects in movies is as inconspicuous set elements, or perhaps to simulate something passing by which doesn't require the viewer to pay attention. Having a prominent supporting role filled by a being which only exists in a circuit board is an insult to the viewer. Each of the original 3 films made me want to see the next one in the series; this film made me NOT want to see the next one.",1

67,6.0,"OK, I really liked episodes 4 - 6, inspite of the fact that they are  quite corny and have a lot of plot holes. This movie, although it  doesn't differ TOO much from the previous three in terms of story  (which is still full of holes) and it falls short of the other Star  Wars movies in every other aspect.  The casting is reasonable, I suppose, but the script really doesn't  allow for much character interaction. Dialogues in this movie are silly  or just downright inappropriate. For example, when the monster that  chases the submarine carrying our heroes gets eaten by another monster,  all Liam Neeson can say is ""there's always a bigger fish"". What  nonsense !  Also, the first three movies didn't take themselves too seriously. To  continue this tradition, George Lucas probably decided to include  Jar-Jar Binks, who is without a doubt the most annoying character ever  to appear in any movie. The result of this dubious choice is a movie  filled with jokes that are probably funny to five year old kids.   Most of the movie's action sequences also lack any kind of tension,  probably because the main characters are put to series after series of  highly dangerous events without one of them even getting scratched. The  only memorable series are the pod-race and the last fight between Darth  Maul and the Jedis.   The special effects in this movie are great, but everything else seems  to have been dumbed down in order to make the movie more accessible to  kids, thus ensuring the sale of more action figures and other rubbish.  It's not a total loss because there's still a bit of that ""Star Wars  Magic"" in this movie, but overall ""the Phantom Menace"" is more of a  two-hours commercial then a real movie  *1/2 out of ****",0
68,6.0,"I still remember the first time I tried to watch this movie. I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this. But still, it turned out okay, could've been better, but it's not the worst in the series. The worst in my opinion comes after this, with Attack of the Clones. But I'm not gonna say much about it here, I'll leave that for it's own review.",0

Many people will have gone into the cinema with a feeling of dread. It must have been a shame therefore that their fears were proved right. Episode I of these prequels is an abomination and a travesty to the world of ""Star Wars"" badly written by George Lucas, it's one redeeming grace is the occasional decent performance by it's actors. Sadly though it is such a childish and uncomfortable film that it really should never have been released.",0

74,8.0,"I just rewatched Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace today as a 24 year old, after first seeing it as about a 10 year old. I genuinely enjoyed watching it and especially loved seeing the beginnings of the Star Wars franchise's plot unfold. I'm not ashamed to say I cried at one part, the progression of the story of Anakin growing up as a slave, being recognized as an almost force of nature so strongly connected to the force, being encouraged to leave his planet and mother to be trained, and ultimately starting his path of pain and sorrow. I think Qui-Gon did not foresee Anakin having such a difficult life and wanted to believe he would bring balance rather than pain to the galaxy. However, Anakin's life never really having stability and his desires to be having never being met hit me hard, I'm not joking. The Star Wars franchise can indeed be entitled ""The Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker,"" and this movie The Phantom Menace sets the plot up so well that Anakin had to go through so much struggle to bring balance and it was difficult to digest imagining that he was *destined* to suffer almost, willed by the Force to destroy the Sith even by helping destroy the Jedi Order and what would inhibit the Jedi from ever defeating the Sith. Watching the movie unfold and observing how Darth Sidious tried to manipulate, successfully, nearly all the events that took place was incredible. I give major points to George Lucas and his, I assume, team of writers, I believe they did a great job in crafting the story. As for Anakin's acting, I'm surprised to say I thought it was good for his place. He is a ~10 year old child and I think for a child actor, he did an extremely good job. I liked the scenes most of all between Anakin and Qui-Gon, he seriously listened and learned from Qui-Gon which most children may not do. I give the film an 8/10, it deserves it, definitely for that last fight scene...probably the best fight scene in all of Star Wars, for myself anyways. Obi-Wan having that energy in his lightsaber duel with Darth Maul after Qui-Gon was nearly dead was amazing, GREAT choreography! Sick~ Long story short: this was a good movie ^^",1

Everything else still works on that gorgeous new star-cruiser, so just trade it even-up for an ugly ship with a working hyper-drive. Oh that's right  there's no hurry. Your planet's just being overrun by evil aliens. Did they take a submarine through the center of the planet? I won't even allow for that possibility with futuristic alien technology. That was just a ridiculous pretext for showing an underwater sea monster. So why not just land next to the city and save the sea odyssey? Same goes for the invaders. Why did it take so long for spaceships ALREADY IN ORBIT from the beginning of the movie to attack the city? There was just no logical sense of timing or urgency. Also, they should have let Darth Maul live. I liked him. But Jar-Jar Binks could have been eliminated completely. Not only was he a ridiculous, pathetic, annoying racial stereotype, and looked too much like Ally McBeal with a green suntan, but he was hard to understand. Not that he said anything worth listening to. Am I the only person in the world who looks at computer animation and sees a cheap cartoon? Most of the movie looked more like a video game than a feature film. Oh, and if you're fighting a monster that will be added in later using computer magic and you want it to look convincing, your eyes should focus about 2 or 3 feet in front of you, not on the cue card guy 30 feet away. It makes it seem like you're talking to a ghost. They should make another Star Wars 1  The Adjustment. In this movie, we pretend that the Phantom Menace never happened and are treated to a real Star Wars movie, exploding Death Star and all! Hey, I can wish, can't I?

Because like many Star Wars fans my expectations weren't so high that nothing could meet them. The effects in this movie were incredible. The worlds created: Tatooine's other cities, Naboo's large city, underwater city and Coruscant were eye popping wonders...worlds I've never been to before. The acting was fine...no Star Wars film is ever going to match Shakespearean productions (thank God for that!). The story moved along fast with expert pacing. It was not boring by any stretch of the imagination and those who say it was would be bored on a trip to the moon! What were people expecting? I felt George Lucas delivered and I know when the next two are finished we'll all agree that the man is a genius! Quit being so hard on this film and enjoy it.

89,1.0,"I can't believe how complete awful The Phantom Menace was! This film had no plot, originality, or storyline. The film had the most BORING characters with the exception of Jar Jar Binks who is quite possibly the most annoying, childish, and irritating character ever to be shown on a big screen. ",0
90,1.0,"This movie was crap, and I really mean crap. What was Lucas thinking having Anakin as a little boy? I remember the stories that Obi-wan told about how he first met Anakin to Luke during the original trilogy.",0
91,10.0,"What more can be said about this movie?   It was incredible and extremely fun.  As both a movie fan and a Star Wars fan I was blown away by this film. For that reason, I feel I must reply to some of the criticisms I've read about this film.  There was one person on this page who put it best in saying that anybody that disliked this movie just does not know how to have fun.  I think that is true and is a shame, because the same people who loved the original movies as kids 20 years ago have now grown up into cold-hearted, pedantic nit-pickers more interested in having a religious experience at the movies than having fun.  This movie was fun and captivating.  Many people have said that there was not much of a plot. That could not be more untrue.  There is a great plot filled with political intrigue.  Many people have said there is no character development.  The whole movie is spent developing Anikin, who is supposed to be the main focus of these three films.  Many people criticized young Jake Lloyd's performance, which I thought was excellent.  I've even heard people criticize Natalie Portman's performance, and she was incredible in this film.  People have compared this film to Episode 4, saying it did not have the heart or was not as good.  Come on, Episode 4 was a bad movie... it was hoaky and cheesy and campy and that was what made it great.  You cannot compare the two films. You've got different characters, different actors, different technology, different times, and different movies.  If you want to see the same old movie, then just stay home and watch the original trilogy on tape.  I've also seen the term Star Wars ""purist"" thrown around and you can basically through that out the window.  IT'S A MOVIE!!!! And in addition to that, it's a SCI-FI/FANTASY movie.  Things are not supposed to make sense or be perfect.  It's just supposed to be fun and entertaining.  This movie delivers.  The special effects are beyond anything ever seen before, the characters are very likeable, the action sequences are intense and incredible, and I LIKED JAR JAR BINKS!!!!  If liking Jar Jar means I'm like a 6 year old, then I'm happy because the whole point of going to  the movies is to just have fun.  This movie pulls you into an incredible world and keeps you enthralled throughout.  The end lightsaber battle contains some of the best sequences ever put on film and is worth the price of admission on its own.  Don't analyze this movie by comparing it to other films. Analyze what the events of this film mean to the world of Star Wars.  Picking on this film is like criticizing the Mona Lisa because she's not smiling. Get real, get a grip, go see this movie, and enjoy it because it really is something special.  And if you leave the theater wanting more then you've got the point.  You're supposed to want more, that's why you go see the next movie.  Just go and enjoy this film, it's really excellent.",1

I love this film can be watched as a solo Star Wars story with a beginning and end. With the exception of the childishly written Jar Jar Binks, I adore these characters - Qui Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala, Darth Maul, and Obi Wan Kenobi are all amazing creations. The return to the planet of Tatooine to explore Darth Vader's childhood is very interesting and the addition of the beautiful planet Naboo and the towering cityscape of Coruscant is breathtaking. John Williams is back with the original Star Wars theme and adding masterful additional pieces like ""Dual of the Fates"" and ""Anakin's theme"". I know this film gets a lot of hate and while I can understand, I can no longer hide how I feel. I love this film as a stand alone film and part of the Star Wars saga. The Disney sequels have only cemented the idea in me that episodes 1 - 6 are the beginning and end of the Star Wars Saga, without George Lucas' vision, everything else seems like fan fiction.",1

113,9.0,"Let me start off my review with commenting on Jar-Jar Binks, the most hated character in movie history. He is essential to the story, not just put there for comic relief(by the way, his antics ARE funny). Just imagine this: Take Jar-Jar out of the movie, and what do you have? A lot of cut material. Just think about it. The ride in the Bongo(the gungan sub) in the start of the movie. If he wasn't there, the whole sequence whould have been trimmed down to the point where they leave the gungan city, and when they come up in Theed. Mos Espa: If you took out Jar-Jar, how else whould they have meet Anakin again, since Qui-Gon had no intention of going back to Watto's shop, if it wasn't for Jar-Jar getting in trouble with Sebulba(the films best CGI character) and having Anakin save him. And here comes the most important reason of all. When Queen Amidala is in Palpatine's headquarters in Courscaunt, Jar-Jar tells her of the massive gungan army. When the queen goes back to Naboo, and realizes that she needs help to defeat ther Trade Federation, she seeks the auidence with Boss Nass to get their help, or else the Naboo will lose. Let's go back a few moments. If Jar-Jar wasn't in the movie, he wouldn't have not been there to the Queen of the army, and they would have lost. Get my point. Now on to the movie.

Even if people like the film, they still consider it the worst of the series. Personally I think ROTJ is the worst (don't get me wrong, it's really good) and this movie is fun to watch. It needs to begin the story of Star Wars, and that's what is did, it showed how Anikan grew up, why Obi-wan taught him, and showed how 3P0 and R2 met. Sure Jar-Jar can be a little annoying, but he isn't the worst thing ever put on screen. The effects were amazing, Lucas put a lot of effort into them. So why do people not like it. Do I think it's the worst of the series, no, I don't even think it's the worst of the prequels. It's fun, entertaining, and does all that it need to do, start the story.",0

Nothing can ever compare with those movies, as they were made at a certain time - a sequel, prequel, or remake could NEVER duplicate those movies, no matter how good they were.",1
119,8.0,"Well i must confess before commenting this movie that i'm a great Star Trek fan and anyone know the great rivality between the fan of the two franchises.  Well i never hate Star Wars but more the hardcore fans of SW who often attack Star Trek without great arguments like the Star Destroyer is bigger than the Entreprise so Star Wars is better than Star Trek you see what i'm talking about..., this debate is another story so it would be all for this...  So i go see this movie with the betters intentions in the world i also try to be objective and i put my Vulcan logic aside to replace it by the mythological and the fairy tales stuff of Lucas... Well its a good movie with beautiful eyes candies the space ships are beautiful and all this stuff ... But what about the characters. i left with the impression they have nothing interesting to say some will argue that SW isn't about character development well i don't think so the 3 others movies were somewhat interesting on this subject but the Phantom Menace just don't get it ! One other thing is Anakin at the end of the movie blowing out everything so easily !  Again some will say don't took it too seriously its Star Wars well i think Episode IV V VI were more serious but at same time were appealing to the children but Episode 1 fail on this its too child orienting !  Another things i didn't like is the race, it was cool but i think it was too long... it was also a way for Lucas to sell more video games ...  The first hour of this movie is simply boring and the other hour kick a$$ !  Now i will pass to the more positive aspect of the movie, the final lightsaber combat between Darth Maul and the 2 jedi are simply great and exciting ! Finally i think its a good movie maybe i will see it another time but more than two times i think its fanatism ... well i'm a little fanatic when it came for Star Trek stuff so i understand the Star Wars fans ...",1

You know that inside you really thought the pod race was pretty cool, that the special effects were cool and you quite possibly are a closet Darth Maul fan. Just be out with it, don't give in to the dark side just because it seems like the popular thing to do. This movie was the first new Star Wars movie that I saw on opening day. Someday when I'm old and feeble, I'll be able to tell of the day I went with my friends on May 19th, 1999 to join Obi-Wan and Qui-gon and fight the evil trade federation.

121,6.0,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is an American fantasy/sci-fi movie from 17 years ago. It is the fourth film in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise and the first chronologically. The cast includes quite a couple famous names: Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Terence Stamp, Ewan McGregor and others and they all (more or less) shine in their roles. Unfortunately, one of the major characters is played by a child actor named Jake Lloyd, who was pretty unbearable. It was so obvious how he tried so hard to be on par with all these more experienced actors and he failed miserably. The sad thing is that, despite his age, he was not new to the industry at all, had played with other stars before, so he should really know that sometimes subtlety is the key. Instead, he went full ham for most of his performance and I blame him that this has not become a better film, but also writer-director George Lucas that he did not cast a more talented kid and that he did not tell Lloyd to lay low.",0

126,10.0,"George Lucas really knows what he's doing. I thought the ""Star Wars"" I first saw was the beginning. Now I'm really seeing the real picture on how Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd) became the dreaded Darth Vader. We all know that he's a very skilled pilot, and he befriends Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan MacGregor). And this Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson) who is very unique in his fighting skills. Then there's this annoying character I wished I never knew, Jar-Jar Binks(Ahmet Best). This is I want to take a light saber, and cut off his head, then again, he is helpful in ways. Then there's this Sith fighter named Darth Maul(Ray Park). That is one dark fighter. First of all, a dual-bladed light saber, battles Qui-Gon in the desert. Then my favorite light saber battle between Qui-Gon, Obi-Won, and Darth Maul. That scene is the real deal there. Getting to see Yoda, Yaddle, and Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson) in the Jedi Counsel makes it more interesting to watch. I have to give it to Lucas, he really outdid himself there. May the force be with you. 5 stars!",1
127,9.0,"I have to say that the movie has gotten much better after seeing it multiple times in the theater and now on Widescreen VHS (Though it really deserves DVD treatment).  Many of the things that initially annoyed me such as the voice of the the ViceRoy, The Speech of all Gungans (not just Jar Jar), and the slightly slow start to the movie have become more tolerable with time allowing me to sit back and for the first time say that this movie is just as good as Men In Black and Independence Day.  It may have its flaws, but the force is present in it thanks to the pod race, Darth Sideous/Senator Palpatine, The jedi, and the best light saber battle ever.  It sets up things for the next two prequels and many of the plot holes will probably be filled in by the next movie.  I have a feeling that this movie will grow on people by the time the last prequel is finished and that people will see that it really was necessary to set up the events of the next two prequels. Just imagine HOW GREAT the next VILLIAN in Lucas' mind must be if he had the guts to kill off such a Super Villian as Darth Maul.  Also, Though the midi-chlorians are difficult to swallow now, imagine how easy it will be to accept their explination in the Phantom Menace if they are used as a way to hunt down the Jedi. Seeing Yoda alive again and knowing in the next movie or the third he'll finally show his power in battle. If we had not seen how poorly droids fight, then we would not know why living being still fight battles when they could have robots do it with no casulties. Jar Jar is annoying, but by the third movie he'll be in hiding or (gasp)in that great gungan city in the sky since there is no mention of him in the Original Triligoy. The explanation of these things will give the phantom menace that much more meaning as the future prequels unfold.",1

This movie took into account what the original movies lacked. There was more action, which for the most part was great. Also, we finally get to see a closer look at some of the less known planets, some of which we had seen only a glimpse of at the end of ""Return of the Jedi"". There are though a couple a huge problems the movie did have, that would have put off many people who aren't big fans. One of which is how fast paced parts of the movie were, parts of the movie that I would have loved to be longer were cut short, and plenty of amazing areas are not well focused on. Another thing is that Obi-Wan plays only a small role in the movie, acting as more as Qui-Gons side kick, which for any fan would be bothersome. Also Qui-Gon is never really fully explained, and at the end, you kind of end up wishing that he was not put in, or that more was known about him to make the last major fight scene more dramatic. Overall, this movie will get any fan excited, yet annoyed at the same time, and its best just to watch this movie to continue to explore and appreciate the Star Wars Universe.",1

I would have given the movie 10 out of 10 but there was a few minor things that bothered me. The movie gets a bit too emotional (comparing with the first 3 episodes), not that emotional is bad, but it seems sort of fake to me. Though the thing that bothered me the most, was this creature called Jar Jar Binks. He should have been a comic sidekick, but it is as if he just becomes more and more annoying, the more you watch him instead of him being funny. One of the movie is in my opinion the lightsword battle between good and evil. You can really sense the difference between the two sides in the actors.",0
135,8.0,"Growing up in the late 70's and early 80's ""Star Wars"" movies were my thing something that I grew up with having loved the first three films. Then in 1999 George Lucas started the story back this time with the release of the prequels. Finally after many years I watched Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace. Well I must say that to begin an epic that this was a pretty good try as it's informative and the story and background sets up a development of some central characters that we later come to know in the Star Wars universe. The central theme of episode I involves two Jedi Knights who take a young boy under their wing for Jedi training. Yet it all begins with the evil trade federation trying to tax and overtake the planet of Naboo, as even the talks and political work of Queen Amidala(Natalie Portman)can do no good. So a plan is acted upon to travel to the sands of Tatooine as the queen and the Naboo people are accompanied by two Jedi Knights(Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor)and it's here before starting battle against the trade federation that the discovery of a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker will have an impact on all involved. Later the younger Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor)will take young Anakin under his wing to train despite doubts from the top brass Jedi people. Along the journey and battle everyone is guided along just fine by the fun loving yet funny Jar Jar Binks a character who brings great comic relief to the film. And in an epic battle of good facing evil and light facing darkness both knights face and battle the evil Darth Maul. Overall what more can be said this prequel episode I was a good way to start an epic as it was on spot with development and character introduction that would set the stage for the flight and lift off of the Star Wars saga.",1

It does every last thing wrong. Even the great score isn't enough to redeem this abomination. There is no words to describe how bad it is.

144,8.0,"Episode 1 is meant to introduce us to the boy who would grow up to be Vader and deepen our knowledge of the Jedi religion. It does both of these exceedingly well. Here we meet the boy Anakin Skywalker, enslaved on Tatoine and eventually get our first look at the Jedi council. My only regret with this film is that Darth Maul was so short lived. John Williams outdoes himself scoring this film and the use of CGI is far and above anything I had seen up to this point.<br /><br />So why did I entitle this ""get over yourselves people""? The answer is simple, Jar Jar. It seems that many people, who like me, grew up with these movies being released as they were made, simply forgot that Star Wars is meant to appeal to all ages. I mean, Ewoks, enough said? No? Do you not remember the Ewoks and their subsequent television movies? Is Jar Jar annoying, of course. It does not detract from this film though. IF YOU WATCH THESE FILMS THROUGH THE EYES WITH WHICH YOU FIRST WATCHED A STAR WARS FILM, YOU WILL LOVE IT. End of story.",1
145,7.0,"Episode I is the best movie in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Now, before you dig your pitchforks and torches from the mothballs, allow me to explain myself. Episode I is universally hated among the Star Wars fans because it was such a disappointment. Our expectations were set too high, and thus we were let down when the new Star Wars film didn't meet the quality of the originals. But, then we realized that we had expected too much, lowered our expectations accordingly and thus the next two films weren't met with such disdain.",1

147,10.0,"Well, it was a very good movie, but there wasn't so much action and suspense as in the other Star Wars movies. The only thing that is better in this movie are the special effects, of course. The movie starts slow and boring but the ending is full of action.

148,9.0,"This movie is a great adventure and a great addition to Star Wars, this movie made possible everything great from Star Wars, it created magical worlds and a expirience that makes it lovable, it has great characters like Obi Wan, Qui Gon, Palpatine, Nutt Gunrey, even Padme, I understand people not liking Anakin's behavior, but it is better than Rey, and it gave us a great sound track and Darth Maul, some times it can be Slow, but so as a new hope and I don't see anyone complainig",1

150,10.0,This movie has a lot of things going on below the surface. It has to set up it's own plot to resolve to feel like a self contained story. It has to set up the arch that is going to happen for the next three movies. And connect to what we've already seen. It effortly does them all.,1
151,9.0,"I have never been a great fan of space movies as I find the weird faces and clownish attires rather repulsive. However, it was recommended to me by a french student who came to visit my college in very strong terms. And luckily it was shown on television within a few days and I think the movie was fun and interesting, if not ""good"" in the sense of direction and acting. I think it is very well made and at least the children are sure to like it. The ""natural"" emotions of the unnatural characters were particularly appealing and the setting of the scenes very excellent. However, there is nothing special about performance of the actors. To end, I would say it is a nice family entertainer and not one which would leave a mark on you but you will not get bored during the movie.",1
152,9.0,"It's hard to review the Star Wars saga and not say things that haven't been said a thousand times already. However, I'm going to take a different approach when reviewing the series, reviewing them in their proper chronological order rather than the order they were originally released. As we review the series in episodic order, we'll start off with Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, the most critically malled, panned, torn apart entry in the series. Never before has there come a film that has been so hyped and so hated by many Star Wars fanatics, and still to this day, nearly 14 years since the film's original release, the film still gets a ton of crap poured upon it. When the film was released in 3-D a year ago, instead of being excited, many were moaning and groaning and resorting to a certain internet reviewer's 90 minute review of the film. ",1
153,8.0,"A good start to the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader. A fun, if grim and at times humorless film, the weakest part is the kid who plays young Anakin. He's just not that good in the role, but honestly , George should have had someone like lawrence kasdan come in and tweak the script. If one hates writing, then why write? Still the look of the film clearly shows how it will evolve into the later movies, something other Prequels (like Enterprise, utterly fail at).",0

158,3.0,"Star Wars, the Phantom Menace, is perhaps one of the most disappointing movies of all time, but that's not so much the director to blame, but also the fact we all were expecting almost the Second Coming, and then, all we got was just a mediocre movie, with boring characters, boring story, and a bunch of eye-candy. George Lucas should have known that special effects without a good story aren't impressive anymore. In the seventies, watching ""Star Wars"", the ""fairy tale in space with cool effects"" was ground breaking, because it mixed a recognizable story ""peasant saves the princess and becomes a knight"" with a creative environment. But in the 90s, watching ""a pointless tale with computer effects"" was just boring.",0

If you go back and watch Phantom Menace kinda from Jar Jar's perspective as some secret Sith Lord, then it really does make it so much better. There's a bit where Jar Jar waves his hand when Sebulba attacks him and Sebulba starts to back off so it's like as if Jar Jar does a mind trick on him there.",0

The The Film is the best out o the Star Wars Saga with The High Octane Political Underpinnings with a brilliant Story and fantastic visuals and the best Lightsaber fight Between Obi- Wan Kenobi, Qui- Gon Jinn & Darth Maul in The Epic Duel Of Fates , Amazing Cinematography By David Tattersall(The Green Mile),Production Design By Gavin Bocquet(Kafka) and Special Effects By Dennis Muren(T2 Judgement Day) ,Amazing Direction from The King of Star Wars Himself George Lucas(American Graffiti ), Fantastic Costume design from Trisha Biggar(Young Indiana Jones ) and Amazing Score from John Williams(Jurassic Park) definitely one of my favorite movies ever 10/10",1
164,8.0,"Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) is very underrated pure fun action prequel to the prequel Star Wars trilogy. I think this movie is very hated and very bashed from critics and fans. In my opinion I love it, I think it is miles way better flick than The Force Awakens! The Phantom Menace didn't kill Han Solo (in such a awful way) or rip off A New Hope beat. The Phantom Menace has a cooler villain in Darth Maul (and a cooler weapon. And at LEAST Phantom Menace has some new music that was worth Duel of the Fates. Like I said I love Liam Neeson as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor as his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in this flick. I think the actors did a wonderful job, the way George Lucas imagine to do it. I love Queen Amidala/Padmé with all that make up and the costume that was created for her. Natalie Portman did an excellent job portraying her character, she is very sexy talented and extremely gorgeous in here. I remember in 1999 when they were talking about filming this film, I still have news papers clips saved in my drawer when they where filming this film. Honestly I love The Phantom Menace more than Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. ",1
165,7.0,"Episode 1: The Phantom Menace isn't as strong as the original trilogy, sadly. The performances from Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best as young Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks are not that good, the writing is very mediocre, and the pacing dragged on for a bit too long, but everything else makes up for it. The performances from Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and the other actors were decent enough, the action sequences are spectacular, the visual effects while a bit dated still looks really solid even after it came out in 1999, and John Williams delivers a satisfying music score especially the cue ""Duel of the Fates"" in the epic lightsaber duel between Qui Gon Jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul. So, overall, not the best and I understand why some people hated it, but its a decent start to the prequel trilogy after twenty years.",1

169,9.0,"It is understandable that so many people underappreciate this movie for two reasons The first is simply the large fan base. It is virtually impossible to please so large a group. The second reason, which could alleviate the first, is that many people fail to look at The Phantom Menace as the first chapter in the saga. The movie has to not only stand alone but also lay the foundation for further chapters. Sadly many have overlooked the sheer creativity and inventiveness of Lucas and his team in creating this science fiction masterpiece. On another note many have accused the film of using ethnic stereotypes. Watto is seen as being a stereotypically avaricious Jewish merchant while the Viceroy (who oddly is wearing vaguely Catholic looking ceremonial attire) is seen as a scheming Oriental tyrant replete with a World War II Hollywood Asian accent. And then there is Jar Jar Binks with his Jamacian pigeon English and Stepin Fetchit characterization. Only Lucas can say for certain whether the characters were intentionally modeled on such stereotypes but I doubt it given the universal themes of the Star Wars saga. It's also interesting to note that no one complains when anyone, even a minority, makes fun of Arnold Schwarzeneggar's accent but if someone were to poke fun of say Jackie Chan's accent, there would be an uproar. I guess that's a double standard we live with but I digress. As pure film, The Phantom Menace is a visual masterpiece. We'll have to wait until Episode III to see just how well Episode I served as the first chapter. Even as a stand alone film, though, it one the greatest science fiction epics ever.",1

I think the movie was just about on par as the other films and was entertaining its own way. Some people claim that its not original or lacks of creativity, which is way off base. Its a Star Wars film so it has to borrow elements fromt the original films to make sense. It wouldn't be a particular interesting film if it was about slave life on Tatooine or the political underpinnings of the Republic Senate. It has to have certain elements from the original films to be a fun film which this film basically was. Granted the plot was a bit complicated and at times convoluted and there was scenes that seemed to drag(the dinner scene, the Anakin-Qui-Gon Stuf, etc.) but on the whole it was generally entertaining. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",1

It could be just an interpretation but the character of Anakin is designed as a new saver while the cities of Tatooine remember Jerusalem. Lucas created something that could be considered a generational phenomena but he didn't do it by chance he really touched our most important roots. Another reference could be easy find in the Pad race that it's a pretty present to Ben Hur. Come on and see it.",1

180,9.0,"I am a fan of the Star Wars saga. I have always enjoyed the movies and I believe those who were disappointed are not being objective about this movie at all. I'll admit that I was expecting more from this movie in some aspects. The main problem that overall people really have with this movie and many don't even realise it is that one of the major plot elements, the conflict between the Naboo, and Gungans was not brought to the forefront with more of a sense of danger. I think Lucas was caught in a bind presentation wise because he wanted to bring the Jedi's conflict to the forefront and it cost this movie in the long run. There were specific scenes in the first three films that put the raw dangers of the Empire to the forefront.Examples of these scenes are when Luke returns home in 'A New Hope' to see that his only family in the universe have been killed, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite just after he and Leia realised their love for each other in 'Empire Strikes Back, and when Luke is tested and tempted by the Emperor, the Emperor apparently two steps ahead of Luke in 'Return of the Jedi.'All the while in the movie there were references to an invasion and people dying of catastrophic numbers but this was not for me at least brought to the front page. Qui Gon tells the queen at one point that he can't fight a war for her but with the way the cowardly Neimodians and weak droids are pushed around I don't see why not.The Gungan droid battle should not have been relegated to a mere distraction and even if it were the Gungans had no casualties. Even though I know Lucas wanted to preserve the PG rating I still think he should have brought the grittiness of the conflict equally through the major characters eyes. Just a pinch more of Dramtic punch would have done th trick. He had done that so well in all of the other Episodes and ultimately the dangers of the conflict were not evenly distributed. However this movie still is a remarkable achievment. The imagination and talents of many people  still flow through this movie. The realisation of the underwater Gungan city, the podrace sequence, and the Duel of the Fates is visuallly amazing. I don't think the performances are wooden. I like Natalie Portman's portrayal of the young Queen. Jake Lyod's Anakin is very raw and he has an unpolished quality that naturally comes through for me. 'How does this wideeyed boy become so disenchanted with his life that he believes his only recourse is the Dark Side?'These elements are done very well and are typical Star Wars fare. To me this movie is a great opening act introducing the world to the players and eludes to future events. For me this movie sure teases the appetite for more and I know that I will see Attack of the Clones because of the questions left unanswered by The Phantom Menace. As a stand alone film this movie was an incredible movie experience.",1

It was a long sixteen years between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, and for most of those years it actually seemed as if George Lucas would never get back to his epic space opera.  During that time though, I did believe that if and when Lucas decided to give it another go, that he should change his mind about Episodes I - III, and perhaps give us Episodes VII - IX, with a new story line and new characters.  The problem with prequels is and always has been, that no matter how you tell the story, you know how it will turn out in the end.  It is this fact that usually makes prequels box office poison.  I did know that if any writer, director, producer, could pull it off successfully it would be George Lucas.  Did he succeed?  In Episode One it appears that he did.",0

Acting hit a new low, and the new characters didn't live up to the standards set by Han, Leia and Luke in the old movie.  Jar Jar is annoying and needs to take a long walk off a short pier in the next movie. Plus, it didn't take long to figure out what was going to happen.  So maybe it wasn't fully Lucas's fault.  I mean, how concerned are you  going to be when Obi Wan is ""fighting to the death"" with Darth Maul when you remember that Obi Wan is in ""A New Hope""?  This movie is a huge disappointment when compared to the first three.  The special effects are amazing, but other than that it's not worth it.",0

But, all else aside this movie is just great for me. I seen it when I was 9 or 10, young age and was just starting to become a geek for Star Wars. Seeing Star Wars Episode I for the first time in theaters was memorable for me. I mean, I actually sold my Playstation One for a measly 80$ just to see this and It was sort of worth it after later of realization, Lol. I can forgive Jar Jar cause I never really dewelled on his character, and thus still having great action, visual effects stunning as ever, and POD racing was a great rush.

What can anyone think of (special effects wise) that hasn't been done before? The original Star Wars films are excellent but half the magic of those films were the special effects being so ground breaking for that time. Nowadays you can make entire films using computers (toy story, a bugs life, antz), you can make the white house explode without a single person saying ""That didn't look realistic"".

I assumed the fault was with the film now I'm not so sure the fault wasn't with me. I was never the biggest Star Wars fan anyway, I'd seen the original two or three times over the years and never been that impressed but since acquiring all six films on DVD I thought I'd give it a real go again and for the the first time I really enjoyed the original film and started to see what all the fuss was about. So in a short space of time I've watched all three of the original films and then I saw this and it did make a huge difference I could follow the story much better and know who the characters were and more importantly who they would become. Now I think 'The Phantom Menace is a much better film then I had thought, maybe not comparable with the first Star Wars but I found it was much much better than 'Return Of The Jedi' which I thought quite poor in many areas. There is perhaps a little too much emphasis on humour which I agree doesn't always work but on the whole the balance between action, talking and humour is pretty balanced. I think when it first came out the expectation was so high that there was no way it could live up to it, in fact I think the film is very comparable and consistent to the others in the series and in my opinion a big improvement on the last film.

205,9.0,"Perhaps it was George Lucas's return to the helm, but this installment of the `Star Wars' saga is surprisingly entertaining, working as an interesting saga and not merely as backstory to the legendary trilogy. It's certainly far superior to the sequels of the original, neither of which Lucas directed. There's more of a focus on the characters here than in the previous films (Lucas brings in a heavyweight in Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor has already established himself as an actor of some repute) but there's plenty of attention to detail and the look of the film itself is a dense, roving kaleidoscope with an emphasis on the burnished browns and dark reds that may be an influence from Kurosawa's color films. (Indeed the concept of `Star Wars' itself seems directly influenced by Kurosawa.) Some of the action sequences, such as the pod race that is the centerpiece of the film, may seem overly familiar but they're deftly handled and exciting nonetheless. Lucas is clearly in love with chivalry and his fight scenes are filled with motivations of honor, dignity and justice. With the exception of the contemptuously annoying Jar Jar Binks (it's hard to get past the implications his character represents), there's a lot to admire here and it's greatly appreciated.",0
206,9.0,"I can't really defend Jar Jar all that much. I don't really find him that character that annoying or offensive. He has a couple of moments that make me chuckle, but for the most part he's not funny unless your five. His character is a very self conscious attempt to pander to that kind of audience and it just fails. Furthermore, Jar Jar isn't important to the story. Many of the other characters in the story give Jar Jar annoyed looks and go about their business to more interesting parts of the story; I do the same as a member of the audience.",0
207,6.0,"The Phantom Menace, I felt did a good job of introducing the beginning of Anakin Skywalker. When talks of The Phantom Menace, many say that this is the worst film of the series, but after rewatching it now, this film is really overhated. The story is interesting, and there are few dull moments in this film. Qui-Gon Jinn is such a cool character and Liam Neeson does a great job of portraying Qui-Gon Jinn. I wish there was more exploration around Qui-Gon Jinn. Darth Maul is another cool character and I love how the directors and writers created such mystery around him. There are many flaws in this prequel, but there are many positives as well, I seriously think this film is overhated.",0
208,4.0,The only reason I am writing this review is to revile Jar Jar. You need read no further if you think he was an okay addition to Star Wars.,0
209,9.0,"The Phantom Menace was made near perfection in my opinion. The only reason it's not a 10 is because it's quite slow in the middle of the film. However, they had to do this to develop the characters of Qui-Gon, Padme, and Anakin. The acting was perfect. The story is beautiful and the deeper understanding of the film is quite unknown. I do understand George Lucas' philosophy and type of story telling so it is easier for me to understand. It sets up a whole new era of Star Wars so you have to expect it to be a little slow. The choreography of the duels is amazing! If you think there are moments that copy the OT, George Lucas said this, ""it's like poetry, it rhymes.""<br /><br />So haters can hate but it's not a bad movie when you truly understand cinema from George Lucas' perspective.",1
210,9.0,"George Lucas had his work cut out for him on this movie. First, he had to re-introduce us to characters from the first trilogy and characters who will play important roles in this trilogy.  Second, he had to set the stage for what is to come in episodes 2 and 3 (not to mention the first trilogy). Third, he had to keep things consistent with what we saw in the first trilogy.  Finally, he had to tell a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end.  IMHO, George Lucas succeeded in every way. If you loved Star Wars, you will love this movie. Some people's expectations were too high (though fan-generated hype?), and this lead to a negative backlash against the movie. Some people categorised this movie as a ""kids"" movie (because of its upbeat tone?), but this is a movie that people of *all* ages were meant to enjoy.  This is a great movie! (IMHO, of course)",1
211,1.0,"I'm not a Star Wars fan and I have not seen the other Star Wars movies. But, I don't need to see them to know that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Jar Jar Binks and Anakin (Jake Lloyd) are the most annoying characters I have ever seen on screen. I will never understand why George Lucas decided to cast Jake Lloyd as Anakin. His acting is awful in this movie. Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala is no better. I won't even mention Jar Jar Binks. We all know how pathetic he was. In short; the plot is lame, the acting is awful, and the effects are OK. The effects alone could not save this film. If you have not seen this poor excuse for a movie, then don't bother renting it. Save your money for coffee or something. Out of 10 I give this movie 1.",0
212,9.0,"One thing we're all hearing on the news right now, is how a new Star Wars film is coming out. There is a lot of hype and excitement. I was wondering if there'd be anymore Star Wars after Episode 3. I even remember talking with friends back in 1999 about Lucas planning episodes 7-9. Right now, it's only to 7. When Episode 1 came out we were anticipating sequels every 3-years. So, after a 10-year hiatus another Star Wars movie is coming out, which has brought lots of excitement especially to the Star Wars fans. More excitement than when episodes 2 and 3 came out as those were anticipated movies only 3-years apart.",1
213,5.0,"OK, so ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was a big letdown for us all. Apparently, most people even understood the plot when it came out. It wasn't until I listened to ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"" - the ""American Pie"" spoof - on his album ""Running with Scissors"" that I understood the plot.",0
214,9.0,"Yes, there is too much Jar Jar, but the production design, special effects and (especially) the musical score make this a thoroughly engaging movie. It's for kids, which is as it should be.

215,1.0,"The day I went to see this back in the summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to be given this piece of garbage.",0

217,10.0,"In the twenty two years that passed since A New Hope came out, the cult following of the film swelled so much that it became a phenomenon unto itself; there is no film-following like Star Wars mania, and as a result people forget what Star Wars is, and has HAS ALWAYS BEEN about.",1
218,10.0,"The story to SW1 is actually very detailed and interesting. Now I will admit the dialogue is not superb, but the story does flow and leaves viewers anticipating the next sequel. This movie is a backdrop - an introduction of the Star Wars Universe, the Republic, the Jedi, Other characters and the Trade Federation. This is not an easy task to accomplish - explaining to viewers where all the elements of the original trilogy come from. I think people were expecting this to be right up there with the first three, but forgot to realize that this movie is the beginning of the saga..... Viewers also complained about the complexity of the plot with all the politics....my thoughts are that we need to be informed of the fragile and crumbling centre of the republic in order to completely understand the birth of the Empire. But now that this has all been done, I believe that the action will kick into full swing with ""Attack of the Clones"" (Episode II) Check out the documentaries on the Official site.....especially ""trying to do my thing"" Take a look at our next Anakin.....I think we all will be pleasantly surprised with what the next movie has to offer. Anyway my rating for The Phantom Menace is a healthy 8.5/10.",1
219,10.0,"People I knew told me this movie was I waste when it was in the theatres, so I took their advice and stayed away from it. This was a mistake. When it came out on video the following Spring, I watched it and loved it. Lucas keeps the spirit of Star Wars alive. Out of 10, this one gets a 9.",0
220,10.0,"This movie is terrific and just as good as the first three. I loved all the characters, the worlds explored, the eye candy, and the mysterious storyline. It is just as I expected the Star Wars saga would begin, with strife slowly growing in the fabric of the great Republic. It doesn't run too long either. I can't say I'm a bona fide Star Wars fan; I just love great stories. Star Wars will be a story I will love experiencing again and again once all six episodes are together. This installment may have let some people down because it didn't answer all their questions, but I love its mystique and childlike spirit. It will be a great beginning for the dark chapters that are likely to come. I can't say enough about how fun this movie is. Placed historically alongside the first three movies, it cannot be near as great, but once it's one of six, the entire saga will shine as the greatest example of how great one's imagination can be. The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Episode III, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi--how I will love them all. And how I wish I could personally thank Mr. Lucas for this incredible gift. I just can't wait for May 25, 2005, oh how great that day will be. It's great just to get away from this gawdawful mess of a world for a few hours and experience something not quite like anything else. I only wish more people could enjoy this movie, but that's their loss.",1
221,5.0,"The first time I saw this film I was impressed.  Sure Jar Jar was annoying but the action was enough to keep me interested and I was anxious to find out how the Empire would be formed.  After watching it a second time, knowing the action that would take place, I listened carefully to the dialogue.  Again, Jar Jar's mangled English was of course annoying.  The new thing I really noticed was that none of the characters seemed to really know what they were doing in the movie.  The dialogue was awful and the hinted ""relationship"" between Anakin and his babysitter at the end was sick and wrong.",0

223,9.0,"I was one of those people who flopped into theaters with one ominous thought on my mind: Star Wars- Episode 1 might suck.  REALLY BAD.  But it didn't. And legions of Trekkies have just ran back into their closets to cower in fear as the juggernaut called LucasArts plows through the market once more. What I saw in Lucas' new wunderkind was something I hadn't seen in movies in ages- a wholesome, safe-for-all-ages (except for that one scene, no spoilers now!) yarn that still kept you on the edge of your seat with fantastic sequences like the Podrace (can you say ""WipeOut?"") and the final battle between Obi-Wan, Schindler (I meant Qui-Gon Jinn), and Darth Maul (I meant Satan).  While I did some obnoxious MSTing throughout (mostly ""Kill Jar-jar! Kill Jar-jar!"") I was thoroughly pleased with this movie.  We have edge-of-your-seat dramatics (those always help), anime-influenced combat scenes (if you ever watch anything from Yukito Kishiro or Mamoru Oshii, you'll know what I mean), and a staggeringly cool new villain by the name of Darth Maul (I see your schwartz is as big as mine... but I have two!).  My suggestion, if you haven't seen Episode 1 yet, is to haul yourself and a half-dozen friends over to the theater and buy a matinee ticket!  Okay, that's a little extreme, but I still think you should see this movie, if Star Wars is your bag.  If it isn't, then -the following material has been censored by the IMDb due to graphic language and crude sexual content.-",1
224,5.0,"Went back and watched this after watching the Sequel trilogy to see how they compare. Conclusion? This is not a good movie. If it weren't for Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, and pod racing this would be an atrocious movie.",0
225,6.0,"I have just given this a refresh viewing & I can honsetly say the Phantom Menace is a MASTERPIECE when compared to the utter garbage that Disney has been dishing up, disguised as Star Wars over the past few years. Sure it has its obvious problems, such as the disastrous Jar Jar Binks & the casting of a cute kid who can't act who is supposed to be the future evil Darth Vader, in this film referred to as ""Annie"" ? With said young Darth Vader saying lines such as ""Yippe, opps, take this & woHooo!"" sorry, just does not work. The story is also very weak with far too much attention being paid to visuals & CGI, which actually make it pleasing to the eye. However when you consider the awesome acting talent here Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Samual L. Jackson, Natalia Portman & Ian McDiarmid, its hard to believe how badly their characters come across, which leads me to the conclusion that the characters were not developed enough, a script that was sadly lacking & poor direction. However, all the actors did their very best. Anyway, after suffering the resent Disney ""efforts"" at Star Wars with the in your face social justice agenda, the Phantom Menace is almost an utter joy to watch! Just take it at face value. It is not a ""good"" SW story, but the visuals are well done & imaginative which almost make up for some of its other less redeeming qualities & the only real dissapointment for me was the compleat waste of superb acting talent. But its still entertaining.",0
226,8.0,Am I the only one who thinks that Jar Jar Binks is much less annoying than the ever pointless roaring Chewbacca?,0
227,8.0,I saw so many people bashing this movie all because of Jar Jar Binks. I don't believe he belongs in this movie and he was annoying but other than that this movie is pretty good. It's not as good as the original trilogy but it's still watchable. I will admit the special effects are pretty bad. It seemed like I was watching a movie from the late 60's-early 70's.,0
228,8.0,"First off, I'm definitely a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy.  I'm not as die-hard as some, but I've enjoyed the movies greatly over the years. As for The Phantom Menace, it's definitely not my favorite of the films, but I definitely don't despise it.",1
229,8.0,"When the original trilogy came out, it totally amazed me. Although I didn't find everything perfect- certain things could have evolved differently etc, these movies got imprinted in me and my imagination. They were bright, innovative, artistic, had an atmosphere of devoutness and awe, and in a lot of ways represented things scarce in our world: Beauty, innocence, clear distinction between ""good"" and ""evil"", along an entire versatile universe, likable characters, imaginative scenery, compelling and tense story and a lot more. In some ways, I think, they inspired me as a person- and this capability, to inspire beyond simply entertaining, is a trait of many great movies arguably but rarely accomplished by SF! In any case, they were a point of reference to me- an almost perfect sample of fantasy/science fiction. Thankfully, a lot of people in the world felt the same!",1
230,2.0,"I'm sure everyone has heard all their friends, relatives, and random passerbys gripe over the immense waste of computer generated imagery known as Jar-Jar Binks, but I just can't help it.  No movie character has ever driven me to the brink of tongue chomping, teeth gnashing psychosis like that floppy eared moron.  I cannot understand why this creature (which appears to be the combination of a four-year-old, Carribbean native, a mutated guppy, and that weird dragon/dog thing from Neverending Story with bigger lip implants) is even included.  All he manages to do is p*** people off while at the same time manage to avoid death every moment due to some undeserved luck.  So many times I found myself praying that one of the Jedis would just draw their saber and silence the fish-man forever. Unfortunately, the Jedi code restricts such action, proving that the dark side is much more agreeable.",0
231,8.0,"Having watched the movie, I can say it was very enjoyable, but not in the way that I expected. For a film with a top drawer cast of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ian MacDiarmid, Frank Oz, Samuel Jackson and Natalie Portman I was hoping that the film would be dramatic, with some dark overtones. Instead the decision to aim the film at under 12's robs a cast of this stature of anything significant for them to do. This is not helped by the decision of Lucas to move away from the naturalistic acting style of the original three films, a style which would have benefited this excellent cast. The only cast members who comes over with any real charm are characters that are played by voice actors, puppeteers and computer graphics character animators! ",0
232,5.0,"Well, here it is then; my first 'Star Wars' film. I thought it might be better to watch them chronologically rather than in the initial order as I had heard of all the hatred towards this episode so I thought I'd dislike it equally if I'd seen the original trilogy first; hence, I gave it the chance it deserved. On the whole, I'm glad I did.",1

237,1.0,"This tawdry, awful, boring piece of rubbish makes me think that George Lucas knew the mere mention of the name 'Star Wars' would attract an audience, so why bust his arse making it? Why does it suck? Let me count the ways: 1. Jar Jar Binks. Really enough said right there. Lucas was so full of himself promoting a 'fully digital' character, he didn't bother making sure it was a 'good' character. It wasn't. 2. The annoying little kid who played Darth Vader. I'm sorry, but kid or not, little Darth would not be saying 'Yippee' when flying about. Also, Lucas missed a great moment to show how bad little Darth could become in the chariot race (let's face it, it's lifted straight from Ben Hur). He could have had Darth flinch, or gesture involuntarily and push the other racers away from him (or something similar) without realising what he had done. That would have been great. 3. Taking a good actor like Natalie Portman and making her speak in a dull monotone throughout the film. That'll put the audience to sleep. 4. Using weak, comedy relief robots for the bad guys. Well we can't have little Darth shooting real people can we? 5. Introducing this ridiculous concept of the (whatever they are) in the blood which creates the force. When Alec Guiness explained the force in the original, he made it sound great. Liam Neeson (not his fault) made it sound like a blood disease.",0
238,10.0,"The Phantom Menace is an excellent Star Wars film, it has the perfect beginning for what is now known as ' The Skywalker Saga', and the second best film in the prequel trilogy. Loved it as a child and still love it to this day at the age on 26.",1
239,10.0,"I just got to see this film yesterday in re-release.  Overall I thought it was very well done and extremely well cast.  Stand out performances by Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman in particular.  Portman is an excellent actress and has a great deal of presence which makes her delightful to watch.  Ewan McGregor was very good in his portrayal of the young Obi Wan, and did an extraordinary job of emulating Sir Alec Guinness' style in previous performances.",1
240,2.0,"I remember when this film came out, I kept putting off seeing it. And putting it off, and off. Then it came out on video, and I finally rented it. I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right. It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen. The acting was stody and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them. Alas, no. Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows. It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer. Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe). They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels. They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals... Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here. There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it. Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they? I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters. And why did he decide to make the prequels? If he made the 3 films that were supposed to take place after Return of the Jedi, he would have had no real creative restraints. Who knows why George Lucas does what he does? I haven't a clue, other than I really disliked this film.",0
241,8.0,"I have two main problems with this movie. Number one, I think we all know what this one is, Jar Jar. I don't think Jar Jar is bad in all scene, in fact, there are two scenes I actually genuinely find funny. Other than those, he just gets redundant and annoying, and just pointless. The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid. I don't mind the politics, it's just the fact that the whole storyline is based on taxes and treaties and that crap. The overall storyline moves pretty fast and is relatively exciting. This movie has good effects (for the most part) and has really cool action scenes. There are some line deliveries that the respective actor kind-of butchered, it's not bad, the lines are just stale and dull. The only actors that applies to though are Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but I think they do fine. I don't hate Jake Lloyd as young Anakin, I think he actually perfectly shows what would be a kid Darth Vader. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ray Parker all do fantastic in their roles. Ray Parker makes an excellent Darth Maul. I am also a big fan of Darth Maul. So, it is an exciting, and I would say good movie, it just has some dumb things sprinkled in their.",0
242,4.0,"A standard critical comment is, ""The special effects were fine; but the script ...""  Well, the special effects weren't fine.  They were an embarrassing failure.  They were never as convincing as those of the first two movies (and, on the whole, they fell short of the third as well). Very little looks or feels or moves as if it were solid.  Lucas gets around this problem by switching camera angles at random so as to never let us get a clear view of anything.  It must have worked.  Legions of fans were willing to walk out of cinemas saying dutifully how good the special effects were; and those who disliked the film as a whole found other bones of contention and so were willing to concede the point.",0

There's one thing I remember from that screening back in '99: When Qui-Gon was fighting Darth Maul as Obi-Wan was behind the blast shield, my mom leaned in and said something like ""he's a good fighter"" referring to Liam Neeson and how he wasn't known for action roles at the time.

253,7.0,"waited for this movie for about 15 years since i saw Return of the Jedi almost every day as a kid ,(well not the entire movie but the endor space battle i could not get enough).So when i suddenly heard in 1998 that there was a new Star Wars Movie coming out i could not believe it. So i waited for the big Day .And went to the Theater ...Alone of course. And the Star Wars Title started rolling up along with the Great Fanfare of John. Williams..i didn't know what to expect,cause i had avoided every star wars trailer poster or whatever had to o with the Film. So the beginning was great a usually pan down and i space ship flying by.The first 20 minutes or so its all lighsaber battles ,you see obi wan young with his master and its very exiting.The visuals are great and all is fine.Than the movie starts to slow down when our heroes meet jar jar and save the princess.We finally meet r2 d2 for the first time and he saves the day.By this time i was still very exited about the whole thing.Enter anakin...well this was i guess my first moment when i started to say ,wait a minute...the acting of this little boy was not convincing,his tatooine accent was terrible American,compared to watto's.By the way i love watto's voice and Animation.I had thought that we would meet anakin way older and i was hoping for a little more Acting skills...i cant believe that over thousand's they choose this little kid.Well tha pod race really blew me away.but overall there was no character development ,obi wan had a couple of lines only...and thats like the main guy here.If it wasn't for Obi Wan ,Anakin never would have become so powerful nor Darth Vader.So i expected more story on Obi Wan.Not why jar jar was banished and nonsense talk like this. Well the movie went on and i got a little frustrated..i really was missing the old folks..and the Final Battle was exactly as the first and that sucked!!! Anakin destroying the Federation Comandship by accident was just to lame if you compare it to how hard it was to take out both death stars.Every time i watch episode 4 i still get nervous in the trench.So the day was saved by anakin this time.And he got accepted for being trained by obi wan.The Duel against Darth Maul is the best lighsaber duel ever!!!

254,9.0,"I am a suspect to write about Star Wars, because I like very much the story and I watched the old trilogy many times when I was a kid. ''The Phantom Menace'' is the first episode of the Star Wars series and when we start to know about Luke and Leia's parents, Amidala and Anakin, and also about the Siths and Jedis. We don't have many problems in the galaxy until then, so many people have a better quality of life than in the older trilogy, when everybody is afraid of Darth Vader: even princess Leia wear simple clothes, while her mother Amidala had the most flashy and outstanding wardrobe ever made! For me was very nice to see Obi Wan Kenobi as a young apprentice who does not want to be Anakin's master and to know Obin wan's master, the calm Qui-Gon Jinn. Watching episode 1 ,we can see one of the reasons why Anakin would be a problem in the future, being apart from his mother who continued to be a slave in the planet Tattooine. I started to understand more Anakin and when I saw that cute and smart sweet boy I could not believe he would become a monster in the future.",1

Besides, people seem to hate this movie because it's boring. Well, the part where Palptine is trying to convince the senate that he is eligible for the rank of chancellor can be interesting if you just PAY ATTENTION!!! Also, people think young Anakin Skywalker is annoying for the most stupid reasons ever made. He's not a brat, or a bad kid... SO WHY!!!

The Jedis, Obi Wan and Qui Gon were good, although Obi Wans character could have been better especially as Ewan McGregor is a great actor. But the movie is great. All the special effects are done with incredible detail. Most of all i like the final fight between Darth Maul and the Jedi´s, beacuse it´s so great coreographed. Another great scene is the pod race.

260,8.0,"""The Phantom Menace"" registers the lowest in fan appreciation of all the films in the Star Wars franchise. Fair enough, one of the six had to just through simple math. But with a few exceptions, I thought the film held up rather well as the introduction to the Darth Vader mythos. Understanding that George Lucas' epic saga had to begin somewhere, it's not all that unbelievable that the story should begin the way it did in Episode I, with the portrayal of Anakin Skywalker as a precocious young lad with a fascination for mechanics and pod-racing. Which brings me to one of the first criticisms of 'Menace', that Anakin (Jake Lloyd) wasn't menacing enough, or exhibit a touch of evil that would develop into a Sith characteristic. Listen, if you're looking for ""The Omen"", then go watch ""The Omen"". Though he was born into slavery, Anakin appeared to have been brought up as a solid, well rounded individual by his mother (Pernilla August), and even though surrounded by petty thieves and cutthroats, was able to keep a level head on his shoulders. As for Lloyd's acting ability, it seemed to me that he maintained a level of self confidence and character throughout the story, which is all anyone could ask given the pressure that the notoriety of the role would bring.",1
261,1.0,"I have been a 'Star Wars' fan since first seeing it back in 1977 at the age of thirteen. I've seen 'A New Hope' at least twenty times, 'The Empire Strikes Back' about a dozen, and 'Return of the Jedi' more than once. I've read many of the novels and to this day still collect toys and action figures. I spent eight hours in line for tickets and a seat, finally seeing 'The Phantom Menace' on the first day at 3:00 AM. I desperately wanted to like it, and made every attempt to make allowances and keep an open mind.",1
262,8.0,"This movie is actually good. Beautiful choreography paired with amazing cinematography, although there are some pretty bad lines, give this film an amazing feel. Although you don't need this film to finish the rest of the saga, likable characters and amazing saber fights with dips and dives not imagined will have you wanting to see more. Arguably the best of the prequels of the amazing adventure of a series. Watch this movie without adding it to the rest of the movies to get the best feel and an amazing standalone film. Don'fall into the bandwagon of hating this movie! I loved it as you will too. Of you liked any of the Star Wars movies, you'll understand how good this film really is.",1
263,3.0,"I don't know what to make of this. Was Lucas trying to recapture the glory days of the original trilogy? I'm not sure but for the most part this film really blows. I know sequels can never outshine the original although in some cases, they do and Empire Strikes Back is a great example; directed by Irvin Kershner. Yes the film has dazzling special effects and the light saber duel at the end is great, but when the dialog is so putrid and contrived and the acting so wooden and lifelessly constipated, it leaves one feeling how Lucas can stoop so low. Characters such as Qui-Gon Jin, Ben Kenobi, and Amidala are barely developed; leaving them nothing more than vapid souls against the uninspired screenplay. The other characters such as the Gungan leader and Watto, are basically blatant racial stereotypes. To make matters worse, they casted a child actor as Anakin, played to imperfection by that little pint-sized muppet Jake Loyd. And last but not least, the most hated hated character in the SW universe Jar Jar Binks, who should've died a VERY HORRIBLE DEATH at the righteous hand of the sadly underused Darth Maul!! The original trilogy had its fare share of corny dialog, but not the extent that this movie provides. All in all, TPM fumbled critically with fans and critics and I happen to be one of them because Lucas has lost his touch with what made the original so enamored and charming: Genuine excitement. Had he filmed the prequels first back in the late '70s, then the originals later on, it could've been even greater. But as it stands, TPM is a forgettable giant pile of excrement that should forever be flushed down the cinematic toilet.",0
264,10.0,"I fear I must depart from just about all the other hard-core Star Wars fans I know, especially those who (like me) grew up on the original trilogy (Episodes IV-VI). I felt Star Wars Episode 1 was the best of the four Star Wars films so far. The critics, and in particular the Star Wars fans, have been much too hard on this film. First of all, they're forgetting that when they first saw Star Wars, many of them were 5, 10, or 15 years old. These people are now 25, 30, or 40 years old; they can't help but view Episode 1 through VERY different eyes. Judging how you felt upon seeing Episode 1 when you're a jaded 30 year old, vs. seeing the original when you're an amazed, wide-eyed 8 year old, is patently unfair to the new movie, and to George Lucas.",1
265,9.0,I thought that the film was great and i can't wait for Episode II to come out in 2002. The lightsabre battles had been improved greatly from the originals and the special effects were brilliant. i recommend this film to anybody who wants a good day out at the cinema,1
266,9.0,"I always get annoyed when people say how bad this movie is. I always feel they're overreacting. Phantom Menace has a few flaws, but is otherwise good. There are only 3 main problems I have. One is explanations. Obviously this movie was made after the OT, but I felt it was supposed to be presented as the first one. A lot of things, such as lightsabers and mind tricks, are not explained and may confuse people. Second is acting. I actually don't see too much wrong with this, but here and there Jake Lloyd delivers a bad line, as well as his friends and such. Third is the corny parts. Examples are JarJar's battle scene and a bit of Anakin flying his starfighter to save the day. But all three things aren't too bad, and I only wish the IMDb offered 9.5 stars, because I just can't give it a 10. Oh well, a 9 is still an A.",0

And NO ONE should have expected that magic could be duplicated. But I'm here to tell you: THE PHANTOM MENACE is a pretty fun flick in it's own right! Following in the footsteps of STAR WARS IV: A NEW HOPE, this film actually copies that formula very well. An assortment of heroes (human, alien, and robotic) band together to save a queen (in STAR WARS it was a princess) from a galactic terror The Trade Federation (in STAR WARS it was the evil Empire).",1

George Lucas does extremely well at doing these things.  He just wants to tell a story and add something more to it [the sgi].  The original Star Wars movies did this extremely well, and so did Episode One.  The original movies were, as i hate to admit it, B-Movies, and so was this one.  My Question here is, why does Episode four, five, and six get all the great reviews and Episode one, get bad reviews, when essentially they are the same type of film.",1

Rather than providing an introduction to the Star Wars saga, the film drops you into the middle of a conflict that's not properly unfolded(hence the long intro to the movie), and revolves around a battle that, while a good story on its own, has nothing to do with the Star Wars films we know and love.",0
275,9.0,"One of the things that people say hurt this movie is the lack of a rogue-ish character ala Han Solo. True, but if there were a Han like character in the movie, people would have bitched about lucas not being creative anymore and critics would have reemed him for rehashing the same formula over again. Many people complain about the acting, saying no one acted well. But if you examine the originals, you'll see similar acting. Star Wars isn't about acting, it's about being a kid. It's about getting that warm fuzzy feeling in your stomach when the Fox Fanfare/Lucasfilm logos shine on the screen. It's about having fun. None of the movies are meant to be thinking movies. Want to think? Read a book!  Want to enjoy a choice piece of film filled with action, scenery, effects and story? Watch this or any other Lucasfilm movie (minus Howard the Duck)!",0
276,10.0,I once tried to watch Star Wars movie in theatre and I left in the middle. I don't remember which part it was but it wasn't really fun.

Some characters were funny and was making movie silly like Jar Jar bings as a General. Overall movie is FUN!,0

278,8.0,"This movie puts much of the original trilogy into perspective, but the question remains as to whether or not it and the other prequels were better than the original. With well done music, fine effects, and superb acting, one would think that such a movie would leave little left to say in the terms of how good it was. Alas, this is not such a case. This film was good, I can admit, but it was a tickle compared to the original trilogy. For one thing, there is far too much political meaning and less action than some fans would like. With that, the bulk of the foes seem to be pushovers and little else. But what action sequences there are are certainly ones that are not to miss. All in all, it is well done and worth a look.",1

Characters that are dull and boring. The plot did not put me on the edge of my seat, thank you very much. I do not get how this movie has a rating of 6.5. How?! It doesn't even deserve my kind rating of 1. But unfortunatly, that's all IMDB gives me to rate. And if 1 is ""awful"", this is being to merciful. This was beyond awful. But until then, I'll have to stick with giving it:",0
284,7.0,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I've always thought that The Phantom Menace has been unfairly judged. The Phantom Menace had so much hype and nostalgia that had been built up from the first three movies, that nothing short of perfection could've lived up to it. Is this is a perfect movie? Definitely not. Is this a great movie? No, not really. Is this a fun movie? Yes. A lot of people have problems with the political side to the story in the Star Wars prequels, but I thought that was a good addition, it added a bit to the complexity of the Star Wars universe, making it much less simplistic. Now, I'm not saying the politics couldn't have been handled better, but Lucas certainly had the right idea. The Phantom Menace also gets a lot of heat for being too boring, which I can understand. Parts of this movie drag, but as I've said I do like the political side of Star Wars, so I'm not bothered by having a slower, less action-packed Star Wars movie. Okay, now let's get down to the really tough part: the cast. We all know about Jar- Jar Binks, and no I don't like him, but I will say that as a kid I loved Jar-Jar, so once again, Lucas did succeed partially. He made a character kids would like, he just needed to tone him down a bit and make him a little less... well, y'know. Jake Lloyd gets a lot of grief, but I think he believably portrayed an eight year old, it's the just the fact that Anakin is a kid that really bothers people from what I've gathered. I do think Ewan McGragor and Liam Neeson delivered solid performances and like able characters in this movie. They may not be as good as Han Solo, but their characters had enough subtle personality and characterization to make them interesting. Obviously, the action is the obvious point to bring up when listing positives for the prequels, and I agree. The action is top-notch, and very visually pleasing. I love the effects too, the CGI gives everything a sleek look to it, and the ships look much less clunky than they did in the original trilogy. But those aren't the only things I like about Episode One, the story is a little cluttered, but I think it is a good story. I will admit that Phantom Menace doesn't hold up on its own, you do kind of need the whole saga to really enjoy it, but it's still not as bad as people would have you believe. I also like the characters, though they are a bit bland. I'm not saying I can't understand some of the complaints, what I am saying is that the amount of hate against this movie is ridiculous and unfair, this isn't a bad movie. There I said it.",1
285,10.0,"I love the original films, probably ANH most of all. If you saw it on it's original release you had a cinema experience unlike any other. There just weren't films like this being made. Sure, it drew on films and books of the past, but nothing had looked or sounded like this.",1
286,9.0,"this is wat started my love for movies. I remember when this came out i was so excited and it didn't disappoint. The only problem is that wen ur a little kid, you cant sit long enough to watch this movie. But the action scenes were great. The only reason why i didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because they kill off Darth Maul! He was awesome! He had the double bladed light saber that kicked ass!

289,8.0,"This is one of those movies that I have changed my opinion on as time has passed and one that I think when taken in context of the entire series serves it's purpose quite well. I think when it first came out, I personally had mixed feelings (as did most fans) because it was so different from the original 3 films. However, I love the story it tells. I think this is definitely a movie to watch with the understanding that its simply the backstory of Vader, Palpatine, even Obi Wan and how all of it came together. If its watched with the mindset of ""hey I really want to know how this all started"" then its quite enjoyable. You could argue that there was a lot of wasted time here, like the Senate debates etc., but it fits in with the larger story so I think it all matters. I don't rank it as my favorite Star Wars film, but to me it's right in the middle.",1
290,7.0,'The Phantom Menace' is actually a good movie - with flaws. Most of my complaints stem from the fact that this movie works way better in theaters AND when I was younger.,1
291,5.0,"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a mediocre cast. It's certainly the weakest film in the franchise, which is upsetting since its technically the first, but there's still a lot of good in this film that I think the major fans never think about when they criticize this, Liam Neeson boasts a fantastic performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, his dialogue is terrific and at times quite inspirational even for reality, the soundtrack is once again fantastic, the effects are superb, Darth Maul is a terrific, memorable post-Darth Vader villain (even if his screen time is very limited) and any scene with C3PO, R2D2 or Yoda would bring a smile to any fans face. I will admit this film is a major disappointment for any fan of the franchise and there is honestly much more to complain about than to give praise to, first off the story takes forever to actually get going, over an hour in and we are still in Tatooine watching amateur pod racing, the comic relief is brutal, it's handled with pure class in the original three, but here it isn't even funny, particularly Jar Jar Binks, who is just horror to watch, also the main villain isn't introduced until about ninety minutes in, and is (spoiler ahead) killed off way too early, Darth Maul could have been terrific as the main villain of the entire prequels , serving as this trilogies Vader. I like many of the performances, but there are many, many cringe worthy ones as well, a tone of the characters with brief dialogue deliver it with no charisma, some of the voice actors are uninspired and others are quite racist, Natalie Portman literally just says her lines, and the worst part of the entire movie has to be Jake Lloyd, who is extremely irritating, dosen't say any of his dialogue the way he is suppose to and probably didn't even understand the story, but it isn't his fault really, he was only nine years old, George Lucas clearly couldn't direct him, age is no exception when you're making a movie, you should be telling your actors when they're doing a poor job, and strive to improve them. It has many great moments, but more so there are many imperfections, it's very hard to recommend Star Wars Episode I: the Phantom Menace, but if you're watching the entire series, there is no way it can be missed.

Cracking performance from Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin. Where are you now mate, get back in there...Great story line faultless to the core, ""The planet core""!!!! Sorry just could not resist.

I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right. It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen. The acting was stodgy and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them. Alas, no. Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows. It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer. Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe). They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels.

297,9.0,Top 10 Good and Bad things about Phantom Menace [Minor Spoilers],0
298,9.0,"First,let me start by saying that I have seen all the movies in the Star Wars Series.I have to say George Lucas did not disappoint with this movie.The other two movies were great also. The Phantom Menace was a very good beginning to a very well written series.I also want to comment on the last two movies very briefly before I get to what I thought of the Phantom Menace.I have to say that I love Revenge of the Sith.It is one of my favorite Star Wars movies next to original series Episodes IV,V,And VI. I also liked AOTC a lot,none of the movies disappointed me. So now,I will get to what I thought about the Phantom Menace: Firstly,I thought that all the performances of the main cast were especially good.I liked Natalie Portman as (Queen Padme Amidala)and I also liked Pernilla August as (Shme Skywalker,Anakin's Mother).I also want to comment on Liam Neeson's role as Qui-Gon Jinn he was very good as Obi-Wan's Jedi Master,I also liked Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi,Qui-Gon Jinn's young headstrong Jedi apprentice,however he really didn't have that much to do in TPM but when he did it was big.Ewan McGregors role in the next two movies was a lot larger. He had a lot more to do and say,his action scenes were outstanding!!I also thought that the Supporting cast did very well.I liked the artistry of the planets such as Tatoonie,Naboo and Corusant. I really liked the underwater city that is on Naboo.On Naboo the character of Jar Jar Binks is introduced,I thought that he was funny and I don't understand why people hated him so much.Well they didn't have to worry about it because he wasn't really on the screen that much in AOTC&ROTS.You also see the creation of C-Threepio by a young Anakin played by newcomer Jake Lloyd.You also get to see how C-Threepio and R2-D2 got together. You also get to see Anakin the pilot start to emerge in this movie.The movie shows what it was like before the empire was formed and also how Senator Palpatine(Darth Sidious,Emperor)Ian McDiarmid came to power and also what kind of people Luke and Leia's parents were.(Padme and Anakin) Ian McDiarmid played the role of the evil emperor(Senator Palpatine)flawlessly.It is the introduction of the Republic,""The Jedi""The Sith"" and other characters that will make up the Star Wars universe and it also introduces the Trade Federation.I just want to make a quick comment on the young actor that they got to play Anakin.Jake Lloyd was very good as Anakin Skywalker.After all(Darth Vader)had to start off as an innocent child like anyone else.I don't know why everyone was so critical of the actor,I mean give me a break he is a ""kid"" after all,give him a chance I am sure that as he gets older he will get better as an actor.I liked when it was time for Young Anakin to leave Tatoonie it really was bittersweet.He is upset that he is leaving his mother but he tells her that he will be back for her.However,as you will see when he does finally go back for her it is already to late.I thought those scenes were very powerful.You will see his anger start to emerge at what has happened to his mother but that scene is in the next movie(AOTC).You will see his anger and his conflicting emotions come to a head in the last movie(ROTS).You also see a little bit of the dark side start to emerge in Anakin in (AOTC).Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn meets the young Anakin Skywalker and he feels that he is destined for great things.I also liked the pod-race scenes,it was exciting and the effects were great.The special effects in this movie were very good and they are even better in the next two movies.The Phantom Menace is also the beginning of the love story between Anakin and Padme.It develops in to something really big in AOTC.The costumes in all of the movies were fantastic.Trisha Biggar is a great costume designer.The music in all of the Star Wars movies is great.John William's is a fantastic composer.George Lucas really did really well by getting him to do the musical scores for all of his movies.I liked the music in all of the movies especially the ""Duel of Fates and Anakin's theme"",I also liked Anakin and Padme's love theme in the second movie it was beautiful. I also liked the revised version of""Duel of Fate"" which became the newer version the""Battle of the Heroes""in Revenge of the Sith,the climatic light saber duel between Anakin And Obi-Wan.The light saber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul was great, then you had the duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul which were both outstanding.I also feel that Darth Maul was the ultimate Sith Lord next to the Emperor and of course Darth Vader.Darth Maul really should have been on the screen more then he was.I was rooting for the Jedi to win every time of course.Finally,I think George Lucas did really well for this movie and he is under-appreciated.When are the critics going to wake up and give this Director,Producer the recognition that he so richly deserves.Good start for the lead in movie to the next two movies.Keep up the good work,George.THE FORCE IS INDEED VERY STRONG WITH THIS SERIES.I love all the movies,I will never get tired of watching them.",1

300,9.0,There's just three things I want to say about this film that I forgot in my last comment:,1
301,10.0,"I can under stand many of the complaints about this movie, but I think most people come up with complaints based on others. Recently the prequel trilogy has been receiving bad criticism by many who hardly know what they're talking about. When this movies was newer it(along with the other prequels)was looked upon as better and more exciting than the original trilogy. I knew many many kids who hardly cared about the original trilogy but was obsessed with the prequels. I think many of these individuals have changed their opinions because of what others think about it. I think if you stop comparing it to the originals, which i equally agree are superior,you will realize it is an amazing movie with great characters and settings. The beautiful thing about the phantom menace is that you get to see how the events in the original trilogy came into place.",1
302,8.0,This is probably my 10th time rewatching the Star Wars series from start to finish. I do have to say this is my least favorite but It's hard to discredit the creativity George Lucas put into the screen. I understand fans were disappointed and frustrated with Jar Jar but luckily for us he's only a main character in this film going forward. I think this was a good enough film to receive at least an 8. Plus you can't go wrong with the final light saber scene and the end! Looking forward to watching the rest of the series... again!,0
303,10.0,"This was a great movie and critics did not understand the purpose of it. A Newsweek critic said that everyone expected to see how anakin turned to the dark side and is disappointing not to find that out, well this is another trilogy and of course Darth Vader is not on Episode 1 and I don't think he will appear in Episode 2 either. I think when the trilogy is completed everybody will see the P. Menace as a great film.",1
304,2.0,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of the original three movies, particularly the first two. If George Lucas' name and the title ""Star Wars"" were absent from the poster and ads during the pre-release hype of this film, this overlong wasted 2-hours-of-your-life masquerading as a movie would have miserably bombed at the box office. The best way to sum it up is this: it is as if the filmmaker didn't know anything about Star Wars, except the filmmaker was the writer and director of the original Star Wars films. The result is what you might expect if the Star Wars franchise was turned over to a different production company, as was done in Superman III. However, Lucas did not trade his gold mine for a billion dollars, but instead he may have killed the golden goose. This is probably one of a half-dozen of the biggest disappointments in film history, given the hype, the expectations, and the name surrounding this movie. Sure, it would probably not live up to the originals, even if it was good, but it doesn't work even modestly well as a story. The script needed only about 14 rewrites.",0
305,1.0,"Whatever critics say of this film, it make no difference. People will go and see it. But they will think twice about seeing the sequal. Because this film is poor. At the end of the day the effects are superb, the story line and plot pathetic. Thats all i can say.",0
306,1.0,"This is all special effects and no real story. Top notch actors like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson are forced spew out horrible dialogue and, even worse, they aren't even allowed to spew out the horrible dialogue with passion. Jar Jar Binks is an insult to human intellect as we know it; he doesn't even look like a real creature. In fact, none of the digital characters here do. The backgrounds look real enough, but the digital characters just don't look real. George Lucas has become so blown over by how much easier computers make it that he forgot you still have to make it look real. Not to mention that the story just plain sucks, undermining everything we knew about Star Wars from the first trilogy. It should have been all about the young Obi-Wan Kenobi and him meeting Anakin and them going places and doing stuff. Shame on you, George Lucas.",0
307,9.0,"Wow! Im not sure, but i think that this film is better then episode 4, 5 and 6, i really do!. Anyway, i saw this film at a THX-cinema, and that was quite an experience. I have never seen such cool and nice visual effects!. I also think that the acting was very good, Liam Neeson was very good as Qui-Gon Jinn, Natalie Portman was also very good, but i was disappointed about Samule L. Jackson's role, i thought that he would play a pretty big role, but not. ",1

Anyway, I wasn't fanatical about it when it came out so I didn't mind if I didn't see it for ages and ages after it had been released (so it would come off the 'no free list' and I could be a cheapskate and use one of my free movie tickets) but some friends invited me to the movies...",1

It's not just that Jar Jar is annoying, it's not just that Darth Maul is poorly developed and a thinly-veiled aim at the toys market, it's not just that the ""mitichlorians"" (or however you spell it) is one of the most ridiculous (and unnecessary) story devices of all time, it's not just that this movie could have been a masterpiece for all ages but instead was only palatable by the under-ten crowd or the terminally brand-loyal.

This film follows 2 jedi on their quest to save a planet. I never lose excitement while watching this film. From the opening battle to the introduction of Jar Jar Binks to the exciting pod race, right down to the Gungans vs the Trade Federation and the climactic Duel of the Fates. The acting for the most part was great. Liam Neeson was great as Qui-Gon Jinn, and Ewan McGregor delivers a great performance. Natalie Portman is great as the Queen trying to save her people, Ian McDiarmid is great as the evil Palpatine/Darth Sidious. But Jake Lloyd is the only bad actor in the film, but he portrayed Anakin in his innocence very well. if this was the first Star wars movie to be made, it would be hailed as a masterpiece. Good fun for the whole family, a great addition to the saga, and second in the saga only to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.",1

325,4.0,"When I saw this movie at the theater I initially enjoyed it. I got swept up by the crowd and the light saber battles. Then I saw this movie again and it lost a lot of luster really fast. Now when you watch it, the film is very bland and not very entertaining at all. Other than a somewhat exciting opening scene and a very nice saber battle with the very pointless, but still cool in a way Darth Maul this movie is just a bunch of plot points that will quickly run its course and really has no impact beyond introducing a young Anakin to Obi Wan. The plot has some forces invading this planet we never heard of in the original series. This planet has a rather dumb looking princess and a very annoying race of amphibious creatures that as soon as I saw it I knew it would be the most annoying thing in the film. That is until they meet young Anakin Skywalker so I do believe we had a tie. The rest of the film is just pointless filler getting us to the somewhat enjoyable ending, well about one fourth of it was enjoyable anyway (the saber duel). In the meantime you have a pointless race where you just knew young Anakin was going to win, stupid cameos that make no sense (come on, Anakin making C-3PO, really?), and very bland leads in Liam Neeson as a guy who never existed in the original saga and Ewan as a even more impressively bland Kenobi. Yes, the acting is about as good as watching people in front of blue screens as everyone has no reaction to what they are supposed to be seeing. All this and it culminates with a battle with the creatures that are annoying and robots (I wish the robots won that one), a stupid action scene for the princess (basically an anything a guy can do a little girl can do too set of scenes), an annoying Anakin piloting a ship against the underdeveloped enemy, and one of the few things worth seeing a duel between the Jedi's and Darth Maul. Kind of a shame a movie this bad made as much as it did, but you put light sabers in a movie and name it Star Wars and it would probably easily make 100 million.",0

OK, there are some things that SHOULD have been better: - There was not enough time to develop the characters. - Darth Maul was reduced from a real Jedi-counterpart to a simple villain - In details the movie was too childish Nonetheless, Episode 1 has so much that helped me forget these ""mistakes"" during the movie: It has a superb cast, an excellent music score, really stunning special effects and an exciting story full of action. All in all Episode 1 surely fits not perfect into the Star Wars universe. But you should see it as the first part of a trilogy (as the original Star Wars was, with all its insufficiencies) - and as this, it serves not only well but is a very good start.

Also, Obi Wan is supposed to grow because of the death of his master. He cannot relies on master, ant the time comes when he has to becomes independent.By the way, this movie (Star Wars series) always brings unique villains. Their appearances, the ways of fighting, and characters are differ from each one. I think this is because not only attract audience, but also make the hardships for Jedies.

The Phantom Menace is actually an old fashion space mystery told with modern special effects.  There are more amazingly realistic creatures in this film than in all of the original trilogy.  It is a must see.  The more you see it the more you understand and see things you did not notice before.  This movie pays homage to all the great science fiction movie hits of the past.

342,7.0,"No, the Prequel Trilogy is not as good. Yes, there are countless things(and this has many) to pick at, some downright cringe-inducing. But if you look at them, and try to choose the best parts, I would say that this fits my summary... for the new ones, of course. And we must decide by some system how viewable these are, because, let's face it... an awful lot of us are going to sit down and take them in, in spite of not expecting to be as into them as the OT(original... yeah), and knowing that we won't really be. My two cents? This is the most overall entertaining and re-watchable of the PT. As far as thrilling and fun light-saber swordplay, choreography, execution(in fact, of all six), yup, the best, all the way. The action, in general, receives top marks, as well. The villain... do I need to describe its awesomeness? If you have no idea what I mean, you probably haven't seen the film. The score... magnificent. There are beautiful images in this. But yes, there are awful moments herein... you've likely at least heard of them. The comedy takes a bit of a dive, with more than one piece of toilet humor(and there's a reason the slapstick isn't that popular, although there are exceptions). The acting could be better, but that goes for most of Star Wars(be honest now, people)(meanwhile, Neeson... wonderfully cast). Character writing, especially for the leads, could be more fresh for the franchise. The plot isn't bad, and develops reasonably. The pacing is adequate. The effects are pretty spectacular, if not always real-looking, but it only gets worse in the latter area, and some practical ones are still used here. The dialog is the least embarrassing of these three. The design is great. The DVD has trailers, TV-spots, about twenty(do note that length vary and not all have running times that go beyond ten minutes) featurettes, deleted scenes and a commentary track. I recommend this to fans of the series, George Lucas, and Ray Park(who rocks). 7/10",1

My sister-in-law told me this one was the weakest one so I had no big expectations but the truth is that I really enjoyed it. If this is the weakest one they will probably have a new Star Wars aficionado by the end. I thought the story was more than okay, and that after reading reviews saying the opposite, so no complaint from me here. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it.

Alas, the only thing I can say in my defence is that I am truly a nerd of epic proportions! Now, all kidding aside, unlike many others, I liked the prequel trilogy warts and all.

346,10.0,"It's kind of hard to review this because I don't see this as one movie, but as a chapter part of one larger story. The reason why I say this is cause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to be one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga.

Jar Jar Binks was a disaster, and probably damaged the reputation of this shambles even more. I have never seen such a prime example of commercialism and hype to make a movie a success, it is an insult to young director's who can not raise a measly budget to make their films.

When this first film was on the brink of being released I remember being immediately surprised as casting. Considering the original Star Wars was cast with virtual unknowns George Lucas chose to go with a much more main stream, and successful group of actors.

Who can deny the excitement of the light-saber dueling, the thrill of the pod race, or the sheer beauty of the alien locations?

I loved them because they were great fantasy movies with hundreds of strange creatures,swordfights,adventure,heros,magic (although called Force)and amazing effects. The Phantom Menace beats the old trilogy in all these points. I agree that Jar Jar Binks is not funny but was C-3PO? No the golden gay was not!The digital effects are amazing and the created worlds of Theed,Coruscant and the Gungan World are perfect.Two full-skilled Jedi fighting against armies of droids and an incredible final battle make this movie my favourite.Although I can hardly wait for ""Lord of the Rings"" I'm sure that it will never compete with Episode1,2,3.",1

People complain about the plot, but its actually fairly simple. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to protect the Queen of Naboo because the trade federation who is working with the Sith are trying to kill her. Along the way on Tatooine, they find Anakin Skywalker and free him. Sure, the plot could be better and isn't as good as say...all the other films, but it isn't terrible. The special effects are ten years ahead of its time and there is plenty of eye candy. The action scenes are surely the best of the six films in my opinion, and the final battles are easily the best battles in Star Wars. Only reason it isn't my favorite and is a 9, is because of and I'm sure all you Star Wars fanatics agree: Jar Jar Binks. Enough said there.",1

373,10.0,I thought it was good.  I know having such a young major character did not help the ratings on this film.  The worst part of the whole thing is nobody really cares how Darth Vader came to be except psychologists.  The only downer part from the original 3 Star Wars was when we see Vader take his mask off. Now we have to watch 3 films about his childhood.,0
374,4.0,"""Star Wars--Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" is a perfect example of how even a movie with as much anticipation and reputation as ""Star Wars"" can fall flat on its face if not taken the proper precautions. As I watched the movie fail and flop I though to myself in amazement of how easily the present flaws could have been prevented.  George Lucas must have been perfectly content of his prominence here, and must have thought that hard core fans of his work would except anything, no matter how good or bad, that he would lie in front of their starving faces.",0

381,9.0,"Absolutely incredible movie. I remember when I first saw it. It was so ahead of its time with the special effects used in it. Everything about it is fantastic. From the story's pacing and setting, to the political intrigue that deepens the world, to the mesmerising shots of the various planets, it's all amazing. Pod racing was exhilirating to watch, and Anakin's character is really well done in this movie. Qui-Gon is the only character I would have liked to see more of in the movie, but the scenes he has are all incredible. The Jedi are no longer some old coots blabbering about resisting hate, these guys mean business. They will trick anyone into doing anything that's in their favor. They play political games. They use the Force while fighting to gain the advantage. The fight sequences are just incredible in this movie, especially the fight with Darth Maul. It made me want to own a lightsaber. And Jar Jar is hilarious! Oh man. I crack right up when that dude starts stumbling around. There's nothing really bad about this movie. It's almost perfect, and exactly what Star Wars needs. It's a galactic adventure across multiple planets with an intriguing storyline, fun twists, interesting characters, and an ominous feeling of what is to come being build up all the while. We should have more scenes with the characters exploring the strange planets they visit in Star Wars, like it was done in this movie with the underwater passages and the desert world traders. Highly recommended, a strong contender for the best movie in the whole Star Wars franchise!",1

389,8.0,"When I was younger I would tell others, I wish there were more Star Wars films. In 1999 my wish came true when Lucas decided to create The Phantom Menace, The first of the 3 pre-quels. This film is action packed; and superb acting from veteran actors Neeson, MacGregor, and Mc Diarmid. In my opinion too much CGI can ruin films, but it's cheaper and cost efficient.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace begins when Supreme Chancellor Valorium ( Terrance Stamp) sends two Jedi Qui-Gon Gen( Liam Neeson), and His apprentice, Obi-Wan-Kenobi ( Ewan Mac Gregor), to negotiate with the Trade Federation. When the negotiations fail, because Darth Sidious ( Ian Mc Diarmid) tells Viceroy Gunray to eliminate the Jedi.<br /><br />When the Jedi escape they flee to the planet Naboo. Once there they are caught in the middle of a ground invasion. It's a droid army invasion ordered by Darth Sidious. When Qui-Gon is escaping he saves a local Gun-Gun. Gun-Gun's also live on Naboo, but are considered 2nd class by the Nebuians. Qui-Gon ask Jar Jar( Amehd Best) to be taken to see the leader of the Gun-Gun's. Jar Jar Binks is strange, and was banished because of his clumsiness. The three go to the secret underworld city, where Qui-Gon talks to Boss Nass, the Gun-Gun leader. There he realizes that Jar-Jar is to be axed, but Qui-Gon explains that Binks owes him a life-debt. Boss Nass is lets Jar jar go with the 2 Jedi and provides them transportation through the planets core. Jar Jar navigates them, to the top of Naboo. Once they arrive they rescue Queen Padme Amidala ( Natalie Portman), who is leader of Naboo. She is watching her people suffer, and is being pressured to sign a treaty against her will. Once the Jedi find the queen, she flees with the Jedi in her Nubian Star Ship. ",1
390,8.0,"This new Star Wars episode was fantastic, but I did not find it as good as the old trilogy. However, I did like this episode very much. I think that anyone that likes any sort of action movie would be pleased with this movie. It also had plenty of fantasy - it took place in a different galaxy and it had very advanced technology. It has many different battles going on, especially in the end - a space battle, a sword battle, a gun battle, and a war. It has a good storyline, and once you see the first episode, you'll be wanting to see them all. It also had some amazing creatures, such as the gungans. These creatures that they created were great - you need a lot of imagination to create characters like those. Well, that's about it. If you would like a movie with even more action, check for episodes two and three.",1
391,1.0,"The movie's rating on this site proves that George Lucas need not do anything more than take a crap in a paper bag and people will love it. I was young enough when this came out in the theater to be genuinely excited about seeing it. I stood in line for hours and the whole bit. I went in thinking this was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread and came out cursing the day George Lucas was born. This was so shockingly bad that I boycotted the rest of the series until a few years ago when I was forced to watch them by my Star Wars obsessed wife. First of all, casting a child in ANY role, let alone a lead role, is dangerous territory to be treading on, but I know there was no choice in this case. However, can you at least cast someone who can act? This kid was so annoying it made me want to go upstairs and destroy the projector. There are so many awful aspects to this movie that they can't all be listed here, but Jar-Jar Binks is easily the most annoying character ever devised. Whoever created it must be living in a bunker somewhere because I assume there plenty of p*ssed off people looking for revenge. Both Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are talented actors, but they sleepwalk through this performance, and with good reason. Would you be proud if you were acting in this?",0
392,1.0,"This is simply an awful movie: the acting is terrible (with the sole exception of Anikan's mother), the characters unsympathetic and unlovable (Jar Jar Biggs, or whatever, may very well be the worst character ever portrayed in a movie), and the story both lame and incoherent.

393,7.0,Don't know why this film doesn't have as good reviews as the first 3 Star Wars film. This film is very entertaining. Many memorable characters. The visual effects and CGI is great.

394,7.0,Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**,0
395,10.0,This movie is really good becuase it is. It is the best Star Wans movi it is way better then the other ones so yah,1
396,7.0,"star wars: episode 1 was very disapointing. mainly because it was so unengaging. the movie was very hard to follow and often confusing. the fact that it had a kid in it also contributed to its boringness. you could practically sleep through it and not miss any point of interest. jar jar binks didn't help the film much either. i found him to be an annoying jamaican sounding, goat looking, goon. sure, the computer effects were good but all the C.G.I. in the world couldn't save it. it was also far too predictable. we all knew that qui qon quack was going to die a horrible death. don't get me started on darth small. he may have delivered his one line perfectly but it really needed to follow up on that. and my final point, what does a trade federation have to do with star wars. this film was quite simply a mess from start to finish. absolute drivel",0
397,,"Dear Mr. Lucas,",0
398,9.0,I think this is the first of a trilogy that didn't harm the Star Wars franchise like the new stuff has. The film is really great with new elements such as the pod racing and the start of how Annikin becomes Darth Vader. It has everything you want to be a Star Wars movie.,1
399,7.0,"The assessment of the Star Wars films seem to be all upside down. To my mind, The Empire Strikes Back from the original trilogy is by far the worst of the six, but it is universally judged to be the best. On the other hand, The Phantom Menace is universally derided, and yet I find it to be the best. It is beautifully scripted; the pace is handled to perfection. The acting all round is superb. The special effects are dazzling, and only gratuitous in the sense that there are too many ugly aliens walking around the periphery. Since this is a problem with all the Star Wars films, TPM should be commended for being restrained, in fact. At least it minimises the ugliness factor by giving the alien characters depth and verisimilitude (utilizing CGI to its limits). Otherwise the effects serve the story very well. Other than the original film, this is the only instalment that never becomes boring and is always engaging.",0
400,9.0,"I read the novel before I saw the film opening day, so I mostly knew what to expect. I was not disappointed. I've seen it five times now, and between each viewing I think about the flaws it has, but when I see the film again, I remember why I wasn't disappointed. The reason is the same reason I love the original trilogy: great storytelling. Sure, The Phantom Menace has flaws, but as an overall film, it's great. One of the best films to come out in a very long time I think. I just think that some people forget why they like movies: for a good story. Isn't that what Citizen Kane was all about?",1
401,8.0,The atmosphere created in this movie really goes to show how talented Lucas is as a filmmaker and how successful some of his direction comes to be. The Phantom Menace introduces a living and breathing world that creates the enchanting effect that the story we're witnessing is just a part of history that we are lucky enough to encounter. His choice to film in such wide and off centre shots makes the movie feel like a documentary of sorts and getting to see characters doing their own things in the backgrounds of these shots (a lot of the time with jar jar) adds to this effect aswell.,1
402,9.0,"I would like to start right away with the fact that the second (now the ""second"", before that there was a ""new"", but after the ""third"" trilogy it became the ""second"") trilogy is my favorite. The story of Anakin Skywalker is very close to me, the development of events here is much more thoughtful, and the political subtext adds much more depth to this initially fabulous story about Star Wars. The new films perfectly show how politics breaks destinies. But about everything in order.",1
403,6.0,"The beginning of the prequel trilogy kicks off with a lot of space politics from the prologue itself. Tax increases, trade blockades, senatorial bureaucracy and planetary invasion plans lay the groundwork for this new story featuring 2 powerful Jedi Knights who play a role as peacekeepers.",1
404,7.0,"When I first watched this film in theaters, I was very excited cause I was gonna watch Star Wars! I was surprise with this chapter. I was only nine . So as I was all grown up , I've notice that there were many problems with this chapter of Star Wars and I was disappointed.",0
405,9.0,"First off, I can understand why some people were disappointed with this movie: all the advanced hype created advanced expectations that were impossible to meet.  However, I can say that my expectations were more than met when I saw this movie.  That's probably because I didn't have unreasonable expectations going in.  Since this was a ""Star Wars"" movie, I wasn't expecting really deep story-telling or Oscar caliber acting.  All I was expecting was that the film would provide me with two hours of exceptional entertainment like the first trilogy did and I felt ""The Phantom Menace"" succeeded admirably in that respect.  The film contains some of the most phenomenal effects I have ever seen, spectacular action scenes and another great score from John Williams.  So, it seems to me that this film delivered everything the first three films did.  There were flaws, however. The film doesn't really stand on its own (but really, only ""A New Hope"" does) and seems like a teaser for the rest of the saga.  The acting is competent for the most part, but everyone has moments (some more than others) where they are pretty mediocre.  There is also the tendency for banal dialogue.  In other words, this film has more or less the same flaws as the earlier films.  As for the complaints that this was a ""kiddie"" film, remember that the ""Star Wars"" movies are supposed to be family films.  A family film MUST appeal to children as well as containing elements that adults can enjoy.  Since I highly enjoyed this film, I conclude that TPM is a great family movie.  One last thing: I liked Jar Jar Binks for most of the film.  I just think he needs to be toned down a bit for the next installments.",1
406,,"I hesitate to say anything bad at all about the latest Star Wars flick. But ...Star Wars Episode 1 is a disappointment. And I'm a fan of Sci Fi movies and of the original three films, even if they do look dated these days.",0
407,10.0,"No one could boast that The Phantom Menace was the greatest movie ever created, but did Mr. Lucas ever intend it to be that? Rather, he created a brilliantly imaginative visual display set to entertain rather than enlighten. So why is everyone so critical of the aspects of the film it was never meant to achieve? No one ever said the Godfather was boring because it lacked comic relief. This is a Star Wars film, it's not just a movie, it's a phenomenon. It transcends the basic criteria for a good movie. A Star Wars movie stands out for one reason: ITS EFFECTS!!! Sure character development, dialogue and plot are important, but in this case, these are secondary qualities. The most important is the imagination, the new world it creates for us before our eyes, rather than the psychological messages between the lines. For this reason, this movie delivers. We are dealing with a series, not one installment compacted in a movie. Therefore, the character development, dialogue and plot are meant to unravel extra slowly and tantalizingly for the audience to enjoy them as thoroughly as possible. I ended up liking the movie for what it was, a visually stunning, exciting exhibition of enjoyable scenes and actors. Sure I didn't leave the cinema with any new lessons in life but I came out happy and refreshed. The critics couldn't get it more wrong, or should I say more inappropriate. They judged the movie for all the wrong guidelines, as though they were expecting Braveheart in space. My advice is go in, expecting only a fabulous time. This movie is not just a movie, it is an experience and make it so without looking for flaws in direction, corny dialogue or second-rate acting. Sit back, open your eyes and have fun, and this way you'll actually enjoy it instead of wasting time and money pulling it into pieces. Even if you do find faults, you'll realise that the flaws of this one can be forgiven unlike the 'movie' of some crappy boat which sank in the water to everyone's delight.",1
408,7.0,"This film opens new trilogy in the Star Wars Universe that tells about life's path of Anakin Skywalker. I think that this film is the worst one of prequals. Firstly, the plot is good but sometimes some scenes take too much time and it looks very boring. Secondly, the cast and characters are great, Darth Maul is one the best villain in all saga. But Ja Ja Binks is one of the most annoying character (expecting main characters in new trilogy). Thirdly, the visual effects are wonderful, of course, they are much better than in the first film.<br /><br />So, this film has a lot of good moments and a lot of disadvantages.",0
409,,"Unlike most people,I actually quite like the plots of the prequels;I think the political intrigue and the way Emperor Palpatine gains control of the senate,is clever in the way it mirrors real world despots and it helps add an air of realism which is an important and underrated quality in sci-fi/fantasy films.",1

413,8.0,"The first episode of an epic trilogy, taking us through life on a complete different galaxy. The film introduces us with mystical characters, unique weaponry and various planets. The film begins with the famous words 'In a galaxy far far away...' which advanced to be somewhat a tradition in Star Wars films to come. Following the famous blue text is a small synopsis on the current situation of the galaxy and what is yet to come, this played in unison to the famous theme song by the Boston Pops orchestra and John Williams. We soon find out that the trade federation are planning a full-scale invasion on Naboo, leaving the planets queen Padmé Amadila vulnerable. Chancellor Valorem sends Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi to negotiate with the great Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. Qui-Gon Jinn is portrayed across the film as a wise, protecting knight who easily finds the force in people. Firstly, his apprentice Obi Wan seems very mature and well-trained, suggesting he has taught him well, we see his leadership skills flourish when he and Obi Wan fight off an army of droids convincingly destroying every last bot in the vicinity. The number of droids increase profusely and during the invasion, Jinn saves Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks from being run over by a droid transport. Jar Jar is best known for is distinctive voice and his bubbly nature; the creature is mastered by Ahmed Best - the American actor features in three Star Wars films as the Gungan. Jar Jar takes them away from the war zone and to the underwater city of Otah, persuading leader Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers, but the Jedi's along with Jar Jar are unsuccessful. For his navigation skills, Binks leaves Otah with Jinn and Kenobi. The three head to the planet set to be blockaded by the Trade Federation: Naboo, and rescue Naboo's queen Amidala, escaping from the planet with Padmé facing down on her set to be destructed home. They aim to take her to the Republic Capital: Coruscant, however, the ship sustains damage and the hyperdrive is in need of repair - they stop off in Tatooine, a land situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Queen Padmé Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) is described as a loyal, enthusiastic leader, willing to stand up for what she believes in. Her selfless nature allows her to make decisions on what is best for her people. Despite her evident glamorous lifestyle, she is in no real need of protection, we see her handle a pistol comfortably and show no sign of fear when doing so, this down to her confidence and self-belief. She, alongside Jar Jar, Qui-Gon and droid R2-D2 visit the desolate settlement Mos Espa to be necessary equipment. They encounter the animated, no-nonsense flying creature Watto, who is the shop owner, and his 9 year old slave - Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who created the protocol droid C3PO. Qui-Gon Jinn senses a strong presence of the force in young Anakin and is curious to what he is capable of, Jinn is convinced that he is the prophesied ""Chosen one"". Unable to collect the required equipment the Jedi Knight negotiates a wager with Watto: Anakin's freedom and parts for the hyperdrive in a pod race. Despite a frightening start to the race, the 9 year old won in style and not long after left behind his mother Schmi to train and become a Jedi. En route to the Starship, Qui-Gon is greeted by Darth Maul (Darth Sidious' apprentice) who intends to capture Padmé. Jinn ensues a lightsaber battle with Maul, as Padmé is escorted onto the ship. Maul's red lightsaber a powerful weapon with blades either side of the casing, in contrast to Jinn's single green blade, stemming upward from the casing. Qui-Gon quickly disengages and escapes onboard the ship. The starship lands on Coruscant, meaning Padmé can plead her people's case to Valorem and the Galactic senate. The significance in the name of Chancellor Valorem, coming from the noun 'valour' which defines as someone with great courage in the face of danger, especially in battle. Jinn on the other hand asks the Jedi Council (Yoda, Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto etc) for permission to train young Anakin Skywalker - the council refuses, concerned that he is vulnerable to the dark side of the force. Qui-Gon vows to take up Anakin as his own apprentice. Young Anakin beams with confidence and is rather impertinent to others, perhaps gaining this nature from Watto. The 9 year old does possess large qualities, attributes made for a Jedi, reasoning why Qui-Gon believed so strongly in him. Naboo's senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Valorem to elect a more capable leader and resolve the crisis. Padmé returns to Naboo, frustrated with the corruption in the senate. Qui-Gon and Obi Wan are ordered by the Jedi council to go with the Queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct. The Jedi Council are a group of elite Jedi Knights, who's best times are slightly behind them but still own a great level of wisdom and knowledge of the force. The council is in charge of protecting those in need of protection and prevent any threat that may evolve from the Dark side of the force. Their role in assigning Jedi's to carry out missions is all in the aim to bring peace and prosperity to the galaxy. On Naboo, Padmé reveals herself to the Gungans as Queen Amidala and persuades them to join in an allegiance against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar Binks is promoted to General and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army. The clash takes place on green land, surrounded by hills and above is a clear sky, the droids enter the playing field in their dozens, pouring onto land to face the fierce, vicious Gungans. During the battle, Qui-Gon, Obi Wan and Anakin are situated in the Starship, Jinn tells Anakin to wait in the cockpit of a vacant Starfighter. Darth Maul has infiltrated the palace and appears with his lightsaber. His appearance is intimidating to say the least, with 9 horns engraved on the top of his head, black and red tattoos cover the surface of his skin but most alarming is the Sith's eyes - yellow and red - piercing straight through his opponent. The villain engages in combat with the two Jedi's. In an incredible sequence of strikes for and against each character, Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon Jinn with his lightsaber, but is then bisected by Obi Wan and falls down a pit. Anakin has inadvertently triggered the starfighter's autopilot, travelling to the battle against the droid army. Young Skywalker blundered into the control ship's hangar and caused its destruction from within before escaping, deactivating the droid army in the process. After the duel, Qui-Gon requests Obi Wan to train Anakin, and dies in his arms. Palpatine is elected chancellor and Obi Wan is promoted by Yoda to a Jedi Knight. Nute Gunray, the figure who conspired with the Sith Alford Darth Sidious to launch the blockade and subsequent invasion of Naboo, was arrested. Yoda reluctantly in behalf of the Jedi council, accepted Jinn's request to train Anakin as a Jedi, making him Obi Wan Kenobi's apprentice. Obi Wan Kenobi, or Ben Kenobi, is as I mentioned before, extremely mature and conveys levels of wisdom. The force is strong with the Jedi and shows the courage worthy of being a Jedi Knight. His promotion is no surprise, allowing the character to manifest his leadership qualities and be the catalyst of the making of the "" Chosen one"". In a celebratory parade, Queen Padmé Amidala presents a gift of thanks and appreciation to Boss Nass and the Gungans in their help to establish peace in the Galaxy. An iconic film and opener to the start of the Star Wars journey. We are confronted with a whole new Galaxy of things. The lightsaber's are a brilliant concept and are a major selling point within the film. The variation of casings, colours and designs don't go unnoticed and how they are used in combat scenes is a great spectacle. The idea of the Jedi council and the prophesied ""chosen one"" questions whether Anakin will meet his fate, keeping viewers invested for the next adventure. The settings used in the film are eccentric and intrigue the naked eye, from the famous underwater city of Otah, to the desolate, barren desert of Naboo. A great picture and a special watch.",1

Except I think this film was better than either the Star Wars film that came before (""Revenge Of The Jedi"") or after (""Attack Of The Clones."") More than that, ""Phantom Menace"" is good. Not great, but good.",1
423,6.0,I really wish I could say a lot of good things about this movie but I really can't.  This movie is a Saturday morning children's TV version of a real Star Wars movie.,1
424,6.0,"I suppose I should start calling this ""Confessions of a Star Wars Virgin""... Anyway, I've finally come to the much-maligned prequel series and a movie that gets considerable hate, The Phantom Menace. Maybe because I don't esteem the Star Wars film as the greatest films of all time, or maybe I just have lower standards than most, but I found The Phantom Menace to be the most fun Star Wars movie yet. Yes, there are enormous flaws with Episode I, but like every other film in the series, the good moments don't just excuse the bad; they topple them. The Phantom Menace follows Jedi Knight Qui- God Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they escort Queen Amidala on her travels to the planet Coruscant, hoping to find a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. They also encounter Anakin Skywalker, before he became a Jedi, who appears to have unusually strong powers of the Force. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie based on how much hate it has received. Being the first movie in a trilogy, The Phantom Menace is going to feature a lot of exposition and many seemingly stock characters. I would hope many of the plot lines and character arcs are continued in the next couple of movies because, but I have to at least give it the benefit of the doubt for now. The movie's good moments made me completely forget many of the bad ones that came before it. The pod race in particular was stunning as well as the final fight with Darth Maul; showing the Jedi in their prime made the lightsaber fights more fast-paced and exciting. Even though I enjoyed the movie, I can completely understand the hatred it has accumulated over the years. If I was a big fan of the original series, and I had to wait sixteen years for this, I would be pretty disappointed as well. Maybe being a Star Wars virgin allowed me to enjoy Episode I more than I should have, but, at least for me, The Phantom Menace was the most visually impressive and maybe even the most fun Star Wars movie yet by continuing to showcase the series' creativity and imagination.",1
425,,"This is the film that Lucas proclaims as his original vision for the original Star Wars.  What a load of rubbish.  The original Star Wars, (or now called Episode IV: Star Wars: A New Hope) is much better.",0
426,10.0,"Many fans were greatly disappointed with 'The Phantom Menace"" when it first hit theaters. New concepts, new Jedi, and much dramatic lightsaber duels. No, the prequels didn't look or feel like the original trilogy. However, the prequels weren't supposed to feel like the originals. This was a different time and a different Jedi code. The reason 'The Phantom Menace' is so important is because of one character alone: Qui-Gon Jinn. Qui-Gon Jinn is arguably the only real Jedi in the entire Star Wars saga. Jinn followed the force in its truest form. Yes, Yoda and Obi-Wan were powerful Jedi - however, they allowed themselves to be entangled in political affairs. Qui-Gon followed only the code of the force - ultimately preventing him from being on the council. Rewatching this film, you can see (and hear) the genius of it. Look past Jar Jar Binks and notice the greatness at play. During what the majority of Star Wars fans still consider to be the greatest lightsaber duel of all time, you can hear the force interrupt Qui-Gon Jinn's ability to use the force (listen closely after the red laser wall opens and Jinn and Maul start to battle again. You can see Jinn's confused face and inability to duel as well as he should)- ultimately allowing Darth Maul to stab Jinn in the gut with his saber. We now know Qui-Gon Jinn is the reason why Jedi never die, and that he was the one who discovered the path to Jedi immortality - making Qui-Gon Jinn the most important character in Star Wars history. The force interrupted Jinn's ability to use it because Jinn was the force's last true follower. The force chose him to help bring balance to it. And that is the true genius of George Lucas at play. Next time you watch 'That Phantom Menace, ' make sure to appreciate Qui-Gon Jinn. The last true Jedi.",1
427,6.0,"I once came across a complaint concerning an early scene in Episode I, wherein the two main Jedi drink tea, cited as evidence of the director losing sight of what makes the Star Wars films so exciting. Yet the subsequent sequence includes the sight of two Jedi fighting side by side, blaster bolts deflected in rapid succession, a lightsaber plunged into a metal door to melt it, and eerie insect-like machines with shield generators. How many upgrades to things in the original films were crammed into this one sequence?",1

429,4.0,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is a colossal disappointment. It is the fourth (or first, in saga chronology order and according to its title) Star Wars movie and the starting entry of a prequel trilogy fully written and directed by Star Wars creator George Lucas. Now the original trilogy, need I say it, is composed of three of the most original science-fiction movies ever made and two of the best films ever made. That trilogy is over. The prequels' point is to tell the story of Darth Vader, how he became one of the screen's most detestable villains. The whole trilogy is a disappointment, but ""The Phantom Menace"" is the worst of the bunch. Lucas decided to transform the series from a powerful, story-packed narrative to basically a chaste videogamy extravaganza...poorly-written, to add another fault.",0

432,1.0,"More or less everything worthwhile in The Phantom Menace can be attributed to the cinematographer. In addition, the computer effects are clearly impressive, and whoever choreographed the fight scenes gets some props too. However, don't let its staunch defenders fool you -- nothing else is any good at all. The characters are trite and undeveloped, the acting is unremarkable to poor, and the dramatic arc is nonexistent. It felt to me like the movie was still just beginning until half way through the final sequence -- nothing that felt like a plot had happened yet, so I had assumed that the real action was yet to begin. In addition, many plot and character decisions are totally disloyal to the original series. I will elaborate below, but DO NOT READ FURTHER if you don't want anything given away.",0

The story is slower than the other Star Wars movies, but necessarily so, in that this introduces us to the characters and sets us up for what is to come. Perhaps this is why this movie was such a disappointment to so many fans of this saga. I also have to admit, it is my least favorite of the six movies, but this is not a bad thing. I also hate that it is my least favorite for all the wrong reasons. It is not typical STAR WARS fare, but, again, let me repeat, this does not mean it is bad. In fact, this movie shows that George Lucas is a darn good story writer and not just some whiz kid on special effects who has no talent for anything else. And as far as I'm concerned, the worst of STAR WARS is more often than not better than the best of everything else. 9 out of 10.",0

Nevertheless once I knew what was happening I got stuck into the movie. I can understand why people dislike Jar Jar Binks but I personally like and always have. The kid who played Anakin, I really have nothing against him. The only problem I would say is that the CGI in one of the scenes is a bit off but it was the 90s and the CGI was amazing for that time and still is good to this day.

The actors are the best for this movie all of them starting from Liam Neeson and ending with Ray Park. This is huge start up for beginners in Star Wars universe, I recommend to start with this movie.

444,6.0,"Otherwise known as ""Star Wars-Episode One"" - the 1st chapter in what is now planned as a 6-part movie series. The 2nd chapter arrived in 2002. So all we have here is basically an introduction to a 12-hour movie. And boy, do we feel it. The plot has something to do with heavy taxes being perpetrated by the nasty 'Trade Federation.' Two Jedi Knights are dispatched to negotiate. It doesn't go well. We are (re-) introduced to R2D2 & C3PO (who is being built by young Annakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader - Eegads!). In the end, we have a huge battle on 3 fronts, highlighted by the light-saber duel between the 2 Jedi knights and Darth Maul - a Sith Lord. Why are they all fighting? And why not send 4 Jedi knights or 6, to simplify matters a bit? All the escalating problems in the next two films could have been avoided if the so-called wise Jedi Council distributed their warriors a bit more efficiently, rather than being stuck in this '2' mode. To me, the most interesting aspects of this flic is making the various connections between this movie and the ones already made which take place in the near future. For example, there is the other Sith Lord (the master - they always come in twos ... say what? - if you know they come in twos, then send four..never mind), who is obviously the evil emperor from ""Return of the Jedi""(83), and played by the same actor. Then there's the hint that Annakin did not have a father - what's all that about? And these microscopic beings that live in everyone's blood symbiotically? Hah? Like ""Star Trek the Motion Picture""(79), this film is easier to watch a 2nd time around, when one can relax and not worry about missing a line of dialog which explains half the plot. The obvious weakness to the flic is that after writing it, George Lucas doesn't have much directing to do: what's left is for his FX technicians to plan the high-speed action races, create the many creatures, and visualize the city-scapes on several worlds. By Golly. And I didn't even mention Jar-Jar once.",0

Acting in this movie is very good, especially Ewan McGregor,Liam Neeson and Ian Mcdiarmid. The others acting was ok. The cgi is pretty decent some parts, but weak in some parts. Story is very interesting. Planets design was great. The characters are mostly good. Darth Maul was awesome. Now let's begin with the negatives. Jar Jar. This character gets a lot of hate and i don't see why. Yes, this character is badly written, but the voice is pretty good and i don't see why people call him a bad character. He isn't a bad one, he's a stupid character. As i mentoined, the Cgi was weak some parts, especially Jar Jar's CGI. Anakin is a really boring character and got way too much screentime. The Race was entertaining but it was too long and it looked like George Lucas didn't had what to put in this movie. The final battle was amazing and the duel between Obi Wan, Qui Jon and Darth Maul couldn't get any better. This movie gets too much hate and IMO it's a good beginning for the Star Wars saga.",0

452,10.0,"I heard a lot of pre-movie hype, about how ""It sucks, it's going to suck, it has to suck, no one can make 4 good movies in a series in a row, it can't measure up to the originals!""  Well, if George Lucas had tried to make it measure up to the original, people would have just been saying, ""It's a cheesy remake!""  You can't please all the people all of the time, but I have to think of it like this.  I never got to see the originals in the theatres, because my parents were convinced by the religious zealots they associated with that ""Star Wars"" had to do with the ""New Age"" movement, and was therefore evil.  I had to wait until the ""Special Edition"" release to see them in the theatres, and they were just as good to me, I think, as they would have been if I had been seeing them on the big screen as a kid, even though I had seen them on video several times over the years.  We need to remember that there will kids there who are seeing a ""Star Wars"" film for the first time, and this will seem like magic to them, even if YOU think it sucks, because you are older and know better, and because it doesn't have Luke, Han, Leia, etc. etc.  I thought it was great, and no amount of know-it-all fans are going to convince me otherwise.  The underwater scene was incredible, MacGregor and Neeson were great, as was Portman.  Lloyd, contrary to ""those in-the-know,"" was good too.  The effects were better than ever, which is not surprising, as most modern special-effects are based on those pioneered by George Lucas for his first Star Wars film, because there was no one out there doing what he needed.  See it with an open mind, and remember, it is the first part of three that preceed those we already know. Sure, most things seemed shiny and new in the movie, whereas they had ""used and battered"" look in the other three, but remember, this is a prosperous time, during the ""Old Republic,"" before the dark age brought on under the rule of the Empire.  I liked it, and I am sure I will like the other two, as well as episodes VII, VIII, and IX.  It's another story from another time, and not to be judged on the merits of other actors and stories that take place after.  By itself, it is great.  As a part of a larger story, it is good too.  That's my opinion, and I'll stick by it.",1

463,10.0,"based on other comments on this site, this movie should have been terrible. They were all wrong. Now to set a few things straight. George Lucas is not racist. The guy who did Jar Jar's voice was given the job because his voice was ideal for the character. Also, Jar Jar was not annoying. He was different that in other star wars films, but what about the elephant creature who played the piano in the bar? what about the Ewoks or the Jawas? None of them are what older people want in a movie- they are thought of as ""cute"" and ""immature"" but is there really anything wrong with that? Jar Jar lightens the film and adds a few slightly comical parts. He is not that bad and does not ruin the movie. Also, people complained about the acting. News flash! this is a Star Wars movie. If you want acting go see ""A Beautiful Mind"" or some phylosophical movie like that. This movie is supposed to be an entertaining Sci-fi film, not an oscar winning film. One more thing, there was nothing wrong with the effects. I thought they were very well done. why don't you try to go home and make a sequence like the pod race. and no, the pod race was not to long. It was fun to see and the effects were dazzling. It was not a waste of film. The people who did not like this movie need to remember that it is a PG which should also appeal to kids, not an R that is targeted to adults. Lucas knew this when he used Jar Jar, and Anakin and other once again ""immature"" characters. I enjoyed this movie and don't understand where all the complaints are coming from.",0

I think this episode is a constant joy, constant magic and excitement, and it has it's fair share of mystery and emotion too. It's an all around great film, and a great Star Wars film - and I honestly - ESPECIALLY now, don't think Lucas could of started the story off any better. People complain about it being kid friendly and overly happy and all that, but it's mainly for contrast reasons - it's the whole point. I expected the galaxy to be a more happier and lush place, I expected a more lighthearted atmosphere, ...and that's what it gave. It's the Pride Lands before Scar (the Empire) takes over. You can't introduce a world that's going to fall apart and be shrouded in darkness, in a six part saga no less, all dark and creepy right off the bat; where would the emotion come from when everything actually does go to hell?

A new SW-world opened as I sat amazed in the darkness. From the opening Jedi swashbuckling to the end fight with Darth Maul (man, did I love that), through the return to Tatooine and the jaw-dropping pod race, I never sunk into any second thoughts.

477,9.0,"Episode 1-the phantom menace is much more Flash Gordon and serialized than Star Wars fans might have expected, unlike 4-6, this film is lots of exposition and character introductions. If seen with all the pre-conceived ideas and ""this isn't how I thought it would be"" bull its not great, if viewed on its own merit, I think Phantom Menace is one of the best films ever.",1
478,,"Its 1983 and one of the most visually appealing Star Wars movies ever, has been released. The film is Return of the Jedi. We have some of the best set pieces ever commited to celluloid and we see the culmination of characters we have cared about since 1977. We finally see Anakin Skywalker return to the good side and the galactic war is at an end.many years pass then its announced that George Lucas, will create a whole new trilogy, chronicling the life of Anakin Skywalker and explain just why he turned to the `dark side'. The release of the star wars trilogy: special edition only increases the expectation for Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and so it begins. The year is 1999 and the movie begins. Does it start off with General Kenobi and Anakin facing off in the Clone Wars? Does George Lucas enthuse it with hard core mythologizing from the start? Do we find out how good Anakin was as a pilot from the very first frame? Nope.George Lucas goes back to basics. Return of the Jedi was the last film where we had an intergalactic war, but this film is essentially about a small planet being attacked by a Greedy trade federation. Doesn't sound too star warsy does it? Well not on the surface. To fully appreciate this movie you have to accept its not going to the rip roaring roller coaster ride that the originals were. By their very nature they were extremely exciting adventures with characters on the run . In this film, we have a peaceful galaxy as opposted to galaxy engulfed in a intergalactic war spanning hundreds of planets, instead its one planet. That of Naboo, which has came under attack from a Trade Federation. So why start with this planet? Well, Senator Palpatine is the senator from there and as we know, Palpatine, just like Lucas for introducing the films at this unexpected episode is genius for planning ahead. Upon its release, many movie goers attacked Jar Jar what with his bumbling nature he was hardly your typical star wars character and unlike the previous movies, he even had the audacity in acting the fool in the final space battle. But people who let themselves get distracted by this, mis-interpret it and thus, take an instant disliking to the film. But concentrate on what many perceive it to be its flaws and you see that it's the films and overall, the trilogys greatest strength.  It shows how even the smallers things can have a bearing on the bigger picture, from a small time senator of Naboo promoted to the ruler of the galaxy and how the Jedi Knights trigger a count down to their own destruction, by taking a young boy away from his mother. George Lucas should be given credit for trying to do things differently and not hanging off the coat tails of his original films. Had we seen a Han Solo character in this movie like many wanted then it would have cheapened the real Han Solo.  Likewise, many other circumstances which fans wanted in the movie. Sure, the characters dialogue is more stilted, but this is the Victorian area of the star wars universe (you will notice the dialogue loosens up somewhat in Episode 2). So basically, the galaxy is peaceful but theres a few things rumbling and its these smaller things which will shape every film following it. A great epilogue for the star wars movies and a movie which compliments the other films, as opposed to blatantly copying their style and therefore, robbing them of their originality. 3 Stars out of Five.",1
479,,"I, too, am irritated by countless critics and ""Star Wars Fans"" that have picked this movie apart, sighting racial undertones, bad story, and bad acting, to name a few. There is a real world parallel here......Anything, I think of a politician in particular, under such scrutiny, is bound to have flaws in him/her, or IT, as is the case with TPM. This new Star Wars movie had almost unlimited expectations, and as a result, almost unlimited scrutiny. Sure, the movie isn't flawless, but so many people, it seems, went to see this movie for the express purpose of finding something wrong with it. George Lucas thought of, wrote, directed, and paid for this movie himself. It is HIS vision, and HIS story to tell as he sees fit. To look so hard for fault with his story is rude. How many kids, after hearing a scary story in the dark at summer camp, dissect the story, and analyze what they think might have made it better, or look for hidden meaning where there is none? Certainly none that I went to camp with. I applaud Mr. Lucas for sticking to his ideal of making movies for people that like to watch movies, I certainly enjoyed this movie, and will be among the first in line to see the next. Sadly, I'll probably be in line right behind those same people....waiting to dissect, analyze, and be the first to find something wrong with someone else's story.

482,9.0,"Episode 1 has been cited as one of the biggest disappointments in cinema. Or maybe because people expected too much out of it? I don't know, all I'm saying is that this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time behind Jaws. The story is more mature than all of the Star Wars films, it's about how the Trade Federation wants the Chancellor to sign a treaty to trade routes of the Galactic Republic, but she refuses, and so there is huge chaos around the decision. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi plan to train a young Anakin Skywalker. This film is truly wonderful to gaze upon, with underwater cities and dogfights that include a huge amount of imagination. Darth Maul is a more than worthy villain that has lightsaber dueling skills that are undeniably awesome. The characters add enough humor and charm to make the film more lighthearted, particularly the aliens in Naboo and Jar-Jar Binks(whom is a lovable character in my eyes). Overall, TPM is the best of the Star Wars saga and the best sci-fi movie ever made with a more adult plot than most of them, phenomenal visuals, an epic villain, and well-realized and memorable characters.",1

488,1.0,"fans say, the original trilogy are not the best films ever made. Their faults are numerous and have been the butt of many jokes in shows such as 'Family Guy'. Lucas' success was creating a fully immersive universe full of iconic characters that allow us to escape reality. So when he announced that the prequels were being made, excitement was off the scale. I remember sitting waiting for the curtain to go up for 'The Phantom Menace' when it was released in 1999 and bursting with expectation. Then I remember the crushing disappointment that followed as the horror unfolded on screen. Back to 2012. 'The Phantom Menace' is re-released in 3D. Do I A) Remember how bad it is and avoid? Or B) Part with some hard earned cash to make George a little bit richer? Those who went for 'B' give yourselves a gold star. From the start, boredom reigns supreme. The introductory scrolling text is about taxation of trade routes and a blockade by 'The Trade Federation'. Who needs Rebel Alliances or Galactic Empires when you can base a plot around trade disputes! Much of the film is bogged down in tedious political plots and manoeuvring. What action there is centres around the Jedi Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as they battle the Droid army of the Trade Federation. Unlike Storm Troopers, the Droids make terrible bad guys. Sure, Storm Troopers are pretty useless but the Droids make them look like the S.A.S. Not only do the standard Battle Droids look like Games Workshop rejects but they offer all the resistance of a wet paper bag. You never feel they're a genuine threat. Their limited dialogue is meant to be humorous but instead makes them seem completely stupid. Why would somebody design an army of robots, spend billions on constructing it only to make them as effective as 'The Three Stooges'? Darth Maul, the Dark Jedi who takes on the heroes, finally brings some credibility to proceedings but it is too little too late. He is the only colour in a mire of drab characters. Unfortunately the other stand out is Jar Jar Binks. So much bile and hatred has been written about him over the years (and rightly so), that all I'll say is 'Worst movie decision ever'. Anakin Skywalker (A.K.A. a young Darth Vader) falls into the category of 'annoying movie brat'. His infatuation with the teenage Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), which is central to the plot of the prequels, is messed up as the age gap between them is so great. Oh, and get this. Anakin Skywalker built C3 P0. To provide more of a link with the original trilogy, Lucas decides to provide us with the back stories of not only C3 P0 but R2 D2 as well. This truly jumps the shark. We also get more explanation about The Force. Jedi can harness it due to having a high count of midi-chlorians in their blood – microscopic organisms that allow them to connect with the force. The higher their midi-chlorian count; the stronger the Jedi. So instead of being a mystical field of energy that unites all living things, a metaphysical and ubiquitous power, The Force is reduced to the status of a virus. How were the Jedi wiped out? Someone prescribed them Tamiflu. Ridiculousness reaches new levels when we learn that Anakin Skywalker was 'immaculately conceived' by the midi-chlorians. By now fans are starting to get seriously hacked off. Another noteworthy happening is during the underwater journey from Gungan City to save Queen Amidala (who was apparently elected to server her people, surely a first for royalty) from the Trade Federation invasion. Qui Gon and Obi Wan's craft is caught by a giant predator, only to be saved when the attacker is snapped up by a bigger creature. Five minutes or so later, exactly the same thing happens again. I'm not kidding, it's like the film was made by a five year old; 'Again Daddy, do it again'. Dialogue is horrendous throughout, especially that given to Trade Federation characters. We know Lucas can't write dialogue worth toffee from the earlier Star Wars movies, but he hits a new low here. Even Liam Neeson can't make bring it to life, which is saying something. Acting is equally cringe worthy. The CGI characters give the same level of performance as the humans. 'The Phantom Menace' reveals George Lucas as the hack who got lucky he really is. If he'd released this instead of 'A New Hope' back in 1978 the franchise would have sunk without a trace. Of course, then we'd have to believe that he had all six movies mapped out from the beginning, which I don't. How could he have got things so wrong? Possibly because nobody at the studio says 'No' to him. All his ideas are assumed to be guaranteed money spinners and are green-lighted automatically. There's so much fiction set in the Star Wars universe; both published and fan. It would have been so easy to get a writer or two with the knowledge and love of the series to construct a decent plot. Unfortunately Lucas is given God-like control over proceedings. He might as well have urinated on the fans whilst stealing their wallets. Re-releasing 'The Phantom Menace' in 3D can only be seen as a cynical ploy to increase his personal fortune. As it wasn't filmed with 3D in mind it has been post rendered which makes the whole thing a pointless exercise. I hear by solemnly swear that I will never, ever, watch 'The Phantom Menace' again.",0

What I need to tell you won't take very long at all; I don't like ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace."" I don't expect you to like it. It has oodles of horrendous dialogue even by the low standards of the Saga, it's been a destructive force in the reputation of the otherwise underrated and masterful ""Star Wars"" prequels, it joins ""The Force Awakens"" as one of only two ""Star Wars"" movies I refuse to watch when marathoning the Saga.

491,4.0,"After 16 long years, George Lucas continued his Star Wars saga with this prequel, set roughly 30 years before the original trilogy. When I first saw this movie, I looked forward to learning about the events that led up to the original Star Wars trilogy, how the Old Republic governed itself, how Jedi were selected, trained and initiated, and how the Empire rose to power. But it turned out I learned very little from this latest installment. The characters Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn are introduced, but the characters are not developed well. I didn't feel like I got to know either of these characters. Plot elements are hinted at rather than thoroughly explained. They mention the ""trials"" that a Jedi must go through without explaining what they are, or why Master Qui-Gon is being kept out of the Jedi Council. There is a new villain in this movie, Darth Maul, who I learned even less about. In one of his few lines he mentions a desire for revenge- revenge for what, exactly? Nothing is explained in this movie. Instead we are transported from one place to another as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon fight off armies of droids with their lightsabers. Good action scenes and great digital graphics, but without good dialog the story is empty of meaning. Good points- the trip through the planet core, the pod race, introduction to the Jedi Council and the Republic Senate, and Darth Maul's two-bladed light saber. Bad points- Jar Jar Binks & the rest of the Gungans, Anakin (sorry, he was way too chipper), plot and dialog. I recommend skipping this chapter of the saga and starting off with Attack of the Clones. 4 out of 10.",0

Sure the scenery, costumes, and special effects were all top notched and they really did give the viewer the feel of the stars wars movie's, but the acting and story are amazingly bad.  I have watched the movie several times, and I still don't understand why the trade federation (a group of chinese toad people) feel the need to invade the peaceful planet of Naboo.  Well they do attack and the princess of Naboo must esacpe with two jedi.  They meet up with some uncharismatic little kid (anakin skywalker, who is like 7 in this movie, and eventually gets Natalie Portman-the princess pregnant with luke and leia, don't pay attention to the fact Natalie Portman is 18 in this movie, they are replacing the actor of anakin in stars wars episode 2 with an older kid, why not have the foresight for this in the first place)  The movie is just plain stupid.  The robots look weak and flimsy, and they stutter.  The spaceships have lost all of the charm and individuality compared to the first three movies.  The end is so anti-climatic.  This trade federation sends in a horde of robot troops to conquer the planet.  The gungans (a native race of naboo) accidentally stumble around and blow up a lot of robots, but the ultimate slap in the face is when the seven year old Anakin, stumbles upon a spaceship, accidently turns in on, unwittingly flys into space and it just so happens that all the robots on the planet (thousands upon thousands) are controlled by one master ship, and little Anakin accidently fires a missile and coincidentally blows up the master ship.  I am actually angry at how bad this movie was because it has jaded such a great set of movies, by adding this with the other great movies, they are all somehow dirtied by it.  I am done ranting, thanks.",0

Quan-gon is however a very interesting and charismatic character, little Anacin is cute and likable and Jar-Jar is hilarious. The villains are even cooler, from the devious racer Sebulba through the merciless killing machine Darth Maul to the cunning and ruthless Darth Sidious.

No, Jar Jar doesn't bother me in the slightest, my gripe boils down to the script which i found to be both lazy (phantom is just a remake of Jedi, and New Hope, exactly the same things happen in three star wars movies now), and contradictory to the original films which maintain that Yoda taught Obi wan, not Quai Gon Who? One of the most irritating parts was the science, blood tests and midi clorians (excuse the spelling) seem so out of place in star wars, explaining ""the force"", and Jedi in this way is akin to dissecting dragons and unicorns.

It's supposed to be the first Star Wars movie, it needs to set things up. We get an introduction of the main characters and goals. It is very political, but remember that this is before the Jedi fell. The Jedi were way over their heads with their power and became ignorant. They have way too much contact with politics. I just love the feel of this movie. Go watch some Disney shows or movies and then watch all the Lucas movies. The feel is always there. The magic, the excitement. Not to say that everything Disney Star Wars related is bad, but it's just very different. And come on, stop hating Jar Jar.

Yes, he was a horrible character, but he did get a chuckle out of me from time to time, even if it was just a stupid humor chuckle, and I didn't find him as annoying as other people did. And who knows, if people didn't hate on him so much, we might have gotten that rumored intended twist that revealed that his stupidity was an act and he was actually Darth Plagueis secretly manipulating everything and everyone the whole time.",0

All the characters chosen couldn't be chosen better. It made sense to the rest of the movies. Jar Jar was an amazing character i cant believe so many people dislike this character. The scenes were beautiful the story line was amazing. People should appreciate the Prequels more and appreciate George Lucas for these amazing movies. People said it was all cgi special effects but it was all real places real scenery they really need to get informed better. People who hate on it just didn't want to see something new about Star wars all they wanted was something like the old parts. For me number 1 2 and 3 were way better than 4 5 and 6.,1

Jar Jar was the kid friendly part of the movie, kids found him cute, adults find him annoying and being an adult, I found him very annoying and was hoping for a death scene, never got my wish.

514,8.0,"Possibly the most over-hated movie of all time. This film was hated on specifically for two reasons. 1. The film was unbelievably hyped up to the point that no movie could live up to the demand that was being put out. 2. The film delivered a massively different take on the universe that what fans had grown used to. While the originals delivered a gritty, post-apocalyptic type war feel, The Phantom Menace gave a sleek, clean, and cool vibe that clashed with preconceived notions about the film. Despite the hate this film is solid. Nothing special pops out to the audience, but the story is innovative, the action is fun, and the new take on the universe is quite cool when taken at face value. However, the movie is also quite sloppy. The film is very unbalanced in the time it dedicates to explaining certain details, and the acting is very weak at time (dialogue included). Despite its flaws though this is still an enjoyable solid entry into the Star Wars lore/cannon. (Also the BEST lightsaber duel in the whole cannon).",1

What's with the goofy dialect for Jar Jar and why does this doofus get so much screen time? Lucas fails miserably not only with his embarrassing script, but also with his inept direction. He is a special effects wizard and seems to be clueless about storytelling and acting. Why does he have Portman deliver her lines like a robot? A major disappointment.",0

518,2.0,"I remember seeing this film in theatres the day it came out. I am a huge Star Wars fan, not some weirdo who dresses up in SW costumes, but someone who truly holds a special place in their heart for the original three films. After seeing this movie back when it was released, I remember being utterly disappointed by it. I also couldn't think of another film that was single-handly ruined by one single character like this movie is. Yes, Jar Jar Binks has to be the worst character, not only in the Star Wars universe, but in any film ever! Trust me, he's that bad. He ruins the movie completely. And he's not even a minor character, he has more screen time than Obi-Wan and Darth Maul! Give me a break Lucas. This is really a kids movie, very childish in so many ways. I just bought the DVD's of the all three prequels the other day. They were on sale. I watched Phantom Menace last night and my thoughts are still the same. Every time a scene would become interesting it was quickly ruined by horrible dialogue or acting, or Jar Jar would walk in. Perhaps the most intense scene of the movie, the Darth Maul/Jedi fight, if absolutely ruined by cutting the scene back to Jar Jar stumbling around. This movie was the biggest letdown. Yes, I was expecting a lot, but this is a really bad movie on its own, not connected to the other three films. The SFX were the only thing worth noting with this horror show. George Lucas should be ashamed of himself. This movie has a terrible plot, horrible acting, even worse dialogue, and almost NO character development. Don't waste your time.",0
519,7.0,I think the hate behind this film is fueled by the fact that people expected Star Wars to be perfect. And it wasn't. Especially considering that George Lucas was back at the helm as director. Only a few flaws keep it from being great.,1
520,3.0,"The Phantom Menace is watchable - the visuals keep me interested but that's almost everything good about this one, which is by far the worst of the second trilogy: a kid a hero, immaculate conception of the new messiah (turning to darkness later), that mysterious appearance and disappearance of ""Midi-chlorian"", whatever it is. Than we got that Jar Jar Binks - maybe the most annoying character of the whole Star Wars universe... What else? Taking the kid away from the mother because, you know, our heroes have nothing worth enough to buy the mother's freedom too (well, we got a queen but no jewels at all, because you know, the plot demands it to keep mother in slavery for a later to be discovered purpose). Really, those parts (and some more) were and are still cringe-worthy. Another example? War droids with a sense for humor and fear - who is responsible for that kind of programming, one might be tempted to ask. I could go on and on, and I got to ask myself, what kind of substances did Mr. Lucas use writing this mess. No doubt, all those generic movies of the third trilogy are tempting to cloud one's judgement regarding episode I, but nonetheless, this movie is really a steep and impressive downfall from the quality of the first three epics. But maybe the only (or main) aim of this movie was to boost up the sells of Star Wars merchandise - from this point of view, The Phantome Menace makes perfectly sense.",0
521,8.0,"The Star Wars trilogy is such a holy of holies among film fans that George Lucas must have had nerves of steel to go ahead with his long-held plans for the prequel trilogy. The news that a new chapter was on the way was ridiculously exciting, even to an on-again/off-again casual non-fan like me, but the immense build-up that came before it was followed by a crushing disappointment as I sat through two hours of nothing-much and a gibberish-spouting lizard-fish pratting around like Sylvester McCoy. I saw it again a week later in the hope anticipation had crippled its chances, and second time around it challenged Return of the Jedi for third place in the franchise.",0
522,10.0,"I've seen this movie for almost 10 times, and I still love it. Of course, it's not as good as its predecessors. The FX were dazzling, the acting was pretty good and the score (John Williams) was really, really beautiful. The Naboo Starfighters were much more streamlined than the X-Wings, Y-Wings... I learned that Jar Jar was not so popular, but I must admit that that he was very funny. The most famous scene of this movie must be the podracing. The podracing was exciting AND funny, with the struggle between Sebulba and Anakin. Anakin made me actually think of Haley Joel Osment. In short, I think it was a great movie and I can only give it 5/5.",1

525,1.0,This movie was made only for the money it was going to make... you can tell. It was long and really boring. Like with the pod scene it was so long and you knew he was going to win.  And that kid they picked to play young Vader was so bad.  Avoid this movie! Only true Star Wars fans will like it because they can't see that this is a horrible movie! Ay bendito! It was also long and boring.  SO bad that you will not want to see the next one.,0
526,1.0,"Being a 27-year-old whose first impressions of great, exciting filmmaking were largely shaped by the first trilogy, I can honestly (and sadly) say ""The Phantom Menace"" does not fit among them.  I could spend hours dissecting the individually poor decisions made in the scripting and directing of this film (from the very first confusing, hastily edited ""trade negotiation"" scene all the way to the accidental heroism of Anakin and Jar Jar), but the only thing that seems to matter now is that I never felt that I was involved in the action or emotionally invested in any of the characters.  And isn't that why we go to see movies -- to be gripped by a story about people we can identify with?",0
527,8.0,"OK, this is set before the first Star Wars movie came out. It starts out with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (one of my favorite Jedi's.

528,9.0,"This film gets a lot of hate, but it has a good story, great characters, a good climax and a great soundtrack. It is a underrated movie and is a good start to the Skywalker Saga. It introduces the characters very well, Liam Neeson is great as is Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Iain McDiarmid. Jake Lloyd is also great as little Anakin Skywalker and didn't deserve the ridiculous amount of hate he received. The movie also has arguably the best lightsaber fight in Star Wars and was light years ahead of its time when it was released in 1999.",1

With a film that came 22 years after his last directed movie, one can't expect to find a flawless movie but I suppose people couldn't imagine it would be this different from what we saw in the Star Wars Original Trilogy. Anyway, it's time to unravel just why this is a bad Star Wars film, but not necessarily a bad movie. Yeah, this isn't THAT BAD of a film, even with all the screw-ups and failures within.

American Graffiti, Star Wars Trilogy, even Howard the Duck made money at the box office. Then, Episode I comes out and everybody hates it. Even your die hard sci fi nuts had to watch it three times to find out that the film didn't do anything for them. It's true, that anything compared to the original is hard to beat. In the end, Lucas made his millions off the movie. Then again, his strong fan base will never be the same. Lets pray to GOD...or George Lucas.....that Episode II will make up for Episode I",0

540,9.0,"This is one of my favorite entries in the series, therefore I think it is highly underrated. George Lucas had not directed a film in 20 years when he tackled this and he does an awesome job. The scenes on Tatooine are beautiful. The acting is great, especially Liam Neeson. When his character dies at the end you feel the sense of loss, it's as you have lost your own personal Jedi master. Ewan McGregor is very good just as well. The fighting scenes against the Evil Sith-man are great. This movie was very satisfying in the end and left me in anticipation of the next one. So what's all the fuss about?",1

543,5.0,"In the middle of 1999, I went with family, and friends of family, to see a film that fans of George Lucas' original series had been waiting for over a period of sixteen years. The level of anticipation that had built up over that time was such that no film could live up to expectations, but the film was enjoyed as a singular experience anyway. The main reason for this is the difference an audience can make. One advantage of a midnight screening at a George Lucas film, at least in this market, is the absence of small children, idiots, and other problems likely to disrupt enjoyment. Nobody goes to this much trouble to see a film unless they want to be hit in the face with every piece of dialogue or every sound. While disappointment can be blamed to some extent upon false expectations built up over a period of years, the film also displays many symptoms of Lucas taking his audience for granted. It is hardly helpful when a director surrounds himself with yes-men that confirm the validity of every decision he makes, regardless of its presence.",0

It was later on, that people really started getting upset and likened it to one of the worst movies ever produced.<br /><br />I must say, on my part, that although over time, and after repeated viewing the movie, didn't fulfill my expectations entirely, I've never been able to write it off as the massive failure that everyone seems to think it is. It's not quite at the same level as the Original trilogy, but from a technical standpoint was quite groundbreaking at the time and I remember been thoroughly enthralled by the whole experience, down mainly to this being the first ever Star Wars movie that I saw on the big screen. For that and mostly a nostalgic factor, I'm prone to forgive most of its shortcomings. Granted, it's got silly dialogue, most of the characters are one-dimensional or outright silly ( the Gungans come to mine), but it's got some truly amazing action set pieces (the pod race sequence, the final battle, the lightsabre duel between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon versus Darth Maul.. to name just a few and a, once again, amazing soundtrack by master John Williams. Faulty, but not a complete write off. Watch it with an open mind.",1
545,5.0,"I thought that the special effects for this movie were beyond anything I have ever seen.  The rendering of the various vehicles and creatures was fantastic.

The CGI effects were incredible, and the action sequences have to be seen to be believed.  The acting was typical of a Star Wars film (think Mark Hamill in the others), but who gives a ****, right?  And yes, I even liked Jar Jar Binks; I figure, if this trilogy is going to be dark, we're gonna need some comic relief, however childish. In summary, THIS IS STAR WARS; there is no denying that fact, but it is also something different - so treat it as such.  Also watch for E.T. in the galactic senate.  I can't wait for Episode 2!!!",1

The pod race was probably my least favourite extended sequence of the film. Jar Jar didn't jar jar on me (sorry, I had to...) nearly as much as I thought that he would. In fact, I found his accent, another racial caricature there, considerably more annoying than his antics and I actually laughed at him in the manner which George Lucas intended several times.",0

Usual explanation is that the storyline and characters were by far more interesting. Well, I don't agree. Although I also have very fond memories of the original Star Wars-movie (and it's sequels) since it was my very first non-cartoonish feature I saw in theater (twice) at age 10, I already back then realized that these movies aren't by any significant margin above cartoon-level anyhow. Awesome, epoch making, brilliantly entertaining scifi with great special effects surely. So throughout the 1990's after I first heard that George Lucas was planning those brand new episodes, becoming possible by revolutionary CGI-technology, I knew there was something spectacular on its way. And I wasn't disappointed. To my money, now having seen them all, Episode I - The Phantom Menace is The Best of the whole series: Special FX leave nothing to desire, just as one assumed; action-scenes and overall pace are beautifully orchestrated; Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are among my very favorite actors and their line delivery is always ear-pleasing, no matter what they say; and it all climaxes in the greatest sword-fight ever, laser or not, in movie history. Granted, there are long speeches and meetings couple too many, the podrace-scene is a tad too long also, and obligatory funny ""black"" character Jar Jar Binks is VERY unfunny, but those are minor flaws. Especially compared to myriad of shortcomings found in former episodes, particularly in Return Of The Jedi, the only actual black sheep of the whole saga.

Many people (wrongly) thought that it was part of a prequel trilogy to the Star Wars movies, in which George Lucas had (allegedly) been involved in making many years ago, but anyone expecting a film like that would only be disappointed. The film isn't as serious as Spaceballs and it's also worth noting that the effects aren't as impressive, particularly the cartoon-style CGI, but this isn't a problem due to the comedic nature of the film; decent special effects would only have detracted from the gags and OTT acting.

However, after watching it at an older age, I appreciated the film more. Of course the Gungans are annoying, the CGI dated, and some of the dialogue is messy, the film sets up Anakin and his relationship with Obi-Wan and Padme, as well as fleshing out Obi-Wan's past.

585,5.0,"After seeing the first prequel of Lucas' new installment of Star Wars films, I am apprehensive about the next two. Lucas does not have the same humor and charm the first films had. A new cast of characters and actors make it even more distant. The visuals are great, much improved from 20 years ago, but Lucas does not have the same glorious elements of his first trilogy. Those elements include comic relief, inspired characters, and a frightening antagonist. The protagonists here are not as good as the first films. His characters are lacking and the charm just really does not work in the same spellbinding way as the first trilogy.",1
586,1.0,The most stupid expensive movie in film history. Jar Jar is a shameful creation and spoils the rest of the movie which is pretty bad anyway.,0
587,1.0,"This could be the worst movie ever made.  Lucas screwed up bigtime.  (1) there was no story and (2) the acting was horrible.  Face it, I was lost before the movie even got under way!  During the whole ""Episode I: blah blah blah"" introduction, Lucas used big words and didn't make a whole lot of sense.  There was no bad guy in the movie (oh yeah, there was a total of 5 minutes and 15 seconds of shots / references to Darth Maul).",0
588,10.0,"People who hate Jar Jar and Ewoks gotta stop taking the Star Wars so seriously. They simply embody the element of comedy that has always been present in the films. I personally was never bothered by Jar Jar's presence in this film, since he is clearly a better actor than Natalie Portman.",1
589,1.0,George Lucas really started losing his touch as an artist in Return of the Jedi.  It seems he puts more and more emphasis on the business side of movie making.  I can't wait till the next Star Wars toys start coming out a year in advance.,1
590,8.0,"My first viewing of TPM was, to put it mildly, sheer sensory overload. The second viewing, things flowed much better and I sat  back to enjoy it for what it was. Loved getting a taste of what Jedi could do at the height of their abilities, and the conflict with the Sith. Liked the conflict with the Naboo/Trade Federation.  Tolerated the Gungans. ;) The podrace was technically impressive, but wears a bit thin on repeated viewings. My favorite part of it ended up being Qui-Gon and Padme' discussing Jedi recklessness, go figure. IF you haven't seen it yet: Ignore the critics. Ignore the hype. Don't go expecting SW, ESB or ROTJ. Judge it on its own merits and be ready to see it at least twice, once to take it all in and another (at least) to enjoy it.",1
591,6.0,"I just rewatched this movie as part of a Star Wars marathon and honestly, it isn't that bad. There's a lot to hate and get frustrated by with this movie but there's a lot that's underappreciated and left me wowed. Let's start with the flaws first.",0
592,7.0,"Although the Phantom Menace was not as good as the original trilogy, it was not a bad movie, and I feel that the hatred for the movie, and especially Jar Jar Binks, is uncalled for. There were some very good aspects of the Phantom Menace, for example; firstly, the special effects in the movie were extremely good for the time that it was made, Secondly, there was a very amusing pod race on tatooine, thirdly, the characters, except for Jar Jar Binks, are well written on the whole, and finally, It offers the start of a very interesting back story into Darth Vader's past. But, on the other hand, there are some bad points, such as; the length of the film, I felt, and so did many others, that the political plot to the movie was too dragged out, and became tiresome. And even worse, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in any film I have seen. So, on the whole, the film would have been a lot better without Jar Jar Binks",0
593,8.0,"Personally I don't completely get the hate this movie gets. Yes it's not that good as the Empire Strikes Back or the New Hope, but it adds a lot to the Star Wars universe. The effects are phenomenal considering it was made in the 90-s, the soundtrack is legendary, and it builds up the story to the other movies.",1
594,8.0,My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. ,0
595,8.0,I am a fan of the originals and I went to see it opening night like everyone else did twenty two years earlier. It was enjoyable to see it continuing for the younger generation and I kept an open mind. I was not disappointed. Lucas did a good job although the Jar-Jar Binks character should not have had as big a part and legions of fans still hate him. Another flaw was that Darth Maul didn't have a big enough part. He could have really been something had his character been given more lines and screen time. Not as big as Vader but still big. Other than those two things I would say it was commendable for not having any of the original cast with the exception of McDermid who is a big plus in my book. A solid actor if there ever was one and a nice guy so I hear.,1
596,1.0,"When I heard Lucas was going to make THREE MORE STAR WARS MOVIES I was really excited.  Then as I started thinking about it I realized that the true and original trilogy was just about perfect.  Would these new films mess all of that up?  My sister said, don't worry it's George Lucas.  I thought about that and was then fully reassured that the new films would be great. When I did go to the movie I was shocked.  It (to me) didn't have any star wars feel to it.  I was at one time a star wars freak.  I think most people go through that stage and then are fans for life.  Some however, are diehard fans. They will stick by Lucas's side through it all.  I am just a fan and was very disappointed in STAR WARS, Episode one.  The acting was terrible, the special effects were way overdone and Lucas lost my faith.  Now those fans who liked phantom menace may be saying that I am no true fan saying this about a star wars movie.  Well, Maybe it's this star wars movie that's saying i am not a real fan. Sorry George. --Adios",0
597,7.0,"This show is wonderful for small children, the audience it seemed to be directed toward. The acting in certain parts (On the part of Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman in particular) was lacking and shadowed the rest of the movie. Jar Jar was unbearable but enjoyable to small children though, if you were an adult you would rather have clawed your own eyes out then watch a scene with him. Liam Neeson, Ray Park, Ian McDiarmid, Pernilla August were splendid! Ray Park certainly deserved a higher billing then the one he received for he had such presence in all his scenes, and seemed totally engrossed in his role unlike Ewan McGregor who grated on the nerves as a whiny lap dog nipping at Liam Neeson's heels. Lloyd seems to have promise as an actor, though I feel his performance was a bit exaggerated, as if he was trying too hard to be a little boy. The pod-racing scene lasted too long and I found myself wishing I could fast forward to the exciting, suspenseful fight scenes toward the end (Though I admit I was rooting for Maul). Natalie Portman's acting in this movie was poor, especially as Padme Neberrie with extremely odd dialogue between herself and Anakin. She was stiff as the fourteen-year-old Queen and completely detached from her part. Whether that was intentional on the part of Lucas I do not know but I hope she is more bearable next time though it doesn't appear that this talented actress has suffered any from her poor performance in this film. This film seemed more directed toward children then adults, if I was five or six I believe I would have liked it more myself.",0
598,6.0,"I dont really know what to say about this movie its like a rollercoster, Some really really cringe and bad moments in this movie but there is also some good moments.<br /><br />Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman is just a little too cringe sometimes when they are togheter does it feel like a very bad disney kids tv series.<br /><br />And why does Ewan Mcgregor have too comentate every thing he does, it gets Much Better in the third but in this its too much.<br /><br />Overall i like the story of it self, it feels like you are seeing a Star Wars movie, its not boring like attack of the clones in my opinon. A lot of big Starwars fans hate Jar Jar Binks, i dont but that just my opinion. I think Star Wars The Phantom Menace is a overall good movie and a decent Star Wars movie.",0
599,4.0,"This was a massively disappointing movie at release, and it's not really aged well since then. An over reliance on PlayStation 2 era special effects, yet they skimped on extras (why is Naboo almost completely unpopulated?). Far too much boring discussions about trade negotiations. Far too much looking at people sitting and talking, standing and talking, walking and talking. There are a couple of good action sequences though, and the A-list actors do their best with the atrocious dialogue. Notice I'm not complaining about Jar Jar Binks? Well, he's far from the worst thing about this movie. Let's hope the entire prequel trilogy is remade someday, after hiring decent writers.",0
600,10.0,I love this film. ,1
601,10.0,"I cannot tell you how many times I've watched this movie, i would restart it as soon as it finishes. This movie is the definition of Star Wars. The planets, the scrip, characters & aliens are so unique. The story is amazing but for many hard to understand. Almost everything from this movie is iconic. The scenery and aesthetic of it is one of the best from all the episodes. A great start to the saga !",1

604,1.0,"As a big Starwars fan i can't help feel disappointed with this installment of the StarWars prequel., It lacks emotion character development and serious acting. Too comical for a Starwars film even if it was intended for kids. Apart from this and Jar Jar, and whats the deal with Boss Nass and his slobbering. Although Visual were stunning. The Saber duels at times were filmed to close. Altogether one Big Opppps!!",0

606,1.0,"Just watched it for 2nd time after 22 years, and it was a struggle to finish it. The story is for a cartoon at best, and the lines are just pathetic. Acting is really bad but they were probably trapped in the poorly written scripts. The use of British accents for good guys and minority accents for annoying or evil guys is amazingly racist.",0
607,8.0,The visuals are stunning and were groundbreaking back in 99.<br /><br />Too much politics for some people but I found it realistic and engaging.<br /><br />It has its problems but the good stuff outweighs the bad stuff.<br /><br />All the Maul scenes are great. Mcgregor is great choice as Kenobi and then dual at then end is flat out stunning - even now it holds up and is better than anything in the new Disney flicks!,1
608,10.0,"Yet another case of hatred towards the sequel of the most popular films in history. Nothing to be done. This film is good. The hatred towards the special effects is so high that you cover the eyes. I really enjoyed goes quite well. Good story, good actors, special effects excellent, and really not bad characters. The battles are more spectacular but compared to previous alleged hatred of intellectuals and film is too high. I reason with my head is really a good movie. I would like to know why there attack so much to the special effects since they are the backbone of a film.",1
609,6.0,"As a film, it was good, but as a Star Wars film, it was disappointing.",0
610,8.0,"I really think most of the so called ""fans"" of Star Wars, missed the point of the entire Prequel Trilogy. First and foremost Episode One, was meant to be a set up film. Not only for the next two movies, but for the whole saga. George Lucas wanted to tell the back story. The rise of the Empire and the Sith, and the fall of the Old Republic. The main point was to know ""Who was Darth Vader"". First off to know Who Vader was we have to start at the beginning. When he was a boy, as set up in this Movie, we get a basic sense who the boy who would grow up to become Vader, really is. Now First Aestheticlly, the movie is phenomenal. The settings and visuals really are Gorgeous. The Special Effects, for a 1999 film, still hold up Today in 2010. They were Groundbreaking and Nothing like this was ever done before. I mean let's be real. Without Lucasfilm's ILM there would be No real Special Effects. Next, The story- Obviouslly the First installment was based towards a younger generation. Jar- Jar, at first I couldn't stand him. I thought he was horrible. Now I look back at the movies again and, yes there are some things that were too slapstick. However Overall he really wasen't That bad a character. He was clumsy and awkward. However in a strange way, He more or less worked. Now the story which was set 10 years before Episode II, the main plot didn't focus on the story as a whole. Yes people will always complain, but every installment of the Star Wars movies, had it's importance. In episode I,it was to show Anakin's Start, how he was a nice kid. His start as a padawan. Now some people say this Midiclorian stuff was wrong. I kind of agree, something that made the force special, was not knowing really what it was or the true mysteries behind it. Kind of like the impossibility of Understanding what God really is. Did the midi's ruin anything for me? No, it was really a small part of the movie. Kind of like in A New Hope, When people were wearing shirts ""Han shot first"" O.K. let's be real, does it really matter in the story as a whole, NO! Get a life people, Kiss a Girl. Anyway back to Episode I, the main point was the force is strong in the Skywalker blood line. So to assume that Anakin Destroyed the Droid control ship was random. As Qui-Gon says ""Nothing that happens is accidental"" The force is behind it all. Next, In order to tell a movie that would please everyone, well that is impossible. Was this the best Movie? NO, it was still a very good beginning to the Star Wars saga. As they say all sagas have a beginning.",1
611,8.0,"I have watched all ""Star Wars"" movies many times and I can consider myself a fan of the series. The hate this movie attracts is beyond me. It has 6.6 here and nonsense like ""Interstellar"" get 8.9? Now that's just wrong. ""The Phantom Menace"" is not a perfect film, but there was no way George Lucas could please all people by going all the way back and re-inventing the whole story. Out of 6 films made up to this date, I rate this one the 3rd best. Why? Because it simply feels that way after watching all of them so many times. It is a very good start to the story, centered around a young boy who is given great talent and an opportunity to make his mark in the galaxy. This is essentially what the whole series is about - rise, fall and redemption of its main character. And his rise must begin through a child prodigy subplot. The pod racing part remains for me one of the most powerful in the whole series. The whole film is a bit cheeky and childish, but which episode of it isn't? These isn't serious drama making and it never was. It's a space opera with good guys fighting the bad guys, with shiny space background, wonderful worlds and delicate music. I do admit episodes 2 and 3 had certain problems in storytelling, but this first trilogy nicely connects with the original one and they both together make a wonderful epic.",1
612,1.0,"Lucas is getting old. And so is his imagination. The Phantom Menace is not a terrible movie. It isn't even a bad one. The problem is: it's a Star Wars movie. Which means it has to stand next to classics like the original Star Wars (10/10, my score), The Empire Strikes Back (10/10), and The Return of the Jedi (8/10). And there's where it fails.",0
613,,"Let me introduce myself. I am a huge Star Wars fan from time before prequels. By the time this movie was released I had seen the original trilogy many times and fell in love with them.

I remember having goose bumps at the title screen as I had when I saw ""Star Wars"" special edition in 1997 in theaters.",1

615,9.0,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace reviewed by Sam Osborn ,0
616,5.0,"In terms of filmmaking, I think we can all agree that the prequels, for the most part, don't stand up to the standard of the original trilogy even a little bit. The prequel trilogy begins here with a lacklustre introduction at best. With clunky, cringeworthy dialogue, bland performances and many strange casting choices, Episode I has a special place in my heart only for nostalgia. But on a technical level, this one simply didn't cut it. Average at best, but I feel like I'm being generous in saying that, if this didn't have the Star Wars logo on the cover, I would probably be saying much worse, but the love and nostalgia I feel for this franchise holds me back from doing so. All in all, I have never felt that the prequels 'ruined' the franchise in any way. For the most part I actually think the story on its own (acting and execution aside) is very good and one that deserves a lot more credit.",1
617,8.0,"I don't know why these movies, episodes 1-3 get so much hate. I understand it had problems. Some cheesy lines, sure... some parts with questionable acting.. Ok... these problems are nothing new to Star Wars... The original acting wouldn't have won any drama awards... but thats part of the charm of star wars.. The biggest problem with this movie was that George went ham on the CGI effects... and JAJA Binks was a little too much. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> With that aside, there were a lot of GREAT things about these movies people seem to over look. I think in time these movies will get more respect gradually.. There were a lot of memorable scenes, innovative ideas and great acting.. Liam Neeson, McGreggor, the Emperor... all did a fantastic job. Some of the battle scenes and music were epic.. Even when the movie felt childish... they still knew how to create evil characters and dark scenes.. Darth Maul was way darker and cooler than the space balls character from force awakens. There were a lot of memorable things about all three of these movies.. They still had the magic touch of the original and were enjoyable to watch. I liked all three of these prequels more than I did watching the Force Awakens..",1

620,6.0,"This movie almost destroyed Star Wars for me. It just isn't very good. Whether it's the poor writing, or the overused CGI, this film just doesn't work for me. And don't even get me started on the fact that George Lucas decided to start off this trilogy with little Anakin Skywalker, making his relationship with Padmé all the more weirder. And what makes this movie even worse is that it followed the amazing original trilogy, so that doesn't make it better. The reason I didn't quit Star Wars after this movie is Qui-Gon Jinn, the lightsaber duel near the end, and John Williams' extraordinary score.",0

622,7.0,"Star Wars the Phatom Manace is a whole different approach to the Franchise. Unlike its predecessors, it focuses more on the political and bureaucratic spectrum, perhaps in excess, as the pacing is significantly affected making the story difficult and sometimes boring to follow.

625,9.0,"I know I'm not the first person to say this, but I honestly think the prequels are beyond underrated; they are underestimated, and underappreciated. This first one was...really captivating. Fascinating narration of the young slave boy and his mother. With all his kindness, it is hard to believe the little fella will go on to commit such acts of pure evil. The nuance is there, along with the drama, the action and the awesome adventure. The most awesome of all is of course, Darth Maul. He's my absolute favourite; pun intended.",1
626,7.0,"When TPM first came out, people were none too impressed, because it had problems, which even Return of the Jedi didn't.  The latter started looking better.  Well, now the same thing has happened.  With the advent of AOTC, I, for one, am looking much more fondly on this much maligned Episode 1. Granted, qualitywise it's not much better a movie then AOTC.  But it's a lot more entertaining.  Probably because Jar Jar isn't nearly as annoying as Hayden Christensen(Sure Jake Lloyd wasn't much good either, but he didn't get as much opportunity to make people cringe as Hayden did, because of the way the part was written).  In fact, one gets the impression that Lucas hadn't entirely gone to seed quite yet when he did this one.  Sure, there are groans, but after watching AOTC, there don't seem so many of them as there once did. Which leaves the question of what will happen to AOTC after Episode III comes out.",0

631,1.0,"Twenty-two years after `Star Wars', George Lucas almost remade it with `The Phantom Menace': an invasion, a royal female in distress, two rescuing heroes, training of a young recruit, funny puppets, war scenes and a final prize-winning ceremony, with the added attraction of a sequence where Lucas' fascination with car races is evident. A too schematic and fragmented belligerent fable, a science-fiction tale with its feet sunk in the prosaic troubles of post-capitalism, this pre-sequel of the saga had the advantage of counting with two generations of fanatics, with trade-mark atmosphere, situations and characters, with a consolidated popular tradition, and the always efficient special effects machinery.

We went there as a family one Sunday, and I noticed on the bucket that there was a really neat-looking picture of guys fighting with what I now know to be light sabers. I asked my cousin ""What is this?"" He looked at me and said ""Star Wars. The new movie."" I was introduced to Episode II through a bag of Doritos years later, and Episode III while wasting time in my grade 7 computer class. And Star Wars was completely forbidden by the parents for the little kids. Like Titanic, if you got to see it, you got bragging rights. (My cousin got supreme bragging rights when he bought the movie on VHS.) What can I say? We were young. The point of my story is simple. I was introduced to Star Wars through The Phantom Menace, and watching it was a huge thing for me, bigger than watching A New Hope.",1

This movie is better than all the new ones in many ways, but mostly because it is focused on the Jedi training and the force. Qui-Gon is a teacher, master and guru through out the whole movie, plus it has a great cast, and everything else is done great. The most underrated StarWars movie.",1

636,8.0,"This film is probably the most anticipated one in a long time, because its production was inevitable ever since the original trilogy became so popular. Some people have been waiting for its release ever since Lucas announced the trilogy of prequels was underway.  Unfortunately, this much time of anticipation means many people may have gotten their hopes raised a little too high.  Don't get me wrong--this film definitely works as far as the ""Star Wars"" movies go, but just not quite as well as the earlier films did. I hesitate to say this is the ""worst"" film of them, because I did like it, and I liked all the others.  It's just that each of the other three were better, though not by too much.  Not having ever had to wait for the release of one of the original films, I don't know how different they would have seemed to me if I did.  But this film did have its share of flaws.",1
637,8.0,"Now while many believe that The Phantom Menace did not live up to the hype, I believe it did. This review will give my reasons of why I think it is very underrated and some of the problems it had. The story begins as you would expect it, in the middle of a story. We are of course given a catch up of the story, but sadly I believe they should of went with a different route. I believe that we should not have started in the middle of a Treaty over the Blockade of a planet. I believe that it is almost as if we got sequel to something that we never seen. This is the problem I have with this film, other than that, I am completely engaged in the story and the development of Obi Wan's character is perfect: going from apprentice of Qui Gon to master of Anakin . Some times I think that Qui Gon and Obi Wans character should of been combined into one character aka Obi Wan Kenobi, as it would make more sense, continuity wise. Now to the more positive aspects of The Phantom Menace. First of all Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn is just tremendous and I mean it, it is as if he was typecast. Jake LLoyd as Anakin Skywalker may not be the best but he just pulls it off, plus he was like 8 years of age, who can blame him. Ewan Mcgregor as Obi Wan, is mostly just there to have Obi Wan be in it, but I still think he brings a great incarnation of the character. Overall I think Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is underrated classic and very re-watchable. I also think that it worked better on paper for most people and that for others it was just simply Jar Jar - do not need a explanation for that. Thank you for reading.",1

As the actual release approached people began queuing for tickets weeks in advance, and bidding up the admission cost to hundreds of dollars per seat.

646,,"""The Phantom Menace"" (a truly awful title) is supposedly the beginning of the Star Wars universe.  No offense to all you lovers of it out there, but it royally bombs in my mind.  The commericalist attitude from ""Return of the Jedi"" returns, from KFC and Pepsi to any other junk you can think of. Talk about an advertising overload. The production design in this is terrible.  Rather than the supposed functionability of the original series, everything looks like a computer-generated forgery and even the costumes are outlandishly stupid. My moral, give Lucas a 10 million dollar budget again and see what he can come up with instead of an epillepsy-inducing lightshow.",0

It may replace ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as the weakest in the story-line, but then it may have resorted to too many computer graphically created scenes, and Jar-Jar may be an annoying character, but then so was Alf and ET after a while. There is a lot of good things in this movie such as the dizzying pod race, the first double handed light saber, Liam Neeson's contribution to the series and Natalie Portman herself. I for one had an interesting time spotting the precursors and cameos of Jabba, jawas and what not. Ewan MacGregor makes an interesting Obi-Wan considering he will have to grow up and look like sir Alec Guiness and Portman is a sight to watch as a would-be heroine creating the standard for the Leia Organa to come.

COME ON!), and lets not mention that really annoying ugly fella (i deliberatly forgot his name) who was there SO obviously to please the little 'uns...that's why the only person i know who liked the movie is my cousin of eleven years. less box office thinking, mr. lucas, you already have enough money.(but i really fear that the other ones are not going to be better).",0

The film is a step back in time and shows some of the characters at an earlier time than the previous 3 episodes. However, it's also a step backwards in quality. The script in this one is strong, but that strength just doesn't come across on the screen. Don't get me wrong...it's still a really good film, but it just isn't ""great"" like the first 3. Perhaps our judgment is clouded by the fact that Lucas made everyone mad by making us wait so dadgum long for this film to appear. But at least the acting is marginally better than it was in Episode 1 and it is overall slightly better, but it still lags behind its older brethren. And that stupid Jar Jar is still in there.",1

656,5.0,"I remember seeing Star Wars at age five. I was addicted to Star Wars. I was wondering how The Phantom Menace was going to do. I thought that it was going to be a triumph like the other three, but I was proven wrong. It was an o.k. movie, but the story itself was weak. It filled some of the details, but not all. Also Lucas did a mistake in that movie. In The Empire Strikes Back, Obi-wan says to Luke, ""Go to the Degobay system. There you will find Yoda who TRAINED ME!"" Master Yoda was the master of Obi-wan, not Qui-gon Jinn, but I have to admit that if it wasn't from Liam Nelson for being in this film, the film would have crumpled. The effects were phenomenal, there was more humor, and a few good action sequences. That was another problem with the film, there was only two real good action sequences, which were the podrace and the battle at the end including the duel with lightsabers, which I thought was awesome, because in the other 3 films, there wasn't much into the duels, except a flip in Episode VI by Luke Skywalker to dodge a blow taht would have cut him in two halves. Another problem was how hokey and corny the film was with some of the creatures including the flying blue thing at the shop, and Sebulba, the podracer, nemesis of Anakin. The other problem with the film was that the dark jedi, Maul was not much of a character. To me, he was an object. You could not hate him or like him, and he didn't talk except five lines, and what was with the horns on his head? He looked like the devil! However, I do love the music of the great duel at the end, which increased the suspense in your body. I give this film a 7 out of 10. Lucas could do better than this. He needs to use more interesting ideas.",0

The main plot device is incredibly dull (trade disputes...), the pacing is off (boring but still rushed) and the most annoying character in all of Star Wars is introduced (Jar Jar Binks). The CGI is awkward, the audio editing has sloppy moments and I found myself uninterested for the majority of the film.",0

I had walkers, TIE figthers, X-wings, blasters, ETC,. When this movie went out, it made my imagination fly again, I loved and laughed at Jar JaR (even tho I found him annoying after my adult mind set it), so, its a 10/10 movie for my 12 year old mind, I think if I saw it for the first time right now i might hate it, but it brings so many memories and good feelings that I have watched it, at least once every year since 1999, 10+ times,,",1

660,10.0,"First off, let me put this up front right away. I am a MAJOR Star Wars fan. I read everything expanded universe (stuff outside the movies such as books, comics, etc.) and could write you humongous essays on Star Wars lore. One thing that people who are uneducated on Star Wars lore fell to realize is that THIS. IS. NOT. A. REMAKE. IT'S CALLED EPISODE ONE FOR A REASON. IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE TALE OF STAR WARS. THAT'S WHY DARTH VADER IS A LITTLE BOY CALLED ANAKIN. HE'S NOT DARTH YET. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE TWO MORE FILMS FEATURING ANAKIN GROWING UP AND BECOMING DARTH VADER! Now that I've yelled that, I'm going to quote Carlos Mencia. All the people who say that it's not as good as the original, that's because you were kids when the original came out. NOTHING will be as good as it was then. So just shut UP! Yes, the film was targeted at children. Now, to address Jar Jar. I liked him. He showed an advancment in CG. This is what George Lucas does. He is a brilliant film-maker (excluding Howard the Duck) and his forte is film-making advancement. He practically LIVES to advance technology. If not for Jar-Jar, people might not have a lot of advancements in cinematography that they take for granted. Now for my actual review...the film starts off at the beginning of Anakins Skywalker's tale...A.K.A. Darth Vader. But he's not Darth Vader yet. He is a small boy, approximately nine years of age, who starts off on his journey to being a Jedi in this film. Episodes II and III continue this epic, finishing with Anakin finally becoming Vader, which opens up for Episodes IV, V, and VI. Most people will hate this rant I have went on, but oh well. I personally applaud Mr. Lucas for making this film. He has a voice, and he had a dream, and he had a story, and he was going to tell it one way or the other.",0

This would have disappointed many fans, especially when they have been waiting for over 16 years and after all the publicist and advertisement they have seen.

Darth Maul and Sideous are also great villains. Dig that double-sided lightsaber! This movie does exactly what it sets out to do. Begin the story which is a direct contrast to what the story ends up to be. Thats where all the drama and conflict lies. Jar Jar isn't that bad either.

He has one or two redeeming milliseconds during the ground battles on Naboo with the droids of the Federation, but it's too little too late.

681,4.0,"After a 16 year lull, George Lucas steps back into the director's chair to provide us with the long-awaited Chapter I of the Star Wars saga. Perhaps no film could have met the expectations of delirious fans long-starved for another trip to a galaxy far, far away, but it would have been nice if Lucas had tried. Going back to view the original Star Wars, one must still be impressed that its simple good vs. evil storyline structure holds up and is enhanced by the incredibly personal flourishes – from the sets, the visuals, the rich intergalactic canvas that Lucas weaved showing an amazing array of alien beings, the background that Lucas allows each character/species, the wry sense of humor, the nice balancing of game newcomers with old pros. Unfortunately, in the interim, Lucas appears to have mistaken simplistic for simple. The Phantom Menace comes off as a Spongebob Squarepants rendition of a Star Wars film in both intellect and imagination as it pitches itself to easily impressionable 2-year-olds in the room. The storyline somehow manages to be needlessly cluttered, not well thought out and almost laughably pointless all at the same time. It comes across as something still in the development stage and given that it took Lucas 16 years to cough this up – it seems even more tragic. Opening with some incomprehensible drivel about trade agreements – the viewer is never clear on how important any of this is. The opening dialog would not have made the cut on an old Space 1999 episode and the editing is woefully inept. Watching actors like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, both far better elsewhere, interact with tacky looking CGI effects and pretend that they are at risk from a gaggle of obscenely incompetent aliens and robots, all of whom speak pidgin English and are about as menacing as the buffoons from a Marx Brothers comedy is a real low point. Much ink has been spilled lambasting the inclusion of an alien – Jar Jar Binks – whose ineptitude and Amos & Andy borderline stereotype delivery seemed to take the brunt of the criticism for the film. Yet say what you will, at least the character has a strongly discernible personality – something all of the other characters grossly lack. After rescuing Queen Amidala – the woman who will become mother of Luke and Leia – Neeson and McGregor are waylaid on the desert planet Tatooine – a place not especially interesting in the first trilogy and even less so this time around. This allows us to be introduced to the young Anakin Skywalker – later to be Darth Vader – and the plot to laboriously hook him up with his future. The film does have its moments – notably a mid-film desert race riff on the Ben-Hur chariot race that would have been infinitely more effective had it ended earlier – but oddly none of the sequences reach any memorable impact akin to any lesser scene from the original trilogy. Lucas seems far more obsessed with CGI visuals that lack both the believability and punch of effects from 20 years ago than he does with such things as depth, pace and suspense. Neeson acquits himself well as the wise Jedi master, but that pretty much ends the quality acting. Someone forgot to write McGregor a part in this film as he basically stands around looking on. Natalie Portman is lovely, but spends huge chunks of the film speaking in a monotone from behind kabuki make-up and bulky costumes that make her appear a cross between a pagoda and a Chinese New Year dragon. Pernilla August is positively catatonic as Anakin's mother – causing her throwaway revelation of a virgin birth to be near laughable. The less said about Jake Lloyd as Anakin, the better. There is no subtlety or shading to his performance – he comes across as some cross between an over-caffeinated Little Rascal and a mannequin, and screeches the film to a halt every time his character is required to conduct himself in a way beyond his years. Samuel L. Jackson stands out like a sore thumb trotting out his tiresome tough guy riff as Jedi Mace Windu. Beloved droids R2-D2 and C-3PO from the original trilogy are reduced to mere cameos here, as is Yoda, who becomes increasingly underwhelming with each appearance. The film also lacks a strong villain – a problem not solved with Ray Park's all-too-brief appearance as Darth Maul, who turns out to be a rather disappointing character despite his intimidating appearance. A less than auspicious start to the new trilogy.",0

Hype will always outweigh end results. The acting here is lame. The kid who plays Anakin has no personality. He exhibits no signs of being fated to become Darth Vader. There is a disconnect.

It was fun, fast, and fantastic. Explosions, lasers, spaceships, what else could a kid ask for? Then I grew up. I watched the movie again when I was seventeen, and all I could do was gape in horror. I could have sworn I saw a different movie as a child, but going back through it, I couldn't believe that I had liked it so much. It really reminds me as to how my tastes have changed and how what I look for in a movie has changed. As an addition to the Star Wars saga, I didn't begrudge it at the time simply because it was, well, another chapter in the Star Wars saga.

I'll admit the acting and script were on the downside. There were some exceptions though. Liam Neeson was strong in a few scenes and so was Ian Mcdiarmid. You can tell Lucas was not really confident that he could make another SW film. That's why the script was so-so. Jar-Jar is funny in some scenes and annoying in others. Jar-Jar was a risk, but an overall entertaining one. Jake Lloyd was a fair choice for a 9 year old Anakin. Natalie Portman was not given much to work with which is why her performance is just ok.     I have to say I like it overall, we see how things were in the glory days of the galaxy and when Jedi were numerous. The Beginning is an interesting one that starts the most famous saga of all time.

Overall, though, I thought the movie was very good, and the visual effects were stunning.  The action scenes were fast paced and full of tension.

Neeson and McGregor look embarrassed at having to spout the inane dialogue, Natalie Portman is beautiful but once again let down by the script, Jake Lloyd, all I can say is how on earth did he get cast?

The magic of the first 3 Star Wars saga was gone on this movie, where visual effects were truly revolutionary, and the concept unquestionably so also. This was just another sci-fi movie.

I absolutely loved this movie.  And no matter what everyone says, Jar Jar Binks is not annoying.  Well, okay, he started to get on my nerves a couple of times but I still loved him.  He made me laugh a a few times, too.  All of the actors in this film were great, especially Liam Neeson.  He may not win any Oscars for this movie but his performance in this movie blows away the performances by all of the actors in the original trilogy.  Jake Lloyd is a lot better than everyone would lead you to believe him to be.  I was quite surprised that a 9 year old boy could act that good.  He was terrific.  The script of the movie is on par with the best ""Star Wars"" film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  But this movie is more like ""Return of the Jedi"" that the other movies.  The movie could have been a little more serious than it was.  Not that I am complaining, though.  ""Return of the Jedi"" was an outstanding movie, even though it was somewhat childish.  Same here with ""The Phantom Menace"".  But isn't that what ""Star Wars"" is all about?  The movies are made to appeal to the likes of kids.   But I seriously doubt that the kids who this film will fully understand the adult-like plot.  I myself found it a little confusing at times.

So much of my childhood centered around the movies and toys from the original, and now this is an experience much the same for a new generation.

It was wonderfully done, and it provided a refreshing change from the other recent movies, which all seem to be mindlessly violent.

Yes, Jar Jar, instead of being a racist stereotype, turned out to be a great character. My little sisters, ages 9 and 5, absolutely love him, as did I. All child-oriented characters, like Barney and such, get a bad rap because... they're cute. Now that's sad, that just because a character is made to appeal to children, adults ridicule it.That just goes to show that our society is going seriously downhill amid a torrent of adult themes. So, back to the movie, I thought the plot was nifty, as were the special effects. The only thing I have to disagree with is the portrayal of Anakin Skywalker by Jake Lloyd.It's not that Jake's not a great actor, it's just that he's too cute. Too sweet and innocent. Audiences, I think, are going to have a hard time accepting that this adorable angel with become the epitome of evil.Anakin should have been portrayed with more of that darker side, the flaw that will ultimatly lead him to the dark side.",1

It's like all's he had were ""yes men"" around him, because not only did they not dissuade him from the politics problem, but they let him go ape sht with CGI with its anti-septic level of cleanliness and a whole race of Jar Jar Binks. Focused so much on this he was that he neglected to direct human actors which all come off as wooden as a troop of Keanu Reeves. Youngling Anakin Skywalker on the other hand, all of what 10 yrs old, can do no wrong - expert racer, strong with the Force he knows nothing of, then destroys a huge space warship by accident.

The pacing was horrible, too fast to absorb at first and then when they get to Tatooine, it virtually slows to a halt.  Absolutely zero character development too, and Anakin was far too young to be believable. Good for kids and the idiotic masses plebes who enjoy cheap thrills.

There are many defaults in the sequel trilogy that fans love to mock about and its understandable because there are many bad things in this trilogy I would have removed. But now lets focus on The Phantom Menace. There is a lot of talking and negotiations in the film until finally there are actions being taken by the characters. The final battle for example, took to long to happen and could have been pushed forward in the plot. The acting was fine I guess, only a few lines that became a joke in this galaxy. Example for bad writing. At last we have the famous lightsaber battle in every star wars film: Darth maul is a great character and he kicks ass in the sequence. Liam Neeson is good as always with his acting skills and Ewan McGregor is fantastic. Overall it is a solid film. The sequel trilogy started with left foot.",1
737,6.0,"A small brained CGI fest that still managed to pull in 431 million dollars, The Phantom Menace is not without it's merits. What makes the original trilogy great is that aside from the ground breaking effects, there was a sufficient script and competent actors which came together to create a throwback to serials. There is the rub. The Phantom Menace was made with focus groups in mind to appeal to the largest groups of people. The utterly annoying Jar Jar is probably a hit with kids due to his accent and harmless nature while Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor, and Natalie Portman are here to provide credibility. Only Neeson manages to be engaging as Portman doesn't call anything a walking carpet and Mcgregor doesn't do much of anything. The worst offense is the horrendous Yoda puppet that looks angry all the time. Jar Jar is a good representation of what is wrong with this movie; he is a cliché with no character dimension that is flashy and empty. All of the creatures of CGI in this movie are duller than the extras filling the foreground and they aren't tangible. They are streamlined plastic ready to be packaged for the kids. The scenes that manage to entertain are the ones with real people. The Jedi fight scenes, especially the two on one battle with Darth Maul, the racing scene, and the scenes with the surprisingly steady Jake Lloyd are the highlights. If Lucas had only realized that the human factor was what made this series great, he wouldn't have made this artificial void that is the worst of the six Star Wars films.",0
738,,The first film of the new trilogy was a disappointment after the greatness of the first trilogy.  The first problem is its all machine with no soul. The second problem is that there are no compelling characters in the new Star Wars like with the 1977 version with people like Han Solo and Chewbacca.  The third problem is the character of Jar Jar Binks who behaves like a slave from a Caribbean Island during Colonial times.,0

This piece is one long SpFX reel, and even these fail to satisfy. The CGI FX seem surprisingly thin and immaterial (a history of the filmmaking process)--who really cares that either Gungans or 'droids get there just desserts. Let's be honest with ourselves. Everything aside from the central characters are mere scenery that serve no purpose but to distract the audiences from the live actors' bad performances. Jar-Jar Binks manages to flop his way into the center of attention in scenes where we SHOULD be watching the actors in order to be drawn into the progression of the plot. Shame on you, George Lucas.

Ah hell I did. Now for the review: Most people including die-hard Star Wars Fans hate Phantom Menace and consider it the worst in the series. They are dead wrong. The acting is good, not great, but the Star Wars Saga isn't all about acting. Liam Neeson fits the character of Qui-Gon Jinn perfectly, Ewan McGregor would make the late Alec Guinness proud for his portrayal of young Obi-Wan Kenobi. And Ray Park plays Darth Maul well even though he has few lines. The only complaint I have is young Anakin Skywalker played by Jake Lloyd his acting is stale and somewhat annoying. Anyway back to the good parts of the movie. The plot is laid out so that you have to watch the first three movie, can't stand it when people say the plot is no good when those people fail to see how well it's plot coincides with the first three films. Now for the special effects. Many Phantom Menace haters say that George Lucas ruined the movie with all the special effects he used, again, they are dead wrong. If 3D animation technology were available in the 70's George would have used them in the original Star Wars Saga he would have. The proof of this is in the newer versions of Episodes IV-VI all digitally enhanced with special effects. The special effects of Episode I only add to the splendor of the movie. Now to the best part: The Action. Who ever directed the action sequences of this movie is a genius. They are so over the top and fluid, but at the same time are believable and easy to follow. The final fight scene is, in my opinion, The best and most well choreographed fight scene of all time. If you haven't seen the movie yet (I highly doubt it) I wont spoil it for you. In conclusion This a great movie the deserves much more credit than it gets. Oh and buy the way, to all you Episode I haters (you know who you are)""I find your lack of faith disturbing"" -Darth Vader",1
753,9.0,Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace was the first star wars movie I saw in Theaters it was a fun movie the podrace was a lot of fun to watch over this movie was good looking back on this one I really never understood why people hate this one we get to see a young Anakin Skywalker the Lightsaber duel at the end was also fun.,1
754,8.0,"I know there have been hundreds of bad reviews for Star Wars Episode 1 because of many problems, yet I enjoyed it very much. I thought the special effects were phenomenal, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were great in their roles as the Jedi, and Darth Maul was really cool. The number 1 problem I thought was the God awful acting of Jake Lloyd as the extremely important character of Anakin. I have heard some things that people said he's supposed to be like that, all nice and hopeful. I still thought his acting could have been better. If you're reading this Jake Lloyd, know I disliked your acting, no hard feelings. This is really the only big problem I thought. I know hundreds of people hated Jar Jar Binks but he didn't really annoy me as much as Anakin. I actually laughed at Jar Jar's comic relief and my 9th grade friend says Jar Jar is his favorite Star Wars character. I did like Jar Jar despite what other people say. I loved the podrace sequence and the climax. Those were my favorite parts. I liked those Battle Droids, but I do think the Stormtroopers were better. The fight with Darth Maul was great. The guy who played him (I forgot his name)was great I was hoping he wouldn't die, but was happy with the movie and its ending all the same. Overall, I give Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace an 8 out of 10. 2 points for plot, 2 points for acting, 2 points for visual effects, 2 points for its cool characters, and 2 points forit being a Star Wars film. That would give it a 10. Minus 2 for Jake Lloyd's horrible acting. Now Episode 1 gets an 8 out of 10.",1
755,6.0,Why oh why won't Hollywood producers spend some money on decent scripts as well as special effects?  Do they really think we are so stupid that we will just be dazzled by computer generated worlds and characters?  Surely George Lucas is rich enough to care about not just getting people into the cinemas but also ensuring them a quality experience when they get there?  This film seems to me to be a tremendous wasted opportunity to create a great drama around magnificent state of the art special effects and visual wonder.,0
756,7.0,"Now, despite being pretty much a sci fi geek, I wasn't actually aware of Star Wars until the Digitally Remastered box set was released, and as such Episode 1 was the first Star Wars film I saw in the cinema, and I was stunned. It had almost everything, interesting new (or rather, old) technology, nice glimpses into different cultures, fantastic graphics, I'd go as far as to say it was the first film in ages that I felt came close to the standard set by Jurassic Park and awesome sound, the pulsing of Sebulba's Pod Racer's engines as he flew past took my breath away. I left the cinema absolutely wowed, I wouldn't have faulted the film at all. When it was released on video I bought it straight away, and it was the first film I noticed as being somewhat... lacking on video, to me it is very much a film built for the cinema. Furthermore, on about the third or fourth overall watching that critical factor began kicking in. The Jar Jar factor. I'd never much noticed him the two times I saw it in the cinema, in fact the second time I was very much on a ""I don't see what's wrong with Jar Jar"" vibe upon leaving, but for some reason I really saw him on the TV, and I suddenly saw what the big problem was. I also started getting a bit annoyed by the Annakin character, well, more annoyed at the acting than the character. Obviously you can't really expect a child role to be impeccably acted, but I've seen better.",1
757,1.0,"Critics wanted more than anything to love this movie.  As did many die hard fans who simply couldn't forgive storytelling that is not on par with it's predecessors.  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE of critics being closed minded and braindead!  If some dogmatic viewers simply open their eyes, they'd see it's not just the critics.   As for the people who loved this movie, well... some people liked the Fifth Element, so I guess its possible to love this.  One problem for me is the screenplay of Episode one gets bogged down in minor details, and doesn't move from scene to scene with effective pacing.  I don't think its boring, but I will say, it's less exciting, and captivating than it should be.  Too many of the scenes are about small details that don't really have to be there, i.e. so many of the chase scenes against the droids, and the land battle with the Gungans.  That to me was not exciting. The action is more routine here, and doesn't have the element of surprise like the others.  Things get shot, things shoot back, things blows up, things shoot, etc.  It gets very monotonous.   I did very much like the scenes on Tatooine, however.  I think it did capture my imagination, with the exception of that amazingly overrated pod race sequence, complete with obviously CGI characters, and a Pod racer that kills the entire scene for me.  This isn't a bad movie, it's just a disappointment.  This feels more like a 90's movie.  Which place their emphasis on routine action, and effects, and less on character, and interesting backstory.  Watching resent action movies, I always thought to myself, where's the magic that I used to see in movies starting with Star Wars in '77 and pretty much ending with Back to the Future in 85. It appears, that Lucas has fallen to the same mistakes as the so called enemy ""the big studios"" likewise. Nothing against George. He is a wonderful guy. A smart guy, and I think it's too bad that so many disappointed fans have been SO grating on him personally. If I was let down by his movie, and even the next installments, the man still has a heart of gold, and once made pictures that defined the magic of cinema to me. His filmmaking here seems to lack passion, hopefully, he'll get that back with avengeance.  Overall, what I think of this movie?  There are moments, and enough of them, for me to say, heck, it's pretty good.  But I can't help thinking what this could've been.",0
758,9.0,"Star Wars Episode 1 was one of the most anticipated movies ever made. It is a highly underrated movie despite great acting by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor to name a few. The movie also has great special effects, and tons of interesting characters. These also some great scenes like the fight scene where Obi Wan and Qui-Gon Jin face Darth Maul, and of course the pod race. It also has a great villain in Darth Maul. This film has also been bashed by many critics and fans despite a great musical score. Many critics don't understand how great this movie really is but some do like Roger Ebert who gave this movie 3 and a half stars. This movie is only given a 6.4 rating by IMDb despite these factors. Epsidoe 1 deserves a higher rating for its great visuals, and acting but it was rightfully nominated for three Oscars for its brilliance. This movie is also number five on the highest grossing U.S. movies ever made list. Epsidoe 1 deserves more praise for the masterpiece it is and I give it a 9.0 out of 10.",1
759,10.0,"As a fan of Star Wars, I have to say that the movie was excellent. The graphics were simply amazing. The sound effects were mind boggling. It goes right along with the original trilogy. I can't wait until George Lucas releases Episode 2 in 2002. I would recommend this movie to you even if you were not a science fiction fan. The Phantom Menace is the movie to see if you just want to see an excellent movie. George Lucas and his entire crew did an excellent job. ""May the force be with you.""",1

761,8.0,"The Plot: I thought the plot was decent. It wasn't the most creative thing in the world in this episode specifically, but it was okay. The main focus of this episode's plot is all about politics, with Anakin Skywalker becoming Obi-Wan Kenobi's padawan as a child.",0

While I was impressed with the visual dynamics (reported to consist of a record setting 95% of the movie) and while my ears are still ringing from the nearly constant, intense sonic blasts presented by Lucas' latest effort, the movie woefully lacked the 'spark' of the previous releases.

767,,"This was very awful. Where to start? Well, of course Jar Jar was horrible (he looked too computery & sounded awful, but worst of all he didn't do anything worthwhile, let alone 'funny'). The character of Anakin was horrible, both in the writing and the acting. The movie moves way too fast, the characters are never developed, and anything that's interested is soon passed over. The characters are blah, with only a few (Watto, Sebulba, Darth Maul) becoming entertaining & endearing.",0
768,1.0,"Not going against the other Str Wars films or anything, but this is simply the worst one out of the all. Okay, the only thing that was good about it was the lightsaber fight at the end, but that was about it.The characters could of been developed a bit more especially from Darth Maul and Padme. It just didn't satisfy me in a way that all the other ones did. It started to drag of towards the middle a bit, this is mainly because simply there was not enough action or story. About the only believable character within the story was C 3pio and Artoo Di 2. But this is nothing special, nothing exciting and nothing breath taking as of the old films.",0

Jar Jar Binks is a silly character, what more needs to be said? This does have a fine cast though, especially Liam Neeson as Obi-Wan's mentor, who is the real backbone to the film,; pity not much is revealed about his own personal story. Ewan McGregor is believable as a much younger version of Obi-Wan, and does the role originated by Sir Alec Guiness proud, along with Natalie Portman as Queen Amedalia.",0
773,,"OK its 2003.  4 years after the Phantom Menace and still the critics are harping on Episode 1.  Now it may not have been the best film ever made or even the best Star Wars film but it is by far not the worst sequel ever made as E online would have you to believe.  It even beat out BATMAN AND ROBIN for the dubious honor.  BATMAN AND ROBIN is a film where everyone involved deserved to be locked away for there total lack of effort and respect towards the source material, from the acting to the writing to the set design, to the direction.

774,4.0,Only because of the name Star Wars is what kept the Phantom Menace from flopping in the first place. And only because it was the first Star Wars movie in 16 years is what allowed it to be the top movie in 1999.,1
775,8.0,"The Phantom Menace is better than I remember. It's well constructed, and there are incredible subtleties and thematic elements hidden among the flashy (and cheesy) A-plot. It's about dualities, symbiosis, and most of all, misdirection. An elaborately costumed decoy queen, an invasion waged to maneuver the Senate into giving Palpatine more power, and so on. And the movie is that too: a big flashy effects and battle and comedy extravaganza in front of a master manipulator quietly going about his scheming.",1

The Force is cool, but it should really be de-mystified into a scientific concept, like bugs in your blood. We wouldn't want people to think that anyone could be Jedi through hard work and integrity. Nope, your ability level is measurable and determined at birth. Rather than tell an interesting and compelling story, how about we give the most screen-time to a CGI side-character that doesn't matter at all to the larger story!""",0

Now I don't hate George Lucas as a person, I don't even know him. I hate him as a screenwriter and as a director. It's apparent that George's creativity well, went dry in 1983. (After writing Return of The Jedi) I know you can't please everybody, I know this probably wasn't what sprang to mind when fans Imagined how Anakin Skywalker fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader, but after watching the prequel films, you have to wonder what George's intentions were for this trilogy. To take the fans on a fantastic journey, To tell us how how the story began? or to fatten his wallet and increase his bank account? After watching these movies, I can clearly tell that it wasn't the former.",0
780,1.0,"I recently saw this film on video, the first time I'd sat through it since last Summer. I was amazed to find it was even worse than I had originally thought. The lack of a plot of any description is a serious problem, but only one among many. The script seems to have been fine-tooth-combed to remove any sense of identity or individuality on the part of the characters, giving the performances the air of those in a school play scripted by a 12 year old. Let's not even bother with the fact that the effects are abysmal and the enemy storm troopers have the prescence and menace of a glove puppet.",0
781,6.0,The phantom menace is a very interesting movie in my opinion because I do understand the hate behind it but it's not as bad as people say it is. The cast is good for the most part but there is a few members of the cast that are just awful and not great for example young Anakin his casting choice was just awful in every way. The most of the characters are good but as I said previously young Anakin is awful and jar jar binks is just an awful character In all senses of the word. There is some good scenes in this movie from the pod racing scene to the ending fight with death maul. The music is always good by John williams. But onto the things I don't like about. Like I said jar jar binks and Anakin are terrible characters in this movie jar jar is just so annoying and Anakin is just a brat throughout the whole movie he doesn't listen to what he is told to do. The structure of the movie is awful to don't get me wrong the story in this movie is great but the execution is just so sloppy and bad. The pacing in this movie is terrible also like it's all over the place. The villain in darth maul is very weak in my opinion don't get me wrong he is really cool but when you look into his character development there really isn't any at all which just sucks because he is a great villain In concept but his execution is just bad. Overall the phantom menace is just very mediocre yes it has its pros but the cons sadly outweigh them.,0
782,8.0,"First of all no movie series has changed the movies like Star Wars. Second everyone i know criticize this movie as childish, boring, poorly directed, and bad acting. Well i also seem to remember how everyone went to see it several times and how most of you probably own it. It still today has one of the absolute greatest lightsabre battle. Let forget that Jar-Jar was in the movie, then what do you have to criticize, sure the boy was only OK but this was a role any Star Wars fan would have taken and still would knowing what people think of it. You know that you loved the lightsabre battle at the end and how you drooled as the new generation of special effects was brought in yet again as Jedi battled of against evil when you first saw The Destroyer Droids. Seriously this movie was judged mainly on what others have said. Just think about when you watched it for the first time. Before you heard others' opions, you know you loved it. -Hope this was useful -may the force be with you -always",1
783,6.0,"The Phantom Menace is like a roller coaster ride with a very long climb up the first hill.  Everyone can't help being excited by the Star Wars logo and the music.  And what follows in the first fifteen minutes is visually spectacular.  But then the movie becomes awfully gabby until the pod race. Is it worth seeing?  Yes.  Worth seeing twice?  Maybe.  I now feel that the critical backlash was too harsh, and that while Lucas may have written a confusing script, he still seems humble in his desire to entertain.  My one big complaint is that the sleek, silver troopers collapse like boiled broccoli at the slightest touch--they pose no threat.  And Jar Jar Binks seemed stoned to me.  He looks like he never got out of Woodstock.  But this is worth the trip and the wait.  And it sets up for very interesting things to come.",1

Jar Jar (obviously)<br /><br />02.

786,8.0,"Since 1999, when The Phantom Menace became the first new Star Wars movie in 16 years, there has been much bemoaning by Star Wars fans about how this movie, as well as Episode II: Attack of the Clones, ruined the Star Wars franchise. I shared similar thoughts, but after watching both movies recently, they may not be on the same playing field as Empire Strikes Back, but you cannot tell me that it is any worse than Return of the Jedi. The Phantom Menace may have Jar Jar Binks, but at least it doesn't have any Ewoks. The Phantom Menace is a visionary wonder, ushering in the digital revolution that has been the impossible now routine in movies. Entire characters, cities, space battles were designed and executed on computers here in breathtaking beauty. The complaints about the Star Wars ""prequels,"" as Episodes I and II have become known as, have not been over special effects. The outcry with these films have been the story. Sure, I wish more had happened to get Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) closer to becoming Darth Vader in this movie, but we did see the meeting between Obi-Wan Kenobi (the very good Ewan McGregor, he sounds so much like a young Alec Guinness, it's scary), we do get to see some outstanding light sabre battles between Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Darth Maul (Ray Park), and the eternal scheming by the future Emporer, here only a Senator, Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Yes, Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) is in this movie, but he's no more annoying than the Ewoks were. The movie is a solid one. And since it's the first chapter of a story, even those not familiar with the Star Wars saga can enjoy it. The pod race sequence is visually wonderful, and there are some real human emotions that do make their way into The Phantom Menace. Any one who goes away to college can sympathize with Anakin as he leaves his mother to become a Jedi. For the bashers out there, get off your high horse, step back and look at The Phantom Menace again and try to enjoy it. You never know, you may end up liking it.",1

If you believe that a grate kids movie will be grate for adults then I'll tell you that this isn't one of those. The movie (whole quasi-star wars prequel trilogy) lacks the mysticism of the original series. Thats the main problem. In the original trilogy you had knights, wizards, spiritual power and a princess. In the new series you only have a princess and wannabe knights and wizards with some kind of organism living in them which gives them the force (what????). Where is that Lucas from the 70's gone? The one that wrote about people with unexplainable powers, a force flowing through them that is in all living things.

They also hated Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and said that he took away from the seriousness of the movie, but what about the Ewoks? Besides, now that I watch it again, he really wasn't THAT annoying. It was also said that there was no plot and what there was was too confusing. First, its the beginning of the end, what with Ian McDiarmand acting all evil and what-not, and it introduces the bad guys AND good guys for the entire series. I found most of the acting was exceptional, especially Liam Neeson. Ewan McGregor wasn't in it that much, but he did kick...butt against Ray Park (Darth Maul) at the end. There was very good foreshadowing and, except for a couple bits with widdle Anakin and Jar Jar, this movie was right on target. I think that people expected Darth Vader to be in it, and Han and Luke and everyone, but that wasn't the story. I may be a minority with this movie, but Good job, George Lucas.",1

It is not a mindless adventure you can just watch for the action, there is a plot you need to follow, and a good one at that!

Just knowing how popular of a character he was, it was interesting to see him go pretty much just like *that*. The Naboo queen decoy was a bit questionable too. Who's queen exactly, Padme or Amidala (or are those names the same person in some way)!? Than again, the decoy idea seemed to have help during one of the fights. But other than that, this film as a whole is a neat start to the Star Wars series. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the pod race.

It's also Interesting to see such a young Natalie Portman and Kiera Knightley! And it's sad seeing Liam Neeson dead already.

McGregor does give a stellar performance as Obi-Wan (and I might actually like him more than Alec Guinness) Nesson and Park also give some solid performances, but Lucas's direction feels so odd that sometimes they get lost in the ground. Anakin is a little twerp (which personally is not what I want to see from the future Dark Lord of the Sith) and don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks. The film isn't all bad, in fact for some it may be a guilty pleasure, the beginning and end are also quite fun to watch (when you're not cringing) but the middle drags on, and feels super boring.

Well, the film starts off with the most uneventful intro to the film (I don't mean the title crawl, I mean the 'negotiation' on the ship). Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor just sleep through their lines because George Lucas didn't care. Jake Lloyd is one of the worst child actors ever cast in a major role, and it's a shame because you can look at the behind-the- scenes footage and see that way more talented kids auditioned for the role. I know he suffers from schizophrenia now from all the bullying he got from this movie, and it's awful, but it isn't his fault he cant act. I blame Lucas because it was up to him to cast him, and even if he was a bad actor, Lucas should've directed him better. The plot is stupid and unimportant. Nobody cares about these trade federations or whatever, we want to see engaging action! And then it goes on this political statement tirade about racism involving the Gungans and the humans? This is Star Wars, not CNN. The effects are cartoonish and fake, and the unholy sin of Star Wars, being Jar Jar Binks, has WAYYY too much screen time. There will never not be a moment in time where I don't hate every second of this rubbish film.",0

There's still a lot about TPM that I don't care for, but at least it felt like it belonged in the Star Wars Universe.

I should have known better; I wasn't even a huge fan of the original three films. But GEEZ! Couldn't Mr. Lucas, producer of the great Indiana Jones entities among other things have come up with something BETTER??? I mean, R2D2 and C3PO had NO place in this film. They were just there to appease certain Pez candy dispenser collecting freaks in the audience (you know who you are). The costumes were not clever, though one could tell they were trying so desperately to be. I'll admit the special effects and sound were good, but there simply were too many special effects and not enough substance!",0

804,4.0,"We've all been waiting quite a while for George Lucas to come out with his highly-anticipated prequels for the Star Wars Trilogy.  And while this one fills the void somewhat, I would be lying to say that I wasn't disappointed. While the much-touted fx are quite extravagant, Lucas glops it on, like so much computer-generated katsup, covering up the gaping hole created by a thin story & even thinner characters.  As usual, everything in the Star Wars universe is shown in black and white: you are either good or evil, no shades in between, no complex characters or motivations that complicate real life, where on occasion good people perform evil deeds, etc.  No, that would take too much effort to show.  The bad characters are obviously, irredeemably bad, and are made-up to show it, while the good characters are flawlessly good.  While I liked the scenes showing the planets, but didn't care much for the people who inhabited them - the Naboo are obviously the ""white"" people, and they are rather bland and vanilla; the leathery Gronks (sp?) are the ""dark"" people, and are given a horrifying accent & exaggerated movements; the Trade Federation people seem only interested in money & have pretty obvious ""oriental"" accents.  I'm not sure what Lucas is trying to say here, but it seems fairly sophmoric.  Let's get one thing fairly clear here: Ja'r Ja'r, or whatever the hell his name is, is a constant irritation & obvious plot device.  He's worse than that annoying little kid that ruined Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom.  And while we're at it, Anakin Skywalker is pretty irritating too, although that maybe partially blamed on a weak script and some pretty amateurish acting.  Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor are both fine, especially McGregor, whom we hope has more to do and say in the next picture. Natalie Portman trys to overcome the shortcomings of the script, and that's good for something I guess.  The fight scenes with Darth Mol are very good; I wish moore had been shown - except what's up with the orange laser door thing??  Too many things happen for no explainable reason; these poorly masked plot devices which are used to push the moovie along manage to drain much of the energy of the film.  This is especially true of ""The Force"", the supreme deus ex machina which allows the good characters to get away with practically anything, no matter how ludicrously far-fetched. This moovie also finally shows something even more useless than imperial stormtroopers: the Republic battle 'droids.  These pathetic metal fodder spend the entire moovie shooting their little laser guns, hitting nothing, and getting decimated by everything.  As a matter of fact, Naboo is invaded and involved in a war, but you'd never know because almost no one dies, there is no blood, and the only ones who get ""killed"" are the poor battle 'droids - but it's ok because they are robots, and they don't count, so bring yer kiddies so we can sell moore toys.  Yes, this sounds a bit cynical, because this could have been a great, mammoth moovie, if only Lucas had put some time and effort into telling a good story with well-rounded characters, instead of loading up the eye-candy.  But if you liked Independence Day or Armageddon, ie ""see shiney things go boom"", chances are you'll love this as well.  I think die-hard Star Wars fans will be disappointed at the lack of depth.",0

No, this is not as good as the original trilogy. However, the movie does introduce us to characters who we already know and love from the original trilogy in their younger form. The film's characters are not as memorable as the characters in the original trilogy, nor is the story as compelling. There are some very nice special effects, and basically that's what this movie is riding on, the spectacle of the special effects.

It's something much more evil and sinister - the excessive use of computer animation.

This is something you'd expect from some low-budget, Ed Wood-type B-movie, but not from the great George Lucas, a man with unlimited time, budget, resources, etc. to make this movie with. How is it possible that with 10+ years of advancement, the special effects of this movie still leave me yearning for the stop-action Tauntauns from ""The Empire Strikes Back""? But it's not entirely the obviously unbalanced ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" appearance that gives it its cartoonish quality. It's also (if not more so) the hideously unfunny personality of Jar Jar Binks, who could only entertain someone with the IQ of Bantha fodder. That's not to say that it isn't an otherwise great movie. There are excellent scenes. Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan's dual with Darth Maul almost made me forget the Saturday morning cartoon I had been watching only moments earlier. When people say this movie is a masterpiece, I agree. It's just unfortunate there's so many awful things about it that also make it a flop. I'll be looking forward to the Special Edition version where they superimpose a realistic-looking and much less idiotic character on top of Jar Jar.",1

Well, it was successful at the box-office, but most critics and fans didn't like it, probably because of the Original trilogy. But I like it, I think is underrated. It's a nice popcorn flick, with an awesome fight scenes, special effects and make up. John Williams made a great music for the movie.

But the script was lame, the was not sense of urgency and the great evil presence that over shadowed Episodes IV, V and VI simply wasn't there. And then there's Darth Maul - what a grave disappointment. Good movies have great bad guys and Vader is one of the all-time greats. Darth Maul is extraneous fight scene filler (albeit well-done).

Liam Neeson and Evan McGregor kind of keep tight, but from the horrible delivery of the blunt lines by the supporting cast, to all the stupid little nuances of the extras, the discoordinated settings, to the messy cinematography and editing, everything is a testimony to Lucas' inability to run a tight ship.

838,10.0,"This review may contain spoilers. First of all let me say that I have never paid any attention to critics and I always form my opinion on simply watching something firsthand.I saw this film when it first opened and I saw it five times after.The criticism that this film gets is very unjust and wrong.This film perfectly sets up the Star Wars story and introduces us to some of the characters that we have known for years.For instance Anakin Skywalker is introduced and completely fleshed out, i personally think that making Anakin a very kind and good natured boy was an interesting and well thought out idea, not to mention the fair performance delivered by Jake Lloyd.I may also add that some of the sequences in this movie are extremely well done and artistic (the shots of Naboo are beautiful)and the direction is magnificent, Lucas relies on well paced shots as compared to the shaky all over the place camera work of LOTR.And on to Jar-Jar Binks, I have always loved the character and I feel that his addition to the story really helps to move the plot and basically allows the queen to re-claim Naboo from the Trade Federation.There is absolutely nothing wrong with Jar-Jar or any character from this movie for that matter.And to talk about underrated, Liam Neeson gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a film, his grace and powerful presence really heightens this amazing film.I also know many other people who enjoy and appreciate this film.How this film's rating is so low baffles me, i truly feel that this and Episode 2 are unmatched by anything that has been released in recent years.This is true cinematic genius.The duel at the end of this film is one of the most exciting action scenes i have ever witnessed and the music is absolutely incredible.This film is packed with drama and rich storytelling techniques.Dont let disgruntled anti-Lucas idiots ruin this experience for you.This movie is unique and extremely entertaining.The force is very strong with this one.10/10",1

840,10.0,"TPM is a brilliant film and does live up to my expectations. I absolutely love the first trilogy, so when i first watched Episode 1,My thoughts before watching it were that it couldn't be bad, as i love the whole concept of star wars so much. In my opinion it is just as good as the others. Many people say that it does not live up to the original and people are mainly annoyed because of the comic character, jar jar Binks. I think this character is fine as he helps Qui-gon jinn and obi-wan along the way and adds a small amount of humour to the film. And thats what hes for. Admitedly he is more entertaining for younger viewers, i remember loving him when i first saw it, at the age of 9, which is probably why i still like the character now. The idea of having Anakin as a small boy is a nice idea, as it shows us how good Darth Vader once was, and how much he changes, due to changes in his life. Ewan Gregor gives it his all and you can truly believe that he is the obi-wan kenobi from the original trilogy. I also loved Qui-gon, as it shows obi-wan as a padawan, not a master, so you can view him in a different light. Palpatine is brilliant, and I'm glad they kept the same actor from Return of the Jedi. He acts well, in the film, and it is a struggle to believe that he is a sith lord, making his way up to power. I love the way Lucas has done this, making him string the senators and Padme along until he is a chancellor, which he becomes, giving away nothing at all. We are left only with a small hint at the end of the film, when the camera moves along to his face, when Yoda and mace-windu, who is also an amazing character, are talking of the sith. Obviously, if you are a star wars fan you know whats going on, but if you are a first viewer, it gives no big clues. The action and special effects are a bonus, a brilliant, under rated film!!!!!!",1

846,,"Let me get it out of the way, I really like The Phantom Menace. While there was a lot of indifference when the film was released, I really enjoyed it. The first prequel to the fantastic original trilogy may not be the strongest film of the Star Wars series, or even one of the best blockbusters to come out of Hollywood, it is nevertheless an entertaining ride with a lot to recommend it. First of Liam Neeson is perfect as Qui-Gon-Jinn (I hope that spelling is right). The nearest that we Northern Irish have to a movie star of our own without doubt the best actor in it. His commanding presence and wonderful delivery of his lines recalls Alec Guinness. That's not to say that Ewan McGregor isn't good as the young Obi Wan as he is superb also. While his accent attempt may be a little too English for some, he is better than would have been expected. In saying that Natalie Portman brings the film down a bit. Her performance is, dare I say, a little wooden at time, which is a surprise considering her fantastic performances in Leon and Beautiful Girls. She is undeniably beautiful as Queen Amidala (she is the mother of Princess Leia, she has to be beautiful), but her performance needed a lot more work. Likewise Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Some child actors can be great, but Lloyd just sleep walks through the film and considering the importance of the character he is playing, it does damage the film a little.",1

Liam Neeson is the perfect Jedi leader with Ewan as Obi Wan who plays the part well. And I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually liked the character Jar Jar Binks. Jack Lloyd made a fair act playing the young Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. The Queen is cool and Padme is sweet, plus Palpatine is very crafty with his duel persona as the Sith lord Darth Sideous. Now this film wasn't perfect for one thing, one of the coolest Star Wars villains has only ten minutes of screen time in the entire picture. Darth Maul was a great henchman, his role was perfect for the film. Plus he looked great with the horns and he had the two sided lightsabre. The last battle between him and the two Jedi's is great too! I liked the pod race with Anakin and the droid battle with Jar Jar. But there are times you can tell the film is real hokey, just look at Yoda. Plenty of times he's on screen he looks like a puppet. Samuel L. Jackson is good as Windu who you see later in the saga, putting on a good role. The plot is twisted a lot but works with the Queen being in danger of being destroyed by a droid army sent out by the Sith. The acting is done greatly and the special affects are the same, breath taking. This is a good Star Wars film and a good way to kick off the first episode of the prequel trilogy, highly recommended. Star Wars Episode 1 gets the big 9, only a notch away from being perfect like Parts 4 and 5. Enjoy!",1

Then I saw the commentary before the special edition, and I caught myself rewinding and rewinding at every other shot to catch the movie again. This is a darn good movie I said to myself, and I still think I am right as I write this. One of the few flaws I could think of is that the pace of the last scene is so quick that it gives you a feeling of having been rushed to the exit. The pacing of the various events that happen also prevented me from appreciating the unfolding of the story, which is quite excellent, even if it gave me the same deja vu feeling of watching the sequel Back to the Future after the original when I compared it to the first movie. Speaking of pacing, I thought Natalie Portman was gorgeous as always, but she walked awfully fast for the type of princess she seemed to portray.

As of this writing, this movie is already ranked #64 on IMDB's top 250 films...it goes to show just how easily people are influenced by hype.  George Lucas himself has stated that the target audience for this film consists of teenage males.  Yet people who are quite grown have made comments here in which they try to look for reasons to make this film seem great, when it's not anywhere near great.  It's not a terrible movie, but it's too much of a kiddie film, and has WAY too much computer animation. This movie will become a success at the box office (inevitably) and it won't be because it deserves to be a success, but because hype has an overwhelming influence on some people, who will go back to the theater to see it over and over again.  What was George Lucas thinking???  This movie looks like a mixture of a Disney movie of the week, a Saturday morning cartoon, and the movie ""Toy Story"".  It's incredible how much computer animation was used in this film.  All the emphasis was placed on the visuals...TOO MUCH emphasis. The visuals were very beautiful, but not enough emphasis was placed on the story.  Don't get me wrong...I love the original Star Wars movies.  I have them on video, and have seen each one of them countless number of times. But this film is so UNLIKE the original Star Wars movies.  If a person who hasn't seen the previous three Star Wars movies goes to see this film, they won't really understand what's going on.  They'll think this is just some movie about a young queen trying to save her planet.  In the other three movies, ""the force"" was a very significant element--it was almost like the intervention of God.  In this film, the whole concept of ""the force"" is almost nonexistent.  Lucas should've let this film be directed by the guy who directed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (which is the best Star Wars film--even Leonard Maltin gave it four stars).  I'm not going to get into specific details about characters or scenes, but I will say that the movie was lame enough, but Jar-Jar totally DESTROYED the movie for me.  If I were to see this movie again, it would be to admire the visuals, nothing more.  Some users have made comments that people who go to see this film with high expectations are going to be disappointed, thus end up not liking this film.  I disagree.  What ACTUALLY HAS happened is that some Star Wars fans who LOVE this film have gone to see this film with preconceived notions: since it's a Star Wars film, they automatically assume that it's a great film, and that's why THEY like it.  They're not seeing this film for what it really is: mediocre.  If I had to describe this film with one word, that word would be ""unbelievable"", but not in a good way.

This movie isn't that great, and maybe it's just the nostalgia factor paired with the fact that I have the ability to enjoy even the crappiest of movies, but I can't fully dislike this movie.<br /><br />To me, ""Episode I"" feels very much like ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""; there's a lot of stuff I love- the world, a few characters, the overall direction of the story, but from a cinematic standpoint, there's still a lot to be desired.",1

I happened to love it for all that it is, and all that people hated about this artform, I also loved.  I loved the CGI in this film, Jar Jar made me howl, the pod race was breathtaking, Darth Maul was perfect and the lightsabre battle at the end was right up there with the battle in Empire and Return.  Natalie Portman was a beautiful queen and Jake Lloyd played young Anakin wonderfully.  George Lucas directed with a frenzied energy and John Williams score was heartstopping.  It filled you with emotion and I could listen to that soundtrack with the lights off in my room any day or night.  The script was funny and it also had it's share of lessons and Jedi folklore.  The Jedi council was a great introduction into what Jedi's were like before "" A New Hope.""  Ewan McGregor was perfect as a young Obi Wan Kenobi, even nailing down his accent and dialect perfectly. Liam Neeson was perfectly subdued as the veteran Jedi Master and teacher. And the editting was sensational as it managed to paste together five simultaneous situations at then end and this is what kept you breathless. The Emperor story was also fun and it gave you a history as to where he came from.  I loved everything about this film.  There are not many films that come out that make you feel like you are back in the 80's when pure entertainment like Raiders and Rambo and Back To The Future graced our screens.  But The Phantom Menace does and it concentrates on entertaining the crowd for the full 120 minutes that it is on screen.  And this is one of the best movies to come out this summer ( I still hold Blair Witch as the pinnacle of all films this summer, TPM is a close second).  I think when people cut this film up it's because people want to hate it.  It is cool to be able to go to work and say "" I just didn't like it. ""  After all, it sounds much more intellectual if you can go there and say that you enjoyed A Midnight Summer's Dream more than Star Wars.  And you know what?  It also makes you a liar.  Star Wars is pure entertainment.  It captures the child in every one of us and brings back to a time when we were kids again.  It is a movie that for two hours takes our minds off of deranged killers going into brokerage firms and shooting everyone, it takes us away from Columbine and away from headlines of animal beatings and mass genocide in Europe. These are things that we have to deal with in the real world, but in the theater when the lights go down and those words appear before us "" A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.... "" we just sit back and let our minds go and enjoy what is on screen.  Star Wars The Phantom Menace is a great film and it is a treasure to finally be able to watch this film after 16 years of purgatory.  And I am not disappointed in the film.

873,,"Took me 5 years to eventually get around to see this. Only serendipitously too, as I sauntered down Lexington Ave, trying to kill time before a rendezvous, I happened upon a seedy antique/junk store. There covered with dust, hidden amongst forgotten B classics, and gay porn, I found this movie. My time had finally come. I shelled out the 5 bux, and threw it in my bag. Verdict: I liked it. One thing I had never been able to get out of people was just how good is it compared to its predecessors. My opinion, its in the same ballpark, somewhere between the first two and the weaker Return of the Jedi. The storyline is very simple, and the dialogue none too clever, but all in all it works and seems a fitting introduction to the saga the entire world knows so well. The obligatory 'chariot race' action sequence, as well as the obligatory 'duel to the death', both are imaginative, new and expertly delivered. One thing negative; where the first two movies raised interesting questions and puzzles, and left you hungry for answers, this movie is all answers. Almost as if Lucas feels he is running out of time, and that the remaining installments won't be sufficient to reveal all he has to tell. In that, it's sort of hokey. I don't think we, as viewers really needed this. Example: C3PO was assembled as a sort of toy in Darth Vader's youth? All I can say is we better see what happened to his memory banks that erased all recollection of that, and his time on the planet he returns to in the original Star Wars. As for my one line summary? What are we to think? That since there are virtually no African Americans in Star Wars, which takes place AFTER this, that only Billy Dee Williams survived into future generations? It's kind of silly. JaJa Binx got bad press. He's actually got some funny moments. One thing, I know this was made in the mid 90s, but the scene at the Republican senate was eerily similar to what is taking place in the UN today. The democratically elected Queen's planet has obviously been invaded, but the terrorist invading force is able to manipulate an impotent bureacracy, and filibuster condemnation and action, by ordering a frivoulus full-scale investigation.

The ''political'' part of the movie was meh, and in some parts doesn't makes sense at all, the political system of the Republic is flawed and confusing and I don't know how such thing could it last for millenia.

I won't give out the story, but to tell you the truth there wasn't much. It was a pretty dry dialog from beginning to end. But it did introduce the characters, and the special effects were excellent. (Although I could still tell what was CG and what wasn't). Overall I give it a 8 out of 10. Hopefully, the next movies will be more detailed. Don't get me wrong it was one of the best movies I've seen, just not THE best. Friends of mine told me they enjoyed it more, because it made numerous references to the books.

897,5.0,"For all the hate surrounding The Phantom Menace, it's a completely fine (if wholly unremarkable) film. The only element that stood out was the visuals - the underwater world, the pod race, and the light saber battle all looked great. The movie was more of a world building film than anything else, which certainly limits its upside as it didn't have a chance to be fresh and revolutionary, but it's completely competent in that world building mode. Learning about the politics both of the Federation and the Jedi council were interesting and well done, and meeting a young Anakin was cool. Many of the characters were flat - particularly the Queen, who looked like she was directed to be as wooden and lacking in personality as possible. The plot was fine but didn't hold significant intrigue, and while the climactic light saber battle was great to look at, the stakes didn't feel serious. It has plenty of flaws, but particularly with it feeling more like world building than plot development, none of them felt fatal. By no means is it a memorable or great movie, but it's also not a dissatisfying one.",1
898,9.0,"The editing style of the Phantom Menace is not supposed to occur in real-time. A scene will pause at a point of climax, then take you away from it for more dramatic reasons. Because the following scene is in another time and place, it makes sense to be able to go back to the earlier scene, right where we left off. There are many movies that use this method, for it is a stylistic editing choice which lends more suspense. The droid armies are used because they are what is realistic for the events occuring. Until human clone soldiers come along in Episode II, there is no other way for a small entity (i.e. The Trade Federation, working under Darth Sidious' direction), to take over an entire world in secret. It would be like the Department of Agriculture of our world putting out recruitment posters for troops, for some unspecified take-over. When it is seen how unreliable thousands of droids are on the battlefield, the clones are commissioned.   As for the acting, you should go watch some of the old 1930's Flash Gordon serials. George Lucas has always been emulating these type of films with his own Star Wars trilogy, and has even stated that the wooden acting is on purpose as a homage to those early sci-fi films. And lastly, the narrative of the film is not meant to flow as a focused single story, because all of these separate story threads all contribute to building the entire saga as a whole. Granted, many audience members not very familiar with the original trilogy (i.e. specific lines, et cetera), will question many side-quests, characters, and lines of dialogue of the Phantom Menace, but if you know the original trilogy very well, and you know where the series is heading, then everything makes sense, and is there for a reason. Also, the ""Phantom Menace"" is none other than Senator Palpatine (who unbeknownst to even the Jedi, is actually the future Emperor, as well as the current Darth Sidious).",0
899,10.0,"While the original Star Wars grabbed me more, besides the fabulous special effects and spacecrafts in Episode I, what I liked about ""The Phantom Menace,"" more than any other Star Wars movie, is Qui-Gon. Liam Neeson, beyond brilliant. He portrayed the Jedi Master so beautifully, his kindness, resolve, his majestic beauty. Qui-Gon, the epitome of what the Jedi should be; a pity the Jedi Council didn't seem too thrilled with his ways. It is Jedi like Qui-Gon who break the rules when they need to be broken that save the Universe both on physical and spiritual levels. If it wasn't for Qui-Gon, we all know Balance in the Force would never come. It is Qui-Gon's gentle altruistic philosophy, his kind heart and willingness to go beyond the boundaries to help others and trust the will of the Living Force, that make this movie better than any other.",1
900,8.0,This movie is hard to really talk about. We all knew it wasnt going to be better than the original and it wasnt. I really like Ewan Mcgregor as the part of Obi Wan Kenobi and i liked seeing Liam Neeson playing Qui Gon Jin but i feel that Lucas did not work as hard on this film as he did in the other ones. Ill just tell you one thing COMPUTER ANIMATION SUCKS! I liked it in Toy story and stuff like that but when did Lucas use it in the original. Hardly ever really! I think its ok to have animation used in movies but people over do it nowadays and it looks so fake its not even funny. This is the case here. It as if youre watching a cartoon at times. Which is ok but i went to see star wars and not a cartoon. I thought the story line was all right though. Jar Jar binks they could have done without but i didnt mind him so much either. It was the animation that bugged me. I hope Lucas works a heck of alot harder in the prequels to be because to me its just laziness to use animation instead of frame by frame.,0
901,1.0,And no I don't say that because it was so terrible (which it was) I say that because in the grand story arc of the prequels (as a trilogy unto themselves) and in the extended Star Wars saga TPM adds nothing to the narrative. They should have just started where the Clone Wars started.,0
902,9.0,"When I first saw The Phantom Menace, I felt like I was four years old again, and seeing Star Wars for the first time.  Some critics and naysayers will pick apart the plot and eventually point out holes, and others will complain about the acting.  But for amazing visuals, great special effects and the beginning story of the Star Wars saga, you can't go wrong.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are great in the roles of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman brings a solid determination to the character of Queen Amidala that is seen in Princess Leia in the current trilogy.  Jake Lloyd is not as bad as some have said he is.  He's a kid, playing a kid.  He enjoys pod racing, which is quite exciting, and he is completely unaware of the fate that awaits him.  The duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and the very sinister Darth Maul outdoes the duels from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi combined.  Watching these three Jedi duel was quite amazing.  The sound and flashes of color as the sabers collied was quite exhilarating.  Even though Darth Maul wasn't in the film much, he makes a lasting impression that.  That's pretty much how Boba Fett's popularity got started.  So, take the kids, skip work, and become a child again, ready to be amazed at the wonders that George Lucas has presented for our viewing pleasure.  The saga begins, again.",1

But they've been extinct for a millennium(!)"" As if Yoda wouldn't know that.

916,6.0,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a flawed, fun film that begins the trilogy leading up to the story found in the 1977 blockbuster film Star Wars. George Lucas once again writes and directs and produces and his talent in all three areas is evident. Without re-hashing the plot(for which the volumes of previous reviews can do), Lucas uses some of the elements from his earlier three films and expands on them in this film. The tie-in for me seemed seamless and a perfect fit, at least in the story. We get a young Anikhan Skywalker(Darth Vader) here, Obi-Ben, C-3PO, R2D2, Yoda, and even Jabba the Hut. And also the man who will become the evil, insidious Emperor. We get new characters as well. Some work very nicely(the queen and Quagon(?)), while others are not quite as effective. Jar-Jar Binks is the film's comic relief, and though he has moments of amusement - he also takes some credibility away from the serious nature and believability of the story. Lucas also relies way too heavily on CGI effects. It seems virtually everything is computer generated. But these for me are small criticisms. Overall, I really enjoyed The Phantom Menace. It has a pretty good story, some solid acting performances(Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor doing a nice Alec Guiness, Ian McDiarmind, Natalie Portman, and the young boy playing little boy Darth), some exciting, visually stunning special effects, and just lots of entertainment bang for your entertainment buck.",1
917,8.0,"The phantom menace was one of the most innocent films of the star wars saga and most child-like as in this one we see kids for the first time in these films along with a character, Jar Jar that can sure give children across the world a new favorite character.

918,4.0,"The Phantom Menace is a boring mess. Its plot is overstuffed with dry exposition and convoluted politics. The characters are generic and shallow. There's no main protagonist or sincere drama to connect with. Dialogue is stale, relationships are cold, and motivations are impersonal. Overall, the script lacks humanity and relatability. Some viewers might force investment because of the Star Wars brand, but that external factor is the only reason to care. Plus, the acting is stiff, rarely elevating the flat material. Particularly, the child performances are grating and distracting. Simply put, The Phantom Menace emotionally flops.",0

920,3.0,"Sadly, this edition in the Star Wars saga is probably the worst. Leaving aside the nostalgic and also the controversial parts of the movie, one left with a very uninteresting plot, directed in a ham fisted manner, and executed entirely in front of a green screen. That green screen and the weak graphics it displays is probably the worst part of the movie... until, that is, you stumble on to some of the dialogue and acting. The movie drags from the start and portions of the action seem less designed for the on-screen interest than for the potential later ride/video game. I suppose one must see it to understand the rest of Star Wars, but perhaps finding a Lego version or a much edited copy is the way to go.",0
921,1.0,When the first ewok showed up in Star Wars three I knew that the whole fantasy was finished. However I didn't foresee that Lucas would trash the previous two with idiotic CGI and effects borrowed from Star Trek. That was bad enough but this film has so much rubbish in it that Star Wars can be said to be officially dead. Alec Guinness was right – he never wanted to do another episode after the New Hope and it is hard to believe that the original won 7 Oscars. Whatever moron thought up Jar Jar Binks he should remember that he has single handedly destroyed the finest Sci Fi film ever made. Back in 1977 I was in London and remember the larger-than-life photos in Leicester Square and the sense of wonder as we all caught our breath during the final chase scene. Nowadays the name Star Wars simply invokes a sense of disgust.,0
922,,"Limited thrills and excitement in this highly anticipated return to the phenom (conglomerate may be more appropriate) known as Star Wars. Lucas is big on effects, effects that were exciting 20 years ago, but are now outlived and overworked. Phantom Menace is short on story as well. It just doesn't have the same appeal as the original. The cast has its mix. Neeson and McGregor are effective as Jedi Knights, while Lloyd suffers horribly from the obvious clash in acting styles with the more able Neeson and McGregor. Portman is dull as Queen Amidala, but then again, Queen Amidala is dull. The rest of the characters lack the appeal and fun of the original players. Jar-Jar Binks has its moments, but his character seems more into the schtick and not into the major focus of the story. While I did not find the character annoying, I did find him quite pointless to the scope and theme of the film. Darth Maul was quite menacing to look at, so why wasn't he given any significant dialogue? He was quite imposing and added to the only exciting aspect of the film, a superb fight sequence that was obviously given much attention; too bad I cannot say that for the rest of the film. Wuth this return to Star Wars, one has to ask director Lucas this question: Why make this movie? Money? For the countless numbers of fans who sat up until and well past the midnight hour to get tickets to the opening show? Who knows? It will make money. Lots of money. All I'm saying is that if you're going to bring back the thrills from 20 years ago...do that! Bring back the thrills. Bring back the characters we love. Frankly, I could care less about the development of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. George? Get to the good stuff. You got two more films to go...don't disappoint.",0

I did remember why I loved Obi Wan and the beginning of his arc, and I was also re-angered by my wish that Maul receive the justice he deserves. I appreciate the political tension that soared over my head as a child, and knowing the full story helps me appreciate the subtleties Lucas indulged himself with as he made this trilogy.

The ""story line"" is so convoluted and confusing, and the characters come and go so fast you can't figure out who they are.

However watching it now, it isn't a super awful movie. But I enjoyed it as a kid, because it will appeal to mostly kids. With the cartoony direction, with hardly any depth or emotion to it. It had very choreographed lightsaber duels and stuff. And also included witless slapstick humor thrown in and even has one of the worst movie character, in movie history... ""Jar-Jar Binks"". I was blind to all the flaws of this movie when watching it as a kid. But seeing it now...Well it is a very corny movie. And I personally don't think George Lucas should work as a director. Sure, he came up with a imaginative space setting and characters with the ""A New Hope"". And I think he should have just stayed as the idea guy for the premise probably and not do the story and dialogue. Because I think ""A New Hope"" ended up being a fluke. George Lucas seems to have focused on the CGI aspect of the movie more than the actual story. And the CGI for this movie is pretty awful in today's standards. And all the main CGI scenes, besides the pod racing scene was awful because of Jar-Jar Binks. I think South Park had an episode about this creature about how annoying it is. The whole movie was just corny and silly. I could talk about everything that is wrong with this movie, but it would take forever. I will just say everything about this movie seemed robotic and I don't mean that in a good way. That includes the acting as well. I did however like the backstory when it came to the relationship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Although there isn't much development.

959,10.0,"This is Episode 1, the very first installment of the Star Wars saga, which finishes with Episode 6: Return of the Jedi. Released in May of 1999, this film was a box office smash and Star Wars fans had waited years for the release of the prequels. Jake Lloyd stars as the child Anakin Skywalker of the planet Tatooine, who meets up with Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) Jedi master and apprentice and Padme Amidala, Queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman. When I first saw this in 1999, I had no clue what was going on, especially in the first half hour or so. I am one of the many that dislike the character of Jar Jar Binks, who is in-you-face annoying, talks like a pre-Civil War black slave i.e. ""You- sah thinking your people dying ?"" or ""When sa you sa thinking' we'z in trouble"". The character of Jar Jar was Lucas being like Disney in efforst to get the little kids into Star Wars. Well, not even as a kid would I have enjoyed this character. Other than the disappointing Jar Jar, the film is the best in the series next to Empire and the newer Revenge of the Sith. The look of the film, visually and cinematic ally, is a miracle. Another disappoint for me, nonetheless, was the fact they used Yoda again as a puppet, as he was in Empire. He would later become a computer-generated character in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, since he fights in light saber duels. But here he is nothing more than a puppet sitting on a chair in the Jedi Council. Naboo, with its waterfalls, green pastures and Renaissance-style city is lovely to look at. The light saber duel with Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Won has to be the best in the series, a duel played against fatalistic Carmina Burana like chorus piece- Duel of the Fates. So many things to like about this movie. Natalie Portman (this is the first time I was introduced to the young actress) is a riot in her out-of-this world costumes, the Pod-Race between little Anakin and Sebulba is visually and technically perfect, even reminiscent of American Graffiti (also a Lucas project) or Ben-Hur. Liam Neesson is always great at every role he takes on and as Qui-Gon he is extraordinary.The plot is relatively simple: The Trade Federation, composed of greedy and corrupt aliens, make a deal with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious (later revealed to be the unassuming Senator Palpatine who gets his chance to become Supreme Chancellor in this film). Consequently, the planet Naboo is invaded by battle droids and it's up to Qui-Gon, Obi Won and even Anakin to save the day. The music by John Williams (who wrote the music for the other Star Wars films 1977-1983) is once again brilliant and whimsical as well as dramatic. Anakin's theme is melodic and innocent-sounding, while at the same time giving the impression that he yearns of space adventure. Who would have thought that this boy would become Darth Vader. But already we see how much he is attached to his mother, which later becomes part of his decline. The film is wonderful, and truly Star Wars fans will never tire of watching it time and again.",1

George Lucas seems to think that special effects are more important than plot and characters and while the special effects may look good, they drain all the life out of the movie.

The fact that so many very different races coexisted at all is too incredible to hope for. As for the choice of actors, I was quite pleased! The young Obi-Wan even sounded like the man he will become (Alec Guinness). Liam Neesom as Qui-Gon Jinn was my favorite! He is always my favorite! I absolutely love him. The queen was sophisticated and yet real - you could believe she was actually 14 years old at times. I thought the young actor who portrayed Anakin Skywalker did a marvelous job.

The reason for this was that the franchise needed a film to explain how the war began and the political structure of the galaxy before the events of episode 3. Despite the mundane storyline, the settings and planets they travel to are really stunning.<br /><br />While most people were unentertained by this and would rate it very low, I'm giving it a solid 9/10. This was the first star wars episode I watched as a kid, and it brings back so much nostalgia and happy memories for me.",0
987,7.0,"I remember first seeing this film when it came out in 1999. I was five years old then and I enjoyed. Over the years as I've become interested in film reviews and watched the film multiple times, I started the significant flaws of the movie particularly the dialogue. I understand there's a vocal crowd who passionately hate it, but I never could bring myself to doing so. I can't even dislike. I guess part of it is the nostalgia of the experience, but there's stuff to legitimately like in this movie. Some of the performances like Liam Neeson do a very decent job and while Ewan McGregor doesn't do much as Obi-Wan in this film, he gets better as the Prequels go on. The pod race I very much enjoy (though it could've been shot more interestingly) and the lightsaber duel at the film which saves it for many people is my 2nd favorite lightsaber duel in the film saga (first being the Luke/Vader duel in Empire). Admittedly many performances in the movie don't pan out too well like Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Though to be fair he was only 8 years old at the time he was in front of the camera and he got REALLY unnecessary hate after the it came out. In fact due to the hate he went through for his performance it forced him to retire from acting and hasn't been in front of the camera in over a decade. Kinda makes me wanna give the guy a hug for all the visceral hate he got over the years. Then there's the Midi-clorians; honesty I never had any negative opinion about them is I was never so picky with details in movies and pretty much just accept it as is. The one criticism I'd have (at least in Phantom Menace) is that they weren't explained enough. The Clone Wars TV series and the Darth Plagueis novel actually give a really interesting study on midi-clorians. I understand those who despise them feeling it ruins the mystery of the Force (a reason I suspect why J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy decided to completely exclude any mention of them in The Force Awakens), but it just never edged the wrong way. The Phantom Menace is 100% canon anyway and so are Midi-clorians so people who hate them will have to accept them. A huge mistake I feel Phantom Menace made was killing off Darth Maul (though The Clone Wars later retconed that bringing him back and is 100% canon). Ultimately I hold a lot of positive nostalgia for it even with its flaws. 6.7/10",1

This is great, I think and I like the original films too, but when The Phantom Menace rolled around, these fans were no longer youths, but adults instead. Just as the original films were aimed at a younger audience, so is The Phantom Menace and as such, the grown up fans were displeased. Yes, this is a silly, wild ride through the Star Wars realm, with annoying characters and tons of merchandising potential. But come on, so were the original three movies and while an argument could be made for Empire, A New Hope and Return of the Jedi are clearly aimed toward the younger folks. And while the fans ignore the countless plot holes and annoying characters in the original trilogy, they lambaste The Phantom Menace, simply because it wasn't ""how they remembered Star Wars to be,"" what a joke.

We are introduced to young Anakin Skywalker who will grow to become Darth Vader in the future trilogy. Liam Neeson arrives as a Jedi master who bids for young Anakin Skywalker's services. With him are Obi Wan Kenobi, the lifeless Queen Amidala, and the totally annoying Jar Jar Binks. What was George Lucas thinking when he introduced that duck billed moron into the franchise? The story is one blazing saber fight after another with several that occur within the first five minutes. Neeson is basically reciting what Alec Guinness did as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. The fact that this storyline occurs first doesn't take away the fact that Star Wars was made first. Ewan McGregor as Kenobi is there to fight and little else. Natalie Portman is generally a superb talent but here she is mannequin lifeless as Amidala, and her little smile in the conclusion is as corny as Jar Jar. Jake Lloyd overacts as Anakin and reduces the future Darth Vader to a snot nose brat. Ahmed Best has the prized realization that he played the pitiful Jar Jar Binks.

I can't believe I haven't, but since Star Wars has also been out for 35 years, I'm finally am! I'm starting with 1999's Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the first of the prequels and probably one of the most anticipated movies of the 20th Century. I can remember all the hype and advertisements like it was yesterday: Pepsi, Pizza Hut, and KFC Ads, Toy Commercials (still have all of them, action figures, podracers, lightsabers, you name it!), T-shirts, Lunchboxes, TV Spots that were shown just about every day, etc. I saw Episode I in theaters and being a 5 year old at the time, I was so blown away like some of you were when Episode IV: A New Hope came out! In this one, Qui-Gon-Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan-Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are secretly sent by the Supreme Chancellor to probe the mystery of the mysterious blockade that the Viceroy and the Trade Federation have over the planet of Naboo. While doing so, they'll meet and rescue the hilarious Gungan Jar Jar Binks, join forces with the Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) who is fighting to save her people, land in Tatooine where they meet Anakin Skywalker, who is unaware that he will eventually become Darth Vader, and Senator Palpatine (also known as Darth Sidious/The Evil Emperor) who is determined to become Supreme Chancellor. They will also encounter an enemy; the evil Sith Lord Darth Maul (who wields an amazing double-bladed lightsaber) whom they will have to face. Amidst what the cynics and critics say about Episode I, it did everything it was supposed to: remind us of how awesome Star Wars is and give fans new thrills! From hearing the hum of a lightsaber, introducing us to C-3PO and R2-D2, the awe-inspiring Rome-like feel of the Podracing scene, the epic 4 part climax featuring the Gungans battling the droids, the Naboo starfighters fighting to destroy the Trade Federation battleship like the X-Wing fighters did with the Death Star in Episode IV, the Queen battling the Viceroy, and the epic lightsaber duel we were longing for (which is my personal favorite in the series)!!! Let's also not forget the amazing score by John Williams! I think ""Duel of the Fates"" and ""Anakin's Theme"" is John Williams at his best!!! With all that being said, I can't wait to see Star Wars Episode I in 3-D! Just a little over a week left! Those scenes I just mentioned are likely going to be ten times better in 3-D!

Episode 1 is a prequel to the other Star Wars trilogy which is set 30 years before the events of A New Hope where audiences get to meet a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Jedi Knight and a gifted young boy named Anakin Skywalker who will eventually become the feared Dark Lord Of The Sith Darth Vader. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn (Obi-Wan's Master), Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Alec Guiness in the original), Natalie Portman as Queen Padme Amidala, and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine (The Emperor) and Ray Park as one of the villains Darth Maul make the best of their brief appearances in the movie. Ray Park does lack screen time, development, and dialogue but he makes for a solid villain as the evil Darth Maul. McDiarmid does a decent enough job with his small part as the deceitful Senator Palapatine also known as Darth Sidious and later the Emperor. Samuel L. Jackson shows up in a cameo as Jedi Knight Mace Windu who does a good job in his small role. Yoda the one Luke meets in the previous films also makes a brief appearance. The action/fight sequences are well executed but the two sequels that followed had more of them. The only two to stand out sort of was the climatic showdown with Obi Wan and Quinn Gon against Darth Maul and the pod race at Tatooine with Anakin. The special effects were cool but you can tell it's CG. The pacing between the action was a little slow at times making it drag and the dialogue wasn't the best at times either. The one character to weigh this film down for me was Jar Jar Binks. I found him annoying and the movie could've done without his character. Despite its flaws though Star Wars Episode 1 is decent maybe not the greatest but it does reveal some unanswered questions from the previous films which was interesting. Episode 1 is a somewhat entertaining sci adventure with intense action, some humor, character development, and solid performances by most of the cast that make the film enjoyable.",0
1014,3.0,"Now after one of the most epic trilogies of all time we have the prequel trilogy of Star Wars set around 50 years before a New Hope and showing how Anakin Skywalker would become Darth Vader, these films have polarising opinions and this is my review for the first one The Phantom Menace. The premise of the film sees two Jedi Knights sent to the planet Naboo in order to keep the peace, on their travels they come across a young Anakin Skywalker and new evil forces after them.",1
1015,7.0,"I've been watching the Star Wars films again starting from episode 4 and after watching episode 1 again last night i thoroughly enjoyed it! Yes, Anakins acting is horrible (especially Panaka) plus so many bad lines, but I still like George Lucas' vision. Darth Maul is a good villian even though he doesn't have many lines. He's just visually very intimidating.<br /><br />But that scene in the hangar where Darth Maul opens the door and lights up his double sided lightsaber, John William's Duel of the Fates starts playing; it's just an epic scene including the entire lightsaber fight between him and Qui Gon Jinn and Kenobi. I had goosebumps! You can tell the actors worked hard at the choreography and finesse of the fighting, unlike some of the digital somersaults in episode 2 & 3.",0

1017,7.0,"I've reviewed much of this film's coomentary and it never ceases to amaze me that non-professionals try to evaluate films like professional film critics. As a member of the movie-going public the only issue that matters to me is rather simply stated: Is a film worth spending the time and money to see. Is it fun, entertaining, or otherwise rewarding. Phantom Menace was certainly entertaining and fun and even interesting. That the film earned over a billion dollars gross income stringly suggests that an awful lot of folks agree with me.",0
1018,1.0,"I viewed this movie as kind of a 50 / 50 thing.  I liked the story and the characters but....  everything just looked so ""flat"" it severely lacked depth much like a video game.  It IS NOT a movie... it IS a video game.  I for one am getting very sick of all the C.G.I. junk out there, it just plain stinks.  I want to see real movies! I realize that obviously space movies need to use this element but in this case it is over-used.",0
1019,8.0,"Okay, this movie starts out automatically as a 7.0 simply because it is the Star Wars saga.  It loses 2 points for cuteness(3 points if you REALLY hated Ewoks) and picks up 2 points for great visual effects and the GREAT dueling scenes.  The story is a little flat and that heart pounding beginning we are used to from the Star Wars movies is missing but the plot leaves open some very intriguing possibilities for the next movie which gives it just enough appeal so that the movie was not disappointing.  Probably ranks evenly or just below Jedi when comparing the four movies (with Empire and the original being better).  Overall I would recommend the movie but be prepared to REALLY hate the Jar Jar character. Overall rating 7.5.",0
1020,10.0,"Well, I bought the movie ticket expecting to be impressed. I was MORE than impressed. I have so much more respect for the other Star Wars films. Lucas did a terrific job with keeping the film ""made 4 SW-fans"". Superb acting! Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor were so cool and Natalie Portman deserves some kind of award. Jara Jar was brilliantly funny and I take my hat off to Jake (aka Anakin). No faults (yes I voted a 10-excellent) ... except I thought it was too short! I swear I was only in my seat for half an hour.... and they should've had more of Mace Windu (Sam L. Jackson). Forget Austin Powers! GO SEE EPISODE 1. I'm going to see it again and again until it's off the circuit or on video! Oh and BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! ~ Luv ~",1

1026,9.0,"A movie on a par with the original -well done Lucas!  I was leery of the pre-release hype, of the dire last minute warnings, and the over-anticipation - it was for nothing!  Lucas has done a terrific job dealing with the characters, creating new ones and creating a sense of foreshadowing for what will follow.  Many things are explained, maybe too much, and yet the film seemed over before I sat down.  I think it will generate as much philosophical discussion as New Hope.  Jar Jar Binks wasn't as annoying as I anticipated, but there were times when I couldn't understand him.  His role is one of comic relief, and his presence seems purely superfluous. He could be easily replaced by anything, or cut completely.  Strong point - he seems to be there purely for commercial tie-ins - my kids love him, he's funny, I bought my son a shirt with him on it and he loves it.  He's the Ewoks all over again.",1
1027,7.0,This is an above average movie.  A lot of the reviews here seem to be emotional knee-jerk responses more than thoughtful comments.It does live up to decent-movie standards but it doesn't accomplish the nearly impossible task of living up to is it's hype.  I think this is why there are so many over-negative reviews.,0
1028,8.0,"Most people seem to dislike this film, and I'm not entirely sure why. I personally like all of the ""Star Wars"" movies, and though this is one of the lesser ones, it is still enjoyable and a well-made piece of an excellent saga. A few things seem to make people dislike this movie. One, apparently no one was expecting Anakin Skywalker to be a kid here, and though it isn't what we thought, it really doesn't affect the rest of the saga, and it shows how Anakin was influenced from an early age. Second, most people cannot stand Jar-Jar Binks. Personally, I like him, and I don't think he's any more annoying or unusual than any other comical characters from the rest of the saga (many characters from ""Return of the Jedi""). Third, Darth Maul. I might agree in this case. He is not a great villain, has no character, and is simply a disturbing person to look at. Fourth, the Podracing scenes. Though they are not essential to the plot, they are some of the most well-done scenes in the saga. They really do add to the movie. There may be other reasons people don't enjoy this film, but I've tried to justify the main ones. People seem to be missing many of this film's good points, such as Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson), one of the best characters in the entire saga, a brilliant and intelligent role as a Master Jedi. It's not a perfect film, I will agree. However, I love the dark, uncertain nature of this film, meant simply to set the stage for more great films in the saga. There are enough good points for me to enjoy the film. Not one of the best ""Star Wars"" movies, but definitely one of the most underrated ones.",1

1033,4.0,"Alright, it's all too easy to just rip the ass out of a movie like this, so I'm going to go ahead and let you know up front that I'll do my best to give this a fair review and point out anything that's good. Now then, let's discuss the plot; The film opens with two Jedi being send to ""mediate a trade dispute"" in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. In the process, the Trade Federation (the party that they were supposed to be meeting with), attempt to kill them, and as a result, the Jedi flee to the Planet Naboo below in time for the Trade Federation to launch an invasion of the Planet. In desperation, the Jedi unite with the Queen of Naboo, and flee the planet, bound initially for the Galactic Capital of Coruscant. In their escape attempt however, their spacecraft becomes damaged and they are forced to make an emergency landing on the remote Planet of Tatooine where they meet a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually helps them get off world and back to Coruscant. Once there, the Galactic Senate proves unable to help with the brewing crisis on Naboo from the Trade Federation Invasion and the Queen decides to return to Naboo herself to deal with the problem. The Jedi decide to return with her to get to the bottom of the situation and inform the Senate of the real motivations behind the Trade Federation invasion. In the process the Jedi become embroiled in a fierce Lightsaber duel with a supposedly extinct Sith Lord, Darth Maul. At the same time, the Queen leads the Royal Palace Guards to retake the palace and capture the leader of the Trade Federation. Also at the same time, the natives of the planet, the Gungans fight to try and eliminate the Trade Federation Army and little Anakin Skywalker leads the attack on the orbiting Trade Federation ships. In the end, one of the Jedi are killed in the fight with the Sith, the Queen retakes the palace, the Trade Federation ships are destroyed, and the Gungans triumph over the Army, and we're set up for the next one. OK, now if you're confused by that summary, then you are not alone. Never mind that that plot is incredibly complex, which wouldn't be a problem if the situations were better set up and the character motivations better explained, but it's just so convoluted.",0
1034,3.0,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a movie I'm apprehensive to review; perhaps more than any other film ever. I only review movies if I feel I have something to interesting and unique to say. What unique viewpoint to do I have to give to the Star Wars prequels? - possibly the three most heavily critiqued films ever. I decided to watch all three prequels again (and hopefully for the last time) in order to get a fresh perspective on them. I believe I may have some unique points of view to offer; plus I am among the populace who is addicted to discussing every aspect of George Lucas' pop culture behemoth.,1
1035,1.0,"My first viewing of this movie was like that of many Star Wars fans. I waited in the long lines to see it, I was so excited I was actually about to see a new Star Wars movie. When the iconic opening music filled the theater I could hardly contain my excitement and then the movie started. Almost immediately something felt wrong but I pushed it away, this was Star Wars, it had to be good. I maintained this denial the entire movie, one boring, awkward, bland scene after the next. When the end credits came I was so confused, ""did that just totally suck ass or is it just me""? ",0

THIS FILM ROCKS!!!I don't know what movie some of those critics were watching but the one I saw had me riveted from start to finish. Star Wars fans, international ones especially, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I sat in that theater literally with my jaw open at some of the sights Lucas puts up on the screen: Coruscant, with its skyline that extends over the whole planet, is like nothing you've ever seen before in the movies. Likewise the Senate chamber with its honeycomb-like interior. The lightsaber duels resemble nothing you've seen in previous SW films. Their intense pacing seems to draw from Hong Kong martial arts movies and they had the nearly capacity crowd cheering. I also have to admit I was hasty in my judgment of Jar Jar. He wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought he would be. I actually came to think he was kind of cute. He didn't detract from the film in anyway for me.",1

I can't much (or more like don't even want to) analyze this movie at this point... if ever. ;) This only begins the great story that goes on in the Star Wars films and that story is in nowhere near completion, so it's pointless to criticize this one particular flick when no one hasn't yet seen the whole story.

So this is the first of the new prequels leading to the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Lord Darth Vader. Basically Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Won Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are trying to restore some order in the galaxy after the villains have started a battle, because of taxation. Along the journey they help Queen Padmé Naberrie Amidala (Natalie Portman), meet 10-year-old Anakin (Razzie nominated Jake Lloyd) who wins a pod race for them to get money to fix their ship, have many political discussions both about the war and Anakin's future, and have a war with the Gungans, droid armies and fighter pilots. Also starring Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, The Muppets' Frank Oz (aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) as Yoda (still a puppet, till the next two), Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidius, Ray Park as Darth Maul, Razzie winning Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, Anthony Daniels as an uncovered C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Valorum, Brian Blessed as Boss Nass, Celia Imrie as Fighter Pilot Bravo 5, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Keira Knightley as Sabé and twice Razzie nominated Sofia Coppola as Saché. This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story, dialogue (which is ridiculous) or 'magic' as the originals, but the special effects are never disappointing. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay and Worst Screen Couple for Lloyd and Portman. Samuel L. Jackson was number 11, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Liam Neeson was number 15, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 28 on The Ultimate Film.

1046,5.0,"The phantom menace is by far, without a doubt, the worst star wars movie. The only good things were the music (duel of the fates in particular), the lightsaber fights and Darth Maul and Darth Sidious. Bad things, however, were not enough Darth Maul, WAY to many special effects, the podrace was too long, the dialogue was terrible, the acting (besides Neeson, Portman, McGregor and McDiarmid) is awful, and that midichlorian crap. Jar-Jar I'm not even going to mention, even though he gets annoying. ",0
1047,1.0,"Okay -- the effects were great and seamless, there was a cast of great actors, a great score, and an awesome marketing campaign.  So what happened? No plot, no story, no human interest at all!  I was bored and not engaged by anything other than the pretty pictures.  I did not cheer, I did not fear for anyone's safety, I did not care.  JAR JAR sounded worse than a teletubby, this was Star Wars brought to you by Barney.  Cute and harmless! Give me the old story about a simple farmboy, a sassy princess, a wisecracking smuggler and his dog!  And most of all -- don't ruin my dreams about the best villain ever created -- Darth Vader.  I don't want to know that he was a slave to a flying warthog, that he skipped around shouting ""yippee!"", or that he saved the day by accident.  I also don't want to know that the FORCE is a bunch of midichlorans in your cells, that takes all the fun out of it.  Some stories are better left untold.  The real PHANTOM MENACE is George Lucas.  He has lost sight of what made the movies great in the first place -- the spunk and plunk of the humans and the humans in robot costumes.  So you can make a 20 story fish eat a 40 story fish?  So you can make podracers travel at 300 mph before our eyes?  But can you make us care?  I did not care about anybody, and I can wait 20 years for the next installment.  Am I a killjoy?  I don't think the critics were HARD ENOUGH on this the most soulless movie since...well, I can't think of one.  And wrapped in such a handsome package to boot.  Amidala says ""Space is cold.""  Amen sister!",1
1048,1.0,"Just a big commercial for ILM. Interesting to note George Lucas's wife left him around the time of ROTJ. It also seems to be the point of George's ""selling out"". George has spent the subsequent years as a Mr. Mom to his adoptive children, which has emasculated him as a filmmaker.  He can't make any kind of cinematic decision without taking into consideration if it will harm ""the children"".   George changed the Greedo scene in Star Wars, one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, because it wasn't politically correct.  (George has also expressed displeasure at the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indy shoots the swordsman, another film classic.) A filmmaker cannot make a good movie by playing it safe.

The problem I believe is from the fact that George Lucas had all the rights to wheel and drive this movie how he pleases, that with no one questioning him, this I believe is the reason I had to deal with 2 hours or less of Jar Jar Binks, who wasn't funny but annoying and his clan was so annoying that I wished the droids wiped them out before young Anakin Skywalker could save them.",0

After my first viewing i thought it was guff, i thought george lucas was mad for casting ewan mcgregor as obi-one and i left the cinema an angry man. But i decided i owed it to my inner child to go watch the film again and focus on the good points. So i watched again and found it more enjoyable, its a pretty darn good film if you just ignore the stupid little boy and that jar jar binks, as for ewan; hes not so bad it was a hard role to pull off and he does an ok job, everyone expected too much of him. The things i found really good in this film were the amazing special effects, liam neeson's performance and darth maul (my god he is cool). So i would say that it is worth watching for anybody because it is a good film, but don't try and compare it to the originals because it is just far too different (well obviously apart from the over all story line). 8/10",1

Indeed an obvious gimmick used for comedic reference, but the problem is after the first few minutes of his insatiable babbling it becomes totally obnoxious. And apart from that, he contributes next to nothing to the entire movie, bar leading Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn to the underwater city of Otho Gunga. Other than that he is just a useless character who spends a majority of his time being beaten up by thugs, blasted by tanks, shot at by speeder bikes, nearly run over by transport craft and getting thrown from his own horse (or, duck like thing, I don't know...). If you exclude this ridiculous character, the film isn't all that bad, the story is very well written as it introduces many pivotal characters such as Obi Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and many other Jedi Master's of the original Trilogy such as Yoda, as well as giving a better background to where they came from.",0

They were simple, clear, and as effective as sci-fi fantasy can be.  Scenes rarely felt recycled, and they usually concluded taking a surprising twist you didn't expect.. i.e. Luke's defeat of the Rancor monster by closing the gate over him, Luke cutting off the front of a Speeder bike, sending the rider twirling about, etc.  We were entering worlds through the eyes of characters who were more or less fleshed out, and in every scene, there's was something clever.

Of coarse there are some flaws. Jar Jar Binks was a complete idiot and more corny than a comic relief. The storyline was mainly based off a trade dispute. Seriously? This is supposed to be a sci-fi movie, not an economics lesson. Also, if Darth Maul died, how did he end up in the movie Solo? Overall, a decent Star Wars film.

He's the only major character that doesn't say that in the first 3. I think everyone expected a rousing triumph like the first film, and when that wasn't delivered, some folks got disappointed. Hey, when the main character is a kid--have you ever worked with kids? (much as I love 'em) I know most of the original fan base liked it, but not everybody else...consider what's to come in the next 2...this one needed to be more farcical--quit trying to tilt it as a movie not as good as ""Star Wars"" and enjoy it for the wonderful escape that it is...this is one film I think will only be appreciated in retrospect. The scenery is jaw-dropping, Maul is fabulously scary, the Jedi light-sabre battles pale the original hand-to-hand combat scenes and the pod-race is exciting (Ben-Hur or no Ben-Hur). It's a fantastic movie--it's just not ""Star Wars"", but it's not supposed to be. 9/10.",1

George Lucas' direction is as rusty as C3PO on absinthe. The last notable film he made was The Adventures of Howard the Duck, which isn't exactly the best film ever made. Whats' so surprising about it though is just how dated it is next to the originals, and his attempts at spicing up the technology (double headed lightsabres) only contradicts the original trilogy as it is set BEFORE those times, not AFTER. A good idea would be to have Lucas hire a different director for the next two (which of course he's not) as he is so out of touch with modern film making its' embarrassing (Jar Jar Binks would even be unfunny in a bad 80s' sci-fi film) and the tackiness of the whole film means it looks more like an episode of Stargate or Babylon 5 than the classically constructed originals 3/10.",0

Too many special effects bombard the viewer from beginning ro end. Most of them are so over designed that they create not one sense of awe or wonder. The underwater city looks like a fish bowl ornament, the planet Coruscant looks too much like Fritz Lang's Metropolis and the spacecraft are just too uninspiring, especially when compared to the futuristic ones from the previous three episodes.The only good sequence in this mess is the podrace- a sort of rocket powered hot rod race. Taking place in and around a Roman style arena, this sequence obviously owes its debt to the chariot race from Ben Hur- yet even this lacks the excitement or majesty of the sequence it rips off. In all fairness to George Lucas, the Italian Reniassance inspired design of the planet Naboo ain't too bad. Other than that, this film is just a total waste of time.

1091,7.0,"Yeap, we all know the story about the famously infamous Episode I that disappointed people so much upon its release in 1999. And the BIG question #1 I've asked myself about this movie was how come George Lucas who used to be such a wonderful director back in the past with his first Star Wars film (that doesn't mean I liked it at all, but I still have no doubt that at THE TIME it was a very good movie) in the past, started disappointing us with his very first Star Wars Episode which explores the past of the original trilogy? What on earth happened to him? Was it a financial problem that lead the unsuccess of the first Episode, did he just somewhat stupidly forgot about the mistakes he did in his directing, or was it something else? Whatever it is, I'm sure Lucas didn't mean to disappoint fans around the world. It's not in his nature. But whatever happened that lead to the unsuccess of the movie, I would advice George Lucas to be more careful next time and to think harder when he makes a movie, to avoid any possible future misleads. The one most important thing people should know about this movie is that even if it is highly flawed, it is still a Star Wars film, which means that it still keeps you entertained! Despite its flaws, I liked Star Wars and gladly enough it offers a few of the best scenes in the entire Star Wars saga, like the wonderful technical construction of the underwater Gungan city (that includes the Gungan transport as well.), the astonishing and intense light saber battle against the villainous Darth Maul (along with equally astonishing stunts) near the end of the film and the exhilarating Pod Race on planet Tatooine, during the middle of the movie. These were few improvements, so a big hand of applause to George Lucas for not driving away from the original and exciting stuff! The special effects were very good also! I also became a huge fan of Darth Maul, because of his very good makeup. The first time I saw his face in the movie, I looked at his face for the first time, in awe! His face was so unbelievably devilish looking and that frightened me! Some people complained that there was not enough Darth Maul, but that's a complain I strongly disagree with because in my opinion, not seeing him enough during the entire movie made it feel more mysterious in terms of the Sith's mysterious return, the Sith that were thought to be extinct a millennium ago, and I think it is better this way for that very purpose. Another BIG question I've been asking myself about this movie was the following: what was Lucas' thoughts behind the Jar Jar Bink character? I've learned that this character was met with generally or mostly extreme negative criticism and that I'm not surprised. Fortunately, I found out why George Lucas added this frankly not funny Gungan plague. It was for comic relief, but that of course we all know it's obvious, but here is a more precise reason as to why this character was added. From what I've read, he wanted to added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief for people 12 years old or younger, so that might mean that it was never meant to apply to us teenagers and adults. What do you think? I felt Jar Jar was alright from time to time, but at times like almost everyone else my age I found him unfunny and annoying. When you hear 'Star Wars: EPISODE I' you hear EPISODE I which makes you feel and think that because it is the very first Episode of an entire legendary saga trilogy and that it connects with the amazing original trilogy, then it should really be a very good movie. That's exactly how I feel and think when thinking about this first episode and when I think of this sentence I feel very angry with George Lucas and disappointed that Phantom Menace was ruined. It could have been a blockbuster, but it's now miles away and a pity that you can't turn back the past and make this movie again. Have any of you guys reading this exactly felt and thought this way? Overall, Phantom Menace delivered on the friendly thrills we all want, but it lacks a full thematic richness and a narrative complexity. Despite the flaws, I spare Phantom Menace as an overall movie for all the other good things it managed to offer.",1

1102,1.0,"I waited with the most gleeful anticipation to see this movie, see I'm one of the million ""star wars fanatics"" out there.  I saw the movie.  I walked out of the theater wondering, ""what happened?""  It's as if the director/producer Mr. Lucas, never realized that the original trilogy was great not just because of the special effects, but because it was a great movie.  Compare Phantom Menace to the any one of the original Star Wars films.  In the original trilogy, there was a plot that always kept moving, always a reason to get to the next part of the film, always a level of suspense that kept the movie going.  Those movies never took 25 minutes out of the film for scenes with bland dialogue, super-cheesy acting, and no suspense, only to follow this monstrosity with a pod race which, though great in special fx, had NOTHING to do with the final outcome of the movie, the characters, or anything else that was thrown into this film. Another difference between the classic trilogy and the Phantom Menace: the conflict between good & evil.  During every major fight scene in the original trilogy, there was a level of personal character conflict between the characters (Luke finding out his relation to Darth Vader, Obi-wan Kenobi meeting his old adversary and former friend, etc).  This conflict was ALWAYS more important than the external light-saber fights.  In the Phantom Menace, all we have is a big choreographed, special fx-enhanced fight between characters who we know little about.  Why are they even fighting?  Good vs. Evil I guess, but there's no conflict.  ...and since when do they use Kung-Fu in Star Wars????  In the classic trilogy, it was always traditional medevil-style sword fighting, and now it's flip-kick-jump-do-a-twirly-thing-with-your-sword. Sure, it's kinda fun to watch, but it all boils down to a fight with NO REAL REASON FOR CONFLICT.    And then there's the humor...   Here we have Jar-jar Binks, a clumsily-walking, unintelligibly-talking, alien, who has NO personality, and spends all of his time flopping around acting stupid to make the little kids in the audience laugh.  In the original movies, all of the humor came from the characters and their personalities.  Example:  In Episode IV, we know that Han Solo is a somewhat laid-back, loner who seems to be only interested in money, and doesn't take orders from anyone. Princess Leia has already shown herself to be someone who is used to taking charge of a situation, and who can be sarcastic and serious at the same time.  When Han has to rescue her, there's a tremendous amount of personality conflict and witty little comebacks between the two of them. This is funny.  A five-year-old might miss the humor in the screenplay here, but it's funny.  Absolutely nowhere in the original trilogy did we have someone with no personality do dumb stuff to try to make us laugh. Also, in the original trilogy, the adventure was the key to the films success.  It was an epic adventure composed of characters who learn their destinies, and develop their relationships and personalities.  In the Phantom Menace, we know nothing about the characters personalities, because all they give us is a mish-mash of bland dialogue that doesn't develop any feelings, emotion, personality, or character whatsoever.    Phantom Menace also had little lines here & there about how bad gambling is, and how people should help eachother.  It's a good message, but it should have no place in this movie.  The first trilogy never dealt with moral issues.  It was beyond that.  In Phantom Menace, the good guys are 100% moral, and the bad guys are 100% evil.  In the classic trilogy, even most of the good guys had a darker-side;  Lando sold out his friends to Vader, only to make it up by rescuing them later.  Han and Chewie were both gamblers, and lived somewhat ""outside the law"".  These are heroes we can relate to, because they aren't these idealist, bland, boy-scout types we see in Phantom Menace.    Also lacking in Phantom menace are a few other key elements that made the original trilogy truly classic:  romance, a scene with suspense every 15 minutes, the characters' reaction to what happens, etc. All we have in Phantom Menace are incredible special effects.  It's not a classic.  It's just a light-show.  If you want plot, intrigue, character, personal conflict, and suspense, see the original trilogy on video, or buy a ticket for The Matrix.  If you've got little kids, take them to see Phantom Menace.  They'll probably like it. but as for those of us who really appreciate good movies, this is a disappointment.  The force was weak with this movie.  Try again, Mr. Lucas.",0

In fact, a bit too much of the plotting and imagery echoes the first (or fourth, if you prefer) installment of the series: the strongwilled, but endangered princess, the final attack on the enemy spaceship, the climactic gathering of the main characters as they are showered with kudos by a grateful society.  Indeed, the final scene is actually emblematic of some of the failure of this film.  In the original, since we were made to care for the main characters through their sharply drawn personalities and sophisticated wit, we left the film feeling exhilarated.  Here, since the characters (each of them acted with stodgy seriousness) have not registered deeply as likable and recognizably human compatriots in adventure, the scene falls flat, and we leave the theatre feeling strangely let down.  In addition, Darth Maul is completely ineffective and even inexplicable as the film's main villain. So, given all these flaws, what makes ""The Phantom Menace"" a relatively entertaining film?  Essentially, it is Lucas' ability to create such fantastic worlds and to respect the audience's ability to connect this story to the future tales with which we are already familiar.  The heavy reliance on exposition, which might sink another action film, actually lifts this one because we feel we are watching a puzzle slowly coming together and wait eagerly for the entire picture to emerge.  In addition, Lucas takes a dramatic risk by only hinting at the evil propensities hidden within the seemingly angelic boy we know will grow up to be Darth Vader - and these hints only come through the concerned statements of the Jedi masters around him, not through any of the statements, actions, or even mannerisms of the child himself.  This provides an arc to link this installment through the next two films to the fourth episode.  As to the special effects, many are extremely impressive (especially the pod race), but the space battles seem strangely bland and not much more technically advanced from the originals. In fact, for a movie with ""Star Wars"" in its title, this film takes place surprisingly little in space.  Moreover, it is not always unnoticeable when an effect is actually an effect.  Many of the CGI effects seem less seamless than say those in ""Jurassic Park"".  The photography also appears a bit blurrier and more washed out than one might expect.  All in all, ""The Phantom Menace"" probably will not hold up upon repeated viewings as well as most of the other installments do.  But, for its narrative thrust and its often dazzling special effects, this is a film worth seeing at least once.",1
1120,8.0,"Perhaps the most unfairly maligned film ever made, The Phantom Menace was more or less my entryway into Star Wars as a child. Sure, I had already seen the Original Trilogy, but the series as a whole didn't really grab me until I watched The Phantom Menace, which ended up being my favorite movie for the majority of my childhood years. I'm not alone in this though, I know many a person from my particular generation who have echoed similar sentiments about Phantom Menace specifically, which, if anything, indicates that the movie must have done something very right. Which, I would argue, it did. Out of all six Star Wars movies, none of them exceed Episode I as a sheer showcase of imaginative power. From the stunningly designed palaces of Naboo, to the undersea depths of Otoh Gunga to the mind-blowingly dense expanse of the Coruscant skyline, no Star Wars movie does better than Phantom in it's power to create jaw-droppingly, perfectly realized worlds and cultures. For what may be the first time in the series' history (with no offense intended towards the Original Trilogy), Lucas's universe feels like more than a colorful backdrop to blaster-slinging antics. It feels fully-realized here, functioning, purposeful. There's an added dimension of life that Phantom specifically created for Star Wars and the universe is forever better off for it.",1

I get it, I really do, people who remember the Original films as a child have fond memories as I do, I was Five in 1977. If these films were released in 1977, 1980 & 1983 instead of the Originals we would probably like them just as much?

I eagerly awaited 1999's ""Phantom Menace"", but it was a huge disappointment for me. Director/Writer George Lucas obviously intended this movie for children, and not for people my age.  The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, so Lucas probably feels he made the right decision.  However, I predict the final two sequels won't do as well financially unless Lucas concentrates more on a better story and tones down the special effects, which are wildly overdone in ""Phantom Menace"".

1130,10.0,"This movie fires on all cylinders and is Lucas at his finest. The visuals are beautiful -- from the stunning shot of the Gungan city to the spectacular podrace to the climactic lightsaber duel and space battle, this movie looks like it was made much later than 1999. The sound effects are equally magnificent (the podrace is a perfect example), and the soundtrack, headed by the epic Duel of the Fates and the beautiful Anakin's Theme, is one of John Williams' finest works. The performances are solid across the board, from Liam Neeson's wise yet supremely (over)confident portrayal of Qui-gon to Jake Lloyd's natural and underrated portrayal of the young Anakin Skywalker to Natalie Portman's portrayal of both the intentionally stilted Queen Amidala side and the more natural human side of Padme. The plot adds a new layer of complexity to Star Wars, with the oft-derided ""taxation of trade routes"" providing atmosphere and a surprisingly cogent and efficient political storyline that shows the dysfunction and corruption of the Republic without bogging the movie down in too much politics. The villains are wonderful, from the hilariously greedy Trade Federation to the menacing Darth Maul and Ian McDiarmid's stunningly slimy Senator-then-Chancellor Palpatine. Jar-Jar's comic relief is fine and much better than given credit for, and the secondary characters such as Watto and Sebulba are unique and memorable. Overall, Phantom Menace comes closer to the medieval fairytale style hinted at in ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" than any other Star Wars movie (with Jedi knights, a queen in danger, a ""squire"" in Anakin, etc) and has a unique, innocent charm punctuated with a hint of dread as the Sith plot begins to unfold. The worldbuilding is top-notch -- this movie introduces great new concepts such as midichlorians (which do NOT redefine the force but rather introduce an interesting side of it that gets further exploration in the Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith), the Trade Federation/galactic megacorporations, droid armies, the dysfunctional Galactic Senate, podracing, the Jedi Council, the Sith (at least in the movies), and more. The pacing is perfect, with the beginning starting off the Star Wars saga with a fast-paced bang before slowing down to introduce Anakin's character and build up to the podrace, then moving to a beautifully visualized and narratively engaging interlude on Coruscant before the electric, four-way conclusion. My only criticism of this movie would be the tonal whiplash of the conclusion -- the Jar-Jar scenes work fine as slapstick comedy on their own but are slightly jarring to watch in conjunction with the lightsaber duel -- but this has never been that big of a deal to me. The Phantom Menace is a unique, wonderful, engaging movie that wasn't afraid to redefine Star Wars for a new generation and deserves to be praised as a stunning achievement in space opera.",1

The newly found lovers of the Star Wars universe craved for more lightsaber duels and space flights, and Lucas himself decided to embark on another three-part journey that would answer some of the most fundamental questions raised from the originals. In doing so, he conceived an ill-fated seed, found in the sandy ruins of Tatooine, that was foreshadowed to grow into something greater. That seed is The Phantom Menace.

1142,7.0,"I think people are overly harsh concerning these movies. A lot of people complain about the use of CGI vs. modeling in the original trilogy, but this is a bunch of bull. If Lucas had the capability to use CGI in the first trilogy, he definitely would have used it. The only reason that he didn't use it was that he couldn't, so instead he spent an inordinate amount of time creating set pieces and large-scale miniatures of ships (Milennium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, Star Destroyers, the Death Star). This must have cost an absolute fortune, not to mention that the manpower effort to realize his visions must have been staggering. And while I agree that the use of models has allowed those movies to stand up to the test of time (I recently watched the trilogy on DVD for the first time in years), I still think there is a lot of good stuff in this installment. The CGI, even 6 years later, still looks as good as anything we have seen since. The concerns about jar-jar and the use of ""accidental"" actions helping to bring victory to the good guys? Hello, what about Return of the Jedi? Ewoks were easily as annoying as the gungans, and just as goofy in the battle on Endor. The acting - while Han Solo is undoubtedly one of the most charismatic anti-hero/hero characters in modern movies, people seem to forget that Luke was an extremely annoying character (especially in Ep. 4), and much of the other acting was not great (Alec Guiness excepted of course). I think Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L Jackson, and Liam Neeson more than constitute good acting for Episode I(Natalie Portman is pretty dull unfortunately). Set pieces. This movie has some unbelievable scenes in it, regardless of what its detractors say. The lightsaber finale blows away the originals completely both in choreography and sheer electricity. The pod racer scene is another excellent sequence, and considering that this movie is 6 years old it still looks great (and sounds even better). While I would not put these movies in the same class as the originals, I do think people are extremely hard on these movies because they try to compare them to the originals, which are absolute classics. This sort of relativism leads to unfair comparisons, which harm the votes. People were under the impression that these movies would be as life-changing as the first movies - but unfortunately, that time is past. STAR WARS - A NEW HOPE was essentially the first action movie to even attempt the sorts of things the movie displayed - it simply blew people away. Unfortunately, since then, we have seen numerous rip-offs which have steeled us against being blown away by SFX extravaganzas. For all its flaws, it is still an entertaining watch - 7 of 10.",0
1143,3.0,"The Phantom Menace was atrocious. It was a pain to sit through the duration of the movie which was just a little over 2 hours. George Lucas returned as the director previously having directed the first movie of Star Wars, i.e, A New Hope. He was simply not up to the task and made some terrible choices in this movie. There are certain creatures who are weirdly shaped and talk even more strangely and I won't even bother to look up to know what they are actually called. This was an unnecessary addition which did not help in moving the story forward and only managed to irritate the viewers. The reason for the long duration between the last Star Wars movie to the current one was because George Lucas didn't believe that the special effects technology had advanced enough to fulfill the vision that he had for this movie. There was nothing groundbreaking about the special effects. Frankly, the visual effects of the original trilogy was far more original and well-implemented than what they achieved in this movie. The acting was below par despite having a talented cast comprising of Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. The movie focuses on a young Anakin Skywalker as he is spotted by the Jedi Knights and is selected to be trained. ",0
1144,,"The plot is there.  Not as strong or engaging as Episodes 4-6 because it is primarily doing a lot of ""setting up"" for Episodes 2 & 3, but I think that most people will understand and accept this fact.  I think the current criticisms will fade somewhat in retrospect once Eps 2&3 come out.  It only relied a little upon your previous knowledge of the Star Wars mythos; I think the uninitiated will enjoy it just as much.  You Joseph Campbell fans out there looking for the same types of hero-myth cycle elements may have to wait for the other episodes, I think.  But there was one plot element setting you up (anakin's conception). Be prepared for some comedy relief elements that cater to the under-12 demographic (the Jar Jar Binks character and the race announcer(s) were silly, IMO). GREAT visuals, lots of good light saber play. Perhaps the strongest criticisms I have is that there were a couple of parts that felt too edited, like they were cut out for the sake of movie length or something- or underdeveloped.  It wasn't disjointed, necessarily, but seemed maybe a bit skimmed-over in parts (maybe it was just the script and directing).  Example: I thought Darth Maul could have been developed more. I'm sure we will see plenty more of the Sith in Ep.2&3, but I felt this character would have been able to play a bigger role in the overall plot (I expected as much, given that his face is all over the place!).  In fact, now that I am thinking about it, the difference between this and the other movies, and perhaps the source of some of the criticism, I think, is that there was not the clear definition of primary hero or primary villain (like Luke/Darth).  In fact, the best-developed character was Jar-Jar, whom I wanted to see least.   That makes it hard for many viewers (critics?) to swallow, as we are bred on this formula. Also, a sorta-scientific explanation was given about the nature of The Force, which took a little away from its mystic appeal, IMHO.",1

Only in 1993, after Lucas see what his friend Steven Spielberg succeeded in Jurassic Park, is that the director realized that the technology was enough that he could begin producing the last three chapters of his masterpiece.

The story is basically the Jedi have to stop a trade corporation from doing something to a peaceful planet by some means that are never explained to us.Let me just come out and say it: The movie doesn't make any sense. And the plot itself isn't exactly what you would call ""Interesting"" or ""Complex"" either. Like, why are we talking about trade routes in a Star 'Wars movie, who gives a crap? Like I understand that this has to lay the groundwork for the entire Star Wars saga, but that doesn't give it an excuse to be this boring. How is the acting? Not much better than the plot unfortunately. While Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do good in their roles (With what they're given to work with), everyone else in the movie is AWFUL! Jake Lloyd is awful, Natalie Portman is hollow, shallow, and just boring to listen to, and Jar Jar is annoying as hell. And speaking of Jar Jar: Why is he here? If you thought the Ewoks sucked... they still do, but Jar Jar is so much more annoying than those walking teddy bears ever were. He is clearly meant as comic relief, yet every joke he makes is the equivalent to a fart or crap joke. I don't find him racist, just annoying and by far one of the worst characters in cinematic history. However, I will say this about the movie: The action scenes are really cool (What few of them there are) and the film has really damn good visuals. Like, seriously I give massive props to the effects team, cause the film is pure eye candy. This was the Avatar before there was well... Avatar. And the action is crisp and easy to follow and honestly, really thrilling (With the exception of the podrace, which goes on way too long and is not all that interesting to watch). The duel at the end between Darth Maul and the two jedi is a true sight to behold. However, there is way too much going on at the end: You got the battle up in space, the battle between Dath Maul and the jedi, the queen attempting to infiltrate the palace, and the gungans fighting the droid army. The jedi duel should be in the movie, the infiltration should be in the movie, everything else should be cut out. And another problem with the end is they way they kill off Darth Maul, like it has no meaning cause we didn't even know who he was! At least with Boba Fett in Return of The Jedi we knew who he was and what he wanted, so despite his embarrassing death he remained badass, Darth Maul on the other hand goes out in the stupidest way possible, and we have no clue who he was or what he truly wanted?! Did he want revenge? Money? Power? We never find out.

I really loved how incredible the Battle droids looked and the epic ending leaves you with a sense of awe. Darth Maul is so cool too, a silent behemoth of power with two, count them two blades. Plus podracing is incredibly entertaining to emerge yourself in. Now the cons, the script isn't the greatest and the pacing of the movie is fairly slow. Some parts of the acting was a little spotty and can be confusing from time to time. I don't wish to look at the cons of this movie simply because it is Star Wars and it is something I have loved sense I was a kid but there are some that are just to distracting for words, hint hint.

The effects are incredible.  This movie is worth seeing ten times just to admire the effects.  As a fan of the films, I immediately related to all of the characters and was enthralled by the story the entire time.  I even cried a couple times.  The pod race scene is classic.  The duel between Maul and the two Jedi is great.  The final twenty minutes are so exciting. Yes, Jar-Jar is kind of annoying.  But I actually found him funny at times and I understand what he was saying a lot more the second time. Some of the dialogue seems a little off, but who cares.  The minor negatives are far, far outweighed by the positives.  Even if you are going to compare this movie to the others as far as humor and characters and everything, it still deserves at least three stars.  If you judge this on its own compared to all the other trash Hollywood puts out, it easily deserves four stars.  It is a very worthy Star Wars movie and does a great job setting us up for the next two, which will for sure be just as great.

1188,7.0,"Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace is a decent film at best. The acting is average, seemingly due to lacking conviction in what occurs, between the ridiculousness of many sequences and overall absence of true direction. Character development is highly under-developed for all, leaving most simply unlikable. Comedically the feature fails as well, generating dialogue that is highly cringeworthy and moments that trade well written and meaningful moments for laughs that never come to fruition. The plot certainly feels scripted at times, in addition to featuring various questionable creative decisions. Fortunately the scoring was spectacular and the visuals were decent, giving the audience some reason to lean into a few scenes. The conclusion does present a great emotional moment for the storyline's most appreciable characters, but without receiving a meaningful setup, there is no payoff. Within this mess, there is an actually decent premise that could have provided a wonderful origin story. This film landed far from great, though, which all Star Wars additions have the potential to be. Ultimately, the overall plot line was somewhat intriguing, yet faulted in its execution on an unforgivable level. This film is only worthwhile to set up the rest of the trilogy, in addition to the few truly exciting moments within.",0

Not that The Phantom Menace is a bad film, but it certainly isn't on the same leave as the Original Trilogy. For instance, there's too much exposition (too much dialogue and politics and little action). But ironically, this is to be expected. Whereas the Original Trilogy is about the Rebels who are continually evading the dreaded Empire (which brought a sense of danger everywhere they turned), this new film is about a government that's already in place where everyone has gone complacent. This makes for no sense of danger (everyone is new, the colors are vivid - compare that to the Original Trilogy where everything is faded and old) - in fact, the incident surrounding this film centers around a trade embargo on a wayward planet. Because the story is weak, the dialogue, acting, music (which is still great John Williams, just not on par with his Original Trilogy music), etc. all unfortunately suffer. There is also an over-reliance on CGI. All in all, a 6 out of 10.",0

The universe, the mood and the stuff really has to fit perfectly into the system know as George Lucas challenges both audience and crew to make a totally new Star Wars saga and experience.

Episode I is just the next in a line of effects extravaganzas, as opposed to a singular event like the original.

Both were put for the pre-teen audience, I know, but the fact is that they are unbearable for everybody else. There's no point to specify annoying parts of their roles, because they are annoying from beginning to end. A final remark: Why this was Episode I? They take so many things for granted! I was hoping for an Episode I where we see how the Jedi circle is formed etc. This was more like Episode III. So, not from a SW fan, go see it if you haven't yet, it's worth its money.

Visually it is as good if not better than the previous trilogy, the planet of Naboo is impressive. What really doesn't hold it up is that it doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie at times. Many people complain about Jar Jar Binks as the problem, that the film was made to cater to the kiddie crowd. In a way, I agree that Lucas consciously went for the younger ones here, which is fine, but the main character of Anakin fails to capture the audience as he should. The movie really belongs to Liam Neeson. as Qui Gon, he creates a character that we like and respect, much as we did with Alec Guiness as Obi Wan in the previous trilogy.

Then they saw the flick and the backlash was an epic one and rightfully so. In case and point, the cgi are ugly to put it polite, the majority of the characters are either racist stereotypes like Jar Jar Bing (curse to be!) ,boring like Padme Amidala or both and for the case of the Jedi council ,which is useless, I mean a PLANET is under foreign occupation by one of senate members and they just do nothing. Why? You are consider to be the protector of the Galaxit Rebuplic and you have the Force.

To add to that the battle of Naboo is a CGI mess,they tried to do again the battle of Endor, and we get a CGI mess and a boring (if that is possible) Space Battle, in Star Wars!!

I had no idea what the movies were all about so two years ago I decided to sit down and watch every single Star Wars movie just before the release of Episode IX. Until now I used to always think that Star Wars are all about fighting with lightsabers, shooting blasters and something something Luke I'm your father. But now that I have watched them all and learnt everything, I can finally review them. So here goes the first one.",1

1234,4.0,"As a true blue STAR WARS fan, I was expecting a superb story with top notch special effects. It seems I only got the ""special effects"" part, since the story is so confusing, it's pointless to try and decipher it. It's true that trying to top something like the original STAR WARS is next to impossible, but it CAN come quite close, as evidenced in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. George Lucas completely forgot that most Hardcore Star Wars fans are grown ups now and that we would have liked a bit more substance in the story, and I'd like to emphasize ""a bit"", because ultimately these movies are intended for younger audiences. By the same token, the story is so full of complicated mumbo jumbo (about a trade federation and about a conspiracy, etc, etc) that children won't fully grasp what the whole deal is. There is some terrible acting going on with some of the minor characters. Liam Neeson is good as Master Qui Gon and Ewan McGregor does good as the young Obi Wan Kenobi, but that's about the only ""good"" acting you'll see in the film. PHANTOM MENACE rises more questions than answers. Why did Ben Kenobi said in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, ""Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me"" when it's now obvious that he was instructed by Qui Gon?!?!?! Why does C3PO acts like he doesn't know OWEN LARS and the planet TATOOINE in ""Star Wars"", when we now know (through ""Phantom"" and ""Clones"") that he was PREVIOUSLY OWNED by him (Owen Lars) and that he was virtually BORN on TATOOINE?!?!? These minor contradictions have infuriated many a hardcore STAR WARS fan and it only goes to show that George Lucas and his collaborators weren't paying attention when writing the prequels. PHANTOM MENACE's saving grace are its formidable Special Effects and the obligatory light saber fight between Qui Gon, Kenobi and Sith Warrior Darth Maul. The so much hyped tatooine pod race isn't as breathtaking as the asteroid chase in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (and we're talking about a movie that is almost 20 years older!). All my complaining aside, PHANTOM MENACE is still a watchable and mildly entertaining STAR WARS movie, although I think George Lucas shamelessly aimed this movie at the younger audience (kids between 8 and 13 years old). I think he could have made a nice balance and he almost got it right with ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Let's hope Episode III packs the punch that this one lacked.",1
1235,7.0,"I was torn between a 6 and a 7 on this one. The visuals are stunning, but Jar Jar is annoying, but overall this was enjoyable. The CGI actually doesn't look that bad! Sure some of it looks super dorky but it was pretty fun and enjoyable to watch. Overall, 6.5/10",1

Neeson and McGregor are way cool, Portman is stern, but good, and Jake Lloyd is pretty cool in his abilities for his age. I especially liked Jar Jar Binks, even though some people found him annoying, I really liked him because he was lovable and funny, like R2-D2 and C-3PO. Truly, you do have to be a fan to see these as well, I own the trilogy and have watched each one this weekend to follow up again on the stories. I do feel that this movie was worth the wait, and we don't care what the critics think anyway. Us fans will see it no matter what, and I would love to see it again, but my advice is to see it more than once. The pod races is the coolest scene!

The film had so much hype behind it that many, many, many, many people were lined up to go see and was a huge deal due to the success of the previous Star Wars films.

The characters were forgettable, the plot ridiculous, and I *hate* movies where some Whiz Kid is the hero. My friend brought his 2 children, aged 4 and 5, which was good, since the entire movie was aimed toward them. Almost all of the special effects money went to creating aliens who were virtually unconnected to the plot. When the Jedi was killed near the end I thought, ""who cares"" since I couldn't even remember his NAME at that point. On the drive home, I realized that I couldn't name the alien with the big ears, or the Queen or Princess or whoever she was. And I had just seen the movie! If all of them had been killed, I would have just shrugged. The plot, along with the ridiculously bad writing and acting, made it impossible to care about them.

I just hope the b******s who gave us the Ewoks and Jar-Jar Binks will go and take a running jump. Sorry if I got carried away, but this is what that movie will do to you.

1251,5.0,"I actually consider my-self lucky enough to witness and experience the magic of the Star Waes saga as I was never really around when the original 3 films were made . But the funny thing is that George Lucas still some how managed to bring us a prequel trilogy to the original trilogy to set it all out and tell us how it all began . I had already read several other comments on this board that either liked it , hated it or just checked it out for the just the thrill of the movie . Either way there is no denying that the movie made a boat load full of money and sparked probably storms on its own across the internet community . First thing that I thought about was the way the film was approached , unlike the other other conventional 3 this one had a very different taste and feel to it which NO Star Wars fan can deny ! The CGI was out of this world and made out to be as realistic as they could be but what else would you expect ! The fight sequences were cool but the last one between Obi-Wan , Qui-Gonn and Maul was probably one of the best fights I have seen out of the Star Wars saga as well as any other movie . The film kept on pushing forwards although sometimes I felt it was rushed in a few places (come on George you got 2 other films to expand on .) I can understand why fans are also pretty annoyed with this one and a big reason for that was the action as it was pretty limited in this one (either it was crammed into one place and time or it was over before you knew it .). Another thing was the intergalactic federation with its tax policies and other various forms of politics which to some point kept me in as I do have a bit of a Keen interest in politics . The presence of the Sith were all so very little as they were mainly used in the background as a sub-plot which will thicken as the saga moves forward , and there was not enough of Darth Maul shown as any fan will point out his history which happens to be quite interesting and thusly he can stand out on his own but was suppressed to a very basic henchman and not the an appearance however credit due to Ray Park for the way he played the character . Another thing was the rather some what racist voice overs used to describe most of the other aliens i.e. Jar Jar Binks who obviously the bumbling black guy used for comic relief but was just not funny at all and yes he was very annoying ! The Federation owners who were made to sound like 2 yakaza cooperate gangsters . Jake Llyod who played the young Skywalker done a good job but even he had his moments . Its hard for me to give this film a hard mark as it is George Lucas's big return to the silver screen and some rust is to be expected after 15 years of exile but in the end I think George Lucas spent a little too much time on CGI , sets , pods etc and making this The Phantom Menace to be more fabric then flesh .",1

What made the original star wars films so appealing were great characters, great action, and great humor. They were simply great! But this one fails completely at everything. The characters never smile even once (except for that horribly forced smile on Amidala's face at the end), the story is boring and the action is unexciting. THE PHANTOM MENACE can't be called a bad movie, though. I guess it can be pretty good if you expect the worst or have never seen the star wars films.

Everyone who likes exciting sword fights and spectacular space battles, has to see this film.",1
1257,9.0,"The previous summer hyped up films were always a bit of a disappointment. GODZILLA was horrible, ARMAGEDDON was only o.k., LOST WORLD was different, INDEPENDENCE DAY was silly, TWISTER was sillier, and BATMAN FOREVER was just plain stupid. Not since the original JURASSIC PARK as finally a summer hyped up film worth it.  And it had to take the brilliance and genius of George Lucas to save the summer movies with his latest installment of the famous STAR WARS films, THE PHANTOM MENACE. I'm guessing that some people aren't liking this film because they are either, A.) expecting to see something phenomenal and different  or B.) the greatest movie of all time.  I for one wanted to see something entertaining. And thank god I got entertainment! First of all, don't expect THE PHANTOM MENACE to be a full blown action/adventure picture.  Like EPISODE IV, (the original STAR WARS to you and me) there wasn't much action.  It was more of a character and plot development film.  It took EMPIRE and JEDI to show the trilogy had plenty of action.  And I think George Lucas is going to have tons of action in EPISODES II & III. But we're talking about EPISODE I, and it's a very well done film. Lucas proves his imagination is still strong with the different planets and creatures.  Hs has some very spectacular action scenes, the pod race is a STAR TOURS style fun race, and the fight scene between Qun-Gon-Jin, Obi-Won, and Darth Maul is very tense and exciting!  By the way I forgot to mention that Darth Maul is one vicious S.O.B. Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, and Natlie Portman are all very good in their performances.  Yeah, they are kinda ""cardboard"" characters, but they try their hardest to make them real.  Jar-Jar Binks (the computer generated creature) is cute and funny (sometimes he's annoying).  And Jake Lloyd as Anakin is decent. However, sad to say, Lloyd is the flaw of the film.  I mean, Lloyd did a decent job playing Anakin, but he's too young!  Lucas should have a 15 or 16 year old play Anakin, not a 8 year old.  I can't believe an 8 year old boy, who hasn't gone through puberty yet, fall in love with a 16 year old beauty. That seemed a little unreal to me. Otherwise, is it worth the wait?  Is it as good as the other STAR WARS films?  Is it worth paying $7-$10 for?  Yes, yes, and yes.  It's well worth it.  It's not my personal favorite film of the year, but it comes close.  It is very entertaining, and that is all you should ask for.  I know some critics will say that they didn't like it, and they have that right.  I didn't like THE CRYING GAME, ENGLISH PATIENT, and USUAL SUSPECTS, and that's my American right.  Overall, EPISODE I is a delighful prequal to the classic trilogy, and I can't wait for 2002, for EPISODE II.  Is it a surprise that I give this film ***** (out of five)............. I guess not.  And I won't change my review in the future, I'm sticking with it.  DON'T MISS IT!!!!",0
1258,2.0,"Star Wars, the Phantom Menace had to be THE biggest let-down of the 1990's, if not the whole decade. For years, many Star Wars fans, like myself, awaited with baited breath for the return of the Force so we could learn what led to the demise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader. It starts with the Trade Federation placing an embargo on the planet, Naboo. Sent to negotiate are two Jedi Knights, Qui Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), and and young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor). The Trade Federation tries to kill them and they flee to the planet Naboo. There, they meet Jar Jar Binks who leads them to Princess Amidalla (Natalie Portman). They flee in her spaceship which is damaged and forced to land on a desert world, Tatooine. There, they meet a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is a slave and a great pod racer. After making a few bets, Qui Gon Jinn befriends the would- be Sith Lord and gets back to the capital world, Coruscant. He takes the boy because he has strong proclivities to the Force. There, the boys meets a CGI Yoda along with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and a rising political figure, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmind). He convinces Amidalla to propose a vote of no-confidence in the Chancellor so he can use political clout to help them. Once that is done, Amidalla, Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Anakin and an annoying Jar-Jar return to Naboo for a full conflict. This movie goes from bad to worse, to more worse, to even more worse, and even more worse. The movie suffers from poor characters, weak story, poor conflict, and uneven direction. First are the characters. There is no-one for movie audiences to identify with. The Jedi are larger than life and epic, having little to no faults. There is no doubt, no longing for adventure, no fear, and no personality. Jar Jar Binks is the only one with personality, but it is annoying, ripping off all the cheesy lines from Full House while sounding like Roger Rabbit. Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin has no doubt, no fear, and actually flies a fighter in a battle. The poor dialog adds to this malaise. The story, too, is weak. At age 10, I found it easy to track the story of A New Hope, but will kids track this one? I doubt it. A bigger drawback is that special effects take precedence over the story. Lucas, now with the help of computers, places so much into the scene it takes the focus off the characters and what they are doing (or talking). And within this story there is no conflict because not only can you not identify with any of the characters, but also you don't find any hatred for the bad guys. In fact, the Battle Droids are just as cheesy and comical as Jar Jar. Finally, there is uneven direction. Lucas is not a master director. As a story board artists, and as executive producer, he shines through. This is prevalent at the climatic battle when three stories are going on and it is hard to follow. The only thing I liked was the Jedi battle with the Sith, Darth Maul, who wields a double-edged light saber. That was cool, and fun to watch. The only problems, it last about five minutes in a movie that is 130 minutes. I made a point to see the movie again, thinking I had become too cynical. No. After that, I was convinced this was the misfire of a man who used to be able to tell a simple story.",0

Not only did this film take me back to my childhood where many fond memories lie, it also reminded me of just why Star Wars films are miles above the rest.  They are so entertaining, and imaginative, George Lucas has created an entirely different universe and made it real. The special effects in this one are better than its predecessors, but that is to be expected with the advancement of digital technology in the 1990's. The story line made sense as you can see how it will pan out until Episode IV, where it all began for many of us.  On its own it doesn't really gel too well, but it is meant to be part of the series and in the grand scheme of things it is a welcome edition to the Star Wars series.

1281,6.0,"After years of waiting, I enjoyed Episode I as much as I could. Lucas would have been better off bringing in a really good script writer to tighten the script, and a stellar sf director to direct. His forte was always in the vision and special effects, and in his first Star Wars film (Episode IV), he condensed all his best material, so it was not as much of a problem with him directing; but when you work with the leftovers, a more deft hand is needed at the reins.",0
1282,9.0,"I do love this movie. This movie actually confirmed my starwarsfanism, I love the old ones too, and I think that this one is very very good , although many people disagree. Of course is not like the old trilogy!...it is not supposed to be. This movie is made for this generation, it would have been silly to repeat the same format the other movies had 20 years later. Concerning the movie itself, I think the acting is very good FOR A STARWARS MOVIE, we have to realize that acting direction is not one of G. Lucas'es strongest points, but it doesn't suck at all (just check the quality of actors),although I do think there are  quite a lot of corny moments in this trilogy that are not necessary. About the story, we have to realize it's part of a saga and being the first sequel, it exposes the main players and situations. The special, visual effects and look are just amazing, revolutionary and very well done. That's concerning the movie,...and about what people don't like, for example Jar-Jar, we adult fans have to realize that this movie is for kids too, and kids need a funny, silly character to like. I mean,really, how different is Jar-Jar from 3PO of Ep IV? I just think that older fans that grew up with the classic trilogy feel too overprotective and do not realize that they were young impressionable kids , when they first watched star wars. I recommend trying to watch the new prequels with a little bit of kid mentality, understanding that they're not intended to be the same as the old ones and always remembering it is a Starwars movie after all.",1
1283,1.0,"When Lucas brings out a ""Smell-O-Vision"" version of Star Wars approx. in 2024 everybody will realize that this movie stinks. Before than, you can watch this p.o.s in 3D, Wow! It's the same disaster as is was 1999 except it has more ""depth"", at least concerning the pictures, not the plot of course. But if you show a really one-dimensional plot in 3D you don't give it more dimensions, you just multiply the misery three times.",0
1284,6.0,"When I was younger and watched every film in the Star Wars franchise I pretty much liked all of them including this one. While today I still hold the same opinion on most of them The Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones have fallen down majorly to me and this film in particular suffers the most from that in my mind. Like Attack of The Clones I don't think this is a bad film I just didn't think it was anything special but unlike that film I didn't find anything truly satisfying in this film. But there is still plenty of positives, for one the action sequences are all brilliant, all the lightsaber fights and space ship combat are all perfectly directed by George Lucas and in these scenes the film truly does entertain me. Darth Maul was also a fantastic antagonist, he was completely threatening, despite not saying much he left such an impression on anyone watching this film and is the most memorable thing ago this film for me. Another thing I liked about this movie was Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor they both had really good chemistry and it was nice to see a new interpretation of Obi Wan as a less experienced and more reckless character. But every thing else in this film just falls apart. The cripplingly slow pacing of this film lead to so many boring sequences that make this film unbearable to watch at times. While I liked the two protagonists the rest of cast had no development, backstory of anything unique to them. The senate scenes in particular are so bad, they have no real need to be in this film or at the very least could have been focused on less, it makes you forget that your watching a Star Wars film and more of a mediocre political thriller. Now I didn't personally think Jake Lloyd was that bad in this film I just think the writing for his character was the problem, we never got the impression that this child was as special as he had been made out to be and was honestly just an annoying character. This film also changes certain things from the original trilogy that just didn't need to be changed such as the explanation of The Force, this just makes the whole concept of it seem less magical and more dull and didn't belong in this film or any Star Wars film honestly. The last battle of this film is very muddled, the battle being split into three like it was the Return of The Jedi just didn't work as well for this film as the characters hadn't been as nearly well developed as they were in that movie. ",0
1285,9.0,"Welcome home. That's how I felt when I saw this movie. It was wonderful to become reacquainted with the series. I can't come up with a single objection to the movie. I can't say it blew me away (well, the special effects did), but it was as good as it could be short of that.",1
1286,,I've always thought of The Phantom Menace as an awful movie that does'nt work on any level. Not for kids and not for adults. And the acting is of course awful as well. But now all 6 movies have finally been released on Blu-ray and that is not a good thing for the prequels.,0

This is the movie that opens it all up. The visuals are amazing, the sound is unique, and with a deep story, impressive characters, everything blends together to create an unforgettable memory. Especially the production design, make-up and hairdo, are excellent. If there is a point that I am not satisfied with, it is probably that the filmmaking style is a bit old, so it is easy to appear a bit uncoordinated and unnatural segments, like when Qui Gon praised Obi wan, other than that the battles weren't too dramatic, no one was in danger, I mean the Battle of the Great Grass Plains was pretty boring, the Queen's raid too blah~ I don't mean the war of lightsabers because that part is so good. Anyway, even if you're not a fan of SW, I guess you'll find enough entertainment in the movie.",1

Jar Jar was not as bad as I was led to believe and Darth Maul was awesome.  The lack of development of the Darth Maul character is in fact my biggest criticism of the movie.  There was an opportunity to make him an all-time great villain, like Vader, but this was impossible because his role was limited only to action sequences. Still an 8 out of 10.",1

1294,,The much anticipated Episode One came out to backlash. I love this movie. The special effects and creativity are amazing. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson star as two Jedis who go to end a trade dispute between The galactic senate and the trade federation. They wind up on the invaded planet of Naboo. They run into the annoying but cool looking Jar Jar Binks. Binks would have been way more tolerable if he spoke in his own language. They go to the underwater Gunga City and save Bink's life. They go to the beautiful queen played by Natalie Portman.They then flee the planet from battle droids and wind up in a blockade. Their damaged ship lands on Tatooine and soon they meet the young Darth Vader. The elder Jedi sees that the force is strong with him and wants to take him to the Jedi Council. Anakin here is a slave who is affraid to leave his friends and mother behind. Yoda then senses fear in Anakin and refuses to train him. Other plots include Darth Sidius masterminding the problems and sending Darth Maul to bring the queen to him and destroy the Jedi. The galaxy politics and Queen Amidala putting her people's trust in Senator Palpatine. The eye candy is brilliant. The pod race is great as is every frame of visuals. The end lightsaber duel is fantastic. The only problems I had is that the Anakin character was too cheesey. The movie is way too light hearted but keep in mind that all the characters die except for Obi-Wan and Yoda. **** out of ****,1
1295,1.0,"I actually thought it was more like a ""Barney Goes to Space"" video.  It was targeted way too much towards the very young audience, which makes it easy to watch but just not fulfilling for an adult who believes ""cute"" belongs in Barney videos, not Sci-Fi movies.",1

Some not even seeing it. but through 23 years, everyone has surely seen at least the first 'Star Wars' once. If you haven't seen it, go out and but it.

They built it up so much that it could never, no matter how wonderful it was, meet their expectations. Not only this but it deviates too much from their beloved original trilogy for their tastes, and they see this as a bad thing, I see it as a good thing.",1

Also, the movie held that ""Star Wars"" kind of magic - irresistibly exciting and eventful.",1

Not a great film, but not as bad as the press made it out to be.",1
1302,2.0,"Episode I has my vote as one of the worst, if not the worst major hyped release of 1999.  It makes a mockery of Star Wars and gives a bad name to every actor in it.  Where does one begin?  Wooden, leaden acting from start to finish.  No emotional content anywhere.  Incredibly pointless special effects.  Extremely loud soundtrack.  Pointless fight scenes.  Stereotyped aliens (note the slights to Asians and Semites, among others).  The only redeeming aspects of this bomb are the incredible eye-popping special effects.  And yes, the costuming was very creative.  ""So What.""  I certainly hope this dog is only released as a pan-and-scan on VHS so others will avoid it.  It's a hive full of scum and villainy..or something like that.",0

1316,8.0,"Was star wars episode one really so bad? i actually enjoyed it. I have a little 9-year-old brother and it delights me to think that at least one little boy his age-in another galaxy or not-is not that horrible. Poor little Jake has suffered much criticism, i think he did a good job. After all, he was following a script and a young boy of nine can't be expected to be the best actor ever. Then there is Jar-Jar. i don't see why people don't like him so much. i think he is a fantastic character, though granted he is not my favourite. Yes, he is a little annoying at times, but some people seem to be incapable of using their imaginations! All the aliens in the star wars galaxy are different, unique. if they weren't it would be just plain boring. Star wars episode one was designed to introduce the characters of star wars... the famous Anakin and where he came from, the as yet unknown mother of Luke and Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan and what the Jedi were before things changed drastically. It also introduces the idea of the Sith. Darth Maul wasn't such a bad character... Can anyone imagine him talking more then he does? It wouldn't be right. Yes, it is sad how the tradition of Talking through crossed lightsabers is broken, but whats to be said? ""You are weak!"" ""So... are you the master, or the apprentice. The Jedi council will be really interested to know."" ""You will never defeat the Sith!"" No.... it wouldn't work, at least not for me. I loved the pod-racing. The sound they make as they round the bends, the aspect of danger that is portrayed, a little boy facing the odds with only the Force he doesn't even know. I was so excited when he won and Selbulba was defeated! Ahhhh... Padme. In the first prequel movie i think that she has got to be my favourite character, followed closely by Anakin. a fourteen year old queen, saving her world. i love that prospect. Brilliant. i am only 12, and i saw the original trilogy when i was little, it had been out for many, many years already. I also watched at that time episode one and two, but the years went by and i forgot it all.

The young Anakin Skywalker, instead of being a shy boy with a little dark sparkle is haughty and unbearable as the majority of children in the average '80s American comedy. But the worst thing Lucas did, the one that I (and millions of fan) can't forgive, it's the pseudo-scientific explanation of the Force as the result of a symbiotic organism living in the blood cells of the Jedi... No explanation was needed! The Force is simply a mystical power that pervades the universe and that's enough. Shame on you, George!",0

1329,5.0,This is a movie that can make you enjoy the two hours if you wish to relax but has limited in the scope and creativity. Few elements seemed to be logically inconsistent. The winning of Anakin in the Podrace after earlier failing to even complete the race; the killing of the sith at the hands of the Jedi as a sudden when once both were overpowered. Also Anakin destroying the entire mission in one go- these all seem to be superflous. <br /><br />There is a little attempt at creativity like the different characters and the storyline are somewhat interesting that take you into looking for the next parts. The training of Anakin would be worth watching.,0
1330,,"I never thought this was ever going to happen! Before I start I would recommend for those who have not seen this movie to skip this comment untill you see it. Then it's finally here. THE movie of all time. I'd sure like to see how Lucas could stand up with all the pressure. Those critics who rated down this movie probably did it with one reason. Not to be eaten up by all the hype around the movie. At first I didn't know what to think. ''Is this really what i've been waiting for''? Five minutes later I was all into it. I mean, what has Star Wars-fans to complain about? This is as good as it gets. Lucas has not added anything new, but lets be frank and honest about this, should he have? No, i really don't think so. This is was SW-fans been waiting for. The same feeling is there and the new effects are as stunning as the first films were back then. Williams music has never been this good. The eternal battle against good and evil. That is what Star Wars is all about! No-one ( specially not the fans ) need anything new. Anything out of the ordernal would be so un-Star Wars. Every character in this movie was geniously made and it really feels like it is alive. Although I must complain about the death of Darth Maul. It would be fun to see Qui-Gon Jin in Episode II, but he will probably appear there as some kind of ghost or something. But killing Darth Maul was not very smart. He was the key villain for gods sake! He hardley got to say anything before he got killed. Although the fight scene really was something! Darth Maul was so cool! Why couldn't he be in on Episode II. It would be better. Everybody did great and you could actually belive that Obi-Wan looked and acted like this as young. I even enjoyed Jar Jar Binks!!! One little miss only. When Qui Gon dies. Shouldn't Jedis disappear when they die? No complaints as a star wars-fan! Simpley the best movie of all time...for now. * * * * * out of * * * * *",1

1334,3.0,Just because you have the first 3 Star Wars movies does not mean that you need to purchase this piece of trash.  Lucas has lost his direction- he has no idea what made the first 3 films great.  He needs to understand that the script is 1000% more important than all the special effects in the world.,0
1335,,Though this movie doesn't live up to the hype there are definitely some good parts.  The pod race was ruled (despite the announcer and pointless shots of Jar Jar) and the final battle was incredible (except Darth Maul's death). Thing is Jar Jar was just embarrassing and a lot of it just wasn't as fun as the original and has continuity errors (Didn't Obi Wan said he met Anakin as a great pilot and not before he became one?).  The main flaw was the fact that these catered to little kids while the other films were great for all ages.  So this is a 50/50 review for which is leaning into the area of a negative review.,1

I'm mentioning it because I had severe asthma attacks and had to leave the theatre at some point, by the excitement and emotional attachment. Well, ultimately my parents pushed me into it. They were feeling also as kids and they were establishing a bridge of communication with their son compensating the gap between us, perhaps the world was finally taking a break, a deep breath from previous political disasters which like a wave reached all corners of the world. I deeply felt the 70s and the beginning of 80s were the best times of my life. There was hope, I felt it. ",1

What I love about Star Wars, both the old ones and new one, is the vivid immagination and effort George Lucas puts in this movie.

1340,5.0,I'll be blunt. This is not your father's Star Wars. Forget the hype for a moment and try to give the movie a chance. This film has something for almost everybody. Phantom Menace has three personalities. It has some fast paced action like Star Wars IV. It also has scenes that were really a Star Wars cartoon. And finally there is a long serious stretch that was more like Star Trek than Star Wars. And you know what? All of these different parts came together for me. Phantom is not great but good enough.,1
1341,1.0,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't go in with high expectations.  But it was B-A-D.  Bad dialogue, bad acting, no plot. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were wasted in this film, nothing the least bit interesting to say or do.  We've seen better light sabre fights in the other movies, and although Darth Maul's double-sabre was cool, it wasn't enough.  Jake Lloyd's sweet Anakin gave me cavities.  Jar Jar Binks was nothing but annoying.  I am a big Star Wars fan, but I know a bad movie when I see one.",0
1342,8.0,"Lets be honest.  This movie had really good special effects and the actors were not bad.  However, it can not hold a candle to Star Wars and I really expected something better.

1346,8.0,"An orgy of over-the-top special effects is the only reason to see this film if you're over the age of thirteen.  Every other element in the film left me disappointed.  The juvenile comedy, confusing story, poorly developed characters, and just plain goofiness (e.g. I kept waiting for Sam Jackson to go into some Pulp Fiction inspired lecture about the tyranny of men) really left me stunned.  The much talked about Jar Jar character was as annoying and silly as any adult can possibly imagine.",0
1347,,"Star Wars was better off as an unfinished symphony.  The superficial elements are back, but more clean and sterile, deliberately splashed with cold water at every turn, child-proof and suspense-free.  Cut-aways to Jar Jar's antics or race track yackers diffuse tension and focus.  Though broad strokes can't be changed at this late date (like setting the film on Alderaan instead of Naboo, which would have given something new about something known instead of changing the subject), there are some cuts that could easily be made to make the film sit more easily on a shelf beside the Original Trilogy (which I love).  Immediately after Jar Jar is met in the woods and the Jedi clear frame, the scene should be cut.  Then the further chatting, the trip to Gungan City, and EVERY UNDERWATER SCENE should be deleted.  We do not have to explain how they got to the Castle, because we do not know the geography of Naboo and we know the Jedi can run in a blur. Now the rescue of Amidala will play without the stress and animosity we have built up from sitting with unwelcome Jar Jar.  Strangely, his presence as a background player will not be annoying now.  The battle in orbit could be re-edited so that it includes Qui-Gon's discussion of Tatooine, so the choice is made under fire and not in a lull of quiet which typifies Episode One as it is.  Then have R2 make the vital repair, they zoom off, and we immediately have the commendation scene - which will play better here. There are still a few cuts here and there, and the green pasture battlefield under a pretty blue sky should be cut as much as possible - especially Jar Jar, so the power of the dual can resonate through without dramatic speed bumps.  The final scenes could be shuffled as well death, funeral, congratulations from Palpatine, then final parade.  With all the Special Edition wackiness going on, it would not be asking too much to change this film for its life on DVD.  The Jar-Jar outtakes can be kept separate, so they can be viewed out of context where they won't do as much damage.",0

Darth Maul gave the audience shivers from his visage alone, and Anakin Skywalker, brought a warmth to the audience, even though most of them know what he'll turn into. I had one problem with this movie. Jar Jar Binks, the amphibian Roger Rabbit-like creature was sometimes hard to understand with his accent at first, but eventually I got used to it. The Pod Racing scenes had everyone on the edges of their seats; and to make a long story short, I urge you all to see this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars, go see it. The special effects will blow you away.",0

1355,5.0,The first film in the prequel trilogy is good overall but has some flaws. On the good side of things it's cool to see Obi Wan being trained by Qui Gon as they both have great characters. Darth Maul is a really cool villain and the end fight scene is awesome! On the down side of things Anakin and Jar Jar are pretty annoying and distracting which really takes away from the movie.,1

My mind swam with the possibilities of what was to come, but I had to calm myself so that I didn't get my hopes to high. I didn't want to go in think this was to be the greatest thing ever and ruin it for myself. Luckily I didn't have to ruin it cause Lucas did a real good job of it himself.",1
1359,,"This film was absolutely boring and uninspiring. Lucas has lost all the charm of the original trilogy and ruined the whole series through this lazy film. Nothing of note happens in the film and the audience are left not caring about an of the characters in the same way they did about Darth Vader, Leia, Skywalker and Han Solo. Most of the film has the appearence of a cartoon due to the overused computer generated effects which are not very realistic at all. If the next two episodes are as dull as this then Lucas should be locked up for defacing the first three films. Lucas should be more proud of Howard the Duck because it is more exciting than this nonsense.",0
1360,,"Star Wars episodes 4 through 6 had one major advantage over The Phantom Menace; no one knew what was going to happen, and all 3 films are full of surprises. Now with this ""new"" trilogy of episodes 1 to 3, all Star Wars fans know already that Anakin Skywalker is going to turn to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader, that at some point he will have children with Padme his bride, and that these children will grow up to be Luke and Leia. The fun this time is in seeing how it happened, although of course many fans are not going to be pleased with the results. I remember the attacks on Empire Strikes Back, and more importantly Return of the Jedi, when they were first released. Yet now no Star Wars fan would deny that these are classics. Yoda, the Ewoks....these creations were scorned by just about everyone! So whilst Jar Jar Binks is an annoying creature, well he isn't that bad as everyone is suggesting.",1
1361,8.0,"While critics and purists alike were bashing Phantom Menace, real Star Wars fans like myself were jumping for joy as a new adventure in that galaxy far, far away hit the big screen. The film tells the story of the younger Obi-wan Kenobi and how he and his Master Qui-Gon discover a ten year old Anakin Skywalker. Ewan McGregor fits in Obi-wan's boots very nicely and Liam Neeson is perfect as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. But the real star here is Darth Maul, played by the extraordinary Ray Park. With his double-edged lightsaber, gravity-defying acrobatics, and wicked Sith tattoos, Maul clocks in as one of the baddest villains in the Star Wars universe. The handicap lightsaber fight near the end of the film is the best in the saga (although this might change with Episode III). And of course i have to mention John Williams amazing new score. Star Wars just wouldn't be the same without it's wonderful music.",1

1365,6.0,"After 16 years, the wait is over.  Seeing a new Star Wars movie in theaters is nothing less than a ""magical"" experience.  The overall story is excellent, leading up to the events of A New Hope with Palpatine's thirst for power shaping the events of things to come.  The main action sequences, such as the pod race and lightsaber duel, are fast-paced and exciting, maintaining the high consistency of thrills that the first three films pioneered.  Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) add respectability to the film as the main Jedi, and the other supporting actors such as Pernilla August, Anthony Daniels, Ian McDiarmid, and Sam Jackson help round out the cast of quality actors.  John Williams' score is excellent, adding new themes to the classic score, yet keeping continuity in the music.  What didn't particularly appeal to me was the humor.  Jar-Jar ranged from tolerable to annoying, and a lot of the movie's humor seemed, at times (and pardon the pun), forced.  The classic movies relied more on subtle humor such as facial expressions, one-lines and movements, whereas this film had a string of poop and fart jokes on Tatooine.  For that matter, I winced when Jar Jar was kicked between the legs (and not because it looked painful, but because it was unnecessary).  My other problem is that the characters and dialogue sometimes took a backseat to the numerous special effects in the film, making it lose some of its emotional impact that the first films were so rich in.  To me, Star Wars, has always been about the characters, not the worlds they visit.  Despite these few problems, The Phantom Menace has been one of the more entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and it only continues to fuel the Star Wars frenzy that will continue in the next two films.  This movie is only meant as a chapter in an epic.  It lays the groundwork for future events, and gives plenty of thrills along the way.  An enjoyable film.",1

However, I have seen this film called the worst film ever made- I thinks that is over stating it just a bit! This is not the worst film ever made, but Star Wars it isn't.

Things that I loved about this movie were: The mind boggling special effects; the spectacular action scenes; Jar Jar Binks' witty dialogue; excellent acting by Neeson, McGregor, Portman and Lloyd; the return of Yoda, C-3PO, R2-D2, Palpatine, and Jabba; the return to Tatooine, the stunning views of Naboo and Coruscant; the pod racing scene; the scene where Anakin stands before the Jedi Council; the space and the Gungan battle; the fight scene with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul; the emotional mixture you get at the end of the film. I think the reason critics didn't like this movie is that they don't sit through and just watch, they look for the flaws. I didn't see any that I thought could be held against the movie. This movie was definitely worthy of the title Star Wars. It was truly the movie of the year, or perhaps the decade, or century. Oh well you get the idea.

Other. Character. Obi wan also get very little screen time despite being such an important character.

Uncle George says that he doesn't care about the adult fans. Star Wars was always about the kids. Wrong. The first Star Wars appealed to adults as well as children. This new movie is aimed at children under 10. By making this movie as stupid and inane as possible, George has narrowed his potential repeat audience. And this also hurts the next two movies as well. People will say there is no way the movie could live up to the hype. They're wrong. There's a couple of scenes, like the senate hearings and the lightsaber dual, that shows us how good the movie could have been.

It sells out the legions of fans who have kept Star Wars alive for the last two decades and fails to provide an excuse for the lack of quality film-making. I won't even begin to discuss the numerous obvious rip-offs of other well known movies but if you missed the obvious thievery for Ben Hur you must be mindless.

The opening intrigue as Qui-gon and Obi-wan are betrayed is captivating. Their adventures are worthy of the last 3 Star Wars movies, but unfortunately Jar Jar stinks and the kid who plays Annakin cannot act--when he was on with Jay Leno he was great.

Maybe that's why I thought the movie dragged on.  For not seeing the original, I understood the plot well.  But the main reason I went to see this movie was the special effects.  They were terrific!  All of the droids were well done, and the underwater city, the battle scene, every special effect was done perfectly (if the movie had no special effects shots, it would be about 4 minutes long.)

If anything it introduces some of the characters we know and love but beyond that the story is pretty tame for such a supposed epic return to the greatest franchise of all. The performances aren't fantastic, the characters aren't very drawn out and it offers few heart-warming moments or characters as the original trilogy.

It is a funny, goodhearted movie, one that doesn't mind rooting for the good guys and cheering when they win.  The touches of the ""Dark Side"" are subtle -- the last speaking sequence of the movie, with Yoda speculating about the existence of other Sith lords, gives us the slightest shudder of apprehension, and makes us just the slightest bit upset that there are three years until the next installment.",1

1399,7.0,"After watching both trailers of Star War: The Phantom Menace, I was just as hyped as anyone else ready to see this movie. After leaving the theatre I was a little confused. Why was Jar Jar Binks the main attraction in this film? Taking up WAY TO MUCH MOVIE TIME!! The characters really never got a chance to grow on your because Jar Jar was in every damn scene. The interaction between Quon and Obi Wan's characters never clicked for me. Anakin and the princess had a better relationship and depth. Which is good since they will have kids in the future. The special effects, of course, was mind blowing. But the look of a movie is only 1/3 of what a movie needs to be successful. In the original Star Wars, their was lots of drama, humor, anticipation, chemistry with the actors/actresses and action that flowed. Star Wars:TPM seems to be missing a lot of this stuff. The film is definitely aim toward the kiddies, which is a bit confusing since the people who saw the original Star Wars (the true fans) are all in their late 20's and 30's now. The story isn't a terrible one, but it could have been a lot better. It's the dialogue that's bad. With Jar Jar trying to talk in a language we can understand and the rest of the characters going through the motions, the film fails in several areas. Thank the stars that the next Star Wars will be aimed toward the adults. It'll have a darker side to the story. I hope it gets an 'R' rating so we can actually see some bloodshed (Jar Jar Binks getting decapitated would be nice) and adult humor for a change. Not a total waste of film. If your a huge Star Wars fan, you'll have to seen it once. But after that, just wait for it to come to video. I had to sit through the film twice and that was enough for me.",0

I purposely I had found out next to nothing about it and had expectations neither high nor low. I loved the Star Wars movies as a kid, but they hadn't become a religion to me and it had been years since I had seen them. But I had good memories, you know, and at the beginning of Phantom Menace when the John Williams music started blasting and the ""Star Wars"" logo first flashed on screen, I got goosebumps because, amazingly, I was eight years old all over again. It was an awesome experience.",1

When I was young I liked jar jar but not I find him more annoying.",0
1402,6.0,"It is clear to me now, after viewing The Phantom Menace, that George Lucas has completely and utterly lost touch with the magic that made A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back so special.  I did not like Return of the Jedi, because it was oriented too much toward slapstick and general cuteness, and hoped that George Lucas would have gotten it out of his system by now. Not so.  The Phantom Menace is a shallow, special effects extravaganza without an ounce of spirit.  There is so little dramatic impact in this film that I could barely muster enough interest in what was going on to even care. Not that it mattered, really, because you could sleep through a quarter of this film without missing anything important.  There are way, way ,way too many scenes that exist simply to showcase alien creatures doing silly things. Return of the Jedi was criticized for lacking substance and being cartoonish for over a decade, yet Lucas didn't seem to pay attention. He should have. By the time the big duel takes place between Darth Maul and the two Jedi Knights, I had to really force myself to be emotionally involved.  Though the fight is quite impressive, maybe even dazzling, the characters weren't developed enough for me to care.  I am vehement in my disappointment, and will gladly share it with anyone who is going to see this empty spectacle. I hope this movie fails, though I know it won't, so George Lucas might finally get the point.",0

1408,6.0,"Star Wars fans had waited a very long time for the prequels to be made, in 1999 their wait was finally over. However, after watching Star Wars- The Phantom Menace, many fans were left angry and disappointed. Their main qualms with the film was the introduction of a CGI character going by the name of Jar-Jar Binks. The combination of an irritating voice, stupid appearance and adding nothing to the story made him a very unlikable character. He was just an unwanted burden thrust onto the other characters and fans alike, he is easily George Lucas' worst creation to date. However, there is some positive points to take from this film. Such names as Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor come to mind, their acting performances helped towards saving the first of the three prequels. Plus, director George Lucas must be praised for the very good fight scenes and the exhilarating pod race. In conclusion, for me it didn't live up to the very high expectations set by the original films, but overall it is a quite enjoyable watch.",0

Some scenes stick out to me as very enjoyable though; The PodRacing Scene and The Final Battle/Qui-Gon's death scene in particular. I love Darth Maul, he is very mysterious and has a good presence on screen, making him my favorite character, but Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are a good duo and fun to watch as well.

In general, they didn't make such a bad effort, although the sequencing in later years will definitely look a bit strange.",1
1416,6.0,"I AM A STAR WARS FAN. I had high expectations for this movie, really high expectations. Ever since I saw the original Star Wars trilogy, I have been dreaming for a sequel(or a prequel, or whatever). I never tough the day would come where I would see proofs that there would be a new Star Wars but I kept hoping for it. One day, I saw the words ""Episode 1 casting announced"" on the cover of my Star Wars Insider! It was an incredibly good moment for me. You should have seen entering the movie theatre on May 19, 1999... I was out of control! I came in there believing I would be blown away... I came out of there really, really, really disappointed. God knows I tried to like that movie(I have seen it 4 times!), but every time time I came out of the theater, I felt disappointed. Okay, now lets get to the qualities and problems of this Star Wars. Let's start with the good...First of all it's a Star Wars(although sometimes I ask myself if it really is). The movie is beautiful from a visual point of view. The special effects are great and some action scenes, like the podrace and the Jedi combats, are great. I would even say that some of the characters were okay, like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. The music is great(thank you, John Williams). Now let's see the problems... Here we go! First thing, let's just say that Jar-Jar Binks is horrible. He is so annoying and every last one of his line is absolutely ridiculous and useless. Some characters were poorly introduced: R2-D2, C-3PO, Jar-Jar and... Anakin! This boy is the whole point of the movie and he is poorly introduced! Jake Lloyd really has a terrible character to play and he doesn't help it! Anakin is so annoying as the ""little boy that wins by accident and luck and never needs to do anything to be the best"" that most of his scenes are boring, particularly in scenes with his mother. These scenes are absolutely unbelievably fake. Talking about the ""point of this movie"", it almost has none. It's an introduction to universe we already know! It almost feels like a movie for people who have never seen Star Wars!Let me tell you one thing, not many people fall in that category. The plot looks like the one of the weakest episode in the original  trilogy: Return of the Jedi. Talking about Return, those stupid Gungans are even worse than the Ewoks!!! ",0
1417,7.0,"In 1977 audiences were hugely impressed by ""Star Wars"", three years later ""The Empire Strikes Back"" solidified that success, and three more years later, ""Return of The Jedi"" beautifully concluded the story. Many years later things were altered or added to the three old movies, some were improvements, others were damaging. Finally, in 1999 another movie was released, the beginning of a new trilogy. Only it wasn't a continuation of the well-known tale, rather, it was a precursor to it. Apparently, this cinematic story was too ambitious to have been told earlier.",1
1418,10.0,"When I see this movie again I will make a better and longer review for it. I went to the premiere showing of this movie. The movie was great wild ride. The Special Effects were better then anything before. The Computer Generated characters actually looked convincing unlike the earlier attempts. The ships were computer generated just like in Babylon 5 but done well enough that it looks like the technology used before. (Models) With the computer technology of today George Lucas can imaginative and breath taking worlds, some thing he could not do as well in the original trilogy. The story follows two Jedi warriors and their discovery of Anakin Skywalker. In addition to getting Queen Amidala to a planet that is one large city. So she can talk to the Senate about the Trade Federation's invasion of her world. I don't want to tell too much because I have a habit of saying too much. I didn't find Jar Jar Binks to be as annoying as everyone else claims because I actually found his jokes and mishaps to be funny. Darth Maul didn't have the commanding presence of Darth Vader but he sure did look demoniac and cool. They should have given him more screen time. The movie is entertaining, imaginative, fun and worth the full price. The Original Trilogy is still the best, this movie doesn't quite manage to bet Episode 4-6, they did have better and more exciting plots, despite the fact the special effects in Episode 1 are far better.",1
1419,6.0,"Even the people who are disappointed by this movie are already getting their hopes up that the next segment will be better since Episode 1 is ""setting up the rest of the story"". I'm not so convinced that there's much of a story to tell since we already know how it ends. The challenge that faced Lucas in bringing the prequels to the screen is to surprise us with stories and characters for which we were not prepared and at the same time bring us up to the point of Star Wars A New Hope (#4). Lucas's story here is quite simply lazy. There is no real conflict here to care about and the characters don't have enough personality to keep us interested. What makes people think the next segment will be any different? If they already know what's going to happen, then Lucas again faces the challenge of coming up with something new and surprising to offset the predictability. People defend the new film's lack of well-developed characters by saying the original trilogy's strong suit wasn't in its well-defined characters either, but I disagree. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2, C3P0 and the rest are firmly embedded in fan's memories while I doubt in 17 years anyone will be talking about Qui Jon (?) and Jar Jar Binks. It was such a wasted opportunity to have the likes of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neesan and not give them some kind of discernable personality.",0
1420,6.0,"In 1999, George Lucas' STAR WARS: EPISODE I--THE PHANTOM MENACE was arguably the most widely anticipated movie of its year. Hot on the heels of the massively successful STAR WARS trilogy which began back in 1977 and wrapped up in 1983, the public was hungry for more adventures in that ""galaxy far, far away"" audiences fell in love with. So much so, that expectations were high - perhaps TOO high with some people. To the point that when the film finally debuted on May 19, audiences and critics were sharply divided with the results. Although there were audiences who were thrilled to have another STAR WARS adventure, many, many others were crushed with disappointment, to the point that THE PHANTOM MENACE, despite being a massive box office success, became not only one of the most widely maligned movies in the franchise, but one of the most hated films ever. Indeed, it was hard to encounter a genuine fan of the first entry in Lucas' prequel trilogy, if at all. Stripped of all the brouhaha that surrounded the movie and its reputation in a revered legacy, is THE PHANTOM MENACE really as wretched as made out to be? No. But neither does it live up to the famous trilogy that so many people gravitated towards. The faults many have found with it are a lot more glaringly obvious, especially in the light of the newer, arguably better produced STAR WARS movies in recent years.",0
1421,6.0,"When word came out that George Lucas would be making the three prequels to his STAR WARS trilogy, word-of-mouth was roused, and so was the hype and advertising. The year 1999 saw the release of the first of these prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE. But even though it was the biggest moneymaker of its year, the film has split STAR WARS fans and critics of every kind alike. While some critics and fans jumped out in favor, a majority of others attacked it savagely and condemned it as a disgrace to the franchise. Even to this day, THE PHANTOM MENACE is mentioned with growls of disgust and/or disappointment. Almost everywhere I go there are many who take turns slam-dunking this movie and badmouthing George Lucas.",0
1422,6.0,"Watching the older movies, I found it incredible that ""Phantom Menace"" could be so bland, a result of featureless characters, an uninvolving story and excessive use of CGI special effects that never mesh with the story, but threaten to override it. So overdone are the effects, that watching this movie reminded me less of the first trilogy than of ""Cool World"", Bakshi's misfire mix of live-action and animation. In this entry, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor), only a student Jedi, travels with his teacher to the planet Naboo on a mission of mercy. Jedi Qui-Gonn Jin is older and wiser than Kenobi, but both are dispatched to prevent the invasion of idyllic Naboo by the droid armies of the trade federation. When this fails, the two save that planet's leader, the elected Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), and retreat to the safety of Corsuscant, the home of galactic senate. Heavy damage forces them to make an unscheduled stop on arid Tatooine, where they enlist the aid of a young Aankin Skywalker, a boy slave with the potential to become a Jedi master. Safely reaching Coruscant, Amidala finds only bureaucratic indifference to her world's plight. Returning to Naboo to lead the fight against the federation, Amidala and the Jedi's enlist the aid of the Gungans, amphibians who live in large cities secreted in Naboo's oceans. While the naboo battle the federation on the ground and in space, and Amidala leads a desperate charge directly into her occupied capital, the Jedis are forced to confront an evil Jedi, an emissary of the long-thought-dead order of the sith Jedi and closer to the power behind the federation than the craven Federation viceroys. Actually, the plot doesn't sound half-bad, if that's enough after a 16 year wait. Less generous might compare it to a mediocre add-on level for the Star Wars computer game, Jedi Knight. The characters are incredibly one-note in comparison with the heroes of the older films. Even the Jedi seem interchangeable with Obi Wan seeming as effortless in his moves as Qui-Gon. The older Jedi is also pretty monochrome considering the dialogue hinting at a rebellious streak (he clashes often with the Jedi counsel). The characters themselves speak in hushed tones and drop names that are familiar to Star Wars fans but will probably baffle anybody else. There's no rebelliousness to any of the characters - where's Han Solo in all of this? The controversies of the alien characters' very human ethnic traits probably wouldn't have come to the for if the human characters themselves had enough character of their own and embodied some of those negative traits themselves. In the older films, we probably wouldn't have noticed the orientalisms of the greedy Watoo or the craven Federation honchos, or minded the comic relief of Jar Jar Binks. Hey everybody's an idiot, everybody makes mistakes, that was what the first trilogy seemed to say. And there's no menace either. Darth Maul is no Darth Vader (though his moves would put the latter evil lord to shame, a true dark lord seldom needs to prove that), and certainly he gets no fun lines (""apology accepted....) The underlying evil is the mysterious Darth Sidious who appears mostly in the form of a hologram beamed to the federation viceroys. But Sidious (whose probably isn't sufficiently mysterious for true star wars fans) doesn't seek to cow his minions either. He issues commands which the viceroys would probably have issued anyway. And there's none of the irony of the first films which here should centre around the manoeuvrings of Senator Palpatine. That name enough lets fans know what's going on, but his insistence that political circumstances require drastic changes should be enough to set off anybody's warning bells no matter how apparently benign his intentions. Instead, the characters all seem so dim, why bother worrying. In one telling scene at the end of the film, the senator - now the Chancellor - meets Anakin Skywalker for the first time. We'll be looking at your progress quite closely, the smiling galactic power holder says. Because I'm such a Star Wars fan, I've pretty much got to do the same with the other films. Perhaps ""Phantom Menace"" had to be a botch, something to teach Lucasfilm how not to do a Star Wars film, a learning experience like THX-1138. Hey, there's plenty of time to get things right before Memorial Day Weekend of 2002.",0

I have to say that EPISODE I was a good film.  GOOD, but not great. The special effects this time were awesome, especially considering that the ones in the first film were done without any computer-generated images and in fact puts many of those to shame.  The effects in EPISODE I really stand out, particularly in the way that the live-action actors interact with their computer-generated ""co-stars"".  The story is quite good as we now know the relationships between some characters that were shown in the original trilogy.  I didn't find the character of Jar Jar Binks to be a racial stereotype in anyway.  Many people have compared him to Stepin Fetchit, this couldn't be further form the truth.  If anything, Jar Jar recalls some of the clowns from the silent film era.  However, I will say that a little bit of Binks DOES go a long way. Now, for the negative things:  I thought that some of the dialogue went on WAY too long.  Whatever happened to ""show . . . don't tell""?  For all of the build-up given new villain, Darth Maul, he had very little screen time as well as dialogue.  I was also surprised to see that two of the new characters, and the most interesting ones at that, get killed here (You'll have to see the movie to find out which two.  Sorry!).

Though Ewan McGregor has the voice of Alec Guinness down pat, he is not given much to do until late in the movie. Natalie Portman does the best she can, but feels like more of a display for elaborate costumes than anything, and her relationship with Anakin feels very forced from the moment they meet. Jake Lloyd seems to do a better job interacting with the CGI character Watto than he does with any of his human counterparts, and is introduced surprisingly far into the movie. Liam Neeson is the only actor that commands respect, displaying the charisma needed to carry the picture. Unfortunately, it seems most of the time is spent on non-human characters, including WAY too much screen time for Jar Jar Binks, the CGI slapstick comic relief (whose speaking voice borders on unintelligible). Unfortunately Darth Maul is not in the film enough to warrant his large place on the film's poster, nor the prerelease fan base he has already acquired. He remains too much of an enigma, uttering only a mere handful of lines. However, he does make his presence felt in an epic lightsaber battle that makes the fights of the previous films feel as if they are in slow motion by comparison. Though the duel lacks most of the emotional and psychological aspects of the previous films' fights (due to the lack of any sort of dialogue), it becomes almost unbearably tense, and deserves an Oscar for the choreography of the fight movements alone.",0

(And IV, V, and VI) No they only liked it because they didn't know any better! They were kids they were stupid! It had no storyline! Granted, I have seen Red Letter Media and many others and I actually agree with their points. But there's one thing I would like to say to them. Episode I influenced me to be a writer. It can be told as a short story actually. I would run around with my toy lightsaber pretending to beat up battle droids and my mother would ask me, ""Jimmy, do you want to be a Jedi when you grow up?"" and I said, ""No, Mommy, I want to be the guy that writes the stories."" I'd learn new things and words from my mother explaining what was going on. The simple beginning where they just dash through the droids, the pod race was a favorite, as was the epic dual at the end. The sad truth is that you don't feel that way once you're older. You notice flaws and become more aware of the story. Look at it this way, every generation has their own thing. You had the original Star Wars, your fathers had the old westerns, their fathers had classic literature. The generation before doesn't get or like the next one. The reality is that they're all stories. Whichever one influenced you doesn't matter cause all good ideas come from somewhere. I was four years old when I said that I wanted to write. I'm eighteen now and that hope has never for a single moment left me. Cherish that, George Lucas.",1

The use of CGI is distracting especially is Jar Jar and his character is obnoxious. Alot of characters are obnoxious. Alot of the dialogue feels 'forced' hehe. But there is no real joy in this movie. There are moments that do shine (pod races, final battle, music) but overall this movie is just sort of lame. Watch this next to Rogue One and you will see this movie is not good. In fact I think it's the worst Star Wars movie ever. What a bad way to start an epic saga.",0
1446,,George Lucas truly outdid himself with this film special effects wise anyway. The story was true to Star Wars form keeping the tradition of the original three while adding the special effects which made it a great movie. I also have to give Mr. Lucas credit for the actors and actresses he choose for the movie Liam Neilson was great as the semi-rebel Jedi who always argued against the council rules and Ewan Mcgregor was the perfect choice for Obi-Wan. I don't know how Mr.Lucas found such a perfect kid to play Anakin but it will be interesting to see how he turns such an angelic boy to the dark side.  My favorite character has to be Darth Maul though he is the best bad guy I've seen in years and he fights as a Sith apprentice should His weapon is just incredible and the way he moves so gracefully is amazing. Some people may say they were disappointed I cannot see how maybe your expectations were too high? The only downfall was the annoying alien Bin he should have had a smaller role(he is no Chewbacca) but he was funny in some instances.  My thanks to George Lucas for continuing the Legend with such style I for one cannot wait for the next installation.,1

The time i saw it in the theatere, i was bombarded with bad critic reviews, hearing more bad than good. I was expecting it to be bad. After viewing it in the cenima, i thought it was bad becuse i was told bad. After viewing it a second time last week with more knowlege about the star wars universe, i realized that the Phantom Menace wasnt all that bad. Good special effects, good story, good plot....the list goes on. Sure there might be a few annoying one-liners here and there but you get use to them. As for Jar Jar, he wasn't all that bad either the second time viewing. People hated him because they were told to hate him by much of the media. Give Lucas a break, it's been almost 20 years since he last made a star wars film. Let him get his  magic touch back.It's about one week from the next installment (Attack of the Clones) and i'm really excited with high expectations............Why isn't episode IV,V, or VI on DVD yet??",0

My father who did see the original 3 in the 70s and 80s loved the movies also and as I did loved the remastered movies. He is not what I would call a star wars fan boy by any means of the word, but I consider myself a fan boy and the impact that it had on my father (average movie goer) was very successful. When The Phatom Menace came out I was excited and at the end I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED. I am very tired of people saying that Lucas is bad and should give up, that his movies are bad are you serious? As a story goes it does not reach that of the original but the story that is depicted not only in the phantom menace but in the others are extremely solid. I feel like there is a hatred for these movies for some reason and my only conclusion is that a massive amount of lord of the rings fanboys do not have anything better to do with their time than bash a saga that is way superior then them in every form of the word. I hope that they do release the other 2 prequels and the original trilogy because seeing them on the big screen is something worth paying for.",1

So much happens that it's hard to keep up with it all and I'd love to see it again but I just can't stomach that Jar Jar guy's voice. I really liked Darth Maul, as did everyone else I talked to.  Why do we get so much of Jar Jar who everyone hates and so little of Darth Maul who everyone likes?  Go figure.  Without Jar Jar, I'd have probably seen this movie several times by now so I think Lucas is hurting his films with his fanatical desire to keep the outer space equivalent to Gilligan in the series.  In the sea monster sequence, Jar Jar distracts you from the coolest sea monsters ever put on the screen.  I'll wait till this is on video to watch it again so I can at least turn off the volume.  I keep hoping Lucas will do a ""special edition"" with Jar Jar digitally painted out of the film and his voice stripped off the soundtrack.",1
1451,8.0,"When my friends and I arrived an hour early for the matinee show (with advance tickets purchased last Wednesday, of course) we eagerly chattered about the coming epiphany.  Then, after too many, too long previews, the Lucasfilm logo and that familiar soundtrack lit up the screen, followed by the most famous words in cinematic history. Those first few moments were my favorite in the movie.  I describe myself as one of the countless sencond-generation SW lovers.  And I'm a die-hard fanatic. But George, where's the emotion??  The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie. I will recommend it to my friends.  But, although the effects were smashing and the technology mind-blowing, I felt a huge chunk of the Star Wars appeal was missing from Phantom. You've read it elsewhere, and here it is again: You just don't feel for the characters.  No romance, no Harrison Ford (okay guys, and no Princess Leia in bikini), and no heartbreaking scenes.  The final lightsaber battle wasn't bad in that regard, but when Neeson's character was killed, I didn't feel as I did when Obi-wan died in ANH.  Why?? I don't know. The actors here are talented, but I feel someone told them not to ACT!! Natalie Portman is undeniably gifted, but she seems so dispassionate throughout.  The film could have been greatly enhanced by a little emotion on everyone's behalf. I did not like the ""touching"" scene between Ani and his mother.  Not only was it forced and unbelievable, the dialogue was not the quality of the first trilogy. I understand that, following the traditional three-act play format, George will introduce everyone here, then develop his characters in future films. I hope so. Enough rotten tomatoes.  I DID love the final lightsaber battle-there was something ultimately menacing about Darth Maul's double-edged saber.  But why must every saber battle take place beside an open pit??  And I'm so glad the Jawas made an appearance at the Podrace to deliver a resounding Ootidi! I suppose the things that pleased me most were those that reminded me of the first trilogy. My final word:  I loved the foreshadowing of the impeding rise of the Dark Side--the reference to the Dark Lords and the profile shot of young Anakin and Senator Palpatine.  But then came the ending--just too darn HAPPY!!  I was looking for something a little more suspenseful, something that will lead into the coming films.  But at least Ani finally got a haircut.",1

1453,,"I liked the first star wars movie, and it was fine that Lucas felt the story should be told in two films. In fact, the second was even better in my opinion, far more intelligent and ""realistic"" from a thematic standpoint (had a terrific climax and denouement, but not the cliched ""happy ending""). The third was geared too much for the series' juvenile audience, indicating the producer's excessive commercial emphasis. Now this one has been taken a step further, with a child actually being the star of the movie! As if that wasn't bad enough, we've got awful (yes, awful!) special effects; fake lightening, easily recognized computer animation, and electric springboards, which do not enhance the feature one iota. As for the story, it seems that Lucas spent years planning the technical aspects of the film and left the script for the last few days. Anakin Skywalker born of an immaculate conception???? (didn't know he was Jesus) Obi Wan Kenobi had a braided longlock??? A 20 minute replay of Ben Hur with Jabba the Hut in place of Pontius Pilate??? Even with that aside, why did Lucas have to steal ideas from star trek, subsituting boring political and bureaucracy nonsense for the high-powered action scenes which made the original films so famous? The sad fact is, George Lucas's entire career (which has netted him over 2 billion dollars, the largest amount for anyone in hollywood) is based on one film. The product tie-ins: toys, beverage glasses, t-shirts, breakfast cereals, reruns, video tapes, video games,...... have made him so wealthy that it doesn't pay for him not to produce an endless series of sequels, no matter how ridiculous they are.",0

People constantly call him a ""genius"", but I'm not sure he even understands the film medium at all! When it comes to the script, the fact that Lucas has complete control over his material means that he's his own worst enemy. If he didn't have total control, there might be someone else empowered to say ""It needs to be clearer when Amidala is Amidala and when she's Padme"" - ""Don't waste this forcefield bit - lets have some explanatory dialogue"" - ""Cut Jar-Jar Binks"".

I was more interested in seeing my favorite characters on the big screen again, looking a bit younger of course. Yoda, C-3PO, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Senator Palpatine (Later EMPEROR PALPATINE), Jabba The Hutt and Anakin Skywalker are all going to connect to the later movies sometime or another, even if several of them were seen briefly.

The strange thing is, this is supposed to be thirty years before A New Hope, and the creatures are more life-like, the ships are faster, there's more dramatic battles, and there's whole armies of droids that are much badder than the Stormtroopers. This sounds more like Episode 101, doesn't it? The effects are overblown and there is an extreme over-reliance on CG effects than there is story. The acting is absolutely terrible. It's kinda sad to see all these good actors not even try to make something out of an already crappy script. One more thing: Jar Jar sucks.",0

In the world's defense, they did not know what they were getting into. The beginning of the film tells us that it is doomed from the start. Zero character development... Just light sabers. Hard to believe the previous installments were compelling. However, I can see what Lucas was trying to do. He was trying to find familiarity. He did it in the wrong thing, it is better to find familiarity in plot points and certain details, sadly he tried to find it in more lasting things, like characters. That is where surprisingly, where the film reaches its lows. He tries to make it an ensemble thing. In a film like this, that setup cannot work. He needed to give one character, and I do mean one character a focus, or a journey. You need to get attached to characters before they engage in risky situations, it will have more of an effect because your emotional effect resonates into making the characters go through real peril. This setup does not work, that's why the film fails. The performances do not make this film better, not one bit. Liam Neeson and Ian McGregor give decent performances, but the real weak link is Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker, and Ahamed Best as Jar Jar Binks. Both easily some of the worst performances from a child actor, and an actor in general I have ever seen. In Anakin's case, he needed to be a teenager or a young adult, that will make more of the situations he goes through believable. But Jar Jar, I despised every waking moment, every dollar wasted through CGI, every second I heard his grinding, agonizing voice, the bottom line is that this character was not needed, ever, what were you thinking George? What were you thinking? There actually was something I liked from this film- Samuel L Jackson as a Jedi! Best casting ever, enough said.

Jar Jar Binks has to be one of the most irritating characters to ever grace the Silver Screen. I don't know if I've written anything that might be considered a ""spoiler"" since this movie can't be spoiled any more than it already is. Use your time more constructively.

Pick the lint from your clothes dryer lint screen with tweezers. Anything you can do would be better than subjecting yourself to this movie. I normally would say the screenwriter should be dragged out into the street and shot, but I do still have a certain respect for George Lucas. Anyone who can get a movie company to make Episode II and III after this junk-fest is a genius. I may hate the movie, but you gotta admire someone who can crap a script like this and have it labeled ""gold"".",0

1493,6.0,"The little teddy bears from Jedi were actually pretty cool when compared to Jar Jar Binks, the single worst character in the history of the Star Wars franchise. He's even more annoying than Hayden Christenson's Anakin Skywalker, which is saying a LOT.

And who could forget the special effects?  The category that made Star Wars famous in the first place? (Arguably).  Definitely at least a nine and a half out of ten on my Cool-o-Meter.  (Actually, a ten, but saying that would make me look like I was influenced by hype). Okay, so it's cool, is that all?  No.  Of course not.  All of that bogus junk that the film critics are saying about the plot and the characters is just plain stupid.  The story is complex and detailed.  It is a great plot with a great balance of happiness, sadness, anger, and love. The actually story has some great lines in it too (none of which coming from Jar Jar Binks, the only of the computer animated characters who actually gets annoying).  And the characters?  The are developed.  At least no less than in Episodes IV-VI. Queen Amidala is wonderful.  She has a totally believable personality. Qui-Gon is great too.  In fact they all are.  All of them.  Well, all but that Jar Jar fellow.  He should have appeared less--in the latter scenes he should have been replaced by C-3PO.  But in general, the characters are all well drawn by the dialogue, body language, and especially by THE MUSIC. So do I recommend The Phantom Menace to anyone?  Yes, but only if you were a kid once.  (Or someone like me who IS a kid--14).  I'd have to give it 9 out of 10.  Why?  Because it deserves it.  No more, no less.  But I do wish that the CRITIQUES lay off it a bit. A message to you SATIRISTS: Episode One is a film.  A film in itself. A film a part of a whole NEW trilogy--the first in it for that matter.  BE OPEN to the new trilogy.  Stop comparing it to the old one.  Sure, these events lead to the next Trio, but welcome the new styles and be kind to them.  Stop wasting precious newspaper space babbling on about how the new film is different than the others.  IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.  I think your only two questions to yourself should be: 'Did I enjoy it?' and 'If it were the FIRST Star Wars film released, THEN how would I rate it?' The answers would be 'Yes' and 'An epic of a tale', respectively.",1

First it's a feast for the eyes with its tremendous special effects and fictional ""beings"".  The film deals with all the elements of humanity --- history, science, psychology, philosophy, sociology, morality, and emotion. There is so much to absorb.  George Lucas has woven an excellent tale with fascinating characters. My only criticism is Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor probably my two favorite actors seem underutilized.  Although as I've said it's a feast for the eyes, the dialogue and acting done or needed from the leads was a bit underwhelming.  I'm not so sure this wasn't Mr. Lucas' intent --- not to overshadow the storyline in any way.  Regardless it was great entertainment.  Three and a half stars!!!",1

With the exception of the Jar Jar character (really disturbing the film for its excessive clumsy presence), I think this Episode is the perfect introduction to the entire SW-movie saga: the atmosphere is positive, shiny, rich, elegant and it couldn't be different because nothing happened yet. Note the elegance of the starships, of the dresses, even of the droids: they're going to be in contrast with the ""darkness"" that's going to come and that it's going to show clearly, to me, only in Episode III; and what about the continuous links to what's going to happen (see the ascending of Palpatine, the thoughts of Yoda during Qui Gon's funeral, etc...)?

This is pretty much because the movie goes back to the old times - the Jedi are still existant, Obi-Wan is a mere Jedi apprentice, and the Galactic Republic, not the Empire, is in power. The story is mostly irrelevant to anything in ANH, ESB, or ROTJ. The plot delivers only two main things which factor into the original trilogy - the Sith is back, and a promising new Jedi (but Vader-to-be) is found - Anakin Skywalker. New characters are introduced, like the horribly annoying Gungan creature Jar Jar Binks. This guy is a disgrace to all things Star Wars - you wonder why he's even there in the first place. But there are many cool new characters and features, too. Sinister villain Darth Maul, the sleek Naboo Starfighter, and the completely sweet podracing are just a few. And Anakin is awesome.",1

What I cannot understand is why George Lucas felt he needed to create a film that was designed purely to sell merchandise. He has no need for the money so WHY? The result of all this is a third rate kids film. Yes it has great special effects but it does not make up for the complete absense of plot, structure and characterisation. I can find very little by way of good things to say about this film, and I hold little hope for the next two movies either, I just hope that the money Lucas made from selling Ja Ja Binks lunch-boxes makes up for the total loss of respect from every true star wars fan out there.",1

It doesn't matter what the critics say, they go to a movie to analyze the characters, and the plot, and the settings, and the costumes....honestly, sounds like a real boring job.  I think they've lost touch in what actually makes a good movie.  Star Wars is like a book, incomplete in its separate chapters, exquisite as a whole.  It's about story telling, not about the individual episodes.  And YES, it does seem to be setting up for the next two movies, but duh, if you're just realizing this now, you don't deserve to see, feel, experience the awesome story telling ability of George Lucas.

1515,10.0,"After watching Episode I if you are feeling let down, think about why for a second. Did you try to write Episode I yourself, and then became disappointed that George Lucas wrote the story his way instead? Did you expect to see Darth Maul share half the screen time with the Jedi Knights? Well guess what, this isn't your movie, and there is a specific reason why Darth Mual has limited screen time. What is the purpose of Episode I? To establish the Sith, and to reveal how Anakin Skywalker, 1.becomes associated with the Jedi, and 2.meets the mother of his future children. So, what is Darth Maul's purpose in the film? He is there as the bad guy who 1. kills Qui-Gonn (we all knew he had to die sometime before Episode IV) and 2.reveals to the Jedi the existence of the Sith. He serves his purpose exactly. Qui-Gonn dies, and Yoda and Mace know that somewhere out there there is another Dark Lord of the Sith= Darth Sidios. The Phantom Menace refers to Darth Sidios. He is the Menace that is right before everyone's eyes, but yet isn't seen. And if you are confused by the plot as some are, again, think. The reason that the film revolves around the battle for Naboo, is because Darth Sidios creates the battle for Naboo. The question is why? Why? So that he can be elected as Supreme Chancellor after the removal of Valorum. This is the sole reason that Naboo is invaded, so that Senator Palpatine can be elected Supreme Chancellor after forcing the vote of no confidence on Valorum. Bottom line is the film is great, and anyone that criticizes the plot as confusing, or Lucas for not using Darth Maul more, just needs to THINK. This film comes before Episodes IV, V, VI. Certain things MUST be set up, and certain things MUST happen. If you don't try and write the movie on your own, ahead of time, then you won't be disappointed.",0

Remember that Lucas has never professed a desire to create anything more than ""a Saturday afternoon serial for kids,"" and approach it the same way you would any of the Star Wars films.  The special effects are light years beyond anything that's been seen on film. Yet, at the same time, amid all of the CGI marvels, there is a healthy dose of ""guys in rubber suits"" aliens whom we know and love from the first three films.  Yoda himself is the same puppet used in the first films, with some minor age adjustments.  That split is a perfect characterization of this first Star Wars film in 16 years.

This one is a lot funnier than the others, and has THE coolest villain of them all, Darth Maul. With his ominous presence and ultra-cool fighting style, he was by far the best of the new characters (although he only had at the most 15 minutes of screen time). I could have lived without the Darth Maul ""situation"" at the end of the movie (once you see it, you'll know what I mean). It was the only disappointment in a wonderful piece of filmmaking.

It is well-done how he and the Gungans speak, but his moves and 'humourous' character somehow does not fit in the movie, despite this one is supposed to be the 'most peaceful' of all the previous SW movies. It is also one minor flaw that the characters have apparent fluke. If I were to detail it, I would have to add spoilers, which I don't desire. Watch the film or recall what you have seen and you will see what I mean. Go to the positive part this time: In the movie, the long forgotten Sith return and the Sith Apprentice confront Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. For those who still have not yet seen the film: Qui-Gon Jinn is the master of Obi-wan, who is still an apprentice. The Sith Lord vs. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight scene is probably the culmination of the events and this part is done the best. We will also see the Jedi in 'normal' combat against droids, which show how Jedi can fight. The plot is based around a conflict on a peaceful planet named Naboo, which the Trade Federation blockaded for various reasons. By the will of the Force, the two Jedi get stranded down on Tatooine, where they discover Anakin Skywalker, who actually helps them escape the planet. We will see a long 'pod race' scene on Tatooine, which could be amazing or damn boring, depending on your attitude to speed. I liked this part of the film the first time I saw it, but I normally skip this when I am to watch the film over again on VHS. When the final attack starts to retake the planet, the events are divided into three parts: We can see all three emerge victorious at various costs.

Yet, of course, there are flaws. Like those stupid midi-clorians stuff. What was George Lucas thinking!? Or the horrible acting by Jake Lloyd. Or the character Darth Maul, who was the most pointless mistake of a villain. He was in what, 4 scenes, maybe 5? Yet as you're watching the movie, though, you forget all that. I am a Star Wars maniac, and I put Star Wars on a very high level above ""normal"" movies. Yet when I saw Phantom Menace, I didn't expect it to be on that same level because when Star Wars came out, there was nothing ever like it before. Now every sci/fi movie wants to copy it, so when a new Star Wars comes out, you think, "" oh i've seen that in every other sci/fi movie."" But that's not George Lucas's fault. It's not his fault that every futuristic action adventure wants to be like Star Wars. I also didn't expect it to have the impact as the first one did. I expected it to have the impact as Return of the Jedi. I also disagree with the critics saying it has no human magic. It does, yet you concentrate so much on the visuals, that you sort of forget about it. But it's there, isn't it? All in all, Episode 1 has many flaws, but so did the other ones. It is a fun experience that fits very well with the other Star Wars movies.

It is basically a 133 minute movie made for selling toys and making big bucks at the box office. Plus, where has Lucas's creativity gone? He used to make aliens that were ""cool"" and even ""works of puppetry genius"" but now all we get is that moron Jar Jar Binky. Yes, I call him that. I hate him. One of my friends who has seen the movie and likes it said that the person who played Jar Jar gave a great acting performance, and I agreed with him until I went home, popped in my copy of Episode 1 and watched some random scenes with Mr. Binky in them. HE STINKS! Jar Jar is the worst insult since the ""Special"" Editions! But despite all of this, there are a few reasons to watch this movie. 1- The visuals are mind-blowing! Love those! 2- Liam Neeson! And even though Lucas can't write his lines for scrap, it's good to see Neeson in Star Wars. 3- Awesome light-saber battle! Love it! 4- Podrace! Gotta love those podraces!

1544,5.0,"I have to admit, I enjoyed watching 'The Phantom Menace' when it was on at the cinema. I was swept in by the special effects and thought Jar Jar was hilarious. However, when I sat down to watch it seriously, I was severely let down. George Lucas has obviously lost his film-making touch throughout the years. He doesn't concentrate on the characters enough, and there are too many special effects, some of which are very obvious. Considering the acting talent he had at his disposal, I would have thought that this film would be as good as the original trilogy was, but it wasn't. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman all just seem to go through the motions, and this is one film I think they should leave off their resumes. And as for Jake Lloyd...well, if Lucas wanted to surprise the audience by showing them what Darth Vader/Anakin was like as a child, then he has succeeded a little too much. Lloyd is extremely irritating in that ""child actor"" way, and I really did think he was even more annoying than Jar Jar (who is basically a black stereotype made to look like an alien). I liked the John Williams score, but it just isn't enough here.",0
1545,6.0,"First off, I'm not a ""Star Wars"" or SF fan (which is why I waited about three weeks before seeing the movie).  Also, I heard the movie was aimed squarely at 12 year olds (I heard this from fans of ""Star Wars""!), and added zero to the story.  So I didn't expect much.  Surprisingly I sort of liked it.  It is too long, some sections left me really confused (Darth Vader is a virgin birth?) and at the end I just felt like I had seen another movie, no better or worse than an average one.  First off, as said before it rambles on and on.  This could haven been cut short by half an hour.  Second, Lucas is not an actors' director--and it shows.  McGregor and Neeson were so stone-faced I couldn't believe it.  Portman was howlingly lousy. Admittedly, they were trying to react to something that wasn't there, but come on!  They're actors--that's their job!  As for Jar Jar Bink--he was annoying and very unfunny.  All of his lines and antics met with stony silence from my audience.  Only the actress who played Darth's mother showed any emotion.  All that said, the special effects were superb with two standout sequences--the pod race and the fight between Obi-Wan, Qui-Jon(sp?) and Darth Maul.  Those two sequences made up for the many shortcomings in the movie.  All in all see it for the special effects.  There's no good acting and the story is yawningly familar.",0

Episode 1 is filled ( and I mean filled) with special effects, watch the original Star Wars (before they fixed it up) then watch Episode 1 WHAT A CHANGE!!!!! The original had good effects but WOW for episode 1, it deserves an academy award. For the plot, I had no problems. It is very good for the characters, now what will happen in episode 2? One of the best things in Episode 1 is how when it is over not all the problems are solved, we still have to teach Anakin Skywalker to be a jedi(but we all know that doesn't turn out right). You don't have to be a fan of the movies to understand or like this movie, my friend hadn't seen the other movies and she loved it!

1549,,"I think that Star Wars Episode: ONE rates at a 5 out of 10. I think this because of two things. First is it's excellen graphics and second on its lame plot. This movie I consider a good movie to see if you like star wars a lot but otherwise it's not quite worth your time. I have to congratulate Lucas on his excellent computer generated graphics. I waoul say that this is the break though incomputer graphics for movies. Throughout the entir movie there is something that is computer generated. This seems hard but what is even harder would be the scene when an actor has to tackle a computer-generated character. If you want to see good graphics and special effects then this is the movie to see. However it seem s that Lucas spent so much time on the graphics it seems that he neglected the rest of the movie. The two main characters have this thing they do which is complete trust in there ablities to know the right spot to stand to not be shot. Seeing a droid miss them for the fourtieth time is just to much. The plot is also lack with two jedi sent out to stop the evil trade federation doesn't quite appeal. Last luck is always with them even in all logic they would be killed. one example of this is when Anakin accidently fires a torpeoe that accidently sets off a chain reaction that saves the day. Luck just acts funny in this movie. All this considered this is a better than average movie so if you have the time then see it but otherwis there probably is something better for you to do. The graphics are the best, and the acting isn't horrible. Last the plot to describe the plot ""Its Star Wars"".Byron SRVUSD",0

George Lucas should have spent the sixteen year layoff between films to write a decent script rather than wait for effects to catch up to his vision.

1557,4.0,"The first episode to the Star Wars saga was never going to live up to or surpass the hype it was given and we all knew that most of the critics would pan it. But to be honest, the negative reviews were far more accurate than any positive review I read. On the whole, it's not a bad film, but the problem is that none of the heart and soul that was poured into the other episodes is present here. Lucas had always said that this one would be just to set-up the story. Well Episode Four didn't have that problem. ""But it's the story, its the story,"" Lucas kept saying. Maybe, the trouble with that it isn't a very interesting story George boy. Everything about The Phantom Menace is flat and lifeless. The writing the direction, the action and the performances. Neeson is poorly cast as Qui Gon Jin, while McGregor speaks like a public boy with a large plum in the back of his throat as Kenobi. The plot isn't as nearly as compelling as the other three films either. The Trade Federation boundaries being in dispute sound as thrilling as the as the content of European sausages. And who cares if Portman as the Queen ever signs a stupid treaty or if Terence Stamp is voted out of the Senate? True the special effects are impressive, but without the rich characterisation of the previous films, we don't really care about the outcome. The action scenes seem rushed because Lucas has lost nearly all of his sense of timing and none of them come close to the fantastic Death Star assault at the end of the 1977 film. The nadir though has to be the suggestion of the virgin birth of Anakin Skywalker... please! None of the assurance and character of the previous films is present here and the only positive feeling you have coming away from it is that, hopefully it is setting up a stronger story for the next episodes. To end on a personal note, I remember that Time Out wrote about the original film ""even if you've been entertained, you may feel cheated of something"". I hardly ever agree with Time Out, but that quote pretty much sums up my thoughts; not on Star Wars Episode IV, which was made on a mere $6 million, but on The Phantom Menace, which cost 20 times as much.",0

Despite the fact that I obviously could not fully comprehend what I was seeing, I loved every minute of it right away. I have never stopped adoring the original trilogy - they remain some of my most beloved films to this day. ",1
1562,6.0,"Making a comparison between the first film of the original trilogy of ""Star Wars"" and the first one of the prequels is just heartbreaking. Where there was fun and wit, there are dumb, flat, B-comedy jokes. Where there were fantastic characters there are weak, poor and sometimes irritating characterizations that make you hate the new ones and even the old ones in their new guise. ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" is easily the most disappointing film ever, considering the hype and hope that everybody had at the time to see something that could stand between the originals. I usually say that the prequels can't be canon, they must be considered a fan fiction that someone started as a kid (Episode I), then continued as a frustrated emo teenager (Episode II) and ended as a disillusioned adult (Episode III). Jokes aside -if that is to be considered a joke-, it's very hard for a fan to not get angry at all this mess. Story-wise, the introduction of a scientific reason behind the Force is a gigantic mistake, as it takes away all of the magic aura the concept was surrounded by. Character-wise, Ana-kid is unbearable and his final act is so random you'd hope you never saw it, while the others are barely easier to sympathize with, also thanks to some of the most wooden performances by otherwise good actors. The baddies in this one are most significantly represented by the honestly good looking Darth Maul, but his haunting looks are not supported by an adequate personality, which is as thin as paper. Even the music is not as good as before, consolidating my idea that John Williams perfectly molds his soundtracks on the movie, for better or for worse. Let's take a breath, though, and evaluate the silver linings. The massive CGI use is still impressive, with a number of strange and imaginative creatures and vehicles (in the best Star Wars tradition), with kinda-exciting scenes where characters shut up and let the computer graphics entertain. And, fortunately, they do. So, although I hate when that happens, special effects and a little imagination on Lucas's side help the otherwise messed up movie.",0

I liked the Darth Maul character and his lifesaver but the only thing was they didn't really tell much about him at all like where he came from I know he was with the emperor. Liam Neesen who I really like since he comes from one of my all time favorites KRULL did a good job in this. In the next one I hope they have C3PO in it more than what they did in this one. Hopefully by the third prequel they will have Luke,Leid and Han in it. My favorite character was of course Jar Jar Binks he was hilarious!!!",1
1566,,"The special effects that can be found throughout The Phantom Menace sets an example of its high imagination.  While it ultimately gets to a point where it more than ever feels like an exhibition for the special effects, they're top notch never the less.  The same really can't be said about the story itself.  First of all, the character development is lacking.  For the most part, the characters are presented in an one-dimensional fashion (especially several characters who play a pivotal role in the story but are ultimately giving fairly little to do) and it could have gone deeper with the background of the planet Naboo.  The restricted character development seems more apparent based on the fact the there's other film that's going follow up on The Phantom Menace.  Also, there's a feeling that the movie is trying too hard in the comic relief department at times (i.e. Jar Jar Binks who's dialog can be pretty incomprehensible on certain occasions).  In spite of this, there are about two points in the story that is able to generate the most excitement (a quickly paced race, and a light-saber duel).  The light-saber duel (with the music aiding things) starts out on a quick pace but then stops in the middle of the whole sequence and eventually goes back into a quick pace.",1

I also got the feeling the film was just focused-grouped and test-marketed to death, in a vain attempt to be all things to all people.  In the back of my mind, I could never shake the thought that the main purpose of this film was to sell toys.  I would enjoy the Star Wars films a lot more if it wasn't so big of a franchise.  I found Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element to be a more satisfying and honest sci-fi adventure, and I like the fact that it will most likely be sequal-less.  I also liked the fact that it took itself much less seriously, and didn't have the weight of an entire franchise on it's shoulders, which I think was a major problem with The Phantom Menace.",1

1579,3.0,"Oh my gosh I hate this movie so much. For all of the 3 people out there who are lucky enough not to have seen this god awful movie, let me fill you in. We have a Star Wars movie that heavily focuses on weak characters and political crap that even an adult can barely follow or comprehend. You got that right. A Star Wars movie is heavily focused on political stuff. WHY?! Believe it or not, that's not even the movie's biggest problem. What is the biggest problem you may ask? JAR JAR BINKS. Oh my gosh I hate Jar Jar so much! The CGI on him is awful, his voice is ear-grading, he does nothing but constantly get himself and others into trouble or get makes really painful juvenile jokes! Speaking of which, none of the characters are likable except for Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul and maybe Qui-Gon Jinn which I'll get to later. Yeah, even Anakin is a terrible character. He's whiny, disrespectful, obnoxious and bratty. Okay, it is cool that he can fly a podracer and make droids but we can't focus on the good aspects of his character when all he does in be a brat. The only time it's justified is when he leaves his mother to be a slave. Also, the whole midichlorian thing really angered me for reasons that are honestly kind of hard to explain so I won't get into it. However, I don't think this movie is all terrible. There are some good and even great aspects of this movie. One is the action scenes. The lightsaber duels are much better here than they are in the original trilogy. The second one is the funeral scene. Surprisingly, it's a very serious scene and the emotional stakes are very high. Third, the score is amazing and Duel of the Fates is one of the best pieces of music ever written. Speaking of Duel of the Fates, the battle between Obi-Wan, Qui- Gon and Darth Maul was amazing.

Then, when they finally show Darth Vader, who isn't even called Darth Vader and doesn't even wear black and is even shorter than David Prowse and doesn't even kill or torture people, they never do that thing where after the people exit their scene with Darth Vader (here portrayed as Little Fatherless Ani)--the people who we're shown not suspecting that Darth Vader will kill them--that thing where the camera focuses on Darth Vader's evil eyes and he squints like Clint Eastwood and he looks round suspiciously so we in the audience can get that he's evil and stuff.

I did not think JarJar that bad, but I think he made the end battle where he is present rather silly. I remember thinking when the talk about midichlorians turned up that I was an idiot.

1588,6.0,"Many people have said that Star wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is the worst of all the Star Wars films. Well whilst it doesn't match any of the original trilogy it is a better film than either of the other prequels. The film follows the story of a young Anakin Skywalker after he is picked up by two Jedi on his home planet. One of the Jedi in question is a youthful Obi Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor. The other Qui Gonn Jinn is played very well by Liam Neeson and its probably the best performance the film offers. The other part of the story involves an evil federation who wish for the Queen of a planet named Naboo to sign a treaty between them. The federation is run by the evil Darth Sideous and the very nasty and skillful Darth Maul. The stories cross well and in the end its an all and out battle for the planet. The acting and dialogues are wooden for the most part but with the exception of Harrison Ford the franchise has never strayed from simple and adequate performances. As for the dialogues, again Star wars is certainly not what I associate with fantastic scripts. Indeed it is the action sequences and mythology that powers this film along. It carrys that certain something that the other prequels lacked and which the original films were so rich in. That certain something is fun and the film has it in abundance. The visual effects are top of the range and the lightsaber fight at the end is the most spectacular the series has seen. Compared to the Limp Attack of the clones and forgettable Revenge of the sith Menace is a classic.So kick back and enjoy it for what it is. One kick ass Futuristic Rollar coaster ride.",1

1590,10.0,I love Star Wars and because I love it I can't gloss over TPM flaws. Jar Jar Binks is jarring at first but forgivable. The main flaw I feel is Anakin's age. Lucas say he made Anakin nine he is scarred deeper by leaving his mother (which factors in later episode's) but it also sacrifices the versimiltude of every scene he appears in. Nine-year-olds don't act like Anakin. Jake Lloyd is a fine actor but he is unsuited to the role of Anakin. Darth Maul was under used but terrific. He is among the most menacing villians ever put on film. Despite my qualms I welcome TPM into the Star Wars saga because it furthers the overall plot flawlessly.,1

1592,8.0,"Many people in the past have looked upon George Lucas' return to the Star Wars franchise with confusion. Many new fans have been won over by three simply entertaining cinematic experiences, with more characters and exotic locations than the first three installments. Episode 1 has to take most of the credit for this. Most criticism has been leveled by old hands like myself, who have held onto a false expectation that somehow 25 odd years since it's conception a story as broad in scope and complex in detail can boast the continuity of, say, a Tolkien trilogy (which were shot back to back) I have seen episode 1 now many times and find it to be very entertaining. The musical score is very good (so good it's critical pieces are reused throughout the the following two episodes) The concept of the republic, and it's capital Coruscant, show great imagination. I can understand how difficult a task it is to take the scope from a small group of rebels and then broaden it to galactic civil war. The jedi have been evolved from the mystical and largely unexplored cult of the first three releases to the para-religious servants of the republic. SFX are great, and some great work has been achieved by the stunt and fight co-ordinators. Ewan McGregor has and always will be great, although this was his weakest performance of the three (not his fault - see below) As needless as the scene was, the pod race is very cool and obviously a homage to great cinematic races of the past. The droid battle is an important scene and is also well done. Lucas would have had many sleepless nights over it. Droids are so dumb... cept artoo. Naboo royalty are very well conceived and look stunning (yes you Natalie) The story is simple yet it sometimes seems to confuse itself. You tend to go from thinking about the story and what the characters are doing to a state of thinking why did they write it that way, or they should have done something else. The basic tale is quite good and unique, and I wont go into detail as every man and his dog has seen this movie. Needless to say that this isn't exactly a tale about college fraternities or summer holiday love affair or suburban inquisition - it is a very difficult task of spreading thousands of years of history of a galactic wide government and law enforcement agency, and their ultimate doom, into three two-hour movies. Sorry, three two-hour watchable movies. Some concession must be made for the sheer size of the project.",1

The coolest scene of the movie is the last fight; that is so well directed and they have so cool costumes that I think it should take a MTV prize but it didn't. This is a cool movie ! See it !,1
1598,,"I don't understand why people think the plot of ""Phantom"" is infantile compared to the other entries of the trilogy. I mean, the others hardly had a plot. A New Hope was simply a shoot-em-up, with the ultimate goal being to destroy a big battle station. ESB was a chase movie. ROTJ was similar to the first, but with more plot. What worked with the series is the fact that it had interesting characters and, of course, the whole Anakin/Vader subplot. However, TPM's plot works on many levels, it's just that people can't seem to understand it. If they did, it would probably make a lot more sense. First off, everybody's asking: ""Why did the Nimoudians blockade Naboo?"" The answer is simple-in case you haven't figured it out yet, Senator Palpatine(The senator who Amidalia confers with on Coruscant) is in fact, Darth Sidious. He wants Naboo blockaded so it will generate strong sympathy towards him in the Senate, so he can become Supreme Chancellor. If the occupation treaty is signed, he'll get even more pity. However, it's not necessary to his overall scheme that the Neimoudians win-it would just *enhance* his chances. As for Maul, he's sent to reassure the Nimoudians, and also to get rid of those pesky Jedi, since Palpatine hates the Jedi anyway. Either way, whether the bad guys win or lose, it all goes down in Palpatine's favor. As for Jake Lloyd, the kid honestly wasn't that bad. Look at it this way-at least it wasn't the Jerry Macquire kid. The only major problem with the film is Jar-Jar, but George Lucas has taken notice of this and has lessened his role and toned down his character for Episode II. Anyway, most of the problems this film had-honestly problems people are complaining about WAY too much when they could be doing something productive-will probably be fixed with Episode II, as it appears from early reports.",0
1599,5.0,"I saw the original Star Wars when I was 6 years old, and I loved it. I had never seen anything like that before, and neither had anybody else. Having said that, the only forward progress the series made, was from Star Wars to The Empire Strikes Back. After that the movies have gotten worse by leaps and bounds. Which brings me to The Phantom Menace. This movie is embarrassing it's so bad. Every time I see Jar Jar Binks I want to shoot the TV like Elvis. The story is absolutely ridiculous, and if you can still be impressed by the special effects after the first time you see it, then I'm guessing that you're below the age of 10. After the special effects wear off, you're left with nothing but bad acting and crappy dialogue.",0
1600,,"The Phantom Menace has set up the next two films very nicely. This is the first film in a series of three that will focus on Anakin Skywalker; later known as Darth Vader. Our first glimpse of Anakin shows us that he is a very daring boy, yet has some fear inside of him. Can I see the dark side coming on? Fans of Star Wars may say this movie is too childish with characters like Jar Jar Binks populating it, but George Lucas did this in order to contrast the other two movies with this one. (Possible Spoiler Coming Up) This one was meant to be cheerful, while the other two will be a lot darker as Anakin turns to the Dark side and the fall of the Republic takes place. The Phantom Menace is another great addition to the Star Wars epic series, and has captured the souls once again of the old, and of the young.",1

The story was good, especially how it set the second movie up at the end, the special effects were the best I have ever seen in a movie to date and the acting was very good. As for Jar Jar Binks, it did not spoil the movie as some people have said. Ok so he got a bit annoying in parts, but he was really just there to keep the kids happy. I give this movie 10/10.",1

1604,2.0,"Phantom Menace is the weakest of the series. Over the last 4 or 5 days I have watched the entire four films over again. Here's my objective reasonsing behind my opinion. First, two things that I will not hold against this movie or Lucas. 1) It is impossible to follow the original trilogy, especially after 16 years. Expectations combined with the grossly overdone media hype pretty much sealed Phantom Menace's fate as a dissapointment. 2) I'm sure it is very difficult to SPECIFICALLY write a movie as part one of a trilogy and have the story make any real sense. While Lucas has always claimed that A New Hope was envisioned as the start of a trilogy, I just don't buy it. The ONLY aspect of New Hope that lent itself to a sequel was the fact that Darth Vader didn't die.",1
1605,,"Well, the first three Star Wars were unimaginative to a standstill, but the fourth part really outdoes them in having absolutely nothing to say. It's actually amazing to see how many once promising careers get wasted here: Liam Neeson doing nothing more than a weak Lex Barker-impression, Natalie Portman is forced to wear some bad hairdo to remind of the awful Carrie Fisher hairrolls, & yes, Ewan McGregor is in there somewhere - methinks, he failed to leave any impression at all, which might be all the better for him anyways, so he has not to be embarassed once he gets older. As for the plot of this one: More of an Italian early-sixties Peplum here than a enormously big budgeter, but without all the charme. Its about some kid of immaculate",0

1608,8.0,"I saw Star Wars Episode 1 this Saturday at NYC's Ziegfeld theatre.  It was just a perfect way to see the film, the crowd was into it from the get go. The visuals and the sound were amazing (if you have any problem with your ears be careful because the sound is deafening).  Lucas was able to create beautiful lush worlds and artificial creatures that seemed real. And the story was pretty effective. It left me satisfied and excited about the next 2 installments which will tidy up the series (I guess I felt the same after Empire Strikes Back, wanting to know what would be next for our heroes).",1

1611,7.0,"Like thousands of twenty-somethings who remember the excitement created over the release of ""The Return of the Jedi"" (I was 10 years old), I raced to the theater ASAP to see Lucas' newest release.  However, I must say that I was a little disappointed.  Unlike the original trilogy, there were no witty lines and virtually no character development.  A couple of characters (i.e. young Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks) were downright annoying.",0
1612,6.0,"When I first watched it, I was so so. Then I grew to dislike it (Jar Jar) but after watching the 3 prequel movies again, i grown to appreciate this movie more. It feels more like the original series than episode 2 or 3 did.",1

I'm not what one would call a hardcore Star Wars nut, but I loved the first three.  So, of course, I was excited when Episode 1 was announced and when the first trailer came out.  Then, I grew rather skeptical of it.  The hype was huge and my excitement started to wane.  Of course, I still wanted to see it.  This is when I found out what the bad reviews referred to.  The effects were incredible, the action was cool, but the actors were lame.  In particular, Jake Lloyd.  This kid should've been coached better.  Plus, a scene that I think was totally unforgivable is when Anakin destroys the imperial fleet surrounding Naboo near the end.  Everything that he did looked like an accident.  The kid didn't look like he even knew what he was doing, yet he happens to push the right buttons by mistake.  Horrible.  George Lucas should feel shamed that he completely ruined the Star Wars universe.  Will I go to see Episode 2?  Yeah, but it had better be a big improvement over this.",1
1615,,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie at all. It's not a great movie, and is certainly inferior to the original Star Wars trilogy, but it's far better than it's sequel, Attack of the Clones. The Phantom Menace is a fun and cheerful family movie. It doesn't have the memorable mythology of the original trilogy. It lacks character development, yes, and these new characters lack the likability of the original characters. That said, The Phantom Menace didn't bored me, and I enjoyed it because it delivered what it promised to deliver. It has solid performances, flat but sometimes funny dialogue (hey, it's only a kids movie), wonderful special effects and action sequences that are a lot of fun. And that was enough for me, as this is only the first chapter in the Star Wars saga and it plays better as an introduction than a real important passage of the story. We get to see new planets, places we didn't see in the original trilogy, and the story is nicely developed in a way that we meet young Anakin Skywalker and we are aware that he is just a kid, but with a special gift. Liam Neesom also manages to make his character more interesting. He is the wise jedi who encounters Anakin and becomes aware that he is not an ordinary boy. Yes, the acting could be a bit better, but it's fine enough. Another thing I want to mention is that some people believe this is inferior to Attack of the Clones, the next chapter. I strongly disagree. The direction, writing, pacing and acting in this movie are far better than in its sequel. The reason why this film works is that it only wants to be a fun kids film, and on that level it succeeds very well. Not many family movies are good, and this one is. *** out of ****",0
1616,,"The Phantom Menace is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. To people saying it was a good movie because it made money, you don't understand that people lined up with money in hand to see this because the first three movies were so good. Hopes were high but this just stunk. The main problems were that George Lucas writes the worst dialogue ever. And the acting was terrible. The little boy was awful and Jar Jar was maybe the most annoying character ever, and clearly several of the characters, like Jar Jar, were based on racial stereotypes. Pathetic. Jar Jar was like a black guy from the 1800s. And the guy who owned the scrap yard was Italian, and the evil scheming aliens in the trade confederation were Asians. George Lucas must have some problems with other cultures. Second, the first movies were good when they used real puppets, it just looked more real, I don't know why Lucas has to rely so much on CGI when, as good as it can get, it still doesn't look REAL. Yoda looked stupid in these movies compared to the original, puppet Yoda. And the plot was dumb. The only good performance was Qui Gon Jin. This was stupid!",0

I steered clear of them as much as I could so I would be able to go into the film with as much of an open mind as possible. I only began reading other reviews today. I have to say that I am on the side of many other critics who are critical of the film. I was not a big fan of the first three ""Star Wars"" films, but I wanted to put all that aside and go into the film with the hope that something had changed. In the theater where I saw the film, there was a loud countdown before the projector was started and I felt as much adrenaline pumping as anyone, but after it was all over, I came out with mixed emotions about the film.",1

This is not a true line from the movie, but it may as well have been.  Why don't we raise the story level and character development in the next one please Mr. Lucas, at least to a teenage level.  Adults do go to see these movies in the hope of seeing some character development and a story worthy of their money and not something that was created with the hidden agenda of developing characters that will make for good toys and figurines and Happy Meal box additions.",1

That film focused on people and had a strong story and was something new--something we had never seen before.

It's little more than a shiny toy--a big screen video game--all flash and no substance. The film looks and sounds great, as always, but there doesn't seem to be any heart behind it. Just the desire to sell more action figures. The CGI characters and sets just lack something. Everything is too perfect. I have no doubt that it'll become one of the, if not THE highest grossing picture of all time but it'll just show how easy to please the public has become. Well, I'm not going to wait in line for Episodes two or three. It won't be worth it.",1

The FX are part of the story, and woven into it smoothly, so they don't look like something tacked on or the basis for it in the first place. The story threads the fine line between being complex and being ""too deep"" (The events that must occur to describe the fall of a galactic  government is not easy to squeeze into the 7 or so hours available for three movies -- this does not allow for tremendous depth).

Obi-Wan being the wise old hermit that he is should have more lines than ""yes master"". The other wise old hermit that we new as Yoda is now a bumbling know-it-all. At least Samuel L. Jackson gave a great portrayal of Mace Windu. Darth Maul should have been seen more than a ten minute lightsaber battle (which was amazing). Qui-Gon is a very wise Jedi but takes up too much of Obi-Wan's screen time. Viceroy Gunray and his partner are (very) bad Chinese imitations. Too many bad guys for one movie.

Consider the time when Anakin meets Obi-Wan Kenobi. I know that in my mind, the final lightsaber battle between the two flashed through at that moment. There is the point when Anakin singlehandedly destroys the Trade Federation's flagship, a vessel that resembles the Death Star in more ways than one. Yet my favorite moment in the film is when Yoda and Mace Windu discuss the existence of the Dark Jedi. They wonder which was killed, the master, or the apprentice. As their conversation ends, the camera slowly pans across the room to focus on the ""master,"" Senator Palpatine. Very well done, I must say.

The atmosphere and excitement for this movie has never been matched which is why I didn't even find it disappointing.  The fight sequences were amazing especially the showdown between Darth Maul vs. Obi-Wan and Qui-gon Jinn.  I believe that the movie's classic themes, that is good vs. evil and the power of the Force were definitely present here but they just were not as effective elements this time around.  My only other complaint was that some of the special effects seemed to be a little distracting but the amount of complexity in developing some of the shots is unreal.

Because of fear they won't train him and he's too old. This due is like 7 and of course he's gonna be fearful in a room with a bunch of old men deciding his fate. It's very weird why they won't train him even though Qui Gon a Jedi Master believes he's the one of the prophecy. Regardless when the councils tell him no they won't accept him as a Jedi, he tells them to his face he will train Anakin anyway and the council doesn't do anything about it. I guess you can just ignore the Jedi council wishes without any consequences.<br /><br />Midi-Chlorian is a stupid retcon in the series and instead of the force being a mystical force that binds all life together. It's weird cells in your body, and the more you have the stronger you are.<br /><br />The Jedi face no real danger in this movie as the droids are so easily defeated every time which means the movie rarely has statues.<br /><br />Movie would have flopped if it wasn't for it being Star Wars related.",0

John Williams' music is great, as always, and the Queen Amidala costumes and makeup look stunning (as does the design for Darth Maul).

First the good, the story was fine as it introduced us to characters that we've seen in the original and how they came about and of course, I liked how Darth Sidious came up with such a masterful plan that eventually worked in a later movie. I enjoyed how Anakin went from slave to eventually padawan learner.

Second, knowing what he's going to be, you have to take him seriously and young Jedis and future Sith people don't 'whoopie' and 'oops' what are you going to send him too? Preschool?

It seems as if the Star Wars of old have gone from action, adventure movies that left you feeling good when you left the theatre to a modern times Hamlet trilogy. Shallow characters, thin plot line, too much childish humor are the main flaws pointed out by the detractors of this movie. The reality of it is, however, that ALL the Star Wars movies, maybe save Empire, had the exact same flaws. Was A New Hope that involved in the characters? Was the dialogue Tarantino esque? Was the plot line complex, with millions of little nuances that only the most astute movie goer would pick up on? Or, was Star Wars the greatest good evil movie/s to ever come out? I think it is the later.",0
1669,10.0,"After having read several negative reviews on this movie, and being an avid Star Wars fan that has hyped this motion picture up in my head as much as it has been hyped in the media, I was ready for a let-down. The other three were so good, and made for such an enjoyable time at the theatre that I felt the only way it could go was down. Well, the movie didn't surpass any of the others, but it definitely didn't drop to the bottomless pit of all-hype-no-substance movies. First off, the acting in this movie is great, right up to par with the usual Jedi masters of old, even though one did wish for the intervention of a Han Solo type character half way through. Liam Neeson was a great, patient Jedi master who was complimented well by the outstanding Ewen McGregor, who was perfect as the stubborn, all talent and fury, Obi Wan Kenobi. Jake Lloyd, for all the criticisms, played the role he was cast in perfectly. It is hard for me to understand what the critics wanted out of this young man, he played the courageous young boy to perfection, and was able to subtly foreshadow what we all know he will become well. Darth Maul was chilling, and my only regret is that he couldn't have had more scenes in the movie, but the battle scenes involving him are absolutely magnificent. The effects, as was expected, are second to none, and even though the computer animation is obvious, it does not ruin any of the realism of the movie. The pod race, which is a mix between Ben Hur and the speed racer scenes in Redi, is wonderful, and really signifies when the movie takes off into the land of outstanding movies. The Queen is great, and even though she does not have the Lea attitude, she portrays the stoic Queen very well. The only real problem I have with this movie, and what will keep it from being one of my all time favorites, is unfortunately one character. Jar Jar Bing, I believe that is what he is called, is sooooooo annoying that I spent the first half of the movie wishing he was not in it. The kids will love his antics, but for comic relief he only goes to ruin what would otherwise be great scenes. Honestly, if you go to this movie, and after about a half an hour feel as if you are destined to hate the entire thing, ask yourself why and the answer will be Jar Jar Bing. I will see this movie again because I honestly spent the first half hour of it hating Bing and thinking I was going to hate the movie. If you feel the same way, take care, you will end up loving it by the end. If anyone associated with the movie reads this, KILL JAR JAR BING!!!!! Besides that, Titanic, enjoy the next month or so as the highest grossing movie ever, because Obi Wan, Anakin, and Darth Maul are coming to get you:) May the force be with you, because it was with this movie.",1

It didn't excite my imagination and it didn't make me think about it all the time (unlike the original). That's it! I said to myself. I didn't care about the characters and the story was boring. Being a writer myself now, I can say George Lucas did not think through his story. Unlike the ""Original"" the ""No Good Movie"" did not speak to a person's heart. The ""Phantom"" did not reach into mythology and make us ponder the eternal questions of human existence. The ""No Good movie"" did not touch upon the ""eternal questions"" brought up by the original ""Star Wars"". The questions are: why we are here, what is our purpose in life, what is the struggle between good and evil, etc. The original ""Star Wars"" movie addressed these issues and has become timeless and immortal in status as a result.

However, I did not find the characterizations of Jar-Jar and his people racist, because I did not feel that they were portrayed in a negative way. They were supposed to be brave warriors, they weren't stupid, and Jar-Jar's clumsiness and ineptness did not afflict the entire race.

Jar Jar Binks-What can I say that hasn't been said? He would have been annoying given a few minutes screen time but I must have blocked out how big of a role he had. Just painful to watch. Also Natalie Portman has zero charisma and is as wooden as she's ever been.

Obi-Wan and his master Qui-Gon(Liam Neeson)-a dignified but eccentric Jedi knight-try to settle the blockade but find themselves swept up in the conflict, teaming with an annoying cross between a Frog and a Dinosaur, Jar-Jar Binks(Ahmed Best) and the stoic ruler of Naboo, Queen Amidalia(Natalie Portman) who also has an alter ego, the handmaiden Padme'. Eventually they end up ""out of gas"" on the desert planet of Tatooine, first seen in the original STAR WARS, where they meet young Anakin Skywalker and his mother(Pernilla August). After betting on Anakin to win a race in order to get off-planet and escaping Sidious's right hand-man, Darth Maul(Ray Park), the group heads to Coruscant where the galactic authorities there can do nothing to either stop the invasion or find something to do with Anakin. So it's back to Naboo for the epic three-sided battle scene, a technique used in JEDI. The film ends with Anakin starting the journey to become a Jedi knight, and the galaxy in the hands of Palpatine. PHANTOM MENACE has a fairly interesting plot which helps set up future elements of the STAR WARS saga. However, the execution is flawed, and one can become extremely confused by it all, especially since politics were not a major part of the original STAR WARS saga. The film's acting is also so-so. While Neeson, Mcdiarmid, and some others turn in good performances, we have to deal with amateurish acting by Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, who are given pretty banal dialogue(Unfortunately, this becomes a bigger problem in the second prequel film). Others, such as Mcgregor and Jackson, are given almost nothing to do at all. Worst of all is Jar-Jar Binks, who speaks in a high-pitched, pidgin English and has such incomprehensible lines as ""You say Boom de-gasser, crashes the Boss's Heyglibber..."" and so on. The film is also loaded with tasteless scatological humor. The film's main saving grace are it's excellent action sequences, including a Pod-race on Tatooine and an epic lightsaber battle at the film's climax.

I just have a hard time relating it to the original trilogy, its just different stylisticly (maybe they did that on purpose.) For example, can you imagine Alec Guinness's Obi Won from Star Wars referencing this movie?  ""Hey Artoo, this irregularly shaped potato chip reminds me of this pink numnuts I knew named Jar Jar, we partook in adventures, had fun, got laid... it was cool.""  Doesn't sound right to me.

Almost feels as the story was written by an imbecile. And for imbeciles.<br /><br />The entire enterprise shows perfectly what happens, when the only goal of production is to maximize profit. And sell of overpriced toys.<br /><br />For me, it is mind blowing, how people can fall for this plastic toys advertising campaign. This isn't even a B-movie. It would be seriously unfair to B-movies - put this rubbish in the same category.<br /><br />On the positive side?<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />Lucas no longer directs or writes - saving us from similar experiences.",0
1705,,"I had been drawn in by the hype surrounding this movie despite the fact that I can't remember any of the other Star Wars movies and I had no idea what the story was on about. So basically, I judged this movie by itself, not comparing it with the others in the trilogy or other films. However, I must say, considering how crazy everyone was about this movie, I can imagine how many would be disappointed. I thought it was an above average sci-fi flick, but nothing I would be rushing to see again. I didn't think the plot was explained very clearly, and the dialogue was pretty lame....these days special effects alone cannot be the backbone of the movie. The humour was pretty childish as well, I think aimed more at a younger audience (but at least some mature jokes could be put in). I found Jar Jar Binks annoying and not at all funny, and Darth Maul was a joke....all that hype about the double-ended lightsabre, but apart from that, the character was pretty useless (I don't even think he spoke...)..and the fight scenes felt more like dance sequences....too slow and way too choreographed..so obviously there's plenty of room for improvements in the next two films. But on the positive side, it was quite exciting. Some people I talked to found it confusing and rather boring, but I felt that despite the length of the movie, my interest was kept throughout. And even when the film had finished, I felt like I wanted to see more...which I guess is good, but bad because it'll be a few years before I actually do. So overall, I thought it was worth the money, and it certainly did kill the curiosity I had towards all the hype. It's definitely worth watching, even if it is only for the sake of seeing it.",0
1706,4.0,"My biggest problem with this movie is that it should have been episode 2. The prequel layout should have been ep1 is what ep 2 was, ep 2 would have been some conflict in the middle of the clone wars, and ep 3 remains the same. But this is what we have instead. Before I get into the things I disliked I will mention I enjoyed a few parts of the movie. As always the music was phenomenal. The other 2 major stand outs being the pod race and the final lightsaber fight, considering they were the only 2 gripping parts of the film. Every performance with maybe qui gons as an exception was bland and dull. The visuals are unique, but not in the best way. They are good for the time, but it is stupidly obvious when they are using a green screen. There were some good ideas, mainly in the forms of characters in the film, and there was some bad stuff, like boring plot points and very slow boring pacing for a space fantasy involving laser sword wielding space wizards and robot army's. Overall this film really should have been episode 2, but with what we got I was not really satisfied and wanted a more engaging story.",0
1707,10.0,"So far a lot of reviews have said that a lot of this movie is a lot of mere eye-candy. To me it was that and much more. If this was made in 1977, it wouldn't have been as big of a hit as would be now. But since we love the classics so much, we didn't mind waiting in line for 2 hours or 10 minutes, whatever! It was a good film, and much like other people, I loved the pod-race. It kicked ass. Damn Sand People, ha ha. Jar-Jar and the two headed announcer weren't as bad as people said. Jar-Jar had some funny lines and the announcer was almost as real as those guys on NASCAR races or whatever. Coruscant was an awesome city, so was the under water world. The ending seemed much like A New Hope, no metals, but it was generally happy and a kick-ass party. (Not giving much away there). Now you're probably saying: jeez is there anything you didn't like about the movie? Well, yeah. No Vader and no Solo. Darth Sidious and Darth Maul were cool bad guys, Maul was too quiet he needed to say something. Sidious has a mystery behind him. Who is he? What are his motives? What's he after? Questions to be answered in the next 2 films. C3PO didn't get much time, but he wasn't as emotional as the other movies. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor worked well together. Jake Lloyd is ok for someone who's only 10 years old. Natalie Portman did a good job, but it seemed her accent changed a little too much. For Me: 4 Stars. 2 Thumbs up. 9.5 outta 10. Great Movie. Thank-you George for yet another chapter in Star Wars!",1
1708,10.0,"I've read through a lot of reviews here and I gotta ask what film you people were seeing? I've seen it four times and while the first was exciting beyond belief, the 3 following times were just as fun. This was a good film. Not as good as The Empire Strikes Back, but better than Jedi. I mean the film is good. Here are the things I like the Most about the Film: 1. Qui-Gon Jinn. This guy was awesome. 2. Queen Amidala, She had the same kind of strength and determination as Princesses Leia did in the orginials. 3. Special Effects. God, they were good. Much like A New Hope, Lucas Film Ltd. and ILM has set a new standard in Special Effects. 4. Darth Maul. Unlike Vader, you could see his facial expressions that made him look more evil. This guy would whoop Vader's ass in a lightsaber duel. 5. Pod Race. The Noise pollution was great in this part of the film. 6. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I could swear that was just a computer enhanced Alec Guinness at times. hehe. 7. The Queen's Captain. That guy was awesome too. Who ever he was, was probably the best actor in this movie. He showed concern for the Queen and gave his opinion forcefully. 8. Darth Sidious. Ok, we don't know who he is yet, but hey he had the voice of the Dark Side. 9. Battle Droids. Great Idea, why doesn't the emperor save time and money in the orginals and use battle droids? 10. Watto, he had some great lines and was generally cool. 11. Gungan City. How could such a dippy race have such a cool city. 12. There's gonna be 2 more after this one. Lucas has said that he made this one light hearted, because the next two are gonna be rather dark. 13. C3PO. Ok, in this movie he was the best. ""I find that Jar-Jar to be quite odd in deed."" One of the best lines in the movie. 14. Senator Palpatine talking to Anakin. ""And you young Skywalker, we will watch your career with great interest."" Yep, you bet. 5 things I hated in this movie, just like the orginial 3 there were sucky moments. 1. Anakin's mom. Bleh. Over actress. Terrible job and terrible dialog. 2. Jar-Jar Binks. An inappropriate character for this movie. but wow did he look real. Not as bad as Anakin's Mom. 3. The Gungan-Battle Droid fight. Still better than the Ewok-Stormtropper fight, more believeable too. 4. Miti-clorains? A scientific way to tell if the force is with them, what's with this? 5. No Han Solo. I know he's not even born yet, but man Han was awesome in the other three.",1

1713,,"The most common complaint about this movie seems to be that it didn't live up to the original.  I get the impression that a lot of these comments come from people who first saw them on video and had the benefit of being able to watch the trilogy back to back.  I remember when Star Wars (nobody called it ""A New Hope"") first came out. Everybody I knew thought Luke was a whiny little pipsqueak.  Chewie annoyed us.  Lea was hot.  Han was cool.  Vader scared the poo-doo out of us.  C-3PO and R2-D2 were funny.  Before ""Empire"" came out, rumors were flying that Luke and Han would be killed on Hoth.  We all thought that would be sad, but would run with it.  Not to wax too ""back in my day"", but when we saw a movie, someone was telling us a story.  Now everyone wants a say in the story.  I'm no fan of Jar-Jar but I can appreciate his place in the story.  My biggest gripe is that his dialogue was written by Mike Myers for Waynes World ie. ""esqueeze me"". I thought Phantom Menace was a great Sci-Fi fantasy movie and it gives a lot of insight into some of the stock characters from the first trilogy. I've lived my life as a huge Star Wars buff.  But I will admit that most of the acting and writing in the first three films sucks if you watch it like you're watching The Godfather.  These are fun, fantasy, comic book style movies.  And as far as the CGI characters, how stupid would people in battle droid costumes looked?  Or the Gungans for that matter?  At least now, all the aliens don't have to look like humans with bigger heads and mouths",1
1714,7.0,"Episode I was just what I expected it would be; the beginning.  I know there are several out there who condemn Episode I because it did not live up to the first three installments.  I agree.  It was not even close to being as epic as the other three.  But you have to remind yourself, the first three was years after Episode I.  Star Wars is a story from a book.  The first chapter is almost always spent introducing characters and developing scenes and plot.  Take, for example Tolken's ""The Hobbit"".  The first couple chapters, some would say, bore us with so many names and events, its overwhelming.  But that is what makes it worth while in the end.  Which is what we have all already experienced with Episodes IV, V and VI.  However, Episode I seems complex due to the fact that, because of the first three, there are several unanswered questions and one gets the feeling Lucas is cranking this one out to start on Episode II.",1
1715,,"Having been a huge Star Wars fan since a child, I was thrilled when Phantom Menace came out.  I saw it 4 times in the theater and loved it just the same.  But with Episode II almost in theaters, I feel a need to defend Episode I.  It was very different from the original trilogy with a variety of new elements.  Episode I showed children for the first time in the entire series, something I don't think many fans realized.  Jake Lloyd did the best he could with the character that was meant to act like goofy kid and not a lifeless slave.  Yes, the midiclorian-thing is rubbish and Jar Jar is the worst thing to ever happen in the series, but if you look past that, you'll see that Phantom Menace was a pretty good movie.  I think hype is what killed it.  I've noticed the hype around Ep. II is pretty subdued compared to Ep. I, and that's a good thing.  ",1

O.K, maybe it seemed just a bit too ""kiddified"" and some of the little plot twists were rather contrived. As well, none of the characters had the screen presence of a Han Solo or A Princess Leia. But on the whole it was a pretty good film. It did not lack a plot as a number of other folks have claimed, but in my opinion had no more nor less plot than any of the other films in the series. Try and keep in mind that this is ONLY Star Wars, not Shakespeare in space. It's really only supposed to be fun and entertaining, not a life changing experience.

This new Star Wars movie was in my opinion a ""fundamentally"" bad piece of film making.  Special effects...Yatta yatta...In 1999 they should be good.  If you go into this movie as I did, with the love of classic movies in mind (Story, script, acting) you will be very disappointed.  If on the other hand you are say from the ""MTV"" generation, you may love the flashy ""Muppet show"" it has become.  I work for a company that does special effects, so I appreciate nice graphics like everyone else. However when the integrity of a movie goes down, and you lose a certain human element, that's where I draw the line.  To close, I left the theatre very angry with a feeling of being cheated.

An entertaining movie, to be sure, but it is not too much more than that. Terrific special effects (especially in the scenes showing the completely urbanized planet and the one involving the speeder race with young Anikan) and the great fight scene with Darth Maul are the highlights of this not-bad motion picture. You will probably stay alert right to the end, which is definitely saying something, but there's a lot to be endured: the interesting characters of the first series are not there, the acting generally ranges from flat to poor, and the story is more or less forgettable. The very talented Samuel L. Jackson will probably be happy to tell his grandchildren about the seven lines he spoke in Star Wars, but many of us in the present would have liked to see more of him. And, of course, Jar-Jar Binks is just plain irritating and won't go away no matter how hard you wish.

First things first, what's so bloody important about Naboo? This is never explained. Not even die-hard fans know this, George. The least you could do was tell us.

Suprisingly, he's not as irritating as people make out. The Gungan Leader (Brian ""Shout in funny accent"" Blessed) was for me, the most teeth-gnashingly irritating guy on the block.

I can only give the latter category a marginal recommendation on this. Sure, all the technical elements are there for special effects, but there's less of a good story in this one. The origin story of this whole new trilogy is only going to appeal to the fanatics. The fact that Lucas held off on this one because he wanted to wait for advanced computer effects tells me where his heart is. This film is more upbeat than THE MATRIX, but both films comment on today's society that is so impersonal and only wants to provide you with the best technology can offer as a way to avoid personal interaction. While MATRIX conveys this message within the film, MENACE conveys this message in the sense that there are no strong characters with traits you remember after it's over.

1740,6.0,"Sadly, due to recent Disney products, the Star Wars prequel movies seem to be getting off easy. I wish I could tell you these movies are as good as people say they are and want them to be, but it's just not possible. These movies are just so bad. Starting with the Phantom Menace, the best thing I can say about this movie is that Liam Neeson is trying his absolute best. The best characters in the movie are Qui-Gon-Jinn and Darth Maul, and the fight near the end of the movie is something I occasionally just watch on YouTube because it's so good. But truly, from multiple watches, the rest of this dumb movie is deplorable. On the acting standpoint, nobody is at the top of their game, the child actor of this movie sounds miserably bored, and don't get me started on Jar Jar Binks. Do you really, really believe that Star Wars would be better in the hands of George Lucas again? He came up with that character. He made this movie. He went back and messed with the original trilogy when it didn't even need to be messed with, simply because he was too fascinated with CGI to even consider that it wouldn't age well in about 10, even 5 years. I haven't yet mentioned the writing, because more often than not even when it's corny I can take it to a certain extent, which is why the dialogue in this movie didn't sour me to my core. Actually, some of the writing in the movie itself is quite clever and fun, many of the quips are good and welcome, and the writing never makes the cardinal sin of interrupting action sequences. Imagine just how bad the final battle would be if they kept interrupting it with quips between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon! Thank god they didn't do that, which really helped make that final battle worth suffering the rest of this movie. If I had lower standards, I'd say the final act of this movie saves the entire movie. As well executed as it was, though, I can't be that kind to this movie. It gets dumb, like, ""this is a movie made for kids"" dumb, something which goes against the entire idea that Star Wars is a series made for everyone. Beyond that, any other points I give this movie are because even with all these problems I find that this movie has got a lot of charm. It's fun, despite the excessively annoying parts, and the style is blatantly obvious from start to finish. This is a George Lucas movie. That is what you have come to see. It's pretty at points, it's tense, it's exciting and it's gripping, Qui-Gon's death still gets me emotional, yet despite the great things this movie accomplishes I still can't get over how much it gets wrong.

Lucas was coming back to Star Wars. Man I wish he hadn't, as these new installments just didn't have it. Lucas has directed, produced and/or created some great films: Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire Strikes Back, but he has also produced some real lemons: Howard the Duck, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Unfortunately, The Phantom Menace fits comfortably in this later category. Further it opened the door for all kinds of ridicules alterations in the original Star Wars and its sequels.

I mean, Lucas was pointing that he waited almost 20 years to film another chapter because he needed visuals not possible in those days. Why is then that after watching The Phantom Menace I had the feeling that this one is so much beneath the previous trilogy (including the effects). Don´t get me wrong, CGI done here are correct, but that´s mostly it - correct. That´s just not good enough for the Star Wars. Previous movies with five times lower budget took us to the most beautiful, imaginary, challenging and powerful places. The Phantom Menace did no such thing. Now let´s come to the story. I think that it´s a big lie that Lucas wrote all six chapters at once. It just can´t be true, ´cause quality´s fall is more than obvious. Mr.Lucas is, let´s face it, not any more full of flashy imagination that we loved so much. I mean, The Phantom Menace isn´t a bad film at all. It has a very unique moments and a story that holds on it´s own, but that´s it. I hope that, in some way, I was wrong and that time will show me the real importance of The Phantom Menace. I really do.",1

That, for some reason, is just not the case.  Like ""The Godfather Part III,"" ""The Phantom Menace"" fails to capture the visceral quality of its predecessors.  Hey, that's putting nicely.  These directors have lost it, big time.  What really stuns me is that they both forgot their roots as young filmmakers who knew that the magic of fresh and exciting narrative was more powerful than all the special effects and sounds one could muster. Watching ""The Phantom Menace,"" I had the same feeling as watching ""The Godfather Part III"" for the first time-incredible disappointment.

And, to tell you the truth, the only reason I saw this one was because my nine-year-old brother wasn't allowed to see it and I wanted to make him jealous. But then I ended up tacking a poster of Anakin Skywalker to my door and buying the movie novelization of this. Why? Because it turned out to be a decent movie after all! Jake Lloyd is what makes this movie good. That kid is so cute and irresistably charming. It's sad to think that Anakin will grow up to be Darth Vader. I didn't exactly get WHY this movie was happening but I guess I did get the general plot. ANAKIN! ANAKIN! ANAKIN! Go Anakin! I LOVE that kid. I hope he returns for episodes 2 and 3. And Jar Jar was, um, an interesting character, although I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. I guess I would give this movie two and a half stars out of four. Of course, based on Jake Lloyd's performance I would probably give that a three and a half out of four. So, see this movie if ya want some entertainment. It's very decent, and even if you don't like STAR WARS you might find this enjoyable. I don't think kids aged nine and under would really understand it, but there is nothing inappropriate. The only things little kids would like about it would probably be the lightsabers and the fights and the funny computer-animated characters. But, anyway, I recommend this to, well, anyone, basically.

However, even as a child, once I learned of the complicated episode order and saw the originals and the then-new Attack of the Clones, Episode I always stuck out as the weakest link, a sentiment that had remained with me throughout the completion of the prequels and even as an adult watching the polarizing sequels.

1787,5.0,"The Phantom Menace is after all, a Star Wars movie. However, you can't ignore its many problems. The movie feels like it doesn't know where it has to go 95% of the time. It feels like the plot is lost and has no point that it has to reach by the end. Other problems in the movie are stock characters that play no extra part in the plot, other than make it seem more lost. The pacing is alright, but still doesn't save the messed up plot that cannot decide whether to focus on Anakin Skywalker, or the Gungans. Most of the dialogue also feels clanky and forced, or sometimes out of context. There are some good points, however. For example, the amazingly choreographed duel at the end of the movie, and the spectacular score by John Williams. The cast is mostly mediocre, with only Liam Neeson clearly standing out. All in all, ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" is a goofy beginning to what should've been the best origin story of all time, but at times stands tall with a few good scenes.",0

Every generation needs myths but even myths should be coherent. There are lot of good small sci fi movies that came out in the period of the first trilogy (Silent Running, Blade Runner, Alien come to mind), which provide the homage and class to the dark prescience displayed by the best of this genre. This movie is pure fantasy, propelled by pretentious moral overtones and special effects overdone to point of pure monotony. An earlier reviewer proposed this film should be viewed as an old Saturday Matinee Serial, with a complete suspension of belief, but even the Republic Serials had a tongue in cheek, self deprecating humour and irony about them. That's all lost in the sheer pompous self delusion of this movie.

1813,5.0,"The Phantom Menace is the worst movie ever. Well... not really, but as a Star Wars fan it surely was a disappointment. After Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi my expectations were incredibly high. I could only imagine something similar to the original trilogy but with better special effects, costumes and plot. Afterall, George Lucas had over a decade to prepare for this movie.<br /><br />While reading what the plot summary beforehand it mentions Anakin Skywalker's backstory, an invasion of Naboo, the padawan Obi-Wan (We know him!) and his Jedi master Qui-Gon, the deadly Darth Maul and an exciting Podrace on Tatooine (Luke Skywalker's home planet). Already after reading this plot summary we have multiple connections to the original trilogy including Obi-Wan, Tatooine and how Anakin became Darth Vader. Plus an invasion, a formidable opponent in Darth Maul and a Podrace. The possibilities for this film and endless and exciting. (Spoilers start after this paragraph)<br /><br />First let's talk about what George Lucas did well, although it wasn't much there were certainly good parts of the movie. The first is Anakin's backstory, we learn he is from Tatooine and how he escaped slavery and was taken in by the Jedi's. It could have been overall more exciting but it set up the next movies perfectly to really learn about how he turned to the dark side, which is what everyone wants to know (Anakin did call a lightsaber a light sword so that was disappointing). The other part of the film that was done well was the Podrace. The race was entertaining from start to finish and with everything that was riding on it, it certainly made it exciting. That scene was my favorite of the film.<br /><br />Another surprisingly solid part of the movie were the actors. In 2020, Liam Neeson and action movies go hand in hand but pre-2000 that wasn't the case. Movies he'd been doing before 1999 included Les Miserables (1998) and Schindler's List (1993) and seeing him in that role while knowing him as the action star he is today was very cool. Also seeing an actor like Samuel L. Jackson a nice surprise. Although he didn't have much screen time it is assumed he will have more screen time in films to come. Finally Natalie Portman was fantastic in the film. Although the script was tough and not very exciting she did a great job with what she had. Especially when we thought she was just a handmaiden but was actually the queen, that was a fun revelation. Overall, the actors were good but they weren't utilized as well as they could have been in the film.<br /><br />Next onto the bad. The invasion of Naboo: boring. We go from identical looking stormtrooper in Episodes IV,V and VI to identical looking droids in Episode I. I'm not saying they needed more but c'mon, they drive around in rust colored ships and talk in monotone voices. I expected more. Next, the deadly Darth Maul. Wow that sounds exciting, he's got a cool name, he's deadly, could he be the next Darth Vader like villian with an appearance over Episodes I, II, III? The answer is no. Although the fight scenes between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Maul wasn't horrible, I was expecting more. How does does Darth Maul fend off two trained jedis, kill Qui-Gon but then get killed by a flipping padawan Obi-Wan? Only George Lucas know. The editing during the end of that scene was also atrocious. While Obi-Wan was hanging, he used the force to jump back up and grab Qui-Gon's lightsaber to kill Darth Maul and the whole time that was happening Darth Maul was just watching. He didn't react apart from a cheesy look on his face and then he was struck down.<br /><br />Next the horrible costumes and borderline unbearable species. With 16 years between Episode VI and The Phantom Menace I was expecting cool, scary and good looking creatures but instead we got a super edited Jabba the Hutt, the Gungans and ""intimidating"" Neimoidians. The Gungans might be the most annoying species in the galaxy. Everytime Jar-Jar entered the screen I got threatened to turn the movie off. He was clumsy, couldn't talk but somehow his mistakes never ended up being too bad. The way he walked and his careless attitude bothered me but don't even get me started about his speech. As the Gungans would say ""mesa no likey"". Even their leader couldn't talk and he shook his mouth in a poorly edited way. Finally the fish like, blob like, noseless Trade Federation Neimoidians were supposed to be ruthless, scary and intimidating but that goal was far from achieved.<br /><br />Finally the disappointing plot. This movie had the possibility to be fantastic and only continue to increase the Star Wars fame after the fantastic original trilogy but it simply did not happen. One key part they skipped over in the summary of the movie was the trade federation. I can understand wanting to include some things about the politics in the intergalactic world but this was just far too much. Most people and especially kids do not care so much for the tedious details about trade. They had endless possibilities to spin this movie into a fantastic one but got bogged down on focusing too much on the policies and politics relating to the trade federation.<br /><br />Some people will tell you to skip Episodes I, II and III in the Star Wars series and they have justifiable reasons. Poor editing, directing, script, costumes and characters is a lot to simply look over and forget about while watching the movie. There is much that could have gone better whether it was a better script, different plot or different characters but after all it is a Star Wars movie. If you are a true Star Wars fan, Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a must see.",0

1815,7.0,"Just recently rewatched this film, inspired by CinemaWins, and found lots of good things in it. I love it when people care about the work they do, and The Phantom Menace has many instances of that. So much effort went into music, sound design, casting, CGI, costumes - in fact, if you divorce it from the dialogue, the acting is mostly spot on. (Except for the painful dinner scene on Tatooine, no one was good in it). I was one of those people who watched the prequels before the Original Trilogy and to me Obi Wan Kenobi will always be Ewan McGregor first and Alec Guinness second. First impressions work like that. Liam Neeson managed to create this mystic, this eccentric Jedi who's more of a priest than a warrior. The fact that I understood what kind of a character he was back when I knew precious little about acting - or warrior monks - tells me he did a good job. Ian McDiarmind is so much fun to watch in every scene he's in. Natalie Portman's Padme is an awkward teenager, as I now realise she should be (she's what, fourteen?), and Pernilla August's Shmi Skywalker is the perfect selfless mother of a messiah.",0

There are very few movies released at this time of year that live up to the hype. Star Wars Episode I is no exception to that rule but it does have a lot of redeeming features. Anyone with half a brain knew this film would have a weaker storyline than Episodes IV, V and VI otherwise this one would have been made in 1977, not Episode IV. The reason is that the main characters are Jedi, not the most interesting people in the universe, until they start fighting that is. So with no Han Solo character, this really is just a scene setter and should not really be looked at as anything else. Having said that the Special Effects are simply mind blowing. I don't think most people realise just how much of this movie is actually composited and it's certainly the best example of how it can be done well. It's a shoo-in for the Effects Oscar, only the Matrix provides any competition to it and in any other year the Matrix would have won it. But while Jar Jar is annoying at first, I stopped noticing it after a while. The performances are pretty good even though the roles were not too demanding. I am surprised that more was not made of Hugh Quarshie's role as Captain Panaka or Steven Speirs as Captain Tarpals these two seemed the only ones with good potential as characters. I'll admit to some confusion over the dual role of Amidala and Padme, which was which when? A far from perfect film that is let down in the first half but redeemed in the second half. From the Pod Race onwards it's excellent for all ages. Before that it's a little dull, the timing is off. Perhaps George Lucas could have left the Directorial duties to someone who has directed more recently?",0
1818,10.0,"If, like me you were born around the time of the third Star Wars movie, which was the original(Huh?), I don't think it is then fair for you to make a judgement until you see it again, and again, and again. We grew up on these movies, we would've been to young at the time to form any opinion, and so any opinion we(or at least I) have is from repeated viewings. I grew to love the first ones. I'm sure I will feel the same with this one. Besides, It's still better than any other movie since possibly ""Braveheart"". Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd are absolutely wonderful, as is the rest of the cast...even Jar Jar grew on me. As to the racist ""accents"" and stereotypes; I noticed more than just asian accents thank you very much, why must all alien species speak with American, English, or Australian accents anyway?To think everyone speaks in the same tongue is ludicrous, but I suppose more subtitles might've been better. Before I go, make sure you look at the young Greedo in the Pod Race scene, it's very amusing. SO STOP YOUR WHINING",1
1819,7.0,OK. Perhaps I'm chiming in too early as I've only seen it once. But here's how I felt -up and down the whole time. For every great thing I had a reservation.,1
1820,10.0,"Honestly, despite some flawed conceptions such as taking a comical approach, trying to inject comedy here and there (if it actually worked, I would'nt be complaining) and a horrible character addition called Jar Jar St/Binks for supposed comic relief, this movie is no where as bad as people try to portray. As a matter of fact, its nothing less than fantastic. You'd have thunk that the creators and writers ran out of ideas by this time but they've actually come up with plenty of new ones. All of the usual Star Wars material and charm is present in quantity enough to satisfy any Star Wars fan so I really don't realise where all the rants stem from? The battle sequences were at least way better than in the LoTR.",0
1821,,"George Lucas is an evil genius.  For 16 years, my vision of Star Wars has been Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and all the rest.  I will admit that when I saw The Phantom Menace, I was a little confused by it, but I nonetheless, enjoyed the movie.  I saw it once more and came out with the following feeling: THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!  But I had to see it twice in order to understand the fact that this is our new Star Wars trilogy.  Lucas is laughing at this fact all the way to the bank.  My advice, is that if you're a big SW fan, go see the movie once more.  I promise, most of you will see the movie in an entirely different perspective.  You've seen it once and you now know what to expect.  I found that the unfolding of the story was rather intriguing and I'm dying to know how things unfold in the next 2 episodes.",1
1822,2.0,"I would just like to apoligize to those of you who read my first review of this movie. I was under the influence of a Star Wars high, that rampant lie was the result. I have seen Episode1 since then and be rest assured, I've changed my vote from a 9 to a 2. I guess it was just me going, LOOK! Pretty special effects!!!. I've now come to realize that cool sfx alone certainly don't make a real Star Wars movie. The origional trilogy had so much more than just SFX, which is why they're still great today when the effects are dated.",1
1823,2.0,"Ok, first off I must admit I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and have been since I saw A New Hope. However I also have a hobby of giving movie reviews, so just before the movie started I forced myself to consider this just a normal movie until I'd seen it. With all the mixed reviews that have been thrown around in the last couple of weeks I got pretty nervous that Phanton Mennace would suck. Fortunately it definitely did not. Lets start with the best part of the movie and I hate to repeat what everyone else has already said but I will, the special effects. Visually this movie is nothing less than spectacular, the underwater scene was stunning, the lightsaber battle at the end was the best one yet, the pod race was one of the coolest things I have ever seen in my life (even people who hated the movie liked that part), the creatures were seamless, and the ships were overwhelming. Lucas and ILM didn't leave out any details no matter how small, the shadows, the light coming from different angles, the chrome on shiny ships, take a look it's all there. Everyone always cuts down on the acting but I didn't think it was bad at all, Neeson was really good as usual, McGreggor was playing a very different role than he's used to but he still did a good job, Portman was great, she was one of the big highlights of the film, Lloyd wasn't as bad as people made him out to be, I mean come on people, the kid's only eight how good do you expect him to be? The plot seemed a little bit weird considering the whole thing was about trade taxation, doesn't really seem like a star wars plot does it? But I'm pretty confident that everything will get straightened out in the next two films. My biggest complaint about the movie was a floppy eared alien named Jar Jar Binks, this character was just flat out stupid, I really think he should have been left out of the picture entirely, I couldn't believe that Lucas would throw in a character that bad just for a few laughs from his 6 year old audience. Another smaller flaw in the movie was the incredible luck all the characters had, when they're underwater a big fish attacks them and a bigger fish eats it, then they get attacked again and the same fish eats the second one. Also there's a part where Jar Jar Binks gets his foot attached to the wires of a downed attack droid and when he tries to shake it off the blaster in the dead droid's hands goes off three times killing three more droids, I wish that one of those shots had hit Jar Jar right in his stupid looking face, god I hate that guy. All in all it was definitely a very entertaining movie with all the charm of the original three and with cool new special effects to boot. On a scale of 1 to 10 if Jar Jar binks hadn't been in it I would have given it a 10 but because of that clumsy freak I give it a 9.",0
1824,7.0,"To produce a cultural icon requires a unique combination of talent, drive and resources. I feel that even when someone possesses these, that person may only be entitiled to one cultural icon per lifetime. Phantom Menace helps prove this point. It simply does not have the enduring qualities of the first three films. Characters are not developed, dialog is strained and while the CGI effects are striking, you're left with the impression that George was trying just a little too hard to compensate for the lack of story. Where is the amusing banter between C3PO and R2D2, or the Han-Leia sexual tension, or even Luke's laughable whining?",0

The acting was alright for the most part, except for Anakin.  I didn't find that boy suited the role at all.  And Jar-Jar... what was that all about?  It was like Lucas knew that a bunch of kids would be watching, so put an irrelevant character in for comic relief.  How annoying.  I hope the next movie is more clear cut with a better storyline and a better Anakin Skywalker.",0
1828,7.0,"First off, i'd like to say that the main reason I think people disliked this movie so much is because it had to follow up the original trilogy, and that's like putting the monkees on stage after you've just seen the beatles. You just wanna go home. Compared to the originals, I can see why this was a letdown for most fans. There were a lot of politicians and quiet meetings that were a total snooze-fest, but the only reason we didn't see this in the original trilogy is because the senate no longer exists. If you can get past the politics and Jar-Jar, it's a very good movie. The choreography on the lightsaber battles was incredible, and the battle droids were great. The effects were mind blowing, and the podrace was incredible. It showed us more into the world of star wars, and that's all I could have asked for.",1
1829,3.0,"I am not going to argue that the first trilogy to be released (of which the Empire Strikes Back was the best) was fully adult fare. However, there were relationship sensibilities and plot and dialogue that that were engaging to even someone over twenty. Most importantly, the characters had weight and there was a sense that the events portrayed came from a rich historical background.",1
1830,6.0,"I was 17 when I saw Star Wars in May of 1977.  With the promise of the continuation of the series in Sequel and Prequel form over the next 20 or so years, you can imagine my disapointment of the possibility of Return being the last.  When the prequel was announced I was still excited despite my advancing age and different priorities.  When I finally sat down last July in front of the screen, I was just awed by the level of technology that was brought into the movie.  The characters and acting was terrific, the effects were just amazing.  Yet at the end of the movie I felt left wanting.  There was no closure to this ""installment.""  The movie by itself didn't feel complete, that it depended on the succeeding sequels to make it work.  I was gratified yet disapointed.  I guess we'll what the future and George brings to the ""franchise.""",1
1831,6.0,"The Phantom Menace was undoubtably the most hyped up movie of all time after the original trilogy ended and did it, in my personal opinion yes and no. The Phantom Menace has a lot of strength in my opinion first of all I think Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor we're both great as Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi, the sets where great and the world was interesting, the film is well paced, and the final lightsaber fight without a doubt one of the best in the saga with duel of the fates being a fantastic score to add the epic intensity of it. However I can't turn a blind eye on its flaws first of all Padme is not that interesting as a character and this is an a problem with just this movie it's a problem with the whole prequel trilogy as a whole, the second problem is Jar Jar who is mixed when it comes to humor and in the end doesn't feel that a Star Wars character unfortunately, and last but not least Jake Lloyd is Anakin is to put it bluntly not good however I don't approve the bullying he got as a kid but I feel like definitely without a doubt Lucas should've hired either someone who good at directing children or cast somebody older as Anakin. In the end The Phantom Menace for me is just ok with a lot of great moments however the film has flaws that I can't ignore but hey it's not the worst Star Wars movie. Overall grade: B-",0
1832,7.0,"George Lucas is one of my favorites directors, he works perfectly on everything, the construction of the places, characters like Darth Maul, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, all of them have a story line. Anakin being a slave is brilliant to the concistent of his future, all of it is perfect, but the movies takes too much to develop everything that he could do in one hour and a half. I really think this movie would be brilliant, but it took so long to get to the point, making other things happen that didn't need to be in the movie.",1

It couldn't have been worse, could it?  Why didn't Liam Neeson do that weird fading thing ObiWan does in episode 3?  Is there any logic to this stuff at all?  I am seriously doubting it.

So many people I have/had respect for said the movie was atrocosious, but I didn't believe anyone could do harm to the franchise. I believed the haters went in expecting to be blown away and because they didn't leave the theater with that euphoric feeling they had after episodes 4,5 and 6 a void was created and then was filled with anger. Because of this furious uproar I received from my associates, I innocently bought my ticket with low expectations. I definitely should've left feeling I got the upperhand on the matinée fee I paid.",0
1838,,"The Phantom Menace is really disappointing. It totally lacks the mythic sense of the 'first' three movies. In those films, the special effects rode on the characters' backs. Here, instead, the special effects are meant to awe us and draw us away from the lack of a strong mythos.",0

Jar Jar Binks is not really bad as I thought, but exaggerated a bit and the Gungans are better than Ewoks though.",0

Even dumber, the same planet! What a rip off of the first movie. But as far as I know, it is probably not a rip off of a Nazi propaganda film, but it pokes jabs at Republicans.

FAR too much graphics and not enough effort was put into Phantom Menace, this film loses a great deal of the original loveable Star Wars. Though still enjoyable, and a must see for fans of the series, it is in no way a match for the original trilogy.",0
1858,,"First off, the Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars film. There, I've said it. However, that doesn't necessarily make it bad. In comparison to the original trilogy, all classics, and a movie that should prove to be a classic, Episode II, most movies do pale. However, that doesn't mean the movie doesn't have redeeming features. It just means that the movie is at a level where we have to point out its redeeming features, if you follow. When I first saw this movie, I was bowled away by the special effects, ideas, locations, and yes, the acting. Liam Neeson's and Ewan McGregor's performances were exceptional, and there were other fantastic bits of acting from Natalie Portman, Terence Stamp, and Ian McDiarmid. Indeed, there were only two real slackers in the cast, but here is where the real problem is. Jake Lloyd does not do a good job portraying Anakin. Although he does somewhat capture the precocity of a gifted nine-year-old (having lived with one, I know), it mainly comes off as bad acting. Plus, the ""romance"" they are trying to create is misplaced. With Portman and Hayden Christensen in Episode II it works because it is believable. Here it comes off as stupid. A nine year old and a fourteen year old? Please. It isn't helped by the fact Portman looks far older than fourteen. Jar Jar is also a problem. I don't find him as annoying as others, but I can see where people would hate him. In Episode II he works well as a bit player, but as a costar in Episode I he can get aggravating very quickly. In the end Episode I is a must for Star Wars fans, if not ""crazed"" ones. It works best for casual fans as an introduction to the series, not as the first entry into one of the most popular series of all time after almost 20 years. Keep an open mind and you'll love it. Expect a movie of the caliber of The Empire Strikes Back and you will be doomed from the start.",0

The reason I love Star Wars so much is that the films don't care about the standards of the time, they just aim to please, and for me I couldn't be anymore pleased with the entire series. What did you people expect? Star Wars was so built up over time that you just forgot that they are only movies, never to be taken seriously! I don't believe the world I live in anymore! Hypocrites! Don't act so mature and watch the movies not as critics but as fans, and you'll enjoy them maybe like you never have before. Phantom is just like originals, embrace it, the originals were to masterpieces of filmmaking, they were masterpieces of pop culture, and Phantom should've been part of it, if you idiots hadn't overanalyzed it to death.

1868,,"Ah, Episode 1.  It was just a year ago, now, that I gained word of this film, the new ""Lucas Extravaganza"" that was coming out. Oh, how I longed for a film that could somehow outdo the other three combined in special effects, and have plenty of room left for action, romance, drama, nasty space beasts, you name it.  Well, I'm somewhat proud to report that, although this film nowhere near followed along the same action/adventure path as the other three films, it still had it's share of thrills, spills, and quite a number of hair raising scenes. It was somewhat unfortunate that Lucas chose not to create so many nasty and and hideous beasts as in the first movie; the creatures at the cantina in this movie seemed a lot more goofy than threatening.  Much of this film's dialogue was rather banal and innefective.  Liam Neeson was decent in his role, but even his performance was somehow subdued by the barrage of special effects blasting out of the screen.  The one suprise of the movie was that Jake Lloyd, the lad playing Anakin Skywalker, actually pulled off the best performance among the whole lot of them.  Shows you what budding talent can do, hmmm? I was satisfied, overall, you better bet I was, but oh, the Sabre scenes.... Yes, the Lightsaber fights in this movie were perhaps the best out of all four movies combined, with a little split suprise at the end..... As I watched the film, I found myself drifting back to other movies, sci-fi films from the Nineties, and I began to rate this movie up alongside those films.  Certainly, Star Wars is heads and tails above even the colossal Jurrasic Park in the special effects department.  It's creation and bending of reality allows us to see things, as if we are looking into some bizarre dream.  Truly a halluciogenic quality.  Unfortunate that the same humanity and drama as carried out in movies like jurassic park wasn't included in The Phantom Menace.",1

Lucas and his crew spent hundreds of Million to prove that computer graphics still aren't as lifelike as shooting real-life miniature models on film (like the other films). 4-Jar Jar 5-I STILL don't have a real good grasp of what the hell is going on 6-75% of the film seemed to be a Pod race 7-Anakin making C3PO is hokey 8-The force being something of a microbe, a physical entity in the body, blows it for me.  I liked to think of it as a sort of Zen-like concept, an Eastern-religion feel.  Let go of your normal consciousness and let ""the force"" take over.  It was mystical, supernatural.  Now it is a bacteria. Not quite as romantic.",1

1875,7.0,"Although I loved the movie, it did fail me in several key areas: (1) Jar Jar. You know the contraversy. I don't care if he IS gay, he's annoying, unneeded, and generally just a waste of CGI. He serves as little more than (weak) comic relief and by the end I was hoping he'd die. (2) The fight scenes, although well done, were shot WAY too closely. I'd would have liked to have seen a little more of the action from a distance so I could see what was going on. (3) The miracles of Anakin. No spoilers, but he pulls a one in a million shot that could have been done different and more realistic.",0
1876,3.0,"I have to agree with all the negative comments. What a huge disappointment. It felt like Lucas shot the very first draft of his script. Ewan, Liam and Samuel are GREAT actors, but they all stink in this. The editing stinks. The FX are very good, but never great. Sorry, but the pod race looks like a model pod hanging in front of blurry brown & tan CGI backgrounds, and the final battle never feels real: the sky is too blue, the grass is too green, and the bots are too clean. The film's biggest crime, though, is leaving Obi Wan on that spaceship with nothing to do, especially when you've got Ewan playing him. One big question: in the original 3 films, why didn't R2 know that Darth, aka Annakin, was his creator? Is it even hinted at? And why does the final saber fight take place in what looks like a huge death star? And is it true that an angry, disillusioned Jar Jar will turn to the dark side and call himself Boba Fett? That was a joke, not a spoiler.",0

1878,1.0,"As the Star Wars saga continues, each succeeding film has gotten more and more overblown with special effects and less and less concerned with plot and storytelling.

1880,9.0,I think that the only bad thing about the Phantom Menace is that Darth Maul and Qui Gon died in the same scene. I just think that Locus should've saved Maul for Episode 2 and had Dooku fight Qui Gon and Kenobi. I know that Dooku was a jedi in The Phantom Menace and fell to Dark Side between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.,0
1881,7.0,"When I remembered Stars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace I thought of an annoying character named Jar Jar Binks and the famous Pod Race sequence. I did not like the character Jar Jar, but loved the Pod Race sequence. Now I have re-watched Phantom Menace and I must say I am mildly impressed. The special effects are better then I remembered them(Jar Jar Binks, end battle, pod race, etc.), but more importantly there actually was a good story here and the acting may have been the best in the prequel trilogy(except for Ian Mcdiarmid's splendid job in Revenge of the Sith). Liam Neeson portrayed the Jedi night Qui Gon with ease and Ewan Mcgregor looked more comfortable in this movie then the following two. Now the main complaints about acting come from people talking about Jake Llyod, which is understandable because he can get under your nerves at times. But, he is not the worst actor in the prequel trilogy(that dubious award goes to Natalie Portman, who imo actually had better chemistry with Llyod then with Hayden Christiansen.) My major complaints however are Yoda's looks(looks way better as CGI then a puppet.), and Darth Maul's limited character. Darth Maul could have been an extremely cool and effective bad guy given a bit more screen time. The battles are exciting and the dialog is way better then that of episode 2. Although not as good as the original trilogy, the Phantom Menace is worth a watch. 7/10",0

Another thing to mention is the movie is a little bit long for this story i was forcing myself to keep watching after maybe 1 hour into it, they should have ended it early and not drag it for 2 hours!",1

Notorious for Jar-Jar Binks and others, there was a lot of hype over this long-awaited prequel to the ultra-popular ""Star Wars"" trilogy. This is one of the most backlashed films of all time, and even today it's considered a great disappointment.",0
1884,6.0,"Last night I revisited this film for the first time in years with a slightly fresh take on it. I have to admit, I felt very let down when I first saw the film (as like so many others, I think it's almost universally acknowledged that this was some way off any of the originals). The truth is - this is a very mixed bag of a film. It's full of goofy and ironically, animated Disney-like moments (strangely now feels like an omen) but there are some great sequences amongst the awkwardness of it all. The Neeson/ Qui Gon scenes seem to stand out as the best - I liked how he connected with Shmi, his interesting relationship with the Jedi Council,. his closeness to Obi Wan/Qui etc etc. This was all characterised extremely well. The lightsaber duels at the end were also excellent, with some great Darth Maul moments, and a cleverly concocted suspense with those red forcefield doors creating delays before each part of the fight. And on the bad CGI imagined characters, Watto the Toydarian was the better of the animated characters for me.",1
1885,10.0,A special beginning for a story that shows how it all started by simple events to major and epic events from the start to the finish it was a rush for survival and victory with great cgi and characters with different jobs and duties as important as it is for each character to act perfectly in thier field showing the enemy as a threat to each part of the mission and an inevitable duel to progress further in without any plot armor or unexplainable event throughout the film and having even characters that can not fight with important duties to perform in order for the mission to successfully be accomplished.,1

I thought it was good enough and worthy of SW franchise. Move forward 20 years later, however, when I tried (albeit cautiously) to re-watch this movie, I found this movie was really UNBEARABLE and UNWATCHABLE at the same time. Watching this had been my cross to bear. I was never the one who walked out of movie no matter how bad it was but thank goodness this time I could just pause the streaming and come back the following days.

1888,6.0,"I started marathoning the famous 'Star Wars' and I'm fascinated by the richness of the details but not so much that the story got overstuffed and messy. In this first half, it's admittedly a little difficult to understand what the film is going to be about, only when it comes to the part where they meet Luke Skywalker's mother does things become more clear. The production goes without saying that it is well crafted, the good thing about Star Wars is that we are always transported to different universes and places, which for the eyes is showy and attractive. During the film, there is Senator Padmé who seems very static and still in the scenes, which makes even her movements almost null in this film. As this was the first episode, I believe they did not know how to 'start' with several elements played and without connection between them, I only understood the ending, which is the battle of Jedi x Sith, it is visible that many parts are less serious for the saga, an example is the use of the silliest and silliest language that in the end was something to please the children's audience, which is very far from Star Wars language, but the technology is incredible.",1

I would go see a sequal to Anaconda before I saw the next Star Wars.",0

Next, okay, I know, it is all computer made, who cares, we don't need an endless pod racing scene or useless computer animated characters to prove it and Jar Jar, shut the fudge up. Finally, I think it was a little too made-for-kids.",0
1893,10.0,"I make no excuses for Jar-Jar; he is an obnoxious, incomprehensible character. Otherwise, the movie features a brilliant plot satirizing the politics around imperialism and trade. It features a (mostly) wonderful cast of characters and a very strong. The action scenes are creative and engaging, and the real sets are beautiful and varied. While the pacing of the movie is a bit off for the first twenty minutes, it manages to fall into a smooth range of slow, character-driven sequences and fast, action-driven sequences.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful, and while one of the CGI sets leaves something to be desired, the rest still hold up today. Considering how dark the prequel trilogy would become, this first movie did a good job of offsetting this with a generally light atmosphere. By not using cliched heroes typical to contemporary action movies, Phantom Menace created a unique set up of characters that provided depth and unique viewpoints. The acting as a whole is outstanding, with Liam Neeson, Ewan mcGregor, Natalie Portman, and Ian McDiarmid in particular providing exceptional performances.<br /><br />What really makes this movie stand out is its intense creativity and uniqueness despite purposely paralleling A New Hope (The original star wars movie). Each scene is intended to provide a contrast to a scene from A New Hope: while NH opened with a small spaceship fleeing a large spaceship, Phantom Menace opens with a small spaceship approaching a large spaceship. While the death of a beloved mentor leads a hero to flee in NH, the same event leads a hero to fight and defeat an enemy in PM. This continual juxtaposition of events creates an excellent setup for the differences between Anakin's and Luke's respective journeys, while still paying homage to the original.<br /><br />Overall, Phantom Menace is a quality movie with great visuals, acting, and depth.",1
1894,7.0,"I know that no science fiction can top any of the three original STAR WARS films. The first one was groundbreaking and much like THE GODFATHER PART 2, EMPIRE was better than the original. And JEDI was a little underrated. Trust me, watch the last 30 minutes or so. The last 30 minutes are the ending to a legend. But, TPM wasn't that freaking bad. Really. It's watchable. But, the characters are a little chopped up. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker makes me vomited. Not really vomited, but there could have been someone better than him. He does add a childlike figure to Darth. You have to remember, this kid is the darkest human being on any film screen. So give it time, let it sink in. It's not that bad.",0

1896,1.0,"in my youth, i had been a huge star wars fan - i collected the action figures, and all the other paraphernalia. thus, when the prequel was announced, i figured it'd be something interesting to check out. unfortunately, this was not the case, as the movie has barely a synopsis, and the acting is appalling. i've seen many a bad movie but this one rules the bottom ten big time. what's even worse, this movie contains racist stereotypes: jar jar binks is the classical `yessuh, massa' no-brains-negro-character (he even was synchronized by an african-american), while matto (matto? see, i even forgot the name) alludes to the alleged jewish mentality to exploit others in order to earn money - by any means necessary. if you're an ordinary spectator, and not a fan of the series, you won't even understand what's so special about the character anakin skywalker. lucas treats the people who go watch the flick `as fans, not as an audience' (quote: the guardian, fri jul 16), and that marks him as a perfect a**hole. not to mention the blasphemic jesus-bull***t that anakin skywalker doesn't have a father but has been given birth by his mother due to divine causes - give me a break. however, i'm realistic enough to foresee that the economical success of this movie is out of question. may the pestilence be with you.",0
1897,6.0,"I know that cinema is no longer to be considered Art, but just Entertainment... Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie. The plot was weak and predictable, with so many holes you could spend hours enumerating them (I'll just point one: why the hell the wise Jedi knight takes a kid with him while assaulting the castle????). The characters, even if well acted, were flat. Think about the dark charm of Darth Vader, and compare with this meaningless Darth Maul... he doesn't even speak. Is he kind of an idiot??",0

So I implore you please look at the movie and do not have your vision clouded by the people so close minded that they don't see the sure intelligence of the film.  And so to end I will say the Pod Race was pretty bad.",0
1899,9.0,"Ok, so there were flaws, but wait for the next two movies and then we'll see how just how cool this one really is. It's a shame it got the criticism it did, especially the outrageous comments like ""Jar Jar is a racist stereotype"" and the like. Get a life people! This is just a silly fantasy movie. Star Wars always has been. It was always meant for a young audience, but managed to capture the heart and minds of kids and adults alike. You cannot take this movie too seriously, that is not the point. It's just a movie! And as far as being somewhat vague as far as story is concerned, this movie is only an ""establishing movie"" because it sets up a lot of characters for the next two movies. And of course, the effects are outstanding. Hands down the most beautiful piece of film making I have ever seen. Looking forward to the next two.",1

The characters are just bland as hell, that's all. Liam Neeson picked up a big paycheck for this one, that's all.",0
1902,9.0,"This is a solid new addition to the Star Wars Saga and will create even more new fans (especially young recruits) of the Star Wars Universe. The Special effects are truly a sight to behold more than once as there are many hidden sights to view. Watch closely during the Scene in the Senate chamber and you'll finally know where E.T. was phoning home to or was he calling a Wookie. The special effects and hidden sights are worth the price of admission alone. The story is familiar and yet new. It also has some political intrigue to it. Indeed this story is more about setting up the events of the next two movies than it is about telling a story for the moment. There is a level of political intrigue as Senator Palpatine begins his path to becoming Emporer, and we are introduced to Darth Sidious, who has suspicious similarities to the senator. We are introduced to the characters of Amidala, Obi Wan, Anakin, Yoda and legions of others who will likely play a role in unfolding of the saga that will lead us back to A New Hope where it all began. I was quite pleased to be able to see R2, C3PO, Jabba, and others from the orginal trilogy on the big screen again and I must say that I found the new aliens to be less distracting than some of the early reviews would have led one to believe. However, There are a few disturbing elements of the dark side in this 1st installment of the Star Wars Saga that I hope George Lucas will allow the force to correct in Episode II. Many of the key aliens have voices that are inaudible or just simply distracting from the action that was occurring on screen. I wish there had been less of dialogue like ""Mesa Hata Thisa Waya yousa Talkin."" There were times when I was begging for captioning so I could understand what they were saying. Speaking of Dialogue, if only Darth Maul had been given some. Instead he gets the Boba Fett Treatmen. The human actors were slightly cardboard at times but acceptable and I love the hints of Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan in the Obi Wan of Ewan McGregor. The movie is more like Jedi in its pace as opposed to ANH or ESB. At times it could have used a Han Solo adrenalin rush. Still it is star wars at its heart and if you are patient and do not fear change the dark side will lose out and you'll find yourself loving this movie as I do. Of the four movies so far I rate them out of five stars: Star Wars: ANH ****1/2 Empire Strikes Back ***** Phantom Menace ***1/2 (slightly beats Jedi- Yoda's alive and there are no Ewoks) Return of the Jedi ***1/2",1

But when I saw this movie, I was amazed!  I saw this twice in the theatres and I'm not sick of it.  The special effects were wonderful, and the casts were great, (especially Ray Park as Darth Maul). The storyline was fairly good.  I have to say that it wasn't superb, it was average.  The other episodes of Star Wars were much better, its just that The Phantom Menace tells you more about the force, the jedi, the dark side, etc.  It also tells you more about Anakin and Queen Amidala's relationship between each other.  It tells you how they meet and how they get along. This will be good for the other prequels, episode II and III.  So overall, I rate this movie 8/10.

It's musical score is absolutely stunning, and the characters, save for Jar Jar, are all enjoyable and heartfelt. A common complaint about this film is the lengthy politics, however I for one was entertained by them. It does very much feel like a solo entry in a franchise, rather then a starting point. The CGI is very, very wonky and in many scenes does not work. Many backgrounds look like a cheap green screen, and CGI characters such as the droids or Jar Jar don't feel like real, living people. The films pacing and dialogue can also be very poor, with many characters not talking like real people. It's still an enjoyable film with immense world building however.",0

Jackson, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman. ",0
1913,5.0,"The Phantom Menace is a movie with problems, most of them are character based. From a film making point of view it is okay, the directing has a tendency to be lazy and the movie seems to neglect to provide all the information the audience needs to make sense of the story. But it does have moments when it shines... it contains some very striking ideas and scenes. Unfortunately the main characters are not developed enough to make the audience feel like they are being taken on a journey with them and are apart of this galaxy. Overall, for the majority of people, it is not a highly re-watchable movie. I am sure kids 6 - 10 will enjoy it many times. But to me 1977 Star Wars was a family movie and I think TPM is too one dimensional and at times aggravating to be labelled as that. Having said that I think people would be more forgiving of this movie if the following two episodes were really good. Also the hype and expectation for this film in 1999 did make it an impossible task to please everyone - the criticism was enormous (especially for Jar Jar Binks). Since 1999 the movie, like any movie, has its fans, but will never be embraced with a huge amount of popularity - I can't see a limited edition Jar Jar Binks figure in commander gear coming to a store near you any time soon.",1

Yes, it does have some awkward dialogue and acting, but I don't think even the old trilogy's dialogue and acting were the greatest strength of the movies (do normal people suddenly stand up and go into some sentimental soliloquy like most critically successful movies?). The best thing about the old trilogy and The Phantom Menace are imagination, setting, mysterious mythical history, good vs. evil (good triumphing over evil), cool machines, and masterful action.  Another thing was that I think people were expecting the old trilogy.  Well, get your heads out the clouds, its not the old trilogy.",1

The Phantom Menace is the introduction to an introductory trilogy, and I'm glad to have set my expectations to just that level.

1916,6.0,"Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching The Phantom Menace and thought it well worth going to see, but it was clear to me that George Lucas' focus was in the wrong direction. Was it necessary for every single scene to have some kind of CGI enhancement no matter how small? That isn't what made the first ones so good. He was too eager to be visually spectacular (the big fish, even bigger fish bit was decidedly ill-advised). Though the locations were spectacular and fantastic, they were too abundant, detracting from the characters and the story which should have been the focus of the film. Another problem was the apparent determination to fit everyone and everything else in there, the sandpeople didn't need to be there, but they were, pointlessly, just to satisfy the 'trainspotters', the Jedi Mind Trick was slightly overused (although at one point to good comic effect) and in the apparent desire to satisfy the nerdiest of all Star Wars fans, a scientific explanation for the force was given! Surely the whole point of it, why we were so taken with it, was the pure clean mystery about it.",1

1920,,"My buddy Dave and I were two of several hundred people waiting in line at Phipps Plaza last night around midnight, and among several thousand nuts, night-owls, and geeks around the nation hanging out in local movie theatres in anticipation of ""The Phantom Menace"".  We became the first few of what will likely be millions of people to see ""Episode I"", the latest George Lucas (who shares the same birthday as I do) ""Star Wars"" film.  I could not help but remember that summer when I was 7, also waiting in these same lines (though in Knoxville, Tennessee) to see ""Star Wars"" for the up-teenth time, just so I could go home and brag that I was one-up on my good buddy Chris Leonard on how many times we had seen the movie (bet I am one-up on him again).  Anyway, they let us in last night 45 minutes early and the crowd did not stop buzzing until a roar went up when we all saw the words ""Star Wars"" flash on the screen, and then start it's slow descent off in space, followed by ""Episode I"" and then a short description of where we were and what was going on in the 'present time' of the movie (known for that trapezoidal text-crawl).  I must say that the first half was somewhat slow and often flat, but the film really picked up speed (in many ways) in the second half.  There were many shouts from the audience when we first saw a young Obi-Wan, or when R2-D2 meets C-3PO, or when we first heard the name ""Skywalker"".  Like it or not, this is probably the most anticipated film in history and will eventually become part of our culture just as the 3 earlier movies did and just as the next 2 will.  ""The Phantom Menace"" was certainly not the best film I had ever seen, but I did not go into it thinking it would be.  The effects were what you would expect and though the acting was sometimes dull, ""Menace"" does not disappoint.  Like me, you will most certainly leave the theatre pleased, waiting for ""Episode II""...",1
1921,,"In this 'smash hit' which is low on everything including genuinely exciting action we are given cardboard, one dimensional characters, awful direction, awful camera work, and quite frankly, shocking casting, we see a plot which could put anyone to sleep and little to no expansion on the original trilogy.                                                         I am sick of modern directors who use effects to win the audience over. This film does not make us want the Jedi to win. Darth Maul is a complete stranger who does nothing to make us hate him. It would have been much better if we had started off with three Jedi Knights and we had got to know the third one until the evil Darth Maul comes along and mercilessly kills him. Instead you can't help rooting for him in the end. As well as an awful script the acting from Natalie Portman and Ewan Mcgregor. They seemed embarrassed to say their lines, who can blame them. Onto Anakin Skywalker. An awful character and damnably annoying. I was reminded of Wacky Races more than Ben Hur. Yet because of Liam Neeson's performance and Jar Jar Binks. I will give this a six out of ten. Maybe it is just because I am not into Sci Fi in the slightest but it can be entertaining probably for kids. I see this as one to miss.",0
1922,,"The Phantom Menace, Episode 1 in the Star Wars series.  Not the best movie, but not a bad one.  And regardless, this movie is just another indication of the amazing brilliance of writer/director George Lucas.",1
1923,1.0,"Having seen the TPM three times now my opinion is that it was a disaster of a Star Wars film. Shockingly bad in parts, I believe the TPM has now seriously damaged the story of the prequels and infuriated many of the fans of the original films who expected to see a far superior film.",0
1924,,"I know it must have been hard to cope with the pressure of following the legendary previous Star Wars films, but I think Georgie could have at least have attempted to make the film indurable to an adult audience. The first three films were all classified as Universal for family viewing, yet it neatly avoided talking down to its audience. The Phantom Menace is like a Diseney version of Star Wars with so much animation on screen as to make it impossible to allow it to be escapism for anyone over the age of six. Cartoon effects are not impressive compared to the model work of the first three. However, I hasten to add, there is still a lot in the film worth watching. The light-saber battles are outstanding.",1
1925,10.0,"First let me start off by saying Phantom Menace is not a patch on the original trilogy. (However those films were not only ground breaking, but also pasted into the social conscience). So perhaps it was unreasonable to expect such a feat by George Lucas. But is it so painful to get through. Nah I don't think so.If u forget that gungan who should suffer pure pain, and the fact that Lucas for some god known reason decided to turn Anakin into the next Home Alone kid. But the good points: yes Darth Maul was cool, Natalie Portman, John Williams again delivered, and ofcourse the best fight scene I have ever seen. As far as Episode 2 goes, it is a good thing people are bagging it already. It means expectations will be less. People will be pleasantly surprised by the next one which Ewan Mcgregor calls f**king brilliant. This coming from a man who bagged Menace months before it came out. To the optimists I say the next one will be a true return to form . To the pessimists, we will see in May .",1
1926,,"First off, I should say, I had never seen anything of Star Wars before watching Episode 1. I had seen a bit of Ep. 1 before in Target, and I had seen a little of A New Hope, but I had no idea of plot. I knew who the Jedi Knights were, and who Jar Jar is, just like everybody else who hasn't been living under a rock for the past thirty years, but I did not know anything about what the Star Wars universe is all about. I had a completely objective view--I had no idea if I would love it or hate it. Also, this is another movie I watched just because Ewan McGregor, as Obi-Wan, is in it.",1
1927,2.0,"Hands up anyone who thinks that George Lucas should be shot for ruining a great series of films. Okay, so he did direct Episode IV which is in many peoples views one of the greatest films ever, fair enough, but that doesn't excuse him from the travesty he has now created. ",1
1928,6.0,"Prequels are always dangerous. One has to tell a story where anyone familiar with the franchise knows where all the main pieces end up. Even The Hobbit, which had a relatively easy time with it, bloated the film(s) unnecessarily. Star Wars though had a very clear start point in Episode IV; there's little that one can be surprised with by the end of the prequel. In the case of Phantom Menace this is even more difficult, as it is more 2-hour prologue than prequel.",1
1929,3.0,"Boring characters without characterization, boring story that ruins the mystery around Darth Vader on the original trilogy, bad CGI that make my eyes bleed and a horrible, nasty Jar Jar Binks that is annoying and unfunny. It also has the stupid fact that Anakin ""accidentally"" destroys a freaking basement. Trash, trash, trash. The only good thing about this cash grab is the final battle against Darth Maul. Great direction on that fight scene, but i don't care about any character so... yes, still not a good fight scene.",0
1930,7.0,"The Phantom Menace has gotten a lot of hate over the years, some of it deserved, a majority of it undeserved. I still say the prequels introduce an absolutely enthrawling time period, a complex narrative and interesting characters. This movie does all of that, even being the worst of the Lucas era.",0
1931,7.0,"Well, not that anyone would care for my opinion - I just have to write it anyway. There is one and only one reason to see this movie and (correct) it's the special effects. They are amazing. They are beyond anything ever seen before. They are nearly flawless (from a technical point of view) and perfectly integrated. Everything else in this movie was pretty much forgettable and some things really hurt (me at least). Among all things, this movie starts with a taxation dispute. Gone are the days of swashbuckling heroes with a loose tongue and a good sense of humor. Everything is business now, even the storyline. For the loose tongue we get wooden dialoge (which at certain points is just really, really bad and completely unbelievable) and the humor is now provided by fully animated fart jokes and one of the most annoying sidekicks I have ever seen. The force is now the effect of some microbes and can be measured by means of a blood sample and Darth Vader is virgin-born messiah who speaks to his mom as if reciting from ancient scriptures (altough I believe this point may be altered in the coming episodes). In this galaxy, I would not be too surprised to find the planet Zeist somewhere. But all of this would be unimportant if the story would run smoothly. Unfortunately it does not. The movie takes no time to introduce us into its universe, we get thrown right into it. The plot is contrived and most scenes feel packed with necessary references for the sequels and expository dialoge. Those which are not are technically excellent, but really superfluous from a story point of view. The light saber 'duels' for example are top notch action and far better than anything seen in the original trilogy, but Darth Maul is just your typical pop-up-enemy with no background and totally lacks the evil aura of the original Darth Vader. Even worse is senator Palpatine, who we know will become the evil emperor finally. There is nothing scary or sinister about him and none of his manipulative tricks is ever shown. The only scary thing is our knowledge of his eventual fate. There is a lot that I would still like to comment, but let me just mention the scene cuts. The editing left me extremely unsatisfied as I felt some scenes were cut right in the middle. This very much added to my impression, that this film is overcrowded and tries to accomplish too much in too little time.",0
1932,10.0,"What can I say? I LOVED IT! Even though I hated all the use of CGI (Computer Graphic Imaging) and I equally hated that duck-billed-rabbit-eared-annoyance JAR JAR BINKS, It was still an excellent film. It was the best STAR WARS movie since ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK""! All the characters were great (except the horribly mis-cast Samuel L. Jackson)! The Pod race and the Jedi showdown with DARTH MAUL alone was worth the price of admission (and the hours waiting in line). It was a very fun film! If you wanna see some ""deep plot & serious acting"" then go see a SHAKESPEARE play, but if you want to have a damn fun time at the movies then go see STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE.",1
1933,,"Used to like the STar Wars films, back when I was 15 or so. Remained largely faithful to them, or at least liked them a fair bit. Then Phantom Menace came out.",1
1934,10.0,"yes, it's true, this movie is awesome!",1
1935,10.0,"I have to admit, I was skeptical about how this movie was going to turn out. I was blown away, I loved every moment of this movie. It is almost like the original Star Wars over again, Anakin is taken under the wing of Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and he learns about the Jedi. It was exciting to say the least. Darth Maul is a villain you love to hate. You also cannot help but feel like you know a lot of these characters from before somewhere. It was great to see some of our old favorites in action for the very first time! The movie was great that it also left a lot of important questions unanswered, it grips you and you can't wait for episodes II and III. We'll be waiting Lucas! 10 out of 10!!!!!",1
1936,8.0,"I have like millions of other waited a very long time for this masterpiece and when it´s finally came, I got a little disappointed. Though it´s great it could have been even better. Can´t say what´s missing, but something it is. Great sound and when you are in a theater you can almost feel that you are a part of the story. Can´t say that I know Ewan, but he was very good in his role as Obi-One. I hope that all of you who read this will go and see it. Though it is not a ten, it´s surely worth seeing.",1
1937,8.0,"Well, I'm sitting here watching the original movie in it's original state and I must say, 22 years of technology makes a big difference.  The movie story line was okay, but the special effects were so good, I had to give the movie a 10.  The sound effects were amazing, but a little loud.  Natalie Portman, as fine as she is, needs some acting lessons.  The monotone portrayal of the queen and her hand maiden reminds me of Carrie Fishers cheesey portrayal of Leah in the original.  Carrie, like Natalie, couldn't decide whether to use an english accent or an American accent.  So, she used both.  Also, the beginning of the movie with Liam and Co. slashing droids with their light sabres wore thin quickly.  Other than that, the movie was very entertaining.  This movie makes the 1977 original look very cheesey. Almost ""B"" movie quality in terms of effects.  What will they come up with next?  WOW!",0
1938,6.0,"I expected a LOT more out of this movie, and I think that Lucas had better get something going with this, or the next one might not be as profitable. It was more of a kid's movie, and the creature with the floppy ears that stayed with the Jedi throughout the movie was annoying more than anything. The plot tying in the trilogy lasted about 5 minutes in all, and I expected more of this. If you haven't seen this movie, and expect it to be like Star Wars, then you will be disappointed.  The drama just isn't there.  Too much uncalled-for humor that wasn't in the first film is in Phantom Menace.",0

1940,7.0,"The Star Wars legend has entered mythology, for our generation. It's almost as if ""The Phantom Menace"" is ""based on a true story"", a theoretical recreation of the events that led to the story which we know and love. That said, it isn't bad. The knowing smile that crosses one's lips when Anakin meets Obi-Wan is affectionate, the nostalgic reaction to a light-sabre battle worth the price of entrance alone. The only gripe is the ""Wicket Factor"". If you remember the cute Ewok who first meets Leia and your reaction to him, then you'll appreciate my reaction to Jar Jar Binks and the other child-pleasing elements of the movie (pod racing commentator with two heads, Anakin's little buddies). I found them slightly out of touch with the true essence of Star Wars, as the Ewoks were. Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson do fantastic jobs in tough roles, though one suspects that his Jedi nonchalance was in part caused by the blue screen that he must have been acting with. Hey, we didn't expect another Empire Strikes Back.",1

This was better then the first 3 movies because the effects were way better thanks to the HI-TEC of today, I also liked the characters more. Who could believe little Anakin would be Darth-Vader?",1
1943,2.0,"HUGE SW fan here. But a fan not a fanboi. The difference? A fanboi can't acknowledge that sometimes the franchise is utter garbage, every installment is glorious. A fan, on the other hand, acknowledges the successes and calls out the failures.And Ep 1 TPM is a colossal failure. Awful on every level. Cringe-worthy and painfully bad.",0
1944,10.0,"the plot is rather good and so is the direction some scenes feeling very epic but i think its the lame characters and acting that let this film down, none of the characters have the charisma of Han solo or Darth Vader, but that was not the main problem it was jar-jar he is the most annoying creation ever and should burn in the fiery pits of hell for all eternity . another thing is that i didn't feel exited like i did with the old movies it wasn't the plot that was pretty good but it was the actors all but Liam neeson (qui-gon)seemed out of place and to uncomfortable in there roles which is a big let down because all the actors from the old films seemed so alive and involved (it probably is because its mostly done on blue screen).

1949,7.0,"Something was missing from the premier chapter of the Star Wars saga.  So many extra's have been put into George Lucas' 1999 installment but he ultimately sabotogued his pure, spiritual vision from the original trilogy. The visuals are very stimulating and the action scenes in THE PHANTOM MENACE leave you wanting more.  This time around, the action starts a generation before Luke Skywalker's birth, as brave jedi knights struggle to bring justice to an oppressed planet at the hands of the evil sith.  The power of the force suffers from scientific overload and the plot stutters repeatedly in scenes filled by ridiculous, useless and pointless CGI alien characters (no names need be mentioned).  The Star Wars saga is setup well, with major characters being introduced and the archetypal good vs. evil conflict begins.  Some of the magic is gone, but the promise of a deeper, darker character driven sequel is eminent in the film's cliffhanger ending.",0
1950,,The cartoons were very realistic. I was waiting for Pokemon to come out and fly little Anakin away. But he didn't.,1
1951,7.0,"Solid Star Wars movie, Qui Gon Jinn is an amazing character and the foreshadowing is perfect, Anakins acting and Jar Jar drag this movie down. Fighting is also really good but Darth Maul didn't have enough time and he relied on clone wars but other than that the movies pretty good.",1
1952,6.0,"The movie was okay although the whole fight scene with Darth Maul made the movie.  I was one of the people who saw the movie on the first day, 12:01AM showing.  Although I will say this much, unlike some people who stayed in line all day, I stood in line for about fifteen minutes, was told that the movie sold out, then told that there was a drawing being held, lost the drawing, then had my Mother go up to the lady passing out winning tickets and had her ask for two tickets in which the lady said okay.  And I am happy this I got in that way because I would have been upset having waited for so long and paid money for that.",0
1953,,"First of all, let me qualify my review of PHANTOM MENACE with my position on the STAR WARS saga overall.  The first film (episode IV, NEW BEGINNING, or whatever) was undoubtedly the best, with a great story and simple, uncomplicated (but still very interesting) characters.  The original stands on its own, complete in and of itself.",1
1954,7.0,"This movie really is flawed because the way the jokes land sometimes in this film not great, Jar jar is that example. Yes jar jar is an cool character and ahmed best did great, just in here he can be kinda of is to kiddish (I think that's the word for it) but movie is still a great Star Wars movie because the movie feels like an true start to the skywalker saga and how it builds the message of family. The end of the movie is so good.",1
1955,,"I simply couldn't believe when I saw this film... I couldn't belive how big, quality trilogy has been destroyed...This ""prequel"" no matter cause It has been done 20 years for prequeling is nothing but obsessive special effects movie. It seems that all the technology and equipment they didn't have 20 years ago they decided to improve now when they have it by putting more and more and more. The whole film is practically special effect without strong plot,with bad acting and no courage. First 2 films for me had courage, relaxed and happy feeling. This "" blockbuster"" has nothing but ""tremendous"" effects people haven't seen... blah blah blah, I even feel stupid on commenting more than one word : BAD. 2/10",0
1956,6.0,"Let me start this review by saying that this is not a quintessential Star Wars film, for me anyway. It is much slower-paced than any of the other eight films in the Skywalker Saga. But it does make up for that by having a good story with two likable leads and a badass main villain. But the biggest problems I have with this film personally more have to do with it's dialogue and acting. The two best actors in The Phantom Menace are Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson. They are possibly the only good actors in this film, in my opinion. It's not that actors and actresses like Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman are bad per se, they just don't have as much experience. And the dialogue, particularly that of kid Anakin, can be pretty cheesy.",0
1957,5.0,"Interesting story, but a slow one for sure. The fight with Darth Maul made the movie however. That was very very cool. This was my first taste of Star Wars and I will certainly be watching the rest after this. As I say. Not great by any means but enjoyable.",1
1958,,"Hey, man, I enjoyed this movie.  I seem to be in the minority here, but I have really no beefs with it.  After all, it IS George Lucas' story, not everyone else's.  The story is what it is.  I even found myself chuckling at Jar Jar at times.  Good special effects, established a storyline, good drama with the duel with darth maul, loved the pod races, and comic relief. Anyways, I don't have time to write a novel, so there's my 2 cents.",1
1959,5.0,"Let's be real if that endgame fight wasn't there this film would be draining to watch, from the poor acting from young Anakin to the pointless plan Palpatine had in mind, at least it had a pretty setting and introduced us to some fan favourite characters.",0

Once you see it, even if you have never seen any other Star Wars movie, you see what true film making really is. It was really very good, fantastic I would say.

If you can do this and still state that this movie lacks the soul of the original trilogy, well, phooey.  You're wrong.",0
1967,8.0,i think this is a very good film that deserves a better reputation than it has OK so its not as good as the original trilogy or even the rest of the prequels it is still much better than nine out of ten family blockbusters ever made what bugs me is people complaining about the overly happy ending yes it has a happy ending but everything that happens is the worst thing for the galaxy as a hole 1: darth maul dying sidious needs new apprentice 2: jedis agree to train anakin 3: palpatine elected leader of the senate all that happens in subsequent stories stems from the ending of this story i think the test of time will prove that this will go down as a classic along with the originals i enjoyed this the first time i saw it in 1999 and have found that i like it even more through further viewing 8.5/10,1

It is so awesome that Lucas did the last story first, and the first story last!  Liam Neeson was great in this movie.  It's one of the best performances he's ever given!  Jake Lloyd did a great job portraying young Anakin Skywalker.  I thought the special effects were the best ever used in a motion picture.  The pod race was amazingly subperb!  The pod racers themselves were so amazing.The lightsaber fights were much more better than the ones used in the original film.  The costumes were so awesome.

Once it really got into it, though, after they met young Skywalker, the film really started to feel like the others.  I was extremely pleased.  I think that Lucas may have got carried away with the special effects, but I was pleased to see that Yoda was still a puppet.  I left the movie theatre with an extreme feeling of joy and I felt like I was let in on some big secret.  It was a great feeling!

1974,,"sorry to say, but you are merely a critic and not a film maker. Do you realiZe how DIFFICULT and long it takes to make a film? Every key aspect must be taken into consideration, problems solved, and with a bit of improv it comes out great. I love the movie base it was non-stop action, special effects were amazing, and the music was fantastic. EX: duel of fates. You are just a critic and not a famous filmmaker. Instead of criticizing a film, maybe you should actually watch it and be entertained for just a little second. The problem with you critics is that your never in the spot light and judge films based on the amount of money coming your way. For example, critics said BIG FAT LIAR was the best comedy of the year, funnier than RAT RACE, and absolutely amazing.....it was terrible.Sorry i forgot, what is your name? Oh never mind no body cares.",0
1975,,"Ok, I have inadvertently seen this movie twice, and while it's definitely not a great film, it is thoroughly entertaining.  More so the first time, though.  The second time through I was just waiting for Darth Maul to show up.  Ok, the disappointing stuff first: the script was simplistic, and therefore the acting was moderate.  There were some great or at least very good actors in this movie (Liam Neeson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan MacGregor, etc.) but here they just weren't given much to do.  I understand the argument that these are meant to be archetypal characters and all, but it nevertheless got on my nerves.  And Jake Lloyd has got to go.  He got very annoying over time.  Did we really need all those ""Yippee!!""s?  Also, I predictably hated Jar Jar and, for that matter, did not like the Gunguns much at all.  Also, George Lucas' direction style seems to be gradually moving toward a very young audience with very short attention spans.  That said, here's what I did like: Darth Maul (hey, I have a thing for villains, what can I say?)--the dueling scene was in my opinion the best scene in the entire movie, and to quote EW magazine, DM made Vader look like Mary Poppins.  Also the computer graphics were obviously amazing--Naboo is absolutely beautiful.  I liked the battle droids and the ""futuristic hedgehog"" rolling droids (Forgive me, I don't know the proper names)  All in all, I am not a Star Wars junkie as some of my friends are, and I am therefore not a purist as far as these movies go.  I enjoy the first trilogy, but I don't find those movies to be terribly good either. Therefore, I went into Phantom Menace expecting not a great film, but pure, sometimes mindless entertainment as has been the tradition in Star Wars. If you go in with this expectation you won't be disappointed.  Two final thoughts:  Phantom Menace was sorely lacking the charismatic character Harrison Ford previously provided, and I would've liked it a whole lot more if they hadn't killed off the two best characters.",1
1976,7.0,"A lot of people have complained about this movie being the worst movie. I can tell you hear that the worst movie I have seen is Son of the Mask. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, I believe, is a good re-entry of the well known franchise we come to know and love. Now, I said good, not the best, and I'm a Star Wars fan. I tell you it is good because of a few things. One, the script did not exactly hit the mark like it did with the original trilogy. Two, the movie introduced a character that was a bit too childish and annoying to be a comic relief. And finally, the actor who played young Anakin was not the best choice. I hear that the script was terrible, it was too childish, the acting was wooden, it had too many special effects, and it was overall, a bad movie. But there are a few points I would like to make: 1. It is difficult for George Lucas to come up with good quality prequels that has been shelved for 22 years. 2. Lucas has made special effects more realistic since the first movie. He is trying to push the boundaries with that technology. Besides, the reason he didn't have the prequels is because he didn't have the special effects he needed to make them. 3. It's a kid's movie. Don't be too rash on the film, calling it too childish. You were kids when you saw the first movie and you liked it. Now let your kids enjoy this movie. Just because you got older and more mature doesn't mean Star Wars won't grow older and more mature. 4. The reason for the movie to be very political is because it reflects on ourand the world's government. It shows us of how a government could fall over greed and power. 5. Jar Jar Binks is there because C-3PO and R2-D2 didn't exist as comic reliefs. Jar Jar maybe annoying and a little childish, but it shows us of the childish nature within ourselves.",0

But I went to my grandma's house for about a week on vacation and my mum and I HAD to get away from her, so we went and saw this movie. I must say, I really liked it. It has some major flaws, but I believe the effects make up for it. I really didnt much like Jar-Jar..he's cute and all, but I really wish I knew what he was saying. He shouldnt have had such a dumb accent. The aliens that spoke english gave me a headache. Their lips werent moving in anyway what-so-ever to what I ours might. I had to look away when they talked to understand. I think Mr. Neeson is a MAJOR BABE...who cares if he's 47? He's definetly hot! ANd Mr McGregor...well what can I say, he's a major hottie, too. Maybe they didnt have the perfect roles, but I think the movie is so awesome. I would recommend all SW fans to see it, and even those who arent. It has the best effects I have ever seen.

It is also about the trickary of Palpetine(The Phantom Menance) and how know one forsees the grave danger about to turn the world around.  Anyways, I come to this section and alles I read is forty years complaining about how this isn't as magically as it was twenty years ago. What they fail to realize is that it isn't the movie fault it is the fact that they have grown up a can no long feel the fantasitic adventures. Don't get me wrong it is more suited for kids than the origonals.  Next time you see the movie go back to when you first seen the origonals and than watch it.  You will be amazed.  The Force is strong.  ROTJ and TPM are not marketing movies it's a bunch of Trekkies telling lies. DAVE",0
1980,10.0,"If Shakespeare was alive today his idea's and playwriting skills would be no match for George Lucas.  The Phantom Menance puzzles all of us who have seen the origonal trilogy but I suspect that after Episode Two and Three everything will start making sense in The Phantom Menance is trimput of great strengh and a passionate quest for freedom.  The same qualities demonstrated in the first three.  The special effects can be overbarring at some points of the film but lets face it we are moving into a digital revolution.  This isn't your father's Star Wars though, it appeals to a young audiences and it excepts you to figure out the hidden plot that some people ethier have not figured out or choose to ignore because Han Solo and Chewbacca are not characters in these movies.  All you people can't stand to watch this movie need to develop a little imagination(I'm not talking about the ways to kill off Jar-Jar Binks here ethier) we you people learn to calm your mind you will see a great movie till than may the force be with you.",1
1981,10.0,"Why did the rebels use tom-tom's on hoth when we know they have the technology to build a snowmobile that could withstand the extreme temperatures. Answer that one for me dusty-7. Let me ask you this question. When was the last time you saw a movie with exquatic places, detailed costumtree, and about fifty different races. We won't even mention the podracing and Lightsaber battle scenes. Let me answer it for you, you haven't.  I understand why people think this movie is callow but all of us have a childish side we just aren't willing to allow that side of us to explore this movie. It's because we expect this movie to entrench the hot medium.  Star Wars is about imagination even though it contains universal issues.  Anyways, comparing Babylon 5 and a Star Wars movie is the like comparing a McDonald's hamburger to a dinner club's hamburger.  They're not in the same game or ballpark. And the money and fame issue. Star Wars is for the fans. Lucas made the movie for one reason and that is because he wanted to give his fans the prequels. If it was for the money he would have continued off of Return of the Jedi. I serious doubt that Ewan McGreagor did Obi-wan to be more famous. He already was a popular guy. The acting in this movie is not the actors best at no means but realize this the Star Wars movies are not movies were one actor must strut a masterpiece performance for it to achieve greatness like Citizen Kane.

But the brisk 40 degree weather cleared my mind as I made the mile walk back to my dorm at 2:30am.  The point of this comment is there is a lot of faults but the true greatness of this movie will not be discovered until all six movies are combined.

Every time I watch this movie I receive a great experience that most people can't obtain because they're unwilling to look past the hype.  I feel sorry for you.

1984,10.0,"Lucas is a genius.  Another quality episode created in the eyes of a true modern day Shakespeare. Despite it's greatness Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace has taken shots from almost everyone. According to the people who call themselves true Star Wars fans there is no reason Jar Jar Binks should have survived the opening scenes. What is wrong with you people? Jar Jar maybe annoyeng but so was Judas. And we all know that without Judas; Jesus's death would not have been as gratifing. The problem is too many people are seeing the movie not feeling the movie. This movie moves with great fore-shadowing that is as thick as a McDonald's milk shake. The movie ventures off of the origional three star wars but keeps the common focus on the common Star Wars standards. It entails a lot of Biblical references but drifts into comman universial issues with classic human nature characteristics.  The way I feel about the people critizing George Lucas for this movie reminds me to give them this quote, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing.""-Darth Sidous All in all this movie was the best movie of 1999 and maybe the decade. Go out and pick this movie up because you will regret it in seven years if you don't. And when it comes to the academy they are not Star Wars fans just ""posiers with Oscars"" and if anyone says that they're Star Wars fans and only talk about the things they hate about this movie are ""Posiers without Oscars"". I'm sorry if I have offend anyone I'd be happy to discuss this anytime just e-mail me. Try to look past the hype and enjoy a truely crafted masterpiece. Thank You GrungeMasterDeluxe @yahoo.com",1
1985,10.0,"All I hear about this movie is that Jar Jar Binks is annoying.  I found Judas annoying too but without him Jesus's Death would not have been as great.  I read one review where a person critized Lucas for using state of the art technology. He wanted him to use the same technology as he did in ep.4,5,6. Lucas is a person who likes to stay five years ahead of the Special Effects industry not fifteen years behind. The academy can take their oscars and shove them directly up there American Beauty a**es. Because the best movie of 1999 and probably the decade is The Phantom Menence. As I hear all the criticism it makes me relate to a line spoken by Darth Sidous, ""I find your lack of faith disturbing"". This movie has quality quotes, a great plot, thick fore-shadowing, many three-demensional charactors, human nature references, many biblical references, and oh yeah! the best special effects to date.  George Lucas is the modern day Shakespeare.  This is a well crafted masterpiece, and in seven years when you go to your collection of movies, your going to realize that Star Wars:Episode I The Phantom Menace is a superior movie and your going to wonder why you were disappointed in it in the first place(directed at Chris Connelly at MTV).

He'll annoy you to the point you want to switch to the dark side and finish him off. 2) way too much CGI and too little story. 3) little 7-8 yr old Anakin, future Darth Vader, is terrible. If a list of worst child actors was released this kid would be at the top of the list. Maybe it's not all his fault as Lucas puts these actors in impossible situations because of poor dialogue. Lucas has clearly lost touch with the ability to create seamless dialogue.<br /><br /> I could go on and on about this massive disappointment.

The close-up work, the computer-generated scenes of massing armies, the battle scenes, all stand up to pretty close scrutiny.

1992,1.0,"I just saw The Phantom Menace, and I'm gonna have to go with the flow: this movie wasn't so good..  It had potential, but blew it with lines such as ""Yahoo!"" and... ""Yahoo!""  When this movie comes out on tape I think I'll re-record it, but with all of Anakin and Jar-Jar's lines Muted out, that just might change my mind about the movie.  Now anyhow, coming to my point: This movie sucked, What's the big surprise??  Didn't you people see the other Star Wars??  I know, I had ""fond"" memories of them, too, but when I actually went back and WATCHED the old Star Wars movies, they weren't so great either.  The acting was just as bad in the old SW movies as in the new one.  The only thing I really liked about Episodes 4,5, & 6 was Harrison Ford.  Now, I would've said the same for Liam Neeson, but they already killed him off.  Who's left to support the next two Star Wars movies?? Now, I'll admit Empire Strikes Back was a good movie, but it was a ""mid-way"" movie, with no real beginning or end.  And the two supporting links (A New Hope and Return of the Jedi) were weak. And one additional question for you to ponder:  How did George Lucas manage to make Yoda look even faker than in the original movies and how did he manage to create a race (Jar-jar & co) MORE annoying than the Ewoks:?? Now in conclusion, I'm not in any way saying ""Don't see this movie"", but when you see it, let your opinions be heard, and maybe George Lucas will hire REAL writers for the next movies..",0
1993,7.0,"I think Cecil B. De Mille's ghost must have been whispering into George Lucas' ear during the production of this epic. It has a cast of millions (of species). Well, Cec certainly influenced the grandeur of the sets, special effects and production scale but, fortunately, Lucas chose Liam Neeson rather than Charlton Heston for the starring role. It was a good flick - given that it is the first of the series - by the time he gets to episode six he should (did) do better. It is worth seeing, though it drags in places. The menagerie was especially terrific. I freaked out in the part among the 'goldfish bowls'. Boy, am I gonna have some real interesting nightmares from now on !",1
1994,,"First, the awesome special effects and acting of Neeson, McGregor, and Portman saved the movie from being one of the greatest flops in history.",1
1995,6.0,"Since this is mostly a bad movie, I'll start with the negatives. The first are the performances. It was cool to see Liam Neeson play the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon, but his performance as the character was very stale and unemotional. I don't think that it was because of Neeson, but mostly because of the script. The other main actor is Ewan McGregor playing the amazing Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the original trilogy, Obi-Wan was one of my favourite characters and he was portrayed excellently by Alec Guiness. In this movie, he wasn't so great. Again, this was mostly down to the script for the character but Ewan could've done something to be more energetic or wise, especially considering he's playing a younger version of Obi-Wan. Natalie Portman is this movie is also very basic and doesn't show any real emotion. Finally, Jake Lloyd should not have been cast as the young Anakin Skywalker. ",0
1996,7.0,"The Phantom Menace is not a perfect film, in both a fan's perspective and a mythologian's.  As a fan, I thought the film could have done better without the computer generated sidekick, Jar Jar, and the Gangan race.  I didn't mind the other cg characters or its use in set design as much, because they were used to show a wide variety of aliens existing and give a sense of monolithic proportions, but with Jar Jar, it was more of a thorn in a wonderfully crafted Star Wars universe, whether done by Lucas or Dark Horse Comics.  In comparison, the cute bunny-rat like creatures in the Marvel Comics Star Wars universe were more acceptable.",1
1997,5.0,"As a Star Wars fan myself, I do feel as if bias could have clouded my judgment of this movie. For that reason, I will split my review into a review of the movie and its role in the Star Wars saga, and a review of the overall quality of the movie as a whole.",0

Ok, let's get rollin' here...  2 Jedi Knights are sent to help a Queen save her world from high taxes, and end up finding a young boy who has The Force.  Well, aside from being a Paper-Thin plot, many of the characters seem as if they were written by an idiot.  Darth Maul is BY FAR the single most interesting character in the entire film, and we only get ONE LINE OF DIALOG, and 10 minutes of screen time.  Samuel L. Jackson, one of the great actors working today, is on the screen for approximately the same amount of time, also.  So I get stuck watching a half-wit, half-written, no-brainer character like Jar-Jar for most of the film??  God, save me from bad plot LOOPHOLES and moronic dialog!!  Even Ewan and Liam seemed like they didn't even want to be there...and any director that can suck all the charisma out of Ewan obviously needs to go back to film school.",0
1999,,"It was no ""New Hope"", nor an ""Empire"", and not even a ""Jedi"" but ""The Phantom Menace"" was in fact a 3 star movie that thrilled certain members of the audience, but not me.  Maybe i expected more from the movie, but I believed certain special effects hindered the movie at times.  ""Menace"" had its share of difficulties; Jar Jar Binks, the two headed race announcer, the trade federation bad guys and the underwater city, all these factors hindered the ability that this movie had to gain prosperity in the film world.  The plot was a good one (I won't give it away), the battle scene between the droids and the Jar Jars(?) was great and the final light saber battle-all were entertaining and I think any fan of the Star Wars trilogy should without a doubt see it.  Jake Lloyd's acting was below par, while Ewan MacGregor's was great.  See it for yourselves though and relive the adventure.  3 stars out of 4. - Jake Klim",1
2000,6.0,"I started out on this movie with an 8 out of 10 rating but after I saw it two more times I am sorry to say that I now have it at a 6.  I found it to be good overall but most of the exhilaration of a new ""Star Wars"" after 20 years wore off after I saw the movie again.  The story was good overall but had some problems (I don't want to get into a rabid Star Wars debate so I'll spare you).  There was a decent amount of action too, and the special effects (in particular the pod race) set a new standard for high quality. My biggest problem in this story was character development.  It's been my experience that most of the people that disagree with me on that point have read the books.  I am sure that to those of you who have read the books would probably agree, but I feel like Lucas was trying to do too much with this story and didn't have enough time to develop everyone fully.  That leads me to my conclusion:  I firmly believe that Star Wars, Episode 2 will be a 10 out of 10 movie.  The stage has been set for some great storyline, which was part of the reason I felt Episode 1 was lacking -- it had to set up the storyline for the entire Star Wars dynasty.",0

2002,7.0,"Although ""The Phantom Menace"" was a great experience to see on screen, with 600 other people all equally excited to see the film, it doesn't nearly live up to ""A New Hope"".  Which is why one should go into this film with NO expectations.  If you go in, thinking it's not going to be very good, it won't be.  If you go in expecting ""A New Hope"", you'll be disappointed. So just go in with NO expectations, and it'll be fun.  There were some GREAT aspects to the film, as there were equally particularly bad aspects.  The greatest part about the film was Darth Maul.  Great to watch, and just had SO much stage presence.  But the worst character was the all-CGI Jar Jar Binks.  Most annoying (and painful) character to watch on-screen.  Half the time you don't understand what he's saying, and when you do understand, it's not funny.  And the CGI-element was like watching a really bad version of Roger Rabbit (interacting with live-action).  The fight sequences were great (due, once again, to Darth Maul), and the race sequence with Anakin was a blast.  But the plethora of cameos (from Samuel L. Jackson to the guy who played ""Willow"") was a bit distracting at times.  It wasn't the same as watching actors you've never seen on screen before delivering great one-liners and interacting with each other.  The effects were cool (epitome of ""eye candy""), and overall a fun film to watch to go along with the ride. Especially if you're really familiar with the intricate storylines, and how they will develop (from Amidala and Anakin to the rise of Senator Palpatine).  See in a big crowded theatre with a big bunch of fanatics, and let your brain go.",1
2003,,"""SW:TPM"" rivals the first flick as my fav- (though the OVER-abundance of whimsical characters makes me almost yetch). And Jar-Jar gets tired. One sequence that has NOT been ballyhooed is tremendous (and...wet). The young Anakin is a bit too young- the kid is barely in the ""kid"" age. Young Anakin (Jake Lloyd) is fun to see, but he's too young for a lot of this. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala- she's too weak at times. I had noticed this in the trailers. She simply does not engage my allegiance to fight for her to the death. She does pull off much of the flic though.",1
2004,8.0,"After a wait of sixteen years Lucas has delivered the beginning installment of what has become the American epic saga.  The first thing I have to say is that the movie is not the best episode of the series, nor is it the worst. As far as the existing trilogy goes, this one rates above Return of the Jedi but falls short of The Empire Strikes Back.  I would personally place it neck-and-neck with A New Hope.  However, since in 1977 A New Hope completely revolutionized the science-fiction genre The Phantom Menace will never be remembered in as high esteem.  The movie itself consists almost completely of  foreshadowing to both the existing trilogy and what Lucas plans to do in episodes 2 and 3.  As such, this movie has fallen prey to a slew of bad press.  The people responsible for giving such negative media to the film have made a grievous error in judgement.  This movie should not be taken on its own as a film, but must be taken in context with its surrounding story line.  This movie was the action-packed opening chapter of the saga, much as A New Hope was in 1977.  Unfortunately such expectation has been heaped upon Menace that it could not possibly have delivered all that was desired.  By the release of the third episode, Menace will be respected in its rightful place of the opening sentences of the story, taking the first few steps toward a complex plot spanning a total of six movies.  If the critics today are berating the story as they are simply because the movie does not deliver all the answers, imagine how these same critics would have rated Empire. Then again, critics were never very adept at noticing or appreciating such complexities.",0
2005,7.0,"The Phantom Menace is a good movie. It is above average and worth the money to see I guess. Unfortunately, it does not have any of the Star Wars Magic; no cool characters, no interesting dialogue, no funny in-fighting. The special effects are as much what is wrong with the film as they are what actually makes it worth watching. The effects are so over used that the movie looses any sense of human-ness that was what made the original trilogy so special. George Lucas apparently does not trust his actors enough to let them in on any of the details while filming is actually taking place and the effect is clearly seen onscreen. The actors do not know what is going to be edited into the scenes and do not know how to react to what may or may not be there.",0

Bad casting and poor acting are my major gripes with the film, however, with not one role being played by an appropriate actor. Natalie Portman was positively wooden, as if the experience of being in ""Episode I"" had frightened her into utter stiffness. Darth Maul, the only character with some intrigue, is barely in the movie. The one sequence that woke me up was the pod-race, which reminded me of George Lucas' love for hot rods and drag racing, and made me wish he would go back to making movies like ""American Graffiti"", with wonderful, real people, cool cars, and not a monster in sight.

If you look at Star Wars (IV) you can clearly see the writing is awful and the direction is juvenile. This is why the others were written and directed by other people. These films were better. Indiana Jones was terrific. Lucas came up with the stories for these legends and let others write and direct. He's a great idea man. But he's just no good at anything else.

John Williams score is sadly, the worst of the series, although he manages to create two memorable tunes- Duel of Fates and Trade Federation March- but most of his score is more suited to a schmaltzy TV Movie.

There was a fair bit of location shooting and sets that were not just blue screens (The conveyor belt in AOTC!)

I have no problem with the rest of the movie or any of the staple features of this film. I see that many people focus on hating Jar Jar Binks over personal issues when he is not bad like they claim he is. I get the twin main points of the movie that no one is born evil and that what happens to one will effect the other which I totally agree with.

Characters of substance whom I cared about blended with marvelous special effects to produce a true classic. That is Star Wars , ""The Phantom Menace "" is not. There is not a character here one cares for. Scotsman McGregor and Irishman Nessson are forced to adopt British accents for their role as Jedi Knights. Neeson sounds bored and McGregor come off sounding like Sir Hillary Whittittle. With their bored new age platitudes they seem less guardians of the universe than organic tofu salesman. The so called comic relief of Jar Jar is best left forgotten. One would of thought that the civil rights movement had banished such blatant stereotyping. Comments about Anakin Skywalker will be left out lest I be accused of child abuse. The pod race sequence is a rip off of the chariot race from ""Ben Hur"" right down to John Williams composing a Miklos Rozaish Roman march. The look of the film is spectacular but the core and substance of this film, the thing that made the originals classics, is glaringly hollow. Mr. Lucas has revealed another side of the Force.

With the notable exception of Jake Lloyd, most of the actors in this film are exceptionally wooden. The visuals are stunning, but I want a reason to root for the characters BESIDES the fact that I  know what happens in the other movies. Well, at least I can take solace in the fact that this film is NOT going to pass ""Titanic"" like everyone predicted. That honor will go to ""A New Hope"" which was made when Lucas remembered that characters were more important than visual effects....",0

Liam Neeson was great as Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor was also good as the younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman was a terrific Queen Amidala, although it was a little bogus to find out that the elaborately dressed up queen was actually the decoy.  Jake Lloyd...well, I guess he was okay...he wasn't as good as the others and he seemed to over-accentuate his lines.  But, he is only ten so I guess everyone should just give him a break.  Other character developments were also interesting, Senator Palpatine is obviously the future Emperor of the Darkside.  The film tried not to show this but the audience could tell anyway.  Jar Jar Binks was at times a funny comic relief character, and at other times was just flat out annoying.  The only character that was way too shallow was Darth Maul, who only had a few lines and pretty much had the personality of a toothpick.",1

The only good part of the film was the good acting from Liam Neeson! And then they had Neeson play second fiddle to some kid named Jake Lloyd! I think the film SHOULD HAVE BEEN focused on the characters of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, and I think the storyline should have been about them hiding Queen Padme in a hidden fortress or something on Naboo!

And therein lies the interest in this film.  In all honesty it could not stand on its own as a separate movie.  Why?

I am not the first one to say that the writing could have been better, the direction more full of well, direction and the acting this time around won't garner any Oscars (Especially that truly unemotional last scene by Neeson) but as far as summer movies go I feel that this is head and shoulders above all the Will Smith's and Godzilla's in the world.  This movie left you with plenty of wanting for more, yes, but that is part of its purpose.  Knowing that he IS going to make three Lucas was not threatened to tell too much at once although maybe he could have.  Remember this is just the beginning and just like the two sequels of the original trilogy do a lot for the original Star Wars so (I trust) will the next two sequels do for this film.  The effects are unstoppable and flawless unlike other summer movies that claim the same but don't live up to it.  Star Wars lived up to what Star Wars is;  It's fun, food for the eyes that leave you very filled yet craving more.  Only this meal will have to last you another two or so years before the great appetizers (trailers, toys books and rumors) start to gently tickle the palette and get everything geared again.  What Star Wars brings to the screen that many other summer movies doesn't (i.e.  M.I.B. Godzirra and ID:4) is such an incredible sense of realism, imagination and wonder.  Its eye candy just like the rest of the crowd but it stands above and beyond because of its magic and yes, perhaps some of its magic today can be traced back to the original trilogy but I can assure that ten years from now when the children today are nearing there twenties or in there twenties (As I am) they'll remember Star Wars in far more detail than MIB or ID:4 and definitely Godzirra!

Nor does the movie seem as flat, especially at the beginning.  (The first time round, Phantom Menace may seem like the world's most boring buddy movie for the first 30 minutes or so.)  And you start to notice many more details.  You start to see lots more of those cool robot racks.  You start to wonder things about the next two episodes.

I was by no means a zealous fan of the series, having only seen the movies once or twice, but nevertheless it was quite obvious that this movie would have an incredible impact on the movie-going audience and be remembered as a great film of my (teenage, post Gen-X) generation. I first saw the The Phantom Menace the Friday after it had opened with a bunch of my friends. I sat for two hours jaw agaped at what were the most visually stunning effects I had ever seen. I left the movie thinking it was ""a cool flick"" that was worth five bucks and a bit of my free time. A few weeks later I wondered if I had truly appreciated the film or even taken some serious thought as to whether or not it was just another big hype, bad script, poor acting, makin' millions blockbuster that I had for such a long time dreaded. That was when I went back to the theater. After hearing and reading so many praises and bad criticisms, I had to find out for myself. By the end of it all, I walked out of the theater very pleased with what I had just seen. As for the writing, I can see where some would find many moments a little sappy, but they were more necessary than I at first thought. The plot was interesting and was what I thought was rather well structured. The actors did a wonderful job, especially McGregor and Portman. These two young actors brought believable emotion to the film at times which it was necessary but seemingly impossible to pull off. All of this of course is, as I said earlier, topped off with some of the coolest eye candy ever. I loved it, hype and all.",1

The movie is entertaining enough; the key pod-racing scene is a brilliant set piece; Liam Neeson's leading performance is excellent; the character of Anakin is original, enormously appealing and beautifully cast in the person of Jake Lloyd; the designs are gorgeous if overstuffed and the special effects are state-of-the-art.  But the movie is nearly ruined by its most remarkable technical accomplishment: that intergallactic hybrid of Roger Rabbit and Step'n'Fetchit, Jar Jar Binks.  Most of all, its thin story lacks any of the mythic richness of the first trilogy, and the characters, with the possible exception of Anakin, are barely introduced as paper cut-outs compared with the characters of the first three movies, and their relationships get no more interesting than the over-obvious effort to foreshadow the future of Anakin and Queen Amidala.  Still, there is cause to hope that in the next two movies Lucas will turn enough of his attention away from his special effects to give full-bodied life to the new chapters of his great cinematic epic.",1

2057,2.0,"My whole life, I have been a Star Wars fan. I can see it for what it is: a fun and exhilarating collection of stories about heroes, villains, and intergalactic wars. As a child, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar was funny. Pod racing was cool. And perhaps the epic battle between Kenobi and Maul at the end of the film tricked me into thinking that the movie itself was great, and not a total disaster. In my mind, it could not be better. But then, I grew up.<br /><br />Now, I can confidently state that The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars film there is. Let's be honest; it's boring, long, the dialogue is pathetic, and Darth Maul is a scary villain who doesn't really do much besides pop up at the end for a lightsaber battle that saves the movie's third act. Most people, pre-sequels, were in agreement that it's an objectively bad film that offers a half-decent introduction to the beloved story that George Lucas introduced with A New Hope, but if you watch it on its own and examine it for what it is-A FILM-you'll see that it's just not very good. Lucas went from churning out stories about a group of charismatic misfits in outer space fighting to end the cruel regime of space-nazis, to writing a movie about... what exactly? The taxing of trade routes? Even the CLIMAX of the movie, a droid vs Gungan battle, presents a fight on THE MOST lifeless and boring terrain I've ever seen, and yet, the shots still appear cluttered. I've heard people claim that Jar Jar ""ruins"" the movie, but in all seriousness, he is the only part of the film that isn't horrifically lifeless and stale. The only thing that reminds me I'm alive and haven't awoken in hell whilst watching the movie is Jar Jar's snippets of dialogue that pull me back down to earth. I just simply don't care about the characters and what they're talking about, making each conversation even more tedious than the last. Even Obi-Wan Kenobi, one of my favorite characters of all time and one of the bread-and-butter characters of the saga and The Clone Wars Series (which, coincidentally, is the show that SAVED his character), is mind-numbingly dull, showing very little emotion up until his master is slain. So, I stand by my thesis that Jar Jar is the most entertaining character in the movie-the only character that makes me feel anything besides dead inside.<br /><br />This is not a good movie. It has no merits. It is boring, overly long, and just so...flat. I will never understand how a fleet of fans are now flocking back to the very movies they once<br /><br />mercilessly hated after the release of the sequels. I don't care what everyone else says-every single sequel that's been put out is several steps above each prequel (and yes, that includes Revenge of The Sith). Quit whining about the The Last Jedi and stick with The Phantom Menace for all I care, and have fun watching the Senate negotiate trade routes. :)",0

Granted the first three films were silly and the acting was a little off but they were FUN! But I'll give credit where credit is due. Set design, costume design, creature makeup and certain other CGI effects were really terrific. Good job Mr. Lucas! But ""The Phantom Menace"" suffers from mediocre acting, a so-so storyline and...and...........Jar Jar Binks??? Why do we need more comic relief? C-3PO and R2-D2 are more than enough. The look of Jar Jar was fine but his character should have mirrored the ferocity yet loyal friendship of Chewbacca. The film needed a darker and harder edge to appeal to those of us who grew up on the first 3 films but who also aren't kids anymore. (Remember ""The Empire Strikes Back""?). Great special effects aren't going to be enough for those of us who made it through the blockbuster filled 80's.

Their relationship thus far has been limited to the fact that Anakin is only in his pre-teens, but it will grow and become an integral part of the next two prequels. George Lucas needs to be commended in bringing this BEAUTIFUL world of his to life in a manner that no one has ever seen before. Do yourself a favor and check out the wonderful vistas that are presented here. Under water cities and vast desert scapes are all alive with an array of different species that have become a trademark of the Star Wars Saga. Liam and Ewan are great Jedi knights that are believable and absolutely fun to watch. The Jedi reign is in full force here. Oh, let's not forget the music!! John William's score from beginning to end adds so much more to the action, that we are pulled into this universe which makes this movie so much more. Bravo. And Darth Maul.....what a EVIL villain. His mere presence would make anyone want to run and find the nearest Jedi, so he could kick his butt. The one dude that really annoyed me was(say it with me now), Jar-Jar Binks. His speech is at times so incomprehensible, it can become distracting. I'm sure the young ones will want to have a Jar-Jar all their own, and that is because he is completely a ""living"" cartoon. In that respect, he is a success. Let's not forget the phantom menace itself. What a great setup for the next two films.  Finally, I would like to say that it is not up to snuff with the existing trilogy, but it is an EXTREMELY welcomed addition to the whole saga. Just sit and get ready to be blown away by the ""STAR WARS"" emblem and the famous John William's score; it's definitely worth the price of admission.

The story was adequate for what Lucas set out to accomplish, but there were many scenes that seem to be just thrown in there to show off the computer images. THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE PLOT AND THAT IS MY MAJOR GRIPE ABOUT THIS FILM. Don't try to dazzle me with images. Make my want to see it again by telling a story that is hard to forget with interesting dialogue and compelling characters. The casting was dead on; you couldn't ask for a better queen or a little Skywalker. The Jedi Knights, Qui Gon and Obi Wan were great also........but some of the things they have to say are sometimes laughable. I love Star Wars movies; I really do. I just wanted more, and the hype that surrounds this movie will only prove to hinder its success. Episode II will be better; George Lucas has given us a taste of what's to come, and if he can develop an engrossing story with truly satisfying revelations, EVERYONE will love it, guaranteed.

But I soon realized that I felt a feeling of great disappointment to say the least. For one, the characters are not even nearly as likeable or as original as Luke, Han or Vader were. The story was very mixed-up feeling and kind of had me thinking ""what the heck is going on"" throughout the film. I can't deny the fact that the visuals are very nice, but---this was the first movie that I actually wished they had used regular models in some scenes. The CG sometimes feel just that--computer made and very unlifelike. Even the music, was a little disappointing (John Williams has only done this once before, the very poor score for Lost World made me wonder if he had lost his touch). WARNING!!!--The character Jar Jar is by far, the worst example of a character in a movie created so the kids would have something to laugh at. He is annoying, adds nothing to the story and basically is a tag-along that does not belong anywhere in this movie. I'm still hoping his role in the next installment is a small one--very small. I actually have two ratings for this movie----on it's own, I'll give it a 5. But---if you want to compare and include this with the original trilogy, it receives a very low 3.",0

Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan were just performed like the actors really had the force & no one else could play Queen Amidala better than rising star Natalie Portman. But the most surprised portrayal was of Young Anakin played by Jake Lloyd who I heard couldn't act at all.  Nice cameos by Yoda, Jabba the Hutt, R2 & C-3PO as well.  I would most definitely recommend this movie if you haven't seen it already.  It is worth all the hype that it has received.",1
2072,10.0,I liked this movie a lot it had a lot of cool si-fi action.  The sound in the movie was really good and the acting was also well done.  I liked the light sabor battle at the end that was the best scene in the whole movie. I think that any one who loves star wars has got to see Episode I NOW!  It is a lot better to see it on the big screen than to see it on home video.  I can not wait on till 2002 when Star Wars Episode II comes out.  I give this movie **** out of ****,1
2073,,"This was easily the most anticipated film of my life, and I have to say I was not disappointed.  After hearing scathing reviews from critics didn`t help things though.  What an amazing film!  How can you totally badmouth such cracking entertainment?!?!  I have NEVER seen anything like that pod race, and when that can be upstaged in the same film by a three-way climax that this film had  wow  No bad performances among them, even Jar Jar, who everyone seems to hate: me & my friends thought he was great!  Watto was also fantastic  scum of the highest order. As a matter of fact, there was not one character I disliked.  I didn`t know the plot, having somehow avoided all talk about it until I saw the film, and it was well worth it for that ending It`s Star Wars for a new generation, not to be compared with the original trilogy as so many special effects breakthroughs have happened since 1983.  One small gripe though; not enough of the villains.. But besides that small criticism; see it, be totally amazed, then see it again !!!!!",1
2074,10.0,"I wish not to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, so I won't, But, to say the least...THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE.  People who constantly ""dog"" or criticize Star Wars aren't true movie goers or lovers. These mindless critics need to first understand film in order to appreciate it, and someone who instantly regards the film as pointless and bad truly does not comprehend the art of what George Lucas is trying to bring to his audience. Lucas is a creative dreamer, these are fantasies and dreams of his inner child. He has made them as realistic as possible in order to entertain( at free will) society across the Globe, and whether you like Star Wars or not, you need to appreciate this film, as well as the other three. Star Wars is for Lucas  like Goonies is for Spielberg. Its a story, and not every one may like it, but if you don't, then come up with something better.",1
2075,10.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Unlike some of the negative reviews this movie has gotten, it is Star Wars. From start to finish this movie lived up to my expectations. I loved it and have seen it 7 times in 4 days. It is an excellent addition and probably the third best in the series (Empire being the best followed by Star Wars), which is not a bad thing when it is the greatest trilogy to grace the silver screen.",1
2076,9.0,"The reviews about this film have been mixed; several people have said that it lacks severely, but I disagree. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace proved to me that there is still magic left in the movies. There is also something in it that I found very enjoyable: a distinct lack of cynicism. Movies and television shows today, especially comedies, are so cynical that it seriously gets on my nerves sometimes. It's nice to see something with even a slightly uplifting outlook on life, considering the fact that movies such as the ""The Matrix"" (which was excellent) have had a distinctly unhappy, depressing view of society. Granted, the script isn't great, but has it ever been?  Part of the fun of the Star Wars series is the ""gee-whiz"" type of script that all of the films have had.  You aren't going to find anything deep or profound, but you are going to find that you are having a good deal of fun just sitting back and watching.  One last thing: Jar-Jar. Jar-Jar is the movie's only real bane; they should have simply taken out the Chewbacca-type role and not have had him in there. He adds nothing to the story, and succeeds only in appealing to the very young. Despite this small fact, ""Phantom Menace"" entertains, and proves that the best movies are the ones that are fun to watch.  You can bet that I'm going back to this one.",1
2077,,"Forty minutes into ""Stars Wars: Episode 1--The Phantom Menace"" one character, eyeing the impending storm announces: ""it's very bad.""  True to form the storm along with the rest of the movie appears to live up to this apt description as well.  Bland, derivative, and sophomoric ""The Phantom Menace"" is strictly a by-the-numbers movie conceived by focus groups and corporate executives--a deadly combination that probably robbed the film of its life force and a singular, coherent vision.  Trying to be all things to all people the latest installment of the ""Star Wars"" saga is indeed a bloodless creation totally devoid of heart and soul.  The Force must have taken a wrong turn, landed in Toysarus and applied for permanent residency.  Someone should remind  Mr. Lucas that a movie and a movie-tie-in are not the same thing at all.  It is therefore unsurprising that ""The Phantom Menace"" is long on special effects and short on wit and imagination.  It is so attuned to the millennium angst that it seems to be manufactured more by computers than man.  It is as if the entire human population has been effectively shut out of the filmmaking process.  Computers 1.  Man 0.  Phantom menace rules.",0
2078,,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Amidala is cooler than Leia, Qui-Gon cooler than the old guy Obi-Wan, ect. What I mean is, these characters are better than the originals. Some people didn't like the movie because they tried to make it more enjoyable for kids. Being a kid, I disagree. I like the movie BETTER than the originals for that reason! Anyway, my advice:If you are, even in the tiniest bit, a Star Wars fan, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! It's great for kids, too. Ya-hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
2079,3.0,"I saw this movie on the second day it was open. Packed theater, enthusiastic, young crowd. Everyone psyched. By the end of the film, I had nearly fallen asleep twice, and not once, NOT ONCE, did the film get anything like a cheer or gasp or ANYTHING out of the audience. I'm sure most people love this film bec. it's Star Wars so there is sentimental attachment from childhood and all that. But the truth is this film was a big wad of nothing. I didn't care about anyone in the film, the acting was wooden, the effects were gratuitous (i.e. there for show and not much else) ... my list of complaints goes on and on. I'm not a critic (not professionally anyway), so listen to me when I say this movie bites. But you'll see it anyway. Actually, you probably already have. If we could all admit that Star Wars is not about the movies anymore, but about selling badly made plastic products and/or soda to children, then we could cease arguing about the film bec. its artistic merit would be beside the point.

2080,10.0,"I have to say that if people think that they know more about Star Wars than George Lucas himself, not to mention LucasArts, they should just go and try to make their own Star Wars movie which they feel would better this one. I was extremely satisfied with everything this movie delivered from start to finish and could not find anything as bad as people like to spout. Yes, I am a Star Wars fan and I follow it a bit but to put this movie down based upon so many idiotic nitpicks is truly disgraceful. The only major flaw I can think of was Jar Jar Binks which was extremely embarrassing to watch in a film like this. But even so, this movie gives everything a fan could ask for and those naysayers should simply shut it.",0
2081,,"Krumski from Cincy, Ohio made a good point about the best action in Eps. IV - VI blindsiding you; with that in mind, I'm surprised more people haven't commented on the first view we get of the Gungan underwater city, hanging precariously in the deep. That's the one moment in this film that had my jaw on the floor, the lightsaber duel coming in a close second. I have to agree that this film could have used more heart and a Han Solo archetype to balance out the seriousness; perhaps those two would go hand-in-hand.  It's an entertaining film, but not much more than that.  One final thought:  a lot of people, including author Peter David, are bitching about how the midi-chlorians have invalidated the whole spiritual basis of the Force.  Has anyone thought that it might be a great big red herring?  Think how silly you'll feel if I'm right.  Thank you for reading and may the Force be with you 'til Episode II.",1

If I had not seen Episodes IV, V and VI and hadn't expected some connection with that universe I would, perhaps, have liked it more. But it was mainly an excuse for showing off some (I have to admit, very good) special effects. Taken alone, it would have been more enjoyable, but more along the lines of action movies than science-fiction ones. Frankly, I had expected more of this one.",1
2083,,"For once I have to agree with the critics. I truly say I feel the sorriest for all those people who waited 6 weeks out of Mann's Chinese Theatre, cause they surely must have felt like they had egg on their face after watching this nightmare. OK, question #1... Why was that planet being cut off from trade? Was this ever answered? Question #2... Why is Darth Maul only in this movie for upwards of 8 minutes while Jar Jar is in practically every scene? Question #3, why does Darth Maul's make up look so bad under the lights? Including those Rite Aid devil horns that you can see molded to his head? Makes no sense. I knew when they showed up on the desert planet it would be drawn out & boring (like Ep. IV) but to have ET in at as well?!? C'mon! The only redeeming quality of this film is the score and sound effects. Ok also the gungan people, asian accent bad guys & Ewan...but only for unintentional humor",0
2084,10.0,"For all the people who are complaining about this movie, I would just like to point out that you are the people who never cared for the other three in the first place.  You just got caught up in the ""hype"" and didn't want to be left out.  So you jumped on the ""cool"" bandwagon and started talking about how always loved the first three, thinking you had us fans fooled, but we knwe.  You know how?  We ask you what you thought of the Phantom Menade after you watched it.  And when someone started saying how ""it didn't go anywhere"" or ""it just kind of ended with no real resolution"" or ""JarJar Binks was nothing but comic relief"", we know you are just jumping on the bandwagon.",0

Luckily I was pleasantly surprised and overall enjoyed a good film, all though some of my fears were true, mainly in George Lucas's failure to keep certain important elements of his original trilogy.",1
2087,1.0,"Considering that George Lucas has not directed a feature in 22 years, it's not surprising that while, SWTPM, has its share (more than its share) of effects, it's very short on plot or acting.  Most of the actors looked confused and more wooden than the robots they communicate with.  (Samuel L. Jackson looks to be in the wrong movie entirely.)  It's a shame that someone with the vision of Lucas has so little ability to see that vision come to life.  In two or three years, the film will be completely forgotten.  In fact, during the screening I saw in Hollywood, the audience pretty much went to sleep after their initial excitement at the first twenty minutes or so. The loudest reaction was for C3PO and R2D2. Truly a disappointment and not a very worthy sequel to such a film as ""The Empire Strikes Back"", which was really a breathtaking film.",0
2088,,"I wont lie...when this movie first came out I had super high expectations for it. I am a fan of Star Wars, but not a historian where I know the names of everyone and thier starships creators. HOWEVER..unlike many fans of the series, I also kept an open mind that we werent going to be seeing familar grounds. For example, yes, Yoda was there, Obi Wan-Kenobi was there, and so was the force and Lightsabers.  Not there, was Darth Vader..he was still a boy, and the Emperor had yet to rise to power. I thought it was great way to throw us into the beginning..just like A New Hope throughs us into the middle of the saga. We are introduced to the Jedi Knights for the first time and their simplistic life style which is similar to that of the old Samurai warrior. (which is where Lucas got the concept I hear).",1
2089,,"This movie is not the worst in the history of theater. It isn't even the worst of 99. It is a decent movie that had to live up to the impossible dream of that which is the Star Wars Trilogy. So many people have grown up with those movies as a staple that it was almost destined that Episode 1 would disappoint. Not that Lucas helped himself with a certain CGI character named Jar Jar (shudder). But annoying sidekicks and bad child acting aside, this movie had some great moments. The pod race was excellent, albeit long, and the final battle soundly put all the others in the previous movies to shame. Ewan McGregor is an excellent actor who really did embody my vision of a young Obi-Wan. If only there had been more of him and less Jar Jar. I can't wait to see him more in the second and third movie. Natalie Portman too was a good choice, but under used. You hardly knew her, so you hardly cared. And let's face it, this part of the saga really isn't all that exciting, things don't really start moving until Anakin grows up. All in all, Lucas did make some blunders, but they could have been much worse, and I for one eagerly await the rest of the first trilogy.",0
2090,8.0,"It's hard to understand tastes of american people, especially if you are living in Ukraine. I still can't understand the ""greatness"" of episodes 4, 5 and 6. It's not even a science fiction really, it's just a comics, filled with GREAT soundtrack ! I'm quote George Lucas : "" The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie"". OK, that's right , but only in HIS movies !!! I must say that entertaining in episodes 4,5,6 are sound and music at 95% ! The Phantom Menace is the best from Star Wars - it has strong perfomances ( Liam Neeson, Jake Lloyd and Pernilla August ), beautiful cinematography, excellent special effects and GREAT music by John Williams ( as always ). It also has weak script and VERY  WEAK direction by Lucas ( as always ), but these things don't stop me from seeing this TALE again and again only to hear that genius music.

2091,1.0,"I have been a fan of the Star Wars movies since the original trilogy. Both Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are among my all-time favorite movies, and like others, I had anxiously awaited the fourth movie....But time -- and other movies (The Matrix, Batman [1989], Independence Day, Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, Fargo, etc.) tempered my interest. I only had a minor interest in seeing this movie, but now I have, and unfortunately, it is not only worst than the long and loud Return of the Jedi, but is one of the most pathetic movies I've seen in a long time. This is a sad example of what happens when you have too much money and spfx on your hands -- and not a clue to what makes a decent plot. Lucas has had nearly 20 years to develop a story, and instead fell way short. The screenplay is more serious than a Biblical epic, and with fewer laughs. The story did not keep my attention, and left me empty and feeling nothing. These characters - unlike their predecessors - were so distant, I didn't care what happened to any of them. I felt no emotion when Anakin and his mother part; or none when the Neeson character is killed. I wanted to know more about Darth Maul, but was told nothing. And the pod race (which went on and on and on....) was practically lifted from Ben-Hur. The fabulous Samuel L. Jackson was quite wasted, as was Neeson. The least said about Jake Lloyd the better; as a movie buff, I've seen dozens of more talented child actors. Jar-Jar Binks was annoying, but not overly objectionable, for his human counterparts performed - for the most part - worst than the puppet did. I had hoped for more from McGregor and Portman, but after over 2 hours, no longer cared. The final scene - reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the first SW movie - was more pitiful than happy. It is regrettable that this is what Lucas has offered after all these years, and I can only feel sad in thinking that his next 2 movies will likely be more of the same. He'll just slap Star Wars in the title -- and they will come. But not me.",0
2092,4.0,"I wasn't sure what was worse Jar Jar Binks or Jake Lloyds acting, maybe George Lucas' script, in any case his special effects are again amazing and the impersonation Ewan Macgregor does of Alec Guiness is well done, but Darth Maul gets killed too quickly and he had the most appeal of anyone in the picture.  And he flawlessly delivered his one line with Perfection, ""Yes Master""  other than that I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a glutton for punishment.",0
2093,7.0,"Although an extremely annoying performance from young Anakin and Jar Jar, Neeson plays the fatherly role well, to both Anakin and Obi-wan, and Maul is possibly the best villain of all-time (not just because of the double- bladed lightsaber!).",0

The story was a bit hard to follow and the only real interesting part, at least for me, was the fact that we were just meeting Anakin for the first time in the saga. Jake Lloyd, the boy who played Anakin, wasn't the best person for the part. I think George Lucas could've picked a much better actor for his role. I think the best acting in this movie was Ewan and Liam (Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon). It's too bad that Qui-Gon eventually dies. And Ewan did a great job as Obi-Wan. He had to live up to Alec Guiness's work and I think he succeeded. (Alec Guiness played the old Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars-A New Hope) Overall, it was an OK movie.",0

2098,5.0,"The Phantom Menace is considered by many(and me)one of the worst Star Wars films.The movie was a huge disappointment at the time but it became a huge box office success.It suffers from a lot of problems like the over use of CGI,(unlike the Original Trilogy's breath taking practical effects)a plot that is based mostly on hilarious politics and the biggest problem of them all is the extremely annoying character of Jar Jar Binks that became the mot hated character among Star Wars fans.It also has a big subplot about a federation space station in the third act that is quite similar to A New Hope.I think that the film is not awful but mediocre and has some quality in it.I enjoyed Ewan McGregor's performance a lot. I also liked Liam Neeson in the movie.The only character that was kind of developed in the movie was Anakin(he wasn't three dimensional but he at least had a backstory that made him lovable)The villain was one dimensional but he was awesome.( I know that this is not a good film argument but it's still a fact)By far the best part of the movie was the last fight sequence which it was incredibly well choreographed and was incredibly fun and the John Williams score especially the Duel Of The Fates(which it was used in the last fight sequence I talked about).Overall the movie is mediocre to bad and if you are not a Star Wars fan you shouldn't spend your time watching this movie.",0
2099,,"Okay, perhaps I'm guilty of breaking the cardinal rule when it comes to blockbusters: expecting a good script.

And then, he helped major studio companies to rape this kids with incredible amount of garbage that poured on the screen, while he himself always stayed on a distance from it. Now, 22 years later, his naive children still want to believe their father loves them. They are awaiting for new trilogy as little kids for the affection. They didn't notice that their father raped them again, this time himself, with Jar Jar Binks and little Jake Lloyd and whatever it is he put in the movie. They are in such a denial, that while some of them are so blind they pretend they loved the movie, others aren't dumb enough to do so, they pretend that this was a mistake, and next films are gonna correct it. Epsiode one was surrounded by so much hype, it's practically impossible to distinguish the movie itself. It's probably the average film, not too bad, not too good.

Putting in a character solely for comic relief. (You know who!) Writing a story that's driven by action, instead of by characters. Star Wars was the work of a true storyteller. The Phantom Menace was ruled by merchandising. George Lucas has crossed over.",0

Only the ending scenes evoked any emotion for me. Even the ""dramatic"" conclusion of the light saber battle left me hollow and not caring. The actors were very talented, but why did they seem like they were sleep walking? And unfortunately the critics were right: Anakin was badly miscast, almost dragging the whole notion of the prequel into doubt. The one task episodes I-III must do is to portray and dramatize the tragedy of Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader. In order for this to work we must care deeply for Anakin.

I was not prepared for the Jar Jar character, and I probably payed too much attention to him - the next time around I was prepared, and the movie was much more balanced and thoroughly entertaining.  Is Phantom Menace as good as the originals?  Its really impossible to say - the original Star Wars transcended the screen and became a social phenomenon.  Phantom Menace can not and does not try to live up these standards - its impossible.  I think people have dumped on it because they expected a mystical experience - but as with many other movies, if you actively look for it you may miss it.  And don't forget that this move is part 1 of a new trilogy, who knows what Lucas has in store.  Would ""The Empire Strikes Back"" have been considered a good movie if ""Jedi"" hadn't followed it?  Before we reserve final judgement, lets see what George Lucas, a master storyteller, has to offer.",1

(I'm not saying that the original trilogy had BAD special effects, in fact they were great for their time, but... c'mon. C'MON. ... c'mon.) In fact the movie was so visually powerful that my eyes actually became glued to the screen. Unfortunately, my eyes were then confiscated by the theatre. Seriously, though, some of the original wonder and fantasy of Star Wars was lost in the powerful effects and visuals, but I'm sure that the young people of today, for whom The Phantom Menace is their first Star Wars, will think of the original trilogy as the one lacking in the goods. I just love the whole star wars universe. I can't get enough of reading about external characters and stories, especially the Jedi, and the Jedi council. But I rate movies by sheer entertainment. Therefore, the Matrix edged out Star Wars in pure entertainment, much as I thought it would. But the most entertaining movie of all time, and therefore THE greatest movie EVER, is still Fist of the North Star (english dubbed, 1986 animated version). The greatest movies all have their niches. Hamlet (Branagh version) was extremely powerful. Matrix was extremely entertaining. Star Wars was extremely technological and great. But in sheer entertainment, none can yet topple the sheer ecstasy and joy of watching Fist of the North Star. Please read my review of it, on the imdb. thank you. star wars rules.",1
2113,1.0,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, this movie had been the center of my attention for quite a while.  I feel I should add that George Lucas is the man for releasing this film on my birthday.  That aside, I am very happy with this film.  Of the original three films, it reminds me the most of Episode IV. It was more of an adventure movie than the previous ones.  My one complaint is that it was a little too directed at the kids for my taste.  I think that this film just would have been better without all the Jar-Jar stuff and the other silliness, which distracted from the good points of the movie: some great visuals, top-notch performances from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman, and the events that will be important in the next two movies.  Still, I expect that those problems will go away with the next two movies.  This movie left possibilities for the next two, many of them intriguing.  I can very easily see how Obi-Wan (probably my favorite character in the whole saga) became who he is in Episodes IV, V and VI, and how he was rash enough to lose Anakin to the Dark Side along the way.  I look forward to seeing how he -- and all of the major players -- develop.",1

In the end I think the result is  good, but I'm always wondering if it could been a little more consistent. The only plot interesting I can see is the plans and moves from a man who plays with the lives of thousands (humans or not) in search of absolute power. This is a film full of FX's in all splendor, but is sad that they don't make any advance to improve the storytelling, as other people comments I must say that many sequences of this movie are aimed to make video games and action figures. Other movie makers aim at this target and learned (I hope), that if you don't care the plot of the film in the first place you will have a LET DOWN, and then you can kiss goodbye to the revenues of the film-marketing. But we have another 2 films in the horizon, I hope things go up. The entertaining sequences to me were the battle of the Jedis, and the battle of Jar Jar Binks and his people against the droids.",1

People just expected so much more from it... but it's hard to top the trilogy, and I think Episode 1 did the best it could with the story. I really enjoyed the special effects (especially the scene with the sea monster, that was really cool)! And I LOVED the racing scene with Anakan Skywalker. No, it's not as good as the other ones, but I really liked it. It did seem to aim towards a younger crowd, but I think adults would still enjoy it.

2121,,"I saw Star Wars Episode 1 on opening day at 12:15am which was the second screening.  Being a big Star Wars fan, I was extremely excited in seeing this ""new"" Star Wars film.  After the movie, I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed.  The movie was fairly different from the other Star Wars films and I found Jar Jar Binks to be rather annoying.  Also, Nute Gunray and the Trade Federation ""aliens"" were given Asian accents and some of the Gungans were too.  Jar Jar's speech was poking fun of Blacks. Also, the movie simply didn't have to look and feel of the other Star Wars movies that made them so great.  That was my first impression when I viewed the movie in the theatre. I recently received the Widescreen edition of the Phantom Menace for my birthday.  So I thought, what the heck, why not watch it again.  I watched it again and then a few times more and now I have to say that I love it! It may not have the look and feel of the classic Star Wars series but hey, this is a ""new Star Wars film.""  The battles, especially between Obi Wan and Darth Maul were amazing.  So, my recommendation to those people who did not like the Phantom Menace is to beg them to watch the film again.  Like I said, I didn't like the film when I first viewed it either but if you give it a chance and watch it more than once you will realize just how strong the force is with this movie.",1
2122,,"Alright, one of the few good things that I can say about Episode I is that George stuck to the basics. No sex scenes, no graphic violence, and no strong language. Other than that, I felt like I sat through a movie that was geared more toward my five-year-old nephew that a lifelong Star Wars fan like myself. The title should have been something like 'Episode I: Yay! Star Wars for the Barely Potty Trained!' Don't get me wrong, I did watch the whole movie, have even watched it again when I caught it on HBO at three in the morning. It had great special effects. And wee Anakin is just adorable.

It was all of you who had to pay for tickets which became part of the 920,000,000$ that it made world wide. I think that this is a great movie and one of the best sci-fi movies ever. It is way better than the matrix and should have totally won best visual effects and best sound and sound effects editing way over the matrix.

This movie is more like Toy Story than Star Wars, I mean jeez! talk about an over-reliance on CGI. Lucas, you did it in the 70's and early 80's, why can't you do it now. Oh well, guess they don't make SFX like they used to... as for the characters, (the real ones, yes I know, there aren't many) no one really cares about them. I admit, Qui Gon was cool, and I really liked Darth Maul, but that little kid is just too cutesy to be a future Darth Vader. Haley Joel Osment would have been better, he's a better actor anyway. Obi-Wan is pretty stupid. Most of the movie he just follows Qui Gon around asking dumb questions. The Saber fights are cool but don't have the emotion that the older ones had. Hey, look, it's some guy with face paint and a lightsaber...let's fight him! Luke vs. Vader was the ultimate. One more thing, and someone said it before but it hit me when i first saw this...the technology in this movie far surpasses the original three, yet this one takes place 30 years before hand!

2130,7.0,"lol I was listening to the ""Queen"" song ""Bicycle Race"" the other day and the line Freddie Mercury sings about ""...'Jaws' ain't my scene and I don't like 'Star Wars'!"" reminded me that I had been meaning to throw the 6 DVDs in one more time for the 30th anniversary of the first (4th) film. When I saw this in the theatres in 1999 and later for my initial viewing at home on DVD I can't say that I gave this one much as far as points. But, alas, time heals all wounds and upon a further viewing some of the things that bothered me the first couple of times don't faze me as much these days. When YOU view this as the actual first film, as intended, and not the actual fourth being made and forget the history, etc. this actually becomes more appealing. Jar Jar Binks still doesn't work properly, though the CGI character is lovable. My qualms lie mostly with the half-ass, pardon my French, presentation of Patois / Japanese that Jar Jar and his fellow Goongans (lol) seem to be gibbering on about! In this viewing, I tried to view him like a child would with adoration and not with the reprimanding teacher mentality of my profession. I overlooked his faults and saw the ""Dumbo""-wannabe as simply a new character in a fictional world of characters. When looking at him in this light I noticed it worked more so than before. Nevertheless, there is some mastery here to be certain. The panoramic views are stunning and who cares if a computer came up with them? Utopian landscapes will always be a dream for any man who dares to dream. Annakin Skywalker a la Tom Sawyer and his pod-racing and saving the planet from destruction may be a bit far-fetched for some, but this is a story from the Fantasy realm, so why not? Natalie Portman in a double role does get tedious, but only supports the story. However, Samuel L. Jackson, and God (YHWH) knows that I am a fan of his acting, just seems out of place here. I keep waiting for an outburst or something like his other character roles, say ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"", ""Snakes On A Plane"" or ""Black Snake Moan"" of ""Damn it!"" or something to that effect, but am left unfulfilled like some needy wench in a trench. lol And speaking of loose ladies, Ewan McGregor coming off roles like in ""Velvet Goldmine"" really seems like a fish-out-of-water or some dork with his haircut, etc. here. lol Mark Hamill and his Tommy Shaw of ""Styx"" mane will be forever missed, certainly! I was also a bit miffed about how little time Ray Park aka ""Darth Maul"" has on screen, but the moments he is seen are memorable, if not divided. lol Still, yes, I did like it this time around, because I got some of the subtle or maybe not so subtle messages that perhaps we all should be getting. Yoda mentions to Obi, ""Fear leads to Anger, Anger leads to Hate, and Hate leads to Suffering"". This was in 1999 and truer words could not be more relevant for our time and people. The other message I really liked was when Natalie, the Jedis and all of her Nabooian court bow in reverence to the leader of the Gungans and therefore wins an ally and possible eternal friend. What a perfect message for any politician in this world to hear and see! That maybe surrender, peace and simple reverence are the best ways to get what YOU want done instead of war, etc. Yes, I do think that sometimes films, like Life, deserve a second look or chance and Mr. Lucas, I thank YOU eight years later and for 30 years ago starting it all and bringing it to us. Cheers!",1
2131,5.0,"I saw this movie first when I was a kid and I loved it and Jar Jar. I legit just thought Liam Neeson was Qui Gon, and he is a very cool jedi. Watching this film as an adult now though, I can see why such a highly anticipated film was hugely disappointing for a lot of the original fans. The franchise that people nostalgized and glorified as time went by played right back into some of the cheesier aspects of the originals (specifically ""A New Hope""), but the original fans were older with higher expectations and wanted something higher in artistic quality. No matter, one way of correcting the many wrongs of the franchise since would be to canonize Jar Jar as the ultimate sith lord, cuz why not? Maybe not, but there's no denying this film is still from a more worthy pre-Disney era of the galaxy from a long long time ago.",1
2132,7.0,"Out of these movies, this movie is the worst. The film contains content to a more G-rated sci-fi film. Holy, Chicken Little. This movie is not the best and it is the worst. I could match the disappointment of this film with Return of the Jedi. I wish this film was better off without Anakin as an 9-year old boy. The only part that was good during the film was the light saber duel. A 'Star Wars' fan like myself would be very appreciative to find out that this sequence is lightning fast. These duels reach above and beyond the stars. The duels are hostile and awesome to a certain extent. The prequel movies have the best duels and of course these duels are better than A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi. I wished the story and actors had a better role in the entire prequel trilogy. The disappointment of the prequels were that it had no story, plot or characters we could relate to. It seemed as if the special effects told the story. I was very dismayed with this movie, I hope that the T.V. series does better than this trilogy.",0

The true prequels to the Star Wars Trilogy are the two Ewoks movies and the Star Wars Holiday special.

In the back of my mind throughout the film was the knowledge of what is to come, but that didn't spoil the surprises. The special effect alone that have been packed into this movie make it a masterpiece. The story line, however, could have been developed a little more. I feel it was light-on and a little more background could have been given. The melding of computer technology with real-life actors was mostly smooth, but there were one or two sections where the artificial nature of the material was very evident. Overall, a great movie that leaves me salivating for the next two",1

I say lucky because by that time most of the Lucasfilm-generated hype had been replaced by public disappointment, negative reviews, and warnings to prepare myself for a cinematic abomination named Jar Jar.

There are a bunch of nice little action scenes, few of which appear to affect the long term plot.  It did not have the magic of the original series, but was always interesting to look at.  It appears that, Lucas had most of his ideas set for Episodes 2&3, and degenerated this script into a not too exciting, spiritualy deprived thrill ride.  I hope it works for some people.  Honestly, I thought episode one was the instalment that was supposed to throw the whole story into motion.  It doesn't really accomplish that goal.  This feels like it could've been an Episode 2,3,4,5,6, but not an opening.  Though I enjoyed this, I seriously doubt the film will be remembered as the others are.  But, maybe after 16 years, mister Lucas needs time to warm up.  Here's hoping for Episode 2!!",0

His entire race was much worse than the Ewoks.  I never want to see them again. Of course on the good side, AMAZING EFFECTS, and all the fighting scenes, especially the sword play.  There were many things set up which could play out well in the next movies.  It seems that this is really meant to be only one third of a story.  This was the character introduction and general setting up of things.  Nothing more, nothing less.  We shall see if the best is yet to come :)",1

There are so many things stacked against it. The plot is rubbish. Who cares about trade wars? The script is laughable. Where is the emotion in the actors voices? McGregor and Neeson are pathetic, whatever the papers may have you believe. Jar Jar didn't get a single laugh from the audience through the film, yet he's supposed to be funny?!? Err...slapstick comedy that you've seen done 50,000 times, and usually 50,000 times better too, isn't going to make us laugh.

Obi Wan was in Star Wars less than half the movie, but I know more about him than I do about any character in Phantom Menace. Han Solo is a character everyone wants to be, or at least meet. Luke is a gape jawed simple farm boy who is thrust into the big bad world unprepared. Leia is the leader of a movement she knows is more important than herself, or indeed any one person.",1
2152,10.0,"Well, the more I think about it, the more I like it. After the first showing I was confused and tired. Too much, too fast of new Star Wars events had took place, and the only thing I was able to say was 'Damn Jar Jar, but Obi-Wan rocks!'. Ewan McGregor/Obi-Wan Kenobi had and has for me become the coolest Jedi in the Galaxy. Darth Maul was like an unexperienced Pitt-Bull with over-confidence. Qwi-Gon Jinn was allright but too straight and monk-like. Jake Lloyd was bad, but I believed it was Anakin I had seen so it didn't really matter; maybe he talked too much while flying that Naboo Starfighter. Jar Jar was the pain he was almost-meant to be, he had good goof and bad, really bad goof time. Amidala was the straight emotionless character while her Padme was ah-so gorgeous. The story was great, the pod race not as exciting as I had been expecting but nonetheless extremely cool, the settings (Tatooine, Naboo, Coruscant and Otoh Gunga) were of the greatest things fantasy could bring on a screen. The lightsaber fights were great, and the final duel was awesome. People were complaining the lack of force driven conversation, but if you think about it here are the reasons (I guess): Jedi were in abundance at that time, people knew what the force was and what Jedi could do, so unlike with Luke in Episode IV, the Jedis don't have to explain everything they do. THE ART AND MUSIC I sorely miss Ralph Macquarie squarry design, I think Doug Chiang design are a little round for Star Wars, but since they are in the movie, I can't really say that anymore :) The music was great, Dual of the Fate, ranks second, in Star Wars theme after The Imperial March, it just creates a great dual atmosphere. But overall, it's the less-good (don't wanna say worst) Star Wars soundtrack, it missed a bit of thrill at some places and continuity.

Everyone walked out of that theatre totally forgetting what made the ""star wars"" series what it has become: a quirky cultural icon that appealed to generations on multi leveled platforms and continues to go strong. Even though many people just bought into the hype, talking to their friends in conversations that had that hinge of desperation in their voice, that they really felt _obligated_ wanting to like it so badly, so they did. ""George Lucas can do no wrong"" should be running through our pop culture like acid in our drinking water for a few years now, considering there are two more sequels on the way.. and I wouldnt be so afraid of these sequels if ""lucasfilm"" was more aware of the very large mistakes they made in the overall discomfort and blandness of TPM.. It seems they seem to be under the disillusion they made a film worthy of the labeling of both themselves and the general public of being ""loved"" or the like. When someone is overly critical of the smaller facts like that the character development was almost non existant, that what would have been good minor characters like Jar Jar Binks (I should not even have said that now everyone will think I'm one of _those_ bandwagon type jumpers) would have made great smaller appearances but were left to carry the weight of a main character, where other characters like- lets say Darth Maul, were left with only a few lines and some elaborately choreographed fight scenes...There was little conflict of interest in the film, there was little of much of anything interesting at all.

The whole movie had the distinct feel that it was an overblown motion picture based on a video game.

The special effects are simply that, very special, this is definitely one of the most visually appealing movies in the sci-fi genre.

Also, however, the acting, story, scene flow, and directing aren't near as well done as in the older films. There was hardly anything in the movie to keep me in my seat watching it. Most people hated the film, although it is impossible to rate this film without comparing it to the older films. Few people thought the film was okay, and even fewer loved it. The only people who did love this movie were small children and idiots who thought the androgynous Jar-Jar Binks character was clever, and die-hard Star Wars fans. Yet some big Star Wars fans hated it, because they didn't have to hypnotize themselves to convince their minds that this movie was actually good, and they actually liked it, because all Star Wars films are good, right?

2177,4.0,"i really enjoyed the phantom menace when i first saw it, way back in 1999. i was 12 years old, and of course at that time, star wars was my favorite film. however, there are differences between a film and a movie. this is just a big budget popcorn flick, and while george lucas has tried to make an attempt at telling the first three events of the star wars saga, it just doesn't work - on a technological scale and on a scale of substance. first off, the most obvious thing is that the film employs the usage of computerized special effects, which points out a horrible continuity gap between the new trilogy and the old one, even with minimal computerized effects added in those. as far as the acting is concerned, the only ones it seems to be natural for is liam neeson and ewan macgregor. i personally would not have had obi wan kenobi as a 'padawan learner' in this trilogy, but rather as a reckless jedi who is eager to train someone under his wing (think anakin in episode III). the writing just doesn't work, and the storyline is simply too damn long. and a trade war? what's that about? it is simply too complex at times. i also would have had anakin older, say between the ages of 16 and 18. the good thing about the original star wars movies was that they used adult actors to appeal to the kid in everyone. here, it isn't working; something is missing. one cannot help but feel cheated, as george lucas rereleased the original trilogy in 1997 not because it was the 20th anniversary of the original star wars, but because it was preparing for the release of the new movies. the new ones, as it seems, have simply tarnished my view on the originals, but you cannot blame george lucas at all. this is his story, and however he wants to tell it, he should just do it however he damn feels like it. but my suggestion is to get your hands on the original versions of the original trilogy, and eat those up. fast.",0

There are moments of brilliance throughout and Jake Lloyd (as Anakin) is not nearly as bad as everyone says he is.  Surprisingly, Lucas chose not to use a lot of foreshadowing on Lloyd's character.  I can see both sides of the coin in that Lucas couldn't just make an evil kid because then Kenobi wouldn't train him, but I do think there should have been at least a little foreshadowing to show that this kid may be destined for bad things.  Maybe in the next episode.  See it for the duel scene between Kenobi and Darth Maul if nothing else and do your best to ignore Jar Jar.",0

This film may have its flaws (Name one film that doesn't) but it has taken its place atop my ""All Time Greatest"" list.  My love for this grand film cannot really be expressed through words.

Even if Lucas made a film about taxes at least he could have focused on some character depth. What the hell was Jar Jar Binks?

Good vs bad, the same old story just with awesome special effects and in a three part story, which does make a difference.  I strongly encourage anyone who plans to see 'The Phantom Menace' and has yet to see the first three installments to see them and grow to understand why we are so hooked.

2200,,"Had ""The Phantom Menace"" not been in the Star Wars series, I might have been able to forgive its faults.  Its attachment to that excellent series of films, though, makes this film a real insult. Among the problems... Every SINGLE good thing in the film happens completely by accident.  The good guys have no plan.  They accidentally meet Jar-Jar...well, okay, that isn't a good thing, but we were supposed to THINK it was.  They accidentally meet up with Anakin.  Jar-Jar accidentally blows up the droids in the battle between Gungun and battle droid armies...might I add that having Jar-Jar do anything other than what is loosely called comic relief is a horrible idea. Heck, the big evil battleship of doom that of course wasn't just another copy of the Death Star, really...that was blown up in a MASSIVE series of accidents.  I guess we're supposed to believe that the Force had a sense of humor back before the Empire, huh? Let's also analyze some other significant problems.  The duel- Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan vs. Darth Maul.  Nice fight.  Too bad it didn't make a bit of sense. Qui-Gon Jinn is a full-fledged Jedi Knight.  Obi-Wan is an apprentice who is almost a full Jedi.  Darth Maul is an apprentice Sith.  It is extremely doubtful that an apprentice Sith with a dual-bladed SINGLE lightsaber can take a two-on-one fight with one full Jedi and another nearly full.  If the Sith are /that/ much better than the Jedi, then there's no way good ol' Luke could have ever beaten Vader- which he DID do, before the emperor interfered. Also, there's the matter of Qui-Gon's death.  I realize they pretty much had to have him eliminated from the story somehow, or Obi-Wan wouldn't have trained Anakin.  But being stabbed in an area that is not instantly fatal, with a weapon known to cauterize wounds (and that is made for slashing, not stabbing, and therefore would be awkward as a stabbing weapon), and slumping to the ground- somehow pulling Darth Maul's LASER sword, that cuts through much harder things than human flesh, down with him?  Anyone else see a problem?  Besides it being a far less visually stunning death than the rest of the fight seemed to be leading up to? Obi-Wan then proceeds, of course, to beat Darth Maul single-handedly, when the two Jedi couldn't even get a near-hit on the guy together.  Would it have been too hard to have Qui-Gon use the last of his strength to throw the lightsaber at Maul from behind or something cool like that, instead of having Obi-Wan get his power from anger (the dark side, by the way) and cut Maul in two with a slash twice as slow as the stuff the guy was blocking easily moments before? ""The Phantom Menace"" is watchable, but only that.  It is certainly not a worthy prequel to the Star Wars Trilogy.  I will see the next movie...but only in the hopes that Lucas will fix what went wrong in this one.  And maybe take out Jar-Jar...",1

It ended pretty well but the crystal ball was quite a stupid idea, and I didn't care for it very much.  The movie had a couple of surprises and still kept you on your toes.

The basic plot of this film is that the evil trade federation who are clear racial stereotypes are holding a planet hostage and they want them to sign a war treaty but the Jedi are like ""oh...oh no that's bad war is bad we need to save the queen before they make her sign it lets a go"" .So they arrive on the planet and meet jar jar binks,he's basically what it feels like to be repeatedly stabbed. Everyone has already said something about him so I'll try not to bring him up too much. Anyway they save the queen played by natile Portman she's so wooden in this she might as well be replaced by a robot and no one would probably ever notice. Anyway boring stuff happens they meet a kid called anikin he's funny but he's not supposed to be. Oh I can't explain the rest of it it's so bad. There's dumb plot points that make no sense like the fact that anikin is offered to become a Jedi and he's just like ok and his mother is totally ok with it. The sennet scenes are likely the cause of a lot of deaths the cgi is bad the villains are evil for the sake of it the Jedi are useless and do nothing but there totally ok with sending Liam neeson and ewen mcgreggor and there just like oh ok LETS BRING THE CHILD it's like so dumb.

2211,5.0,"When reviewing Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace, it is first important to note what it does well. The film establishes a decent Narrative, has brilliant special effects and has involving, if over exaggerated action sequences. Now onto the negatives-and there are a number. The script is awful, and George Lucas' dialogue is both laughable and ridiculous, although his direction is adequate enough. Some performances in the cast are soulless, Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker and Natalie Portman as Padme being especially poor. And then there's Jar Jar Binks; in fairness to Ahmed Best, he worked from a lazy script and lackluster humour, but his performance is the most irritating part of this film. The inclusion of his character in the prequels is one of Lucas' most terrible ideas, if not his worst. There are positives in the cast; Liam Neeson's Qui Gon Jin is fairly well acted, and Ewan Mccgregor does well as a young Obi Wan Kenobi. But these glimmers of hope are killed dead by the tedious pacing leading up to the climax. The character development is non-existent, and the plot is too straightforward and devoid of originality. Perhaps it seems that I'm being to strict on the film, but I have to give my honest opinion. There are elements of Episode One that I asked myself as to why they were included. When I compare Phantom Menace to Its counterpart, the original Star Wars, the gap in quality is enormous, and blatantly noticeable; where A New Hope feels original and fresh, Phantom Menace feels bland and unoriginal. As my summary says, the film isn't horrendous; there are positives, if few in number, and the prequels improve with every picture. But it cannot be denied that Episode One is a poorly acted and written film, which is tedious throughout.",0

Little children, especially, will enjoy it.  My favorite parts of the movie are the Pod Race and the fighting sequences.  The main characters in the movie are Anakin Skywalker, Qui-Gonn Juinn, and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  They meet lots of characters along the way.

Luckily the movie used cross-cuts to different action because when those guys were fighting, I didn't blink a wink because I didn't want to miss a thing.  I purposely forced myself to have low expectations of the movie because there is no way any movie could top the original in terms of nastalgia.  Having said that, this movie was done extremely well.

To give credit where it's due, the fourth episode, or original film, was quite entertaining, though it started to meander half way through. The other episodes, especially the first went downhill from there. Just think of the Batman/Lethal Weapon franchises; the first instalments were fantastic, but the others have been quite appalling. Back to Star Wars, and it seemed that for the recent film, George Lucas was carried away by the developments in SFX and CGI. Can anyone explain what Jar Jar Binks was actually for? He wasn't funny and did nothing for the narrative. What a waste of time, money and effort. Also, I think we've seen enough laser battles in our time to become quite annulled to more, so the climax to the film didn't satisfy. Probably the best thing about The Phantom Menace was Darth Mual, but we won't be seeing any more of him. Obviously the second film in the series will be a worldwide hit, swelling the coffers of George Lucas and studio executives, but is it deserved?

I felt like this movie was nothing more than a setup for episode 2 and from the looks of the movie theater, on a Friday night the first weekend it was out was only half full, the word has gotten out. Hype can only carry it so far. I felt cheated. Don't waste your money like I did.",0
2230,7.0,"The good news: It's a Star Wars movie which fits in nicely with all the previous adolescent action-adventures. The bad news: It's a Star Wars movie, so it's not much--and I'm a little disappointed that it's not very well distinguished from the other three. My personal critical hierarchy forms a diamond shape: At the top, The Empire Strikes Back, far below, Return of the Jedi, and in the middle, each superior to the other in different ways, are the two Lucas-directed episodes. I think Lucas is a master-shot master, but very little else about his directorial style has improved over the years. I would have expected more originality in the intervening years, and I couldn't help thinking that the entire enterprise could have been measurably improved if Lucas had the humility to ask Spielberg to switch roles with him and produce the film for him. There is no scene in Phantom Menace NO SCENE that could not have been improved by Spielberg's touch. But that which remains is only as disappointing as this stuff generally is. Don't listen to the anti-hype of critics who were part of the virtual hype (apparently the enthusiasm was a half-mile long and a half-inch deep--my showing last night wasn't even nearly sold out). Now the hype machine, having seen that it's after all just a Star Wars movie, wishes to distance itself from what they were complicit in creating. After all, it CAN be enjoyed on exactly the same level of entertainment as the others (except for Jedi, which had the Ewoks.)",0

2233,4.0,"I have never commented on the IMDb before but after seeing the rating of 8 this... thing... got I really have to put in my two cents.  First off, I'm stunned nobody has commented on the ridiculous notion that Anakin Skywalker -- later to become Darth Vader -- built C3P0.  You'd think when R2D2 and C3P0 crash on Tatooine at the beginning of the first ""Star Wars"" they'd remember they had been there before, or at least when Luke Skywalker buys them, C3P0 would recall beeing created by someone with the same last name!!! Worse -- let's talk drama: how can you feel any suspense for your heroes when they outnumber the bad guy?  The fight between Neeson, McGregor and Darth Maul is completely stacked in the Jedis favor.  First, Maul is just an apprentice; second, we've never seen him fight before so we have no idea how good or powerful he is; third, it's two against one!  Worse: Jar Jar. Does anyone understand a word this character says?  Does anyone even care?  And yes, he's a black stereotype, just as the bumbling Trade Federation duo are asian stereotypes and the fly-creature is an Arab.  Ugh.  Worse: our big hero, Anakin Skywalker, is nick-named ""Annie.""  Annie!  No wonder he turned evil.  And he's played by the worse child actor on the planet.  Not that the pros are any better.  Portman and Neeson must have had a contest on who could be more wooden, McDarmid is a weasel with none of the menace the Emperor should have, McGregor looks really lost and the Darth Maul guy could have been great if he was in the movie for more than 30 seconds.  Thinking back, I believe he only has three lines two of which are ""Yes, master."" What else?  Oh, we're trapped in Tatooine for two-thirds of the movie and tortured with an endless space-chariot race ripped out of ""Ben-Hur"" that has minimal bearing on the rest of the plot.  This movie could have been great, should have been great, and it woudn't have taken much.  It would have been terrific if it was directed by George Lucas of ""Star Wars"" and ""American Grafitti.""  Instead it was directed by the Lucas who created ""Howard The Duck"" and ""Radioland Murders"".",0

After reading how ""terrible"" this movie is I was sure I was in for a disappointment but man, was I in for a surprise.  As soon as the yellow text appeared on the starry- skied background, I knew I would love this film.  Not only are the special effects phenomenal; especially in the pod racing scene and the Gungan underwater village; but the plot was great.  It was what it was made to, set the stage.  I loved this movie and do not want to give too much away but I must say that I do not think justice has been served to the incredible Natalie Portman.  She is beautiful, intriguing, and a silence falls over the audience when the speaks.  I hope she is given more screen time in II and III and believe me, I will be first in line.",0
2236,7.0,"Like the first Star Wars movie, The Phantom Menace lacks involved character development, concentrating instead on whiz-bang, gosh-wow special effects. The plot itself is much more sophisticated than that of Star Wars, with mildly convoluted political maneuvering taking the place of the first movie's straightforward save-the-world, fairy-tale type story. While still pretty obvious, the overarching plot doesn't reach out and clobber you over the head like those of the first three Star Wars movies.",0
2237,5.0,"After watching the first one of star wars, interestingly, the most impressive part for me was the collaboration of the princess Padme amidala and gungans.

The collaboration in the phantom menace has brought me some thoughts in this context.",1
2238,6.0,"I expected it to not match to hype but I had no idea it would be this disappointing. For any other movie it would have been acceptable but this is Star Wars. First of all the thing was like watching a cartoon. The original Star Wars effects were much better, even with the primitive technology. Lucas has begun to rely too heavily on computers and digital magic and lost sight of the fact that maybe a guy in a costume would have been better. In the original trilogy when you saw a ship or a storm trooper it seemed somehow more real, not like this computer animated garbage that was thrown on the screen for the ""Phantom Menace."" But more importantly is the lack of any strong characters. Before you had a whole cast of interesting and full characters, now we are only left with computer enhanced cardboard cutouts. Before there was Han, the Princess, C3P0 ect. now we just have a Darth Vader look alike that has maybe 5 lines in the whole picture. Also gone is the clever and well thought out dialogue. In ""Episode I"" the closest they get to being clever is stealing lines from the original ""Star Wars."" And I won't even start with those amphibion people who were not only annoying but you couldn't understand a word they said. All in all it was simply eye candy, which may have been enough in any other film, but this is Star Wars.",0
2239,,"As TPM drew to a close, I keep thinking to myself dreams are only fantasies not able to be fulfilled. George Lucas has insulted our capacity to participate with the world that Star Wars has meant for long-time fans. The worst is that the 8-10 yr-old kids for whom the movie was made must have felt strange also. Aside from Jar Jar Binks and the cocky Jake Lloyd, the trade taxation and blockade plot is pointless to kids that are just beginning to learn their math and grammar.",0
2240,6.0,"I have to say that I'm very disappointed with The Phantom Menace. It has great music, great visual, but lack of story (it's so hollow almost like a kid's movie). The story is just too easy to predict and I'm so surprised that it's almost a exact ""clone"" of the first Star Wars with regard to the story ""pattern.""  Almost everyone could use a math formula to describe the whole story, that's not good.",1
2241,6.0,"I often find myself wondering if I have really gone to see the same movie as the other reviewers.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to even attempt to identify with their take.  I have seen Episode I twice now and I am fairly apathetic about it.  I don't have any intentions of seeing it again - in fact, I don't think I could sit through it.  Yet one of the reviews I read said that there was a full minute of applause when the movie ended.  I don't believe one clap came up in the theatre I was in .  Among me and my fellow viewers there seemed to be a general disinterest in the film.  However, I am not saying the movie was bad.  If it were unrelated to the Star Wars series, I am sure I would have loved it.  But this movie truly hurt the series. Lucas put in parts which twist the trilogy plot in ways which cannot be repaired.  Jar-Jar can be forgotten (which I am trying to do quickly) but we cannot forget the introduction of ""mitochloridons"" or whatever they were. This adds a useless scientific aspect to the force which merely muddies the plot.  We also cannot simply forget the fact that Anakin was made a to be a little too similar to Jesus (a saviour with no father...hmm).  These are continuing elements added to the storyline which will carry through the next two movies and even effect our view of the original 3.  Combined with the fact that many critical situations were resolved by slapstick accidents and that Jar-Jar was more annoying than C3P0 could ever aspire to be, this movie is mere filler compared to the first three.  If you remove the special effects, I think we would find very little left.",0
2242,8.0,"I was there, in 1977, just a boy of 10yrs.  I sat there in the darkened theatre countless times watching those images from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.  It's been 22 yrs., and I can still see that screen. I'm a lot older and I've seen ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" countless times as well. The other night, however, I was transported back into the body of that 10 year old boy as I sat in the same darkened theatre and let ""The Phantom Menace"" wash over me.  I bought popcorn for the first time in what seems like ages, and in another comment about the older and changed man I had become, on either side of me were my wife and my little brother.  I hadn't felt that right in a long time. That may sound a bit overwrought, and it may very well be, but being there with those who are important in my life now intermingling with the boy I had been before I knew either of them...  It was indescribable.  That, however, is the power that Mr. Lucas has.  He can bring us together; old, young, male, female, and switch us around with each other and with our own memories.  I thank him for that. The ""Star Wars"" saga is a simple story and ""Phantom"" doesn't change that.  Good and Evil are clearly defined, even if the personification of evil on the screen is chillingly more interesting.  This hasn't changed since the days of Darth Vader.  We may want him to lose, but we LOVE having him up there on the screen.  Darth Maul may not take up as much screen time as Vader did, but he makes the most of what he has.  Also, the sight of real, live(?) Jedis up there on the screen was a dream come true for all of us who grew up on Episodes 4-6.  We get a sense of why they do what they do and the sacrifice that being a Jedi entails.  It is 180 degrees from the quick, not to mention mostly unseen rites of passage that Luke went through. Liam Neeson, Qui Gon Jinn is serious and quiet teacher, with a large dose of rebel thrown in for good measure.  Ewan McGregor, as Obi-Wan Kenobi is dead-on.  He portrays the old man we know just as we liked to think of him as being before we got to know him.  He is a faithful apprentice with the courage to disagree with his master's more adventurous spirit.  Once his disagreement is answered, however, he is right by his master's side in every way. ""Phantom"" is not ""Citizen Kane"", but neither was ""Star Wars"".  This movie is exactly what it is supposed to and more.  Always remember that ""star Wars"" was made to be a stand-alone movie because no one believed it would succeed.  It did, and this will as well.  There are many questions left at the end, but that has always been part of the fun.  We know what will happen later and we now know what happened first.  I, for one, cannot wait to find out what happens in between.",1

As much as i like the original trilogy, this movie is definitely on a different level.  The screenplay, special effects, acting, cinematography- these are all better in Phantom Menace than any of the originals.  Furthermore, Lucas does a wonderful job of setting up what's to come in the future(i.e the rise of the empire and the downfall of Anakin). Every single scene in this movie has a definitive purpose, and only after a few viewings can a person decipher this.  The plot works so seamlessly it is amazing.",1

There have been a number of people who have criticized the lack of emotion in the movie, especially with the young Anakin Skywalker, and I can't understand why.  Jake Lloyd plays an incredibly convincing young boy who is full of innocence and eager to become a Jedi, and his unbridled enthusiasm makes this all believable.  People expect him to act they way an older, more mature person would act.  But you have to understand that he is a 6 year old boy, and children tend to display their emotions quite differently than adults.  As for the other actors, they all added an equally impressive emotional impact to the film.

There are only a few minor complaints like the messianic parts, and the robot soldiers (allegedly veteran or battle hardened warriors?) who have weapons, which its enemies can take and use against these same veteran soldier robots. Also would anybody please explain to me what in the Galaxy 'The Balance' is - Good has dominated for 1000 years ... must Evil dominate for 1000 years as well?? Nevertheless it is a VERY seeable film - super effects as can be expected (also the soldier robots), and a nice intorductionary plot to the entire series, presenting the Old Republic, its virtues and the political problems that will bring it down, just as it presents the problems within the Jedi Council. It manages to link extremely well to the main series, and is actually presenting some rather real problems and weaknesses in, and dangers, to most democracies (doubt very much that Lucas intends to do this - however, he does ..)! If you have heard anybody criticise SW-I for being superficial with no depth to the characters, don't believe it! What you must do is to go and watch this movie remembering that this is nothing more than the first part of a science fiction series aiming to do little more than entertain, i.e. that it is not a stand alone film with a major message, and that no film can truely live totally up to 22 years of media/cult hype! Moreover SW-I actually manages to both entertain and rather strictly remain within the bounds of the story, as outlined 22 years ago - no mean feat!

The critics may have put ""Phantom Menace"" down but there is some merit to what they have to say. The movie certainly was eye candy but I'm glad it didn't turn out to be like the Special Edition where the new scenes blatantly popped out at you and treated the viewer as if they had ADHD and said, ""Look at me! I'm a new effect and the reason for paying the price of admission."" Lucas was more discrete when selecting what would be exposed in the  trailers and previews. I don't believe the trailers spoil much in terms of plot and suspense. The movie could have used more character development with Darth Maul and a lot less screen time with Jar Jar who detracted from the overall experience. The voices used for some of the aliens sounded reminiscent of poorly executed voice-overs for Jackie Chan film and seemed completely out of place for an environment in a galaxy far, far way. This made me question why Lucas would do such a thing as use ridiculous voices for his creatures. I liked how Queen Amidala's voice was manipulated to sound lower in pitch which gave her more of an air of authority. And I liked how the movie had a deliberate end to it instead of cutting off in the middle of an action with the over-played ""...to be continued"" tagline. Episode One leaves you still hungry to see what will come in the latter two. I think the most challenging film will be Episode Three because it must act as a keystone between the series.

But put it up against almost any recent Hollywood movie and it can compete.  The problem is only that it can't compete against Star Wars.  But don't forget one thing.  Star Wars (Ep. IV) was produced without necessarily knowing whether sequels would follow.  As such, it is a complete story unto itself. Ep. I is simply a set-up.  Its true value will not be known until after all three have been released.  My only real substantive complaint is that the writing was fairly lame.  Hopefully Lucas will put quality over secrecy and allow some more people to see and edit the script.",0

The special effects of the movie are incredible, but the storyline was very weak. You never feel close to any of the main characters and there isn't the humor that the original trilogy had. Of course, as everyone is saying, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying, child-pandering character George Lucas has ever created... its as if he's trying to entertain toddlers who are fans of Barney or Teletubbies...

It was a cutsey, sappy, plotless homage to the power of a  a bunch of mindless, unimaginative teenagers weilding Silicon Graphics workstations. Put Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers, and the Little Mermaid in a blender and the Phantom Menace will pour out. Don't forget to spin it up well, all of the plot and character development should end up splattered on the wall. This movie was made to sell toys to seven year olds. I have to say that I rank the original three movies as some of the best that I have seen and the Phantom Menace (aptly named as a menace) was a major, major let down. I was prepared to be annoyed at the computer graphics, I was prepared for some cutsey nonsense, but this was worse, far, far, worse than I ever could have possibly imagined. George you've betrayed us all and gone to the dark side.",0
2291,,"From the goofy and rubber mouthed Jar Jar to the inane and hollow dialog, this movie stinks.  Everything in it feels tacked on from the previous 'Star Wars' movies.  Many of the creatures are CG animations and they all feel out of place.  The interaction between the real-life actors and the animated creatures looks fake.  It's incredibly embarrassing.  And just about every scene contains the hyper annoying Jar Jar Binks.  He really ruins every scene he's in.  It's ""Meesaa!""  this and ""Meesaa!"" that.  He trips over everything and makes the whole film unpleasant to watch.  And why does every alien have an earth-type accent?  It makes absolutely no sense at all. ",0
2292,,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  It is not as bad as many have said. Jar-Jar is not as annoying as the hype.  Darth Maul was not defeated too easily, a guy got killed doing it.  It was exciting with good special effects and plot.  I look forward to the next episodes.",1

I've been waiting for this movie ever since.  When the opening came, a tear almost came to my eye, I couldn't believe that after 16 years of waiting it was finally here.  And I loved it.  Everything about it gave me a feeling of awe.  The pod race is the most exciting 10 minutes of film ever seen, until the last half hour.  All at the same time, a ground war was being fought, and exciting space war was being fought, with Anakin Skywalker, and the best lightsaber duel to ever be seen between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul is fought.

And personally, as far as my liking the character goes, young ObiWon Kenobi beats Ep. 4's luke skywalker HANDS DOWN.

He thought it was pretty good and wanted to make a Motion Picture out of it.  But as he was writing the script, he noticed that it was WAY too long.  So he divided it into three segments that we now know as... The STAR WARS Trilogy !!! Now, we all realized that it started with the 4th Segment and continued all the way through the 6th and Final Segment.  Well, now the 1st Segment has been written and released and so many people have been trashing it !!! Why ?  It is just another Segment of a HUGE Story.  Why Put This Segment Down ?  People are saying ""It wasn't as good as the other 3"" or ""The Storyline sucked"" or EVEN ""George Lucas did not have the Force when he wrote this"". Well, all the dumb asses who said that crap are obviously not big fans, because if they were, they'd realize that the storyline was indeed RIGHT ON !  We finally get to see how it all began.

2299,8.0,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS.  Well, we all know the special effects are fantastic.  I mean I've never seen CGI blend so well with live action.  The sound effects were cool, as they were in the original trilogy.  Jar-Jar was a cool character design and not always annoying.  I think his voice was what bugged me the most.  If it had been lower and less babyish, I would have had almost no problem with him.  I thought the other Gungans were cool.  Darth Maul was an awesome villain, I only wish there was more of him.  Still, the final duel, and it's death scenes were really great.  As for those who say that the Trade Federation was a weak adversary for the good guys, I think you missed the point of the title--- THE PHANTOM MENACE!  This refers to Anakin's dark side tendencies, to the Sith Lord directing the viceroy's actions, and to Palpatine, who gains control of the Senate and will soon become the Emperor!  Those who say the plot is weak must not be paying attention.  There is more going on here than in any of the first three movies.  The real magic of the movie is the little details, though.  All the cool alien designs, the sounds of the pod racer engines, the more athletic lightsaber scenes, the accents of the aliens... these all made the worlds more believable.  Not the greatest work of art or anything, but a film worthy of the Star Wars name.  Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back are still better, but thank God there were no Ewoks.",1

Vader nearly lasted all of the original trilogy - now that is a real baddie, the secret is NOT to kill them off.  The characterisations are also no where near as strong as the originals, I found myself not really relating with any of them.  This has nothing to do with the acting, which on the whole is pretty good (and let's face it Mark Hamill was no De Niro).  Jaja Binks becomes the main focus of the comedy, making it much more slapstick and childish compared to the dry humour of Han Solo and the cheeky banter between the two droids.  All in all, this is a poor film and does not deserve to have the title of Star Wars.",0

2311,3.0,"But not much worse, as this movie is totally lacking in plot and good acting, with several minor exceptions (Liam Neeson for one).  What annoys me most is the reliance on special effects to hide the fact that there is no plot cohesion whatsoever, the characters simply talk for a while, have an action scene, then go somewhere else to talk and then have an action scene. Another feature that is most aggravating is the fact that the lead villain and my favorite character, Darth Maul, gets all of three one sentence lines and about five minutes of screen time.  Although I'm a fan of the original series and have read most of the books, I must say that this movie has the worst plot ever to be associated with the Star Wars franchise.",0

I probably need the money more than George Lucas does sadly. And the movie is terrible. And if you tell me that its amazing to see the pod race then you are a complete idiot.

Line after line, the script continued to describe the make believe world of Star Wars as if we actually cared about which planet was under Trade Federation control.

Fist of all, let me say this, as it is my strongest disagreement with the film- THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE BETTER IN THE FIRST THREE.  Everyone is saying how great the effects were in this movie, but, frankly, I think they all looked cartoony and obviously digital.  Lucs should have used models like he did in the first three.  He may be an innovator, and, yes, the special effects are no doubtedly a fantastic feat.  But just because brand new digital technology was used doesn't mean that it was more realistic than the effects in the other three movies.  Take a look at the Royal ship or the Naboo fighters, and then watch the TIE fighters and X-Wings in the other movies.  The ships in the new movie look to clean.  They are smooth ships without much surface detail, whereas the ships in the first three films look as if they actually were used and built out of real materials instead of being an injected molded fiberglass thing with a heavy coat of wax.  And some of those orignal models were less than two inches long!",1

The only reason I still own and enjoy this movie are it's redeeming moments- 1. Ian MacDiarmid as Senator Palpatine 2. Darth Maul (despite him being killed in the climax) 3.

The best comedy relief came from R2 and C3PO and it was so brief! (pardon the pun) I thought they didn't know each other? How could a mother let her boy go with a strange man so easily? You mothers out there, would you do that? OK that's enough complaining. The visual effects were incredible, the pod racer was stunning. The light saber fight was interesting (but growing tired).

The truly hard core fans may not like the movie and may call it a poor attempt at capturing the magic of the 4th, 5th, and 6th films, but try taking off the nostalgia colored glasses.

The light-saber fight scenes were good, but Jackie Chan is at least 20 times better at choreographing fight scenes.  I will never again watch this one, and probably will write off the next 2.  I am hoping that the third trilogy follows the Heir to the Empire books, even a bad director could make those books shine.  All in all, I must give it two thumbs down.

Some have claimed that its intensely political aspects (embargoes, blockades and trade treaties) were boring, but I liked how Lucas showed us more of the inner workings of the world he has created. It was also an interesting way to begin the evolution of the ""Star Wars"" mythology. I can't wait to see how the questions and problems set up in TPM will come together in II and III. (Hopefully, they will have better titles. Rumors I've heard: Episode II: ""The Rise of the Empire."" Episode III: ""The Fall of the Jedi."" I love those titles!)",1
2342,6.0,"It's apparent that the tone and focus of the new film is quite a bit different from the original trilogy.  Instead of high adventure and straightforward good-vs.-evil, we're seeing political machinations and the playing off of sides against one another (an ineffectual Jedi Council and Republic vs. an incompetent Trade Federation).  Anakin Skywalker is an intellectual with great tactical sense who will eventually turn to the dark side; hence, it only makes sense that the prequels should be a little more cerebral in nature, and focus more on thought than feeling (the reverse of the original trilogy).",1

It is very similar but we must remember that it is an entirely different movie. You people are too hard on it! Every actor played the scene well, Jar Jar was hilarious (his character is supposed to be annoying, there's room for character change in 2&3), I'm totally left hanging for the 2nd and 3rd episodes.The action scene were simply masterpice and the light saber duel......BEST FIGHT SCENE EVER! See this movie, don't listen to what the cookie-cutter critics and film noir/independent rejects are saying and just have F-U-N!! p.s. The Senator Palatine sub-plot is very interesting.",0

The things that ruined it are quite obvious to the general public and I can't see how George Lucas could've seriously added such crappy little kid characters to the saga.  Jar Jar is the most annoying character I have ever seen in a movie.  The stupid gungun or whatever it is, should have been like Chewy, just stand there and every once in a while get annoyed at C3P0...that's exactly why wookies are awesome.  Talking aliens, alright, but talking alien sidekicks that are overused in the movie-hell no.",0

Because it wasn't fun like it was when I've watched Episode 4, Episode 5 and Episode 6. He had to made a character such is Han Solo, we don't want Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yes, and also Ewan McGregor is awful, even he is one of my favorite actors, he was very bad in this movie. Only who was great was Natalie Portman. So, I suggest to Lucas, when he is going to do Episode 2, to think about McGregor and Jake Lloyd, because they could destroy STAR WARS.",1

The characters seem to talk only because it moves the plot along, character bonds are not strong, and every plot ""twist"" and ""turn"" is so predictable that just about nothing is left to surprise.  It is unfortunate that the prequel doesn't live up to its predecessors, but with all the hype what did you expect?",0

In Star Wars Episode One, director George Lucas has created an all new vision for an all new trilogy set long before the original Star Wars film, Episode Four.  Stunning visuals, a compelling plot, quirky and funny characters, and one of the coolest villians ever welcome audiences into a truly original film experience.  We will all be watching this film with great interest, eh Senator Palpatine.",1
2355,5.0,"Titanic, which is superior to Episode I, sustains its top position in the battle of the mainstream blockbuster films. As earlier commented by George Lucas himself and me, Episode I would do well in B.O. sales, but will never topple Titanic.  Episode I was a worthy opponent, but such a film with great effects, but a mediocre script, and a stupid annoying character like Jar-Jar Binks, hurt its chances at being number one.  Titanic had great special effects, but it also had a good script (I didn't say great, but it was engaging...forget if there were some fictional storylines or characters in Titanic. ..isn't that what film making or Hollywood is all about? The general story of Titanic was real history.  Besides Star Wars is fictional altogether, so there!!!!!)",0

I'm not a huge fan of the series, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first three, it's just that I wasn't planning on waiting 5 weeks for a ticket, ya know? What awaited me in the theatre was one of the most breathtaking films I had seen in years.  The special effects may look 'too' animated during the previews, but once you're in the theatre, it looks more realistic than the originals. Some of the dialogue was stupid, and that's about the only negative criticism I can think of.  I wonder if the dialogue and the voice were meant to be so ""corny""?  I found myself laughing at characters left and right, and I'm not sure if I was supposed to.  Never-the-less, Phantom Menace is a great film and I highly recommend it.",1

2360,6.0,"The Phantom Menace is absolutely, positively NOT a good movie by any rational standard.  I've been reading some of the user comments and I am astounded at the complete lack of thought behind them.  It seems to me that many people are defiantly praising this movie just because they think that they're supposed to.  If  you were to judge The Phantom Menace by the same standard used for any other movie (acting, story, plot, dialogue... heard of these?), you simply could not consider it any more than mediocre.  No movie is immune to criticism, Star Wars or not.  As someone who is old enough to remember seeing the original trilogy at the theater, I was very excited to see The Phantom Menace.  Hype had nothing to do with it.  I wanted to enjoy it.  I was ready to enjoy it.  Sadly, instead of the prequel to a classic science fiction series, I was subjected to two hours of The Galaxy's Goofiest Aliens.  Anybody who has the audacity to say that this disappointing mess is equal to, or better(!), than the original movies is profoundly deluded or just has terminally bad taste.  Make no mistake-THIS MOVIE WAS BAD!  Special effects cannot save it, nor can a bunch of so-called fans offering unfounded praise.  I Give it a little thought and you'll know what I say is true.",0
2361,5.0,"The Phantom Menace was sorry.  George Lucas has shown no growth as a filmmaker over the last twenty years but has increased his dependence on special effects to hide a lack of storytelling ability.  The Phantom Menace has poorly developed characters, no direction to its weak story and plenty of ethnic stereotypes.  One would think a veteran director in the 90s would be able to avoid such an ignorant crutch.  The movie gets off to a horrible start when we witness his supposedly japanese trade federation officers embarrass anyone in the theater with any racial sensitivity for about twenty minutes.  The Phantom Menace wasn't a letdown but it leaves a lot to be desired.  Nothing can be expected from Lucas who can't take his work in a different direction and seems to be satisfied by gaining money instead of respect.",0
2362,7.0,I saw this movie when it was first released two years ago and from what I remember I must say that this movie will be in my memory solely because it disappointed me so. Episode Numb has so many hang ups.,1
2363,7.0,"The Phantom Menace is a really good movie but the scripting is...ah...lacking. Lucas is still a good director, he hasn't lost his edge for action sequences but his writing could use some brushing up. His once reknown 'cardboard' characters which were interesting were now gone and discarded. One dimensional people are now no dimension. Good acting from everyone, esp. Portman and Neeson, but little Anakin has as much personality as a pet rock (sorry, kid, I tried hard to like ya!).",0
2364,9.0,"I personally enjoyed this film tremendously. There are few superlatives to describe the experience that have not been used used previously and I recommend this movie that enjoys adventure and fantasy in their storytelling because to me these things were fully realized on the screen for 2hours and 10 minutes. I do however believe that the pacing of the movie itself is faster than I would have wanted. What a short 130 it is indeed. I, for one, would not have mind staying in that galaxy for a little while longer. The frenetic pace that events unfold in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is so uncanny that it demands repeat viewings and exploratory conversations. In fact I have seen the movie three times and actually hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. I left with questions such as ""Is that it, but what about..... and why did this.....?""My interest is peaked for events that have already been played out in the first three movies.",1
2365,,"There's been so much hype for this movie that it's almost ridiculous. Everything from ordering advance tickets to hard-core fans camping out at box offices shows that this may be the most anticipated movie ever. However, as George Lucas himself said in an interview on May 9th, ""People should have a well-rounded life. I'm happy that Star Wars stimulates young people's imagination, but when you're in a situation like this where you have so much hype and expectations, a movie can't possibly live up to that."" He's absolutely right, the more hype you have going in, the more disappointed you'll be. After seeing the movie on May 19th at 7:30, I've never felt so good walking out of a movie theater. I must admit that I'm a huge SW fan, but the feeling of seeing a new chapter in the saga unfold on the big screen generates the same feeling that people had coming out of"" Star Wars: A New Hope"" in 1977. AS for the bad criticism bombarding this movie, who cares? Some of their gripes didn't come to mind while I watched the movie. First of all, Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker has been criticized almost everywhere, which seems a bit unfair. He's enthusiastic, not polished, and besides, that's pretty much what you'd expect from a nine-year-old-would-be Jedi, right? Also, Jar Jar Binks isn't as annoying as people say he is. At best, he's funny; at worst, he's nothing more than a scenery-chewer who is still tolerable. Finally, the idea of THE PHANTOM MENACE turning movie theaters into giant arcades is both unreasonable and unfair. I do think that Lucas over-does the effects sometimes (with so many ships and aliens on screen, you don't really have the time to appreciate everything), and even then, the effects are to help create the universe we're in, not to be thrown out there for small moments of awe. I loved all the action sequences, including the pod race, the ground battle between two completely computer-generated opponents, and especially the two-on-one lightsaber duel (my favorite part!). Personally though, I think the space battle involving Anakin was more amusing than thrilling (you'll have to see for yourself). Also, the music score was excellent, incorporating familar tunes with new twists, and also providing foreshadowing (listen carefully when Darth Sidious appears, and when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan speak about Anakin's future.) Overall, when you're standing outside the door to a new SW experience, just clear your mind of hype, criticism, and may the force be with you.",1

Sure, George, it's only a movie, but man, what a movie!",0
2369,7.0,"I do not see the problem with TPM, I thought it was an excellent addition to the Star Wars Series, being a Die-hard Star Wars fan myself, I loved this movie, enough to see it on several occasions, which, I must say I recommend, because the 2nd or 3rd time you pick up a lot of stuff you may have missed the first time. So therefore, TPM deserves a lot more respect and is a milestone in the movie business.",1
2370,,"I saw E1 last night. I think it is a well made, technically brilliant movie for children. But where has the magic, the big feelings and the esprit of the ""original"" SW-Films gone? You really think you are watching a very long demo-version of a new PC-Game. Finally I'd say the biggest differnce between E1 and E4-6 is, that the effects are playing the major role in E1, instead the great characters of E4-6. But I hope in Episode 3 (this shall be the darkest one) we will see a little bit more of a mature movie! For a normal movie I'd give it a 8 out of 10. For the long awaited Star Wars Episode 1 I give it a 6 out of 10.",1
2371,4.0,"If you've read many of the latest reviews of this movie, you get the idea that it is pretty horrid.  As one of the MANY long time SW fans, I do have to agree with the populous.  At first, I tried to like this movie, but after multiple viewings I just couldn't put it in the same class as the trilogy. Not even close.  On the first viewing, right after I heard the Trade Federation aliens speak, I suddenly thought that maybe I was seeing a SW spoof.  It was just so ridiculous.  Then reality set in and I was terrified by what I was seeing. Then when they met Jar Jar and he dived into the lake to show the Jedi the way to the underwater city, I was extremely embarrassed.  I could go on and on, but there is no point.  Good thing about the movie was the battle between the two Jedi and Darth Maul.  But the way Maul died was pretty disheartening.  He would just stand there in amazement and let Obi Wan slice him in two, yea right!",0

If it wasn't the way they thought it was going to be they didn't like it. I was happy to hear that Roger Ebert gave the film a good review.,1
2373,10.0,"This movie was spectacular.  The special effects were amazing.  Many of the critics I have read and heard about say this movie lacks character development.  This what all the critics whine about when they can't find anything wrong with the movie.  The final light saber duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul is one of the best fight scenes ever captured on the big screen.  This movie was sensational and it did live up to the hype, and as you know, there was a lot of hype to live up to.  If you didn't like this movie, get a life.",0
2374,7.0,"Although this was a reasonably good film, it was not nearly as good as it could have been. The first Star Wars film was very good, but they have been going downhill since. My biggest problem with episode I was Jar Jar. I couldn't concentrate on the film because all I could think of was ""Wow, is that guy ever annoying."" The acting was for the most part poor, but I doubt that the actors are to blame. It is difficult to act when so much is missing because it is to be created digitally later. The actors had to deal with missing sets, props, and even characters. The dialogue was often very choppy, apparently not from bad acting, but from bad editing. The best performance was by Ewan MacGregor. I had reservations about his part, since he doesn't look much like Alec Guinness, but he made up for it by making his voice sound like Guinness's. Although the digital sets were very effective, the characters looked a little too deliberate to be believable. This is, however, still new technology, and it might be a while before we see it work just right. I'm looking forward to Episode II, hopefully the makers will pay attention to complaints about Episode I.",0

Now let's be honest, you have be doing really bad to make Miss Portman look bad! Samuel L. Jackson looks lost, Jake Loydd was awful and later on Hayden Christensen's performance is nothing short of ridiculous Yet watch him in Life As a House. Or Shattered Glass. The man can certainly act. I love the Star Wars mythology and the Daisy Ridley movies are a wonder. This movie looks great and is worth suffering through till the Duel of the Fates with Darth Maul. Has anyone seen Red Tails?

2384,6.0,"This will go down as one of the most controversial films in history. You either loathe or completely embrace this latest saga in the Star Wars films. I fall somewhere in the middle of the two. Of course the first 3 movies are some of my favorite movies of all time, probably in the top ten. Expectations were way too high for Phantom Menace to begin with - but I have to fault Lucas for some major big league mistakes with this picture. First, Jar Jar Binks. This guy is irritating beyond all reason and sanity. I think Lucas was trying to imitate the successful Disney formula of an annoying jabbering sidekick. We could also do without the body fluid humor and what-not, it's just juvenile and has no place in a Star Wars film. A lot of the dialogue is forced and comes off flat. I know Jedis are supposed to be serious but come ON now. Ben Kenobi was never boring! Third, the plot was unimportant and not very involving. I guess it got the job done but the aliens didn't seem very menacing (the ones in Galaxy Quest were far more threatening!) and none of the characters made you care about them. Now - the plus side: the special effects have seen no equal since, and will not until Episode II. The podrace scene and the battle scenes are all expertly designed and executed. The music by John Williams is awesome as would be expected. And we have some good amounts of intrigue and suspense as a good setup for Episode II. I would advise you ask around before deciding to purchase this one, but you definitely can't go wrong with a rental. Just remember to mute the TV when Jar Jar comes on screen.",0

Yes, Boba Fett's on my keychain. But trust me, I wouldn't lie to you. I LOVE this movie. I've seen it a bunch of times in the theatre & a couple times on video & it still stands up. And, I'm not afraid to admit, I was a bit hesitant of the new movie. What if it doesn't live up to the first three. What if George embarasses himself with a subpar effort. But from 20th Century Fox's opening drumroll right through Boss Nass proclaiming ""Peace"", I was completely & wholeheartedly enthralled. What do I say to the naysayers? Maybe they forget that these movies are made for 12 year old's. Maybe they've lost their sense of wonder & can't go to a movie, sit back & suspend their disbelief anymore. Maybe they're jaded with adulthood. Who can say? All that I know is despite some negativity to the movie, a hell of a lot of people liked it. And I hate people who pick at it for dumb reasons. They think that it's a continuity error that in Episode IV Obi Wan said that when he met Anakin he was allready a great pilot. I don't see the problem here.

Lucas may not be the best director but fans ruined the prequels more than Lucas ever could. High expectations and whining when he tries to make them better. It's all worth it to see Yoda throw down. Anyone who says he ruined a classic (well, 3 classics) can do suckle on DC's NEW52 teat for a while. Drain that dry then come back to complaining about Saga. Anakin was supposed to be a whiny kid who lost everything b/c of his lust for power to stop what he ended up causing. Lucas created modern mythology and somehow it's not good enough. Go watch musicians act like actors and animated films and criticize cause that's all the haters are good for. Go Lucas. Bring them all back in 3D.

In light of my initial reaction upon its theatrical release, I decided to give this film a second chance, and can honestly say that it holds up no better on video. The look and feel of this film differs so radically from that of the others that one would almost suspect that it was made by a different person entirely.  Why should the technology in a galaxy far, far away have been more advanced in the past? Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn is a matter of taste, though Ewan McGregor does fine by Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The film sorely lacks a dynamic central character, and pint-size Anakin just doesn't cut it.  Natalie Portman, one of the distinguished talents of her generation --check out Lèon, this gal can act--is largely wasted in dual roles.  Her face is hidden behind hideous Geisha-like makeup, and voice is inexplicably deepened for her scenes as the Queen. I have often heard the complaint voiced that the original trilogy was a series of kid's movies, but Lucas is aiming squarely at the kiddie crowd in this one, playing up the cutesy antics of Jar-Jar Binks, serving to earn a PG rating in spite of the film's violence. Where once we may have rooted for the defeat of the Empire, we now find ourselves waiting for the Death Star to obliterate Jar-Jar's people. I will not say that The Phantom Menace is not without merit, as certain scenes and pieces of dialogue capture the flavor of the originals, but this could have been so much more.  We can only hope the next installments will live up to the hype",0

Yes it's true Lucas has used children's characters like the Ewoks, but nothing in any movie by any director I have ever seen is ANNOYING as having to listen to Jar Jar. He doesn't even make sense. You just pick out a few words from each sentence cause that's all that makes sense. It distracts from the whole movie. Ewoks were for the kiddies but they just squealed or whatever. Jar Jar is by far the worst character ever.",0

It's been 22 years since Star Wars was released, and much has changed in Hollywood since George Lucas unleashed Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, the Force and everything else upon an unsuspecting world. Visual effects and sound effects are bigger and generally better - mainly through Lucas's personal involvement in Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and THX - while characterisation and dialogue are (by and large) kept to the necessary minimum.

This movie was hindered and flushed out by the special effects and technology. The FX and technology overshadowed the movies storyline, and acting.  The worst addition to this movie is Jar Jar Binks, the digitally animated character.  He serves for poor comic relief in this ""should be"" on the more serious side movie.  The much hyped Darth Maul only had 4 speaking lines and a battle at the end of the movie.  He barely did anything. There was also no character development at all either. I just assume that we have to know all of these people.  Keep in mind we do, but when future generations see this movie, they will be watching Episode 1 before Episode 4.  It also seems like a small universe if you will, seeing many familiar faces throughout the movie.  Obviously, Star Wars is more angled toward marketing and children now more so than ever before, and I think it hurts the more older fans of the old trilogy.  I hate to imagine watching the 6 chapter Star Wars saga and starting out with this one.  This movie would have bombed if it didn't have the Star Wars label attached to it.  On the plus side of this movie, the battles were well done.  It never really re-captured for me the Star Wars feeling.",0

Well, sorry, but just as good charecters add greatly to the appeal of any story, particularly annoying charecters really do hurt it. I wouldn't have minded if Jar Jar had say only a brief five-minute scene, (which is what I hope happens in Episode II,)or if the other charecters had reacted to him in the same way the charecters in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK reacted to C-3PO, where they're constantly telling him to shut up (which is what I think most audience members would have liked to do,) then I wouldn't have minded to much. Hey, the latter would have made me laugh, which I belive was the intended purpose of the charecter. Anyway, this guy was so irritating, and he appeared consistantly throughout the film, chewing up scenary wherever he went. Lucas said he intended this to be a kids film. Well, the origonal trilogy wasn't. It was equally appealing for anyone from the age of 5 to the age of 80. To single out one age group and say they're the only ones the series needs to entertain is quite simply unfair for all the other fans. I can only pray that Episode II will be much better.",0

The latest installment, however, is a tired, over-produced video game that lacks energy, invention and thrills. The film is poorly paced and scripted and the actors so drained of any emotion they fit right in with the rather dull computer generated visuals. George Lucas has always been a clunky movie-maker, with none of the wit and energy of his buddy Steven Spielberg, but here he seems bankrupt of ideas. I always suspected that he was making this baloney up as he went along, but I think any one of the terminally adolescent fanatics who call this dopey stuff their religion could have cobbled together a better story.

I was one of those youngsters that saw the original Star Wars in the theatre and have waited a long time for this. While I expect to see lavish usage of computer generated special effects, I also am expecting two hours of absolutely wonderful entertainment.  George Lucas has hand rolled yet another captivating volume from the ""Star Wars"" tale with ""The Phantom Menace"".  I would hazard to guess that no one except Scrooge would be unhappy with this film.  Do not, under any circumstances expect to see anything approaching ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Citizen Kane"". Expect fun and a lot of eye candy and you will be more than satisfied. There are some glaring plot problems and general inconsistencies that kept my vote from attaining a lofty value of 9.  I would barely give this movie an 8 because I must round it up from a 7.5.  Why?  I don't want to spoil the movie but it is obvious to anyone over the age of ten that there are some real glaring plot conflicts between this episode and the original ""Star Wars : A New Hope"".  The character ""Jar Jar Binks"" should, in my humble opinion, be omitted entirely or replaced with a real human.  The computer generated Binks was still in the experimental stage and should have been left in the computer labs digital cutting room floor.  That aside, ""The Phantom Menace"" is simply the best family movie in the cinema for a very long time.  I would recommend that everyone gather up the children and go see a story from long ago and far far away ....",1

If you have a twelve year old...take him or her, they will love it. (If I had a blaster, I would have shot ja-ja binks after the first ten minutes). Unfortunately, that's the age and mentality who will be entertained by the movie.  Most adults will leave wondering why they just paid 8 bucks to watch ""Barney in Space"".

I am not, however, going to brainwash myself into thinking that Episode One matched up in any way to the other Star Wars films.  When the Special Edition Star Wars films were released with their computer enhancements, some were good (usually backgrounds), but some were bad (Jabba and Han's conversation).  When is Lucas going to realize that computers can only do so much.  A lot of the charm of the first 3 movies was the amazing puppetry.  At least they were something real and tangible rather than a computer generated mirage.  I mean, look at Chewy, for crying out loud! He's a big, furry costume.  If he were a character nowadays they wouldn't bother with the costume and make some ridiculous looking computer genrated...thing.  And the fact is, computers make things look too busy. That may sound kind of dumb, but just stay with me.  I don't care how close to real motion a lot of this computer stuff looks, it's STILL NOT THERE. All of the computer characters movements are too exagerated and deliberate. And no wonder the acting was a problem...they had computer generated main characters.  The entire movie they were talking to nothing in a computer generated nowhere.  I won't even get into Jar Jar and the idiotic accents of the Viceroys.  Basically, I can watch this movie, but there's many parts that make me cringe.  On it's own it's an OK movie.  Compared to the other Star Wars movies, it hasn't the heart.",0

The costumes (especially Queen Amidala's), technology, and locations are just beautiful! How can you give this movie a bad review?!

Its poor critical response is due I think to the fact that this is the first Star Wars film that assumes Star Wars knowledge by those watching it.

As a Star Wars fan, not a freak, there is a difference you know, you took the criticism with ease. Knowing for yourself that 30-year old people who had seen the original Star Wars movies when they were young would probably have far to high hopes for this movie, thinking it would be some kind of out-of-this world experience, you just knew that George Lucas wouldn't let you down. After seeing the movie, I know I was right. The use of special effects made thanks to computers was extensive, but did not at all ruin the movie; Lucas knew that he wanted to use what he could, and he did it. The result?

Those who glibly state that ""Menace"" is wonderful because the visuals are impressive and story doesn't matter seem to have forgotten why we all anxiously awaited this movie for so long, namely, to see how the STORY began.  Lucas was aware enough of this to include it in the film's marketing - ""Every saga has a beginning"", etc. - but neglected to include it in the film itself.  Who is Qui-Gon?  Where's he from?  We leave the theatre knowing nothing of consequence about him, or Obi-Wan, or any other character (with the possible exceptions of Shmi Skywalker and R2-D2).  Plot points from the other movies are simply referred to, without being elaborated or enriched in any way. We watch impressive things happen without any real understanding of the people that are doing them.  You rooted for Luke and Han because of who they were, not because they were buried in a sea of CGI images.

Many scenes were awe-inspiring, and breathtaking.  Plus, they were years ahead of anything ever done before.  I'm a sucker for visuals.  Give me great visuals & I'll like the film.  But they can't alone make me love it.  The story and characters have to be original and interesting, and that's where The Phantom Menace falls flat. Jar Jar Binks is a immensely annoying character, made merely for the kids to enjoy.  The characters aren't interesting at all.  I didn't really care for them, or what happened to them.  The story is weak too.  While the beginning and end of the movie are entertaining, the 30 minutes in between are incredibly boring.  It's 30 minutes of talking and talking and talking, saying basically the same thing over and over and over.  The acting isn't superb either.  Liam Nesson does the best job of all the actors, and his job is only a little on the good side. But the film, when there was action, performed it with class. That's what I enjoyed about it.  It was fun during those parts. Don't get me wrong: It was a GOOD film.  NOT GREAT.  NOT SPECIAL.  The expectations for The Phantom Menace were too high, and Lucas didn't deliver.

The whole point is that he was a good hearted noble kid and i think Lloyd managed to project that image. I did not like the inclusion of C3PO in this movie. I don't buy the fact that Anakin built him. I would have introduced later or not at all until EpisodeIV just like Han and Chewie. On the other hand, I liked the inclusion of  R2D2. If you watch EpisodeIV when the droids fall on Tatoine, you could tell R2D2 is familar with the place but 3P0 is not. I have heard that crap about the droids having their memories erased, but it sounds too corny for me. I loved the effects and everything and i think the film has the best Jedi Duel so far. I think all three of them did good. Ewan McGregor was really into it.",0
2458,8.0,"I think it might help figure out how serious you should take my review by stating my stance on the Star Wars franchise to begin with.  I am not a huge fan of the original trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, The Return of the Jedi)...I think they are great films in their own right, I just am not that interested in the whole franchise.  I also want to point out that I am basing my final grade of this film on it's own merits.  This means I based my grade on how good of an action/sci-fi/adventure film.....not holding it in the same ranks as other films, aka dramas, comedies, straight out action, adventure, or sci-fi films...you get my point.  Just wanted to make that clear as well.",1
2459,,"Overloaded with animation. I think George waited too long to make this, because to me it seemed that he forgot the formula he used on the first 3 episodes. The best part of the movie is the last 30 minutes where the action involves mostly people - not animated characters. I hope in episode 2 he gets rid of a lot of that crap & goes back to basics. George also forgot that the ""kids"" that were drawn to his Star Wars movies originally are now anywhere in the 30-50 year old range. They're the ones that wanted the most to see the continuing saga. And do me a favor George -- kill Jar Jar in the first 30 seconds of episode 2.",0
2460,7.0,It's a unique scenario. It's a prequel distanced from the source by two more intervening films and 25 years (real time). A hard journey for any small film to make. But with expert tuition and a handsome fan base before during and after conception it's proved to have weathered the storm admirably.,1

Star Wars 1 is the worst starwars movie so far. It has bad acting, even though there are great acters like ewan mcgreger,liam nesson and sammuel jackson. There terribal acting mainly coused by the really bad diolog that was writin by Gergio Lukes. The charecters are so so so badly writin your just waiting for all of them to die(in pain) There is.not one charcter where you can even build the smallest of connection.

It also tries to stand on its own which it does not do very well. The characters are well thought out though....Jar Jar is very annoying, Darth Maul is fearsome and mysterious etc. and the action scenes are top notch. But there is an overall feel that something is missing, probably due to the fact that we remember watching the originals a long time ago which are the meat and potatoes of the Star Wars story. Watch it as a good sc-fi movie and you will enjoy most of it.",1

2470,2.0,I am confused.  I am reading all these comments on how awful this movie was and how everybody was disappointed.  Then why does this terrible movie have a 7.1 rating?  Who out there gives this movie a 10???  If this was the first Star Wars movie to come out this series it would have bombed and this movie would probably have gotten a 4.0 rating.  If you don't like the movie don't give it a perfect score.  Twenty one percent of you out there thought this movie was a perfect 10???  Are you on crack?????  This is absolute lunacy. Why does Rocky IV get a 3.8 and this get a 7.1. Enough said.,0
2471,,"I remember when I first saw ""Star Wars: Episode One-The Phantom Menace"" almost 3 years ago.  It was on opening weekend, and I can still clearly remember all of the hype surrounding this movie.  It was incredible.  I mean, everywhere you went, you saw and heard Star Wars.  Whether you were eating Taco Bell, or drinking Pepsi, you were experiencing the hype of the most wildly anticipated movie since, perhaps, ""Gone With the Wind"".  It was on the cover of every major magazine in the world, and it was the topic of every news show around the globe.    The theater I saw the film in, was, of course, packed.  When the line ""A Long Time Ago in a Galaxy Far, Far Away"" appeared on the screen, I knew I was in for something special. Before I knew it, the film was over.  It ended almost as soon as it had begun, it seemed.  For a 2 hour and 10 minute film, it really went by quick.  I should probably get down to the point of the review and answer the most important questions:  Was it any good?  Is it better than the originals?  But, before I answer these questions, it should be clear to everyone that this is only the first part of the new trilogy. Two more films are coming, and truthfully, as a stand alone movie, ""The Phantom Menace"" does not really hold up that well.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, and it does an excellent job of introducing all of the characters that will no doubt play a more important part in Episode's 2 and 3.  It nicely sets everything in motion for the next 2 installments. ",1

2473,6.0,"There's the seeds for interesting ideas such as pod racing, a corrupted Jedi Council and Darth freakin' Maul, but the movie is weighed down by a dull story and awful writing. I never would imagine seeing poop or fart jokes in a Star Wars movie, but here we are. The only interesting character in the movie is Qui-Gon Jinn, but the problem is that he dies at the end. Obi-Wan isn't even a main character, he is always in the background with zero character development. This isn't really a Star War and more of a political skirmish. For the record, Star Wars has always been political, but it is mostly in the background with the story demonstrating it. None of the actors get to show emotion because of George Lucas' directing. The action is enjoyable, but is surrounded by a dull story. The camera movement is static with all the characters just standing around CGI set. The CGI characters look impressive, but aren't integrated into the scene well. All in all, interesting ideas within a dull movie.",0
2474,,"This is a comment for all you ""Star Wars"" fans who hated Episode I and II and don't feel if worthy of being called ""Star Wars"" First off, this new trilogy is vastly superior to the original trilogy.  The story lines in Episodes IV, V, and VI are so simplistic and childish compared to I,II, and III.  Finally the Star Wars universe has matured into a real movie instead of the Saturday Morning Cartoons that were the first three.  Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Star Wars Nerd (that's right with a capital ""N"") and should be embarrassed by the amount of knowledge that I know, but I am also a movie buff and I can tell the difference between a good movie and a great one.  Sure the acting is bad in I, and II but I guess none of you watched Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher closely.  Everyone complains about Jar-Jar Binks.  First off let's rule out the whole discriminatory towards Black people thing because both the designer and actor of the character were black.  I believe it was Comdian/Actor Whoopi Goldberg (Who can neither be funny nor act) who first complained about Jar-Jar, and I have no idea why anyone would listen to her.  Second, George Lucas does not make these movies to satisfy the Star Wars geeks.  THESE MOVIES ARE MADE FOR CHILDREN, and you all must realize that.  Third, I take it no one noticed the Ewokes in ROTJ.  Come on, little furry munchkins taking on an imperial army of seasoned fighters??  Bottom line is this, these movies are made by George Lucas.  Anything he does with the saga is his business and his buisness alone.  If you don't like it, don't watch it!",0
2475,,"A real stink-bomb of a movie. I don't want to call it a let down, that brings to mind images of Wookie freaks sleeping in front of the theatre for a week. No I wasn't even aware that Star Wars had such a following. It seems odd to me that people can nurse such an obsession for so long. But, hey, they were pretty good movies. They brought together age old myth, old style story-craft, and the latest in special effects.",1
2476,,"I tried to like this movie, I wanted to like this movie but try as I might I just couldn't...because basically it bored me to tears. For those of you who argue that years of fans expectations was what caused crushing disappointment I disagree....No it wasn't disappointed expectations that made me dislike this movie...it was just so boring...",0
2477,6.0,"It's a sad state of affairs when there's more excitement and thrills in a movie's trailer than the film itself, but unfortunately that was exactly how it was with the The Phantom Menace. The hype for the film was absolutely huge, this was the most anticipated film of all time bar none. The prequels promised to answer so much, like every Star Wars fan I remember watching the original trilogy and dreaming of what the mysterious 'Clone Wars' would be like and who Anakin Skywalker really was, what Obi Wan would be like as a younger man. Unfortunately George Lucas totally failed to create the magic that the first three films had in abundance. Instead of jumping straight into the Clone Wars with an adult Anakin we have to endure a peck kid who's acting is as wooden as an oak table - I don't want to see Darth Vader when he was a sprog he's annoying and not very cool! The story line is turgid and dull from the start, you know your in trouble when the opening crawl talks of tradedisputes. Perhaps dialogue has never been Lucas' strong point but boy does it show here, there's some great actors in this but they all come across stilted and uninterested, the charisma and charm of Han Solo is a distant memory. That's the major downfall of The Phantom Menace, where the original films seemed to have a purpose and zipped along at break neck speed with crackling chemistry this episode is more of a chore. It was so important Lucas got the story right for the opening episode but he makes major misjudgements, by concentrating the whole film on events that ultimately have little to do with the overall story he wastes valuable time, thus ultimately effecting the pacing and characterisation in parts 2 & 3.There are good elements to the movie, Darth Maul and the climatic lightsabre fight at the end for one, but overall it's a crushing disappointment. There will be those who argue its great but most fans cant help feeling 'It could have been so much better'.",0
2478,3.0,There are many reasons why this movie was such a disappointment. I'll name two (avoiding the obvious one: Jar-Jar Binks!!!): (1) the heavy reliance on CGI animation; (2) the inappropriate use of humor.,0
2479,7.0,"I never saw the original films, as i wasn't born then and so i never really grew up with star wars. I knew they existed but no more than that really. So when first watching this film as an 11 year old, i liked the fact that this was an exciting and watchable film. With hindsight, i can see that Jar Jar binks is extremely annoying and there is much dialogue that has been done before. It has brilliant action scenes, particularly the pod race and the battle at the end. Of course, the light sabre battles are well done and this contributes to the over all feel of a good star wars film. As a film i think it is very good, and is well worth watching. But, i can see why this doesn't appeal to hardcore fans as it does detract slightly from the original films. But i was excited watching it as an 11 year old and i would gladly watch it again.",1
2480,6.0,"Just my two cents about a film that has been variously ravaged in the years since its release. I just watched it again recently to refresh my impressions. The effects are top drawer, especially the pod race sequence, which is genuinely exciting. The acting is generally good from the more experienced actors like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin is very weak and shows yet again that it is always difficult to find a GOOD child actor. Natalie Portman is wooden in a thankless role that she does a little better with in the subsequent films. The Jar Jar Binks character is annoying, and could have been dispensed with entirely. And Yoda is less believable as a CG effect than he was as a puppet.",0
2481,3.0,This movie is so boring the caracters are boring or they are jar jar binks this is not star wars like we know it the only points it gets is that Darth maul and the Final battle are cool but for the most part it is Just boring,0
2482,,"After waiting 16 years since the release of Return Of The Jedi, I ventured to the local theatre for the 3:15am screening of The Phantom Menace.  As much as I want to tell everyone that this is the most incredible movie that I have ever seen - I can't.",1
2483,9.0,"Overall, this was a dazzling film. The special effects were great, the creatures were interesting, the costumes were insanely over-the-top, and the battles were fantastic. The story was good enough, and did indeed tie in to the other episodes. But that old Star Wars feel is gone. Instead of following the pattern set by the first three, George Lucas has made a movie incorporating every single trend in Hollywood right now. There's Jar Jar Binks, who I'm sure you've heard about by now, the unbelievably annoying ""Gungan"" who spouts phrases such as ""How rude!"" and ""I-sa wants to help-sa you-sa"" in an horrifyingly screechy Caribbean accent. He's obviously aimed at the little kids in the audience, but it was extremely rare to hear anyone laugh. Often, Jar Jar would be away for a scene or two, and the movie would become more engrossing, easier to take. But, without fail, after a few minutes, the floppy-eared, scaly, bug-eyed weirdo would show up on the screen again and rattle off a few jokes, then step in animal excrement or somesuch ""hilarious"" gag. Sigh. And the absence of a Han Solo-style character to put a damper on the heroics of the main few is unfortunate. Although it's easy to be taken in to the film, the spotty, inconsistent dialogue (""Are you an angel?"") often messes up otherwise dramatic moments. Also, the movie is devoid of suspense, thanks to those other three movies, whatever they were called. As for the romantic subplot between 10-year-old Jake Lloyd's character and nearly-18-year-old Natalie Portman's, the future parents of Luke and Leia, all I can say is... ehhhhh. And although containing some familiar characters, this one is SO different from the original trilogy, words fail me. It's just not the same. The scale is several thousand times larger, the story is heavier, despite all the ""comic"" relief, and the same tight focus, no more. And, well, that leads me to the most surprising point about this movie. Even with all of these flaws, it's great, and as far as visuals go, well, anything is possible now. It's engrossing, moving, and well-acted for the most part. I would definitely recommend that you see it again. It's another testament to George Lucas's genius that he could make such a great movie even with so many flaws. To put it on the level with the classic trilogy, many changes would have to be made, but it holds its own as a movie, and is far better than most fare these days. Thanks, Mr. Lucas, but for Episode 2 and 3, let's gorily kill off Jar Jar and try to focus, OK?",1
2484,2.0,"I'm a Star Wars fan, just so that we have that fact established. I have loved the Star Wars movies since the first time I saw them, and they're great. Except for ""The Phantom Menace"". This is a movie that hardly makes it as a part of the Star Wars saga. Lucas appears to have made this film in a hurry. There weren't many parts of this film which could not have been better.

The theatre was packed with similar 25-35 year olds desperate to recapture the magic of the first trilogy.  They were not disappointed despite the early criticism.  The components are all there.  The best feature is the special effects, not just their technical competency but also the breadth of the imagination displayed in new worlds, creatures and cultures.  The first half of the film burns slowly as we adapt to the new characters and try to work out the ultimate direction of the plot.  Far from the plot being poor the second half provides nice twists and a good turn of pace which led to several large cheers from an admittedly sympathetic audience.  Particularly breathtaking are the beautifully choreographed fight scenes(worth a second look I think). Go see this film, hang your disbelief outside and watch in sympathy.  You will enjoy.  The legend grows.",1

2490,5.0,"This movie must be the most-hyped event in my lifetime (episodes II and III will probably produce even more).  While it was enjoyable, it does not merit the hysteria and fanaticism surrounding it.  It was hardly spectacular. It's just a movie, and with the possible exception of the cast and crew, nobody's life is going to be any the different for it.  It does not even seem to contain a message of any sort, as one might expect.",0

I am completely in awe of George Lucas' imagination. This raises the bar so high in terms of creating fantasy worlds on the silver screen that I doubt we'll see other Filmmakers ever come close.",1

2495,4.0,"An average rating of 8? Are you kidding me? Phantom Menace has some of the worst dialogue ever..I don't understand how the actors kept straight faces saying some of the things they did.  Even with the prodigious acting talent of Neeson and McGregor, the lines still came off sounding completely ridiculous.  And the character of Jar Jar...just that alone ruined the movie for me.  I was even a little insulted by the stereotype the character seemed to portray. not only does Jar Jar stereotype black people, the viceroys were a nasty stereotype of asians, and Anakin's owner, the shop-keeper, was an offensive characterization of latin people.  George Lucas' style of directing and his falir for screenwriting is completely dated, and so is Star Wars.  I will say the special effects were amazing, which saves the movie from being a complete waste of money.",0

2498,10.0,"I have no objection to critics hating movies that I like, as long as they have good arguments. I have yet to hear a bad review that brings up any good points. They say ""there isn't any love story,"" Bull! Much like the first installment of the other trilogy, the first chapter just sets one up. Anakin and Queen Amidala's scenes together point it in the right direction. Second, all the critics say ""The plot is paper thin."" Yeah, so, the original ""Star Wars"" movies weren't exactly ""Citizen Kane."" Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but these critics ought to go back to the film schools they failed out of. I, like every other fan who LOVED this film, think that no matter what would have happened in this movie, the reviews would have been terrible. Reviewers, for the most part, just like to see big movies fail. Don't even get me started on the critics who are upset because Anakin didn't start to turn evil yet. (That kills the credibility of anyone who says it). Now I'll get off my soap box and actually give a few thoughts on the film. Lloyd, Nieson, and Portman were all good. Ewan Mcgregor stole the show, though. He really is a promising young actor. The effects, and trust me I usually hate computerized effects, are seemless. Finally, to keep this review brief, the little bit of foreshadowing at the end was magnificent. I can't wait until Episode II.   Also, I was glad to see Roger Ebert liked it. Cheers to him, and the handful of critics who resisted the temptation to pan this film.",1
2499,,Umm... no...,0
2500,6.0,"It was going to be almost impossible to film a prequel to the Star Wars trilogy that every one liked.  However, this is an admirable job.  The special effects are superb, but the characterisations a little underdone - like Return of the Jedi. The plot is fine, but slows down a little in the middle. The irritating 90's need to have silly jokes in the midst of serious action crops-up again, particularly the floppy-eared fellow who is badly overdone. Neeson is a little dispassionate, but the rest of the cast are good, especially McGregor who slots straight into the role of Obi-Wan. But the underlying theme is the continuation of the Star Wars universe. This was the most important thing and it sets up the scene for the next one nicely.  The next one will be spectacular.",0
2501,8.0,"Okay, I'm not a Star Wars dork...really, I'm not.  I just love the movies, they're classics.  So is ""The Phantom Menace"" able to live up to the previous ones?  This depends on the viewer rather than the movie itself. So far, I've seen it twice.  The first time, I thought it was okay, but not as good as any of the originals.  I went back a second time, though, and boy was I surprised.  Maybe it was because I entered with a different mindset...the first time, I let the hype get to me...the second time, I went to see it just because.  I was blown away.  The movie is amazing.  Not only do I think this lives up to the originals, but I have a feeling (maybe its the Force :-) that these prequels are going to dominate the originals. When I first saw it, I was disappointed that they didn't develop the characters...but the second time, you begin to notice the subtle nuances of each character, pick up on little tidbits of dialogue that you might of missed before, even the facial expressions work wonders to convey the sense of connectedness between the protagonists. You also notice, if you're familiar with the original movies, that the majority of the dialogue foreshadows things to come not only in ""The Phantom Menace"" itself but also in the whole saga.  The only instructions I give is this: don't let the hype get to you, go in there expecting nothing, go in with a clear mind, and see it more than once!!!! See it the first time just to see it, to witness the grandness of the effects and the kick-butt light saber duel.  But see it a second time and more for the details, the development of plot/character/and the overall saga storyline.  Just like the other Star Wars movies, ""The Phantom Menace"" gets much better with more viewings.  Even Jar Jar wears on ya  :-) Bottomline: This movie is GREAT!!!!  Two thumbs up, 10 out of 10 stars, a Must See again and again and again!  I can't wait to see it for a third time!",1
2502,6.0,"I was fortunate enough to have heard enough bad feedback before seeing this film (24 hours after release) that my expectations were not misled by the multi-million dollar yearlong hype. Fortunate enough to be prepared for the very PG production that had the comic relief gags and sidekicks that pad your typical Disney animated full-feature musical adventure. Don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this movie very much, however, my grins of being entertained were often interrupted by grimaces of pain (a fart-joke scene, R2-D2's introduction to the audience as a 'droid worthy of a commendation' and just about every single scene with 'Ja Ja' or whatever--the amphibious rastafarian sidekick whose screen-time triples that of Obi-Wan-Kenobi). There are few slow moments in this film--important to the twelve-year-olds who become restless during those boring snags called necessary plot development. Thankfully, most of the story has been revealed to us through the original trilogy, so Lucas was able to pull off barreling through this Episode I...never looking back. Although the computer animated characters and locations were probably the best I have ever seen...they still had that way about them that say ""this is computer animated."" I have been attempting to figure out why these are identifiable in any film that utilizes the technology and I think this film helped me out--the motions of computer animated characters are simply exaggerated. Almost as if too much work has been put into high-lighting their movements rather than allowing them to subtly blend in with the live-action players. Editing in this film also the commendation that R2-D2 received...very choppy at times almost as if it was shot in 45mm and re-formatted to fit your 35mm screen. Although it seems I have been overly critical of this film, I really truly enjoyed it...the pod race was an amazing achievement, the fights between our two Jedi heroes and Darth Maul (I want more Darth Maul--he's like Boba Fett, the most popular and least used character) make Luke and Darth Vader's fights seem like two kids hitting each other with sticks, and John Williams untraditional score hits a homerun. All this and I normally dislike movies that are generally directed toward General Audiences. One last thing: Even though everybody should go into this film almost entirely dismissing the trilogy...it is still difficult to not miss the rogue starship pilot and his Wookie.",0
2503,10.0,"I was fortunate enough to see Episdoe I on opening night and let me say I thought it was incredible.  I think this film is more than worthy to be a part of George Lucas' fantastic space opera saga.  I don't think he's lost a touch in his 22 year hiatus from sitting in the director's chair.  He still has the energy and enthusiasm of A New Hope and American Graffiti.  Now I know some people are giving it a bad rap for it's dialogue.  Let me pose this question, what the hell did you expect?  The Godfather?  Goodfellas? Citizen Kane?  Now let me get one thing straight.  I am a huge film buff. I love every genre and I like watching everything from Scorsese films to Orson Welles films to Kubrick films.  I love the art of cinema.  I also happen to love Star Wars.  I did not come to see Episode I expecting a script written with such creativity as say Paul Schrader would do.  I came to see a Star Wars film.  I came to see epic battles, fantastic worlds, interesting characters(yes I loved Jar Jar), and incredible thrills.  Episode I delivered with a bang, no wait, it delivered with a thunderous boom.  It was a hoot from start to finish.  I loved how Darth Vader is actually the person who builds C3P0.  I love Ewan MacGregor doing Obi-Wan flawlessly.  I loved finally being able to see the Jedi Council.  I loved that hard Jedi stare so perfectly done by Liam Neeson.  I loved the strength behind Natalie Portman(especially in the Galactic Senate scene).  I loved Jar Jar's silly humor(yes, I like slapstick humor).  I loved the cameo's by Jabba the Hutt and Warwick Davis(who played Wicket in ROTJ).  I loved the thrilling PodRace sequence which took my breath away.  I loved  John Williams' fresh, heart pounding score.  I loved seeing Darth Maul and Darth Sidious interact and do their dirty work.  I think I better stop or else I will go on and on.",1

Awesome special effects. Will win without a doubt the oscar, and costumes and sound.",1

They said it was too busy, Lucas had lost it, even kids would hate it, etc..I'll only comment briefly as I am sure this forum will be swamped if it's not already. Too busy? How can you be too busy with SW visuals? We've waited for this for 15 years I would have hoped it would be jam packed with new creatures, action, subtle references, and hitherto unseen technology. And it is. Lucas lost it? Well, sometimes the dialogue was awkward, and he does seem a little rusty but wasn't it a little akward in the original at times? It's always been a simple fairy tale story and this one is too. Yea, Jar Jar is annoying and so is that two headed guy at the pod race. But you can look over that if you try. Liam Neeson is very convincing as is Ray Park as Darth Maul. It could have survived with about three less poop jokes, too. But who's counting? It's Star Wars! And it's still the greatest show on earth no matter how much the media tried to ruin it for us.",1
2517,7.0,"Phantom Menace was... different. The special effects were, of course, amazing, as were the light saber battles and costuming, etc. I prefer a mix of puppetry and CGI (A la Jurrasic Park) for realism, but this was very well done. The acting was, for the most part, very good. The characters were memorable, though they didn't seem to have the chemistry of Luke, Leia, and Han. Jake Lloyd was great, especially considering his age, and Natalie Portman portrayed a dedicated leader very well. What stands out about this movie, in comparison to the original three, is the deepening and intricacy of the plot. The three original movies each had a very simple story: Blow up the Death star, save captured friends, etc. The plotting on the part of Darth Sidious and the political games in the senate made this  more of a thinking movie, especially given several other plot threads involving Anakin  and the Sith. That, though, may be one of the problems with the film. It gave a more adult plot, with themes that would be lost on most children (Anakin's virgin birth, the symbiotic relationship with the midichlorians), but reduced itself to more childish humor. An attempt to draw all audiences, I suppose, but I did find Jar Jar extremely annoying... Over all, this is a good movie, and a great beginning. Anakin, Amidala and Qui-Gonn were focused on in this movie, and hopefully we'll learn more of Obi-Wann in the second. This is an excellent first chapter, and I have a feeling it will only get better.",1

There's no story, it relies heavily on special effects to fill in the holes, the dialogue is hokey, Jar Jar sucks and it's a little flat - but so what.  It's a movie and it was enjoyable to watch. In fact, it was very entertaining.  Unlike the majority of Star Wars faithfuls I didn't love it or hate it, I honestly didn't feel that strongly about it.  It's a movie aimed at a younger generation and us old guys have to admit to ourselves that the reason we love Star Wars (and still do) is because we were in grammar school when it came out.  We either have to remember what it was like to be a kid again or go see more mature films. ",1

As the summary line states...it is.  After seeing the movie the first day that it was out, I can firmly say that the cridits who did not like it must have seen a different movie than I did. The Phantom Menance is a wonderful film in and of itself.  The acting and story is always interesting and, at the very least, very good.  The special effects are back on the screen as everyone expected.  In short, this film is perhaps one of the best in the series, if not one of the most enjoyable films I have seen this year.",1

What people all over the country are now realizing is that this movie isn't a mild disappointment- it's downright bad. Don't get me wrong- on every technical aspect, this movie wins- the special effects are dazzling, the set and costume design are beautiful, the mechanical designs stand out, and the musical score is excellent also. The problem is, this movie was made for  7-yr olds. This is Star Wars gone Disney. Scatalogical humour and slapstick abound, dialogue uses silly American slang and catch-phrases for comedic effect. Furthermore, the acting is wooden, and the emotional involvement of actors and audience was nil. The plot is serviceable, but the characters were extremely poorly developed. Natalie Portman did well for herself- about the lone exception. Darth Maul also, for such a terrific makeup job, had about 3 lines and was never developed as a villain. I won't go into specific problems, both because I don't want to give away spoilers on principle (not because this movie deserves our respect), and because it would take a very long time. What makes it really tragic is that the money was not an issue- we can't say 'oh, Lucas sold out to ____', because we know it's not true. Money was not a driving factor for Lucas in any aspect of this production. Nor even was there any studio interference. This is the movie as Lucas wanted to make it. We've been had.",0

Watch it without context or expectation and you will not be disappointed. Think Jurassic Park meets Epcot Centre, throw in Sean Connery in First Knight, and add a claymation Muppet. There's not much that can go wrong with that. The special effects are definitely groundbreaking in their scale, if not entirely in originality. (C'mon George, is this Episode I or a remake of Episode IV the way you wanted it?) The acting gets a bit stiff in parts, but these are alien cultures we're dealing with, and so could be expected. However, if you ever felt the need to explore the Arthurian mythology of the original Star Wars, or if you ever described ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as ""dark"", ""brooding"" or ""gothic"", ""Phantom Menace"" just might not be your cup of tea.",1

Visually, of course, it is stunning, but there are some very sophisticated themes that Lucas is introducing here. They will later become crucial to the whole Star Wars saga. For example, the lightsaber fight at the end of the movie -- besides being possibly the best fight of sci-fi history -- turns out to have fateful consequences unforseen by those involved. Also, I found the young Anakin's gift with machines to be a chilling counterpoint to his eventual robotic fate. Overall, despite the universally-loathed Jar Jar Binks, I gave this one an 8/10 -- and that would possibly go up as the new movies continue to add context.",1

I found myself thoroughly engrossed in George Lucas' vision of the early story. The un-PC accents didn't bother me at all. I'm a little tired of all the bad guys being Brits. I came away feeling that the majority of critics had gone in  with a chip on their shoulders and were searching for things to carp about. The plot was more than sufficient and the dialogue was fine. I thought the performances well done and the special effects absolutely incredible. I think some people expected Lucas to wrap up all the answers in one movie and that's not going to happen. I also think the fact that Lucas is independent and has insisted on doing things his own way probably alienates a sizable chunk of the movie community. I'm eagerly looking forward to a second viewing because I know I missed many things the first time around. Too bad for those who were ""greatly disappointed"" but I have heard nothing but raves from the people I've talked to and without exception, they are all planning to see it more than once.",1
2525,9.0,"George Lucas has created a believable galaxy of planets, cultures, and characters - at least the real human ones.  The computer generated races and characters are a bit difficult to believe though, and are obviously there somewhat to appeal to kids and sell toys.  The technology in the movie does somehow seem to be a generation behind the Star Wars trilogy, which is really amazing.  Not like going from the 90's to the 50's here when we know what that is like. Darth Maul was excellently played, though his appearance was childish. Too many horns and a lousy black and red face that could never appear naturally (colors had sharp edges, not a blending).  The light saber fights were full of energy, best yet! My only other story complaints involved Anakin Skywalker.  Who would let a little kid who had never shown any exceptional talent up to that time be a pod racer, in a big betting event.  Also how does the fighter he's in at the end have autopilot set to the battleship when the Naboos just broke into the hangar?  And who hires the engineers who design those ships that you can fly into them and blow up a critical component with a small weapon, thus destroying a giant ship.  George Lucas should have used that trick only once in Star Wars.  But we saw it again (very easy destruction of the Death Star) in Return of the Jedi, and here again in Episode 1. Also could the characters occasionally show fear in a battle.  I can see the Jedi remaining calm, but an untrained small boy who is not in touch with the Force?!",1

2535,8.0,"Star Wars Episode I The phantom Menace is a good installment into the Star Wars universe.  It is, in my opinion, about equal to Return of the Jedi, but not as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.  I think that this is a film that we will learn to appreciate a great deal more after we see Episodes II and III.  Right now we are viewing the film alone, which is really unfair.  This is really just a set up movie.  A set up movie obviously can not be as interesting as it's predecessors.  If you read a good book it's first chapters are not as interesting as the middle chapters. When I head about the prequel trilogy I was not expecting to be guessing what would happen next, after all, I knew how it would turn out.  How wrong I was.  I now find myself wondering how things will happen, even more so than I did with the original trilogy.  How will Anakin turn to the dark side?  How will Amidala die?  Why did Obi-Wan and Yoda disappear, but not Qui-Gon? Although the relationships were not developed in this film as much as they were in the others, I feel that this will be further developed in the future films.  I thought that the four main actors did a fantastic job. When I first heard that Ewan McGregor was going to play young Obi-Wan I'll admit, I had my doubts.  They were all put to rest when I saw and heard him on screen.  He sounded almost identical to Sir Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Natalie Portman played a double role extremely well.  She brought a very human touch to Padme, and a very regal feel to Queen Amidala.  Liam Neeson played a rebellious Jedi Master well.  And Jake Loyd, contrary to what early rumors said (""Mannequin Skywalker""),played a very good young Darth Vader. The actor appeared very innocent, which will make his turn to the dark side even more powerful.  There are a few hints at his future fate though, like his hard glares at Mace Windu in the Jedi Council. As for the much debated comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks, he is not a racist stereotype.  I firmly believe that Lucas had no bad intentions while creating the character.  If anyone sees the character as racist, they are going in with a pre-conceived racist view.  I think the character, whom many regard as annoying, had a potential for disaster.  However, he was handled very tactfully.  The action never centered around Jar Jar's comic actions.  A prime example of this is when Jar Jar is juggling the pit droids.  Instead of making a big deal of this Qui-Gon simply keeps walking and says ""Come on, we're going."" In all, I'd say that this is a very good installment into the Star Wars universe and worthy of the ""Star Wars"" name.  The action is great, and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The podrace and the jedi duel is amazing.  Although the lightsaber duel is not as emotional as the ones in the original trilogy, it is the best physical battle of all the Star Wars films.  John William's score is fantastic.  This is a very good film that does what a good film is supposed to do, keep you guessing.  You will find yourself, a few days later asking yourself, ""I wonder how Anakin will turn to the dark side?  Will his mother be killed?  Will Amidala leave him?  I can't wait for Episode II.""",1

Qui-Gon, Obi Wan, Jar-Jar, and Amidala don't have that edge, so PHANTOM MENANCE isn't as much fun. However, critics who claim that the plot of PHANTOM MENACE is the weak link are really off the mark. The political maneuvering of Senator Palpatine is fascinating, the illustration of the Galactic Senate awesome, and depiction of a society on the brink of an insidious fascist takeover, well, realistic. I admit that the more you know about the Star Wars galaxy, the better PHANTOM MENACE seems to be. So be it. George Lucas has delivered an essential (if flawed) addition to the Star Wars canon.",1

I have, however, since seen it again and without the anticipation factor, I was able to see the movie for what it was, an excellent opening act for a continued story.  Within the frame of the film, there was a plethora of brilliant images and beautiful symbolisms.  There is a lot more going on in the mind of George Lucas than dollar signs.  The power of the music is also unquestionable.  John Williams has created a score that not only underscores the emotions of the film, but it also stands as a very strong piece of music on it's own.

2559,,Okay people lets admit it to ourselves... this movie is terrible. This is a god-awful downright bad movie. If this movie wasn't directed by one of the greatest Directors ever and part of the greatest Sci-Fi movie series ever then it would have been laughed at and out of the box office in a week. I love Star Wars and george as much as any man but i slowly came to realize this movie was terrible.,0

While this isn't the best Star Wars movie, I still enjoyed it. I would watch this and Return of the Jedi over and over when I was small and even though this movie lacks in its acting and special effects, the story is much better then people give it credit for. I really appreciate the fact that the movie really goes deep into the politics of the order and really shows how the conflict between the Jedi and the republic starts. Plus...John Williams KILLED it.",0
2561,6.0,"The Phantom Menace is quite a mixed bag. There are some incredible visuals with the likes of Naboo and the Gungan city, as well as quite possibly the best lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars, but the plot lacks development and does not fit well with the purpose of the film. It was supposed to be all about Anakin's life and the beginning of his journey to becoming a Jedi and eventually a Sith, but he plays an insignificant role in the film, and his script is not very well written. Jake Lloyd actually did quite well with what he was given, but Anakin needed more importance in the film, and I think they should have made him older, maybe just younger than Luke was in A New Hope, so there would be less of a jump going into Episode II.",0
2562,,"First off, there was no way in hell this film could have lived up to the amount of hype surrounding it.  Even if it were on par with any of the original three, it wouldn't live up to expectations.  C'mon people, lighten up.  Like any movie, you have to appreciate the good and just accept the bad.  The moment reviews started popping up left and right in 1999, it almost seemed vogue to bash Episode 1.  In a way this overwrought negativity has made it easier for Attack of the Clones -the public was seemingly brought back down to earth by the problems with Phantom Menace.  Of course, at the same time it also puts pressure on AOTC to make up for many people's disappointment last time.",0

Lack of plot, lack of good acting, all except the lightsaber sequences, natalie portman and ewan mcgregor; horrible kiddy characters (i.e. jar jar binks) with useless roles, only for minor comic relief to audiences under the age of 7.  The only character worthy of screen time (Darth Maul) ends up getting sliced in half.  And in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" didn't Obi-Wan say he trained directly under Yoda?  Well apparently, mistaken was George Lucas.",0

2566,4.0,"I was SO SO SO Disappointed with this movie, I almost cried! To put it bluntly it was one of the worst films ive ever seen.  Script was terrible, no depth in any of the characters, Special effects looked way to computer generated, i.e. Yoda looked terrible, what happened to the models and puppets.  Jar Jar Binks: - I hoped they killed him off within 5 minutes of watching the film.  The only cool character was Darth Maul, but he was killed off too quickly and wasn't in the film enough.  The light sabres, ships etc make it look like it was set as a sequel rather than a prequel. C3PO and R2D2 just were not needed, and look back when watching the originals; you would never have thought Darth Vader was C3PO's creator. What a big mistake that was.  It spoilt the whole Star Wars franchise for me. I'm so glad the people behind the creation of the Star Trek Films don't make appalling cock-ups like this.",0
2567,,"Its 1983 and one of the most visually appealing Star Wars movies ever, has been released. The film is Return of the Jedi. We have some of the best set pieces ever committed to celluloid and we see the culmination of characters we have cared about since 1977. We finally see Anakin Skywalker return to the good side and the galactic war is at an endmany years pass then its announced that George Lucas, will create a whole new trilogy, chronicling the life of Anakin Skywalker and explain just why he turned to the 'dark side'. The release of the star wars trilogy: special edition only increases the expectation for Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and so it begins. The year is 1999 and the movie begins Does it start off with General Kenobi and Anakin facing off in the Clone Wars? Does George Lucas enthuse it with hard core mythologizing from the start? Do we find out how good Anakin was as a pilot from the very first frame? NopeGeorge Lucas goes back to basics. Return of the Jedi was the last film where we had an intergalactic war, but this film is essentially about a small planet being attacked by a Greedy trade federation. Doesn't sound too star warsy does it? Well not on the surface. To fully appreciate this movie you have to accept its not going to the rip roaring roller coaster ride that the originals were. By their very nature they were extremely exciting adventures with characters on the run . In this film, we have a peaceful galaxy as opposed to galaxy engulfed in a intergalactic war spanning hundreds of planets, instead its one planet. That of Naboo, which has came under attack from a Trade Federation.",1

I can certainly be objective about them now though, lets dig into the The Phantom Menace. ",1

2570,1.0,"After watching The Phantom Menace five times over opening weekend, I've come to a conclusion.  The bad reviews are unfounded.  Most of them center on how different TPM is from the classic trilogy.  That isn't bad, it just takes a few moments to readjust your thinking.  If you look at the plot of the movie, it is far more complex than any of the original movies.  Especially if you read the book, which really helps you understand the film.  The performances are a little above average; Liam Neeson does great, Jake Lloyd's okay, Portman's decent, Ewan's good... I especially liked Watto and Darth Maul, but Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine/Sidious) had the best performance. Overall a great film.",1

2573,4.0,"When The Phantom Menace came out it was probably the most hyped movie to that point in time, and rightfully so; the first Star Wars was great, The Empire Strikes Back was amazing and Return of The Jedi was good! However this movie did not live up to the hype at all. For years people loved this film and put it up there with the original trilogy, blinded by their own love of the first three. In time people realized that this film was not good at all from the boring plot about trade negotiations to the over the top tun of terrible CGI. Every thing that has to be said about this movie has already been said and I don't have anything new to add to the table but hopefully this review will cause its current score on IMDb to go down.",0
2574,7.0,"It has been six years since everybody was anxious to see the very first Star Wars movie in sixteen years. When it was finally there, there was a very mixed feeling among the die - hard fans. Some fans found the movie quite annoying, and didn't even considered it as a Fake - Star Wars movie. There was a lot of criticism about the character called Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar was a Gungan, saved by Jedi Master Qui - Gon Jinn. I've seen the movie so many times since 1999, and I can finally conclude that it is true that Jar Jar is irritating in a way. But according to me he isn't the most irritating character in the movie. Take a look at the little Jake Lloyd. Real Star Wars fans should be ashamed of this little boy, who just can't act, and is portraying one of the most disturbing characters in the entire saga: the (fallen) Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who turns into the dark lord of the sith Darth Vader. I just can't understand why Lucas cast Lloyd and not a true child star like Harvey Joel Osmont. The second most irritating character is the utterly useless Gungan-boss called Boss Nass. He is just so annoying, and poorly animated. So if you did not watch this movie yet, you must be living on mars, keep your eyes shut when Lloyd and Boss Noss make the appearance.",0
2575,6.0,"The re-installation of the Star Wars movie franchise; Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is almost terrible.

Enjoyed the pod race, the light saber fight, and the acting. Couldn't stand Jar Jar.  Please Mr. Lucas don't have him in Episode 2.  He is annoying and lessened the enjoyment of watching the film.

What it lacked, in unavoidable comparison to the first film, was the lively interplay between the characters.  There didn't seem to be much of an emotional link among any of them.

2584,,"The beginning of the movie is breathtaking, but when the big fish is eaten by the bigger one, and that one by the bigger one (and so on) it becomes clear that Lucas has no idea what is he talking about. The story is predictable and the characters don't change at all. There is no development, just an abundance of images. Little Lloyd looks like he exercised all his scenes in front of the mirror thinking: ""I'm good, I'm sure everybody likes me. I bet this one will bring a tear in someone's eyes."" I have seen more convincing performances by children of his age. A friend told me, she found a movie full of racism. All the good guys spoke with the english accent, and all the clumsy and ugly ones spoke with the accent close to the minorities. The Phantom Menace is like a great videogame. Who needs a story anyway? Still, it's worth seeing.",1
2585,5.0,"Yep, I'm a die hard fan. And I got up at 3 to see it at 6 before work on the opening day. And I was with other die hard fans. The only horrible part was how the people I went with decided that to be cool they would say that Episode 1 was 'awesome' before they watched it. Just because it's Star Wars doesn't mean it's great. I've never waited so long for a movie. But here's what I think. The score lacked. These movies go together as one right. All 6 of'em will be the Star Wars Sexillogy. (or whatever). So why not use the endeared Star Wars music. The imperial death march, the Luke Skywalker music. That music gives it that Star Wars feel. Instead, trying to be different, they covered it. Made the music 'sorta like' the original music which I found was just teasing me. When they start going into the familar music and then change it that makes me go ick. (I hate puff daddy too). Comic relief. Sorry, it is not Star Wars to goof around and be cute all the time. Even the Ewoks, however cute, came to the realization of a grim fight against evil and that deal. That sense of urgency and neccessity that kept you on the edge of your seat. Jar Jar is America's Funniest Home Videos with Bob Sagett, not George Lucas's masterpiece, Star Wars. C3PO's comic relief is much better. Makes us laugh because of the character's good development in interesting situitations, not because his pants fall down when reaching for his light saber. Action, it was great. Plot, it was ok. But this movie didn't incorporate them at all. It had a long plot sequence followed by a long action sequence. What was riveting about the previous movies was how in the heat of a duel precious information was given to increase the tension. As cool as the duel was it could have been so much better if Darth Maul was given lines to make him sinisterly evil. If we knew something of who he was. Scenes like Anakin going to the queen were boring. And they would string them together so you'd have one huge sequence of people talking to each other. Look to Empire. The battle of Hoth is one of the best action bits in history. And while it's going on we've got Lea and Han chit chatting. Great stuff. Lucas should have mixed and matched more with plot and action. Now, not to totally dump on the movie. It was good. But to be great and be Star Wars again Lucas has to stick with what made the first 3 great and Star Wars. Stop marketing to the 12 year olds and get credit for his amazing talents. Get back to emotions and finially make that Star Wars prequel I've been waiting for since Jedi. Again it was ok, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm still waiting.",1
2586,,"I found this movie to be one of the most entertaining that I have seen in a long time. What was done in to make this movie possible leaves me in awe! The computer work was fabulous.

The Jedi fight scenes were so well done that you have no option but to think that they are really fighting with",1

The pod race is outstanding (and very reminiscent of Ben Hur), the underwater city is great, the battle between the people of Jar Jar Binks and the Droids is immaculate, and the final show down between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the vicious Darth Maul is just outstanding.  All in all this movie is a worthy starting point to a great epic that makes me hungry for episodes II and III.  The critics just don't get it.",1
2588,,"I have to say that although I liked the movie, it was neither as good nor as bad as I had heard. I liked it for the most part, but if I could have taken a little eraser and canceled the character of Jar Jar Binks, I would have enjoyed it more.",1

If I were to rate this along side the previous three movies, I would have to say it only ranks above The Empire Strikes Back.",1
2590,8.0,"The Grand ambience and aura of this film and the majestic world that George Lucas brings to the screen is that of the world of Star Wars, and George Lucas lets us into his imagination as if we could see into his dreams and watch his world unfold onto the screen. The power of the galactic senate, the secrets and mysteries of the jedi and the darkness of the Sith. It's almost as if we believe this world exists. It's almost as if we could hope to become Jedi ourselves and travel to distant worlds to face the Sith and the darkside. There is more power in Episode I then there is the other Star Wars movies and George gives us the mystical dreamworld that will serve as the backdrop for the entire series. We can almost smell the evil in the crumbling senate. We can sense the fear in Anakin and we can also feel the mystery of the Jedi. In episodes 4-6 we are introduced to this world and the story seems more majestic than the world itself. That's where Episode I is different. The ambience of the film itself out does the script and characters and it leaves us some to be desired in the story itself. Which the reverse is true in 4-6. The hope that we have in Episode I is that a lot is left unresolved and it can only mean for a much better story in Episodes II-III, in which when the story will fit perfectly within its world. However, what Episode I did acheive, is a perfect lead-in story. It gives us the opportunity to ask questions and have a reason to see if they will be resolved. All the questions we have about the Sith and the Jedi and the republic will be answered and when that happens we will look back at Episode I and say ""Now I understand.""  Overall I liked the Phantom Menace and it accomplished the one mission that George Lucas wanted to achieve.. and that's to leave us thirsting for Episode II and III. I know that there are alot of questions I would like to see answered, and I'm sure that George Lucas will not disappoint.",1

I thought the whole ""Anakin is a messianic figure"" stuff was a load of donkey puss. Darth Maul was so damn cool. He was an evil cat ready to pounce on those wussy Jedi and open up a can of whoop ass. Unfortunately, he only had a few lines, and was not developed enough. I look forward to more of the Sith race showing up. They are sooooo damn cool. Again, kill Jar Jar.

Way too much use of computer-generated and 'cartoonish' characters this time - maybe to create a larger market for toy sales?

This is a serious expression of the story we've speculated and surmised all along.  And its delivery is in serious everyday conversational English.  The dialog is rather drab and straightforward.  The critics are having a field day because it's tepid and not profound! Believe me I wish it was the Gettysburg address for George Lucas, but it isn't.  Still, they need to lighten up, it was a most enjoyable 2 plus hours with inspirational cityscapes and graphics. The story goes along rather slowly and I missed the opportunities they had on Tatooine for the verbal jousting we had with Hans, Luke and Leia.  I think Mr. Lucas missed the boat on several character building moments that would of swept us into really caring for our heroines.  Natalie Portman is a joy, Jake Lloyd was just too unbelievable to possess his supposed skills at that age, but he plays a mean 9 year old well enough.  Ewan and Liam were all to serious and didn't get the range of acting their capable of.  The music wasn't intrusive and the effects were also mindful of the dialog, which I appreciate.  It's bad enough to scold an audience member, but to have the movie drown itself out is inexcusable. All is fair in Naboo and Tatooine for now.  I'll be there in 2001 to see how they proceed from here.  I give the experience a rousing 7 out of ten.  Go see this movie for yourself with the open mind of the youngster you were in 1977 and enjoy the renewal of the saga of good vs evil.",1
2604,,"It would be very easy to slam ""The Phantom Menace"" when comparing it to the other three films in the ""Star Wars"" saga as a whole. All too easy. The problem with that reasoning is, of course, you're comparing one film to a trilogy. Is the characterization lacking? In comparison, of course it is. Is the plot lacking? Again, in comparison, the answer would have to be yes. But here's the rub, This is one film. It is the prelude to two others; and ultimately, the setup for the very trilogy to which it is being unfairly compared to. ""Menace"" is a solid film, that, taken out of the context of the the Star Wars films, would stand very well on its own.",1

One thing that did take some getting used to was the overwhelming use of computer graphics in the movie (but we knew that was coming) and my one complaint would have to be Jar Jar's crazy accent - did anyone know what he was saying half the time?  Overall, Phantom Menace rocked and is sure to give way to a whole new generation of Star Wars followers.",1

2608,,"After watching this on video, I found the film even more disappointing than I did when I left the theater.  Sure, it's great to use SFX to show how much technology has improved, but aren't story and character development equally important to a film's ability to entertain? In the end, I just wasn't entertained as much as I'd hoped I'd be. Most of the computer-generated characters are grating, though Watto and Sebulba at least had some semblance of personality (yet still they're no Yoda.)  Jar-Jar and his fellow computer-generated residents of Naboo were even more disgraceful on video. That pod race was good, but no Ben-Hur chariot race (and not even as dramatic as the bicycle race in Breaking Away.) The final battle between the Gungans and the droids was just boring.  Would've enjoyed more scenes with the humans (Darth Maul, Palpatine, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, Mace Windu, Queen Amidala, and even Shmi Skywalker who should've been more interesting), though Jake Lloyd didn't quite make me envision Darth Vader, or even a future Jedi Knight.  It ain't great when all I can take from this film is the clever light-saber duel (can't recall any other great movie duels where the characters get to pause and then stalk each other while separated by an invisible barrier, but that added to the impact of the scene for me), the all-too quick appearance by ET in the Senate chamber (a cameo that I missed when I saw it in the theater), and the desire to have seen more development of the human characters than we got.  I enjoyed most of the first trilogy, but this one didn't quite measure up to those standards.",0

Han Solo, basically harrison ford and his humour was missed the most. There was an attempt at humour by Jar Jar Binks but the synthespian is no match for harrison ford.

2615,10.0,George Lucus does it again.  Expectations were high given the film making technology which has become available since the original 3 movies -  and I wasn't disappointed.  This is equally as good as the first 3.,0
2616,5.0,"This is Star Wars.  For me, this movie is just like the old Star Wars movies.  It follows the same formula that the old ones did, by this I mean that it unfolds in the same way as the others.  Yes, special effects are the main focus, but was that any different, say, in A New Hope.  That movie is about rescuing a damsel in distress...not very original or creative.  But the effects and characters take your mind off that just like in this new installment.  Darth Maul is absolutely wonderful and I just can't wait to see what Palpatine will do next.  The Phantom Menace is filled with the same fun spirit of campy adventurism that was so prominent in the earlier movies. This is just another Star Wars Movie, and like the others...it's spectacular!",1
2617,9.0,"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is a ground-breaking, must-see film.  Whether or not you are a Star Wars fan, you will miss out on a great film experience if don't see it on the big screen.  In case you have heard critics bashing it for lacking certain dramatic elements, or hard-core fans bashing it for lacking the ""magic"" of the originals, let's put it in perspective...",1
2618,8.0,"Well, I finally saw TPM. Before viewing the movie I had an advantage of reading people's positive and negative reviews which, on par, were evenly balanced from those who loved the move to those who despised TPM.

2620,8.0,The Phantom Menace continues the Star Wars tradition.  From the 20th Century Fox roll-off and the prolog floating in space Lucas has followed his format. Many of the mysteries are revealed but just as many new questions are presented.  My group consisted of Star Wars experts and some who have not seen any of the stories since the first time around.  Each of us enjoyed many of the ironies presented.,1
2621,,"I was entertained, but I found major flaws in this movie. I'm not going to complain about how cheesy this movie was, or point out technical flaws like ""Oh look, Han and Luke shot the stormtroopers to steal their armor, yet it remains undamaged when they put it on!"" And I accept the style of the star wars movies; jedis will always talk with backwards syntax and there will always be cute little characters and kid-humor to appeal to the toy buyers who aren't obsessive collectors. But I think this movie takes those aspects a little too far. Conversation has never been a strong point in the movies, but there was little character development, something which this movie needed. there wasn't much in the other movies, but I felt no connection to the characters in this movie like I did with Luke or that nut Han Solo. I have heard a lot of people say the acting was terrible, which was what I was thinking at first, but then I realized that the actors didn't really have much of a character to get into, other than an accent and/or a costume. the other aspect of the movie was the marketability. its always been prevalent in these movies, but this movie is taking it too far. i mean, it's already expected to sell 2 point some billion in tickets. i'm not just saying this because greed is un-jedi-like, but i think it affected the quality of the movie. i started seeing the fight scene between the droids and the whatevers as just a bunch of toys. and that jar jar binks was only as annoying as he was because kids eat up that urkel/ninja turtle crap. good special effects, good fight scenes, good action. somehow more high-tech than the ones that are chronologically later?",0
2622,9.0,"This is definitely a movie that you need to see more than once.  The first time I saw Phantom Menace, it was difficult to see past the hype, anticipation and my own preconceived notions.  By the end I was left feeling, well, a bit disoriented.  At first I rationalized and nitpicked, finding fault with everything from the acting to the special effects. However, none of my complaints -- just like those of all the reviewers I've read -- rang true with what my gut was telling me. I realized that I was missing something, so I went to see it again.  This time it clicked:  my prejudices fell away and I was simply awestruck.  It is a truly magnificent film: see it again for the first time.",1
2623,5.0,"Before I say anything else, the special effects are nothing short of spectacular. Besides them, however, the movie is sorely hurting in a number of areas. While I disagree with most critics' panning of Liam Neeson (I think his detachment is perfectly appropriate for a Jedi), George Lucan needs to hire a decent editor, Ewan McGregor is sadly underused, Jake Lloyd ranks about a 6 on the child-actor-annoyance scale, and I was ready to throttle Jar Jar Binks after about 2 minutes. Natalie Portman, however, was a very pleasant surprise, and Darth Maul kicked major heinie. The most, and by the time it was over with basically only, interesting thing about the movie was how it so blatantly set up the next two (I can't wait for Senator Palpatine to reveal himself as Darth Sidious and whack the whole Jedi Council). All that aside, it was great eye candy.",0
2624,7.0,"I found TPM to be quite satisfying considering the hype and the fact that it was written backwards (not entirely, but fleshed out after the movies that it proceeds).  In fact, I only had 2 major complaints about the movie. One was Jar Jar Binx, and that's just my personal opinion.  The other was the blatant attempt at making the war scenes less violent by using Droids. You can make any number of arguments about how that is a more intelligent and peaceful form of war (as if there was such a thing), but if that's the case, why did the empire use real people for storm troopers many years in the future?",1
2625,3.0,"Plotholes the size of antartica, dialogues not exceeding the height of your average sidewalk, and non human characters more horrific than Alien.",0
2626,3.0,"Okay, let's face it. Judging with any cinematographic criteria, this movie should never have been put on the screens. Frankly, I personally feel insulted by George Lucas.",0
2627,8.0,"Excellent movie - I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, and found TPM a high-energy escape that was well-crafted.   I agree with the disparaging comments re: Jar Jar Binks (a bit overdone), however the whole movie is excellent.",1
2628,10.0,"Ok, well, how do I respond to the critic's against the movie. Let us begin by stating what some said was a bad idea. Many thought and believe that Jar Jar Binks was annoying and just useless for the movie. Ok, well for one, he may be annoying, but so what, he is a character, he is an innovation in computer animation, and simply is funny. Many I know liked him. Jar Jar is a part of the movie and makes it work. Take him out of the movie and then most of the movie will be cut. Once you get to know him he is fine. After a few viewings you begin to understand him more.",0
2629,,".....of course you're going to be disappointed!  Everyone made this movie out to be more than it actually was.  They expected it to change cinema, movie-going, and their lives completely.  What these critics need to realize is.....THIS IS A MOVIE!!!  That's all.  Just a movie geared towards children with some adult tones.  In that respect, I give it a 9+ out of 10.  I'll start with the only two 'flaws' I saw in the movie.",0
2630,10.0,"I`ve seen TPM  2 weeks ago and it really was great ! It got everything which is known for all SW movies before ! Great special effects and amazing sound effects too. John Williams has done a great job again and Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and also Natalie Portman looked great ! Although I knew what  to expect I still was kinda surprised when the movie was over ! This movie really is the millenniums best SF movie and belongs on top of all other movies as well. Yes, I'am a big SW fan, that`s true but let me say that, if u won`t see the movie u you`ve really missed something ! Trust me !",1
2631,10.0,"It WAS fitting of the series. It is meant to be the introduction chapter of the whole series, so of course it had to drag a little for character building's sake. Other than that, I thought it had more than enough action, and Lucas topped himself with the added dimension of the final battle. For example, in RTOJ, there were three battles all going on at once, affecting each other's outcome. There were 4 in this one, and the battle was more creative at each of the sites. This is the first movie I've given since the mid 80's a 10 out of 10 rating.",1
2632,9.0,"Movie history was made June 18th when TPM (The Phantom Menace) opened in 4 theaters with Digital Projection, bringing us closer than ever to screening perfection! The show was teriffic, a must see for real fans!",1
2633,10.0,"First off, a very important guideline to follow when seeing ""The Phantom Menace"": you MUST go into this movie 1) Knowing it is the opening episode of six and 2) At least with an open mind. Preferably the mind of a child (you know - the mind you probably had when you saw Episodes IV-VI.) That said, this movie is incredible!! I must admit it was strange seeing new images following the Star Wars theme after 16 years, but I wasn't disappointed in the least. Cynical critics have blasted this movie for bad acting and old fashioned storytelling but come on! Have any of these movies had  Academy Award acting performances? No. That's not what you see a Star Wars  movie for. Two scenes are now forever burned into the memories of film goers everywhere (I hope!) The pod race, and the intense lightsaber duel between the Jedi and Darth Maul. Although the duel in Empire is more verbally emotional, nothing tops the sword play in this movie. The final battle between Obi-Wan and Maul is completely convincing. For all the complaining recently about movie violence, it's a shame a wonderful movie for all ages is ripped by critics and fans like this one has been. See this movie...several times just like the others. One last thing. I went into this film expecting to hate Jar Jar Binks. Instead I found him a welcome source of comic relief and a wonderfully believable character. Well done George Lucas! I'll be in line for Episodes II and III!",1
2634,10.0,I really don't know what's up with all this negative vibe about this movie. People don't appreciate a MASTERPIECE anymore.  This movie was the BEST movie I have ever seen!  I don't understand how anyone can say anything negative about this movie.,1
2635,5.0,I enjoyed sitting in the theatre and playing cards for an hour while waiting to see the movie almost as much as watching the movie itself.   Not a good sign.,1
2636,6.0,"For years, all people talked about was this movie, and what it was going to be.",1
2637,,"I just finished watching Episode I for the ninth time and I still am unable to take it all in.  Lucas is the master of putting dreams onto the screen. I only wish I had a fraction of his imagination.  Everyone already knows the pod race scene is flawlessly gorgeous, so I won't get into that. But the best scene in my mind is when they're escaping from Naboo and are saved by none other than R2D2. The first time through, the crowd ate it up. Everything about this movie is perfect.  Forget the negative comments and see this movie multiple times. Jar Jar Binks is also an achievement.  He was hilarious. Although during the final battle, it was a little much to have his own clumsiness save his Gungan a$$. Audiences were going in with the acting second string to the visuals, so don't expect any acting awards.  The actors did enough to get a feel for their characters, and that's all I needed.  Except for the cringing ""yippees"" from little Jake Lloyd, there are no complaints here. About the but....., there are no buts. A 9.9/10. I'll save the 10's for II and III.",1
2638,,"Well, I'll be honest, I almost fell asleep during the beginning of the movie, they where talking waaay to much, not a lot of action until the podracing scene. Man, I didn't recognize Natalie Portman from the start, this movie had amazing costumes. But the disappointment was Anakin, why Jake Lloyd? Why not Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense? What's wrong with you George? Haley was only 1 year older, and much cuter. Maybe you can star him as the next Luke Skywalker. I think the best performances was with Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman. Great movie but could've been more exciting than the first three movies.",1
2639,7.0,"No this movie isn't as good as the previous movies. But I really don't think that it was meant to be. It is supposed to show us how Anakin got to were he was. Compared to other summer movies Episode I had more heart, plot, and charecter development. The problem is that it has been in anticipation for so long no movie could live up to that much hype. Yes Jar Jar is annoying. But if this is the least of the series then George Lucas is still a step ahead of the competition.",0
2640,7.0,"This film is not as bad as people think. Yes it dosen't have as much characterization as the original trilogy, but at least it tries to give it's characters some depth, unlike other films like Godzilla. It's all supposed to be a setup for the next two films in which the characters really start to grow and change. The effects are great and the film is fast paced. Compared to other summer blockbusters it's practiclly a masterpiece.  *** out of ****",0
2641,,How did George Lucas come with this stuff??,0
2642,2.0,"Without a doubt, this is the worst Star Wars movie in the series and quite possibly one of the worst in its genre.  Take away the Lucas brandname, the star-studded cast and the overworked special effects, and you have an extremely poorly written, totally incoherent farce that carries an underlying theme of racism throughout.  The beauty and mystique of Star Wars has been wrecked by introducing half-baked concepts into the storyline, such as 'mediclorans' being the origin of the Force.  PLEASE!!! This is EXACTLY what the Highlander sequels did to the original movie.  As I watched the conclusion to the battle between Obi-Wan and Maul, I could not help but stare in utter disbelief.  The outcome is totally nonsensical and if you look closely you will notice a MAJOR editing error in the scene.  Shame on you, George Lucas!  Please quit while you are ahead and leave the series UNFINISHED!!!!",0
2643,,"I paid $10 on opening night at 1.00am to watch a piece of total garbage! Yes, that's right, garbage!!! I mean, the movie begins with characters we don't even know, letting jedis on their ship. But the discussions of both are hard to understand as the casual viewer such as myself ask ourselves what is happening.",0
2644,8.0,It's difficult to criticize The Phantom Menace without being biased by the fact that it is a Star Wars movie.  I definately walked into the theatre hoping for nothing less than the best movie of all time.  It was therefore unavoidable that I would be just a little dissapointed.,0
2645,5.0,"A bit disappointing.  Way too heavy on the computer generated action;  I felt like I was watching an animated feature, not a Star Wars movie. Overall, a good movie, but the Babylon-5 feel to it made it a bit out-of-place in the SW series.  Some of the lines are absolutely horrible. The last thing this movie needed was aliens running around ripping off old Mike Myers lines.  Excellent lightsaber duels and pod race scenes.  I'd rate it much higher if they had stayed away from the overly cute taglines (don't get me wrong -- I love some of the cheese from the originals) and the CG. Best line of the film:  Obi-wan's first line, ""I have a bad feeling about this.""",0
2646,10.0,Put all your pre-concieved notions aside before you see this film. More to the point dismiss everything the critics have been saying about this film.,0
2647,2.0,"I am a big fan of the first three Star Wars movies, and had hoped that the mystery and almost childlike grandeur of the others would be repeated in this chapter/movie.  But alas no.  This movie had the feel of an expensive, long, overblown advertisement for Star Wars toys and video games.  Even the feel of the characters wasn't there.  Most seemed to be just ""going through the motions"".  I could not make myself empathize with any of them.  To me, there are two sure signs that a movie is lousy: 1) you look at your watch every 15 minutes or so; and 2) you start to hope that the ""bad guys"" win. I did both.  The special effects were amazingly wonderful, but the movie itself was empty.  It wasn't even fun to watch.  Would I recommend it? NO! If you are a fan of Star Wars, stick with the first three movies.  They were MUCH BETTER!",0
2648,6.0,"This was an all action film, with a meduim amount of talk.  Since its the first of episodes, all fans star wars or not can enjoy this film.  Its also an all positive film, with only obstacles and there are hardly any down-uplifting rollercoaster emotions in the film.  Again, its all positvie. Though there were suspenceful-action scenes, such as the pod racing scene.",1
2649,8.0,"well, lets not get ahead of ourself. it's not that i didn't like it, it's just that after such a long time of waiting in great anticipation, for what is without a doubt the most curious movie in all time, it was kind of disappointment. to be honest it wasn't a total surprised for me, since LUCAS founded the ILM studios in the latest 70's he produced special effects and computer graphics effects for many movies, in this time he based himself and ILM as one of the top companies in the world for computer special effects, in this time he also forgot how to direct. all of the above is to explain the fact that also the movie is an outstanding performance of sight and sound it isn't really a movie. while LUCAS done an amazing job on the art design along with the great music of JHON WILLIAMS (as also) the movie lack the basic foundations that make the story interesting. the movie is great to watch as long as you concentrate on the   i n c r e d i b l e !! special effects and WILLIAMS outstanding music, the minute you try to sea beyond all that the movie crashes with a big bang. the main problem is with the script and story, they are far less then what we came custom of in the modern SF movies (like MATRIX, ALIEN1,2,3,4, ABYSS, T & T2 and so on), the script is full of holes and to complicate for SF movie of this kind. next time LUCAS should only produce and leave the story writing and directing for those who now how!!.",1

2652,1.0,"This is the most dull and overhyped film I`ve ever seen. What is wrong with Lucas? Can he even direct at all? No, I don`t think so. Nothing happens in this film, the actors are stiff like carrots and the FX are quite lame. And this Jar.Jar blink,sight! He interfers so much in this film that you hope he will be shot in million pieces by some poorley datamade enemy.",0
2653,2.0,"I recently went back and watched this. I had received the boxes set of the series as a gift this past Christmas. Anyway, the gist of it is that I decided to watch them in order. I could only make it through thirty minutes of Phantom Menace. It was that bad.",0
2654,,"I'm a big Star Wars fan.  That aside, I must say that the first time I saw Episode 1, I was disappointed.  But then something happened.  I had to see it again and again and again.  I recently got both the Widescreen and Pan and Scan editions on vhs and I must say that I now see this film as EXCELLENT!  I am not hesitant to give it nine stars out of ten!!!",1
2655,5.0,"The Phantom Menace has been so much attacked by the french media that it's sometimes little hard for me to defend it against its detractors... Well, I just would say that I liked the movie, not as much as The Empire Strikes Back, which is still my favorite. George Lucas did a great job with this good premise of the famous saga : special effects ( of course ), editing, music, costumes, design( the look of the Nubian Ship is perfect ), all of that is quite good. The story is maybe too complex sometimes, but I enjoyed the political subplot - one of my favorite scenes is Amidala's audience to the Senate. The casting is excellent, especially Natalie Portman and Pernilla August, who are in my opinion the main characters of this episode : they play right two strong and determinate women who have a important place in Anakin's heart. I simply loved them !",1
2656,3.0,"When George Lucas was making his Star Wars film in 1976, he had two objectives. 1. Tell a story 2. Make 775 million dollars. Nobody expected the second one to come true, but it did. Star Wars broke industry records and to this day is one of the highest grossing films of all time. When George Lucas was making his 4th Star Wars film in 1998, he had two objectives. 1. Make 924 million dollars. 2. Tell a story. Notice the difference?",0
2657,,"After viewing ""The Phantom Menace"" I find myself wondering what I liked about Star Wars in the first place.  I had to go back and view the first three films.  Now, after viewing Phantom in context with those movies, I can see what's missing:  emotional substance.  This film has no soul.  The original trilogy was like a modern day fairytale with grand adventure and high drama.  This film is very consistent in tone.  There is no suspense or unpredictability.  No guessing as to how the fairytale will turn out.  And the main problem with the story of episode one is that its a fairytale that has too much reality in it.",1
2658,,"I loved the movie, amazingly, despite the perpetual annoyance of that helium sucking computer generated aberration, Jar Jar Binks.  Exqueeze me?!  I would have thought Lucas below ripping off the Wayne's World movies.  And I'm sure part of my disgust at a Star Wars character saying that line comes from my dislike of the Wayne's World movie.  Star Wars is the single greatest achievement in the world of Science Fiction.  It brought that genre to the mainstream, and George Lucas deserves a great amount of kudos for doing so.  He did it without diminishing from the genre, which makes it all the more exceptional a feat.  But despite all his achievements, he doesn't deserve the apotheosis his fans have allowed him.  Soft, weak, inhumorous, garishly disappointing characters like the despicably abhorrent eye and ear sore Jar Jar are creations that keep Lucas from being anything but a mere, fallible mortal.",1
2659,1.0,"I was a true Star Wars fan.  I have shelves full of toys.  I own the original movies.  I was so disappointed by the Phantom Menace that I very well might not see Episode II.  I tried as hard as I could to walk in with no expectations, but even no expectations were too many.  The movie was terrible.  I can't go too deep into my disappointment without spoiling the movie, but I felt that there were so many things in the plot that could have been handled in a way that was better for the movie and for the story overall.",0
2660,10.0,"This movie was just great in all of it's special effects.  I love special effects and this movie completely layed down the law.  I hope Episode II is even better.  The characters were great and I didn't even mind Jar Jar as much.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon tore it up and so did the queen.  Darth Maul was in a class by himself, I still believe that was the only way Darth Maul could have been defeated, he was too good to be defeated in a straight up fight.  Anyways I can't wait for the next ones to come out!!! May the force be with Gearge Lucas in finishing the others.  P.S. George I wouldn't mind being in the next one =)",1
2661,1.0,"Episode I failed, not only to live up to the standards of the Star Wars series, but to live up to standards of basic cinematic mediocrity.  The movie was bad.  Period.  It has NOTHING to do with ""unrealistic expectations"" or the fact that it was ""only a prequel.""  The movie could so EASILY have been made better, by making some very simple decisions.  Like, ummm...""Let's not have EVERY HUMAN CHARACTER speak in the most monotonous voice they can muster.""  Lucas didn't have to spend an extra half hour ""developing"" the characters--he just had to give them SOME PERSONALITY--and that has nothing to do with not having the time to ""develop the characters."" It's not that we didn't know enough about them--it's that they were mind-numbingly BORING AND PASSIONLESS.  This could SO EASILY have been alleviated.  I don't want to know everyone's life histories--I just want them to be remotely interesting.  Don't tell me that visionary god George Lucas couldn't find a way, in 16 years, to do that simple thing.  Every aspiring screenplay writer and film director in America is giving a collective groan at the UTTER EASE with which Episode I could have been VASTLY GREATER.  I don't blame the actors at all--even Ewan McGregor wanted everybody to know, even before reviews came out, that George Lucas gave no freedom at all to the actors, and it was a directorial decision to make them speak the way they did.  I won't even start with the non-boring, but unspeakably repellant, Jar-Jar Binks.  And don't you dare tell me I didn't love the original trilogy.  THEY had personalities.",0
2662,,"This movie got a lot of bad comments mostly because it wasn't what people thought it would be.  I think everyone expected all three previous Star Wars movies all rolled into one.  I was a bit disappointed when I left the theater the first time, although I thought the movie was a lot of fun. I'm not a kid anymore so I have much higher expectations, and am not as easily overwhelmed with the warriors religion of the force.  That's my problem, and I shouldn't have expected to get the same rush I did when I watched the old Star Wars films.",0

2664,6.0,"George Lucas' Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace does not work. It is not a product of its times, and it fails as an attempt to recapture the concepts that made the original trilogy a product of its times. It is not simple, but is instead complex to the point of muddiness, and cannot be appreciated without an extensive knowledge of Star Wars trivia. It is an imitation, while the beauty of Star Wars lies in its uniqueness and novelty. The weakness of the characterization allows special effects and action to take center stage, thus shifting the film into the less timeless realm of sci-fi. While it has its own brand of ""feel of the old,"" this is a brand that denies the fresh, raw, and exciting elements of the frontier feel of the original trilogy. What is more, Episode I's ""feel of the old"" forces technology to the forefront, pressing backwards the crucial elements of man and magic. Even Couresant, which has the most potential for conveying a sense of mystery and for avoiding technology's alienation of men, fails to develop sufficiently to restore these elements of man and magic. Lucas' choice to create a more polished film does away with any remaining remnants of raw feeling, and the acting unfortunately assists in the relegation of men to second seat, behind technology. Only Liam Neeson turns in the performance that a film bearing the name of Star Wars truly deserves. All of these elements thus force the visual elements of the film-special effects and costuming-to the forefront, denying the actual substance that should support the work. Episode I is a big show of inappropriate glitz and glamor-just what Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and The Return of the Jedi avoided being-without much to back it up, and without innovation. It thus falls into the trap of becoming just what the original trilogy was noteworthy for breaking from: a sci-fi flick. Finally, the beauty of the original trilogy as a unit suspended between unmade trilogies makes the completion of Episode I sacrilege.",1
2665,5.0,"This movie it's for everyone who like to go to the circus!!! Get it? I think that when the Episode II come out, it will explain a lot the whole fantastic George Lucas's story, because it's the beginning of a complex story. All that confusion with whose father is, who is the father of Luke... all the explanation starts here, in this confused movie. But it has it explication of it confusion: The mysterious looking of the young kid to the princess; the demoniac expression of the kid; the exaggeration centered on the kid(he is so strong, his Force is terrific, he is The Chosen, he is everything...). This is to show us his power that he will use... My final opinion is: we can't watch only this movie unknowing the rest of the story, otherwise we'll think, like I said at first place, that this movie is a silliness! This is an Explanation!!",1

When I heard about George Lucas started plans for Episode 1 back in 1995, I was exited about it. In 1998 i've seen the trailers and red articles and i really wasn't expecting the greatest movie ever, but i was expecting unique eye candy, great action scenes, cool characters and also a little more depth into the Jedi mythology.",1
2667,6.0,George Lucas must have too many butt-kissers in his camp these days. Either that or just delusional followers who blindly take all of his ideas as gems. That is the only explanation I can think of for how and why Jar Jar Binks was allowed to permeate this movie. I loved Star Wars when I was 7 and I didn't need some cheesy muppitt to convince me. I thought a lesson had been learned with the ending of Return of the Jedi.  But mistakes are frequently repeated I suppose; it's just a little surprising at this level.  You do not need infantile characters to appeal to a young audience! I and many others are living proof.,1
2668,,Is it any coincidence that Alec Guinness died within one year of this film being released? The film is based on cheesy CGI images that are cartoonish and empty.,1
2669,,"I can't quite get what it is that people see in this movie.  No matter where I go, there's always someone there who's in love with it.  But for the special effects and Liam Neeson (the only one who was worth his shirt acting), the movie was worthless.  All it is is a stage setting for the next two episodes, and from the looks of Episode II, neither of them will be much good either.  Lucas should've stuck with Indiana Jones.  All four Star Wars movies have been overrated as quality film, when Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were the only decent ones.",0
2670,,"The Star Wars movies have always been some of my favorites.  I find them very exciting, and the plot just seems to take me away, and makes me feel like I'm almost a character in the movie.  Episode I, on the otherhand, could just not keep my attention.  I actually (I swear to you I'm not making this up, lol) fell ASLEEP and missed the last half hour, so I had to pay another five bucks to see the whole thing again the last week, and found it even more boring then.  This is only the second time in my life that I've fallen asleep at a movie theatre.  The other time was when I was three, during some Disney movie.  Some people are saying ""this was just meant to introduce the characters..yadda yadda yadda"".  You don't spent two hours just introducing characters!  I wouldn't say this movie was the worst of all time, considering that a lot of people seem to really like it (though I don't know how).  I really hope Episode II is better.",0

The plot makes no sense, the characters are undeveloped, the acting is uninspired to say the least (and with such great actors giving ALL terrible performances you know the problem are not the actors themselves but the director), the special effects are laughable and very dated by today's standards (not that they were any good back in '99), and overall this is a poorly conceived and badly executed....project, I guess. This thing is not even worthy of being called a ""movie"" because a movie is supposed to have a story and some characters: this failed experiment has neither.",0

2675,,"when i saw this film in the theater, i thought it was great, so great in fact, that i saw it two more times. why?  because i was starved for fresh star wars material, and when you are starving, chitlins taste as good as a moist, delicious honey baked ham.  when i watched it later, parts of it were quite good, but the parts with jake loyd in them were simply horrible. hell, i didn't even mind jar jar that much, he was stupid and annoying, but he was comic relief and not to be taken seriously.  the lines that lucas gave to jake loyd were god awful, and the delivery was even worse.  when you are writing a movie that is supposed to tell an epic story, it seems like you wouldnt want to have your characters spouting one liners, let alone by the kid from freakin' jungle all the way.  lucas wrote the part of anakin way too young, and way too stupid.  an older actor, perhaps one that could act, would have been much better, and any future romance between anakin and padme would have been much more believable.  it is not hard to imagine with only slight changes in casting and scripting, this could have been a vastly superior film.",0
2676,,"The special effects in this film are absolutely fantastic.  The lightsbre battles (particularly in the finale) are very well choreographed, and the pod race really does give an impression of very high speed, which is impressive. However, this film can't decide who it's target audience.  In Britain this film was given a Universal rating.  That means that a three year old could have gone and watched:",0
2677,,"Since he waited almost 20 years to pick up this series, I'm honestly not sure how I would have wanted Lucas to handle this, but there's a couple problems right off the bat as far as I'm concerned - I was seven when I saw the first Star Wars film and like many others I was obsessed with it as a child, but now I'm not a kid anymore so do I want the series to pick up the way it was when I was a child, or do I want it to appeal to me now as an adult?  I think it tried to be both, and ended up being neither.  No one could fault the visuals - it looked better than any film I've seen as far as that goes, but unfortunately no matter how eye-poppingly stunning the visuals are, that just ain't very far.  The story was not bad - it wasn't the adventure that the first one was, and of course this predates all of the characters we've come to know and love to that element is gone as well...I hate to say it, but the only word that comes to mind to express my dissatisfaction was that it was just so...forgettable.  I don't recall the name of Liam Neison's character, and I just didn't care when he was killed by the equally forgettable Darth Maul (next to Darth Vader, what a yawn this guy was)...the kid who played young Anakin was equally dull and forgettable, and I didn't buy for a second the kid was bright or talented enough to fly a pod much less build C3PO (as I think I was supposed to believe)...the Princess was just kind of there, unlike the attention-grabbing Princess Leia of the first three films.  I'm actually forced to admit that the most memorable character in the film was Jar Jar, and not because he was such a feat of movie-making technology but because he was the most annoying movie character I've been forced to endure in recent memory - he's memorable for all the wrong reasons.  He makes a great doll, though, so I imagine we can expect to see more of him in the next film.  I don't know...with the exception of the kid who played Anakin the actors were all top notch, I can't fault them, but something was just missing...perhaps the seven year old within me is just gone, but I felt like this film was one big study in special effects, and applied an overblown seriousness to what was once a fun adventure - a seriousness which I think was meant to appeal to the adult in me.  Well, Jar Jar didn't appeal to the kid in me, I wanted to choke him, and the self-important seriousness didn't appeal to the adult in me (just because I'm grown up doesn't mean I need a scientific explaination of how the Force works - the Force surrounds us all and binds all things together, or whatever Yoda said the first go around, don't try to explain it, because all you end up doing is calling attention to the fact that it couldn't really exist).  I'd be curious to know what a child thought of it, but if you're like me, someone who loved the V through VII but doesn't still buy Star Wars books, you might find yourself thinking less about the fate of the characters, and more about how cramped your legs feel in the theater.",0

2681,1.0,"Well I for one am a big fan of the original 3 films, my favourite being The Empire Strikes Back, but this film was to put it simply ghastly to watch. It's not as if it's the worst film ever made or anything it's just that it lacked all the things needed to make it a good film or even a slightly worthwhile film. The cast included some good actors but their lines were all really dull. The action scenes like the pod race were totally predictable and offered nothing that hasn't been done before. There was no attempt to be original and this sequence along with other parts of the film was like a simple comic book story using way too expensive special effects. The effects themselves weren't even that good, just plain dull. Jar Jar IS as annoying as everyone says he is and the sheer ludicrous disney style of the ""I wonder what this button does, Oh look I've killed all the bad guys and saved the day"" part at the end defies all sanity. Lucas has lost it. The worst film of the year.",0
2682,1.0,"The Phantom Menace is possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. First of all, while the original trilogy was targeted at young adults and older, Phantom Menace seems to be aimed at children.  The character of Jar Jar Binks is incredibly irritating.  He serves no purpose other than comic relief (although I'm not sure he was all that comical and he sure didn't do too much to relieve anything).  One might recall Lucas's use of R2-D2 and C3P0 for comic relief in the original trilogy and argue that Jar Jar serves the same purpose, but one must also keep in mind, R2 and 3P0 are both in the Phantom Menace as well again providing us with comic relief.  One must also realize, while R2 and 3P0 provide a quick chuckle now and then Jar Jar is meant to be a walking laughfest of slapstick humor and just does not pull that off well at all.  Also, Anakin Skywalker, one of the lead roles, is a child in the movie.  Whereas adult characters appeal to an adult audience, young children appeal to child audiences, only further distancing Phantom Menace from the originals.  And this leads to my second point, Lucas doesn't bother keeping with continuity.  In the original movies, Obi Wan Kenobi claims he first met Anakin Skywalker when Anakin was a rebel fighter pilot, not a young boy.  Lucas blatantly ignores continuity throughout the entire film making it confusing and just painful to watch.  Another thing that killed the movie is Darth Maul.  Maul's face was plastered all over magazines, posters, trailers and ads hyping him as the film's primary villain and then he only gets about 8 minutes of screen time.  What a rip-off!  Lastly, the movie's ending is pointless, confusing, boring, and anti-climactic.",0

I recently watched the despecialized versions of 'Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'. And it made me wonder if Phantom Menace was as bad as I remember it to be.

Here's my take on it: ",0

2685,6.0,"I'm rewatching this movie for the first time since I was a child. The visuals and story are awesome, but the acting is the opposite. The CGI animations have much more expression than the human actors do. It feels like they were cued to just say their lines and not put much effort into their characters/emotions. I'm halfway into the movie, and it's not nearly as good as I reminisced about before watching it again. Most of the acting kind of kills it for me.",0
2686,4.0,"This movie has no business holding the name of Star Wars. It's got some lightsabers... I'll give you that. I hear a lot of people trying to explain this movie in an attempt to downplay how terrible it really was. I don't see the point in that. The original movies were made a certain way, with a certain level of quality. These were not. If Lucas ran out of good script ideas then he should have listened to some fans or better yet, the authors of his book series. They don't seem to have trouble coming up with interesting stories that fit nicely into the Star Wars universe. Star Wars is not about stupid CG characters who are clinically retarded or droids that double as ninjas.",0

As I grew up in the mid 1980's nothing was more cool than Star Wars, Transformers, and Voltron. Though, as I have gotten older I can still have a appreciation for Star Wars even as an adult. The original story and plot lines were superb and the special effects were amazing for its time. The Phantom Menace rather, although it is up to date with all the newest special effects tricks, fails at telling as great of a story as the old films. You are in awe at all the new special effects, but the character development and relationships that those characters have with each other are weak and boring. In the old films I felt like I really got to know the characters individually. Who can forget Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Chewbacca? Whereas now I feel like Anakin Skywalker is being presented as the only important character and all the others are just fillers that really aren't that important. In the end I have to give the movie an A+ on special effects, but only a C- on story and character development. Watch it once, but don't buy on DVD.",0

How come 2 Jedi masters don't carry any kind of international currency so they can buy parts for their spaceships if they break down? Isn't there some kind of credit card they could use or maybe some straight up cash they could laydown? I mention this because it's on this premise that Anakin is introduced to the story. Because they don't carry currency when they travel, they make a bet on a pod race to get the part for their ship. That's just stupid! Half the damn movie is about the fact that Jedi's can't pay for things in cash and they use that to basically introduce the future Darth Vader, which in turn becomes the cohesive thread of the entire series! So if Jedi's could just carry some form of currency around on their important missions, they would have just walked in, bought the part they needed, and been on their merry way! No Darth Vader! Am I the only one that thinks this way?",0
2691,2.0,"I liked the movie, but I wish George Lucas would stop worshipping special effects so much.  What made the first two installments great was that we knew the characters.  The original starts off with a bang, but we then get to know the main characters for the rest of the movie.  Lucas was able to blend the action with an actual story.  Here, it appears that he bought into his own hype.  Star Wars is no religion, no matter how much some people want to believe.  He takes a little bit from each major religion and comes up with the force.  The Senate scenes are wonderful and could be so interesting, but Lucas seems to be too anxious to get back to the war. It's a truly fun movie to see, but it could be more.  A little more humanity and less computerization would enhance the future efforts.",1

I think a major reason I loved it so was because of the slash fanfic feel.

For instance, there were just too many computer generated characters and images.  I know that many movies are all about special effects and that is what draws people to them, but Star Wars movies are NOT like anything else.  I would rather have seen a movie that was less theatrical and more like the originals.  In defense of Lucus, I guess he was just trying to stamp the new millennium on Episode One.  The plot was as good as I would have expected, for a lead-off film.  Little Anakin was certainly no acting marvel.  However, there are scenes were you can see what his character short-comings are, which will eventually lead him to become Darth Vader.  I was impressed by Liam Neeson's role.  His powerful screen presence was certainly a positive for the film. I am confident that in the coming years as Episodes Two and Three hit the screens, the stories will improve significantly.

Also, unlike many summer blockbusters recently, there is a bit of a story, albeit a pretty simple one (just like the originals). The problems really come with the dialogue because it sucks (just like the originals). Someone really should have said ""erm George nice universe and idea and all, but you can't write for toffee"".

First and foremost the thing I love most about this movie is that it is Star Wars.  Even with the amazing computer graphics it felt like all the other movies which is very important to me.  I would like to share with you all how I felt about this movie.  First for the down side. What was up with Jar Jar Binks?  I didn't like him at all!!  It seemed to me that Lucas, even with his wisdom, tried to accommodate the child watchers with a Robin Williams genie character.  His jokes weren't funny and he served no real purpose in the movie.  HE SAID EXSQUEEZE ME!!!! On that comic relief subject I cringed every time  Bass Nass did that face slobbering thing. Darth Maul didn't get enough screen time especially with all the hype he is getting.  He had very few lines and wasn't all that important.  Speaking of over commercializing something what was with the huge push on Mace Windu. He also had next to nothing to do with this film. I would have like to see more of Qui -Gon Jinn but what can you do? Enough negativity! On to the good stuff and boy do I think this movie has a lot of it.  The movie was out of this world.

CGIs did push the limit. Jar Jar and the whole Gungan race got to me. Dialogue seemed a little too earth-based. Never breathed a second and blinked sparingly during the pod race and light saber duels even though I knew what happened. Overall, it was a movie. Titanic's hit the iceberg, sunk, rusted, and faded in our memories after this movie (Oscar and box office wise, thank God!). I know I'll see it again because the whole thing went by too fast. Who knows, maybe I'll gain a second opinion. It's not a movie to miss, nor is it a movie to truly put all previous life on hold for. I, myself, did get a little carried away from my norm (Skipped a half-day of school for tickets and spent about seventy bucks making a costume.) and loved it for the experience and euphoria.

On the positive side, the battles in the movie especially the light-saber battles are fantastic, though at time it seems to slow down, bordering on fake. That's about all I can list.

So, I was first in line, first into the theatre, I sat through it, and I loved it. Not only were the special effects great, but the acting of the Jedi (Neeson and McGregor) was terrific, Natalie Portman was interesting as the queen, and Anakin was excellent.  There wasn't a whole lot of overly intelligent dialogue, but I wasn't expecting it, that's not why I like Star Wars.

I feel he succeeded on all counts.  I am looking forward to the next installment when we, hopefully, will get to see more of Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan Kenobi.",1
2721,5.0,"There must be some mistake.  Please tell me there has been a mistake. Lucas spends two hours on a plot point involving the invasion of a small planet that should have lasted no more than twenty minutes.  This was supposed to be Episode 1, right? ""Phantom"" feels more like Episode 1.5.",0
2722,,"At least that's what I'll have to keep telling myself for the next two years! Upon entering the theatre, my greatest fear was that I would be disappointed. The special effects solved that problem--they were truly amazing, it's now easier for Lucas to give his imagination the reins, he's no longer hampered by impossibilities.",1
2723,,"I don't know if I would call myself a star wars fan, but I did grow up with it and have seen the three other episodes a number of times. To me it seems like people don't really understand what this movie is all about. It is not to be compared with any other movie, let alone the matrix which people have the tendency of doing, the only other films this movie is capable of being compared to is the other Star wars films and even that is quite difficult because of the twenty year gap. Furthermore this movie is not an action picture it's not even really sci fi it is however a fairy tale full of arch types, good vs. evil and the significance of both aspects.",1
2724,1.0,"The myth of Star Wars which has been the birth of a lot of Science-Fiction adventures, some good, some not so good now seems to sabotaged by it's inventor, the great George Lucas himself. It would take a long time to explain what could have been done better on ""Episode One"" but most is just to obvious to oversee. If you look at some of the breathtaking scenes of ""Star Wars"" or ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and compare it with the battles and intrigues of ""The Phantom Menace"" you've to ask: ""Where did all the people go?"" You cannot make a movie which has to represent something like one of the greatest Fantasy Adventures ever with a dozen actors and tons of computer generated imagery. Would there have been no other way to put in a character like Jar Jar Binks than a computer animation? Why the droids? Weren't the Storm Troopers of the three first movies not good enough to fight for the Trade Federation which seems to be technologically far more advanced than the evil galactic empire? In an interview Lucas once said that he wasn't sure about putting in a puppet to play an important character in a movie, now he replaces most the supporting characters in ""Phantom Menace"" by not even touchable computer animations. Lucas put it some really great effects in this movie, but they're so great they don't seem believable. Everything is just to big, to fantastic, to nice rendered. The ships of Star Wars always were machines and not living quicksilver drops. And about the cast. It's a good cast but Lucas really neglected them. He did all he could for the effects and the promotion but he ignored the cast, ignored the living people inside his giant video game. Sometimes it seems he didn't even want them to be more realistic than any of the bits and bytes enemy lines. If this should be the future of film making, men like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor shouldn't cooperate with the force which intends to wipe them out, all of them.",1
2725,6.0,"Loved it! Hated it! Loved it! Hated it! For anyone who is a true Star Wars fan, but also a discriminating moviegoer, this film will pull you in several directions at once. You'll wince whenever Anakin opens his mouth, but when the good ole Tusken raiders start sniping at the pod race you'll grin from ear to ear.  The pulse quickens during scenes like the R2 units crawling about a spaceship exterior during a battle, but such moments are placed between ponderous dialogue sequences with Neeson and McGregor (not their fault). Natalie Portman has some true sparks and her talent shows through her undeveloped character.  When she professes to feel a connection with Anakin you can believe it, which set the stage for the next film wonderfully.  Too bad Jake Lloyd can't emote; she may as well be talking to a wooden doll. The whole thing is of course visually seamless, and sets a new standard for all movies, not just sci-fi. But there's a quote attributed to Harrison Ford on the set during the original movies; ""You can type this sh*! George, but you sure can't say it.""",1
2726,8.0,"Great movie! It was well worth the wait. The story...the characters...the special effects made it all worth while. Although the basic storyline is a little convoluted, it was still a good set-up to the rest of the series. The only real problem I had was with Jar Jar Binks. He was REALLY annoying, and was often hard to understand whenever he spoke. Overall, I give this movie an 8. I think the upcoming episodes will be even better!",1
2727,7.0,"Remember in the first three Star Wars, how there were many scenes where people talked? That's all they were, talking. Getting to know the characters, getting to feel their emotions. No THX sound, no special effects, just the people. That's was what was missing from Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. There was no time where we could really see the characters themselves, with no hi-tech gadgets surrounding them. Remember the scene in the Ewok Village with Han and Leia on the bridge? It was moments like that, moments that brought the characters out to us. These are the things that make Star Wars so good. The effects in this one were unsurpassable. The characters are what is needed to be improved upon. Hopefully this will be done in the next two. Even though its shortcomings, you can tell this looks to be the beginning of a great saga, equaling the measure of its three sequels 20 years ago.",1
2728,10.0,I know a lot of people have had mixed feelings about this movie but I've seen it twice so far and I want to see it more.

2729,8.0,"I went into this expecting something new.  That was my first mistake. There is nothing new in this movie.  I knew the plot beforehand, but I was really hoping Lucas would make at least a half-hearted attempt at originality insofar as the presentation goes.  There is no need for anyone to see this movie, as anyone who has seen the second trilogy has already witnessed every plotline presented in Episode I.  I will say that the whole sabre fight was about 8 zillion times cooler than anything in episodes 4, 5, and 6, though.",0
2730,10.0,"The Phantom Menace, in and of itself, is a great movie.  I stress ""in and of itself"" because Star Wars is one of the greatest movies of our time, and you cannot expect a Citizen Kane of every movie in a series. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect.  Jar Jar wasn't an annoying character, but his voice was obnoxious, and trying to understand him was at times a nearly impossible task.  The special effects were breathtaking, so much so that they upstaged the actors in many cases.  I think Lucas should cut back on his CGI use; it gets excessive at times.  There are many long sequences with no human acting; it gets almost too cartoony.  Finally, the characters were grossly underdeveloped, particularly Darth Maul, who could have been portrayed like another Vader as opposed to a mute comic book character.  A tough, scary, and truly bad comic book character, to be sure.",0
2731,1.0,"I'd give this movie a 5 out of 10.  In a nutshell it was a movie of extreme qualities (both terrific and horrible) which wound up canceling each other out, leaving me with an impression of averageness.  I'm a Star Wars fan (so I'm naturally inclined to cut the film some slack) but for the price of a theater ticket these days I'd prefer to see a movie with a little more emphasis and care in writing and acting.",0
2732,4.0,"First of all, I was very impressed by this film visually (how could you not be) and, in particular, the lightsaber fight at the end was cool to the point of overload. Overall, however, this film was a disappointment for me, but not in the same way as the critics.  True, the characters weren't as vivid as the other movies, but that doesn't bother me because the two main characters in SW1 were Jedi and therefore were supposed to be solemn as opposed to eccentric. What bothered me were the implausibilities, inconsistencies, and cameos of characters that were only in the movie so the audience would cheer. C-3PO's part in the film was ridiculous because in SW4, when he was on Tatooine, he told Luke he didn't know what planet he was on and I doubt he'd forget.  Threepio may be a coward, but he's not an idiot.  Also, the idea that Anakin built him and 30 years later, of all people, Luke ends up buying him is just too much of a coincidence for me to swallow.  Let me get this straight, not only is Vader Luke's father and Leia Luke's sister, but now Threepio's his brother?  Come on!  What is this a Sci-Fi soap opera?  Next thing you know, in episodes 2 & 3, Chewbacca will be Anakin's dog! R2-D2's part also seemed forced.  Any arbitrary droid would have sufficed in that role and it seems like, again Lucas put him in there just to have a familiar character. One thing I've always wondered is why does Lucas feel compelled to keep coming back to Tatooine?  Is he running out of ideas for planets or does he just like filming in the desert?  You'd think in the vastness of space with as many aliens you see in these films, odds are Luke and Anakin would come from different planets. Space battle at the end seemed forced, too.  At one point, they're shooting each other on Naboo, the next, they're shooting each other in space.  It wasn't like SW4&6 when they had a set-up so we knew what the point of the attack was.  I didn't even know what they were trying to accomplish, until they accomplished it.  It seemed with the obligatory climactic dog fight and maximum possible cameos, that Lucas was trying to re-create the Star Wars formula with no logical reasoning. Maybe I'm being too analytical, but I don't consider myself a huge Star Wars fan and If I can spot these flaws without any real effort, how come Lucas can't?  After 16 years, I expected more authenticity.",0
2733,4.0,"1.  A number of the aliens in the movie are blatantly racist. 2.  Action begins too quickly at the beginning.  Come on, this is the first movie!  You gotta have at least a little more set up other than the words that scroll up. 3.  In ""A New Hope"", Obi-Wan didn't know who R2-D2 was even though they had plenty of scenes together in ""The Phantom Menace"".  R2-D2 should have been left out of this movie.  Any droid could have been in his place. 4.  Also, in ""A New Hope"", C-3PO didn't recognize Tattooine even though, according to ""The Phantom Menace"", it's his home planet.  I doubt he'd forget that, after all, he's a protocol droid.  He shouldn't have been in this movie, either.  It's obvious Lucas put him in so we could see Artoo and Threepio meet. 5.  Anakin built C-3PO.  So let me get this straight:  In ""The Empire Strikes Back"" we found out that Vader is Luke's father.  Then, in ""Return of the Jedi"" we found out that Leia is Luke's sister.  Now, in ""The Phantom Menace"" we find out that C-3PO is Luke's half-brother.  What is this, sci-fi soap opera? 6.  The odds that R2-D2 flew with both Anakin and Luke are ridiculous. Another reason Artoo should have been omitted from episode one. 7.  Too much Jar Jar Binks. 8.  Not enough Darth Maul. 9.  At the beginning, the two Jedis demonstrate that they can hold their breath for a long time.  A little later in the movie, when they go swimming, they pull out these handy-dandy ""breathalizers"" for underwater breathing. I find it hard to believe the Jedi find it necessary to carry stuff like that around with them all the time if they have the ability to hold their breath so long. 10. Boss Nass does this stupid Jackie Gleason mimicry.  If he was in it as much as Jar Jar, he'd be even more annoying. 11. There's this 2-headed alien named Fode-Beed who's too ""contemporary American"".  Kind of like the genie in ""Aladdin"", he just doesn't fit in because his persona is such a sign of the times. 12. In the other movies, Darth Vader appears to have an English accent (even after the helmet comes off) while in ""The Phantom Menace"", young Anakin is obviously a Yankee. 13. Too much use of the word ""Yippee!"" 14. People keep calling Anakin ""Ani"".  I kept waiting for him to start singing ""The sun'll come ooouuut tomorrow..."" 15. In one scene, a battle droid uses binoculars.  If it's a robot, why not just make the binoculars built-in? 16. There was no set-up before the climatic space battle.  One minute, they're fighting on the planet, the next, they're fighting in space.  Even ""Empire"" had a quick 30-second ""here's what we're gonna do"" before the snow speeder battle.  In ""Phantom""  I didn't even know what they were trying to accomplish until they accomplished it. 17. The difference between people in alien costumes and computer animated aliens is too obvious.  When they're combined, they both look equally fake. 18. Yoda looks too different.  Why didn't they just use the same puppet? If he's 900 years old, I doubt he'd look so different between 30 years.  He looks phonier, too. 19. Certain characters were too cartoony.  Sure, they looked cool, but they looked more like they belonged in ""A Bug's Life"" rather than a live action movie. 20. The whole movie was basically  one long toy/video game commercial with talented performers wasted at the mercy of special effects. 21. Anakin ""accidentally"" blows up the Federation ship. 22. The whole Padme/Amidalla role reversal is confusing. 23. Anakin is an immaculate conception of the Force.  Oh, puh-leeze! 24. The notion that organic particles make up the Force cheapens the whole mysticism.  That's a ""Star Trek"" move. 25. Qui-Gonn ""hangs on"" after being impaled through the chest by a light saber.",0

George Lucas' dream come true saga has everyone talking.  From what I saw he put forward a tremendous effort in all except the writing.  I am not a professional writer but Hollywood is crawling with them!  If you spent ~ $120 million making the dream come true, you should have budgeted in a million or two for writers.  I have seen better plots on half-hour sitcoms and I'm accustomed to more clever dialog from my buddies at work.  Honestly, my ten-year-old could write a better story; I'll correct the grammar for free.  I apologize for being so critical, after all, maybe it's just supposed to read like a comic book.

ANH and TESB both got 10s from me and ROTJ was in there with a 9. why the nine? those annoying ewoks. now we have the phantom menace. it has the best effects ever. the most awesome bad guy ever, the coolest sabor fights EVER (really fast moves, lots of flips, really really incredible), and a jaw dropping pod race... it gets an 8. why you ask? two reasons: first, that annoying fish guy ja ja needs to take a flying leap. every time that salmon opened his mouth i started to make fists and grind my teeth. if you thought the ewoks were annoying, wait till you get a load of this guppie. the second problem was the flow. it was choppy. the smooth start to finish feel of the original three is gone. part of the reason for this problem is that George had to tell a more complicated story and answer some long unanswered questions. the choppy feel can be forgiven because it allows us to learn a lot about the star wars universe. that annoying fish, however, cannot be forgiven. i can think of only one explanation for his dumb antics and stupid lines: george is abandoning his original audience and concentrating on 5 year olds. could this be why people in TPM can get socked right in the eye without showing any physical evidence of the blow (unlike luke in TESB, the people in this movie do not look beat up after what was almost as tough a fight as the Bespin duel)? did Lucas sell out in hopes of making more money on action figures? say it aint so, George. all in all, i recommend this movie for the reasons stated above, but keep in mind that it does not have the magic that the original three had. the sad part is that it could have. if someone had cut most of ja ja's lines out and if Anakin's conflicting feelings about leaving home were explored more, we would have gotten a star wars movie. If the sabor fight and pod race were longer, we would have gotten a really good star wars movie.",0

Lucas starts us out with our two jedis Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. And Lucas already gives us a taste of a STAR WARS action sequence.

And brief glimpses of cities and landscapes exist which you wish you could still-frame in order to lavish your attention upon them.  Regardless, the sum total of the film falls far short of the wit, bravado and mystery of Episodes IV, V, and VI.  It took me awhile to ""get into"" the movie because of the new characters, but also the Gunga (a donkey head on a human body) really irritated me.  What an embarrassingly stupid sidekick in comparison to Chewbacca!  Most bothersome of all however was the lack of mystery.  Before we wondered if Luke and Leia were brother and sister.  Was Vader their father? Or Hans, or who's? Was Obi-wan, Vader's brother?  Etc., etc.  There's none of these questions to care about in SW1 and the movie suffers terribly because of it.",0
2743,8.0,"Being someone blinded by the hype the first time I saw The Phantom Menace and all the negative reviews that critics gave to this movie, I am not surprised that some SW fans did not like this movie too much. However, I believe that the preceding sentence IS the reason why people did not like this film as much as the original trilogy. My advice to those who did not like the Phantom Menace... Watch it again, but this time objectively. Forget about the hype, the critic's reviews, and the original trilogy.. Just watch this film as it is and I am sure that you will like it MUCH better the second time around.. Like I did. As for my case, I have seen this movie 3 times already (planning on seeing it again next week)because I truly ENJOY this movie! I guess after I saw the movie the first time I was disappointed.. Soon thereafter, I thought about it for a long time and realized that my reasons for disliking the movie were unjustified and due to unfair comparison between this movie (which was just an intro-- a setup btw) and the original trilogy. Which brings me to my next point.. Guys and Gals! Get a grip! The Phantom Menace IS just an intro. Lucas did not mean it to have the profound character development and darkness that Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi had. In one way this movie resembled A New Hope. Like ANH, TPM just threw out all the main characters onto the scene without a proper introduction.. The characters were flat and 2-dimensional.. But hey! This has been Lucas' style for the first movie of both trilogies. I think that his approach is genius. Why? Well, just imagine how good the second and third episodes would be if all (or most) of the character development/plot had been used up in the first movie...That would be catastrophic! Since this first Episode IS just an intro with little character development (much like A New Hope was)it is unfair to compare this movie to Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi which were fantastic, serious, and dark plot-heavy sequels. I think too many people expected this movie to be like the Empire Strikes Back (for instance) which is why they were left disappointed. Trust me! the purpose of this movie is to have fun, to become acquainted with the characters, and to appreciate all the foreshadowing and cues that this movie set up magnificently for a darker, more plot-heavy Episode 2.",1
2744,,"I was SO worried about the new ""Star Wars"" installment.  For nearly a year, my brother and I discussed it, sure that with all the new ""gimmicks"" Lucas was putting in, he would forget to really make it what ""Star Wars"" is all about in the first place.  I even wrote a song about it!  (The chorus says: ""I'm a little worried about Star Wars/Episode One..."" and gets even more disparaging from there.  Catchy song though.) The truth was, though, that in the long run I'm just a ten-year-old trapped in an adult's body, and I REALLY wanted this movie to blow me away and make me unstoppably-grinningly, eyes-wide, breath-gone happy.  So despite all my complaints to friends and family, when I got out of rehearsal that fateful Tuesday night, I got home, hopped in the car, and drove to a little theater in my hometown that I knew NOBODY even was aware they were playing Episode One.  The whole way I hoped and prayed I'd like the movie.  I was one of five people in the theater (I called my brother but he had to work the next day!) for the one o'clock showing....and it was magic.  Honestly, from someone who was thoroughly expecting it to be horrible (but hoping it would be wonderful), I was REALLY happy with the movie.  The special effects I'm sure you can all judge for yourselves (fantastic).  The only problem I had there was some of the movement of computer-generated characters was a little unnatural (though the same was fortunately not true of any other computer-generated stuff).  The critics' idea of the acting being wooden is ridiculous - the only ""wooden"" acting I saw was some scenes with Natalie Portman, in which it was *appropriate* for her to be so low-key (watch royalty in the presence of peons sometime, right?).  And Jar Jar Binks - well, at first I thought he was cute, then I got a *little* irritated by him, and by the time they got to Tatooine, I just didn't mind anymore, he was just himself and I dealt with it, no problem. Then there's the complaint that most people have...this movie doesn't seem to stand up well on it's own.  But, come on, people, that's the whole POINT! If anyone recalls, Episode Five (""The Empire Strikes Back"") was applauded for the guts it took to leave it so open-ended, which Lucas was able to do because he knew he was going to make another sequel.  With ""The Phantom Menace,"" he knows he's going to make TWO more movies in this storyline. So of course he can leave it open-ended.  And personally, the only thing that bothers me about this is that I won't be able to see the other two movies for another three and six years respectively! Conclusion: loved it, saw it the next night, then saw it again two days later, and I'd love to see it again.  Can't wait for the next ones. However, it looks like my brother and I will have even more sleepless nights before the next two: thanks to the ABHORRENT rumor that Leonardo DiCaprio has been approached by Lucas (presumably for the role of Anakin).

Ok, that last one is a little broad I admit. But, we have all grown up with Star Wars, we know names and places and facts so trivial, outsiders think us to be strange.

The movie met those expectations and then some. I don't know what those people that were upset by the movie were expecting. It was the most visually amazing movie ever. The detail of the cgi-generated effects blew my mind. And the fact that a lot of the characters in the movie are completely made from a computer also amazed me.

Talk about crappy dialogue. Sure, there wasn't much character development, but see what happens when you try to do that in a Sci-Fi movie. They don't mix. The only thing that sucks is that I have to wait another three years until Episode 2.",1
2755,7.0,"Don't expect any wonderful themes or social issues expressed.  There is a small political message however.  It is just your common summer movie.  It has special effects, and oh how wonderful they are.  It has not the same heart as its predecessor but it has heart all the same.  I went to the theaters in hopes of being dazzled and I was.  It was no real gem of a movie, but it didn't need to be.  I had thought TITANIC was something good until I saw it for the second time and realized that it wasn't.  THE PHANTOM MENACE is just one of your typical summer movies and once you accept this as true you could have no trouble with plot or characters.",1
2756,8.0,"In general the film is lots of fun with just some minor detractions.  The #1 detraction has to be Jar-Jar Binks.  I hated that character and found myself wishing that he would get squished sometime during the film.  The only other detraction is that the purpose of the film seems to set up the events of the following two films while contributing very little to the overall storyline. Besides these relatively minor criticisms, the movie is exciting, engrossing and visually stunning. The lightsaber fight is one of the best ""sword fights"" I've seen in any movie.",1
2757,9.0,"This is a great movie if you are really into the Star Wars Saga, which I am.

But, if you like to see lots of special effects and really well done combat scenes, this is a must see.",1
2758,6.0,"The Star Wars that we all grew up with and loved so dearly is now dead. Sadly, this film does not live up to expectations, nor does it sufficiently engross us to make us unaware of its obvious flaws. Star Wars has always been a very simple story interlaced with a variety of interesting and spectacular moments that has made the jaw drop or the eyelids peel, but for some inexplicable reason, George Lucas has strayed from his original 'plan' in an attempt to please adults and children alike. Lucas uses child-like characters in a movie interspersed with political propaganda to try and accomplish this and the result of which is the self destruction of the franchise that made him so successful in the first place. Chinese and Jamaican-like aliens litter the screen as we are subjected to line after line of bad, stereotypical language that just doesn't affect you in any way except excercising the muscles in your face that affect cringing. Although this film did wow us with its special effects, they too were over done. The battes in this movie (except with Darth Maul) were horrible. You were not able to concentrate on anything as objects were being blown apart every which way. Do you remember the glorious battle on Hoth? Now that's how to do a battle.",0
2759,9.0,"Thank you, George Lucas, you did a great movie!!! I've never seen such excellent special effects before, and also the story is really great. These were two hours I'll remember my entire live.",1
2760,,"I was perfectly at home with a blue demon salesman that flapped around in the air against all principles of areodymamics, and comfortable with the hairless Chihuahua-man who walked on his hands, but I found little Anakin Skywalker, played by 8 year old Jake Lloyd, rather strange, even in the setting that he was in. Although the boy is appealing, there are critical instances where he seems odd and contrived. Anakin has the face of a six year old, is about the size of a nine year old, and often acts as if he is past thirty years of age. When young Anakin drives his pod with equanimity that marine combat pilots could envy, I chalked it up to precociousness and perhaps the effect of the ""Force"" within him. His tremendous courage and resilience I attributed to worldliness created by a harsh childhood of slavery. However, what struck me as unnatural about the boy was the clumsy foundation set for the love relationship Anakin will have with Queen Amidala in the next two films.",1
2761,,"I think the aspect of the film that I like second best would have to be Queen Amidala and the setting of Naboo. Her capital city is beautiful: a futuristic seaside community built of antique Byzantine architecture done in weathered shades of cream, copper, and aqua, it reminded me of those fabulous ""Dinotopia"" paintings that used to be so popular. There was even a hangar for the queen's spaceship (which looked too much like an SR-71 for my tastes) that was built of stone. What a nice touch that was; Disney couldn't have done it better. Natalie Portman plays the queen and is well suited to the elaborate surroundings, dressed up in gear that is often quite imaginative, and its use is integral to the story, rather than gratuitous. (Later, we find out that there is a reason for all the care Amidala takes with her appearance, other than trying to compensate for being fourteen years old and a world's only ruler.) With her glossy dark tresses, regal monotone voice, and elaborate costumes, the adolescent queen seems to be an otherworldly blend of a Japanese geisha and Elizabeth I, and I found it to be a pleasing mixture. However, at times, Amidala's costumes were at cross- purposes with her character. The slight actress looked a little unsteady under the heavy headdresses, and my biggest fault with Ms. Portman was her posture. Queens, even if they are popularly elected, lack credibility if they slouch. Some of the costumes lacked originality, also. I saw some coiffeurs that must have come straight from ""Babylon 5"" and at times, the young queen looked a little too much like ""Beetle Juice's"" Lydia, with her penchant for feather trimmed black dresses and pallid cosmetics. The worst outfit, and the most distracting, had to be the ensemble Amidala wore when she addressed the Senate. With her sad expression, and her lovely face painted white with red dots on the cheeks, the young queen wore a harlequin shaped hat that made her look like entirely too much like a French clown doll. I couldn't decide if this was done on purpose or not, but I think a more suitable choice of wardrobe could have been made.",0
2762,,"I have to say the best thing about ""The Phantom Menace"" had to be the introduction of the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. I liked the older Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn also. Qui-Gon was perfect as the thoughtful, sage Jedi Master, but it was in Obi-Wan, in the scene where he turns and reassures little Anakin that he will train him, that the goodness of the ""Force"" can be seen the most clearly. Ewan McGregor's face is strong, his voice rich and gentle, and he is innocent and knowing at the same time: an extraordinarily charismatic combination of traits. Due to McGregor's care with his character's demeanor, and we get the sense that with Obi-Wan, newly stepped into manhood, wonderful things are just around the corner. In other words, McGregor steps right into Sir Alec Guiness's shoes, playing the unforgettable character set by this world class actor in the first trilogy, rather than impersonating him, as I had feared might happen. Not just another pretty face, I think that McGregor's success with Obi-Wan Kenobi is due to his painstaking study of his character as well as his devotion to playing all dimensions of his role equally well. With swordplay, I think McGregor is more adept at his role than even his Scots counterpart, Duncan MacLeod, of the ""Highlander"" series, (played by another Brit, Adrian Paul). McGregor can handle a blade like no one else, to the point of raising movie hacking and slashing to an art form. The battle scene where the Jedi knights battle Ray Park's Darth Maul was incredibly well developed. The choreography and grace of all three actors combines for the dramatic highlight of the film. Their movements were fluid, blending strength with speed and dexterity. McGregor, as Kenobi, is astounding with his agility and fierceness, defying gravity over and over. Luke and Darth Vader's battles were never like this. I have to add that Ray Park's martial arts background adds to McGregor's performance nicely to create a truly amazing scene, made all the more meaningful as we can see what is going through the hearts and minds of the combatants as they struggle. There is a part where Qui-Gon Jinn kneels, waiting for a force field to be lifted so he can continue battling his demonic enemy. The talented Neeson gives us an expression and body language that tells the audience that Qui-Gon knows what is to happen to him when the field is lifted, and the quiet courage with which he rises and fights again makes the battle go deeper than shallow, gratuitous violence.",1
2763,9.0,"This movie is truly worthy of the trilogy. Although Jar-Jar is very annoying, the lightsaber duel at the end alone is worth the admission price. The plot fits nicely with the rest of the movies. George Lucas is brilliant. This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.",1
2764,7.0,"I don't usually go to movie theatre, but instead, wait 6 months and rent the videos. However, I made an exception for Episode I, because you need a cinema as big as possible in order to fully appreciate George Lucas' Sound and Visual Effects. And Mr. Lucas did not disappoint at all. The underwater world in Naboo, the Podracing, and the Senate chamber were all breathtaking. As much as I am a Star Wars fan, I do have to point out some of the disappointments: 1) The story opening with a dispute with the Trade Federation seems a little weak for a great Epic. 2) The general lack of depth in the dialogue. 3) The final sequence, in terms of style, was an exact replica of that in Return of the Jedi - the simultaneous battles in outer space, on the ground, and among the masters of the Force. This could have been an average movie but there was one surprisingly inspirational element: Queen Armidila. I was totally impressed by her. Her character had vision, leadership, and courage. and yet throughout the movie there was trace of tenderness and vulnerability. She will be the main reason that I look forward to Episode II.",0
2765,7.0,"The Phantom Menace (I think the name was an inside joke: The Fandom Menace) I find to have the same qualities as the first three.  The movie sets standards for visual effects.  The characters are archetypical, and there is not much to them.  Now let's get down to specifics.",0
2766,8.0,"This was a long awaited film for me. I grew up on Star Wars, so it means a lot to me. I've expected a little more inventive story and a complete story-telling. Somehow I feel the characters weren't truly explained and presented. The whole film was a little bit in a rush, but it can be forgiven for the tied hands of Mr. Lucas. The special effects are really amazing (from now on there are no limits). The final clash between the Jedi and the Sith lord with the music and design made me to give a full score for this movie. (But if The Empire Strikes scores 10 The Phantom Menace only makes 7.) I expect Episode III to become the best from this trilogy. ""I hope my feelings will serve me well!"" ""May the force be with us!""",1
2767,10.0,"After you saw the original starwars in 1977, you left the theater with a good feeling. After seeing Phantom Menace, you left the theater asking yourself many questions. Why didn't Qui Gonn disappear after his death? Who were the trade federation and why was it so important to takeover the planet of Naboo? Why couldn't Yoda and the Jedi council detect the presence of a sith? What's the story with Senator Palpatine and his secret identity (darth sidious), where did he come from, and what are his intentions? I'm sure some of these questions will be answered in episode 2, but why make us wait? Obviously  this film was more of a setup to the rest of the episodes, rather an all-time classic the media built it up to be. Here are some more questions: Why bring back JarJar Binks in episode 2, if he was hated so much in ep1? Almost everybody who saw Ep1 couldn't stand him, he was so annoying. Another question: Is it really necessary to include so much digital effects in a movie, if the whole point to a movie is to tell a story? George obviously got carried away with the power of ILM.",0
2768,7.0,"For the time being, I'm going to stay out of the liked versus didn't like controversy surrounding SW Episode I.  I'll reserve my opinion for a later date.  I did want to mention one thing about the ending credits that was chilling.",1
2769,,"Overall, it was a good movie but considering how long Lucas had this in his head I wasn't too impressed. I know he has an amazing mind (see his first movie...THX 1138) but I feel like he was trying to satisfy too many categories of moviegoers all at once. As a result the movie detracted from itself.",1
2770,8.0,"Episode I is entertaining, but there are some problems.  Some things (the pod race and the Jedi duel) were better than any similar scenes in the rest of the series.  The main problem is that there is a child character (with annoying dialogue) as well as cartoonish character (with even more annoying dialogue) aimed at children.  This makes the movie come off as a kids movie. At least it didn't have a dog in it.",0
2771,10.0,Let me start by explaining why I think Star Wars got such mixed reviews.,0
2772,7.0,"I loved the original star wars movies and was a bit disappointed, there was not that magic which I felt in the other movies. But let's have a look at some very important points: The original movies had great characters like Darth Vader, Luke, Hand and Lea. Nobody of them appears in this movie. So in my opinion it's quite difficult to replace such impressive people with others. Also note, that ""A New Hope"" starts in the middle of war. ""The Phantom Menace"" starts elsewhere, what explains that this story can't be that dramatic like "" A new hope"". There are great scenes in this movie, but everything seemed very different from the original trilogy. The trilogy had like a thin red line through the whole story, but the phantom menace is like something else, completely different. Let's hope that George Lucas will put the pieces together and we finally see a complete story with six good films.",1
2773,10.0,"I have read and heard a number of reasons that this movie did not live up to it's predecessors.  Personally, I loved it.  I went into it with the only expectation I felt was reasonable.  The beginning of the story.  That's all. Nothing more was necessary.  We knew the future of the story, but we needed the starting point.  That is what George Lucas gave us.  Now I know a lot of you out there have some gripes, so let's examine a few.",1
2774,,"Choose good films, drama with right angle turns, comedy with tears at the end, war that shows war. Choose acting that burns a character into your memory, lighting that hypnotises, camera work that puts you in the driver seat. Choose plots that a writer can be proud of. I didn't, I chose not too, and the reason? Who needs reasons when you've got STAR WARS.",1
2775,6.0,"I was ready for this movie, being a fan of the originals.  I wasn't really expecting anything great out of this flick and that's why I wasn't disappointed when I saw it. The acting from many of the performers wasn't the greatest. The writing was pretty weak.  Yes, it was made for children.  I had to reach into my inner-child in order to finally enjoy The Phantom Menace.",0
2776,8.0,"Yes, the movie could have been better. I don't agree that the veteran acting was all that spectacular. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are accomplished talented actors and they didn't seem to have any motivation for the scenes they were in. They tried hard. I give them points for trying. But ""try not do or do not there is no try"" as a short alien with big ears might say.",0
2777,4.0,"Well, I was generally disappointed with this film.  It had started well enough, the usual Star Wars fan-fare and scrolling intro to get people in the mood, but too much time was lost in the middle with a stupid pod race.  Really, the two Jedis should have just made an appearance at the race and observed young Anakin to be good with the force and then take it upon themselves to train him.. the plot of having to raise money for a Hyperdrive was pretty poor.",0
2778,,"This film is very entertaining, exciting and worthwhile, especially for the die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan.  It is rather eerie to watch Anakin Skywalker as a young boy, knowing that he will eventually turn into the evil Darth Vader in later movies.",1
2779,,"This jaded 40 year old took some cajoling in order to go and see this film. After the usual toys/cornflake box/stickers/chocolate /crisp packets, and God knows what else they merchandised, you really need an open mind to locate the movie beneath all the enforced froth and brand stretching. So I went, after my brother whose opinions I value, said it was good. I am so glad. This was the best film I have seen in several years. Perhaps the best ever Sci-Fi film. To love it, simply be 19 again and pretend its 1977 and you are not a jaded adult. Find the inner child inside you and simply enjoy it for what it is. Entertainment. I cannot believe the number of bad reviews given to this film. The people that wrote them are humourless clods who have forgotten how to live. Or someone the size of Lucas is so easy an Aunt Sally, that they can't resist their pseudo intellectual critiques. Its so easy to throw mud. To make a film this good is far far harder. Impossible for most of us. How long must we wait for Episode 2? I want it now!",1
2780,,"Okay, I have seen at least 50 reviews from you people on this movie, and funny thing is, like it or not, they are all basically the same criticisms. I saw the film last night for the fifth time, and I loved it more each time. The first time I was disappointed, but the more I see it the better it gets. Perhaps it is simply not fair to judge such a big story after one viewing with too high of expectations. I am a classic Star Wars fan, saw Episode IV at 8 and grew up with it. Now for my comments. People have been complaining about Liam Neeson's performance, but I thought he was great. I love Qui-Gon, a very original Jedi character, a bit of a rogue/ronin, but totally dedicated to the Force. I eat up every line. Jar Jar. It was unfortunate Lucas decided to go for forced humor rather than let humor come naturally of the circumstances, like the dialogue in the original trilogy. I wished Jar Jar would have been a serious character like Chewie, another alien owing a  life debt to a human. I would have liked Jar Jar to be competent, not Jack Tripper. This stuff is never funny in any situation. Physically he was not funny at all, but his dialect and some of his lines were very funny. I find myself laughing at different things each time I see it. I almost wept for joy when I saw that Ian McDarmid would return as Palpatine, the true villain of the saga. George PLEASE give us the full poop on Palpatine. Don't let the movies go by without giving us all of it: how did he become a Sith, how does he train Anakin, etc. Natalie Portman has a real grasp on her role. She is a very talented young actress and very beautiful. Ewan was perfect. I look forward to him growing into the person he is in Star Wars. I liked his emotional devastation when Qui-Gon died. Everyone is complaining about the midichlorian thing, but I totally accept it as part of the whole myth. Bring it on. The notion that midichlorians conceived Anakin is a fascinating development. I look forward to more. I too was disappointed that Darth Maul didn't do more, but again he was, like Vader later, muscle. Palpatine doesn't want too clever of a pupil or he would be a threat. Having seen it over and over, he was used just perfectly. And what a duel. Here are my DOs and DON'Ts for Episode II, and I would be happy to help write the screenplay for no pay. DO cast a talented unknown to play Anakin. He must be physically large. DO allow John Williams' score to be heard! You literally cannot hear the music in most of TPM because of the dialogue and sound effects. A waste, because this is another great SW soundtrack. DON'T go for cheap laughs. DO demand more emotion from the actors. Finally, prepare to meet Mon Mothma, a young Tarkin (I hope!!!), Bail Organa, and don't be afraid to make it a little less ""kiddish."" For Episode III, I want to see a thoroughly corrupted Anakin, the triumph of Palpatine, and the slaughter of the Jedi. Obi-Wan will be utterly devastated by his failure. ""I thought I could instruct Anakin as well as Yoda. I was wrong."" I can see that Obi-Wan will try to emulate the defiance of his own mentor Qui-Gon, but it will backfire. Lighten up folks, this one had to set up everything, and for all its flaws, I welcome it as Episode I and look forward to the next two.",1
2781,6.0,"Personally, I went to this movie with hopes higher than the budget of this hollow movie. Seeing it on the opening night at midnight, I sat wondering ""what went wrong?"" The movie's got superior special effects to all the ""original"" trilogy, and a plot which, unfortunately, does not follow suit. The film is built around George Lucas' love for the hollow world of computer generated imagery, which dazzles us (the podrace sequence) but still left me feeling unfulfilled. If there were as much time dedicated to the human characters (almost none of which I found likeable) as were dedicated to the effects, this movie would be a masterpiece the likes of which we've never seen. However, it falls short in a kick in the stomach kind  of disappointment.",0
2782,7.0,"First, the Phantom Menace is not a bad film. In fact it is quite good in places. I probably rate it as the third best Star Wars movie, behind Empire and AOH. The main problem is with the CGI character of Jar Jar Binks. By the end of the film I was hoping that Darth Maul would kill him off. No such Luck! The film also drags a bit during the period spent on Tatoutine where we first find Anakin. The final light sabre battle is certainly the best fight between Jedi and Sith in all the films. So to sum up, not as good as it could have been. George could you make the next more dark like Empire please!",0
2783,,"When I was on my way to the theater with my boyfriend and his brother, I was extatic. It was opening night and I got free tickets. The show that I saw, was nothing like I expected. Unlike the others, there were no fuzzy little animals that I would have loved to take home with me, instead, there was a stupid alien that drove me crazy through out the entire film. I sat through the movie praying he would die, but to no avail. I am quiet disappointed, where's Chewy and the rest of the characters we have grown to love? At least give us a few that we could have enjoyed. I like the movie, but was disappointed. But I have to admit, Luke looks a whole lot better when he's little.",0
2784,,"I've heard a lot of people complain about this movie in many ways and most of them in my opinion need to remember one very important thing about going to see a movie, especially one in a series of movies: DO NOT GO TO THE MOVIE WITH A SET OF PREJUDICES/EXPECTATIONS!!  You will almost always be disappointed since the chance of the movie actually going exactly how you expected it to go are close to nothing.  That is the biggest problem with this movie.  People go expecting to see Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, etc... and are disappointed when they get to see full-fledge Jedi Knights as the main characters, something we really only got to see a glimpse of in A New Hope with Obi-Wan in his advanced years.  So, these Jedi's aren't like Han & Luke, being more calm and sometimes not as easy to relate to as a result.",1
2785,,"Now, I am a huge Star Wars fan. When the new movie came out I was all psyched about seeing it I couldn't wait. But i was very disappointed when I saw it. The filmmakers focused on the effects too much, which killed the storyline. The acting was good, the effects were good (don't get me wrong), but they were used way too much. Now if you're one of those Star Wars freaks who would pay $50 to see a sold out Star Wars movie at 1:00 in the morning, then you'll love this one. If you're like me, who'se a relatively big Star Wars fan, you may or may not like it. But if you are don't care for it that much, avoid it.",0

2789,,"It seems to be a trend these days with all big blockbuster up-coming movies. They buy the best actors but don't use them to their own advantage.  They put hundreds of scenes of special effects into the movie for the geeks. Sorry guys, but you are.  They add stupid characters like Jar Jar Binks who are not pivotal to the plot anywhere, but are only there to sell more action figurines.  This is why more and more people are focusing on independent movies.  Little budget for special effects, great plot/story content. Didn't the original ""Star Wars"" have a little budget?  And how come the space ships and cruisers in this movie look more advanced than the ones in the future?",0
2790,,"Phantom Menace has received loads of flak from the critics, and I agree with a lot of it. I don't mean that the movie isn't worth seeing, but there ARE some shortcomings. First of all, the character Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't funny, he's annoying. Some could argue that he's just like R2-D2 or Yoda, but they don't really get on your nerves they way he does. Then there's the ugly fact that many of the aliens in Phantom Menace resembled certain ethnic groups. The Trade Federation aliens sounded unmistakably Oriental. The Gungans sounded (and in the case of their leader, looked) vaguely Jamaican. There is some explaining to be done. Also, the screenplay doesn't allow for much character development, if any. If the acting seems poor, don't blame the actors. It's the script's fault. And, although polished and well done, the special effects are, really, nothing special. Remember that when Star Wars came out, no one had ever seen anything like it. The computer animation and digital effects in Phantom Menace are good, very good, but they're not revolutionary. The entire movie is just not up to Star Wars' standards. This movie is geared toward a younger target audience than any of the others. In fact, it's almost a children's movie. The two aren't in the same class. Star Wars was nominated for, among other awards, Best Picture, and Best Screenplay. The only awards Phantom Menace has a chance of being nominated for are the technical ones. And those aren't guaranteed wins, either. Of course, the movie has good points, too. The cast (with the notable exception of Jake Lloyd) is excellent, Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman standing out. And the final lightsaber dual between the two Jedi and Darth Maul is superb. I think that it's George Lucas's own fault that Phantom Menace was not as popular as Star Wars. First re-releasing the original trilogy, then coming up with the special edition, all designed to make people interested in Star Wars again. But it worked too well. He got people's expectations up so high that no movie could have satisfied them. It's a shame. But I'm waiting eagerly for Episode II anyway. George Lucas knows what he's doing, and I wouldn't be surprised if Episode II knocks everyone's socks off.",0
2791,,"Ok. For a start, let's get this Jar Jar issue out of the way. Kids may have loved him. Some adults may have loved him. However, the way he was employed in the movie was somewhat contradictory. One minute we are expected to be feeling how overwhelmingly hopeless the big battle is. The next we are forced to witness Jar Jar's clown-like prancing among the throes of battle. How can Lucas justify such a contradictory. scene. I am not totally anti-Jar Jar. In some calmer moments i could see his comedic appeal. However, the battle scene felt like the gory first ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but with Jim Carrey flopping around doing misplaced Jerry Lewis routines.",0

Yes, the special effects are more advanced, but in the original the story was a lot better. But I did definately enjoy the fight scenes. They were without a doubt the highlight for me. I won't waste your time talking about the character of Jar-Jar Binks, but I will say this . . . What happened to Chewbacca!!!

To start, it was way too FX intensive; the computer animation was excellent, true, but it distracted from the fact that the movie is weak in character and plot development, two of the things that set A New Hope and sequels apart.

2802,7.0,"Born in 1992, I was the PERFECT age to check out the first installment of George Lucas' prequel trilogy! I was already a mega STAR WARS fan after watching, rewatching the original trilogy, so going to see THE PHANTOM MENACE in theaters at age 7, was the absolute dream! I still look back fondly on TPM, even with the issues it has. It does tend to drag a bit and Jake Lloyd's performance does leave a lot to be desired. But, I still love it! The finale is so impressive in so many ways! The 'Duel of the Fates' theme playing over the entirety it is pure perfection and c'mon...freaking Darth Maul! All-in-all, I have fun revisiting TPM, even if it isn't the strongest in the franchise. May the Force continue to be with the first of the prequel trilogy!",1
2803,3.0,"i think that the first 3 movies (4,5,6) are far better in most ways. this movie had better effects but thats just about it. when you watch the these you really get into character. you feel sad at the sad parts and feel exited at the battle scenes. but in this i guess the ending is kinda cool but it didn't grab my attention. so really Lucas made his worst movie so far with this one. this movie has three good things. humorous death scenes good effects and a OK ending. so i give this movie a three.now you may say well it explains a lot! your wrong. if you go back and watch the other ones you will see everything hidden! so go back or you are not a true star wars fan!",1
2804,3.0,"A lot of people are defending this movie way too much for some reason? There's a reason a majority of people don't like the film. Tbh I feel like some of those old star wars movies are overrated and their problems are excused because they're old and people's nostalgia, and just because it got some hype doesn't excuse it either. Its just a meh movie, you can watch if youre looking for a few backstory things, but imo its not above a 5, and its honestly crazy how ppl are out here giving it 10s and 9s.",0
2805,,"This movie isn't nearly as bad as people say it is.  Yes, - Jar Jar is annoying- but so what.  The good elements of the film out-weigh out the bad. The heavy emphasis on the Jedi/Sith is really interesting.  Breathtaking lightsaber duels.  Looking forward to Attack of the Clones.",0
2806,,"Of course, of all the Star Wars films to put on DVD, I'd least like to see ""The Phantom Menace.""  I'm personally dying to see ""Empire Strikes Back"" in all its digital glory, but from what I've heard, we've got to wait 4 more years for that.  As for the ""Episode One"" DVD I have to say the packaging is impressive.  And the visual and sound effects are simply state of the art. Unfortunately, the movie still stinks.  It is a horrible, horrible film. The dialogue is atrocious, the acting stiff and lifeless and the editing annoyingly overkill.",0
2807,,"This movie appeals visually, but the plot, story and dialogue can drive you crazy with its predictability and contrived cliches.  The fact that Lucas included the universally hated Jar Jar Binks, and stubbornly includes him in Episode 2 just sums up how nonsensical this movie is.",0
2808,6.0,"I don't know what George Lucas was thinking... The first three were amazing. This movie was not very good at all. First of all, Jar Jar is just the most horrible character to ever hit the screen in cinematic history. I mean, George Lucas wanted to get the kids watching?!?!? The kids don't even know what Star Wars is!!! See, he didn't focus on what the Star Wars fans would want. I mean from the very beginning I knew... This movie is going to be bad. Once Jar Jar hit the screen I knew this movie was going down the crapper. The only scene I liked was the big lightsaber duel (the one that cause Qui-Gons death). Ray Park is very talented and it was very entertaining. However, the part where litle Anakin Skywalker is piloting the Naboo starfighter was just corny and terrible. I just bowed my head in shame when I saw him wearing that huge helmet and pair of goggles... All in all I give this movie 4/10 because it ruined my belief in Star Wars...",0
2809,,"In the vacation time between ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" George Lucas managed to come up with two very novel ideas: A pod race and a double-edged light saber.  The pod race and the light saber battle are pure magic.  But Lucas seems almost indifferent to the rest of the film.  Because of this, the film is only sporadically exhilarating.  You'll probably like some parts and dislike others, depending upon your own cinematic tastes and preferences.",1
2810,1.0,"Yesterday for the first time since 10 years I tried to watch Phantom Menace and again I turned off my DVD with disgust. Clearly this is one of the movies that haven't passed the test of time - the prequels, and that one in particular, are a giant kitsch and once you start looking beyond giant layers of CGI you shake your head in sad contempt. Phantom Menace fails both as a movie - part of the defined art - and as an addition to Star Wars Universe.",0
2811,,Without a doubt the new additions to the Star Wars saga are the biggest load of trash ever made. Sterile characters and actors accompanied by mediocre effects which doesn't say much compared to the breakthrough Lucas made with the original star wars. Lacks life and can barely be watched. A Shameful prequel to three great films.,0
2812,,"First, let me say I'm a ""Star Wars"" fan.  I still remember  being 11 years old and watching the original film.  I don't think I've ever had more ""fun"" watching a movie.  It was simply a great film.  Years later,  I've seen the movie countless times, and whenever it comes on, or even, if it happens to be showing in department store, I find myself drawn to watch it, though I can quote the dialog and know virtually every detail of the scene.  And that's not because I'm the typical Star Wars geek (though I likely was in my youth), it's just a good, compelling film.  I never get tired of seeing it.",1
2813,,"""A long time ago in a galaxy far far away""...",0
2814,7.0,"It had been 14 years since Return of the Jedi hit the big screen, one day you hear Star Wars is coming back in the form of a prequel trilogy which will be directed by the guy who made the original Star Wars, George Lucas. The globe was in a frenzy once you saw the trailer, wow a NEW Star Wars movie! With such fond memories of the originals you anticipate this movie more than your own Birthday! Then once you bought a ticket, grabbed some sweets and sat down into that dark theater, your dream had come true. Then the movie had finished and you walked out of your local theater, trying to think about what you just saw, and we can tell you one thing.... it wasn't Star Wars! The film isn't that bad itself but it just doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie! It crushed the hopes of millions of geeks and just plain movie-goers over the world, with characters like little Anakin and Jar Jar Binks, you questioned your own judgment, and those two flaws (Jar Jar & Little Ani) alone serve the film a major problem, but we'll try delve even deeper into what ruined this film, or who ruined it (George Lucas). This film suffers from a very bad script, some dialog is OK but some really isn't. The scenes at Coruscant with all those parliament meetings and talks bore the hell out of you! With such big stars like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson, why didn't the script utilize them!? Jar Jar Binks is supposed to be comic relief for the kids but this saga really doesn't know what audience it's aiming for, sometimes there's funny scenes even adults and children like but then bring that up that when you see Anakin Skywalker's cut-in-half burning body at the end of Revenge of the Sith. But before we go any further let's address some of the good things about the film: The Pod Race, Darth Maul, The Lightsaber Duel and the opening scene where Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi battle the droids. That's about it, and Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi is perfect, but he spends most of the film in a ship on Tatooine just talking, yeah... This is how that masterful Jedi Guardian in A New Hope started out! Now we come to Jar Jar Binks and Little Anakin Skywalker. Jar Jar is just really annoying, he makes tasteless jokes throughout the whole film, why he's even in most of the film is beyond us! Why did George even put him here, did he seriously think the audience would find this character funny, well maybe for three year-old's but that's it! If you watch the movie over the years you'll find you just get used to him and can let him pass but little Anakin is where things get serious. The whole point of this prequel trilogy is to show how Anakin Skywalker transforms into Darth Vader, and this is how it began........ One of cinemas most iconic villains begins off as a poorly acted character who says such lines as ""yippee"". As a kid I imagined him to be lean and blunt, but still a good kid deep down. It's hard to get interested in the movie when you see this kids (Jake Lloyd's) acting, you can tell its unrealistic, taking you out of the moment. The plot's also got a few errors in it, did Darth Sidious want the Jedi to be killed at the beginning or not? If he's been planning his eventual victory at the end of Revenge of the Sith since this movie, why would he want Obi Wan or Qui Gonn dead if they're the key element to finding Anakin Skywalker. Or did he know that they'd survive the separatists' droid attack, who knows..! Talk about lazy directing, George Lucas wasn't even thinking when he wrote the script, now we don't think he did it for merchandising purposes, we truly believe he did it because he loved his franchise. But the writing is so bad in this one, Viceroy Gunray orders his droids to ""destroy what's left of them"" regarding Qui Gonn and Obi Wan at the start of the film, after injecting a toxic gas into their room. By destroying what was left of the Jedi did he mean for the battle droids to shoot their corpses!? It's just a pointless error that could have been removed. One more good thing about the film are in fact the battle droids, their subtle humor and design makes us like them more than Clone Troopers. Anyway, here is EMC's review on chronologically the first in The Star Wars saga. It's OK but just fails in a lot of areas, like the discovery of Anakin and how it didn't have a main character which was supposed to be Obi Wan Kenobi. George's stunning visuals in the film prove that he adds more style than substance. There's all these neat action scenes but it means nothing if we're not invested in the actual film. Out of the six EPIC films, this one is for sure the weakest....",0
2815,5.0,"With some redeeming qualities and an overall solid introduction to the saga, The Phantom Menace is watchable, but it is a chore doing so.",1
2816,1.0,"Given that the Star Wars trilogy is the central, organizing story of my generation, I and the many millions of hungry fans have every reason to expect a more heartfelt effort than ""Phantom Menace"".",0
2817,5.0,"Born 2 years before this movie was released, I have my perspective on the Phantom Menace. Regardless of arguably being a relatively incoherent film, this is one of my earliest films. Some of my earliest childhood memories surround my viewings on the Phantom Menace on VHS.",1
2818,6.0,"The movie definitely did not live up to its hype.  But even more it did not have the same feeling, the same emotion as the three movies that preceded it.  I wanted a good story and good characters that I could feel something for, and got little or none of that.  The entire film seemed aimed directly at kids under twelve, and was designed to dazzle them with as many special effects as could be crammed into 130-some odd minutes.  I found the overabundance of computer generated graphics and characters to be, in the end, distracting and a bit annoying.",0
2819,7.0,*No spoilers below. I swear*,0
2820,,"The plot is awesome, but I don't know about those special effects.  I mean, knowing what we know about it all being fake, how can you not percive everything as a bluscreen with computer images in front of it.  It really detracts from the movie I think, but then again.... That's just my opinion.",1
2821,7.0,"Ok, this is a good movie worth seeing, but it surely is not original. Obviously, Lucas wanted to play it safe and satisfy the fans by giving them modified versions of scenes they already knew and love, but this is, of course, not what we want. Some examples:",0
2822,4.0,This was a disappointment.  There was far less imagination after a decade to plan than Lucas demonstrated in the few years between the first three movies.,0
2823,8.0,I walked into the theatre fairly unsure of what to expect. I'd heard so many horrible things from the critics and now I was to see it for myself.,1
2824,,"I think the root of much of the problems with TPM is not a distorted view of the originals.  It comes down to a lack of chemistry between the characters. Yes the original Star Wars had its share of faults, but it had an electric chemistry between the three leads that is undeniable.  And that chemistry is undeniably lacking in this new movie.  All the great effects, all the strange revelations, and all the hype can't make up for this lack.",1
2825,,"There are three things wrong with the Phantom Menace: Jar, Jar, Binks. There, I've said it.",0
2826,2.0,"This movie was pathetic compared to the original three.  The ideas are there, they are simply not fleshed out and used the way they should be.  I think Lucas did better when he had an uncertain studio making sure that he drafted and redrafted the script.",0
2827,10.0,"I expected this movie to get a lot of flack because it was really over hyped, and when the critics came out with their reviews I wasn't too shocked.  This movie was much more exciting than the previous ones and while excitement isn't the only important ingredient in a film, it's great to be on the edge of your seat for a large portion of the movie.  While the movie lacked a han solo like character, I don't feel this movie needed one. Overall I found this new installment an excellent addition to an already amazing series.  The fight scenes with Maul were the highlight of the film for me, and good performances by Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman are only two of many worthy efforts. There really is too much to say about the film's special effects, score, acting, etc... so I'll just tell everyone to go see it and experience.",1
2828,9.0,"Like the ""original"" Star Wars film, which we should probably be referring to as ""A New Hope"" these days, The Phantom Menace is the first of a trilogy. Unlike Episode IV, however, Episode I does not work particularly well as a stand-alone movie. When George Lucas first made Star Wars, he was not at all sure that he could ever make The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. For the original release, the beginning ""scroll-off"" letters did not say ""Episode IV."" This was later added after Star Wars became a success and the story could be told in its complete form.",1
2829,,"The Phantom Menace is what the fans of the trilogy have wanted for a very long time. Lucas did a great job with his casting, especially for Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor.  If I were Lucas I'd have put in more Kenobi but I would like to see McGregor in Episode 2. I personally liked Jar-Jar, most people just don't understand because they do not know how to listen. This is as good as I expected.",1
2830,8.0,"After seeing it I could understand why some critics didn't like it.  The first half of the movie is rather jumbled, and you never really get a feel for some of the characters.  The Gungan accents are usually irritating and indecipherable (though the Trade Federation aliens and Watto's accents are cool and entertaining).  Worse, Anakin Skywalker is a really annoying kid (except when he's hitting on Natalie Portman).",0
2831,3.0,"I have already added my comment to the currently 1670. But, I thought after reading some of the other comments on the movie I decided to add yet another one. ",1
2832,3.0,"In general I liked the new addition to the series of Star Wars movies. I think it some awsome scenes, special effects, and I think Mr. Lucas has quite succeeded in getting some environmental shots just right.",1
2833,,"Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film but I have one major problem with it.  I personally felt that this movie was too futuristic compared to the original trilogy.  This complaint may seem strange to some but c'mon this movie is supposed to be a prequel, not to mention that it happened ""A long time ago.......""  I just couldn't help but feel I was watching a movie taking place in the year 2520!  Granted it was visually stunning but it just didn't feel like a Star Wars movie.",0
2834,,"I must say I attended the film with much anticipation. Every thing was going along fine, the Jedi were battle ready with Samurai like intensity, the Force was flowing, and Darth Sidious was speaking in his familiar nasty rasp embracing the Dark Side. I found Carrie Fisher has nothing on the lovely Natalie Portman (every moment with her on the screen was absolutely wondrous). Getting used to a pint sized Darth-Vader-To-Be was a stretch, but I overcame even that.  All was right with the world. Enter Jar Jar Binks.  I must draw the line at Jar Jar.  This insipid garbage absolutely ruined the movie.  I don't care if Lucas was aiming at the kiddy demographic, and if he was, shame on him.  A plague on him actually.",0
2835,10.0,"George Lucas has done it again. Set thirty years before the events of the original trilogy, THE PHANTOM MENACE gives us a glimpse at the golden age of the Republic before the 'dark times'. The writing, the direction, the SFX, and the triumphant music of John Williams all blend together into one incredible movie that will be watched over and over by fans and non-fans alike. I mean, who didn't get chills when the STAR WARS title appeared and went backwards and the traditional title scroll appeared? This is a STAR WARS movie in every sense of the word. We have good guys, bad guys, aliens, spaceships, robots, and crazy alien sidekicks. This is what we grew up on, it's all here, but expanded upon and given a new epic feel. I feel sorry for those bashers who say this movie has no plot, you couldn't be more wrong. The story in THE PHANTOM MENACE is more complex than the ones in the original trilogy, it not only gives more depth to the saga overall, but it starts the ball rolling for Episodes 2 & 3. THE PHANTOM MENACE is an excellent first chapter in Lucas's sci-fi saga. I can't wait to get into Chapter 2!",1
2836,10.0,"In 1976, before George Lucas, had pitched his original Star Wars script to 20th Century Fox, he had a script in his hand which started out, ""This is the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of the Opuchi who was related to us by C.J. Thape, padawaan learner for the famed Jedi..""  Lucas has gone back to the roots of his original ""Dune""-inspired story which every true Star Wars fan knows about. Episode One is a promise kept to his fans. The names Mace Windu, Bail Antilles (Organa?), Whills (as in Journal of the), Correlia (Han Solo's home world famed for its huge starships), Kessel (famous for spice mines and a space race) have all been part of the background universe of Star Wars ever since the first movie came out in 1977. Now we are gradually seeing this universe come to life. That alone is worth the price of ticket. What a treat!  Episode One more than delivers. People have complained about the characters, but if you look at the entire saga as one story, then Episode One makes perfect sense. Lucas has set up Anakin's turn to the Dark Side of the Force with several key scenes in this new movie; it's already clear that familial ties are the key to this saga. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu don't get much screen time in this movie, but you can bet your asteroids they'll be back in full Force in Episode Two. Viva George Lucas! Viva Star Wars!",1
2837,9.0,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, I was afraid it would not live up to the billing, it did and far surpassed it.  This film is one of the most technologically advanced films ever and backs up the eye dazzling special effects with a story line that leaves casual viewers thinking for days and Star Wars fans salivating for the the next two installments in 2002 and 2005.  Lucas does an outstanding job with the story and lets you in on information that only makes the original trilogy (Star Wars, Empire and Jedi) that much better.  I can not wait for Episode II, and recommend this film to any one of any age.",1
2838,10.0,"Wow, Episode I is without a doubt the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long while. All I can suggest is not to get hung up by all of the negative reviews out there condemning it for its poor script, that Lucas has lost some of his ""magical touch,"" etc. Go out to see it to have fun and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. For extra enjoyment, dress up as the Star Wars character of your choice and act like an obsessive maniac at the theater, wielding your lightsaber like a certified Jedi knight. People may look at you funny, but you'll have a blast (I, of course, would never commit such an act, er...). Seriously, Star Wars has always been a great series, and I certainly feel that Lucas has successfully continued that trend through Episode I. Elitists out there will knock it for it's occasionally cheery atmosphere, and compare it unfavorably to the darker Empire Strikes Back. But you know what? I don't care. As long as each Episode continues in the same vein as its predecessors as fascinating, unbelievable tales, then I'll be happy -- which is why I'm so looking forward to Episodes II and III. Congrats to Mr. Lucas for coming up with another great film.",1
2839,9.0,"First of all, how much fun is this movie?  Amazing!  So intense, so visually exciting, so encompassing!  So ends my 16 year wait. I need to say that before I saw the film, I read the reviews which almost unanimously slammed the movie.  Actually, all the reviews looked like they'd been done by the same critic, but that's another matter.  The critics are not wrong.  They just weren't really watching the movie.  They pretended to look for deep meaning in vain, yet missed all of the subtle satire and double meanings hidden within the movie. To be honest, I wasn't looking for the greatest movie of all time.  I just wanted to see a new Star Wars movie.  And Phantom Menace delivered.  And this episode works so well in conjunction with the other films.  If you know the story for episodes 4-6, Phantom Menace takes on a whole different tone. You know who Palpatine is.  You know who Darth Sidious is.  And you know who Anakin is. That's it - Just go see it - whether or not you've seen the others. This movie can and will stand on its own.  In 20 years, the next generation may have grown up watching episode 1 first and Return of the Jedi 6th.  One word of advice - don't operate a car within a half hour of seing this film!",1
2840,10.0,"I went in with low expectations and I left in complete awe and amazement. This is definitely the movie of the decade. The effects were astounding and the computer generated images were ""appropriate"", unlike those in The Special Editions. The Phantom Menace is great and it will blow Titanic out the water (again).",1
2841,8.0,"As someone who saw Star Wars: A New Hope when it opened in 1977, I have to say that I rather enjoyed this latest installment to the Star Wars films. In my humble opinion, it did live up to the hype.  I found the special effects to be the best that I have ever seen on film.  Is there nothing that cannot now be done on film!?! The only real criticism though, was that I found myself sitting there going, ""okay, now they blow the death star...no that's the droid control ship, or now it's time for the throne room scene...scrap that, it's a victory parade."" Regardless, my wife and I greatly enjoyed ourselves and have decided to see it at least one more time.  After all we're not 16 anymore! Oh one other thing, where was Han......?",0
2842,10.0,"Listen people,everyone is a critic,sure you can pick at this film and find many flaws.  What film is ever perfect, ask yourself after you have seen this movie, was it worth watching. We've all had 16 years to wonder if George Lucas was ever going to finish what he had started with Star Wars,and now here it is. I thought it was magical simply because it was like going back in time when I was 11 years old and saw the film for the first time in 77.  The familiar soundtrack blasting at the beginning of the movie with the scrolling words was a time warp.  My two young boys loved every minute of it as did I.  To all the professional critics out there, get a life.  I still remember the reviews that came out about the first three films, So why should this film be any different.  They hate success, which is what this new edition will be.  The only thing I hate is having to wait three years for the next installment.  I will see this film many times to make the waiting less painful.  You will enjoy this movie, Unless you hate sfx movies and in that case you were never a fan anyways so stay home.",1
2843,,"I was a little nervous about the thrashing this movie had gotten, but was pleasantly surprised when I saw it for myself.  The plot was decent enough, and the special effects were, as expected, stunning.  My main criticism, though, would be of the incredibly annoying character Jar Jar.  I understand Lucas' desire to insert some comedic relief, but he was given too many pratfalls and ""getting into trouble"" scenes.  The voice is incredibly annoying, and I can't picture anyone actually approving it.  However, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson were excellent, and most importantly, the film felt like Star Wars.",0
2844,3.0,"I was hoping for a movie as good as the first 3 ones were. Sure, I got fantastic visuals... but scenario full of inconsistencies (remember when Ben tells Luke that he will go to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi master who tought him? well... Lucas now thinks that the Jedi master who taught Ben is now Qui-Gon Jinn... why this turn around)... and full of unneeded add-ons... Whe de medicloreans... did Lucas feel afraid of the religous lobbies that he had to make the Force a physical/biological phenomenon rather than a mystical one? I won't go into the bad acting of Jake Loyd or the cliches of the various non humans we meet... or of the pathetic Jar Jar, or the almost inexistent Darth Maul... And... did anyone actually feel a menace somewhere?",0
2845,3.0,"Visually stunning, yet at the same time the most over-hyped movie I have ever seen. None of the characters have personality (save Darth Maul and Obi-Won every once in a while) and I found myself rooting for Darth Maul to win just so he'd be on the screen longer.  Overlong, with some of the worst acting  and characters (Jar Jar Bincs deserves Oscar for most annoying character ever. Felt like I was watching a rip off of ""Men In Black"" most of the time, with aliens coming into the picture just for cheap laughs, something Lucas would never have done in the original Trilogy.  For any TRUE Star Wars fan, this movie was a disgrace to the originals.",0
2846,,"If you quieten your mind you can hear your minichlorines chanting ""oh what a terrible movie"", if you focus really hard you can see that there actually was no movie - there certainly was no plot or dialog.",0
2847,7.0,"It is nearly impossible to talk about this movie adequately without divulging plot details.  Therefore, this discussion may be somewhat cryptic.",0
2848,10.0,"I heard from some friends that the movie wasn't that good and there was too much hype, so I walked into the theater already critical, but I still loved it. It was different enough from the others to be original, but there was no doubt that it was a part of the Star Wars saga with its style and numerous subtle connections to episodes 4, 5, and 6. I liked how some scenes were shot like they were in the other movies. The special effects mixed perfectly into the movie without taking away from the story.  If you are considering watching the film, see it.",1
2849,9.0,"George Lucas does it again. Star Wars episode one: The Phantom Menace is the movie of the summer of 1999 for many reasons, one it had all the action that would compose of a great movie yet the movie had a multi-dimensional plot that would appeal to people at most age levels. If you do not compare it to the other Star Wars movies, it was a grand portrayal of the Jedi warrior Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi's quest to defend the planet Naboo from the evil trade federation, with a pit stop along the way. The movie has extremely refined special effects and an incredible score and music thanks to John Williams as always. But as always the only fault of this movie is that it resembled episode four(from 1976) and many of the scenes resembled scenes from the other movies. That may be a slight fault of the movie but the plot line was typical of star wars, a good versus evil battle with the ideals of the Jedi Force underlying the movie. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy a light action movie and are very keen on science fiction although a love of science fiction is not necessary. I would not recommend this movie to people who look to a movie as an experience that will make a new statement, or a movie that will present a new experience in film viewing. Although this movie does not seem to be very original, Lucas still tells a good story and gives a great history on the Star Wars trilogy episodes 4,5,and 6, and what is more important, a movie that tells a new original story or a movie that keeps you entertained. I believe in the latter therefore I believe that this movie is going to be one of the best movies of the year and therefore is deserved of the hype.",1
2850,10.0,"After all the hype, all the waiting, and all the ""oh, crap, Jar Jar Binks is just here to draw the Ewok-fan vote,"" all I can say is this film was great. It was brilliant.  I couldn't get enough of it.  Jar Jar was the only bit I thought could have been better, and my only change would have been to make him more competent, less slapsticky.  This is truly a fine Star Wars film, ranking higher than Return of the Jedi, but not quite up to Empire (my personal favorite)... This film was just so well put together, all the nuances and details were perfectly done... Can't say much more without spoilers, but I feel the wait was worth it, and am starving for more.",1
2851,9.0,"Wow! What sound! Wow! What Computer-aided-Animations! Gosh! What a bad, bad, bad story! I only can describe it with the words of young Anakin: ""Ooops"". For me there is too much ""Ooops"" in the story. The characters are not painted well and I don't like this ""Star Trek""-like 2 Minute end. To George Lucas: Less is sometimes more!",0
2852,3.0,"Let me start by saying I am a HUGE Star Wars fan. I grew up with it and the original trilogy still remains among my favorite movies of all time. So, the question is, what did I think of Episode One: The Phantom Menace? Sadly, the answer is ""not much"".",0
2853,,I suppose any comment/review would be incomplete without at least acknowledging the comments that have come before mine regarding TPM.,0
2854,,"By now, I would think that most of you who want to see TPM have...but for those of you who haven't, let me assure you that it is indeed a stirring addition to the Star Wars mythos.  What many critics have called a ""lack of involvement"" in the story really has very little to do with the film; Episode I is not meant to be consumed purely by itself.  Unlike the original trilogy, which Lucas was constantly afraid he would be unable to finish while making the first one, this first chapter is merely a staging point for the events to follow in Episodes II and III, as well as being an enhancement to the original saga.  Those critics that claim a ""lack of involvement"" are merely showing just how far the film's scope and purpose went above their heads.  Enjoy the film as part of the greater saga, and all the wonderful hidden intricacies of the Lucasfilm universe will be laid out for you in spectacular fashion.",0
2855,2.0,"As usual, the sequel of a great series of films miserably failed to impress me: I admit that the special effects are marvellous and very convincing, but apart from that, nah, forget about the film, it's a waste of great actors like Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson and Liam Neeson. The dialogues vary between bad soap-opera quality and unbelievably dumb, and the Gungan, the flap-eared creature that should be funny just gets on your nerves. Let's hope the next one will be a lot better.",0
2856,8.0,"George Lucas takes a new brand of Star wars and uses it to shove two fingers up at the critics. The film is superb, breathtaking scenery, an interesting storyline and best of all, a red and black dude with a double sided lightsabre!!! Darth Maul almost surpasses Vader as the best baddie of all time and its a pity there isn't more of him. McGregor is brilliant in a difficult role and you will never see a better action sequence than the pod racing. If you don't like this film, you should be kept in a small room with padded walls. ROLL ON EPISODE TWO!!!!",1
2857,4.0,Poorly made movie. Using computer gimmiks as seen in previews. Not as good as original nor any follow ups. Plot is far fetched and somewhat difficult to follow. Not cracked up to hype.,0
2858,9.0,"When I read the critics reviews for this movie, most of them said there was not enough plot, and the actors had nothing to do. I actually think there may have been a little too much plot. Most films, television series, books, etc. have one main plot, and other subplots spinning around it. The Phantom Menace has two distinctly different yet equally important main plots. Because equal time is spent evolving these two major plots, they end up taking away from each other, and it becomes distracting.  However, when I viewed the film the second time I was able to follow the plot developments and could spend time enjoying the amazing special effects and martial arts sequences, and didn't have to struggle to fully understand both plots. The film is truly stunning, and once you fully understand what is happening, the story line is well developed as well. It's almost as if there is too much happening all at once for you to grasp it all in one viewing.  The acting was stronger in some places than others. Liam Neeson is a terrific actor, and doesn't lose much in this role. Ewan McGregor, although a strong young actor in his own right, seems wasted in this film, as he is used almost exclusively as Neeson's sidekick.  Jake Lloyd, who plays a young Anakin Skywalker is rather annoying. He speaks in a whiney voice, although this bothered me only until I remembered Mark Hammil's whiny voice in the original trilogy. Pernillia August delivers an excellent supporting role as Anakin's mother, which is probably the best acted in the whole film, perhaps Oscar worthy. In a Star Wars scale of film, I'd rate it below ""Empire Strikes Back"" but above ""A New Hope"" and ""Return of the Jedi"".  If you saw it once, and didn't think it was all that great, give it another chance. I promise you, you'll enjoy it more the second time around.  Rating: 8/10",1
2859,8.0,"TPM does not disappoint. It's totally awesome - the acting was fine, the plot was good and the script was okay. The visual effects were amazing and the light saber duels were the best ever in Star Wars. I didn't find Jar Jar Binks irritating at all too.",1
2860,5.0,"The Phantom Menace blows.  Cartoonish and gangly, this latest endeavor from The Lucas Emporium, Inc. seemed to think it was such a sparkling epic that it could easily afford to overlook such passé film staples as plot, acting, and dialogue, none of which make an appearance anywhere in the movie.  Too dependent on the ""cuteness"" of the omnipresently and incomprehensibly irksome Jar Jar Binks (oh, but what a great action figure he'll make!), the visual spectacle of its overworked digital landscapes (like something from the pages of a ""Where's Waldo"" book), and the dubious believability of the stone-faced, deadpan performance of Natalie Portman as Queen Abidala (did these actors get to create their own accents?), the movie falls limply and quite disappointingly short of its cult-classic predecessors.",0
2861,5.0,"This is a mixture between Power Rangers, A Bug's Life, the Little Mermaid and StarShip Troopers.  It just happens to have some Star Wars overtones. If it did not have a Star Wars billing, this thing wouldn't crack the 50mil mark.  Disappointed is an understatement.  Why the necessity for an entire clan of computer generated underwater yahoos and their pathetic sub-plot? Is merchandising that important.  Lucas has two more films to clean this debacle up...God speed.",0
2862,3.0,"This pre Star Wars episode was less than anticipated.  It was obvious that the movie was based on the back story to the Star Wars saga.  Even with the minimal plot, the movie could have been more entertaining if the actors had been allowed more screen time. As it is, the movie is filled with scene after scene of special effects and artificial characters. Great if you are interested in seeing how far the field of FX has advanced but rather boring if your looking for a good story.",0

The new technology and the long wait (16 years) since the last movie has given TPM a new feel and texture, yet retains some of the same qualities as the original movies. The Phantom Menace is often a bit too fast-paced and childish, but it overcomes these minor problems with it's visually appealing wonders and the questions it raises, such as the reasons behind Anakin's descent into the Dark Side. Decide for yourself, but I found The Phantom Menace to be far better than what the critics had to say about it. This is a quality motion picture.",1

2868,7.0,"After 16 years of waiting, I must admit (and I don't like to) that I was disappointed. But I think my expectations were not only too high, but my idea of what the movie was like was far different than what it turned out to be.",0
2869,9.0,A wonderful roller-coaster ride of a film.  The CG effects earn an 11. Leaves you waiting for the next movie.  The only problem is the obvious shoe-horning of C-3PO into the movie.

2870,9.0,"The new Star Wars is better than what the critics have been saying - The movie doesn't quite match the hype, but could any movie? And no, it's not the best Star Wars, but it's the best movie I've seen for ages.",1
2871,,"Many people have taken exception to the fact that this film is lighter and more kid-oriented than the first three. Jar Jar Binks IS an irritation, yes... But, don't forget: Four through Six were primarilly a coming-of-age story regarding what were basically teenage feelings about growing up. Is it a coincidence that when Luke finally comes into his own as a Jedi that the cute and childlike Ewoks enter the picture. Shades of parenting, perhaps?",1
2872,9.0,"Going into The Phantom Menace last night I had ignored all the movie critics. The way I looked at it, I (among with millions of other people) didn't agree with them 20 years ago so what made me expect I was going to agree with them now.",1
2873,,"I went into this movie with a blank mind, trying not to think about all the negative reviews.  A kid's movie?  Oh puleeeeeease!  This has got to be the deepest episode in the Star Wars saga.  It was amazing.  The FX were far and away the best I've ever seen.  And they blended seamlessly in with the live action shots.  Darth Maul was mesmerizing.  All the actors gave good, solid performances.  Especially Liam Neeson.  Ewan McGregor did a lot better than I thought he would.  He captured the essence of Alec Guiness perfectly. Jake Loyd's performance was not ""wooden"" as it had been speculated, he acted the way he was supposed to...... like a typical nine year old kid.  Natalie Portman did a fine job.  The acting was like it was in the original trilogy, but who cares?  The acting isn't what makes Star Wars great.  The movie went by very fast but left so many unanswered questions like, how was Anakin conceived?  What was his mother hiding?  Who is Darth Sideous?  All in all, this is an incredible achievement. And although it has a different feel than the other films, it fits in nicely.  Can't wait for Ep.2!",1
2874,8.0,"No movie is perfect, no matter how bad we want it to be. Phantom Menace is a great film, entertaining, dazzling, and it satisfies the withdrawal cravings SW fans have been having for 16 years. But I wouldn't be being honest if I didn't state that I think the character developement, and thus character empathy level, was lacking in this film. One explanation is that this film has to set up the entire series through to Jedi, but even so there's always room for character developement. I didn't feel like I knew any of the characters, whereas in A New Hope I instantly felt I knew ALL the characters, and therefore was invested with a strong emotional connection with the story. But lets face it, SW fans don't want to see Phantom Menace for in depth characterization, they want to be taken to a galaxy far far away. And therefore Menace delivers what it promises, or what it owes to fans, and so is a success in it's mission. Now, if we could only have seen more of Darth Maul! He stole every scene he was in. I give it an 8 overall.",1
2875,4.0,"After watching The Phantom Menace (in a very empty theater) I have devised my own theory that I think explains most of the movie's strengths (few) and weaknesses (many). It has been 22 years since Lucas promised the world a nine-part space saga. With the release of the new movie, he modified that to six-part, saying that he never really intended to make a third, post grown-up-Luke trilogy. But seeing Phantom makes me think he didn't really have a second trilogy either. The movie is paper thin, filled with much to do about nothing.",0
2876,8.0,"Overall ""The Phantom Menace"" was a good movie.  It was however disappointing in the manner that the movie seemed, at times, like a sci-fi soap opera.  There were too many things going on that was trying to be shown that gave it this style.  It is understandable that this was setting up the remainder of the series.  It seems that it could have been done in a way that would have given more of a smooth flow to the story line.",0
2877,1.0,"I grew up in the era of the first three and though Return of the Jedi was very flawed I love watching those first three. I was excited to see this movie.

It had so few redeeming qualities and none that constitute mention.",0

2881,10.0,"At last the movie arrived Germany! I was so curious about this movie, because i heard so many bad critics and i just couldn't believe them. Now, finally, I had the chance of figure it out for myself, and.... I don't know what's wrong with all the people! I was lucky to see the midnight-premier of ""The phantom menace"" and I loved it from the beginning. I mean, hey: IT IS STAR WARS! And in my opinion, this movie has the same magic as its prequels ( or sequels). The lightsaber duels are unbelievable fast and very good choreographed, the pod-race was simply stunning as all the other special effects. Alright, but I have to admit, that the movie had some weak points which the first three movies didn't have. But they're no serious weaknesses. I mean, all the fuzz about Jar Jar Binks... He's not that bad, actually, I kinda liked him. Funny guy.",0
2882,,"First off, let it be known I am an incredible fan of Star Wars. I don't let it dominate my life, but I absolutely love the aspect of the story that brings us back to childhood, while having such adult overtones to be compelling in a mature setting (The Emperor and his crusade against aliens for example, reminds you of Hitler, no?)",1
2883,,"The real Menace is what sneaks up on you like a lurking phantom as this film unfolds. It is the realisation that this film cannot live up to all the hype it's been given. It is, none the less, at least a 9 out of 10. The movie opens strong and reveals a thrilling new display of the power of a Jedi Knight. In the fast moving first few  scenes, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn leads the apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in a fight out of an ambush aboard a Federation Vessel. The audience is warned to buckle up for the ride to come. While the high-energy isn't constant throughout the film, the visual display is. This piece DOES live up to the rumours of fascinating new worlds and vast epic cities that leave the viewer wanting just another second to take in each scene. The unfortunate part of this story is that it is preceded by 20 years of the out-of-this-world success and popularity of its sequels. No film, however great, can compete with that in 2 hours on a Wednesday evening. It does however deliver some very memorable scenes. The most talked about surely to be the Pod Race. This thrill-ride pits young Anakin, against a miry collection of native Tatooinian creatures, in a race literally for his life. The Pods, are home made contraptions (I use that term very loosely) that are basically two afterburning jet engines towing a dune buggy frame that contains more electronics than a stealth fighter. In short, this race makes Ben Hur look like a royal wedding. Episode One covers all the bases too. The comedic Jar Jar Binks, while a little corny at times for the adult crowd, is certain to be a hit with the younger set. Unfortunately they will be driving adults everywhere battty, trying to imitate his almost baby-like pidgin English.",1
2884,,"I didn't like ""Phantom Menace"" much when it first came out. I thought it was stilted and boring. But, it was ""Star Wars,"" so I felt like it was my duty to defend it.",0
2885,10.0,It is a good movie with excellent special effects. I think it is also much funnier than the other Star Wars movies. And some scenes actually made my heart race.

2886,7.0,"Like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" it gets off to a bit of a slow start, but after the pod race, everything is great!  The light saber battles are fantastic!  Excellent use of foreshadowing.

2887,10.0,"Ok, lets get one thing straight.  This is 1 of 6, the beginning of the story.  EVERY story has a beginning, middle, and an end.  In there is also a CLIMAX, if these terms are foreign to you, you have no business rating this movie.  The Climax of the movie as around 3 or 4, we have already seen 4. I'm not saying you have to like it.  But some of these comments that say ""there are no strong characters""  When was the last time you saw a movie that had a strong character buildup in the first 10 minutes, which is what this movie is.  ""Anakin was annoying""  Youre just jealous youre not in the movie.  ""It was boring, so slow, it didn't go anywhere""  Where do you want it to go?  You know the ending, YOU try to tell a story after someone has told the outcome, that is what Lucas had to do, give the man a break.  Ok, Jar Jar could be annoying, Second time I saw the movie, he grew on me. ""The Jedi's had no commanding role's""  This comment comes from people who are expecting action from ""The Terminator"" do I need to remind you people that Jedi's are mainly priests???  They are calm and content until the time is needed, then they kick butt.  . I give this movie a very strong 10",0

My 7-year old mind had never seen anything like it! So I'm inclined to be much less critical than many have been. Sure, it's got plenty of flaws - poorly developed characters, annoying alien sidekick, appalling and cloyingly cute child actor - but it's still great entertainment and candy for the eyes, ears and imagination. Lucas has 2 more prequels with which to really hit his stride - I'm confident he will. I enjoyed it immensely and will see it again.",1
2890,8.0,"My family went in with an open mind, not sure what to expect.  We were surprised that we loved it as much as we did.  Sure, the movie is not perfect, and they could have done a bit more with the characters, but we have to realize that the original characters are different people, and if we'd seen this movie first, we would have seen it through different eyes. It looked totally 'Star Wars"" and had the same George Lukas look, and that's what we love. It set us up for part 2, & 3, and those will be great.  Give these characters a chance.  It's not Fellini!

The original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi had great technology and Episode 1 is before in time so why does Episode 1 have a lot better technology. I mean most of the soldiers in Episode 1 were droids or robots, and in the original Star Wars they were men in white costumes. Anyway besides all that this movie was great. Now all I have to do is sit back and wait for the next 2.",1
2893,10.0,"First off, this movie was excellent. In no way does it deserve the bad reviews that so many people have given it.  All the acting is top notch, the special effects are the best I have ever seen, and the battle scenes are incredible. One drawback of this movie is Jar Jar Binks, he is quite annoying.  The light sabre fighting scene between Obi Wan and Qui Gon against Darth Maul is awesome.  Overall I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10, deducting 0.5 because of Jar Jar Binks. On a side note I would like to say that I think its great that George Lucas stayed with tradition at the beginning with the scrawling words and the galaxy far far away bit.",1
2894,6.0,"Ok. Fine. This film is not quite as epic or brilliant as (two of) the three films it predates, but it is still not bad as a forerunner for what will hopefully be two excellent follow-ups. George Lucas has clearly displayed the fact that he is far better suited to directing animation over real people, but the specials effects are brilliant and Lucas' vivid imagination shines through in the dazzling array of creatures, ships and devices throughout the film. There are two problems I had with this film. Jar Jar Binks, and Darth Maul. Jar Jar was an unnecessary attempt to appeal to the younger generation, who would have loved the film without him, he brings an element of immaturity to the film. Its very hard for a film to be epic when you have a stupid, unfunny character distracting you from more important things. And secondly, Darth Maul doesn't say anything cool. When Obi-Wan fought Darth Vader in the original, the battle was replete with memorable lines left, right and centre. Darth Maul never even spoke to Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan, and the battle, while spectacular, left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.",1

I went to see the movie open-minded - to be true, I repeated ""I'm gonna like this movie, I'm gonna like this movie"" to myself all the time =:) The first twenty minutes...it was a shock. The beginning was, let's just say, terrible. Neimodians sucked badly and the whole scene was pointless. And it didn't get any better after that. Gungan City scene was too short and the earth's core-stuff had nothing to do with the movie. And the rescue operation, it was TERRIBLE. R2D2 saved the day, yippee. But THEN...they arrived at Tattooine. Jake Lloyd and Pernilla August were perfect in their roles. Suddenly, the movie appeared to be entertaining and smart. Podrace was the best scene in the whole movie, and of course Anakin had to win - ""your father was a great pilot when I first met him"", remember...? Coruscant was absolutely fabulous and mindbending. I mean, it was all computer-generated and looked SO real. The galactic senate scene was realistic and I could see frustration and despair in Amidala's and Palpatine's eyes. Jedi Council couldn't have been better, I could almost FEEL members of the council worried because they sense something in Anakin... Okay, I admit it, when Amidala and Boss Nass signed a treaty with this ""I'm Amidala..."", ""No, I'M queen Amidala!"" stuff was horrible. But can't complain. Gungan battle scene was truly amazing and Jar Jar Binks funny as hell. The space battle could have been better Jedi knights vs. Darth Maul, now THAT was something. The palace battle wasn't so good, twelve guys against droidekas, battle droids and a friggin' army? No way...",0
2899,5.0,"I'll put it short and sweet, the latter of which is the main problem of Phantom Menace:  Shut up.  If I was there during the making of the film, that's all I would have been thinking.  Shut up, shut up, how can I just shut up?  I believe a strong sense of balance is needed in films, and while expositionary scenes and eye candy are completely tolerated by film-goers, they occur far too often in Phantom Menace, resulting in myself not caring for the main characters, save what I had already felt in episodes IV, V, and VI. I love you George, we all do, but all I, and millions of other fans, are asking is that in the next film, which I will see in a heartbeat, trust the actors.  Trust the hundreds of facial muscles.

Keep looking, and you should find it, and when you do...you'll be like .... WHOAAA.

The actors seem to merely be mouthing their lines. Moreover, as much as I thought it was frustrated former English majors-now critics who moaned about lack of character development, there really has to be some development, or there is no story.  You have to care at least a little to be moved when a character dies.

Episode 1 is an action packed movie with a good story and nicely worked characters. At least I thought it was, any critic would probably not say it is as good as all this. It has spectacular effects that made awesome sequences like the pod race and the ending duel which to me was the best part of the film {wasn't it everybody's!} And offers things we have not seen much of in the other movies like the Sith and more than one Jedi which have been highly trained.",1

If you don't dwell too much on him, you'll be fine. Everyone will complain about Darth Maul, and they will have a very valid point.  Call it the Boba Fett syndrome;  when a character of mass appeal receives too little screen time.  I enjoyed Episode I, but as with any prequel you know who will survive, thus taking away some suspense (I believe the root of the whole problem). Liam Neeson really had that leader quality down and did a really good job, but you can thank Ray Park (Darth Maul) for the best lightsaber play you are likely to every see. Unfortunately, it is impossible not to have hype around such an anticipated movie, I just wish the media would have cooled it on the spoilers.

So Four years later, after countless trips to Star Wars websites, countless viewing of the Original Trilogy, a night in line for tickets and the purchasing of various action figures I can say with a big smile ""It was worth it!""",1
2911,10.0,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace succeeds in so many areas that it makes up for the place in where it falters.  Let us first deal with the scenery. Contrary to what critics have said, the costume design and use of special effects are glorious and do not detract one inch from great acting performances given by all of the main cast members.  In fact, I felt as a whole the acting clearly outmatched the original movie.  The original musical score by John Williams was excellent and carried along the story very effectively.",1
2912,7.0,"The Phantom Menace is the weakest of the four Star Wars films, but how could it live up to the hype?  It is not anywhere close to the disappointment other films like Jurassic Park and Godzilla were, but it has its share of problems. Lucas' script is predictable and his dialogue at times is p*** poor.  I have been told that he spent years on the script; other writers have done better with less time.  The script is a bit closer to The Matrix than the brilliant Fifth Element a couple years ago. The most annoying thing is the character of Jar Jar Binks.  He is Lucas' attempt at comic relief, but everytime he spoke I cringed.  I cringed twice as hard when he did something allegedly funny or cute. However, I must credit Lucas' direction.  The visuals are the most outstanding ever.  He keeps the style of the original films, but improves the effects considerably.  This films should be up for sound, sound effects editing, art direction, visual effects, and makeup around Oscar time.  As far as best picture, it does not stand a chance. The acting is alright, with one standout in the ensemble.  This film may be Natalie Portman's big break.  She has delivered stong performances over the years in The Professional, Heat, and Beautiful Girls.  In Portman's hands Queen Amidala outshines, McGregor's Obi-Wan and Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn. She also outshines all the colorful creatures.  This girl has a future, I hope her performance will be taken seriously. The Phantom Menace is not perfection.  I did not expect perfection, but it is quite well done thanks to George Lucas' direction, visual effects, and Natalie Portman's amazingly strong performance.",0
2913,10.0,"Well, after seeing Star Wars, I was left with that shakey feeling a person gets after riding a roller coaster. I'm guessing that I didn't blink once throughout the entire film.

I would highly recommend spending the money and watching this film as soon as you can, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.",1

2916,8.0,"The effects are spectacular, the costumes and makeup fabulous, and the computer work is better than anything I've seen, but the characters could have been cut from cardboard.

The Phantom Menace gets amazingly dogged by critics and many moviegoers, despite being the finest film of the year.",1
2918,10.0,"I really liked this movie. I have heard some very good points about how the story was lacking, but in the long run, I think it was just fine. I think it did a great job of setting up the rest of the first trilogy. If people look too much into it, they will forget a very important fact, it's ONLY Star Wars, and it is not meant to be some life-changing experience. It's only the critics who think that, at least that's my opinion. It is meant to be a simple story of good vs. evil that the whole family can enjoy. People say it appears to be made for a younger audience, and I agree, but it also has a lot to offer to the older crowd as well. The funny thing, though, was how similar the story line is to that of A New Hope (Episode IV). Exact same idea. a Queen is in danger, and a young Skywalker from Tatooine comes to the rescue. Obi-Wan has an influence on the Skywalker. R2-D2 and C3PO are there, and a younger apprentice must see their master die. In the end, there is a celebration, and the queen honors the victors. the end. It is so simple. But it works, and I think the fans will like it too.Oh yeah, if you look real close, you'll even see E.T. in the movie.",1
2919,10.0,"I went into The Phantom menace looking for a stinker, but i came away with what was an awesome movie. First, the only downsides were Jar Jar binks and all of the accidental victories(see the movie). Now the good side:  The sound in the THX theater, the acting, seeing a young darth vader and obi wan,Samuel L Jackson, The future emperor as a good guy, The more evil than words Darth Maul, and of course the wonderful special effects. The beautiful Natalie Portman earned her keep in this film with in my opinion the best acting. Jake Lloyd who played Anakin Skywalker also did a wonderful job for his age and the immense role he was asked to take on. Less than 1100 days to go until Episode 2, i can't wait.

2921,7.0,"From a production standpoint, this is a big-screen experience that can't be matched. Perhaps a tad too much computer generated imagery in that a few scenes were handled in such fashion that didn't have to be, but that's minor quibble on my part. Given that so many new characters were introduced, I didn't mind the fact that were delved into deeper. That's for the next 2 movies anyway. I did find one major annoyance in the Jar Jar Binks character. I'll ignore the assininity surrounding his appearances (which are myriad) as best I can when I see it a second time. I'm no longer the same kid who saw Star Wars when it was released, but I'm betting even kids won't warm up his ridiculous one-dimensionality. Hope he's one show character. I enjoyed the performances of the rest of the cast wholeheartedly, even the characters who weren't supposed to be likable. Also enjoyed being able to see a little more of the political background the saga is set against. Senator Palpatine was the best of the lot, and I hope we get more and more of him.",1
2922,10.0,"I give the movie a 10/10 for sheer effort, imagination and escapism. ",0
2923,7.0,"One thing I need to get off my chest: George Lucas has seemingly become so enveloped in his obsession over technology that he has lost grasp of the original storytelling talents that made the first three installments of this saga great.  Those were successful because the stories were tales anyone could relate to and while the acting was not Shakespearean, the characters were interesting with believable motivations.  Phantom is ill paced and the relationships between characters do not seem to have relevancy.  As a fan I would say simply that the film didn't find me wanting to run to the store and by the action figure for any particular character.  All and all though, it is still a good film-- much better than the usual summer drivel offered each summer.  I guess as much as I denied it to myself and friends, I wanted this film to live up to all the hype it was receiving.  Maybe next time George.",0
2924,1.0,"The Phantom Menace may quite possibly be the best movie I have seen in years. George Lucas really hit the head of the nail on this one. The introduction of new characters as well as a new look on old ones was a refreshing breath of air. The iconic and widely adored Jar-Jar Binks makes his premiere in the epic motion picture, where he en-captures the viewer with his awkward appearance and lovable personality. It is quite a treat to see what kind of mischief the clumsy Gungan gets himself and his friends into.",1
2925,5.0,"Hype.  Too much hype.  Not enough time behind the pen.  We don't care about special effects.  When will they get it?  It's fluff, do it when it makes sense, stop writing scenes around it.  And a 10 minute pod race? What the? A great trumpet player could hold a high E for 60 seconds, that doesn't make it art.  Lose the weird alien versions stereotypes of earth, e.g. Jamaican Jar-Jar, Asian Traders, and Italian Junk man.  That's just stupid-creepy. A tip for Lucas, who wouldn't listen, although he has more money than the Pope and could afford to take a chance at losing marketing:  Write dialogue, develop the characters, give your main bad guy a speaking part.  Give your main good guys  a chance to act with out S-FX help.",0
2926,7.0,"I would suggest this movie to anyone. It's a good movie even a non sci-fi fan would enjoy. It had excellent graphics; and the racing scene was spectacular. I don't want to give anything away, but I must say the plot was a little soft. The young actor who played Skywalker showed little emotion in his lines, and had lines that were cheesy. For example, ""This is tense!""",0
2927,8.0,"In my opinion, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace did its job of creating new worlds for the audience to explore and telling us the backstory to a legendary epic.  It was no less and no more.  Many people cite character development as the Achilles heel of this movie.  They compare it to the original trilogy of how Luke, Leia and Han go through character changes.  Well, the character development of Episodes 4,5,6 cannot be done in one movie.  And, Lucas didn't feel obligated to make Qui-Gon, Obi, and Amidala go through the same character development as Luke, Han, and Leia did in Episode 4.  Lucas has the promise of developing his characters in Episodes 2 and 3 while Episodes 5 and 6 was not guaranteed after making the initial Star Wars movie.  Most ""fans"" went in with a cookie-cutter view of what the Phantom Menace should've been.  And it didn't fit.  I went in to have fun in the adventure, and I did!  In fact, the second time was even better than the first!  Legends weren't made in a day and the greatness of The Phantom Menace won't be realized for years to come.  Star Wars is still continuing to pave the way for better filmmaking--maybe not necessarily better screenwriting.  That was never Lucas' strong point.  Although I hope Lucas can hire a screenwriter, such as Lawrence Kasdan, in the future, The Phantom Menace did its job in giving us an action-packed, visual masterpiece while not pretending to be an Academy-award winner by any means.  I give it ***1/2.  There's room for improvement, but it is one of the only movies in recent memory where it delivered the goods that it promised.  They never promised Oscar-winning dialogue or deep character development.  So, put away your cookie cutters and lighten up!  And who cares if it never beats Titanic...as if dollars signs symbolized validity.",1

It also setup the rest of the prequel well. Forget the hype, forget the hype that the hype got... when choosing a fun summer movie, this should be at the top of everyone's list.

Also, how does the sleek, colorful look of the episode one ships evolve into the boxy, plain, unpainted, ugly ships in IV,V,VI??

2936,10.0,"I had the pleasure of attending The Phantom Menace just yesterday, and to me it was well worth the wait. My children and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I had read most of the comments on this site before I attended, and a lot of comments on your site since, and I am, in some ways offended by a lot of the people who haven't bothered to take the time to THINK before they speak about the movie, or the whole series in general. I saw the original Star Wars in the theatres when it first came out. It was a GREAT movie, and still is, but at its time, also had it's detractors.I think that some of them are probably the same ones (or same types of people) who are it's nay-sayers today. They seem to have forgotten one simple fact - this is a MOVIE. Reading more into it than necessary is simply silly.It's ENTERTAINMENT. Trying to put it down, or tear it apart simply because it didn't meet up to YOUR technical standards, or YOUR idea of what kind of story that George Lucas should tell is childish. Yes it is aimed at children. It is also aimed at the child in all of us who just want to forget about the stresses of everyday life for a couple of hours. The film accomplishes this very well indeed. I feel somewhat sorry for all of you who can't let go and just enjoy the ride. All forms of entertainment require a suspension of disbelief. My kids had a blast. I had a blast. None of the three of us expected ""Ghandi"" or ""Schindler's list"", just a romping good visual and audio experience with a fairy tale type story thrown in for good measure. EXACTLY, if you recall was the original intention with the first Star Wars as well. I will not give away any of the story. It's just too darn good. I will see it a second time, and I suggest you harsh critics see it again as well, only this time... leave your preconceived notions and your words like ""obiquitous"" and ""my discerning eye"" at the door. Maybe you'll actually have a good time. If not, maybe you are just too darn smart for the rest of us - the great unwashed - and you should take your little act off to hollywood and make your own version. I rate this move 9 out of 10",1
2937,,"Star Wars 4 (aka ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"") isn't as terrible as so many people say. It's no worse than the other ten thousand movies that have tried to copy Star Wars. Like most of those, the SFX are phoney-looking and obvious (except for the machines - CGI can do machines really well), the characters range from bland to annoying, and the plot is a thinly-disguised ""The Hidden Fortress"". But Natalie Portman as The Clown Queen gets to wear some really pretty costumes, and the roly-poly battle 'droids are pretty nifty. And the exterior shots of buildings and landscapes were nice... the first few times. After that it was ""George, we've seen it, move on....""",0
2938,10.0,"The plot of the movie i won't go into detail, but in not so may words, the movie, is F%#&ing awesome, the special FX's are the best i have seen in my life. No movie has ever been captured, with such beauty, and elegance, from the sets to the c.g.i, to the fighting scenes. It's incredible Lucas has created a masterpeice, i heard some bad reviews, and to those who gave it bad reviews shame on you for missing the point... This movie has humor, FX's, Action, and the beginning of a love story which i believe, will be the best ever set on film. The old saying when lucas came out with A.N.H was, ""they don't make movies like this"" what i say is they should make more movies like this. Unlike the other great movie of the year, and probably the best movie of the year, till T.P.M came out of course ""the matrix"", T.P.M, has more eye candy, and humor to hold you in your seats, and believe me i was hook't to the screen, i mean i had to use the rest room for like an hour during the movie, and did not go cus i did'nt want to miss out on anything. I'm so glad i didnt use the rest room. =0) Lucas has combined what i believe is some of the coolest looking characters in films history, and the casting of Liam Neeson as QUI GON JIN was perfect, i believe he has played the role he was born to play. And as for Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, i have been a fan of his since trainspotting, and was ecstatic when i heard he was casted for this movie, and i think he is as perfect to play the role of Obi Wan Kenobi i think he pulls it off really well, especially the fight scene. But he was not the main jedi knight in it, and probably will have more screen presence in episode 2. As for Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala she was good in it, and she looks great in it, she is becoming a very beautiful woman, so i think she is also perfect for this movie, and she did a good job in it, so it works out fine. There is tho something about the film that botherd me well two things in fact, one that Darth Maul does not come out more in the movie, i have become his biggest fan, he looks so damn cool in that make up, and that double lightsaber is to die for... I hope some how someway he is back in episode 2, even tho he had something happen to him, which i won't say cus i don't want to give anything at all away, i want people to see this movie for them self's... But needless to say he is the best looking, character in the movie, he looks evil and by just looking at him, you can tell what he is all about, he is one hell of a character, like i said i want more maul, this is where i beg i guess, i know the chances of mr lucas seeing this review is slim to none, but in case he does see it, here is what i have to say, please please please, have maul back in episode 2, i mean i know millions of people would be blown away if he is back, and in more of the movie. I know i'll be happy to see him again... I mean the times he is on the screen i was jumping up and down on my seat on the edge almost screaming. Now to the second problem i had with the movie, simply put it was too short, i think it could have been another half hour long, so that we could have seen A: more maul, B: more of Liam Neeson C: more of the queens, building relationship with Anakin Skywalker, speaking of who i thought young  Jake Lloyd was not great but not bad in it, he did a good job considering he is a kid, and all, i think he has a great future in the buisness... But getting back to my second problem with the movie, yes i would have like't it to be longer, for those reasons. But the good thing in all this, is that there is yet another one coming out in 2 years, so mr lucas can get all the info from us the fans, and see what we like, and dont like, so that he can shape the next one to fit the demand of the fans... I know what my demad is ""MORE MAUL"".  =0) In all from a scale of 1 - 10 this movie is an 11, i mean you add everything in and you cannot do anything but marvel at how well made this movie is, and now i know lucas has had 20 plus to make this scrip't come to life, but still i think he has out done himself, i mean out of all the STAR WARS movies, this is without a doubt the best one, hands down, and i love the old trilogy mind you, i like them a lot but this movie is just incredible, i have seen it twice now, and plan on seeing it again like 30 more times, before the years over, so mr lucas you get an A+ from me, good luck on episode 2...

Not only is this character utterly annoying and nonsensical to the plot; the main problem with this character is that you KNOW that he is completely digitally created. He just didn't seem real. And how many times have you been caught looking at the background special effects, than the actual character interactions in front of you? Despite such flaws, the movie is very enjoyable and I am happy to see another Star Wars movie. The climatic fight scene at the end with Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul should not be forgotten as I consider it the most awesome fight scene in all of cinema. Even though the computer effects are over done, the visuals are amazingly innovative and spectacular. Natalie Portman's (Queen Amidala) acting is notably great despite lukewarm acting by the others.

I also would like to say to anyone that is rejecting The Phantom Menace that they should open their souls and realize that these movies were made to be enjoyed, not to be debated.  George Lucas makes Star Wars movies for money, true, but you will never convince me that he doesn't know how much joy his creations have given the world.

Sometimes I put it in the second place of my favorite and other timer in the last one. My favorite Episode is the VI Return of the Jedi. I am not going to mention why, because this is from Episode I The Phantom Menace and not from Episode VI. Well, in the movie (SW EP I TPM) almost all is ok. There is a very good group of actors. I liked the performance of Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson for the best. But Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best were enjoyable too. All the actors were enjoyable. The story was very good. It was a good start for the whole Saga. The way Palpatine is gaining power, the way Anakin went to be trained by Obi-Wan, the way in which Palpatine hides in the shape of Darth Sidious, the Trade Federation, the way C-3PO and R2D2 joined each other, etc. Plot was good too. The only bad thing I found were some dialogues, that were made for us to laugh but were not appropriated for the moment. But for the rest, all was perfect. Special Effects were so great, I loved them. But I am not a Star Wars fan because of the special effects only, I love the story of the Star Wars Saga. The costumes of Queen Amidala were so beautiful (the movie will win an Oscar for Costume Design for sure!). I liked Jar Jar Binks, I didn't found him a bad character, or a stupid guy or anything bad. And he's form of speaking was cool. Ohh, and the music performance was perfect. I loved it a lot. Dues of the Fates and the Augie's Great Municipal Band were perfect scores. John Williams is the best, he's the King of music scoring. (He deserves the next Oscar for Best Song!) Well, STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE is a great movie, a STAR WARS movie. I really liked it and I enjoyed it a lot. I cried when Anakin went with Qui-Gon and left his mommy, and when Qui-Gon died. Also at the beginning and at the ending.

I think it's a fantastic movie and a great addition to the Saga. Now I'm even more excited about EPII & III because of TPM and How good it is. And best of all, TPM didn't stoop to gore, swearing, sex, or other smut like titanic and other blockbusters did to get ratings. Phantom Menace is a massive success based on its content, not it's shock value. You can your kids to see it your first time and not be worried about what they see or hear. A blockbuster you can take your kids too and not have to cover their ears or eyes for risk of them picking up things you don't want them too see or hear. Great movie.",1
2955,10.0,First let me start off by saying: Whoa!!! Because that's what i felt like after waking out of the theater. I mean everything that was done in the movie was so flawless and breathtaking that  you'd swear you can feel the force yourself!,0
2956,,"after viewing the movie for a second time. I really enjoyed the special effects and fight scenes. It seemed silly with the fight scene, when darth maul and liam say nothing at all, you would figure that liam would be interested in the sidth interest are. The characters seem to drag especially when jar-jar is placed in ridiculous situations, just as the ewokies did; which takes away from the movie as a whole. Although i will buy it when it comes out on dvd.",1
2957,9.0,"Phantom Menace was worth the wait.  I loved the movie and I can not wait to see Episode 2.  I also loved being able to take my daughter to see a Star Wars movie.  I know a lot people can not stand Jar Jar, but my daughter got a real kick out of watching him.  Kudos to George Lucas for keeping the kids in mind.",1
2958,7.0,"What the hell was going on in the first 15 minutes!  Only thanks to reading the novel a few weeks before hand was i able to keep a grasp on what was going on.  I think Lucas tried to cram as much as possible in to the time alloted, he could have made it 3-3.5 hours if he wanted.  Mind you I had to sit through Daas Boot in two sittings.  For some reason i want to go and watch it again. I don't know why..........I leave you with this, no wonder young Skywalker turned to the dark side if his mom kept calling him ANNIE!!!!!!!!",0
2959,2.0,Ugh! This is not worth your time or money.  Lucas gets so excited about the special effects that he forgets the story.  It helps in a three part story to actually have one.,1
2960,,"As of this review there are 1593 other reviews, but after reading about a hundred I am left wondering why everyone seems to hate this movie. It's not supposed to be taken seriously! It's supposed to take you to a ""galaxy far, far away"". Some things in other worlds probably won't make sense to us.",0
2961,10.0,"I think the Phantom Menace is an excellent film.  Some critics have said its not as good as the others.  Well, I think it is.  I think the critics are saying that because they don't understand the film.  Yes, it may be complicating at some times, but the 4 star movies are always weird and never do well in the box office.  So i say, who cares what the critics think. This film has excellent special effects, and the music was composed very well.  I really enjoyed the pod racing seen, too. Whats more to say, its an excellent film.  ****",1
2962,10.0,"This film is a masterpiece. I love it. The magnificent dialogue, the wonderful acting by Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best...It's so dense; every single frame has so much going on... Sure, George Lucas may have gone too far in some places, but it was stylistically designed to be that way, and he did diminish the effects a lot. This movie is the best movie since Cop Dog. Of course it's not as good as Titanic, but how could Lucas beat Titanic??? It's impossible. Also, I sure as hell live the scene where Jar Mar steps on the poop. That's a great scene. The only complaint I have with this movie is the lack of Jar Jar scenes. He's the best character in the film. Watch it now, you Hack Frauds.",1

2964,7.0,"The Phantom Menace is a good addition to the Star Wars saga. The special effects are stunning, and good performances are put in by both Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi respectively. The film manages to generate the excitement of the earlier trilogy, and sets the scene nicely for the next two films. My only gripes are that Jar Jar was rather annoying and needed a translator, that we didn't see more of Darth Maul and that Queen Amidala and Anakin's roles were played in a rather forced manner.",0
2965,7.0,It has been a long time since the first trilogy and when I came out of the cinema I could feel the force again. To be honest the film was more for teenager and kids with the new animated characters. However the battle in the universe of good (the Jedi's) against evil was the main theme of the film. Some very cool scenes which reminded me of games like Dune2000 were nice to watch as part of a film. Highly recommended for parents which want their kids to feel the force of being on the right side... (a must see for Science Fiction fans).,1
2966,2.0,The film totally betrays the former trilogy.,0
2967,,"I've made a couple other comments on this movie, and I hope that the people who hated The Phantom Menace have read them because I think that I made my points quite clear on why this movie is good. Today I came across someone's point of view about Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber.  She thought it was stupid that he had a lightsaber like that because no one in the original trilogy had a double-bladed lightsaber - and those movies take place after Episode I - and a double-bladed lightsaber is more advanced than a single bladed one.  So it shouldn't have existed yet. I was so mad at this remark because it's so ignorant.  She had to go home before I got a chance to convince her that yes, a double-bladed lightsaber could very well exist in the times before Episodes IV-VI.  So I decided to post a comment on the IMDB about it to get it off my chest. First off, I think that double-bladed lightsabers are a ""Sith"" thing.  The Jedi probably just use single-bladed ones.  I don't think that ALL Sith use a D-B Lighsaber, but I bet a lot do.  Either that, or it's just something that Darth Maul himself developed on his own.  I mean, he's this strange alien with an unknown background.  Who know's what he's capable off?  And maybe some Jedi might use D-B lighsabers, but it seemed to me that in Episode I, they were quite astounded when Darth Maul pulled out his weapon, so I don't think the Jedi have even seen a D-B lighsaber before.  So the main question that arises is, ""Why doesn't Darth Vader have a double-bladed lightsaber in the original trilogy?  He's a sith, right?""  The answer is very simple.  Yes, he IS a sith, but Darth Vader was originally trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi - who uses a S-B lightsaber.  So most likely Darth Vader is going to use a S-B lightsaber as well, don't you think?  Because that's what he was trained to use.  So D-B lightsabers COULD very well exist in the times of Episodes IV-VI.  It's just that Darth Vader was trained as a Jedi, to use a S-B lightsaber.  And the same thing goes for Luke Skywalker as well. Also, a double-bladed lightsaber could've existed before Episodes IV-VI because not only hasn't the Empire taken over and destroyed everything yet, but a D-B lighsaber is just basically two lightsabers stuck together. That's it.  Not much thought went into inventing this deadly weapon.  It's not that much more advanced than a S-B lightsaber at all.  So yes, a D-B lightsaber could have existed before the original trilogy. Have I made my point clear? If any of you out there have read this comment, or other comments I've made, and you agree or disagree, I want to hear what you think. I'm just sick of people trashing a well made movie.",1
2968,,"Okay, I think I've made a comment before in the Internet Movie Database, but now I'd like to comment on how so many people thought this movie was horrible.  I just want to point how some of the things that people talked about can be easily discredited.",1
2969,,"Okay, I think I've made a comment before in the Internet Movie Database, but now I'd like to comment on how so many people thought this movie was horrible.  I just want to point how some of the things that people talked about can be easily discredited.",1
2970,7.0,"I loved the movie. It really got me going. I saw the first one when I was about 6. Qui Gon and Obi Wan were very cool as characters. Amidala was good, very noble air. Darth Maul was very evil looking but underplayed. Anakin was good and childlike, I feel sorry for him because I know what his future holds. The Senator/Emperor is a slimy no good...You get the idea. The saber duel was great with Maul pacing and Qui resting. It was a classic scene that helped make the movie. Jar-Jar was sort of lame. Not as bad as I was lead to believe but his voice was annoying and the animation wasn't that good. My view: See it, it was good.",1
2971,10.0,People expecting the Second Coming will be disappointed by Episode I. Even Lucas himself said so. ,0
2972,8.0,This movie will entertain you with the greatest visual FX ever! It will entertain you with great exasperating action sequences and the most stylish lightsabre fighting ever seen.,1
2973,5.0,"This contains some slight spoilers, but if you do see this film, I doubt you'll fault me for ""spoiling"" this kitsch.",0
2974,,"The thing you must remember when watching this movie is that it is a family movie. Too many people I know went along expecting to see a big long script full of important speeches about life and so on. This a FAMILY movie. Too many people judge it on the script (or lack of), or the characterisation. It is mainly for the kids. So what if Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever, or Ewan McGregor does the sh*ttiest english accent, it doesn't matter. Kids like Jar Jar Binks, and don't care about Ewan McGregor's accent. When I first watched this movie, there were some younger kids in front of me and they were moaning about how boring it was. But as soon as Darth Maul came on and lit up his double sided lightsaber, they were so interested that by the end of the movie, they were on the edge of their seats. So don't judge it on the script or the acting, I mean, it does have some good things like Darth Maul and the fight scene. It ROCKS!!! Darth Maul really is a creepy dude. His facial expressions in the fight were hilarious. (They weren't bad, they just looked realistic. Like a rugby game in slow motion) Just remember, when you do see this movie, that it is a FAMILY movie.",0
2975,6.0,"When this movie was released, it got panned by several friends of mine for lacking the character nuances of the first three.  Not being an especially big fan of any of the STAR WARS movies, I thought that was kind of stupid. As far as I'm concerned, none of them are as deep or thoughtful as STAR WARS die-hards seem to believe.",0
2976,10.0,"I may have written about this movie before, but I don't think so.  This was quite simply an amazing movie.  To show you how little knowledge of Star Wars I had when I first saw it, I didn't realize that Anakin was Darth Vader- I figured he might have changed his name to Luke later on or something.  I know, I know;  Hey, i was tired.  The second time i saw it I had more of an idea of what was going on, and now I'm hooked.  I rented the other ones, loved them, and I wish i could speed up time to see the next two. How could you put down this masterpiece?  This has become my favorite movie ever.  The only down point is the acting in some parts, but the Queen isn't supposed to be like Leia, and I doubt that they were looking for Oscars with the acting anyway.  Jar Jar, poor Jar Jar:  people hate him, but i think he's awesome!  The Jedi knights are spectacular.  You get so absorbed into this world in the Star Wars movies.  Darth Maul, menacing, but not the menace, as lots of people think. My friends and I put 2 and 2 together and when we realized Sidious was Palpatine, it was like ""a-ha!"" We were proud of ourselves when we stayed for the credits and Sidious wasn't listed.  The special effects- what can you say. Say what you will about Phantom Menace.  It made a fan out of me.",1
2977,3.0,"As everyone who loves Star Wars I was looking forward to this film with such delight. However after viewing this film, i left the cinema with utter disappointment. I think that this flim was made purely for money. There is not indepth story of the characters. Infact there are far too many of them.",0
2978,1.0,Don't get me wrong. This film had good imaginative special effects. My favourite visuals were the R2 units being dispatched to fix the sleek silver copy of an SR71 Blackbird.,0
2979,,"From a person who absolutley hated the first Star Wars movies, this one is outstanding... There is so much action in it, that you do not get bored, untill the end, that part is dragged out a little.  Anyhow, people who don't like it need to just relax, yeah, it isn't the same Star Wars as before, Hello Losers, it isn't supposed to be!!! And don't diss the director, he can do whatever the hell he wants to, he did the first one how he wanted, and if he wants these ones to be different just role with it.  I do think we should have been able to spend more time with each character, but then again my butt was numb after the three hours it took to watch it like it is, if it were any longer I wouldn't be able to walk for weeks.",0
2980,10.0,"There was more talk about this movie as on anyone previously released. It was definitely the cinematic event of the milenium. Before the movie was even released, there have been negativ critics about it, what can you expect afterwards. Lots of people, who went to see it, had the idea that it was bad. Well folks, I have news for you. It is not. It just makes me angry to think about all the main-stream people, who let themselfes influence so much by critics. ""Well, when they say, it's bad than probably it is"". Give the movie a chance instead. Look at it as if you've never even seen the original Star Wars Trilogy, and - more important- as if you've never heard the opinion of all the critics who are just watching the movies to find any little mistake. Right, acting doesn't deserve any Oscars, nor does the Writing. But what is important about a movie? IT'S ENTERTAINMENT!!! If I were George Lucas, I wouldn't care all too much about critics, it's preferable to make an entertaining movie such as TPM, to making some highly acclaimed film like ""the thin red line"", who made a lot of people leave the cinema after one and a half hour. Look at TPM as part one of an epic saga, it's just introduction folks, don't expect huge battles on the first pages of a novel, do you?",0
2981,3.0,"I'll keep it brief - I WAS a fan of Star Wars. Any one who says this movie is a masterpiece clearly has no right reviewing films. This ""film"", if I can call it that, is more calculated and commercial than any piece-of-garbage summer flick to come down the pipe in quite some time. It almost makes Godzilla look heartfelt. Lucas has sold out big time, not that he hadn't done so earlier, but this is really reaching new lows. Perhaps George should take a little time to examine why he started making films so long ago. Make a statement, for God's sake put your heart fully into something. What do the words ""Jar-Jar"" mean to you, well thats the entire movie as far as I'm concerned. The Phantom Menace is ""Jar-Jar"". One big fake cartoon made to entertain the slow-witted and create toy-consuming zombies of us all. Do you really believe there is a shred of dignity left in the series after this tired piece of crap. It is a shame, I actually respected good-old George for a period of time.",0
2982,,"I've seen The Phantom Menace ten times now.  I still love it.  From the moment I stepped into the theater on opening day(May 19) through the moment I saw it in late January 2000, I was impressed.  But one who watches this movie should not only see it more than twice, but should consider what's GOING to happen in the future episodes. Yes, the characters were under-developed.  But they WILL be more developed later on.  They didn't have to be GREATLY developed like some people want. People don't have any patience.  If only they'd wait until all three movies are done, and THEN criticize the WHOLE story as they see fit.  The characters WILL be more developed then.  Even Lucas said that Episode II will not be FX-driven, but more Character-driven.  I mean, Amidala and Anakin fall in love and get married.  That's GOT to develop some character! And I know the Clone Wars will be exciting, with Anakin's heroic pride taking over.  That will show character as well.  And Obi-Wan we'll definitely see more of since he's training Anakin.  We'll learn more about him.  And Sidious/Palpatine.  He definitely will be more revealed in the next two movies.  So if we already knew too much about these characters in Episode I, what's the point in going onto the next movies besides seeing how Anakin becomes Vader?  Most of us already know how that happens(for the most part).  Lucas purposely left the characters under-developed so that the next two episodes can reveal more.  We'll have something to look forward to. People are comparing ONE movie, to a trilogy(the originals).  I think people should WAIT until all three prequels are done, and then compare one completed story to another.  We didn't really fully understand the characters in the originals until later on.  I mean, we got a taste of who they were in ""A New Hope,"" but it wasn't really a whole lot to go on.  When ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" came out, we had a much better understanding of the characters, AND their story as a whole.  So in ""The Phantom Menace,"" we just got a TASTE of what the characters are like, and a TASTE of what the fully story is about.  Once the other two are made, The Phantom Menace will make more sense than it does now.  People are so used to knowing the whole story of Star Wars(the originals) because the story has been completed for years now.  Most fans of Star Wars are people who were born around the time the movies came out.  So by the time they were old enough to understand the movies, all three were completed.  They didn't have to wait three years in between each movie to find out what happens next.  They could just pop in the next video and find out.  You can't do that with the new ones.  We'll have to wait like other grown people had to wait back in the day.  Once the prequels are completed people will realize that Darth Maul is a throw away character to reveal to the Jedi that the Sith may still exist.  They'll realize that SIDIOUS/PALPATINE is the main villain here.  He's the one who will take over everything.  He's the one who will see to it that the Jedi are destroyed.  Same thing with the Trade Federation.  That was just a pawn in the game that Sidious is playing.  The whole movie was made up of pawns.  I think people are just not looking deep enough for the real story here, and they're just looking at what they see on the outside.  They're stuck in the shallow end of the pool.  If one is a TRUE Star Wars fan, they will love Episode I because they know that it was only meant to be an introduction for the next two, which in turn leads up to the originals. So go see the movie again if you didn't like it the first time.  Look deeper.  Look past Jar Jar.  Look past the outside plot and search deeper. If you don't like this movie after you've seen it a few more times, taking into consideration what I've just talked about, then you were never a true Star Wars fan to begin with.",1

2984,,"Alright, This movie blows.  But if you like Star Wars, You don't care.  Look at the Original.  Mmm.  Setup for the next two movies, which are more dramatic.

2985,2.0,"I admit I would not be as scathing about this movie were not a Star Wars prequel, however that is part of its problem - and its still rubbish anyway. The original Star Wars films are wonderful and to have this horrendous cringe-fest tacked on to the start is sad. This movie is never scary or thrilling, whereas Darth Vader still gives me the chills: memo to Ray Park - takes more than a cape and make-up to be scary and as for the racist-stereotype chinese badguys, awful. Jar-Jar is an awfully annoying character, as are his froggy friends - more racist stereotypes. And I know that we already know what happens in part 4, but couldn't they have at least tried to instill some mystery - even if you were a Star Wars virgin you'd have to be deaf and blind to miss the fact Palpatine is a bad guy, yet at the same time they pretend we might not have realized by keeping his face hidden! Positives? Some nice martial arts fight sequences. Some great effects obviously. The Wacky Racers sequence was fun but silly - like a lot of this movie, I guess.",0
2986,10.0,"Back in 1977, Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope was released.  It changed the way we looked at movies forever.  Over the next six years two more movies were released and both were also very popular.  For sixteen years many other movies tried to capture the magic, but couldn't.  Peoples attitudes also changed over this time.  Episode I was great, but people were expecting far too much from it.  IT IS JUST A MOVIE!!!  Many people also don't like movies that contain graphic violence, swearing etc.  George Lucas could not possibly have made a new Star Wars that everyone would be happy with.  He did bring everyone back to a galaxy far, far away and did it well.  He showed us the beauty of Naboo, the barren landscapes of Tatooine and the gleaming skyscrapers of Coruscant. I think he did a great job, as he brought some magic into people's lives, even maybe for just a few moments.  Isn't that what movies are for, after all....",1
2987,7.0,"I liked the first 3 Episodes of the film very much but I think Star Wars Episode 1 was only OK. The special effects were great, also the music was very good but there was no (good) story. But some actors made this film interesting.",1
2988,2.0,"It's a shame people were so eager to enjoy this film simply because it was a Star Wars film. They defend it because George Lucas can do no wrong  - but he can, unfortunately he did it with the most anticipated film of the decade. Some set pieces regenerated the joy of a great star Wars - you know the ones, The Pod Race, the light sabre battle at the end - and they were great scenes. But between the clunky dialogue, a brat like child and the most unfunny alien since Mac and Me I was left feeling pretty empty. It's like watching someone who had no real understanding of what makes a Star Wars film and trying to replicate it. It shouldn't have been - but it was. The thing is Lucas CAN direct and write, but here after a break from the fold he is struggling. It takes more than amazing special effects to pull an audience in - hasn't Hollywood learned this yet? The site of a lone droid walking alone across a vast desert in the original is a more evocative image than any of the CGI cities and landscapes of TPM. It just seems more real somehow, and pulls the audience in. The Phantom Menace needs special effects, of course it does, but they were in every single scene - and thus took the awe away for the next one. The amount of CGI was overbearing, squashing the story and characters. Oh mumble mumble groan groan.",0

Not only was it edited to death but it features two of the most wooden top-billed performances I've seen in a while: Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman. My fingers are tightly crossed hoping that in Ep 2, Anakin will be too old for Jake to play him. Otherwise, HELP...I don't think I'll be able to sit thru 2 more with him leading the pack. At least Rick(y) Schroder was cute and natural in ""The Champ."" With Jake sporting a perpetual scowl like someone keyed his favorite landspeeder, no wonder Anakin turned into the biggest baddie around. And Natalie looks great but any stiffer and you could use her for siding. I hold out hope for her in future SW chapters because I know she can do better.",1

Now i have studied this film with great scrutiny and I have noticed the impeccable attention to detail in every aspect....actually I did it on a bet with a friend that I could find an error be it audio, visual or both in almost any film....of course he would choose a line of films that are made by a band of people that are pretty meticulous about their work...so ha! i found one, someone tell George Lucas.",1
2994,,"As a Sound Designer, musician, and film maker, I found a masterpiece in Episode 1. Where some people found Lucas to be geared too much toward children or not enough romance these are all valid. Although it will sound ironic, I felt bad for Lucas. He was held up to an impossible standard from the get go. The film was technically flawless. The cast was a success. It was a litle corny but I almost found some humor in that. My only complaint was not the heavy presence of CGI but the absences the beautiful craftsmanship and organic appeal of puppets. It is not possible to beat an impossible standard, but I think Lucas did the best anyone could do.",1

However I still think that it was a great movie and a real treat for avid Star Wars fans. The story line is a little hard to follow at first but on the whole I think that it was a well written movie. The films greatest weakness is JarJar Binks. I found him to be extremely annoying and he was a poor substitute for Chewie as a lovable charactor for kids. The films greatest assets were the lightsabre duals between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the sabre battles. I also enjoyed the seeing the Jedi council because they added more myth and curiosity to the Jedi.

Yes, I am one of the few people that thought that Episode I was the best of the Star Wars saga.  I know some people want to call me an idiot for saying that, but I enjoyed the movie. I thought that George Lucas did an exellent job with this film.  I dont know wether it was the special effects or the plot that caught me, or maybe it was just seeing the scrolling letters at the start.",1

It follows two young jedi nights in their mission to stop the evil Trade Federation. The majority of the film's vast amount of special effects are computer animated. I found this very pleasing to the eye and the fast pace at which it travels keeps the viewer interested and excited",1
2999,,Yes I know it is the beginning to a story. I still hated the thing. The movie was more of a show of what Lucas can do with his FX but there was no substance to the story. It was long and dragged on. It would have been good if he spent more time working on a good story.,1
3000,,"Lucas did it twenty years ago. Invented a marvelous mythological place in a galaxy far away. But not so long ago, in a place much nearer he ignored the masses that enjoyed his fantasies so much and gave the children of today a new line of irritating toys. But we, who grew up up with star wars and rented it again and again, talked and adored that universe, we got nothing but the bitter taste of digital dissapointment. Nowhere were the fantastic imagination that flowed so vividly in the classic trilogy to be found in the bland ruin of droids and silly xenomorphs from jamaica, not even a believeble darker-than-life archenemy could be mustered up, only a laughable Jackie Chan-wannabe. And why, why was the starfight so amateurish? Lucas invented the starfight, but now was it even worse than the ones in early Star Trek:TNG episodes. Well, it is the first part in a new trilogy, and maybe Lucas is just rusty in the ways of the interstellar world.

They were pretty good also, right up until we were introduced to the Ewoks.  That's when my awe was tarnished. What's going on with these teddy bear creatures?  This is serious stuff, saving the universe from evil. 20 years later the ""re-release"" came out.  You remember those, the flicks where they dusted off the old footage and added some nifty kean-o computer effects.  I saw ""Star Wars"" again on the big screen. The extra effects and footage didn't add anything to it, and were somewhat annoying.  It felt like they'd colorized ""Citizen Kane.""  I didn't bother to see Empire and Jedi again. I was pretty excited about seeing Menace.  It had been a long time coming, and George had spent a lot of time on it.  After all this time, we get to see the beginning of the saga. We had folks go down the day that the advance tickets went on sale and stand in line for 6 hours to get tickets.  I went down and held a spot in line for 3 hours.  I know this isn't much compared to the fans who waited for a month outside Mann's Chinese, or even camped out overnight in front of the ""lesser"" theaters, but this was big forme; I usually wait for a matinee after the crowds have died down. I had mixed feelings about seeing it.  I tried to avoid all the marketing hype - all the junk merchandise everywhere I turned.  I wanted to appreciate art for art's sake and not be burned out before I saw it.  I wanted this to be another meaningful experience, like in '77. So I and almost everyone from my company (lots of geeks) shuffled into the theatre for the 4:45pm showing on May 19, 1999.  The place was packed and the crowd was pumped.  We all roared when the opening titles started rolling. Nobody applauded at the end.  I think we were all shocked by the mediocrity. What a disappointment.  The characters weren't compelling.  The computer animation went way overboard.  The story was weak, the dialog was trite at best.  The forward references were sappy and condescending (Yes, George, we realize that these are the same two droids from the later episodes.  Thank you.  OK, that's enough now. You can stop.)  The flow of the story kept getting bogged down with pointless scenes.  Anakin was non-believable to the point of ludicrousy.  What was the point of the CG rasta guy (Jar-Jar? Jim-Jim?  Jum-Jum) aside from merchandising appeal?  Lame comic relief? This guy had less purpose than C3PO.  Darth Maul?  This guy is supposed to be interesting?  It's a tough sell with no dialog.  Why should we hate or fear him?  Tell me George doesn't think that face paint and horns make a compelling villain.  ""See?  This character is the bad guy.  You can tell because he looks like a demon."" Maybe I'm just too old for this movie.  Maybe my memories of the original left my hopes too high.  I expected magic and got a cheap card trick. You should have left it alone, George.",0
3003,,"I enjoyed the film,it's not the nightmare some folks seem to make it out to be. There was no need for Jar Jar or for Anakin to build C3PO and so on. The high point for me was Watto. So much so that I wrote a poem for him. HAIKU FOR WATTO- flying blue daydream/ I can't forget about you/ I have lost my mind",1
3004,6.0,"It was always going to be hard to meet people's expectations after the amount of hype that surrounded the making of this movie.  It seems to be a good one to take the kids to watch.  As a Star Wars fan from way back, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.  There were some obvious plot holes. I also thought there was an over-emphasis on cutting-edge special effects and an under-emphasis on the age old art of story telling.",1
3005,6.0,"This was one of the most anticipated movies of the century. Unfortunately, George Lucas blew it.  It was primarily a vehicle for his special effects and, indeed, they were spectacular.  I just wish he had put the same effort into the story and characters.  The story itself is very predictable with virtually no plot twists to keep us guessing.  I found myself able to predict the next event all throughout the movie.  The story line also seemed very contrived and uninspiring(an interstellar trade conflict).",0
3006,7.0,"it really is unfair to say this movie was bad.  it was just different.  i give the original star wars a 10 because it deserved it.  i gave this only a seven which is ok.  i see this movie as the hobbit of star wars. someting to show anikin skywalker as a child which was a good idea.  to sum it all up i think it is a great movie seperate from the star wars saga, a good prequel to a great saga, and an o.k. star wars movie.  it is just that i was expecting a better movie.  but it is really ok and im glad to see that most people thought it was a kid",1
3007,2.0,"I couldn't believe this film was supposed to be related to the 3 other Star Wars movies. It nauseated me. It made me want to weep at the sheer horror of what they had done to a once-great story. The plot was frighteningly weak, the characters utterly shallow, and the much vaunted special effects were jarring and out of place. In all, I found this movie to be the ultimate triumph of style over substance; a lot of pretty lights and catchy people, with nothing to back it up.",0
3008,9.0,"I know Jar-Jar Binks is annoying, and the special effects were overused, but I think is a good start to the story. Once Episode II and III comes out we will understand the movie better and be able to look at it as part of a 6 episodes.",0

That new character Jar Jar something, needed subtitles to understand what he said.  I was extremely disappointed in this movies and it wasted 2+ hours of my time.  I won't be viewing the next two movies.",0
3012,6.0,"I went to see The Phantom Menace on the second day it was released, with my whole family. I was on holiday before hand, and although I enjoyed it, my mind was really on going home, and seeing The Phantom Menace. The cinema was pretty packed, and I think we managed to avoid all the trailers, so we were just sitting down when the Fox fanfare started. I was sitting next to my sister, who's a big Star Wars fan too, and we were almost pinching each other when the words: Episode I The Phantom Menace appeared on the screen. I quickly got into my film analysing mood, and just sat back at watched it. Although the opening battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon was all terribly exciting, I found myself thinking, ""Come on, get to the plot!"". When Jar Jar arrived on the screen, instead of sighing deeply like the rest of the audience, I actually found him quite funny (he does make me laugh occasionally even now), especially the scenes inside the Bongo. And although I was enjoying it, and on the edge of my seat during most of it, I found myself thinking that when Obi-Wan is hanging onto the edge of the pit during the lightsaber duel, I didn't care particularly if he got his lightsaber or not. I know that sounds like a dreadful thing to say, but if it wasn't for the fact that I liked Obi-Wan in the Classic Trilogy, and liked Ewan McGregor, I wouldn't have cared about the character at all. And I didn't mind Anakin. I thought he's youthfullness fit in exactly with how Luke Skywalker acts in the Classic Trilogy, so he had all the Skywalker traits, although I would have liked it if some of his darker side was shown during the film. Infact, I got a bit fed up with the whole, ""He gives without any thought of reward,"" thingy...it seemed a bit...well, unrealistic...which is a dodgy word to say when you're dealing with Star Wars. Also, I felt a distinct lack of empathy towards Amidaala. She seemed a bit arrogant, frankly. I think her impassive tones got on my nerves after awhile, partly because it sounded like a very rubbish attempt to do a posh English accent. When Padme appeared, I did connect with her more, but she still carried that slightly arrogant streak from before. Qui-Gon's slight sense of detachment was good, too, but after watching it later, it seemed as if Liam Neeson was bored. I thought the whole Darth Sidious/Palpatine was terribly clever, and his honesty towards Amidaala was almost believable...almost. Infact my Dad, who doesn't know much about Star Wars, did manage to work out that Palpatine was up to something, but he didn't realise that Palpatine was Darth Sidious. My Mum, who isn't a big fan of science fiction (she's more into the Psycho/The Mosquito Coast/Chicken Run style of film), but I think she got quickly absorbed into the plot. In fact, she even shed a little tear when Anakin left his mother. My sister didn't like Jar Jar at all, but she found the Nemodians' accent terribly funny, for some reason (well, I did, too).",1

All I can say is that viewers should decide for themselves.",1

3017,6.0,"I love Star Wars!!! For years I lived and breathed nothing but...! It has gotten me interested in everything from comparative mythology to zen buddhism to Kurosawa. So, yes, I was expecting way too much when I went in to Phantom Menace. After being blown away with visuals on the first viewing, like many, I picked it apart in subsequent viewings; picked it apart so much I actually hated it for awhile. The very thought of Jar Jar made me angry! Sure Maul was cool, but you hardly see him. Midichlorians??? What the f#*%??? Doesn't that totally undermine the spiritually inclusive dimension that is ""the Force""???",1
3018,,"This movie was a very good movie.  You may complain of recycled scenes, unoriginality, or that it is much more complex than the originals.  The truth of the matter is that although this movie may not be much like the original trilogy, It is still an excellent movie.  There are magnificent special effects, wonderful drawn out scenes, Beautiful settings, and creative characters.  When people talk about how this might be the worst movie of all time I think...wow they must not have seen very many movies. What is the point of a movie?  To entertain right?  Well just because it wasnt particularly on par with the others doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  I found it to be a great movie.  For those people who dare to go on and say that this was the worst movie ever, I would hate to see what you had to say about movies such as Jurassic Park, The Rock, etc.  In my opinion people need to give this movie a break.  It was over-hyped (much like pearl Harbor) and It was not enough to fill the hype, however It certainly served its purpose. That is why I give the movie an 8/10",1

My review of The Phantom Menace is mainly for those who recognize the number in my username (2187) and not for those who call me ""a geek.""  I hated this movie, but I am ready to back up my argument.  I am also ready to make a few arguments in favor of this film, for as an aspiring filmmaker myself, I would want constructive criticism, not unmerciful bashing.  The main reasons I hated this movie are 1) it doesn't even compare to The Trilogy, 2) it's kind of boring, and 3) Jar Jar Binks.",0

3021,7.0,First of all this movie is probably the worst of the original 6 Star Wars movies. I have rewatched this film like a week ago. And I felt like it was worse then I remembered. I have always been a prequel fan. I think the backlash was unnecessary and undeserved. So let's talk about the negatives. I get the fact that the use of cgi is revolutionary but it is a little too much. Also the speed of the story is a little slow but it is acceptable. I don't think that little Anakin and Jar Jar is that bad. I think their scenes are acceptable and nice new additions. Overall this film is a decent film. I don't think that it is that bad.,0
3022,,"I think that the main gripe among Star Wars fans is the fact that Episode I is not like any other movies in the series. I happen to dissagree.  If you watch Episode IV you will see that it is only designed to introduce characters and not to develop them.  The development of the characters happens in the next two movies, that is why people say that Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original trilogy.  All Episode I is meant to do is to introduce characters that will be developed further in the next two movies in the trilogy.  I think that you have to give George Lucas credit for being able to develop such a lush movie in which to introduce his characters. And as for you people who hate Jar Jar I think that yes he is anoying but he helps give the movie a comic relief that was not seen in the original trilogy. What I am trying to say is not to judge Episode I too harshly until you see the next two movies!!!!!!!! Personally, I think that Episodes II and III are going to rock!!!",1

3027,5.0,"I must say this movie was a bit of a disappointment right after coming off from seeing the original trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi). This movie did not contain enough action and was a bit more of an adventure type. In my opinion, this is by far the worst Star Wars film of all six. The character Jar Jar Binks was a little bit funny at first, but after a while he just got annoying. He was supposed to be like the new Chewbacca character which everyone was supposed to like, but that was obviously a failure. The only memorable part of the movie, in my opinion, was the lightsaber duel in the end. The movie over all seemed too childish.",0
3028,,"With AOTC just around the corner, I feel the need to respond to some of the comments I've seen posted here and give my take on Episode I. To all of you who claim this is the worst film ever, grow up!  It's not, and you know it's not.  Save your exaggerations for your tax forms.  To those who claim the film is a far cry from the great films of the original trilogy, or as was written more than once, ""not a Star Wars film"", I ask you, what were you watching when you saw the original trilogy?  Have you watched A New Hope recently?  Just like Phantom Menace, ALL of the Star Wars films have lousy, choppy dialogue, a story that is difficult to follow, and often full of holes, borderline acting, and confusing editing.  I mean come on, even Sir Alec Guiness, a reknown Shakespearean actor couldn't pull off some of Lucas' ridiculous dialogue.",0
3029,6.0,"I am a fan of the Star Wars Saga, I truly am, but please : Jar Jar Binks? There dialogues were awful, the movie could have been a lot less longer.

Please let episode 2 be better!",0
3030,8.0,"A lot of people didn't like this movie, and their reasons are valid.  The dialogue was bad, which in turned made the actors seem not that great.  Jar Jar was definitely annoying.  But the movie as a whole was still entertaining.  I loved the Jedi fights, and the pod race.  The CGI robots and other creatures i thought were well done visually, and the story did have a point and a plot.  Unfortunately, its mostly a set up movie for the next one, which also hurts it.  But overall, it was enjoyable and fun, and definitely worth seeing.",1
3031,,"In a recent interview, George Lucas was asked about how it felt to have one of his films loathed by so many people.  His response was that it was the highest grossing Star Wars film thus far, so the naysayers must be a very vocal minority.  Instead of sidestepping this issue, I hope to convince people that _The Phantom Menace_ is just as good as any of the other Star Wars films.",0
3032,1.0,"People are actually going to hate this movie completely because of jar jar Binks? besides that name being just as awesome as Jabba the Hutt, or Han Solo, he wasn't that bad of a supporting character. Yeah he speaks in a slightly Jamaican dialect, that's not racist. Just lazy. If any person was raised in Jamaica they would speak the native Patwa language. I don't see Sasquatch gathering lawyers to sue Lucas for rights to Chewbacca's character likeness. ",0
3033,3.0,This film is absolute rubbish.Jar Jar binks should be shot tarred all over and used as a very big torch.You can see why some animal parents eat their young. As for Anakin he was so annoying. Its great to think that the most powerful Jedi saved the film by accidently pressing a button. Yippeeeee he must have thought. This film only got 3/10 for me simply because its star wars.George lucas stop directing you had the right idea with the first 3 films.Ps the CGI is crap i think he should talk to peter jackson and his staff about how to do properly and with out so much shinyness,0
3034,,"It should be noted the 10 I've voted encompasses the entire Star Wars saga, episodes I-VI. But I think time will be kind to The Phantom Menace. If you're already a fan of the movies, and know the original trilogy backwards and forwards, and can't put what you know aside while you're watching THE PHANTOM MENACE, this half will sidetrack you. It's a given. You'll get strung up on the point Anakin constructed (or more properly, REconstucted) Threepio, you'll get hung up on the kid because you know his destiny is to become Darth Vader. The midichlorians will get on your nerves because you'll begin to think the Force is a biological thing and not mystical anymore. It's both. The biggest complaint of THE PHANTOM MENACE I've ever heard is, ""I waited 16 years for an intergalactic trade boycott?"" We really didn't. We've waited 22 years for REVENGE OF THE SITH. Of course the biggest problem is everyone's seen the ending first. To be able to watch this movie fresh, you'd have to unlearn what you have learned. Get the Rebellion and the Empire out of your system. There is no Rebellion. No Empire. This is the most difficult thing to do. I've only just begun to truly look at it objectively for what it is. Upon my initial viewing, I couldn't help trying to notice ""firsts."" There aren't very many. Like the other installments, THE PHANTOM MENACE is very tight and fast-paced. If you're with what's proceeding. If you're not, by the time you get to Tatooine with the Jedi, you have no investment with what they're there for. To get their ship fixed so they can get the hell outta Dodge. There isn't much room in the plot for anything else. And why should there be? There are five more episodes to go. ",1
3035,,"I am a big fan of Episodes 4-6, and I think it was essential to make 1-3. Though this movie was decent, I was very unimpressed with many things. First, Jar Jar Binx. Please, somebody kill this annoying goof. The character of Jar Jar Binx alone has seemingly transformed the Star Wars saga into an annoyingly immature travesty. Had Jar Jar Binx been eliminated from the script, or at least been made not SO incredibly bothersome, this was movie would've been much, much, MUCH better. And the child actor who played Anakin - horrible, absolutely ridiculous. If not for the great performances of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson, this movie would've been entirely disposable, acting wise.",0
3036,,"While I necessarily don't agree with all the hate that Episode 1 is getting, I can see why fans are mad. George Lucas took CGI by the horns and tried to 'carry' his production with it. However, I did enjoy this movie, although a rehashing gone wrong there are still some great aspects. The new series allowed newer generations to experience the force that was 'Star Wars' in a different way, not necessarily bad, just different. ",1

Another flaw is that this film is that its incredibly boring, for an hour and a half i was snoozing, its all ""bla bla bla, republic, republic, bla bla bla"" and there's boring scenes with the jedi council, more boring scenes where liam neeson talks about negotiating and more boring (and annoying) scenes with the crime against nature known as jar jar binks. Honestly, the light saber battle at the end of the movie is the only exciting part in the movie. This film has it all, plot holes, awkwardly written dialogue, and overall, just not enough going on to keep your attention. I honestly think that this film was just made for a quick buck, and to sell a bunch of toys. Avoid this film, watch episodes 3,4,5, and 6. Those are the good ones.",0
3039,8.0,"This film, the first in the star wars saga. Has had a lot of different people saying a great many thing,about the child friendly characters, the lack luster performances by the actors. But what we as viewers have to understand is this is just the first chapter. Unfortunately we as a public were only able to read the last three chapters first. We were placed in a world already thought of, already in full swing. As a viewer I didn't have huge expectations when i went to see this film. I was excited, I simply thought of it as finally reading the beginning of a book that I loved as a child. The worlds were new and exciting the scale was very large but as with all movies repeat viewings always brings better understanding. The way Palatine effortlessly guides the queen and the senate to bring himself one step closer to power is amazing and the fact that (GL) came up with it himself is a testament to him and the reason he is the one in sky walker ranch and we are sitting in our apartment giving our reasons for weather or not we like or dislike his films",1

3041,6.0,First off i wish everyone would leave this movie alone. OK yeah its not as good as episodes 4-6 and Jar Jar Bink's just needs a punch in the face but lets just forget about all that. Instead lets look at the good points. The start of this movie is amazing. Up until Obi-wan and Qi-gon go down to Naboo. Then OK yeah its starts to suck a lot and the less said about the pod race the better. But when you get over that you have to see that Qi gon jinn is one of the best Jedi in any of the movies. And Darth Maul is just amazing. I just wish i could go back in time (like almost every star wars fan) meet up with George Lucas and make him re-write almost all of it and for god sake don't kill Darth Maul! Come to think of it what was the point in doing that? He could have done the same job as Dooku and done it better in episode 2. Rant over,1
3042,6.0,"Shortest review ever: Decent story, really poor writing.... Lines are super weird almost everytimes someone talks.",0
3043,6.0,This movie is poor. It is so out of line with the original trilogy from the beginning the opening scene like 75% is really boring and the title crawl should make fascinated to see what happens but in this movie it leaves you confused. Some of the CG worlds are cool but you can't develop characters from 12 different worlds. Jar Jar Binks drives me round the bend and it is quiet long. Padme is so plain and boring and you really couldn't care less if she died or not Obi Wan and Qui gon have good chemistry it is a shame that Qui GOn dies. Darth Maul has potential to bve a massively cool villain but they give him no character time and I think he is just there for the awesome duel at the end. Jake Lloyd is very annoying and the pod racing isn't exciting because you don't care about any of the characters. Overall boring with 1 cool scene.,0
3044,7.0,"I like this movie but I admit this movie have many defects like<br /><br />The scene that the Anakin fix the pods during the race, in this scene the Anakin could fix the pods using the force, the scene of midicloreans is useless they didn't showed the *power* of Anakin",0
3045,1.0,"I don't rate this movie as an awful movie in order to bash it. This movie is simply bad, very bad, very very bad. I guess if that would have been the first of the series, the Star Wars series won't be such a cult. I felt I lost my time. The characters are boring. The bad guys have no charisma and die so fast. Jar Jar binks is probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie history. The pod race is looooooong and never ending. Even the special effects look fake. Well, what there to save the movie ? Seriously nothing... I didn't even want to experiment the following episodes... I might try them someday as I've heard they are not as bad, but don't lose your time with this one.",0
3046,10.0,"I am one of the biggest fans of Star Wars.  I really mean it, Star Wars can do no wrong, in any way, shape or form.  The Phantom Menace is by far the biggest and best in the series so far.  It is an important film in the series for it sets up the events in the next five films of the series, and it pulls this off wonderfully.  Contrary to popular opinion, the story is not weak, in fact it is the strongest so far.  Finally, we get a little background in the origin of the Force and of how the Jedi are chosen. There is political corruption, even though non die hard fans will miss this plot point.  This is a film for the fans, not the critics or people who only give Star Wars a passing gaze.  The effects, while in abundance, do not distract from the story and the action.  The digital characters are in a word, amazing.  You really feel that Jar Jar and Watto are right there with the human characters.  The only loose link is Jake Lloyd.  While he does pull off the role of idealistic 9 year old boy quite well, his deliverance of some of the dialogue (Yipee!!) leaves much to be desired.  He is to this installment what Mark Hamill was to the original films.  But if you're only concern is the acting, go watch a Jane Austin movie.  This film was fantastic.",1
3047,5.0,"This movie, while OK, fails in one major respect:  It's attempt to add something for the kids, added items that most adults find irritating  Also, looking back, ""A New Hope"" seemed to be targeted at the16-30 age group, while this one seems aimed primarily at elementary kids.  One final note:  This segment also seems to have the least dialog and most time filling eye candy FX of the series.",0
3048,8.0,"This is another great movie from Lucas.  He has again given viewers a chance to forget about real life and enjoy two and a half hours of bliss. Phantom Menace begins to play out the story of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan while setting the story for the following two movies.  A slow start but quickly moves into a fast paced, exciting trip of fight scenes, visual effects, and beautiful worlds.  Much of the movie, I was just in awe of the scenery and characters that Lucas has ""invented"" in his mind.  The planet of Naboo was incredible to say the least and the new look at Tantooine is amazing. The new characters were refreshing with some being funny and some being quite strange and new.  The acting was weak in a few places but got increasingly better as the film moved on.  Overall, I thought the movie was great and will definitely go see it again (maybe just to try to get a glimpse at the 3 E.T.s in the senate).  Go see knowing you will have fun and experience a great overall visit to the theater.",1
3049,2.0,"Phantom Menace has a fairly good story, and there are specific scenes that rival some of the greatest in history, but as a whole it just comes off as an average movie with exceptional effects. This is mostly because the new characters Lucas cuts into the screen time of well-known ones are completely uninteresting. The original trilogy's characters were instant classics, Han Solo and his down-to-Earth wit, Leia and her femininist spark, but the new additions, from Qui-Gon to the young versions of the folks we know and love, seem to just be filler material to tell the story. Not one character besides the infamous Jar-Jar is memorable; Darth Maul only has three lines! Nevertheless, this is a fun addition to the movies, with lots of bonuses for SW buffs--thing everyone wanted to see, or at least *I* did--double-edged lightsabres, ample-breasted female Hutts, and Tuskan Raider cameoes. It's not worth a 20-year wait, that's for sure.",1
3050,10.0,"Phantom Menace is a great movie and I encourage any one to see it. This movie, like the original 3 Star Wars movies, is a fantasy tale with the same light-hearted spirit we all loved as children. It is a shame that many Star Wars fans have grown-up and forgotten what is was that made Star Wars fantastic. Phantom Menace follows the traditional Star Wars formula and is not an adult- action movie. It is a movie made for the child-at-heart and the wildest of our imagination. Phantom Menace is just as strong a movie as is any of the originals...Do I prefer the Episodes 4-6? ...yes, of course but I am not at all disappointed at Episode 1.",1
3051,10.0,"Forget all the people poo-pooing this movie, I thought it was great! What I can't understand is how everyone is saying that the characters are not fully realized or that they're cartoonish and stiff. Did anyone SEE the original Star Wars? Everything being said about Phantom Menace could be said about Star Wars.",1
3052,10.0,"Critics (and fans alike) have really been ripping this movie apart, analyzing every nuance of the film, and generally, given it something of a bad rap coming out of the gate.  I think the special effects were incredible, this was a breathtaking film visually.  The new characters are great, I can see a lot of potential for them in the next two films - particularly Ewan MacGregor's Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman's Padme/Queen Amidala.  I will concede that Jar-Jar probably takes some getting used to... I don't think the acting is dry in the least, nor do I think the story is farfetched - although conception plotline is a bit of a headscratcher, but the great and powerful George will reveal all in due time.  Instead, it's everything Lucas promised: a solid background on the events of Episodes IV - VI, seamless computer generated effects, another brilliant score from John Williams...in general, a fabulous moviegoing experience.  The major lightsaber duel at the end was probably my favorite part - all the elements (music(!), imagery, acting, dramatic tension) came together beautifully.  It does stick close to the format from A New Hope, but hey - if it a'int broke, don't fix it.  I think people are taking this whole thing too seriously - don't nitpick the film to death.  Just sit back, and enjoy the ride.  And if you can do that - you'll have a damn fun time.",1
3053,,"I went into this film with mixed information. Some people had said it was fantastic, whereas others had described it as a travesty to the other three Star Wars films. There were good points and bad points, this I will admit: however, I feel the former far outweighed the latter.",1
3054,9.0,"If you're looking for deep philosophical meaning, see an old Bergman or a Fellini film.  However, if you want a good, old-fashioned, Saturday-morning serial with thrills, chills, spills, and a galaxy of interesting and entertaining creatures, see the Phantom Menace.  The Star Wars saga was, is, and I hope always will be comic book science fiction rendered with state-of the-art cinematic technology.  Congratulations, George, on bringing us another wonderful installment in the trilogy of trilogies.  Make the jump to light speed, and bring on Episode II.",1
3055,7.0,"Visually speaking, The Phantom Menace is a breath taking film.  There were scenes that triggered my fear of heights,and the CGI characters were some of the best I'd ever seen.  (Though not quite photo realistic. Have to wait for episode three I believe.) The plot is the weak point of this film.  George Lucas doesn't really do a good job of explaining the background.  As a result, the film feels more like the first chapter of a long book, than a complete movie.  If you've read all the comics, and novels, you might understand the background.  That's not good film making, however. Despite the lack of background, Jar Jar Binks, and a major plot loophole at the end, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace.  When the credits rolled, I still wanted more, and to me, that's a sign of a good movie. I would rank it above Return of the Jedi, but below Star Wars, and Empire Strikes Back.",0

I saw the second show on the second screen at 10:30 AM on the opening day. The movie was totally awesome. George Lucas really did come up with all the stuff in the movie exactly how he wanted it when he couldn't before with the original trilogy. (Not including the Special Edition trilogy) Lucas has made the whole movie very interesting for all ages to see. There were a lot of computer animation in the movie which were very realistic. I agree that Jar Jar Binks is  whiny , however he wasn't as whiny as C-3PO was in the original trilogy. I was totally amazed at how Lucasfilm, Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound put together all the special effects and sound effects together in the movie. I'm amazed how they all blend together. I'm NOT disappointed with Lucas' work in 'The Phantom Menace' as I totally disgree with the movie critics. I say that this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy.",1

3064,9.0,"The Phantom Menace is a technical breakthrough in movies, with visual splendor as its main thrust. No one who has seen this movie can deny that the special effects are stunning, and the best part about it is most of the time the computer generations go unnoticed. The viewer just accepts them as completely real, as if Gungans and droid warriors have existed all the time.",1
3065,9.0,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. It borders on great at times. But it's no Star Wars (ep. 4). It's a LucasProduct, and holds up to those lofty standards...and yeah, the special effects were spectacular, the lightsaber duels with Maul were most impressive, as were the pod race and space battle sequences. But the first 20 minutes left me wondering if I'd wandered into some strange Star Wars/Muppet Show bastard hybrid. The aliens in particular were extremely hard to understand in some scenes that you couldn't read their lips as well. Is it kid friendly? You bet your ass it is. Definite PG, not PG-13... which is fine, but it seemed a bit light on substance and, uh, pathos? It's hard to feel sympathetic for countless scores of robots getting shredded. *BUT* for all that...it's a solidly *good* movie. (but NOT great...only parts of it are.)",1
3066,5.0,"Going to see The Phantom Menace was at first exciting, but after the movie I felt rather disappointed. The script wasn't written well, and all the jokes were completely flat. In the beginning at least you could try to stifle a giggle, but later you yawn and wait for the flick to end. Obviously every outcome is laid out in front of you even before you sit down in the theater if you have seen the other three episodes. Once all the characters have been introduced our pre-introduced, you may as well predict what they will do. The special effects are stellar, though, showing what movie-makers are capable of showing. Originality has almost disappeared in this movie, and basically every alien has some similarity with anything else on TV or anywhere else. Personally I felt a bit uncomfortable for a rather foolish reason when the ""big battle"" was taking place with all those fancy ships and blasters. Where were the X- and Y-wings? When were those AT-ATs going to show up? The events of this movie obviously take place before all those well-known ships and objects were invented, but the ""old"" vehicles look pretty neat too. Episode I is the perfect example of how a prequel sets the stage for the rest of the acts. The end partly pulls you along into the fourth Episode, and the entire story line just flows. In the first Star Wars movie, the old characters who appear in Episode I actually tell of tiny things that actually happen in this film. The saga is truly shown and expressed, but without the heart and laughter as in the first movie. I feel Lucas is losing his touch, and I won't be surprised if Episodes II and III would be complete failures. The magic of Star Wars seems to be disappearing, and this film is the proof.",0
3067,10.0,"The special effects in this movie, by far the best ever to be produced, merely support a quality plot and acting.  The only part where special effects move beyond their bounds is with Jar Jar Binks, who, although he was an excellent technical achievement, could have been toned down a lot without losing anything important from the movie.  Other than that, the plot was very involving, and even though it moves along several different paths at first, they all come together at the end and set the stage for Episodes II-III.  The acting is really quite good also, despite what the so-called professional critics say.  Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman all give powerful presences to their respective roles.  Although many little-kid actors come across as fake and obnoxious, Jake Lloyd gives a good performance as the young Anakin.  His lines do not sound forced, and they are realistic for what a nine-year-old would say.  And to all the people who think that Anakin does not act ""special"" enough--HE ISN'T SUPPOSED TO!!! The whole point of his downfall is that someone, even someone as kind and normal as Anakin, can stray down the dark path.  The menacing acting for Anakin will be left to the next two movies.",1
3068,10.0,"Though almost all movies hyped as much as ""The Phantom Menace"" are bound to be disappointing, this movie actually delivers.  The acting had been criticized as flat in initial reviews, while it was actually very involving, and similar to the style in episodes IV-VI that made them so popular.  The critics should remember that episode IV got bad initial reviews as well. The special effects are obviously king here, and they are spectacular; however, the acting keeps the movie going.  There was never a dull moment, and despite the somewhat-on-the-long-side length of ""The Phantom Menace,"" (130 minutes) I never once found myself looking at my watch.  Do not go to this movie expecting a life-changing experience, but it is definitely worth going to as a very entertaining and well-made movie, sure to break all kinds of box-office records.",0
3069,7.0,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. there story was basic but complex at the same time, and they explained the story very well. There actors were awesome I think Obi-Wan did the best acting but that is my opinion. The special effects were one of the best I have seen in a movie, they did a great job with the lightsaber and the blasters looked awesome too, and the droids were really realistic. The fight with Darth Maul looked so cool. Also again with the fish in the planet core were really well done. The fight in space with Anakin was really cool to see.This movie makes you fell like your there when Quigon dies you can actually feel anger toward Darth Maul.",1

The story was not very compelling, there were far too many digital effects, the actors were rather stiff, and Jar Jar Binks was the most annoying creature ever concocted for a motion picture.",0

I was in a galaxy far, far away...kind of fun to get away every once in a while.  I had read some reviews and was afraid I was going to be disappointed... but alas... I was not!!!  The special effects were awesome. Even Jar Jar Binks wasn't as bad as we had heard.  I do recommend you be up on your Star Wars history or it may not make sense.

I am used to my generations average action movie which is good guys blow up all with no story, 1000 curses sex and the chopping off of someones head along the way. This movie is Star Wars. The same magic as was in 1977. It has a great story, fantastic charcters and unbelievably real and jaw dropping special effects. Everything is great. I especially love the connections. I love how Palpatine calls Anakin ""YOUNG SKYWALKER"" and Qui-Gon discusses point of views with young Obi Wan. A subject Obi Wan will teach Luke later.

Thinking how good the first Star Wars movie back in 1977, using very limited technical gadgets and computer technology, everybody was expecting a spectacular new movie that'd replace its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, Lucas has done a fine job.  From the very first scene until the end credits perpetual action engulfs the viewer.  All CG characters interacting with actors/actresses are flawless.  Yet, you can not help but feel there's something missing. The Phantom Menace is a good movie.  However, Lucas could have focused a little more on the plot rather than the action.  Comparing TPM to old trilogy, I wish there were more scenes where Darth Maul showed up and said something (Darth Vader was almost always under the spotlight). Shortly, I'd rate this one 7/10.  A feast for eyes and ear but not for mind...",1

Lucas has provided us (SW Junkies) with an overwhelming amount of facts, trivia, and information. Those of you who are not the undying fans mentioned above, will no doubtly be highly disappointed.  It is not the ""Best Picture"" nominated movie we have all seen and know.  It is the unfortunate product of over-publicity. It is quite probable that in the most remote corner of the Artic, word has reached of this long-awaited movie.

I don't want to get into the whole it was made for kids argument because I enjoyed it and I am only a kid at heart. It's true the effects are over powering but really they are needed for a movie of this caliber to drive points across.

This is of course my humble opinion and I welcome yours.,1

The first had characters you cared for, great music, humor, and action.  This one does have action, but the other qualities are missing.  The best attempt at humor is a lame fart joke, and a character stepping in animal droppings.  The most telling aspect about this film's humor is the fact that I did not hear one good laugh from the packed house during the entire movie.  A couple of isolated chuckles, but no laughs.   Next, there are no characters you care about.  Obi-wan, Anakin, and the queen are mildly interesting, but they are not developed. Finally, John Williams' music is barely heard.",0
3090,10.0,"Hmm, that about says it all. I was so very disappointed that this movie was not better. George Lucas relied too heavily on CGI rather than actors. Don't get me wrong, the actors did well for the little parts they had, but it was not enough to keep me interested in this movie. I thought it dragged on and on and on, I was just waiting for the movie to pick up. Which it did a little in the end. The worst and most nasty and awesome bad guy that we have ever seen hardly has a role in this movie. Give me a break! We could have definitely used more of him. And I don't even want to go into Jar Jar Binds and his ""language"". I don't exactly appreciate going to see a movie and not being able to understand but three words every five minutes a character talks. There was no real story line behind this movie, and what little one it had was a little complicated to follow. All it was was George Lucas' way of saying ""look, I made another movie, go stand in lines forever and pay homage to me"".  But all in all, there is no way that TPM will ever live up to the reputation and the hype that was put before it. Maybe the same thing will happen with this trilogy that happened with the 1st.

YES! Not a great sci-fi film as such, just a good one, but then none of the Star wars films is great just by itself.

The movie had two strikes against it before it came out - we know the ending which makes it somewhat predictable, and it has a huge bill to fill.

Every decade must have its epics - the moral (Dances with Wolves, Schindler's List), the political (Nixon, JFK), those esoteric and rich beyond reduction (Heat, Kundun, The Thin Red Line). Now the 90s has an epic that truly is suitable for all ages and is the crowning achievement of the decade in science fiction and adventure. This movie is not about professional film criticism mind you- established circles have thrown out dampeners on this gem as predicted. But for everyone, this film is personal -either you believe Lucas has done it again or you don't. I love this film - an epic vision of wonder it would take an eternity to lose.",1

After seeing the Phantom Menace I left the theater feeling satisfied and anticipating the release of episode 2 more then ever.  One major criticism I have is that the special effects should have been tamed down at the start of the movie.  The effects should have been very progressive and built up, this would have made the decline even more amazing.  Some critics have said Jar Jar Binks is one of the major down falls of the movie, I disagree.  He is such a minor character (yet not so minor if you pay attention to the plot) that he could never ruin a movie of such grand proportion.  Jar Jar is a good and humorous character, who although adds quite a bit of goofiness at times serves his purpose.  Perhaps we should learn to deal and cope with JarJar as the characters in the story do.  Very strong performances by Neeson and McGregor.  Portman also shows some very promising acting skills, I hope to see her in some future roles (she sure is cute =) ).  While on the other hand, Jake Lloyd could have used a little more coaching in his deliverance of certain lines which came out quite artificially.  We must take into consideration his young age and inexperience and we must also note that he looked the part and played certain scenes very well.  Speaking of scenes, the pod race and final sword fight scenes were awesome! My adrenaline was going full throttle as I rooted for the good guys and hoped for the best.

3114,10.0,"Wow! The movie was simply incredible. While nothing could possibly ever live up to all the hype that has surronded this movie, it comes quite close. The special effects are, as expected, amazing. The first twenty minutes did drag a little but after that the movie really took off. The final few scenes were really incredible and tied the whole movie together quite nicely. This movie is a little different than the others in the saga thus far, in that the plot is more complex and involved which may turn off some viewers. Overall though it is an excellent first episode and really fits in with what Lucas has already done. I can't wait for the next two parts!",1

And i feel sorry for the people who spent weeks sleeping out side of cinemas and stuff.I'm a great fan of the previous films (a new hope,empire and jedi) but this film wasnt up to that standard.

I went to this having heard bad reviews  I figured it would be okay but not anything special, well now I've seen it four times, try and guess what I thought of it.  It's not the best I've seen but it is a great film to go and watch.  You just have to forget that the computer effects make it seem as though the technology is decades past ""A New Hope"", that was the main problem I had with the film.  This last time I saw it I thought of something, the movie never says anything about Uncle Owen who was Lukes fathers, you know Anakin's, brother.  Listening to things in A New Hope it sounds like Owen didn't think it was a good idea for Anakin to leave Tatooine, but Owen was nowhere in PH when Ani left.  So those two things, plus there is probably other stuff but these are what I've thought of, could make the movie seem bad.  You just have to remember its a movie and movies have mistakes, you just have to say so what.  If you do and if you liked the old movies or you just like cool action sequences you'll like this movie.  Well now I have to talk about those cool action sequences.

But the characterizations and situations--the fundamental emplotment--seemed inexplicably dull and plodding. It was a problem that begged an explanation. At first, I attributed it to simple fact of a middle-aged Lucas returning to the jejune vision of 20 years ago, unable to breathe life into these tired forms.

The script failed to provide a decent vehicle for the actors as well as a reasonable storyline for the viewer. True Star Wars fans will probably have had their hunger satiated for a while.

Second, since the wars and Galactic Empire came later, we are faced with a universe still living in some what peaceful times. The costumes and ""sets"" were wonderful.  Liam is the perfect Jedi Knight and Ewan the perfect choice for a young Obi-Wan.  Natalie was tremendous as the Queen and as Padme, you will see  why she is considered to be such a great talent.  The only problems I had were, Jake, little Anakin, and the character of Darth Maul had the potential to be a villain that would put Darth Vader to shame, but he isn't put to use like he should have been.

Well...he did, with help. Having been a lifelong and avid fan of the series, I did put a lot of weight on my first viewing of ""Phantom Menace.""  On my second viewing, however, I had already tended to a lot of my first-round wounds and found myself able to actually sit back and appreciate the enormity of visual and audio details...for a while at least.  My complaints had remained intact. First and foremost, Jar Jar Binks ruins every frame of the movie he appears in.  Flat out.  Period.  He never works.  He pushes you away from the film and upstages every live-action character he comes across.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor must have been kneading their foreheads when they finally saw who they were actually talking to in the final cut. Secondly, however random the conception of Anakin Skywalker truly is, it might have been able to come across as kind of cool. Might Have.  However, it's handled in such a blase' fashion (a careless and dull delivery of the goods by mother Skywalker), that we can't help but react to this discovery with: ""huh?"" Also, I understand that not all 6-year old kids are Robert DeNiro, but Jake Lloyd?  This kid will grow up to be Darth Vader?  Agreed, that's a heck of a lot of weight to put on any kids shoulders, but this was a national search...wasn't it?  Not all of it was his fault, he was given WAY to much random stuff to say, i.e. in the final battle: ""uh, let's turn left!"" and ""let's try spinning, that should do it!"", etc.  Once again: ""huh?"" I'm realizing that I could go on for hours, but I'm running out of space.  I can assure you, very few people wanted to like this movie more than I did and I pray for redemption in Part II.  My suggestions would include the complete exemption of ANY Gungan characters and the possible re-instating of Lawrence Kasdan to rescue us (again) from Lucas' dialogue.

There's a saying that's been around in the computer industry for some years: Garbage in garbage out.  No matter how good a computer and computer program you have, if your data is worthless, your output will be worthless.

I have always been a Star Wars fan and believe me, I really wish I could say it is, but it's not; in fact it's not even the best Star Wars movie (That title goes to Empire).  The special effects and battle scenes are the best I've ever seen, but the movie doesn't elicit the same awe and wonder that the others did.  Lucas didn't put very much thought and effort into the story; the whole plot was basically about a trade dispute, and it didn't seem like there was as much at stake as in the earlier films. The actors don't get much of a chance to develop their characters, which is part of what made the first three movies so enjoyable.  Jar Jar Binks has got to be the most annoying one in all 4 films, I mean I really hated him. You can tell Lucas put him in there for the kiddie appeal.",0
3136,8.0,"The special effects were awesome and the storyline was good; but The Phantom Menace only serves to make you hungry for more.  It has many of the things you come to expect in a Star Wars movie:  blaster battles, a light saber duel, and a space fight to destroy a base.  But it is light on the character development.  There's plenty for Annakin Skywalker; we learn he has an affinity for machines.  He builds a pod racer and C-3PO from scrap parts (yes, ""the"" C-3PO), and quickly learns to operate a space fighter on the fly.  Some of Annakin's mysterious origin is revealed, as well as the fact that he is the ""chosen one"" spoken of in Jedi prophecy, but we have to wait for the whole story to unfold.  The rest of the characters, however, are a little on the shallow side.  Amidala is revealed as a strong young leader, Obi Wan is the headstrong Jedi youth, and JarJar is just plain clumsy. Senator Palpatine is shone to be a manipulative bureaucrat, who claims he's not, and we're given a glimpse of the evil Emperor that the audience knows he will become.  Darth Maul's character is especially lacking.  He seems to be put in the movie simply because the movie requires a major villain.  He speaks more in the TV commercial than he does in the whole movie.  He never says a word to the heroes; he simply tries to kill them.  Although Darth Maul's look and attitude are very cool, I wish he had more personality to him.  The light saber battle between Darth Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Jon is excellent--very fun to watch.",1

Now i know this is a lame comparison but that is all this movie is supposed to be. An introduction to the starwars galaxy just imagine that you have never heard of DARTH VADER or LUKE SKYWALKER or HAN SOLO. If you do that i am sure you will enjoy this movie for what i think it was supposed to be. Now don't get me wrong i was at the movie theater for the 9am show and i have both copies of the trilogies and almost all of the original (1990's)toys.

Darth Vader is on the Dark side, right? Darth Vader use the 'force' to hurt others, right? Hmm, I don't remember any of that in my daily bible studies. So, according to the movie, and viewers making the same assumption as aga. somethings gonna happen in episodes 2 and 3 that's gonna make Jesus become part of the evil dark side.

I have a very hard time stomaching a movie that is trying to be very serious and then throwing out tons of one-liners.  The Mummy was a very good example of this. I am also not sure where all of these people are coming up with ""no story line"" or ""Weak Plot""?  I am guessing that these are the same people who enjoyed The Mummy or Armageddon?  Possibly two of the worst movies in history and have absolutely no story at all. The visual effects were awesome, again Lucas is way ahead of his time. The acting was again done very well.  I am very interested in seeing how Anakin will be taken to the Dark Side.  The only acting that I really had a problem with was that Jar Jar character.  Very annoying but friendly enough.  The Queen also did a very good job with her part. In my opinion with its few down falls, the rest of the movie was able to hold it up and I even forgot about the terrible slap stick lines.

I say so because anybody would say the same thing if they were 1/3 of the way through a movie and was cut off.  Remember, we can enjoy parts 4, 5 and 6 because we remember them as a TRILOGY.  So all those who say Episode I is a disgrace to Star Wars may be excused due to their IGNORANCE!

3159,6.0,"While this movie had some of the greatest special effects I have ever seen, specifically the mind blowing ground battle scene and the now famous pod race, it lacks the depth of characters that the first three were built on. While the special effects in the first movies are obviously somewhat lacking by todays standards, the movies were extremely entertaining because they were character based.  Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia are household names, and when you watch those movies you care what happens to them and you understand them.  On the other hand, the characters in the Phantom Menace are horribly underdeveloped, with no background and horrible dialogue.  The acting is somewhat lacking, although I felt that this had more do do with the lack of good dialogue than poor performances.  Darth Maul, essentially this movies Darth Vader, says maybe three lines in the entire movie, and barely and background is given on him other than some cryptic tie he has to the emperor.  The light saber battles, a hallmark of the franchise, are much better choreographed with the larger budget and whatnot, but they lack any emotion what so ever.  Not a word is spoken during them, not even a grunt, scream or yell.  What really made the light saber battles in the first movies entertaining was the dialogue, showing Lukes true hatred for his opponent, and the paradox that with every swing he turns to the dark side.  In this movie, the saber battles seem forced, with no reason other than the opponent is the bad guy.  However, while it seems as though I am tearing into this movie, I did actually somewhat enjoy it. The special effects are great, and the story is convoluted, but decent. The space battle and the ground battle are both superb, as is the pod race. If I wasn't expecting something of Star Wars calibre I would have enjoyed it, but more like a god action movie than a true space adventure/drama.",0

Then, the first thing I've heard was from my 13 years old brother saying the movie was nothing more than an insult to his intelligence(in french). The truth is that the movie was purely a mix of things that worked well in episodes 4,5 and 6 as a result, a movie made for less than ten years old, filled with plates, easy jokes (witch are not funny at all) and characters made to sell stuff at McDonald.  I just feel angry against the big Star War fans saying this is the best movie of all time.

I won't give away the ending, but the light saber battle between Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan and Ray Park's evil Sith Lord, Darth Maul, is easily the most exciting sequence in any of the four movies. It has martial arts, people catapulting themselves with the force, a fall down a giant pit, and both sides of the force. As soon as this movie is over, you'll want to yell ""Play that scene again!"" to the guy in the projection booth. Trust me (wave of my hand) ""You will see it again.""",1

I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone, so I won't be specific. It was a fun ride, and I don't believe it deserves some of the negative buzz I have been hearing.

I called the film one of the worst films id seen. Two weeks later i decided to go and see it again in a sober frame of mind. What a difference.I REALLY , REALLY enjoyed it second time around. I put this down to the fact that the first time i saw it i  was really looking forward to seeing Darth Maul, and i kept willing the movie to hurry up till i saw him.

Our memory of the thrill Star Wars created in us as children is impossible to recapture once we've become adults.  Episode I is an excellent movie.  The plot is as entertaining as the originals.  The acting is better.  The special effects are better.  Don't listen to critics...this flick is worth it.  Don't even try to compare it to Episodes IV-VI.

3173,,"While the Phantom Menace was packed with action, racing and battles, I could find little else in terms of positive qualities. Each character had hardly any development (with Obi Wan Kenobi's dialogue basically repeating his master's commands, the mere three or four lines spoken by Darth Maul, the villain. There was no development nor direction toward the storyline of Episodes IV - VI other than blatantly obvious insinuations about the impatience of Anakin and the ambition of Senator Palpatine (later the Emperor in V and VI). The only thing that carried this film was the special effects. However, in my opinion, the constant string of explosions, blaster and light saber battles, and full scale war scenes were not the characteristics that made the original Star Wars movies. These elements were secondary to the beautifully created story, the world of Star Wars. In my humble opinion, George Lucas decided to create a blockbuster film with the production of the Phantom Menace, independent of Star Wars films. Instead he has developed a film overflowing with action scenes and brightly colored aliens, perfect for merchandising deals such as video games (already the Pod Racing game and regular Phantom Menace game are nearly completed). However, while it certainly does not measure up to my expectations or the standard of the Star Wars original trilogy, the Phantom Menace was one of the better films that I have seen in theaters in a while.",0

I should have had more faith in Lucas.  The special effects reaffirm ILM's holding on the market while the plot is thick enough to satisfy even the most die hard of Star Wars fan.  Although predictable, the Phantom Menace does not fail to succeed all expectations and sets up the two following prequels beautifully.  Darth Maul wasn't the Darth vader replacement I was hoping for, but who else could personify evil as well as Mr Skywalker Senior, even the devil has trouble.  People will look back on this movie, not for the billions that it will rake in the box office, but as a legendary conception, and one we've come to expect from George Lucas, especially in his directorial swan song.  A special mention should go to Rick Macallum who worked tirelessly throughout the film and should be praised justly. The acting is superb and although it is not a tense drama, you as the audience become intertwined with the story which unfolds.  Jar jar is also a humorous addition to the somewhat ill used R2-D2 and C-3PO, and will be welcome in the next two films.  The sense of grandeur is also there with the land tanks sounding incredibly dominating in THX, and are as good as any of the vehicles of war demonstrated in Star Wars IV-VI. John Williams produces another beautifully somewhat simply rehashed score, but it still manages to conjure up the spirit of what has become a religion to some.",1

Other than Ewan McGregor (Obi-wan) and Darth Maul who actually had fun, it was a disaster. Sorry, I didn't buy Liam Neeson as a Jedi. A total bad kids flick. The little kid did as good as can be expected. The direction was horrible in his case (and others). You can really tell who could and can't act in this flick. Yeah, you George Lucas. Instead of Star Wars the Space Opera, Lucas treated us to explaining the force. Won't say how, but was it really necessary? No. It was better as a mystical thing. The Pod racing idea was utterly ridiculous. Maybe because of all the CGI characters or whatever they were. Here's an idea: where was the suspense like Luke attacking the first Death Star? Shouldn't there have been any suspense other than wondering what in the heck Queen Amidala's next hairdo would be? The attack was bound to succeed. Could've been a nail biter though. Why did she have so many and everyone else have just like one? Queens are elected? C'mon! The first 3 films deserved great ratings.

Let's put this in perspective.  This movie will be constantly compared to its predecessors, which in my mind is a little unfair.  In all fairness, 'Phantom' should not be critiqued and analyzed and brought to the mercy of film critics until the series is complete.  Reason being is this movie was not meant to be a stand alone and therefore should not be judged as such.  Those saying that this film in not a Star Wars caliber movie are being a bit hasty.  When the prequels are complete we will see exactly how 'Phantom' stands and its actual potency as a 'begin all' film.  I think most true die hard Star Wars fans, like myself, will accept this film as that, an adequate starting point for more to come.  After all, the original Star Wars was mauled over by critics, and now we consider it to be a classic.  Give it time.",0

The Jar Jar character, however, has got to go!

I thought that overall the special effects were pretty darn good, but the computer-generated characters weren't the best.  I think part of the charm and general appeal of the original trilogy was the 'puppet-like' characters that were still realistic.  Just about every non-human character in this film were blatantly computer-generated, which I find tacky.  CGI for special effects is one thing, but for actual characters, that's just wrong.",0
3204,4.0,"In short: it stinks. Liam Neeson appears to be especially pained by the monotonously lame dialogue he has to speak, but all of the major characters seem to have no history, and no personality. The characters in the earlier series were always full of smart remarks, but none of that here, only the rather infantile humor of JarJar Binks. What's worse, there isn't even enough action to make up for the cardboard characters (and I'm being generous - cardboard at least bends). The final battle scene could have been great, but every time something gets going, Lucas cuts away from it. The devil-like creature Darth Maul has almost no lines, and we get no sense that he is truly evil. He shows up, does his light-saber thing, and that's that. Lucas should have shown us some scenes from his childhood where he tortures frogs and gives the other devil-kids wedgies, etc. I liked the first 2 Star Wars movies a lot, I thought the 3rd one was only ok, but it at least had some great battle scenes. This one is just bad.",0

But I think Lucas made the characters kind of cold for a reason. That is, this movie is a prep for things to come. What will Anakin's relationship be with Yoda, Mace Windu, or Obi Won? Or will there be one? Obi Won is a bit obvious. This film can only really be appreciated if seen as a so called prologue. So the bottom line is, was it worth the wait? Is it what the hype was? Well, for me it was, but I wasn't too sure what to expect, and therefore wasn't disappointed. For any Star Wars fan, this is a must see, and very good movie. A word of advice though. Don't believe what the critics are telling you. It'll will be different for every viewer depending on what they were expecting. And I think a lot of the true fans were expecting exactly what they got. Episode 2 is going to be real evil!!",1

It is also unfortunate that arguably the most interesting & engaging character (Jar Jar Binks) is a computerized creation.

The special effects were by far the best of any Star Wars movie so far, but the other elements seemed to cancel them out.  I understand that you can't expect great acting from a little kid, but little Anakin was a central part of the movie.  The annoying computer generated cartoon-like character that tagged along for the entire movie was not though.  His annoying speech and goofball antics were only mildly amusing, and became just plain stupid as time went on.  The pod racing scene and the Jedi fight scenes were very well done. The final outside battle between Federation droids and poorly armed natives had EWOK written all over it however.

In the movie itself, the story flows well, the action is fast-paced, and the special effects are used very well to enhance the telling of the story, not eclipsing the story.  Although this movie is a prequel, like the other Star Wars movies, this movie is complete unto itself, while still adding to the greater story.  All in all, this is yet another great achievement by George Lucas, and I expect more to come!",1
3224,10.0,"I have seen this film twice now. The first time I saw this movie I was a little disappointed. I thought it lacked the spirit of what is Star Wars. I was not even excited about seeing it again, but I had already purchased the ticket for the next night so I went, man I was glad I went. I loved the movie the second time around. I knew what to look for in the movie, and the over-all plot of the movie came screaming out at me. I must have missed it the first time around. I know a lot of people do not like some of the characters of the movie (ie. Jar Jar Binks) but he really didn't bother me that bad. Not even the first time I saw it. There are a lot of childish overtones to the movie, but the over-all plot of the movie is complex and really ties in the Star Wars element. I hate giving away spoiler, so I won't. Go see this movie, You won't be disappointed.",1

I loved it just the way I thought I would. I finally figured out the story line and the over-all plot of the movie.

Some say that the plot slowed down too much with the Anakin scenes and the Coruscant scenes. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is the action behind the action. It is much more fast and furious than the slowing-down of A New Hope. But, there is something I must say about the pace of this film that I will come to later.",0

Sure, the acting isn't the greatest, the directing is slightly shady at some times, and some of the dialogue was bad.  However you can't deny the joy of watching this film in the theater. For 2 hours and 10 minutes I was sucked into the Star Wars Universe and thought of nothing else.  Some felt disappointed with this film about the lack of how Anakin would turn to the dark side.  You have to realize that this is part of a trilogy and not all the questions will be answered.  Also, critics complain about there not being enough evil. Well, this was a more peaceful and happy time in the galaxy and the lack of evil will make it even more painful when you see how depressed the galaxy becomes in the control of the Empire.

The latest in the series, which is actually where the story is meant to begin starts with such a convoluted story scroll that really young audience members will be at a loss from the start and seems to thrust us into the middle of the story that already well on its way.",0

3240,10.0,"""The Phantom Menace"" has taken a lot of slack from the press since its release May 19, 1999, but I am very confident that in twenty years when the Special Edition is released, everyone will consider Episode One a noble edition to the Star Wars film family.  In fact, I believe ""The Phantom Menace"" to be the best Star Wars film yet.  It is full of subtlety and, contrary to many fans' opinions, is ripe with spiritual symbolism and metaphor.  I have seen it ten times now (in the theater) and with each viewing I puncture an additional subtextual layer.  It astounds me that the most prominent criticism of the film is its ""flimsy"" or ""childish"" plot. The plot is incredibly complex, far more complex than any other Star Wars film to date, and definitely too complex for the average child.  It took me roughly five viewings to fully understand the entire plot, that is, to really grasp the motivations behind Darth Sidious/Palpatine's political maneuverings.  However, the politics are only skin deep, so to speak, and underneath lies a vast spiritual symbolism which catapults the mythological nature of the Star Wars films to another level.  The planet of Naboo, with its two estranged civilizations of water-dwelling Gungans and land-dwelling humans, is a wonderful metaphor for the divorce between the mind and the spirit (""The Naboo think their brains are so big,"" says Boss Nass, the Gungan leader) which is threatening to tear our own civilization apart; indeed, this menacing inner phantom of disequilibrium can be found throughout the film and gives it its beautiful meaning.  I love this movie, as should every Jedi-at-heart who desires true peace and justice in the world.",1

Clearly, this movie was not designed for anyone more mature than a pre-teen. The actors were wasted. This movie invested in some of the finest acting talent in the world: Liam Neeson and Samuel Jackson are excellent actors who were wasted on a movie that was made for people who have probably never heard of them. Had I been ten years old this movie would no doubt be among my favorites. However, as someone who has progressed beyond adolescence, this movie was a great disappointment. Hopefully episode II will mature with the age of the audience that episode I was designed for.",0

There are just too many special effects, so much to where it is more of a cartoon than a movie.  The characters were not interesting. The Darth Maul character was almost pointless.  He barely said two words. He doesn't even hold a candle to Vader. This movie will make George Lucas an even bigger fortune, not because of what it is, but because of what the original series was.",0

We sit here and say Jar Jar is an idiot and sucks and that the movie is slow and this and that. Well let me say BRAVO George on your come back!  I liked this movie so well that I suggest it to anyone who has a lust for for adventure.  It is a stepping stone (or a foundation) to what will be the greatest story ever told.  We will tell our kids how we stood in line to see it.  Just like I did for Empire and Jedi.

Jake Lloyd was annoying, Jar-Jar was the same, only to the nth degree. Darth Maul was a no-show, Darth Sidious also.  You can bash the acting in Episode IV, but at least Han Solo was a roguish, wise-cracking character, and Leia was smart-alecky and brash.  Darth Vader had more than 2 lines of dialogue, and was quite scary.  As for those who say TPM is just setting up for the next two, how do you explain ANH?  That was a fun, enjoyable, self-contained story & movie.  TPM is nothing more than a merchandising vehicle.  Oh well, not very brief...",0

Sure, I liked Darth Maul's character, but about everything else was far from original trilogy. Oh, I did like the scenery too.",0

3251,,"Overall, ""The Phantom Menace"" is not the strongest installment in the StarWars saga. But just as well, it rates as a fun movie. When the new trilogy is complete, it will be interesting to see what type of pedestal this movie will be placed on. My hope would be that of a positive one. It sets the characters up very nicely for the next two movies. The movie could have used a lot less JarJar. Most of the JarJar slapstick/site gags felt too beneath Star Wars. Ewan makes the perfect Obi-Wan and Lian Neeson turns in a superb performance as rogue Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. As I've said before, Ian McDiarmid has captivating screen presence in his dual role. Natalie Portman does very nice in another dual role. Ray Park is vile and menacing and for the most part...mute. But the man is still a bad-ass. Pernilla August brings the movie some acting credibility with her take on Anakin's mother. Jake Lloyd turns in a decent enough performance as James Earl Jones...er, Anakin Skywalker. The special effects were top-notch all the way. My friend had some differing opinions on that, but does it really matter? THE BATTLE DROIDS KICK ASS! Sorry if I hurt anyone's ears... Of course, the only true way to understand this movie is not through some half-assed plot summary (i.e - all of the above) but to see the film for yourself.",1
3252,7.0,I felt the pod race was too long.  I think the movie and its plot will be better received after the next two films are released. The plot was too small for a movie.  For a man who should be making Star Wars because of his love of the story he sure includes a lot of commercialism and some of it detracts from the story.  The alien races seemed more childish than believable when compared to the first three stories.,1
3253,1.0,"The Phantom Menace could have been a good movie.  The drawback is that Mr. Lucas lost sight of what made the first three Star Wars films so good.  In the first Star Wars trilogy the films were based on characters and plot. The Phantom Menace, on the other hand, tries to rely entirely on special effects.  The plot isn't good and the characters are not developed at all. The only upside is that the back story to the first three films is being told.  This could have been done in many ways, and probably should have been done in some other way, instead of making a disappoinging film that takes away from the power of the first trilogy.",0

3258,7.0,"I went to ""The Phantom Menace"" to see how the story began and therefore I must say, George Lucas did not forget anything important for the following Episodes. But i was disapointed to see that the underwater world on Naboo was an animation which remembered at any point at a computer game called ""Schleichfahrt""(sorry, I don't no the english name)and I preferred that one. And the invasion troops where pure animation too. A film composed in the virtual reality and in this point a very good piece of work. But for a Star Wars Movie ""Episode I"" missed relationships as Chewbacca and Han Solo had, emotions as the Ewoks showed and something like the ""humanity"" of the storm troops, which means I always could imagine that the stories of Star Wars could become reality in a far away future, but ""Episode I"" seems to be virtual reality of our days.",1
3259,,"The Phantom Menace does not live up to the expectations of those (including myself) who have grown up on the first (or should i say last?) three films. George Lucas is much farther chronologically from the geewhiz innocence that went into STAR WARS, EMPIRE, and JEDI.  He has lost  much of his original zest for the series, I feel.  MENACE has all the fireworks,  all the noise, even some slambang action and machinegun humor.  But....where's the heart of the film?  For all of its sophisticated screenwizardry, the film seems as if it was churned out by a computer.  There are no quiet moments  (such as in the early family scenes on Tatooine in the first film.)  There are no scenes of true camaraderie or personal chemistry. (compare the indifferent, mechanical interplay between Obi-Wan and his master in MENACE  with the more human relationship of master-student between Yoda and Luke in EMPIRE ) and despite its title, is there ever a moment in THE PHANTOM MENACE when we feel that our heroes (such as they are) are really up against an evil force that may or may not be able to be destroyed ?   Do we  ever really worry for them?   Coming out of the theater,  I noticed a group of boys playing a STAR WARS zap 'em video game.   I remember feeling that I cared about the characters in the film  PHANTOM MENACE no more than I did for the digital images that were moving in the video game.   Save your money and spend it on the game .  You'll walk away with just as much (or as little)  true emotions triggered, and you'll actually feel that you' ve gotten your money's worth.",1

I loved it -10 out of 10!!!!! The only real problem with the film was that it was no brakes, just action non stop. I guess the original story was weigh to long for one movie, so George Lucas just packed it extra tight together, but it worked. And I must say that Starwarsfans that got disappointed over this movie had just too big expectations, they was expecting a movie with the action of Ep 4, 5 and 6 together! Yes it was not the film that was wrong, but their expectations. At the end I would like to say that real fans are fans that love Starwars no matter what, in good and bad days! (even though this was a bloody good one)",1
3261,1.0,"The visuals in the movie were stunning, but nothing else was really worthy of remaining in my theater seat. It was hard to see any motivation behind any of the characters. They were simply there. Jarjar looked like a revival of Butterfly McQueen's character from Gone with the Wind, very sad in the 1990's. I find the future relationship between Amadala and Anakin especially creepy since she assumed a maternal role in this film. This movie seems like Lucas was trying so hard to keep secrets for the next film that he told us absolutely nothing. I rented all three of the previous films and enjoyed them greatly, so what was the problem here. Also, I'm curious as to Lucas' odd obsession with British actors, given that the other three films were principally played by Americans?!",0
3262,10.0,"Obviously, you aren't a huge Star Wars fan. You don't understand the importance of the characters, why they act the way they do, the importance of the Trade Federation and senator Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, and anything else you found boring. You have to understand that this is the first chapter of the 6 part saga and it is merely an INTRODUCTION. this means that bigger events are setup and characters are still mysterious so later on they aren't boring and useless. George Lucas has said that things will start to get rolling in episode 2 and then in episode 3 all hell breaks loose. Episode 1 isn't a carbon copy of A New Hope (episode 4). It takes place in a peaceful time, the ""civilized day"" as an older Obi Wan said. Everyone is happy, the Jedi are in full control. But unfortunately, and phantomly (hehe, pun) things are starting to go wrong. The Jedi council are way to cocky and think they are invincible now. The republic senate is corrupt and falling apart. And the Force is UNBALANCED. These three issues will be solved in very different ways in Episodes 2 and 3 and even up to 6. The senate will regain integrity through Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's lies of a new and better order. Eventually he takes over the senate and declares himself Emperor. Secondly, the Jedi council will discover they aren't invincible and too cocky when they are hunted down and destroyed in the ""Jedi Purge"", headed by Palpatine yet again. Thirdly, and most importantly (hell, it's the focus of the entire saga) the Force will be balanced when Anakin destroys the Emperor and Luke goes on. Notice how important Palpatine is in this chain of events. Now, NONE of this could have happened in Episode 1 because it all happens over the course of 40-50 years. The characters need to be setup, not developed fully mind you and the surroundings and current status of the universe need to be established. That takes an entire movie, and it should, or the saga will truly suffer. Episodes 2 and 3 will be really heavy on character development and huge events occurring (clone wars is one of them).",0
3263,,George Lucas was once quoted as saying that he got about 50% of the desired effects that he wanted out of Star Wars:  A New Hope.  He recently said that he was 90% satisfied with his most recent creation: The Phantom Menace.,0
3264,10.0,"First of all, I have to say that I like the special effects very much. Here in Japan, some of the highest grossing movies tend to be effects films, sometimes films that don't even have a story. (like the recent Independence Day and Armageddon films.) Maybe because as Japanese, we find the captions (subtitles?) a little troublesome to read and want to just enjoy the visual experience.  In this aspect, I think that Star Wars 1 delivered. The pod races, the big battle between the Gungans and the Droids, the assualt on the Command Ship, we loved them all. Second, I think that I liked the light saber duel between Darth Maul and Jinn and Kenobi. It seemed interesting to me that while in the first Star Wars films, the fights were based either on european fencing (episode 4) or on Japanese kendo (episode 5,6), the fight shown in episode 1 was more like a hong kong action film using kempo or wu-shu. As I am a big fan of Tsui Hark and Jacky Chan films, this was fun for me. However, I was disappointed by the characters. I think that there were too many characters and not enough explanation. As I walk through bookstores here in Fukuoka, Japan, there are entire sections devoted to Star Wars books and periodicals, and some book stores even sell action figures! When I look at these figures, I see that some of the characters barely even appeared in the film! Instead, I think that the movie should have centered on the main characters, developing them a little more. For example, I want to know more about Qui-Gon Jinn, and more about Anakin's mother. Finally, I want to vent my frustration about Jar Jar Binks. When I read internet discussions about this character, I see that some Americans dislike him because of the racist image he portrays and the fact that his way of speaking is ""annoying."" For me, I didn't like him because I could barely understand his English. I lived for three years in America, in Florida, studying English, and I see any American film as a fun opportunity to practice my listening comprehension. However, watching Jar Jar Binks made me turn to the Japanese captions in frustration because I could not tell what he was saying. Here in Japan, we waited a long time to see this film. Our mass media has been depicting it as one of the greatest films to come out of America. (Partially because we think that almost anything that comes out of a big American studio is as good as gold) However, I think that I was a bit disappointed. But hopefully, Episodes 2 and 3 will be better, maybe?",0
3265,6.0,"This is what I call a ""movie for the deaf"" the greatest special effects I have seen (and I have seen many a movie), but then you have to listen to the dialogue.  Worst of all is Jar Jar.  I can barely stand to write his name because it brings on flashbacks worse than Vietnam.  When I saw the movie the first time I said wow at the special effects and wow at the horridness of Jar Jar.  I sat on the edge of my seat just hoping he would die painfully by the end of the movie.  And then I saw it again(For the special effects)and even though I knew the outcome I still sat on the edge of my seat hoping that Jar Jar's grizzly demise would come soon. On a final note If you are a diehard Star Wars fan you will like this movie no matter what I say and even if you're not a Star Wars fan it will still be a fun, enjoyable (with the exception of Jar Jar)experience.

I will try not to repeat those obvious ones(such as the griping over Jar Jar).  One thing I believe is worth mentioning is how astounded I was that Ewan McGregor actually portrayed Obi Wan to such great detail that I could swear he was kin to Alec Guiness.  When you watch, note how he carries himself, how calm his personality is(granted ALL jedi have this characteristic,however I believe Obi Wan to be the most calm and cool of all the jedi, even more so than Yoda whose old age and wisdom gives him the authority to be hyper(after all he is a muppet)).  This quality in Obi Wan was seen in the trilogy and I truly believe that McGregor kept the style close to the character already developed for him. Next was the Darth Maul thing...to all you Darth Maul fans...HE IS NOT A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!!  I cannot believe the hype over him, he was not in the movie long enough to determine how powerful he really was.  Also, I believe that his role was not to be this all encompassing butt-kicker that everybody wanted...remember at this point in the story the Sith want to remain ""on the D.L."" so that they can gain more power in the galaxy through treachery and deceit rather than out and out war...having said that, Darth Maul is an absolute joke...more like a sorry decoy than another, more in-shape Darth Vader.

Think about it, the characters, situations and dramatic turnovers are the same in both movies. Just look at this list: -A non-adult innocent boy, with a lot of force inside of him. I either pick Luke or Anakin. -A royal woman with an attitude. I pick Leia instead of Amidala because the first is much smarter. -A man who follows his own decisions, no matter who is against them. I prefer Han Solo rather than Qui Gon Jinn (Han can use a lightsaber, Qui can't use a blaster). -A sidekick who only mumbles a few sounds and is an excelent machine repairer. Chewbacca is a lot cuter than young Obi-Wan. If you think a little you can find more similarities , and maybe we can make a ""why is better IV than I"" list. Don't get me wrong, I love star wars , but I expected Episode I to be superior to A new hope, but when I saw it i remembered that Star Wars: A new Hope is the best movie ever made and no other film is gonna take off that title, not even one of the prequels.",1
3274,6.0,"As a fan of the first trilogy, I was rather disappointed by this effort. The Phantom Menace is really nothing more than a piece of adolescent fluff (albeit a looong one).  There is no doubt that the visuals are impressive (especially the exciting lightsaber duels), but one can't help but get the feeling that this computer generated imagery will date even faster than the models of the original SW (just look at Jurassic Park). In all, fun for the kids, but a disappointment for those of us over 16. Still, I probably should have known that no movie could live up to the hype that surrounded this particular release.",0
3275,7.0,"A solid film, with several big problems. Firstly Jar Jar is the most irritating character in cinema history (well, at least since Chris Tucker's last film role). This kind of brain-damaged Teletubbie-esque amphibian is obviously aimed at the kiddies, and makes all but the least cynical of adults grind their teeth with hate. But the kids in the cinema seemed to like him, and that's all that matters.",1

George Lucas had a nearly impossible job of trying to please a generation of fanatics that have grown up on Star Wars.  Prequels are rather difficult to pull off anyway, trying to tell an interesting story when the fates of the main characters are known.  I'll give him an A for effort, but a B+ for the finished film.

3279,10.0,"Star Wars was hyped more than any other film in history, and the expectations of this film were so high that if it were nothing less that a work of cinematic genius, the critics would slam it and say what a bad film it was, and instantly compare it to it's predecessors; I think that George Lucas provided us with a masterpiece. I went in to the Cinema, and was really excited when the opening credits began to roll, and from that point on, I was enthralled by what I consider to be one of the greatest films ever made. Lots of people have complained that the film got started far too quickly, and we were thrown in to the action too quickly. I have to disagree with this, as the quick opening and getting in to the film immediatly was a good touch for me. The characters were developed adequetly, but not so that we could know them inside out, but, afterall they are Jedi Knights, we're not meant to know them are we? Did we know all albout Obi-Wan in the original film? No. I also loved the fact that there were two Jedi Knights strolling around, and that almost everyone was terrified of them. That was a marvellous touch. The storyline for me was excellent, and people who say it was boring should maybe watch the film again, after watching the original trilogy once more. It was clear to me that all the way through, Senator Palpatine was The Emperor, and the film was telling how he maouevered his way in to power, and then used his power to turn to evil. It's a great set up for the next films(s) which is basically what this film was attempting to do, much as 'A New Hope' had done before.",1
3280,,"I am 26 and grew up with the holy trilogy, i loved the imagery and diversity of the star wars universe and couldn't wait for TPM. Having seen it, i can only wish Lucas had let a real Star Wars fan see this film and listened to his comments before letting TPM be released. We would have been spared the incredibly annoying Jar Jar Binks, the criminal under use of Darth Maul the coolest character in the film, the feeble plot ending (as if the battle droid UPS or whatever it was would be in the main hanger of the control ship) most of snot-nosed Anakin's dialogue ( YIPPEE!? )the use of stereotypes to identify characters ( Jar Jar, Watto, the Viceroy etc )and all the other merchandise pushing, dollar extracting mass appeal crap that he pumped into this film. George Lucas had 17 years and an unlimited budget to put this thing together, it should have been the ultimate evolution of the series but instead turned into a over-blown episode of the muppet show in space. I can only hope that Lucas wakes up tomorrow and realizes he can't direct to save his life. He then steps aside and hands the reins to a proper director for the next in the series to stop the rot and restore the real fans faith in the star wars universe.",0

Highlights: The beginning with Obi wan and Qui Gon fighting the droids(viceroys""we are no match for the jedi!!"")

Yes it may be a common place to say this but that character is so childish it ruined the whole script. As an Star Wars fan i felt disappointed because to me clearly George Lucas has ""Merchandising"" on his mind and as consequence all those stupid (and rip off from old movies)sequences had an target: Children.

I enjoyed Return of the Jedi the most out of the four, because it wrapped up the whole story, and all the pieces of this 6 episode sci-fi/adventure were finally complete. I think the role of Anakin Skywalker, could've been given to a little taller kid, then Jake Lloyd, after all he turns out to be 2 meters tall. The special effects were awesome, but I think they could've made SOME of the scenes realistic, most of it was blue screen.",1

The only problems with this movie is that Jar Jar Binks is in it and the Viceroy talks to funny. Jar Jar should not have been in it (i know that this movie was targeted towards a younger audience). The viceroy and the others like him should not have spoken in funky accents. They should have been speaking in their own language and they should have subtitled it like Jabba. >waited for Obi-Wan to slice him in half. He put up such an awesome battle .

Even though the signs were there already in Return of the Jedi with the soft, cute and cuddly Ewoks, I was hoping for something less childish with the prequels, and the anti-climax was the muppet/freak show at the pod race where i got a strong feeling that the main purpose was to squeeze in as many ""funny"" characters as possible for the multi billion dollar action figure market, I guess the old enthusiasts doesn't spend enough money to be interesting enough to keep satisfied.",0

George Lucas had hinted for years that he actually had 9 movies in mind when he did the first triology and I could only dream of how amazing they would be when they were finally completed.  Well, the dream is definitely over.  Phantom Menace was just that - a phantom of itself.  the Star Wars universe has become one of the most richly defined sci-fi venues thanks largely to the efforts of some superior writers (I speak specifically of Timothy Zahn and am excluding Kevin Anderson).  I guess I got spoiled by them because I was expecting dialogue and plot along the lines of what has come before.  The acting is not the problem but Lucas' dialogue is just plain awful.  From the incessant chatter of Jar Jar to the stale interaction between Anakin and Padme there are no memorable lines or scenes here (at least ones that involve dialogue - the lightsabre duel is absolutely incredible spoiled only by the fact that we a forced to watch 2 other battles that we don't care about while it is going on-arrrgh!!

The Empire Strikes Back was less fresh, naturally, but no less exciting.  By the time of The Return of the Jedi, however, a distinct lack of originality had set in: the big climax: blow up the Death Star- Again! Worse, was the fact that the battle scenes were reduced to slapstick with those stupid Ewok-Teddy bear things, which completely undercut any tension these scenes might otherwise have generated. Lucas and the gang were obviously attempting to broaden their demographic base, to the detriment of the story.",0

If I was a child now, this movie would've made a difference to me. A lot of people have missed the point here. It's supposed to be a children's movie, but there's still much for adults to enjoy; The PodRace, the political shenanigans, the relationship between Qui-Gon and Shmi. I could go on, but there are so many great moments to enjoy. Ewan and particularly Liam are fine in their roles, and everyone does a pretty good job. Even the dialogue doesn't have you chewing your fists like 'Return of the Jedi' does. The self-parody, the set-pieces and the amazing effects make this a film to cherish. Take away all the hype, and you're left with one of the finest blockbusters of recent years.",1

Before the movie hit the theatres, I watched a download off some korean site on my computer, and thought it was cool. When it finally hit the theatre, my girlfriend and I went to see it after the initial rush for tickets had died down. In retrospect, the tickets to that movie weren't worth the paper they were printed on. She even fell asleep and although I seldom do that, I can empathise. The movie becomes unbelievably dull once you punch through the enormous barrage of sound and animation, and is simply not suited for repetitive viewing.",0

For all the Star Wars fans out there thinking this is the best movie ever, simply because it's Star Wars, think about what made the original trilogy classic in the first place.  Those elements are remarkably absent in Episode I.  Instead, the movie is nothing but a tiring repetition of special effects and idiotic jokes.  The mere presence of a character like Jar Jar Binks is inexcusable, let alone his role as a main character.",0

Now they are adults and still they expect the same rush. They don't seem to realize that they aren't 12 any more. I am a teenager, so I wasn't around for the originals. I watched them when they were released and I loved them. Now a year later, the Phantom Menace comes out and I loved it. It is because I am not expecting more than any movie can give. I went to this movie not expecting a miracle, but expecting two hours of fun and this movie delivered. People seem to want to watch the original again. Anything else won't be good enough. They have to realize that this is a different movie and a diffrent story. So no, there is no Han Solo, no Empire, no Princess Leia and no Luke Skywalker, but there is equally interesting characters and an equally interesting storyline. I recommend this movie to everyone!",1
3311,5.0,Nice special effects. Too bad the rest sucks so much. It's stuffed with Hollywood cliche's and the story (what story?!) is pretty much the same as stories of the old sequels combined. Jar Jar (probably for the kids) is really annoying.,0
3312,10.0,"It's amazing.  I am relieved and in wonderment as to how four related films can all be so wonderful.  Why did I give TPM a 10-rating? The reason is that what made the previous SW films so good action,story,characters,special effects return in full force with this edition.  We get to see how the Saga started...finally.  What we witness is an amazing story(or at least the beginning) that is a more than worthy start point to the greatest movie saga of all time.  Because the previous 3 films were so good TPM had to maintain that level of excellence.  It did.  New characters as Jar Jar and Darth Maul brought an added dimension and substance to the saga.  Older characters such as Obi-Wan and Anakin allow us to see them in their younger years and begin to piece together the mysteries of how they reached their states in the older films.  When the credits to TPM roll we are left with the film that has all the wonderful attributes of the previous SW films.  Can we ask for more?",1
3313,7.0,Exciting action scenes. Acting may not be good enough.,1

3315,6.0,"Some said the movie was too simple. In fact, the plot of Phantom Menace is a great deal more complex than any of the original three SW films. The simplicity of this one lies in the extraordinarily bland characters. In Phantom Menace, the good guys are really, really good and the bad guys are the baddest of the bad. I understand the whole ""not everyone is who they appear to be"" angle, but no one is especially interesting. On the plus side, this movie does exactly what it set out to do: it introduces us to the people who will be crucial in Eps II and III, and I for one am even more excited about them than I was before. Overall, this film was a disappointment, but I truly believe that ten years down the road it will have taken its place in Star Wars history.",0
3316,,"Before TPM was release back in 1999, I had so much hope and anticipation built up for this movie...I had always envisioned what had happened before EPIV-VI, but never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be so MASSIVELY disappointed.  First off...You would think after 16 years, Lucas could come up with some a little more interesting that a TRADE FEDERATION plot...WHAT is up with that?  Then, at least he could have cast someone with a little acting ability to play Anakin...instead we get a kid that yells ""YIPPEE"" every five minutes, and can't act if his young life depended on it. To make things worse, we get legendary WOODEN performances from Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor.  And why in the hell is Samuel Jackson IN THIS MOVIE???  I don't see a character...I see SAMUEL JACKSON....but the worst of all the worst is the most embarrassing thing EVER put onto the silver screen...JAR JAR FREAKIN' BINKS....This alone is enough to turn off even the most diehard SW fan...Why in Gods name did Lucas have to totally destroy the SW legacy with this thing?   What purpose does JAR JAR serve?.  Why does he talk like that?  The questions in my mind go on and on.",0
3317,5.0,"I loved the original Star Wars films. I am still a big fan of Star Wars. When I first watched  Star Wars Episode 1:The Phantom Menace, however, I was dismayed by what I saw. Jar Jar Binks (in my opinion) is disgusting, grotesque, and he destroyed the entire movie. Perhaps what disturbed me the most about the new Star Wars film was that it lacked originality and creativity.  Liam Neeson read his lines as if he were attending a funeral. I missed Harrison Ford, and I was constantly looking for a character in the new movie which I could identify with. The original Star Wars films had a heart; you were constantly rooting for the good guys (or for the bad guys). The new Star Wars film was full of empty platitudes.   If I had to give George Lucas one piece of advice for his new Star Wars film it would be: REMOVE JAR JAR BINKS FROM THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE AND CREATE FRESH, NEW ORIGINAL SCENES WHICH WILL EXCITE THE AUDIENCE.  I also have some advice for John Williams, who composed the soundtrack for the film (P.S. John Williams is my IDOL and my HERO. GOD BLESS JOHN WILLIAMS. What would the world be like without him?)  Here is the advice for Mr. Williams: INCORPORATE MORE OF THE ORIGINAL MUSIC FROM THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. The pod racer scene was perhaps the most exciting scene in the movie. The actor who played Anakin Skywalker seemed too young and it seemed to me as if he was reading his lines.  Please, Mr. Lucas, re-watch the original Star Wars Trilogy, and then review Star Wars Episode 1.  Perhaps you will see what was missing from the new film.  I will always be a fan of the original films, but I want to see another Star Wars film which I can add to my list of classics.",0
3318,,I saw this film in Dallas.  My expectations were extremely high and they were not met.  The young Anakin started to grate on my nerves as soon as he opened his mouth.

3319,7.0,"Well, folks. I'm still not sure what I should think about ""Episode I - The Phantom Menace"". ok, it is a good SF-Movies, but as a Star-Wars-Part? No. Not good. I'm missing the interesting features and scenes of the ""old"" three parts.  For sure many ideas in these three old movies were kind of stolen.....but Lucas built with own ideas a fanastic and amazing story. Now, in Episode I, he even stole ideas, scenes, from his first movies, but he did it very very bad. The conversations of the actors seem to be to formal, stiff. Some roles are just disturbing...yep, Jar Jar Binks....he is just anoying. And as a Star-Wars-Fan the most worst part is how George Lucas is handling the ""force"". Jedis are measuring the force by controlling the blood!?!?!?!?!? Oh Lord, thats against everything I saw in the old movies (relating to the force), read in Star Wars-Books or Comics.",0

There is only one point I can critise the film on and that is the ages Anakin and Princess Amidala are supposed to be, and how old they actually look.  The fact that in the next sequel they are to get together does seem rather stupid, but a lot of people don't agree with me on this. Other than that fact, the rest of the film is great, the musical score, the special effects and computer graphics.  The transporters with all the droids are brilliantly shown and the underwater scenes look amazing.  People that don't rate this film much are just sad and can't see the humour, fun and simplicity of the story, this movie is there to be enjoyed and seen as an escape from reality.",1

Jar Jar binks drove me so crazy that I had to change the channel every time his baby ebonic speak touched my ear.  I know the Jedi's are supposed to be serious, but heck, it was like the life was sucked out of them.  Could they possibly crack a smile? A smirk? I know Natalie Portman is a good actress, but what happened in this movie? She is more monotone than my 6th grade math teacher.",0

It is unfair to George Lucas, the three original films and to the prequel when people say that it is a bad Star Wars story.  That there was too much of something(Jar Jar) in it.  To compare the prequels to the originals is just unfair.  I knew that they weren't going to be the same. I didn't think that people would degrade it as much as they do.  All I'm saying is that it is wrong and unfair to think of it as an original Star Wars.",0

3327,1.0,"It took George Lucas almost 20 years and all he could think up was Jar-Jar, now that`s just dumb. The movie starts out good as the Jedis destroy a bunch of droids, but from there the movie just goes downhill and doesn`t get good again until the last half-hour. Just look at the scenes, Jar-Jar ruins every scene he is in. Making Star Wars look like some stupid slapstick flick and that takes away a lot from the epic saga that Lucas is trying so hard to make it in to. A couple of more examples: The pod-race was too long and that Anakin was able to win despite getting that late start was also stupid, Sebulba whom he was racing against(the others were dead meat, we all knew that from the start)was the champion of the planet and despite all of Anakins engine problems he still beat him. C`mon, we know the force is strong with him but he`s still just a kid. And look at the end where Anakin destroys the droid control ship, he just does it by pure dumb luck. It was never that easy when Luke destroyed the Deathstar in the original Star Wars. The only good thing about this horrible movie is the Light sable duel in the end. That Lucas could make this piece of crap remains a mystery to me.",0
3328,3.0,"This movie had the chance to be something really special, but instead it fell flat. Instead of creating this CGI world of technology far more advanced than the world we are shown in the original trilogy (even though it's set before those times!) they should have stuck with the same type of settings from the originals, it just doesn't mesh, it's like they are two completely different galaxies. There is plenty more I could complain about, such as jar jar binks, the absolutely mind numbing politics, the totally unremarkable whiny character they've built Anakin to be and reliance on the audience being just excited to see the new CGI versions of Yoda and Jaba that we forget the boring and inane plot, and the list could go on. But I will leave it there.",0
3329,5.0,"I think that the phantom menace is about how all the characters got in the fourth star wars movie together. For an example how r2d2 got to anakin or how cp3o got built. Though it might not have too much story to tell, it's a pretty decent movie. The only flaws that the movie has in my opinion is the political argument. It says about what is in the law and what isn't. Another flaw is Darth Maul. Darth Maul only fights twice. And I get that he isn't the main character, but still. I would love to see him in the second movie. An example is Dooku he appeared in the second and the third movie. But that's not the end. Jar Jar Binks is so annoying that it nearly killed me literally. Also the cgi is awful but I'll make i exception because of the 1990's . Over all the movie is normal.",0
3330,2.0,"The dialogue throughout ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is trite and banal. Liam Neeson's acting talents are wasted as is Ewan McGregor's (see ""Moulin Rouge"") in something that even the wizardry of George Lucas can't rescue. Instead of Liam Neeson's character, Qui-Gon Jinn, dying near the end, making way for Ewan McGregor's character, Obi-Wan Kenobi, graduation from a padawin (sic) to a full-fledged Jedi Knight, I think a more interesting plot would have involved the kidnap of the young Anakin Skywalker by the Dark Forces. Then, perhaps, the doubts of the Jedi Council as to Skywalker's having the ""Force"" within him, could have been united by their efforts to rescue him from his abductors.",0

Where  in the original 3 movies dialects were brilliantly created and much thought and time went into them, I found a lack of creativity, and depth in this movie.  It almost seemed that Lucas sold out to meet the needs of the ""norm"" instead of doing what he had such a gift for, creativity, and fresh ideas to push our imaginations to the absolute limits. How sad. On a lighter note, I found the characters of the queen, obi-wan, and Qui-Gon to be interesting and well thought out.I saw much potential in their characters. I think if Lucas had put more time into depth of story, and less time into flashy effects, the movie would have been much more successful. It is sad that in this day in age we have to find movie enjoyment in big showy spectacles, instead of using the best vehicle for that... our imaginations.",0

Maybe I'm just to old for these movies, but I just rewatched A New Hope (SW 4) today and it still kicks @ss. PM dropped the ball big time and unfortunatly never picked it up, even AOTC was bad, but this was horrible. Much like Godfather 3 almost ruined the Godfather trilogy (my all time favorite trilogy), The Phantom Menace almost ruined the Star Wars franchise. I was expecting a lot out this move, maybe to much, but even the story was bad. The only two redeeming factors are Natalie Portman and the Pod Races, Natalie brought style and grace to the Queen. The pod races were just plain cool and enjoyable, but the worst part of the movie, Jar-Jar. What the hell is the point of him, he's more annoying then Tom Green. Out of 10 I gave the PM 3/10, and I hated to do it, but I hope Mr. George Lucas does a better job with the third film, hopefully more like ESB was, the best of the franchise.",0
3341,6.0,"First off, let me say that I don't hate Jar Jar as much as most of the people who review this film. I feel that most of the intrinsic problems with this film stretch way beyond pointless comic relief. That was more or less just thrown in to cover up the other problems. However, since we're on the subject, let me talk a little about Jar Jar. First off, yes, there is way too much Jar Jar in this movie and the fact remains that they could have easily cut most of his pointless antics out of the film. However, I don't feel that Jar Jar's character was pointless or that he should have been cut out of the movie altogether. Jar Jar represents one of the only archetypes that George hadn't used in the original trilogy - the joker. It totally understand George's intent in putting Jar Jar in this movie as its probably the only one with a plot line that would suit that archetype and if you think about it, not every character in his saga has a real purpose for being there, sometimes there just there for pure enjoyment's sake, and unfortunately Jar Jar's character falls flat where characters like Chewie and Lobot for example were just plain cool. Oh well, I still bought his action figure anyways ... and it came with this stupid staff thing that he never uses in the movie. Anwyways, off of my rant and back to the movie. Flaw #1: Medichloreans - What the hell? Am I honestly supposed to believe that the force is controlled by biology? Jeez, George! Way to kill the mystery of something that was once cool because it was mysterious. Medichloreans are the worst example of the prequels over-explaining everything. Flaw #327: (What, you thought I was actually going to keep count?) bad plot. The plot of this movie is really lackluster, especially compared to the originals, and it really doesn't have much to do with the other Star Wars movies, so it's kind of a waste of screen time except that it introduces us to the really young versions of some of the sagas main heroes and sets up some really boring political subplot. Once again, I understand why George included it, to basically show the Emperor's rise to power through playing both sides against each other, but it doesn't change the fact that it's boring. Anyways, on to the movies strengths which pretty much balance out the weaknesses in my opinion. First off, I love the look of this film. The bright soaring clean quality definitely depicts the galaxy in the height of its economical prowess, before the ""dark times"" of the original trilogy. It really captured the big screen essence of the original trilogy in a lot of ways in my opinion. George did what he did best and went BIG with this one. Everything is so over the top and full of eye candy that it works in the same way that the originals did, at least visual-wise. George Lucas is a brilliant man when it comes to visuals, but the story is where he really falls short here. Fortunately, he makes up for his failures in storytelling with incredible visuals and stunning fight scenes with a climactic fight scene that really blew my mind and not to mention that amazing podrace. Great moments like that really require a theater for proper viewing. So, all in all, George did what he set out to do with this one, he introduced the characters, got them all together and depicted the beginning stages of Palpatine's rise to power with a plot that definitely gives you lots to look at (including a completely pointless, yet somewhat enjoyable underwater chase sequence with giant fish), but it fails to do much else and the story isn't layered enough to offer much more than eye candy upon repeated viewings. Oh well, despite its flaws it'll still be the first movie I watch the next time I have a Star-Wars-a-thon.",0

3347,6.0,"This was the worst good movie I've ever seen. On one hand the story was fantastic, the political maneuvering of Palpatine was inspired, and the action sequences were amazing. The characters were well done, and you could see the beginnings of a much larger story begin to unfold, just as it was supposed too. Unfortunately it fell short of expectations. George Lucas's lackluster directing skills, looking at the movie through rose colored glasses instead of letting somebody else direct it to make sure they got the most out of their actors and pacing hurt its believability. A lot more emotion and more realistic portrayal of said emotions would have gone a long way in making it be a better film. Anakin's innocence needed to be shown, to not only show how far he falls, but to establish the good person Luke sees in him later; but Jake Lloyd, whether because lack of talent of or bad Direction came off more annoying and corny than a likable warm young boy. The Pod Race scene showed his ability to pilot something very hard to fly, even from a young age. That's fine and good but unfortunately again it's diluted with silly looking aliens that were too cartoonish to really work in the context of a photo-realistic CGI universe, and the two-headed announcer completely soiled the whole mood of the ""Epic Space Opera"". It's seemed so out of place it was jarring in the extreme. Lastly there is Jar-Jar Binks and Boss Nass. Meant to appeal to small children and show how much more innocent and carefree the time period was; these characters did a wonderful job. Still, constant slapstick, fart and poop jokes and Boss Nass spitting all over the place by shaking his head with his mouth open and going ""BRBRRBRRRBRBRRB!"" really seemed to take you out of the drama and in a lot of cases seemed really stupid and moronic. They didn't feel like they gelled with the rest of the Star Wars Universe that I had grown up with, too immature. To go back to the good though, Darth Maul was a fantastic opponent for the Jedi. He had a strong presence about him, and Ray Park's stunt work with the lightsaber battles had my jaw on the ground. I was upset to see that cool of a character die, but even so I found him to be one of the highlights. Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by the nephew of Denis Lawson (who played Wedge Antilles in Episodes IV, V, and VI); Ewan McGregor also was very convincing as an extremely skilled sword fighter. His portrayal of the character was a wonderful homage to the original actor Sir Alec Guinness. Qui-Gon Jinn, played by veteran actor Liam Neeson embodied everything I thought a Jedi should be. He was very much like the Samurai the Jedi were modeled after. Quiet, thoughtful and wise, but able to spring to deadly action as soon as it was needed, whereas most of the Jedi Council were more like monks and seemed too stale in their attitudes (Though this is on purpose, and is an integral part of the overall story). The scene where he is facing off against Darth Maul separated by the force field was one of the best examples of the Jedi vs. Sith attitudes put to screen. The two combatants are separated and can't fight for the moment. Qui-Gon sits down and meditates, finding his center, communing with the Force. Maul paces back and forth like a caged animal, anticipating the conflict, and tapping the field with his saber in impatience and hubris. A very meaningful moment illustrating the two different philosophies that I think is greatly overlooked. All in all I think the Phantom Menace was a good movie, which fell short of its true potential. 3 out of 5 stars. (or 6 out of 10 here)",0

3362,9.0,"As a self-proclaimed Star Wars fan, I have anxiously awaited this day for what seemed like forever.  I had heard reviews claiming that the film plays young, is corny, has great effects, but stale acting.  I approached it with an open mind-- I wanted the experience of a NEW Star Wars to take me away; I was going to enjoy myself.  Lucas has said that it's just a movie. . . people have made more of it over the years than he intended.  That may be, but there's no denying that the original Trilogy has meant an awful lot to an awful lot of people.     We revel in the opportunity to see Lucas' imagination at work in our favorite galaxy, and we understand that it is his galaxy to create.  Nevertheless, we can't help ourselves from wanting the new to be as good as the familiar.  The Star Wars name carries a heavy burden of responsibility.  It is a world free of any other, a story able to exist independently of any particular time and place, transcendent.  So we wince a little when Chewie does the Tarzan yell in Return of the Jedi. And in Episode I, we hope that such references are rare.  There are some things we want to stay fantastic, not grounded in experience.  The magic of the Force is its mystery, a beautiful, intuitive energy beyond the rational and ephemeral.  so, there are many little things about The Phantom Menace that disappoint.  But Lucas does not.     The film, I am glad to report, excites. It is as though we all remember the true Star Wars as the story progresses. The light saber duels, the space fights, the personal over the oppressive machine: all prevail.  I was giddy as the blue letters first came on screen, and as the music played.  I loved the early minutes, then fell into a passive state of observation.  But when the pod race comes, and when Darth Maul attacks, and when the climactic sequences hit, I was thrilled.  This is the Star Wars I know; Lucas has kept up his end of a bargain he never agreed to-- it was set upon him.  And so go to the movie, and enjoy.  Have fun. Be swept away, because It's back.",1

Obi-Wan is just so cute! It had a sad outcome though because of Qui-Gon dying. I kinda was hoping that he was going to live on for a while longer. It was just really sad. The only kinda creepy thing was that Yoda was a puppet so he can't bounce of walls like in Episode II and III. I think that it would have made it just that much better if Yoda wasn't a puppet.",1

I hope Episodes II & III take recent criticism to heart and return the series to glory.",1
3365,4.0,"Don't get me wrong.. The special effects are wonderful and several scenes are awesome, but on further reflection after seeing the movie, I get the feeling that George Lucas wrote this movie for children. I'm sure he wishes he could have gotten a G rating for it. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue is vapid at times. There is no depth to the characters where there should be (read Darth Maul, Qui Gon, etc) and enourmously too much time spent on characters that have nothing to do with the film (read Jar Jar Binks). It was a disappointment to the extent that I felt let down. This movie could have been cutting edge Science Fiction and a great lead off for the next 2 movies to come. Instead it's a simple kids movie that is a let down for all the people that grew up with Star Wars are a part of their dreams. George Lucas, please make the next ones better.",0

I feel sorry for those who choose not to like this latest in the series.  The familiar universe, the fantasy/fable story line, the breathtaking action and visuals, and the portents of things to come all heavily outweigh the quirks.

The special effects were incredible as expected, and I thought the lightsaber duels were far superior to the originals. Overall a pretty good movie, I like the way Lucas alludes to Anakin's future demise into the dark side and all of the other subtle references to the next episodes.

There were several good things in this movie, despite the following: Anakin should have been a teen actor; what the Queen lacked in spirit she made up for in over the top costumes and makeup; Jar Jar needed subtitles-I don't know about anyone else, but I gave up trying to figure out what he was saying about 3 minutes into his first scene.

3382,8.0,"Wow.  It was visually thrilling, and I liked the story, but it was way too predictable.  It needed some more twists, and it really needed a giant space battle.  Besides that, it was quite enjoyable, and I recommend it to everyone out there.  It was definitely way better than Titanic, which IMHO was kind of lacking in the interest department.",1
3383,8.0,"For the first episode in the series it does a decent job being exciting AND setting things in motion. I must admit there was a little too much comic relief(Jar Jar Binx) throughout the movie, possibly done to make some of the slower parts more interesting. Also I expected Darth Maul to be in it much more than he was after all he IS the deliciously evil antagonist. Despite that I give it a solid two thumbs up, after all I HAVE seen it twice already and it only came out 2 days ago.",1
3384,10.0,Fantastic Special Effects.  Wish my computer could be as detailed.  The only thing I really did not like about this film was the grammar and syntax used by Jaa Jaa Binks.,1
3385,5.0,"This movie was great.  The fight scenes were amazing, along with the special effects, but there was plenty of stuff the movie could have done without. First, the annoying Jar Jar character, and his whole race.  All they are is the digital, modern day equivalent of the Ewoks.  For a Star Wars movie, there was too much (attempted)slap stick humor, and it sort of ruined the tone of the movie.  Well, somebody has to say something bad about this movie.",1
3386,5.0,"I can't say I was disappointed with this movie, but it definitely could have been better. The Special Effects were INCREDIBLE, better than anything I have ever seen. Some of the dialouge is suspect, and some of the comic relief is very juvenile but it's far from being a bad movie. Some of the stand out scenes, to me, were the Podrace, and The Lightsaber Dual between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul was.....well incredible, once again. Bad things about the movie: not enough Obi-wan, C-3po, or Darth Maul. And WAY, WAY, WAY too much of the very annoying Jar Jar Binks. Sure it is very cool that a totally digital character can blend in so seamlessly, BUT his voice and the way he talks, grammar wise, is annoying from the very first word that come from his mouth. I just hope Episodes 2 and 3 are better. And possibly, if I go see the movie again, it will begin to grow on me.",0

All it is is an introduction and set-up for what's to come.  Don't expect anything more.  This is an awesome movie, and the more I watch it, the more I can't wait for Episodes 2 and 3...  It's definitely worth watching.  The true Star Wars fan will enjoy it.",1

3393,5.0,"No movie could truly live up to the hype that has been put around this movie, and certainly Phantom falls far short. A lot of basic cinematic flaws, it shows that Lucas has not directed for such a long time. I wish his vision would have allowed someone with more experience to direct. Certainly the script could have been worked much better to remove the numerous plot holes. In all I found the movie to be hokey; the Pod races, the immaculate conception of Ani, etc.. Only true saving grace was the extremely well choreographed and exciting saber duel, but I felt that I was watching Jedi all over again at the end. It is a shame also, to have so many talented actors and almost all of their time on screen is a waste. I truly hope Mr.Lucas will be able to produce the next 2 despite of this movie and that they will be much better. I feel this movie ripped away the magic and wonder that the first series gave to us.",0
3394,6.0,"I saw SW-TPM just after midnight on premiere day.  It was definitely an interesting experience before the movie began, as the crowd was very pumped up and ready to go. As far as the film itself goes, I have somewhat mixed feelings about it. It strikes me as a normal ( and good ) thing that George Lucas obviously wanted to make a film that his, and other children would enjoy.  The only problem I have with his execution, is that I believe he went too far down the road with that mindset, to the detriment of the enjoyment of his adult audience. A large part of the reason that he has the financial capability to make this film in the first place, is because of the huge support of the previous trilogy by fans like myself, and I am a little disappointed that he didn't see fit to throw a bone or two to viewers that have, in fact, grown up somewhat since the original three films.  Having said that, I believe that filmmakers should follow their own vision, and Mr. Lucas's vision will certainly bring a new generation of fans into the fold. The film itself is a wonder to behold, visually.  It's hard to think of a sequence where computer graphics haven't been extensively used, and the results are really nothing less than dazzling.  The pace of the editing was a little on the jarring side, and gives the film a rushed feeling.  You never really get a chance to become comfortable with the scenes, or the characters themselves.  Generally, the acting is reasonably well done, considering the focus of the film isn't on deep characterization.  Liam Neeson does solid work here, and while Ewan MacGregor isn't given much to do onscreen, I particularly enjoyed how he was able to put some of Alec Guiness's cadence into his lines.  Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman do a decent enough job with their respective roles as well.  The actor whose work impressed me the most, was definitely Ray Park's portrayal of Darth Maul. Just the physical presence of this character was a treat to watch, and the film should have made more extensive use of him. All in all, SW-TPM was entertaining enough, and I would suggest that any adults wanting to see it should take your children, as I believe this will give you the best possible perspective to enjoy the film yourself.",1

How can so many people tell me that TPN's plot is thin and that A New Hope's is great?? Come on people, some courageous boy (a knight) and his buddy try to save a princess!! A princess, of all people! Could have been someone's sister or cousin, but it was a princess!! Is that Super Mario Bros enough for you?? Sure, TPM's plot wasn't great if you consider it alone, but that's the thing though, it's engulfed in all the movies. Episode 4's script was reinforced by Episode 5's and 6's.  Now, Episode 1's will be by 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.",1
3398,10.0,"I thought the movie was excellent and very well done. It seems like too many fans and critics are nitpicking this movie instead of just sitting back and enjoying it. The first trilogy was trashed for having bad dialogue, weak characterizations, and slim plot. When did that all change? This movie is just continuing on the proud tradition. I enjoyed the story and the characters just as I enjoyed them in the original trilogy.",1
3399,7.0,"This highly anticipated first chapter of the Star Wars Saga couldn't live up to the media hype that built up before its release but, overall, it is a good film.  The small, relatively minor conflict depicted here actually only sets the political stage for all the films to follow but it is still compelling enough to make this picture interesting.  Also Lucas does take a more leisurely approach at the beginning of this film than in any of the other Star Wars films but the second half of the film takes off and is as exciting as the finales of the three previous movies.   The highlights of this film are the visuals which really brings these exotic worlds to life; the pod race which was obvious inspired by the chariot race of ""Ben Hur""; the end lightsaber battle which makes the previous saber battles look lethargic in comparison; and the incredible sound effects which are what I like best about all the Star Wars films.   The low point is Lucas' pandering again to children (like he did with the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi"") by adding a silly, annoying character, Jar Jar Binks, to the mix - he comes across as a bad mixture of both Roger Rabbit and the ""Lost in Space"" monkey. Chalk this character up to the fact that Lucas makes three times as much money on merchandise than he does on ticket sales.   But, with the exception of Jar Jar, this really is a good film.  Also, if you do go to see it, be sure to drive the extra miles to see it in digital sound - it makes a very big difference in the enjoyment of this film.",1
3400,10.0,I think Phantom menace was the most underrated of all star wars films. Why? Because very few people understood that it's jolly characteristic was very well put. George Lucas was trying to recreate the way the Republic was before transforming into the empire.Also you can start to see how the dark side of the force is showing it's face once more after a long period of preparation. The saga is not only a saga of a family (Anakin and Luke and Leia Skywalker) or of the force (the Sith begin to show themselves in the this installment) as it is of the decay of a great institution (republic). In conclusion George Lucas was Brilliant in it's making and we should commend him for his genius and vision.,1
3401,9.0,"To start out, this movie is great. It has great action, great effects, great music, and (mostly) great characters. The special effects truly are the reason I enjoy this movie so much. The very best scenes are on the republic capital of Coruscant. It is wonderfully done, and very realistic. The action scenes are wonderful, and remind me of the impossibly fast fighting in The Matrix. Natalie Portman is wonderful as the queen, and Neeson is a fine Obi-Wan. The computerized Jar Jar Binks was not as big an annoyance as I had been fearing, and actually was quite amusing in many parts. Jake Lloyd was actually my least favorite actor here. He just does not seem to get many scenes right. I can't wait for him to start blowing up planets and wiping out the Jedi. The movie is good, but it is a kids film. Don't expect the depth and plot of the originals, there is too much glitz for that to happen here. Hopefully the depth of the series will show itself",1
3402,,"This is a good film.  The more I think about it, the more I like it - primarily because I'm looking at it more and more in the context of how it will fit in with Eps IV to VI.",1
3403,8.0,"The critics have been quick to pan this film and the media has tried to spoil it with all the extra hype. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story and the acting was nowhere near as bad as critics would have us believe, in fact some is excellent, Liam Neeson is superb as Qui Gonn Jinn, Ewan MacGregor is not far behind and really worked hard on his voice and mannerisms to be a convincing Obi-Wan and is plausible as a young Alec Guinness. The film is of course ultimately the greatest special effects showcase ever to be seen on screen, you will be astonished be the amount of CGI and constantly be thinking ""how did they do that?"" George Lucas could not have done better. Go see it (before someone who already has ruins it for you!)",1
3404,7.0,"Although admittedly I am not a mega Star Wars fan, I still enjoyed the previous 3 movies immensely.

3405,6.0,"This is a good movie, no doubt about that. Visually stunning, and while the story is loaded with exposition, there is plenty of good action. Lightsabre action, pod racing, underwater civilization. There's some characters I like better than others, some who won't be in the next movie even though I'd've liked them to be and others that I just didn't like. All in all this is a good watch, and I will see it again soon (Preferably before midnight, the next time). And I think there's a tip of the hat to Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy) in there",1

Lucas is an excellent story teller and I can't wait to hear the rest. The sounds of children laughing and adults gasping make movies. The art of story telling is to draw emotion from the audience not put them to sleep like most of the movies that win academy awards. Sorry English Patient and Titanic. Smile, unwind and enjoy.",1
3419,10.0,"I, sadly, expected Mr Lucas to sell out diehard fans such as myself. I was surprised to discover that he didn't. There were several inside jokes, hints, allusions. I was also very pleased with the imagination of the film. Senator Palpatine could have merely risen to power instead of the intricate way in which he is doing it.  Also he has left several things that we need to question and speculate.  Great job Mr. Lucas, Keep up the good work!",1
3420,,"First of all when you go to see this film you've got to go with an open mind, don't expect it to be the worst or best film you've ever seen. Take no notice of the critics. That's the way I went into the cinema, with a pure open mind. Even if a stupid title on the soundtrack had already ruined the ending for me. Right, for starters when you watch tpm your going to see the greatest display of visual effects you've ever seen. The world that has been created for this film is absolutely amazing. There's so much detail throughout the entire film it truly is mind blowing. And then there's the story, thinking back to all the negative reviews I've seen saying 'where's the story' these people were obviously knitting a jumper or something while the film was on, cos the story is actually quite good. Its just the usual space rubbish, there's a trade ban on the planet naboo (something to do with taxes) and the senate want the queen to sign a treaty so they can take control of the planet, but its all a front for the baddies to get control...etc. I wont go on about it too much, because the story does get a wee bit confusing at times, but in reference to the characters the story has set itself up very nicely for the next episode. But these people who complain about the story, what did you expect, its star wars. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, I must admit I was very surprised at how tolerable he was. I managed to catch onto his speech straight away, I can imagine he must be irritating if you can't get what he's saying. But he did provide some very funny moments, especially the bit before the pod race. Ahh the pod race, let me tell you its worth going to see this film on the big screen just to see the pod race. Its funny (provided by the two headed commentator who is voiced by the excellent greg proops),its fast, very fast, its exciting and visually its outstanding. That acting in it is good na'll. Liam neeson was excellent (but then again he usually is) ewan mcgregor was good enough even if he was trying to be too english and natalie portman was excellent as the queen. The only complaint I have about the film was Jake Lloyd, he was just too annoying, he just never stopped talking but thankfully he wasn't in it enough to ruin the film. And he also provided a quite unbelievable climax to one of the sequences at the end of the film. But then again this is star wars, oh and the duel at the end between that mean mutha darth maul and the jedis is another outstanding action sequence. So go and see it. Just remember its star wars, its not going to be the best film you've ever seen, quite a bit of it is aimed at kids, just let it take you along for the ride and you will be entertained !!",1

However, my parents took me to see both EMPIRE and JEDI, each knowing the power and wonder that the Star Wars saga gives to each and every person in the audience regardless of their age, race or creed.  I have grown up with Star Wars and feel a connection to its many themes and messages of bravery, selflessness and redemption.  Now, with the dawn of the first of three prequels, the wonder and beauty of Star Wars has returned to fill our hearts with those same high ideals.  I loved the Phantom Menace, not only for its stunning visuals, but its solid and well sculpted plot and lessons of taking action in the face of adversity even against seemingly unsurmountable odds. Each character was well developed (yes, even Jar Jar) and the roles were executed by the actors with precision and care.  Lucas has once again taken us to a magical universe where the old American Spirit still reigns with dignity and wonder.",1
3424,9.0,"I was lucky enough to get to the first regular North American showing of Episode 1.  Newfoundland being 1 and 1/2 hours ahead of EST and a 12:01 a.m. showtime helped :-) I have to say first off, it was a wonderful show.  The visual effects grabbed you and held you and the sound was incredible though I found the story a bit wanting.  I didn't find myself particularly drawn to or connecting with any of the characters and I think I would have wandered a bit if it wasn't for the sound and images.  But!! Hold me they did! I think the original trilogy had the same problem... simple stories (and a bit preachy) but the effect on your senses made them wonderful movies.  So this one will join the original trilogy among my favourites. It won't win any Oscars for anything other than technical achievement but everyone will see it 3 or 4 times or more :-)",1

I have to say that I had very high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed in any measure. Lucas has come so far from A New Hope, and yet everything about this film was right on the money. I can only imagine what it would have been like to see the original trilogy produced with the stunning array of technology displayed herein. It was such smooth digital effects work that I rarely noticed it was digital. There are points to nitpick, but if the original serves as any example, no Lucas creation will be ever be free from the critiques of its most diehard fans. All will enjoy The Phantom Menace!",0

The story, well a bit naive in some respects and some aspects not very well explained or a bit rough, lots of parallels to the original trilogy (final saber duel, battle against ""death star"" type ship). The special effects - awesome, especially the computer simulations of the aliens were a lot better than I had anticipated. The light saber fights - make all others pale in comparison. This is what jedis should move like - they are really kick-a** smooth fighting machines. and yet I didn't think the movie had it. It lacks soul, it lacks the breathtaking sort of exhilaration of the others, you don't sit there spellbound and route for Han Solo or anybody. you just sit there and go - hey, that's cool, ooh, that's nice..., but it never grips you (except for the sword fights maybe, but then they really have it - it's not some gasping little boy Skywalker hacking away at a bad boy Vader, these are sleek and lethal bad a** jedis. Possibly the pod race as well). I'm not sure whether it's bad acting and a weak story/dialogue that destroys the Star Wars magic here, but the movie is sorely lacking here.

Looking back at the full body of work that is the prequels, and comparing them to the original three and any other movie released for that matter, I now consider this the best of the three prequels. That's like somebody receiving an award for the tallest midget, however. Though this film had a horribly conceived plot, at least it had a horribly conceived plot. The two movies that followed (Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith) were both completely incoherent messes. These three movies compare in no way with the original three, and in fact don't hold up well with your run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster. When viewing all six films with an adult frame of mind (I was alive when the original three made their theatrical debuts) it is clear that the Empire Strikes Back is easily the best film. The original and Return of the Jedi are next, a far chasm away from Empire. Then there is another huge chasm with this movie being the ""best"" of the prequels. That's why I give this film two stars. The extra star is for the horribly conceived plot. The last two films, in my opinion, are so bad that they don't even qualify as films, because they lack an important ingredient that makes a film a film. That ingredient is a plot.",0

Good plot (oh I read somebody's report saying that the Federation wasn't scary...they aren't suppose to be...they are cowards...it's Darth Maul who is scary...geez), Good sound, EXCELLENT ACTING (hey see how good you stuck up critics act when you're in a room with a big blue screen and your suppose to be talking to a crazy alien with big ears), And George did a good job making it feel like it was in the same galaxy far far away. Anyway, in order to like and understand Star Wars you have to treat it like a totally different movie. It's like nothing ever before. You can't compare it to Star Trek or Lost in Space. And that is what critics do. They take a good movie and if the other movies don't match up to that movie, the other movie stinks. You can't treat Star Wars like that. Well i don't care what anybody says, ""Star Wars"" is a very very well done movie. Thanx.",0

3448,10.0,"Hype is a dangerous thing. Hype is a tool of marketing. Hype leads to high expectations, high expectations lead to disappointment, disappointment... leads anger. Anger at the movie for it not being 'good enough.' Anger at them for tricking you. But before the anger consumes you, ask yourself how good were the originals? Why did they become cult films? It was because there was something fundamental at their core, something that few other films had. That same something is present in today's Episode 1. It's sitting there so quietly, and you may not recognize it because of all the junk that the studios have spat out for the last 16 years. I recommend re-watching the originals before you go see it. Let the hype be damned. Don't forget why you loved the first ones, and don't go looking for something different in this film. After you see it give it some time to turn itself over in your mind before you either praise it or condemm it. I, for one, was sad when i left the theater... why you might ask?

3450,7.0,"I would say that ""The Phantom Menace"" is a Good film but no more. It was obvious that it would not be the best of the Star Wars films. A Character named Jar Jar ruins the movie. As unbelievable as it may seem, He is MORE annoying that C-3PO was in the Originals. If He is in Episode II, than it would be good to see him die! Another thing that ruins the movie is the unfunny jokes and the repetition of the Words ""Youpi""and ""Ani""(for Anakin) one too many times. Without that, the movie would have been as good as Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back or The Return of the Jedi. It is evident that with a main character as a hero the movie becomes quite immature at times although it is well balanced out by the Lightsaber fights and it should be less evident in Episode II and III as Anakin gets older.",0

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect because of some small flaws but, it certainly is not as bad as several overly critical critics would have you think.  I mean does anyone remember how several critics originally hated ""A New Hope"" but, in recent years had to go back on their original comments and say that it really was a good film?  And besides, it's just entertainment.  It is also a piece of art but, we're not discussing nuclear winter or the bleak future of mankind and the earth here so lighten up and enjoy the film.  Take your kids, be a kid, have some popcorn, clap, cheer, yell, remember how it was to see ""A New Hope"" back in 1977 when you were a child (or Younger adult), and don't compare ""The Phantom Menace"" to ""ANH"" because that was 1977 and this is 1999.  :)",1

The pre-release reviews I read were all a bit harsh - although I will say that Anakin has some dreadful dialogue.  But as a whole, as a piece, it works, it was fun, I had a great time.

I enjoyed the film very much, but knew that it wouldn't live up to the hype (Would it be as good as the first one?); that would be impossible. Anyway, after the first 10 to 20 minutes I was very worried.  The pace was too fast and there was no plot development, too many of Lucas' famous wipes, fades, dissolves, etc.  However, once our Jedi buddies Qui and Obi Wan met Anakin, things slowed down and the movie got on the right track.  It wasn't as action packed as Star Wars or Jedi, but it kept my interest enough to keep me from leaving my seat.  I'll probably go see it a few more time to take it in more and see if i missed anything.   Overall, a great film.  I can't wait to see the next one.  How long before lines start for that one?  When somebody starts the official countdown, let me know.",1
3464,8.0,"With all due respect to Mr. Lucas, I think it was frankly impossible for him to live up to every expectation of fans who have long awaited this moment. In that regard I think many people set themselves up for disappointment when they were hoping to get the same feeling they had for previous Star Wars films.  I think that may be the problem many have had in keeping themselves from enjoying Episode I and in others it is what has allowed them to forgive all this films short comings.  Frankly, I think the original Star Wars was a very corny movie, I still loved it and had a great time watching it but it was some what lacking in plot itself.  I think if one looks at Episode I as the equivalent to Star Wars Episode IV in the respects that this is only the first part of a much greater story and Lucas is only trying to set us up for what is to come, it is all much easier to take in.  It doesn't help that we are not so closely attached to all the new characters we are meeting but for that matter I wasn't so closely attached to Luke, Leia, Han and rest, after my first time watching Star Wars.  I think all the hype behind it is another main factor keeping many people from enjoying it. It most certainly wasn't the greatest movie of all time but it was still pretty good.  Let go of expectations and just enjoy it.  I know I had a great time watching it.  It of course had elements that I found annoying but for that matter so did the other three and I've yet to not have a good time watching Star Wars.",1

I knew that it would be tremendous pressure for a director to come out of a 15 year hiatus and produce a movie that could match the pure joy we received from watching the blessed trilogy. Epsiode One was a gift from Lucas, an explanation of some things and an opening of door for more possibilities. He led us back to a time when things were becoming chaotic in the Republic and he gave us new characters to fear and love. All in all the movie left me with a great excitement and feeling that this is just the beginning.",1
3469,8.0,"Being a child of the first Star Wars generation, I had extremely high hopes for the new series. Despite all the negative feedback and horrible reviews this film is getting, I tremendously enjoyed it, as did most people that I know. The first time I was more or less entertained by it, but not blown away by any means. The second time around, it was just FUN. Jar Jar gets less annoying, the aliens get a little more endearing and seem less digitized and Ewan just gets better and better every second he's onscreen. Many say that Liam Neeson is the tentpole holding this film up. I contend that it's instead Ewan Mcgregor as young Obi Wan Kenobi. He conveys a perfect balance of unrestrained youthful energy, eagerness, physical ability (watch that last lightsaber scene), and emotional maturity. He'sdefinitely on track to become the Obi Wan we all know from A New Hope. He feels exactly, right down to the great accent, like you'd imagine Obi Wan would have while he was still in training. The thing that really irritated me most in the film wasn't Jar Jar, but the character of Anakin Skywalker. Every word that comes out of that boy's mouth is just painful and awkward. It's a good thing he's not slated for either of the two following episodes. The scenery is beautiful, although a lot of it does feel too computerized. Somehow, despite all the flaws (of which there were many in the originals as well) this movie is just plain entertaining. I don't think anything is quite as hilarious as seeing Warwick Davis of Willow pop up in the audience next to Jabba the Hutt in the pod racer scenes. Watch for this, it's hysterical. The allusions to the coming episodes are plentiful and subtle enough to merit seeing this film several times. I think it's a wonderful setup of things to come and what a lot of people seem to be forgetting is that of COURSE the plot and characters aren't going to be that well developed yet because everything here is merely a setup to a story that will take five more episodes to play itself out. Lucas can't give us too much here...or there will be nothing left for 2 and 3. No love story? Yeah, that's because Anakin is NINE. We get that next time. And watch chancellor Palpatine..it's going to be interesting to see how the double role of good and evil he plays in this first episode unfolds over the next two. This is really a great setup for the next two. Sure, we could have done with a better Anakin and NO Jar Jar, perhaps fewer effects, but all the right elements are there and if you go see this again, I am sure you'll find it much more entertaining and rewarding now that we've gotten past all that awful hype. Just give it another shot. This is for the NEW Star Wars generation....it isn't trying to cater to the old one.",1

Darth Maul is the perfect devil-incarnate villain providing the same mysterious presence & intrigue as Boba Fett (with about the same amount of screen time); & despite popular opinion, I found Jar Jar adorable & entertaining.  I would go so far as to say it is visually perfect.  The sets, costumes, stunts & effects are mind-blowing and the characters are as charming as they are beautiful; the pod-race & lightsaber battles are not to be missed!  I also can't wait to see characters such as Darth Sidious & Mace Windu emerge more in episodes II & III.

Having seen The Phantom Menace I can say I wasn't disappointed, there are some areas of the film which are weak, Jar Jar Binks is irritating but thankfully not enough to ruin the whole movie, Let's hope his role is reduced in the next 2 prequels. Darth Maul was a strong character who stole the scenes he appeared in, and the two Jedis were cool, though I hope that Obi-Wan's role will be worked on later, to be honest this wasn't really his film, I feel great things are to come from him. At the end of the day the dialogue wasn't great, but it never was in the original trilogy, the special effects were outstanding, especially the pod race, final battle scene and the lightsaber duels, and all the gadgets, weapons, ships etc.. used in the movie are still cooler then any other sci-fi movie, this is a Star Wars film, and if you don't like Star Wars then don't expect to like this (no surprise there then), I am a Star Wars fan and I loved it, I look forward to the next two, which I think will take this franchise to another level.",1

All the elements of the trilogy were to be found in this movie:  Jedi lightsaber battles, spaceship combat, the droids, the Force, it was all there.

3485,6.0,"I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I was looking forward to seeing this and, in common with many people, I found it a real disappointment. Anything that starts off with tax problems over trade routes really puts the audience on the back foot right away - something more epic would have gone down much better. Then we have the problems - Anakin Skywalker is just too young to be the centre of the film and so it lacks a heart (his mum also calls him Annie all the time - The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow, tomorrow). That two Jedi knights (who promote terror with the Trade Federation) should have to rely on him so much is just unbelievable. Lucas goes and spoils the whole concept of the Force by explaining it for us. Queen Amidala is apparently a 14-year-old elected Queen - I don't know about you but I wouldn't vote for a teenaged girl to run my country, let alone my planet. Lucas kills Darth Maul for God's sake, he's the best thing in the film. There's no big Death Star destruction-style finale. Boss Nass appears to be a completely different species to the rest of the Gungan race. Lucas goes for the bigger fish eating big fish line not once but twice, we got the message the first time George! Obi Wan is woefully under-used. Natalie Portman is horribly one note as Amidala and her scene with R2 is just cringeworthy (as is the scene where the pre-pubescent Anakin hits on her, it's child molestation I tell you). How come the battle droids don't have a shield when the primitive Gungans do? There's no big baddy like Darth Vader - Darth Maul's good, but he's no Vader. The pod race is ripped off from Ben Hur and, even then, there's no sense of danger because Lucas plays it for laughs (a two-headed race commentator, I ask you). The space battle at the end is somewhat boring and Annakin manages to destroy the ship with absolute ease. I could go on, but I'd have to mention Jar Jar and the script if I did. On the good side, the special effects are terrific (although the droids and the Gungans just don't look real, I'm still not convinced SFX are at the level Lucas thinks they are). The light sabre duel is fabulous - really, really good, especially when they have to wait to fight again but Lucas again spoils it by having Obi Wan kill Darth Maul far too easily after all that had gone before. I just hope that Lucas is truly setting things up for the darker episodes two and three but it could just be that he's lost it big time and is far too reliant on special effects.",0

Well low and behold I was wrong. They sat enchanted for all 2 1/2 hours of the phantom menace. I guess to sum up my point here is you can debate the quality, the accuracy, the acting all you want. My belief is that some people were going to believe that this movie was going to be a boom and some thought a bust and really the movie could have been the greatest thing ever and the people who thought it was going to be a bust were going to say that it was sub-par anyway and likewise the movie could have been horrible and the people who thought it was going to be a boom would have made it a cult movie.

3497,9.0,"After attending the midnight showing of ""Star Wars: Episode I"" this past night, I must admit that I do not understand where the critics are drawing their reviews from.  ""Episode I"" is a fantastic movie, which will reward fans and newcomers alike, and excels in the most important aspect of such a film: moviemaking.  Absolutely breathtaking - the first time you see Coruscant at night or the cities of the Gungans, you'll just say, ""Wow."" The climax is one of the most amazing moments in movies I have ever seen, with FOUR different good vs. evil situations taking place at THE SAME TIME. Kind of like the Endor battle scenes, but on crack.",1
3498,7.0,"With all the hype it received, it would have been easy for Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace to fall flat on its face.  Luckily, it did not do so.  The special effects were amazing, the plot was interesting, and the actors all did a great job of filling the roles.  I also enjoyed the way that the foreshadowing was employed, and I left the theaters psyched for episodes 2 and 3 already.  In closing, I left the movie grinning, didn't quit for a while, and look forward to seeing it again.",1
3499,4.0,"Time Magazine had it right when they called this disjointed, uninspiring mess the Phantom Movie. I don't remember an action adventure film of the Lucas caliber falling this flat. If you want special effects that's one thing, but this one really offers more than anyone would ever want, it's almost insulting, that's all there is to this Lucas monstrosity. The jokes weren't even the slightest bit witty and after an hour and a half I couldn't take the spoon fed plot (what plot there was) and the gobbledygook dialogue from that stupid horse headed baffoon of a character any longer--so I did what I almost never do, I walked out. The flat unconvincing dialogue from the rest of the crew was also a  real surprise. I didn't give a lick about what was happening to the Jedis, the little boy or anybody else, and that's too bad b/c what Star Wars was supposed to do-I thought-was get you on the edge of your seat. A real snoozer......",0
3500,9.0,"I think it was a great movie.  Definitely not as good as Episodes IV, V, and VI, but a great movie none-the-less.  The movie had a good story line and awesome special effects.  One thing I did not like in the movie was the part where Queen Amidala, and others, shot some kind of cord thing out of their guns and used them to pull themselves up to the next window.  It reminded me of a Batman movie or something.  Overall, though, I thought the movie was great, although, I think Star Wars fan(atic)s might enjoy it more then non-fan(atic)s because of all the clues towards the characters and things in Episodes IV, V, and VI.  A must see movie.",1

I know a lot of people thought him annoying, but personally i think i've fallen in love =) anyways, bye!",1
3502,5.0,"There are many Sci-Fi movies I have seen in recently.  Knowing that the Phantom Menace was coming up, I was always saying ""This is a good warm-up for the new Star Wars!"" I remember saying that when I saw Starship Troopers, The Fifth Element, and The Matrix.  Now that I have seen The Phantom Menace, I now really have an appreciation for the earlier films. Even though I didn't enjoy The Fifth Element that much when I first saw it, all 3 of those films are far superior to the new Star Wars.  In fact, The Matrix is more like a Star Wars movie than Phantom Menace!  Morpheus was far cooler than Qui Gon Jin or Yoda. Neo was far cooler than Anakin :) Their powers in their computer generated world far surpassed the non-aggressive force power of the Jedi. Agent Smith was far cooler than Darth Maul (and he actually talked!) And lastly, Neo and Agent Smith's battle scene at the end blew Obi-Wan and Mauls fight scene out of the water.  The only saving grace of TPM was the Pod race.  Why didn't lucas just make a spin-off movie about Pod racing that could preface the new trilogy? Then Anakin could already be free and we could get on to business. In short, others have taken the Star Wars theme and updated it for a new generation of children.  Lucas left Star Wars right where it was, in the 80's. I give it a 5 out of 10 because the Pod Racing and Ewan Mcgregor.",1
3503,,"I found this movie driven by the Star Wars marketing machine. Star Wars began as a comic book for adults. Over the years, as the younger set joined the following, the script writers realized that the youth franchise should be the focus. How else can you explain the presence of JarJar Binks? I can hear it now (""we need a hip, funny character the kids can identify with""). Big Mistake.",0

It exceeded my expectations on every level. Neeson and McGregor are powerfully exciting--Luke may have been a Jedi, but if he was trekking around with these two, he would have been carrying their luggage. Their fighting scenes are breathtaking in their speed and grace. Jar Jar isn't great, but he certainly doesn't ruin the whole movie, as some have said.",1

3506,9.0,"George Lucas' latest installment to Star Wars was once again, a masterpiece. To answer the critics quickly: The dialogue is consistent with the rest of the trilogy.  George Lucas has his characters talk poetically at times, but the Star Wars universe isn't real so there is no reason for his dialogue to be.  It is real for the Star Wars universe.  The world is beautiful as we all already know, but the characters, with one exception, are wonderful as well.  There is a humanitarian story of the likes of the first Star Wars movie.  I don't understand what the critics wanted.  Imagine the first Star Wars without seeing Empire or Return of the Jedi.  You wouldn't know Darth Vadar was Luke's father, Yoda even existed, Princess Leia was Luke's sister, or Han Solo and Leia would have romance.",1

3509,7.0,"Having seen Episode I this past Wednesday I was relieved to finally SEE the movie and get past all the fanfare surrounding it. It had been my intention to try and avoid the hype, but being the proud owner of a working cerebrum I was unable to dodge the media saturation. How good would we think this movie was if it hadn't been hyped so ruthlessly? I honestly don't know.  It was clear from my point of view that the movie did not quite measure up to the first three;  if I could remember what it was like to see the movies of the original trilogy for the first time I might like Episode I even less.  It did seem to me that Episode I was a very good science fiction film, and was possessed of some of the ephemeral qualities that made the first three so enjoyable.  Let me try to state my feelings about it this way:  Will you shiver during the opening crawl?  If you are not a Star Wars fan to begin with, probably not.  (I did).  Will you get chills during the lightsaber duel?  Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan, you probably will.  Aside from the really excellent scenes such as the lightsaber duel and the battle on Naboo, however, the movie wasn't outstanding.  It's probably a good thing that Episode I was not the first (or second or third) Star Wars movie released.  The story, in contrast to the excellent computer effects and the fabulous cinematography, as well as those of the first three films, was cluttered and lacking.  It's a shame this movie has to live up to its predecessors but it does.  This one's not going to win many converts--if it had come out instead of A New Hope in 1977, I probably would not have owned any pieces of Star Wars memorabilia. Having said all this, I'll try to make it easy:  if you are a Star Wars fan of any sort, go see it.  If you are a science fiction fan, go see it.  If you're looking to see what all the hoopla is about, forget about it.",1

The elements that many critics look for aren't all there, but I think that there is a shift in critiques for this movie.  Because many today that critique movies are from the generation that created the first Star Wars trilogy. This movie is for those members of the generation spawned by that generation.  This is generation X's star wars trilogy. The visual effects were great, the plot line was very evident and well thought out and I thought this movie is well deserving of the 9 I gave it. I had only one worry about the story line while going into seeing the movie. In ""Episode IV"" young Luke was being told by a wise old Obi Wan that he first met his [Luke's] father and he was already a great pilot.  OK that's fine...but then the teaser trailer comes out and shows Obi Wan meeting Anakin at the young age of 9.   Lucas obviously thought of this and actually made young Anakin a great pilot and eventually the savior of Naboo in a round about sort of way.",1

After some local critics downplayed this totally awesome movie and with some fear after hearing some of the comments of quite abit less than jumping up and down,my family and I saw this wonderful addition to the three only one day after it opened. Wow I'm sure glad I didn't wait almost two years like I did for the first one because I thought it was no big deal. Well let me tell you that I thought George couldn't outdo the special f/x of Empire but I was way wrong,not only did he match them but far surpassed them as well. Young Anakin was played superbly as well as all of the water people. I can't wait for what I hope will be a quad set of videos especially now that the Phantom Menace is out.It is definitely a must see film.",1
3513,7.0,"In the most anticipated film of all time, Star Wars episode 1 The Phantom Menace, grabs you right away with two Jedi in their prime, and shows just a well trained young Jedi can do. It then blasts you to a pod race that is the definition of the word intense. All this is a set up for the four count it 4 layer finale. This film gives a few answers that fans have been guessing at for 15 years and a few old faces as well. But, we have all been watching mindless F\X blockbusters for 20 years, the reason that Star Wars is so huge is because we are ready to hear a great story again. Unfortunately this movie lets great actors go to waste, and has no characters for us to get to know very well. I very much enjoyed this movie, it really kicked ass, but I'm still left with a hunger for a great legend to be added to that outstanding light saber duel. Episode 2 perhaps.",1
3514,6.0,"I was glad to see that the many incredible special effects were concentrated largely on the look of other planets and worlds, and not solely on violence and on buildings blowing up.  George Lucas has an incredible ability to create new and exciting worlds. This time, (as opposed to the earlier Star Wars movies), the sets looked like real places.  I was especially impressed with the underwater world.  I absolutely loved the gelatin-like bubble the characters had to break through to enter the underwater city. It was pure genius. Although I had trouble keeping up with the story-line, as Lucas seems to switch quickly from one situation to another, the real problems with the movie were his characterizations.  The biggest challenge for me as a Star Wars fan is accepting a young and innocent Darth Vader. The sandy haired, blue eyed Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) was a perfect looking choice visually. However, with Lloyd's lack of charisma, and acting ability, along with his character Skywalker's later-to-be-developed evil personality, it made it difficult for me to accept him in any position of hero. Lucas should have been smarter with his choice.  Equally perfectly cast in looks was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala, the future mother of Luke Skywalker. However, her acting was too uneven and choppy, and moves from stiffness to sweetness and finally to heroism. My guess is that given a better choice for opposite lead, she could possibly work out well in future episodes. Especially, (I hate to say it), if she has more carefully guided direction. The characterizations of Obe-Won Kanobee, (Ewan McGregor)and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) could have been a bit more fleshed-out. I would have liked to have known more about them such as, who they are and where did they come from, etc. Also the romance in the movie was wasted on the too young, and was a bit awkward to watch. It would have been more palatable if there were equally a romance between Qui-Gon Jinn and Skywalker's mother, for example. Or perhaps, stage a romance using Obe-Won Kanobee. But please, leave the main romance to the adults Lucas! Well, now that George Lucas has the look of the movie down pat, maybe he can concentrate more on the story and characterizations. Just as a p.s., too bad for the loss of Neeson, put in another cute older main male character for us older female fans in your upcoming episodes. Thanks.",1
3515,,"I went to see the movie on the seat on my pants. I was really excited. But I realized it was way too anticipated.

The argument that critics of this movie are lacking in objectivity seems to make sense, but is actually totally false. I so very much wanted to like this movie...I begged my brain to like this movie. There are simply too many problems, however, that I cannot forgive. The acting is wooden, the script is absurd, the dialogue unintentionally hilarious, and the cast is wasted. Anakin Skywalker as a virgin birth? Criminy. Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in film history. Mr. Lucas, to get a refresher course on how to create an epic masterpiece, see Lord of the Rings...many times.",0
3517,9.0,"I do not consider myself a major Star Wars fan, having seen only parts of the original trilogy.  But I must admit that this movie left me with a sense of awe.  The Star Wars saga really comes alive with this movie.  I loved seeing the Jedi Knights at a time of peace and prosperity.  The character of Obi-Wan Kenobi was portrayed very well, and the fight choreography was spectacular.  Most of the humor was created for a younger audience, and the violence mostly involves robot droids being sliced and diced.  But this movie shows that a film does not have to have gut-splattering violence to be a successful sci-fi action picture.  Incidently, the computer-generated animation was spectacular.",1
3518,10.0,What can I say about this movie but W O W. I have heard mixed reviews of the movie but I am a Star wars fan and this movie gets the ground work for the whole story going. So if you want to know how all this got started see this movie.....,1
3519,4.0,"As critics have said, this movie was huge on SFX, and short on soul and emotion. The SFX were beyond imagination, especially the amazing podrace, all 4 final battles (most notably the Gungan/droid battle), the Gungan underwater city, and the Bongo ride through the core of Naboo. However, there was very little character development, and almost no pure emotion. Jar Jar wasn't as annoying as everyone says, and his comic relief was weak, yet enjoyable, because it held true to the original atmosphere of A New Hope, which is humor and entertainment.  Absolute useless appearances from Jabba the Hut, C-3PO, the Tusken Raiders, the Jawas, and R2-D2(who at least had productive purpose), only used to sell more toys. Portman and McGregor were alright, Lloyd was pretty annoying (glad he won't be in Episode 2), and Neeson was lacking. The humor and wit that Han Solo supplied is totally void in this, almost taking out all of the fun. Darth Maul, who did kick complete ass, only had two lines, and was in about 4 scenes; his Infiltrator, with the ability to cloak, wasn't even used.  On the highest note I can give, this movie leaves a lot of questions in our minds about what happens to the main characters and the others in the next two episodes, even though we KNOW that only 4 people make it to the 4-6 episodes(Yoda, Obi-Wan, Anakin, Palpatine). We know what happens to them in the end, and we know how they get there. The foreshadowing is abundant. However, the exact process has yet to be seen, and a few questions left unanswered. This tells me that the only purpose of ""Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace"" is to act as a sort of prologue to the 5 that follow it. Great things lie ahead for the characters of Anakin, Obi-Wan and Amidala in their development. I can promise that Episode 2 and 3 will be absolute triumphs of cinema history.",1
3520,,"The weeks before the movie, I was disappointed to see that every critic that saw the Phantom Menace was panning it.  I was determined that they were doing so just to be different, and that the success and goodness of this were inevitable.  Well it was not so.  The problem with episode 1 is that it is not its own movie, the only highlights came with references to other moments from the first three movies.  The villain is weak, the kid is taken from Home Alone or something, and in general it was just bad.",0

BUT (and maybe it's because I'm 30 and not 9)when I saw ""Star Wars-A New Hope"" in '77, I felt like I was in the X-Wing fighter and I blew up Death Star. At ""Menace"", when I walked out of the theater, I felt like I just saw another amazing creation by Lucas. I walked out with a BIG smile, but not the goosebumps. Again, I'm 30 and not 9.

The movie I had waited years for was only seconds away.  The audience was hushed as the familiar ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" flashed on the screen. Then came the prologue as John Williams' theme boomed in dolby digital. Tears rushed to my eyes as I realized just how much ""Star Wars "" really means to me.  My breath grew short as the movie began. The visual effects were totally stunning.  As the plot went into full swing, I was totally absorbed by the intricate story line and lifelike characters.  In most cases the acting was superb, especially that of Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, and Jake Lloyd.  When it was all over, I felt I couldn't wait until the 19th when I could see this masterpiece again.  The writing was great, hats off to George Lucas.  If there was one downside to this movie, it was the way Lucas tried to get laughs through cheap humor, but this flaw was not enough to diminish the greatness of the movie at all.  I recommend ""The Phantom Menace"" to anyone. May the Force Be With You All. Drew",1

3531,7.0,"A headline in USA Today read something like ""Phantom' Menaced by Galactic Expectations.""  Based on my experience, this was true. I've seen it twice now and I think the movie focuses too much on special effects and not enough on the story.  There are too many scenes that are simply too contrived in their efforts to showcase the special effects technology.  Also, I think that the character development was incomplete.  I would've loved to see more of Mace Windu and Darth Maul and less of Jar Jar Binks.  Anyway, it's a kid's movie and children will love it.  They'll probably like Jar Jar, too. Being that this was a pre-quel, it was only natural that the ending should be so foreboding, which I think was done very well.  The the framing of the ""senator"" and his young apprentice was very nice.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.",1

The visuals, the abundant eye candy is what would make me watch this film again and again. I do have a few qualms though. The screen time for Darth Maul is seriously low, and that childish Jar Jar Binks character is someone I can really do without. But this I can say. It has the best special effects in any film (the pod racing sequence was jaw-droppingly good), and serves as a good opener for this amazing saga.

But, to the little people like us, who enter the theater to seek entertainment, and not for a job, this movie takes us back to that galaxy far, far away.  It takes us to worlds that are alien yet strangely familiar.  We did not go to the theater to analyze why Jake Lloyd says ""yippee"" all of the time.  We went because there is a little Star Wars in all of us.  It is one thing that people from around the world can relate to. It has become more than we ever expected and I was privileged to see it.

The duels are fantastically intense, and the sheer beauty of the worlds is awe inspiring.

Not that he's not a great looking character and an awesome fighter, but I just wanted more of an actual character. He will never even compare to the popularity of Vader. As for Anakin though... the young boy who played this character made Mark Hamil's Luke Skywalker (from episode 4) look even more like a whiny little brat.

He was so busy trying to amaze us with the special effects that he forgot that the most important part of a movie is still the story line and characters.  The fight scene between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi was amazing but did anyone really care who died?  Now think back when Han Solo was frozen in carbonite or when Luke and Vader were fighting only to find out it was a father and son fighting.  In the New Hope we found ourselves really liking the characters because they were interesting, more developed, and had interesting dialogue.  In the Phantom Menace it seemed Lucas just assumed we would like the characters. Also Darth Vader was way more scaring then Darth Maul, of course that might have to do with the fact I was eight when I first saw Vader but hey who else had his own scary music and choked a person with his mind.  Too cool.",1
3540,9.0,"For those of you who have been waiting in line for a few months now, you'll be both excited and slightly envious when you hear that I saw the movie last Wednesday, and believe-you-me... It's well worth the wait. What Lucas has done with Phantom Menace is create a movie similar to what he did with A New Hope in the sense that the movie is complete in itself and also a brilliant preface to open up the series of Star Wars films.  We are brought back  ""a long time ago in a galaxy far, far, away"" with John Williams brilliant score, and trust me, if you're anything like me, chances are you'll be sitting in the movie theater in disbelief until you finally hear the main Star Wars title theme and watch the nostalgic scroll-screen glide away into space. Now, many of you have probably heard the reviews. A few critics are saying that it won't live up to the pre-hype and inevitably crash within the third week of its release.  But to quote Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, the ""film is virtually critic-proof"", meaning that regardless of what anyone is willing to say about the first chapter in the Star Wars saga, people will be lining up for it anyway.  Many of these reviews target Jar Jar Binks, the fully digitized Gungan character whose lingo is nearly as twisted as the backwardspeak of Jedi Master Yoda. Undoubtedly, Jar Jar's appeal is aimed at the younger generation of budding Star Wars fans, and parents be warned: Your children will want a Jar Jar Doll. Regardless of the specific breakdown of who each character is  meant to sell to, remember that as you sit and watch the film you're witnessing the epic first chapter in the Star Wars saga. What more incentive do you need? Some old favourites are back. Such as Palpatine, in pre-Emperor form; Yoda, in pre-rheumatism form; and Obi-Wan Kenobi, in Ewan McGregor form.  Be ready for the pod-race of your life.  Enjoy!",1

3549,10.0,"I loved the Phantom Menace and can't wait to see it again.  I have seen it 4 times already.  Jar Jar Binks becomes less annoying each time so be patient with him.  Finally the Jedi were presented in their glory.  They made use of ""Force Speed"" when fleeing the Destroyers at the beginning and ""Force Jump"" in the castle's core from catwalk to catwalk.  The Podrace was amazing as was Darth Maul whose music when he was on Tatooine was very cool.  The whispered ""hachacha"" sounds where cool.  He really should have been in the movie more, or not died yet.  He could have been used as an incredibly evil character who killed with no questions.  The queen was perfectly done and Miss Portman did a fantastic job playing a fourteen year old, although I don't recall fourteen year olds being so.. developed if you know what I mean.  The introduction between R2 and 3PO was also great!  Fantastic experience, too bad it's 3 years 'til Episode 2.",1
3550,6.0,"If you saw the remakes of Episodes 4-6 you might be a bit disappointed. Episode 1 looks a LOT like the remakes -- there's a story about a young Darth Skywalker though that is VERY cute -- I think this young actor really steals the show in range and projecting a sense of having genuine fun and awe with the experience  -- I guess that's why adults like kids in general; other non-disappointments include cityscapes and underwater fantasyscapes like you've never seen, really visually magnificent stuff, and there's a race scene that is a specFX breakthrough. I haven't been that absorbed and wowed since having first seen Luke Skywalker fly like a god in a striking back Empire.",0
3551,9.0,"Most critics miss this one. It is a well done adventure. The main players being identified and establishing a presence. The plot holes spoken of are understandable, Lucas knows he will be making two more parts to this trilogy and the gaps will be filled as it moves along. It is a tribute to a vision here that this is an effects driven story. It is a fantasy after all.",1
3552,10.0,"Man oh man, Episode I blew away my expectations.  In my opinion, critics who gave negative reviews of the movie simply jumped on the ""hipper than thou"" bandwagon.  The movie had mega-hit written all over it the moment it was conceived and of course the media, preferring to root for underdogs, was eager to shoot the film down rather than honestly gauging its quality. Why was the film wonderful?  The special effects were seamless.  The fight scenes were choreographed beautifully.  The story was exciting while completing the task of laying the groundwork for the next two films.  The film introduced important characters without becoming character driven, which is what helps Episode I stand on it's own, apart from the original trilogy.  The film transcends the traditional ideas for what a ""good"" or a ""bad"" movie is.  I walked in to the theater almost expecting to be disappointed (thanks to closed-minded critics) and I left the theater mentally placing Episode I in my list of all-time beloved films.  I don't think that older people can appreciate a film like this with the same perspective as people from my generation.  Grownups complain about how Episode I was just a big video game.  My generation was the first to grow up on video games.  We see and appreciate the world in a different way than any generation that has come before.  And this film was made for my generation, just as it's predecessors was made for generations past.  Go see the movie. And when you're done, go see it again and again.",1
3553,9.0,"When i heard about the new Star Wars movie coming out, placing in time before the originals, i was ecstatic.  I had always wondered what had gone on before the first ones, only actually listening to one book-on-tape, it was very intriguing to me.  Where did Yoda come from? Who trained Obi-Wan? Why did Anakin turn bad?  These Questions came to my head whenever I thought about it.  I was one of the first in line to get in, it was a legend to me, and folktale, a story which was introduced to me when I was 3.  I saw it right away, and here is what I have to say. I'll cut straight to the point.  Much like the cheesy, corny little poem I wrote in my last line of the first paragraph, some characters are like this. Jar-Jar Binks for example, is funny for about 10 minutes, but his jokey humor falls through as annoying.  Blowing up battle tanks by accident, killing crucial battle droids, this was unnecessary.  It kind of ruins the whole idea of Star Wars.  Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is supposed to be funny, but not in this way.  How can you top Harrison Ford and Chewbacca's Duet? Impossible.  Not in any way with a dumb computer character that you cant even understand.  How about the Viceroy, and his alien race from the Trade Federation.  These characters quickly struck me as annoying.  They mumbled, and had no personality. The rest however I did enjoy. The battle scenes were much more complicated, and graphic.  The Darth Maul fight was so fast and intense, i held in a large coke the whole time, not daring to move a muscle.  George Lucas i think, with the exception of Jar-Jar, and the Viceroy, did a great job, keeping up his reputation with an exciting fast paced movie.  Till Episode II, May the force be with you.  Go I must now.",0
3554,1.0,Mind the array of audiences and focus on the the picture itself and you'll find Lucas at a phase of losing his touch.  He was great with the prior.  He introduced new innovative technique and style.  This hardly brought anything eye catching.

In Star Wars, it was established early on that Darth Vader was the bad guy. The characters were fighting the Empire but we felt that Vader was in control. Now, this allowed us to care for the protagonists. We knew who they were fighting and who had to be defeated.",0

I have since seen it 2 more times and realize that this is an extremely involved storyline and that it sets the groundwork for the next 2 films. There are many eyebrow raising revelations and hints of things to come. I cannot wait to see what's next. Oh yeah, the special effects are, of course, eye-popping. I was 12 years old when the first film was released. Kudos to George Lucas for re-kindling my Star Wars fire. The critics be damned !! I feel like a kid again !!",0

I was quite disappointed that the Sith were not fully explained, but I am sure that this and many other questions will be answered in Episodes II and III.  I am angry with the critics who feel that this is a bad movie.  It is not meant to stand alone, it is part of the other Star Wars movies, something that many critics are throwing aside.  I do give this movie a high mark, but only because I trust that Lucas will answer many of my questions in the future episodes.",1

3563,9.0,"A breathtaking re-introduction to the saga, sweeping us up in the action and emotion of the present (past?) while planting some sinister seeds of things to come. This film rewards fans who pay attention to detail, with more hidden gags and references than can be absorbed in the first viewing. Episode I presents us with a group of fascinating new characters while providing thoughtful, daring new perspectives of some old ones. I can think of no other film in which such a complex fantasy world is brought to life so vividly and uncompromisingly -- or with such unabashed enthusiasm (and if there is one, I'd love to see it). Together with the other parts of the saga, it creates a story with much more depth and subtlety than most critics give it credit for. While it's true that by itself ""The Phantom Menace"" doesn't spend a particularly long time developing its characters, the time it does spend is made to count. Also, it *is* only an introduction, just like Ep.IV-- and just as Ep.V stunningly provided shading for the characters of ""A New Hope"", I suspect that Lucas has some amazing developments planned for Episodes II & III. MTFBWY. It's not over yet...",1
3564,,"The graphics were fantastic. I found the characters to be boring and uneventful. I think that there was no Han Solo or Luke Skywalker. No romance, or story plot that made you feel for any of the characters. I've seen the other movies a few times but I doubt I would see this again. Nothing to make you want to care.",0
3565,,"Unlike the other three films in the Star Wars saga, this film opened with a complex and wordy explanation of events taking place.  It seemed that Lucas was not only able to include these events in the film but that the beginning of the saga needed an explanation of how it began.  I was not let down by the special effects of the film as Lucas is a master of them but that is not why I went to see it and why the Star Wars saga is such a great story. The acting was good, but the actors did not have much to draw upon.  Most of the characters were shallow and the dialogue was poorly written.  The most annoying character, Jar-jar, an unintelligible bumbling clumsy creature created for the little kids to laugh each time he comes on screen.  An example of the simplistic script is one scene when a big fish eats another fish monster attacking the ship, and Liam Neeson's character says ""There's always a bigger fish,"" then 30 seconds later another fish monster attacks their ship and is again eaten by a bigger fish.  The leaders of the Trade Federation spoke with an overemphasized Oriental accent verging on a caricature.  One of the things that made the original trilogy great was the mythological and religious symbolism, however in Phantom Menace, its single appearance is overdone with the Immaculate Conception of Anakin Skywalker. The Force was always a mystical and mysterious aspect, but in this film one's potential in the Force is verified by a simple blood test, stripping the Force of its wonder and mystery.  There is also a scene in the Senate in which E.T. is alleged one of the Senators.  This film gets so divided that you are simultaneously following five different action scenes, making this picture just another run-of-the-mill ordinary action flick.  The only high points of the film are the special effects, the costumes, and the acting focusing specifically on the Queen, and Darth Maul (who is only in the film at best 15 minutes).  True fans like myself will go see it and probably see it more than once because it is Star Wars, but it is in no sense a good film, and comes nowhere close to the Trilogy.",0

How is it that 20 years before Episode 4, that they are all so elaborate in handling the lightsabres...

The pod race was phenomenal, and the fight between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul is one for the ages.

Natalie Portman did an excellent job playing a queen, and Ewan Mcgregor also did very well playing the young obi-wan-kanobi. the way he carried himself fits seamlessly with the older obi-wan.

The great thing about the original films so not the acting, with this film having better a better standard of acting (exception of Alec Guinness). The Best part of the original movies is wonderful universe that is created, and the human part of the film, with the greatest power in the universe being the force and not any mechanical construction. The Phantom Menace is called by the critics as  just a special effects movie, I don't agree with this. I think the best thing about this film is the interaction between the characters, and seeing glimpse of the way the characters turn out. The only real weakness is , as the critics have said is the other use of computer generated characters, and not as much on the human characters. But overall it met my expectations and can't wait for  episode 2",1
3582,9.0,"Delivering on the promise made 15 years ago, Lucas has delivered a treat. Clearly catering more to the Star Wars fan than to the non-fan, the movie is filled with numerous inside jokes and references to the previous films, and divulges some plot details which, as they are developed in the coming two movies, should shed some interesting light on what we knew as the first trilogy, but shall soon see as the second.",1

The battles of the Jedi and Sith were the most amazingly well done of all the StarWars films.  The only lacking parts were the starship battles, though that's not what this is about.  There were so many tiny things that eluded to the movies of the past, one such being the final line of Senator Palpatine ...

Being surrounded by the atmosphere of opening night only added to the newest Star Wars experience. I watched the movie without expectations but with much anticipation in hopes that it would convey a sense of continuity  with the last three chapters. I was not only satisfied but also impressed. However, it is obvious that the movie had a much broader target audience, and this may be why some people disliked the light hearted  Jar Jar Binks.",1

I had yet to gain respect for the original three for their superb acting, cast, story, atmosphere and special effects and while watching this film through my adolescent mind, I thought it was an excellent action movie. The reason I perceived it to be good is because that is the age level that Lucas was aiming for. It is obvious that Lucas was going to make a fortune off the next three prequels and it appears that he decided to screw the fans of star wars and cash in on a mediocre piece of garbage.

The visual effects overwhelmed them movie completely and makes you wonder if those are even real actors on the screen and not just computer generated ones.

3597,,"I've had most people I know comment on this film. It has either been praise or the exact opposite - the feeling of being let down. I personally loved this film. When I first viewed it I too was not enthralled by it - but after I purchased it on dvd and watched it several times I found myself truly overjoyed with this film. Firstly, I am a child of the Star Wars era. I can remember when my mother bought me my Darth Vader figurine. I remember the shock of discovering that Luke and Leia were brother and sister and being dumbfounded that Darth Vader was Luke's father.  So naturally episode 1 was an experience I could not wait for. This film has a terrific storyline - we begin learning of the trade dispute and are introduced to the bad guys in the federation, Darth Maul and the future emperor Palpatine. It leads to the Gungans (a new race introduced by George Lucas) vs Droid battle. Also it has the beautiful heroine, brave warriors (Qui-Gon and Obi Won),a child blessed with the force and of course Joda.  I was spellbound by the special effects - the breathtaking pod race and the ultimate jedi battle. Wonderful, expressive characters like Watto - the owner of the slave Anakin and his mother - was great comic relief. I love that we learn that Darth Vader was a boy genius full of love and care for others and that makes you ponder that had he not met the Jedi he may not have caused all the problems he does in the galaxy. We also see Anakin being introduced to the mother of his children Padme. How thrilling. I suppose the only fault I can find is Jar Jar Binks, whilst hats off to Mr Lucas for thinking up such an interesting character I found his accent and his clumsiness a little hard to watch and not amusing.  That would be my only complaint. You don't however watch a Star Wars film for Oscar calibre acting - you watch them for the thrills and spills of the special effects and inventive storyline. The lead actors Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiamond supply the acting that is both subtle yet perfect for this film. Not to forgot Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker bringing back old favourites C3p0 and R2d2.After watching this film I am left breathlessly waiting for the next episode (Episode 2) to arrive. I will be there on opening night awaiting this film to open. I wait to see yet again great performances from Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman - also to see how Hayden Christenson portrays more of the boy who will become Darth Vader. Watch this film to remember dreams of childhood and the joy of the imagination.",1
3598,7.0,"Okay, it starts out a little slow, and, I'll admit It, I was a little worried at first, but in the end this is a very good sci-fi movie. It's main flaw is that the film lacks a central focus, like destroying the death star, escaping the empire etc. Instead, it's like a two-hour set up for the next two movies in the series. Aside from that, this is not the Godzilla bomb that some critics have made it out to be. Once the film gets to the pod race, about a third into the movie, it turns into a Star Wars movie that's really a lot of fun. In the final battle scene, Lucas shakes off the director's rust and delivers a tense, layered action scene worthy of Star Wars. Also, the performances are actually better than the original movies (Go back and check out some of Harrison Ford's work in the originals and cringe).",0
3599,9.0,"Without all of the negative reviews, Star Wars fans would have approached the film with unrealistic expectations.  Is this the best Star Wars film yet?  Probably not.  Does it live up to the standard of the Star Wars saga?  Absolutely.  It is true, that if you don't care for Star Wars, you probably won't like the movie.  (If you don't care for beef, you won't like hamburger either.)  Lucas achieves what is expected through stunning visual effects without the expense of good storytelling, and the greatest battles won by the most unlikely heroes.  It's everything a Star Wars film is supposed to be.  The action is a bit slow at first, but builds to a strong climax.  The only complaint:  Lucas needs to let his actors read the whole script. In places it seems the actors don't know where the story was going or where it had been.  This is rare however, and doesn't interfere with the overall enjoyment of the film",1

I have already seen it twice and it was even better the second time because there are so many small things I didn't notice the first time.

3603,9.0,All of the reviewers were wrong!  This movie is amazing! The interaction between the live-action and digital characters is extremely realistic. What the critics don't realize is that you can't attach some deep-seated psychological meaning to every breath the characters utter. A definite Oscar winner!,1
3604,9.0,Before I saw Star Wars the Phantom Menace I had heard some negative reviews about the movie.After seeing it however I really wonder what many of these people were thinking.While it wasn't as good of a movie as it was hyped up to be it was a lot of fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1
3605,1.0,"I hear Lucas delayed making this movie, until the current technology would allow him to fully express his vision. Well, apparently Lucas got so lost in playing with all his new special FX toys, he forgot to include little things like plot and characterization.   I was interested in none of the characters or what they were doing. A perfect example of this is Darth Maul.  What I really loved about the other movies was that Darth Vader was a true villain whom we could also get to know and understand.  For Darth Maul, however, Lucas seems to have just hired a martial artist, thrown him in a neat costume, and told him to jump around, look cool, and keep your mouth shut.",1
3606,10.0,"The movie was great.  Jar jar sucked, but the rest of the movie was wonderful.  Star wars movies have always set the standard for other movie makers when it comes to special effects.  No movie will ever come close to this for at least another year.  Lucas is a mastermind, and I commend his effort for this film.",0
3607,3.0,Seeing TPM yesterday afternoon was the most disappointing movie-going experience of my life.,0
3608,10.0,"It seems to me that ever since the original Star Wars every time a movie comes out with beautiful and well done special effects it's been lauded as nothing more then a light show, and now this phenomenon has come full circle.",1
3609,8.0,"From the start (well, almost), this movie was so full of cheese and attempts to be ""cute"" that I was repeatedly tempted to bust out laughing in the middle of it.  It seems so much more directed towards children than the original trilogy.  Don't get me wrong - everything that wasn't cheese was done well, outside of character development.  It didn't leave me really caring what happened to anybody, aside from a vague interest in the future of Sen. Palpatine.  The effects were mind-blowing, the storyline was fun, and the twists were pretty nifty.  It's just that there was so much CHEESE in the movie that enjoying it was tempered by wondering what idiotic thing would happen next.",0
3610,8.0,"I really enjoyed this movie. I really like the epic nature of it. This reminds me of epic stories such as the Hobbit/Lord of The Rings. There are parts that may seem slow, but are necessary in building the story. Sound and Visuals were incredible. The computer generated worlds looked so real. I was a bit disappointed in the acting job by young Skywalker. He lacked the feeling that was needed for many of the scenes.   I am eagerly awaiting the next episode.",1
3611,7.0,I would like to start this review on a positive note.  I loved the special effects.  I have never seen anything like them.  The fighting scenes between Jedi were the most awe-inspiring I have ever seen in any movie.,1
3612,10.0,"The critics are wrong, but then what is the use in saying that as it is generally always the case. Make up your own mind and see this film and you will not be disappointed. The story is simple for this is an introduction to a much larger story. The special effects are amazing and I felt the acting was great.",1
3613,8.0,Many critics seemed to have taken a disliking to this movie... and in some ways i can see why... but over all it's well worth seeing... (several times... it only gets better!),1
3614,9.0,"As I watched ""The Phantom Menace"" I felt that it had all the elements of the earlier trilogy.  When the action got intense, the film was perfect on cliff-hanging you and cutting to the next action sequence, like the way it did in ""Return Of The Jedi.""  The movie is definitely full of eye-candy special effects, and even hints at events to come in the next episode.  I was very satisfied, there was not a dull moment!  I look forward to the next episode!",1
3615,,"The original movies were great movies with mostly human element with some great special effects added in.  The Phantom Menace was a special effects nightmare with almost no human element.  I can't believe that so many have been fooled by this movie.  I am a huge Star Wars fan and have seen the originals over 1000 times easily.  All this movie was about was how Lucas could spend 85 million on special effects compared to the 10 million for the Third Episode.  The characters in this film were incredibly weak! The only one that was even admirable was Liam Neeson.  The voices of most of the droids and non-humans were incredibly annoying.  The music was made for a graduation party, not an epic saga.  There were no cool ships, no cool droids, and no cool costumes.  To say the least, I was extremely disappointed.  I can't believe Lucas made this film. It almost seemed like he tailored it to one segment of the population...the young children. Why did Lucas try making this movie a comedy? It wasn't funny. In fact, there wasn't anything funny about this film.  Lucas has let down all the fans that matter the most, the ones who put him on the map with Third Episode. Go see it to get it out of your system, but not too many will be going back again and again.  The only positive side of this is that I am going to save a lot of money because I know I will not be buying Star Wars figures and ships. I will not support this film and Lucas' attempt to once again monopolize the toy industry with such a weak movie. The force was definitely not with Lucas on this one. Hopefully the next director will get this saga back on track.",0
3616,10.0,"In a single word... Awesome!  Without giving any of the movie away for those few who might not have seen it yet, Episode I is right there with the other Star Wars movies.  In fact, this movie may actually answer some of the more trivial questions which fans might have been wondering about throughout the three first movies.  The story is very well put together and the special effects are simply out of this world.  I truly recommend this movie to all who enjoy action and sci-fi movies.",1
3617,2.0,"The movie has horrible acting from anakin, padme, and the kid anakin is not good either but that's probably to be expected. Jar Jar is such a cringy character he just alone almost ruins this movie. There is a really long and boring pod racing plot and almost the whole set is cgi. This movie just isn't good. The light saber fights are the only thing keeping this movie from being a 1 star.",0
3618,10.0,"I got to be in the 12 o clock screening of the movie and it was electric in the audience.  We cheered, laughed, and applauded throught the whole thing. I want to post a few negative things people I go to school with talk about and my answers.",1
3619,3.0,(No spoilers in this review),0
3620,9.0,"Let me just say, the critics obviously have a bug lodged somewhere when it comes to this franchise.  I found this movie fast paced, and visually stunning.  Honestly, did Lucas ever promise anything more than a wild ride? Did he say a lot about famous death scenes (Braveheart)or famous love scenes (Titanic)?  NO!  He promised us a special effect laden Star Wars Episode, and he delivered it.  I had a blast watching it, and will see it many more times.  If I remember, reviews of the first Star Wars was less than positive.  Look how that turned out.  Without a grand mythology for our technically and scientifically based society, it is a pleasure to be able to see out knights, and princesses.  Our dragons and Sorcery.  Now its just used in a futuristic fashion.  Plus Lucas even placed a conspiracy for X-File fans.  Go see the movie, ignore the critics.",1
3621,10.0,"I just saw Star Wars - The Phantom Menace at a midnight showing last Tuesday night.  I would have to say that this movie was nothing short of spectacular.  For months now, everybody has been talking about the special effects and the sound quality of this movie, but you have to see it to actually appreciate what Lucas has done.  I've heard from a few people that the movie has sacrificed dialogue and story quality while focusing more on special effects.  I totally disagree with this.  It is true that Jar Jar Binks gets a little too much screen time for a character of his type, but I really don't think the movie suffers from this.",1
3622,10.0,"In my opinion, this movie lived up to the hype.  While there were a few awkward moments I was enthralled from start to finish by the history, the story and the characters.  As expected the visual effects and battle scenes are mind-boggling.  This movie is not perfect, but neither was Episode 4. I think the Phantom Menace gives us about as much as we could have asked for, and then some.  I can't wait for 2002!",1
3623,8.0,"If you're able to avoid the critics and just sit back and watch the movie, I have no doubt you'll enjoy it.  Take it for what it is:  A sci-fi, fantasy film for kids 15 and under...just like the first three installments!  Its a good idea to watch the first three (if you don't already have them memorized) before seeing The Phantom Menace, because some background knowledge will add to your understanding and enjoyment of the picture.  Of course the special effects were beyond imagination, but I don't think it took anything away from the story.  I've only seen it once, and I can't wait to see it again.  In fact, I'm ready for II and III!",0
3624,,"This movie shows that Mr. Lucas is now rather a businessman than an artist. This film is for kids, a 2 Hour computer game, a feast of special effects. Do not have any doubts: this movie is about Money. That's all. Oh yeah, the podracer and the lightsaber scenes are cool. And what? There was a few cool scenes even in Soldier, but the film sucked. This film also sucks. It lacks the spirit that New Hope and Empire had. The commercialization of the whole Lucas Empire started with the Jedi, with all the silly ewoks and the monsters in Jabba's Palace. But even Jedi was a better film than Menace.",0
3625,8.0,"If you understand this move as the retelling of classic myth, it works quite well.",1
3626,,"This movie ROCKS!! Don't let the critics detract from your experience. There *IS* a plot, there *ARE* characters who develop somewhat. Sure, it may be one long ""trailer"" for the next two, but it it certainly a good starting point for the new trilogy. Critics make it out to be something that is weak and thin in plot & development, but you have to know Star Wars enough to really appreciate what's going on. Look past the special effects and you can see where Lucas is going to take this thing.",0
3627,1.0,"Objectively this isn't the worst movie ever made, but I've never been more disappointed. I waited a generation for THIS???",0
3628,9.0,"I wouldn't advise reading this unless you've seen the movie, because I'll probably give things away.  I think one of the key issues when critiquing this movie is ""what was the overall point of this movie?""  The point was to introduce Anakin, set it up so that Obi-Wan would train him as a Jedi, set it up so that Anakin could also be trained as a Dark Jedi, and, most importantly, to put Palpatine in charge of the Senate.  And I think the movie did an excellent job of accomplishing those goals.  Did I understand all that rigamarole with taxing and trade lanes and the Trade Federation? No, but I don't think it was important.  It was just a political ploy Palpatine was using.  Was I bothered by Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin Skywalker?  At first I was, and then I remembered that he's playing a nine-year old kid, not an adult.  And in that respect, I think Jake Lloyd does all right.  Granted, he is playing the child version of the most quintesciential screen villain, but why does that mean we should expect some complex character as a nine-year old boy?  We idealize children as being young, sweet, and innocent, and Anakin's character just lives up to that ideal.  When Anakin first appeared on screen, the friend I was seeing it with said, ""He's CUTE.""  So much the better.  Would it seem more tragic for a cute, bright, talented, gifted, idealistic boy to be broken in such a way that he turns to the Dark Side, or for some hideously deformed bully to decide that killing people is cool and he'd rather be a Dark Jedi than a good one?  And I think that's why Anakin's character is the way it is in the movie. As for the much maligned Jar-Jar Binks, I was expecting much worse. Granted, most of the time I was not amused by his antics, I did find some of them funny.  And at least C3P0 and R2D2 were there to provide better comic relief. Granted, no characters from this movie are nearly as memorable as the ones from the original trilogy.  That might change, that might not in the next 2 movies. The visual effects were downright awesome.  There were times when I felt my jaw drop at some of the scenes, and that didn't happen in Jurassic Park or Independence Day.  And the Jedi fights are spectacular.  I'm glad I saw it and I have every intention of seeing it as many times as I possibly can.",1
3629,10.0,"When Star Wars hit it transported viewers to a wonderful place and time that was beyond imagination.  A land of magical forces, good versus evil, powerful fates, and endless adventure.  For all the years after it's sequels we've been longing to return again. The wait is over and it's as grande and engulfing as ever.  The movie cannot be described, it must be felt.  If you are among the legions who love 4, 5, and 6, then you will be in heaven.  Actually, better yet, a galaxy far, far, away.   It is adventure, myth, action, character, heart, soul, and dreams in the most glorious potpurri possible.  Once again our hearts can sour and minds fly to faraway places.  Once again we meet the Jedi in all their glory.  Once again the Force is truly  with us.",1
3630,,"As the Phantom Menace drew to its finale, I thought to myself how nostalgia seems to have been the driving ""creative"" force behind much of the action and its motivation depicted on the screen. For a movie that was not supposed to be ""Star Wars"", it sure borrowed quite heavily from it.",0
3631,10.0,"I read with great interest the various movie critics' view of the movie and I was left with the impression that the critics didn't remember the original Star Wars trilogy very well.  Watching the film only reinforced my opinion. If you are wanting this movie to have wonderfully developed characters and a fabulous plot on it's own, I think you are going to the wrong movie. Taken as a prequel, the movie does not necessarily need to have those things; rather that's the purpose of the whole series of movies, in my opinion.",0
3632,10.0,"I don't know what the critics were thinking when they reviewed Episode One (assuming they actually *saw* the film). I already think it's the best of the four existing movies, and I can't wait for Episodes II and III.  I thought the special effects were great, and the sound was the best, especially during the podrace!  The lightsaber fights were THE best ever in all of the movies.  Kudos to Ray Parker for his performance during those fights.  I thought the acting was good too, despite",1
3633,10.0,"This movie rocked. If you're a fan of the Star Wars movies at all, you will agree. Critics and other viewers have criticized it's non-existent faults mainly because either 1) in order for the movie to live up to its hype, the messiah would have to appear and walk off the screen or 2) they're unhappy fault-finders, intent on bashing a movie that has blown away anything else produced this decade. One note for you all, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, was bashed by critics and movie-goers alike when it came out. Funny that now it's one of the most popular movies of all time...I'll end on that note.",0
3634,10.0,"I don't know what is wrong with those people who say The Phantom Menace is not worth of being called a Star Wars movie, because this movie was AMAZING!!! I don't see how you can't like this movie!  It is so much fun!! I think the people who don't like it have lost all sense of FUN in their lives because that's the only excuse there is! There was not one bad thing about this movie (AND I LOVED JAR JAR) this isn't Citizen Kane, you don't watch this movie scrutinizing every little thing, you're supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy!! Critics and Fans who don't like this, I really think you need to rediscover what the word FUN means and see this movie with an open mind because obviously you haven't!!!",1
3635,10.0,"While trying to compare this film to the original trilogy is a waste of time in my opinion, I can definitely say that TPM is easily the best sci-fi movie since Jedi, and is a great addition to the series.  Just watching the opening scroll gave me chills.  I feel bad for the person who was expecting top-notch acting, or an ""adult"" movie, because those people obviously didn't get the point of the original movies.  Star Wars is about having fun while telling a great story with a lot of action.  The original Star Wars gave movie making a much needed boost towards quality effects and sound, and this movie should do it again.  If you don't like this movie, you must not have really liked the originals.  Thanks for your time!",1
3636,9.0,"In 1977, Star Wars Episode IV changed the way we think about movies. George Lucas summed up the film nicely saying, ""We were making a fairy tale for a generation that had none."" The effects were spell-binding, the acting was poor (excepting Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher), and the story inspired us all. The film broke ground that few sci-fi films since have built anything meaningful upon.",0
3637,10.0,This movie is incredible.  My only problem is the critics who think they are high and mighty.  They've been widely putting Episode I down.  They are the only people who have had expectations higher than any movie could reach. The only way for George Lucas to make a bad Star Wars movie would be for him to TRY to make a bad movie.,0
3638,9.0,"I must say that I really did enjoy this movie, and I won't have any spoilers in here if you want to enjoy it yourself.  I have heard critics say that it had a ""Phantom"" plot, but I could NOT disagree more.

Jar Jar and the leaders of the Trade Federation were the most annoying things I have seen on the movie screen in a while.  I didn't hate this movie.  It definitely picked up when the pod racing began, but I was hoping the movie would be a bit more serious.  The way everything started to unfold at the ending worked very good and I was very interested and seeing that part.  But the lightsaber duel was uninspirational, at least Luke broke a sweat when battling Vader.  I just feel that the movie needed less comedy and more dramatic turns.",0

3641,9.0,"my favorite movie is dr. strangelove. i enjoy movies that have what critics call ""artistic value"". Of course, I do not look at movies as one dimensionally as some. I also enjoy science fiction. Critics have bashed the phantom menace for its lack of artistic value. If you are going to see star wars for it's artistic merit, don't bother. the characters are poorly developed, the dialogue sucks. Even the some computer generated characters are not rendered that well (particularly with close ups). that being said, i have to say WHO CARES. i did not go to see star wars with the same expectations i have from a stanley kubrick, woody allen, or krzyszlof kieslowski film. the phantom menace is an incredibly FUN movie to go watch. 2001 was definitely a better FILM, but the phantom menace was certainly more fun to go see, and if i had to choose one or the other to watch with some friends on a weekend, i would choose star wars every time. critics are stupid because they think movies can all be judged by the same standards, but there are categories of movies and they should not be judged the same. the phantom menace is in many ways a kid movie, but there is plenty to keep everyone interested. even jar jar binks is not as annoying as i thought he would be. i have plenty of problems with this movie, but all the greatest works are flawed. that is not to say that star wars is the best movie ever, but i had as much fun watching it as i did watching the originals when i was a kid. 9/10",1

Before it's release critics (i.e. people paid to disagree) were giving the movie a bad review. What I heard was it lacked the heart of the first three or there wasn't a character like Han or some other reference to the original three. It's a new movie, a new story, and therefore, should differ from the original trilogy. If it were the same then the complaint would be the movie wasn't original. Anyway, the effects alone could have carried the movie even with out a story. I enjoyed the story because it sets up the next two perfectly.",1
3643,,"Well, I've seen it twice now and I have to say that I am completely confused by what it was that the critics were watching. This film, although not the greatest work of cinema ever, is none the less much better in every way than the original three. I'll explain: I'm not even going to talk about the special effects, because that goes without saying. The interaction of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon is breath taking and extremely deep. Where we had mindless panic induced banter in the first three between Luke, Lea and Han we have two sober Jedi who move through this film much in the way that Kain moved through the original Kung-Fu series.",0

I don't want to sound repetitive, but most of the negative reviews found in the major daily papers across North America were right and I agreed whole heartedly with them. However, upon a second viewing I found the film not to be as flat and devoid of the rich Star Wars layers we've all come to know and love, rather, I found a lot more subtlety, complexity and humanity. Jar Jar is still annoying, don't get me wrong, the film still has problems, but they're minor in comparison to viewing the picture as the first chapter of a six part series. Anyway, these comments have been left for those of you who didn't like it...I suggest you see it again, you may gain a new perspective.",1

Yes, Jar Jar was annoying and I hope we don't see him in the next two installments.  Yes, the 'immaculate conception' of Anakin caused laughs in the theater and sounded just a little too hokey.",0
3655,10.0,"Having seen the Phantom Menace 15 times since it's release, and having been entertained slightly more, each and every time, I feel that I can reasonably argue that Episode I is the best Star Wars film currently available. The special effects are literally out of this world, and George Lucas' return to directing is both welcome and surprising: Surprising in that, after such a long layoff, his techniques and cuts are still sharp. The script flows across the screen at a clip that can easily keep pace with the original classic trilogy, and it has an added bonus. Humor. This is the funniest Star Wars movie as well. As for the acting; hmm... let's think about this. Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor, or Harrison, Mark and Carrie. No disrespect to the latter three (who are all great talents) but Neeson is an A-list actor, who's unflappable calm is the glue throughout the film. McGregor is genuinely sweet as Obiwan and if anyone at the age of 16 can claim the same maturity and poise as Portman, I salute you. Overall, The Phantom Menace is exactly what it should be, a fun film, an adventure of cinema escape, in the Lucas tradition, which only the master himself can duplicate.And for anyone that hasn't seen the lightsaber duel between Qui Gon, Obiwan and Darth Maul. Go. Now! That battle is heartpounding, easily the most intense sequence in the entire saga and my favorite moment in the history of cinema.",1

I was only like 1 year old at the time, so I missed out on that.  The first time I saw it was on a video tape, and I had already seen the first one or two Star Trek movies by that time, so it didn't seem nearly as groundbreaking to me in terms of special effects, etc.  But I did see The Phantom Menace today, and it was indeed groundbreaking.  I think I felt the same thing, seeing it, that older people felt seeing the original.  I believe this movie sets a new standard for science-fiction action sequences and special effects, and there were parts that brought out deep emotions in me, without being boring.",1

Not once did I look at my watch wondering how long the movie was.  The visual effects were spectacular.  Lucas has stepped up the notch for computer animation.  A few times I had to remind myself that the character where computer animated! I can't wait for the next two movies and see what George Lucas comes up with!",0

There are no words to describe how much I hate this character. Had I been able to just UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TOAD WAS SAYING, then other flaws would be forgivable. At this point, the only forgiveness for Mr. Lucas will come if, in Episode 2, Mr. Binks is dead, floating in a jar jar.. .",0

It was the fourth greatest movie of all time behind the other three star wars movies. I will admit that some of the acting was not great.  It was fair.  It though still had some good supporting actors and was quite exciting.  I give this movie a huge 10 and suggest that everyone who has not seen it goes see it soon.",1

These lightsaber duels they got in Episode 1 blow away anything I've ever seen before, including the battles in the original three StarWars.  You thought Return of the Jedi was awesome when Luke and Darth Vader finally duked it out for the lightsaber battle to end all lightsaber battles...think again.  Darth Maul is incredible, he takes on both Jedi at once with his double-edged red lightsaber.  Oh man is he good.  The fighting is so fast and furious you will forget to breathe until it's all over.

I was still disappointed from what the previews pumped the movie up to be, and the digital animation took something away from the original.

You will understand things in the original three that you wouldn't have understood had this movie never been released.",0

3667,9.0,"There were a lot of negative reviews of this film.  I don't believe any of them and neither should you.  Of course the effects were amazing, but the actors were just as good.  When I saw Ewan McGregor, I swore that he was a young Alec Guinness.  He was that good.  Jake Lloyd, who took a lot of heat, played exactly what he is; a ten year old boy standing on the brink of something so great that he is just awed by it.  Even Jar Jar made me laugh! THe fight scenes between Qui-Gonn, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul are classic.  In short, the critics dropped the ball on this one.  Everyone in the theater thought that is was a worthy beginning to the legendary saga.",1
3668,9.0,"This movie is definitely a great movie.  However, to live up to the hype that has surrounded it is impossible.  For Star Wars fans, it is important to understand that going in the theatre with a preconception of what the movie will be like may be disappointing.  If you are open and willing to watch a movie that challenges your ideas about ""the force"" and other things, then you will probably love this movie.",1
3669,,"Anyone who was over 12 in 1979 should recognize what's going on out there.  The devoted Star Wars fans are behaving just like the hard core Star Trek fans did when their first movie came out.  When the next installment or two come out ... if they're ever made and if they're not atrocious embarrassments like this one ... even the fans will admit TPM was the worst of the series and an awful film standing alone.  I've overheard strolling groups of fans mumbling to each other: ""this is *exactly* the film he *had* to make!""  It's deja vu all over again.  (Coincidence?  TPM is an anagram for TMP).",0
3670,9.0,"No matter what critics say, I personally enjoyed this movie a great deal. I loved the fast pace (which was one thing critics didn't like): the viewer doesn't have time to rest, to take a breath, and is therefore drawn into the action. The settings were gorgeous, the costumes breathtaking, and the battle scenes... well, they were pure Star Wars, through and through. The music, thanks to the brilliant John Williams, is of course magnificent (I have already bought the soundtrack and listen to it constantly). All of the actors did wonderfully, especially adorable Jake Lloyd (yet again, critics don't know what they are talking about!). It had everything that makes a Star Wars movie: action, adventure, drama, and heart, all wrapped up in a beautiful, fantastic world that pleases the eye and captures the imagination. Bravo to George Lucas!!!",1
3671,9.0,"Awesome! The sound was incredible; the visuals were stunning; the stunts indescribable! While Jar Jar Binks is somewhat annoying, the way he blended in with the completely live action characters was impressive (most impressive). This film lays what seems a good foundation for the saga; I can't wait for the next one. The film also had a good pace, not too fast, not too slow. A lot of story to tell, I wasn't sure they'd get to it all. I'll see this one again, something I did not do for the others (even Special Edition) and rarely do for ANY film.",1
3672,10.0,"I believe that The Phantom Menace has lived up to any expectations the original Star Wars movies have set forth.  The cast puts on an overwhelming performance, and George Lucas succeeds wonderfully at creating enchanting and visually stunning new Star Wars worlds.  I was absolutely mesmorized by the exceedingly beautiful Natalie Portman in her role as Padmé and as Queen Amidala.  When you watch this movie as a Star Wars fan since you were 8 years of age, it's super exciting to hear people on the big screen talk about 'Skywalker' and not see Luke in the picture.  And also, meeting Luke and Leia's grandmother was pretty neat.  You don't have to be a fan to love this movie though.  The Phantom Menace has converted anti-Star Wars people into true fans.",1
3673,10.0,"Hi!! all I saw the phantom menace today and my oppinion is this movie is wonderful ""it's a kick ass movie"". There are some disappointments but what tha heck nothing can be perfect not even a starwars film. It's all up to yourself how many expectations you have and so on. But all those critics that didn't like the movie or gave it very low grades must have been blind or something like that....I recommend this film to everyone it's very good... Go see it i promise you it's worth it..",1
3674,10.0,"This isn't just a movie..this is part of history..Why you ask? This  is because this movie has mostly everything people want in a movie, no nudity nor swearing.

This is a movie everyone has to see more than once",1
3675,9.0,"What a terrific show!  I cannot see how critics can drag this film down. It has everything, but most importantly...it's fun! Numerous events in the film beautifully and clearly foreshadow events yet to come in the series. I must say that this, for the most part is a praising review.",1
3676,10.0,"This movie is near perfect, except for the small fact that nearly all the scenes (and the plot) are too much like Episode IV: A New Hope. Its rescue princess (or Queen in this case) and have Sith Lord strike down old Jedi while apprentice watches. And the award ceromony at the end... Hello where have we seen that before. Of course Episode II & III will probably not be like Episodes V & VI as Anakin will probably marry Padme (which will make her name... Queen Padme Nabeere Amilda Skywalker[and to think that people found Obi-Wan Kenobi hard to say at first]) and then eventually fall into the Dark Side. All in all a very good movie (It has too many Special Effects for its own good) which copies the original (which isn't neccesarily a bad thing as that was an ab-fab movie in it's own rights) but the events in a different order except for the last. You'll love it you have a) never seen the original or b) if you love the original. You won't like it if you hated the original.",1

3678,10.0,"This movie is truly great.  It is comparable to the original triology in special effects innovation, humor, adventure, mystery, characters, etc. yet still not any more derivative than a story so closely linked to the originals could be.  I loved the chance to experience a new star wars movie while it was still new.  The energy surrounding this film is contagious and I urge you all to go see it.",1
3679,,"The best thing about this movie was watching it with my 6 year old son. Who cares how it developed characters or set-up a sense of urgency. When I saw Star Wars as a 10 year old, I left the theater just as my son left today---in awe and a fan for life!",1
3680,6.0,"Some people have said this movie is for the kids.  I think not.  I would defy any child (or adult) to describe too many details about what they'd just seen.  Why?  Because this has to be one of the worst recorded movies (soundwise) ever made.  The characters tend to have strange accents and voices to begin with, and yet in virtually all scenes containing dialogue, there is background music being played, it at a level of about 10 decibels, while the voices are at about 7.  -""What'd he say?  What'd he say??""",0
3681,3.0,"Where to start. I guess first off I have to say I really enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it as a kid. As I grew I noticed more and more things wrong with it, and each time I re-watched it I saw it clearer for what it really is. A really poorly written movie with characters that never felt real and were not relatable. Also would like to add this isn't an 100% complete review because of the word limit.",0
3682,8.0,The movie went very fast and felt compressed.  I felt like I didn't get to know anyone.  An additional 30 minutes added to the film to help expand the characters a little more would make the film almost perfect.,0
3683,7.0,"I liked the movie. How could I not. I'm a Star Wars fan. But I think that there is too much emphasis on the technology involved in making the film and not on the actors involved in making the film. I think that Jar Jar was annoying and not ""real"" enough. His voice and animation were terrible. Too much movement! I would have preferred a live actor in a suit, similar to Chewbacca. Voice choices for the the battle droids was terrible also. Too comic and not threatening enough.",0
3684,9.0,"I told someone else that ""It was good when I was in the movie theatre, when I was walking back to my car it was really good, and when I got home I couldn't wait to see it again."" The special effects are... amazing. Naboo was so beautiful I wished I could live there, and Coruscant was an amazing image of what Earth will be in a thousand years or so (It will!) That's kind of a problem at the same time- I was so in awe at the FX that I kind of missed the MOVIE. I think that's what Lucas was going for- Now I have to go see it again. There wasn't a lot of action, but the main action scene was so amazing I wanted them to play it over again. I mean, DOUBLE SIDED LIGHTSABER. That's awesome.",1
3685,9.0,"I see a movie every week or two and only 3 times have I gone to see a movie twice. In 1986 I saw Aliens twice, in 1995 I saw Braveheart twice and in 1999 I have seen the Phantom Menace twice.",1

What I find very strange though, is that this movie appears to be made for no one. I think young kids will get bored watching this movie. It is very slow at points, not at all what I expected. Their is a lot of dialog about the trade war among the characters, but none of it makes any sense. They talk about groups that we are never allowed to see or get to know, or like... I think adults will be confused and bored with this, not to mention small kids that want to see cool stuff and characters.",0
3687,10.0,"With the unbelievable hype, and media circus, it's no wonder that some people are feeling let down by this movie. Their ridiculous expectations have jaded their judgment and made them cynical.",0
3688,7.0,"I thought the movie was quite good. I felt the story was there, but it needed to focus more on Anakin than the trade dispute itself. I mean, I didn't wait 16 years to worry about the inhabitants of Naboo. I felt that the Tattoine section of the film and the political maneuvering on Coruscant were the best parts. Watto and Sebullah were excellent characters, very fun to watch. I was disappointed that Darth Maul was not given more dialogue and developed more thoroughly. He was almost a non-event, which is a pity, considering he has all the potential of being a great movie villain.",1
3689,7.0,"The grandeur of the film starts at the Pod Race. The pace picks up and the movie takes off becoming a film worthy of belonging to the Star Wars epic. The story stumbles on its way there. It seems too fast, too cutty. The story doesn't give itself time to unfold. Anakin (who's acting is one of the film's shortcomings, next to the unintelligibility of Jar Jar Binks) falls in love too quickly with Padme, for instance. He too into her with not so much as a moment of contemplation leading up to it. The settings shift without flow. The characters are not being built so much as displayed. It's not until the Pod Race that you're comfortable enough with the characters to fall in love with them. For then on perfection takes over and the magic engulfs you. Unlike most people, I don't hate Jar Jar as much as I had too much trouble understanding what he says. He almost needs subtitles. But even his mumbling clears up after the Pod Race. All in all, I liked the film and will probably see it again, but felt like I had to get into it rather then being yanked in.",0
3690,,"The Phantom Menace is a BAD movie.  The plot is underdeveloped, the direction is callous, the dialogue is campy, the acting is uninspired, and the movie as a whole is severely over-edited.  It has the scope of a three-hour epic, but has been condensed to fit a standard two-hour time slot.  In the process, it has lost valuable screen time necessary for developing key characters and building tension.",0
3691,10.0,"I was also privileged to see this movie on what is touted to be the largest screen in Texas.  All I can say is: the Special Effects were good eye-candy (although not as good as the Matrix which, with it's highly original plot, edges TPM as my favourite movie this year).  The sound was awesome.  My teeth rattled with every passing star cruiser.",1
3692,8.0,"I was thrilled to finally see The Phantom Menace.  I think Jar Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker received a little too much screen time for my tastes, and their respective ""cute"" type humor could have been toned down. (Kids will probably enjoy it though.)",1
3693,1.0,"After viewing the great movie ""The Force Awakens"" again last week I thought, let's watch the whole series again. When I was young I loved the original trilogy and 30 years later these movies are still fantastic. But for some reason I never got into episode I-III. I couldn't remember why, but now I know, Episode I is so bad, it completely erased all my interest in Episode II and Episode III. I will rewatch II and III also this week and maybe they aren't that bad as Episode I is. I can't understand how so many people can give this trash such a high rating. Watch Jar Jar for 10 seconds and all is ruined. The worst thing is, Jar Jar is in for the whole movie. Then Anakin, this is Sesame Street meets Home Alone. What a disaster.",1
3694,8.0,"I saw this movie last night.  About half-way through, I realized I had already been subjected to Jar-Jar Binks and a good deal of the boyish Vader's acting ability.  I was content.  I knew I had the star battle and the light saber duel ahead of me.  I was then truly happy.  THIS IS STAR WARS!!  It follows the formula so well (with just a little TOO much Jar-Jar).  The acting was on par for the series, and the story was a mix of the first three.  This sets up for Episodes 2 and 3, and does a great job in doing so.  I had heard that this was mostly for the kids, but I'm sorry, when I take my 11 year old brother to this in the next week, he won't understand jack about the trade federation and how involved the ""menace"" is in this movie.  He will enjoy the sights and sounds of the film, I would bet you on that.  This movie works on so many levels, but the only level it needs to work on and succeeds at is the Star Wars level.  I would rate this movie as good as ""RoTJ"", and I liked it MORE than ""Star Wars"".  See this movie, and relish it.",1
3695,8.0,"The movie people waited sixteen years for is finally here.  All the anticipation, the hype, waiting in line for hours.  Now the movie we've waited for so long is here and everyone's disappointed.  I can't quite put my finger on the exact reasons why.  I've heard it's because there's no story, no character development, and Jar Jar Binks.  I've read almost every pan and every gripe by every critic.  And all the while I keep thinking. God, I'm thankful I'm not George Lucas.  All you whiners who are disappointed and complaining should keep in mind, that the original Star Wars, which everyone compares Menace to, did not have to stand up under the intense scrutiny this film has.  And believe me, it wouldn't have. Phantom Menace has so much baggage attached to it.  It's the first Star Wars movie in sixteen years, it has to introduce a new trilogy and new characters, lay the groundwork for future storylines, and make the first movie a satisfying entry that can stand with the other three films.  I'm not saying this is the greatest movie ever made (Empire still holds that title), but it's such a quantum leap in imagination and storytelling over so-called blockbusters like Godzilla, Armageddon, ID4, Jurassic Pak, Lost World, etc.  Two hours in a Lucas universe beats two hours spent in any of these movies hands down. I will not describe the plot or any of its details.  Personally, I thought the characters were good, well-drawn and mostly well acted.  Neeson was the best, but Jake Lloyd was also a nice surprise.  The story drops hints about characters and what we can expect they will do in the next two episodes. My friends and I have been talking about this movie endlessly, debating where the events Lucas has set in motion will lead us.  Now, I know some will still not like the movie no matter what.  That's your choice.  But the widespread negativity by critcs and fickle fans has been depressing to me, because we finally have what we wanted and now everybody's mad.  Star Wars is back and George Lucas has been good enough to take us back.  Let's just enjoy it.",1
3696,,"I would have to say the movie is absolutley everything I expected, but that isn't exactly a good thing. The special effects were incredible, just as I expected, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen, but I expected the story to be faulty and evidently made up (also known as corny) which is exactly what it was. You can make up stories around anything, even Star Wars. George Lucas said he would make the movie when computers caught up with his ideas, which they obviously did, but he also needed to concentrate on writing a screenplay that was gripping,realistic,emotionally involving, and above all halfway believable. I also thought the film focused way to much on what will happen in the next installments to come, instead of what is happening. Lucas should have written it as if it could survive by itself, it looks more like Episodes 1,2, and 3 will all be one big movie separated into 3 parts. What I'm really saying is if you enjoy such films as The Matrix and The Mummy you will love this movie, if you don't, see it, but lower your expectations.",1
3697,10.0,"The Phantom Menace is the best movie I've seen since The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas' genius is once again revealed in this stunning addition to the already popular Star Wars family. I've seen the movie several times and plan on seeing it many more. The acting was top notch and casted perfectly. Lucas' brilliant team of CG artists and model makers have truly created a masterpiece. A must-see film for people of all ages, fans of Star Wars or not. And now I anxiously await Episode Two.",1

I saw it the first time and I was SO excited, I was only mildly impressed.  After seeing it again without the anticipation, I realized that it was a GREAT movie, visually stunning, full of action and fun.  Many people need to remember that this isn't 1977 and this Star Wars wasn't released as part of a trilogy.  No one knew if there was going to be an Empire Strikes Back, the movie was made as a standalone.  It isn't fair to compare Episode IV and Episode I.  Also since Episode I is definitely part of a trilogy, it doesn't answer all the questions, in fact I think it raised more then it answered.  This is good because I am anticipating Episode II and III.  Lucas however did make this movie MUCH more visually stunning then the other three.  It is definitely a Star Wars for a new generation.",1

If the answer is yes (or maybe even if it's no, if you loved the first two), go for Phantom Menace, too.",1
3702,6.0,"My expectations were definitely too high, based on the original three films. Yet, the film really wasn't that bad, the acting was decent, Jar Jar Binks wasn't as annoying as I thought he'd be.  But due to the fact that two more films are on the way, Lucas could only show us so much.  The pod race scene, and the duel with Darth Maul, a scary bozo like entity, were wonderful; but Ewan McGregor, a great actor, could have been used better.  Natalie Portman, only 17, was great as Padme, but trite as Queen Amidala, while Samuel Jackson seemed only to be thrown in to put a minority, aka black person, in the film, there were only two that I noticed.  I couldn't stop thinking of Pulp Fiction, Ezekiel 25:17 during his brief on screen presence.  This first episode, spoon fed us and yet I want the entree now.  Patience will have to be my right hand man as Episode II and III are several years away.",0
3703,2.0,"Yes, George - plot really *does* matter.  For the most wildly anticipated movie of all time, ""The Phantom Menace"" is surprisingly inept, unengaging, sloppy and noxiously annoying.  Ignoring such matters as a coherent story line or vivid personality in favor of overdone, omnipresent and fake-looking special effects, George Lucas has essentially eradicated everything that made the first three films such classics.  There is no chemistry, no emotional pull, no sense of adventure or urgency; a bunch of things happen for no particular reason, and then the credits roll.  It's dull and flat, desperately in need of the Buck Rogers-style gee-whiz spirit of ""A New Hope"" or the darkness and rich texture of ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  The movie looks tacky, the visuals don't mesh properly, and every scene lurches around until it fizzles out - there are a lot of awkward pauses to distract us from the God-awful dialogue.  And, despite a good cast, there is nary a character of interest - even Yoda has been rendered a simplistic cartoon, and the Jedi, oddly, have been de-mystified so much that Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi seem like Batman & Robin.  But, of course, everyone loves it - yet another automatic response engineered by Lucas' powerhouse marketing campaign.  A toxic embarrassment.  Score: 2 out of 10.",0

But I am sure all the ""hard core"" fans will say this is good, no matter what they really think.  My advice is to wait a week or two, when word gets out you won't have to wait in line like I did!",0
3705,10.0,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) George Lucas has done it again!!! He's allowed us to take a look at how the Star Wars Saga has started in a galaxy far far away.... The movie starts off with some brilliant visual effects and then it shifts into a story with adventure and danger around every corner. The characters in TPM gives an added element to the story by showing their struggle against an attacking force while many answers to the Star Wars galaxy are being laid out before us. TPM uses these characters to slow some elements of the story and block other elements completely. The mixture of characters and story allow the plot to be given to us at a reasonable pace and adds to our desire to see the next movie(Episode II). 5 out of 5 stars,1
3706,,"Utterly fantastic, for what it is. The stories in this series are simple, the acting not very deep, but the settings are literally out of this world. The scope of this movie jumps from planet to planet, and the attention to detail is simply stunning. There is always something happening.

When certain main characters are in danger, become injured, or die, the characters fail to react, and so the audience too is unable to sympathize.",0

You giveth and you taketh away for what I once loved you have now ruined.Star wars had so much potential and now it's all just toy commercials, 90 minute toy commercials. Build a set, go to a location , way too much blue screen in this movie.As much as they put into the fx they just didn't feel as authentic as the originals.

Amidala alone pays attention to what Jar Jar has to say and refrains from bagging on him, even when everybody else does, including the droids. In my humble opinion, Jar Jar represents the innocence that both Qui-Gon and Amidala are sworn to protect.",1

They're of the same breed as the critics who panned the original trilogy.  It should have said something to all of the public that these guys broke their word and released reviews before they were supposed to.

It was there, but it was much more subtle.  Don't get me wrong, the film had great potential but it just didn't live up to it.  Kind of like listening to Chopin play chop sticks.

It is very good, and for me, gets better with each viewing. The cast is great, with Neeson, Portman and McDiarmid outstanding in their roles. Jake Lloyd was fine, but McGregor will have to wait for the next chapter to let loose on Obi-Wan. Jar Jar Binks was fine, but the greatest CG character was, by far, Watto- he almost stole every scene he was in. The battle scenes could have been a little more exciting- there was almost too much going on to focus on the conflict. All in all, pretty damn good- and we still have the best yet to come.",1
3721,10.0,"Despite some initial criticism, Episode 1 has proved itself to be quite the model of what a blockbuster should be.  In regards to the storyline, it is absolutely brilliant.  Of course nobody will fully know how the trilogy unfolds until 2005, most of the subtleties in Episode 1 are clearly clues to the grand scheme.  For example, Anakin's virgin birth has received a bit too much criticism considering that people can't see the full picture.  I submit the possibility that Anakin is a clone, or was simply engineered for that matter for a darker purpose.  He said himself they didn't move to Tatooine until he was three, and Shmi Skywalker gives a look of concern when Qui-Gon says, ""had he been born in the republic we would have identified him early."" And what about that curious glare Yoda and Mace Windu exchange after Qui-Gon suggests he has encountered a vergence in the Force around a Tatooine slave boy.  Clearly there is more here than meets the eye. Considering that future Star Wars episodes involve ""The Clone Wars,"" I think that Anakin just might be one of the first.  This would justify the concept of the midichlorians, afterall it allows for an efficient way to manufacture beings with strong Jedi or Sith potential.  The cloning theory also justifies the virgin birth concept, because all clones need a womb to grow in, a single host without a ""father"" by all conventional terms.  As for Jar Jar Binks, I agree there were moments when he was a bit too much, but all in all he was not THAT bad.  Sure he had his ups and downs, but is ""exsqueeze me"" any worse than Chewbacca swinging onto a scout walker with the Tarzan call in Return of the Jedi?  We enjoy these movies because they bring out the child in us, and their shortcomings are what make them all the more personal.  It's like The Goonies: far from flawless, but genuinely innocent and sincere in it's convictions.  I see every ""flaw"" in the Phantom Menace as a smack of artistic license in the face of all those greedy studio executives.  Well that's my two cents on the matter anyhow, take them as you will because it's merely an opinion.  ""May the Force be with you... always.""",1
3722,10.0,"Well this movie proves two things.  That Lucas is the greatest movie creator of all time and that critics don't watch the movies they write articles about.  I've seen the movie 8 times in its first week and have to say that it was perfect.  I would have not started the saga out any differently. If you had problems with it go see it again (as well as the original trilogy), amazing.  The acting was flawless.  Many might ask What About Jar Jar?? Well Jar Jar was just fine he fit into the story perfectly and is a great first step for a character that will develop greatly over the next three, ask anyone who is not between 16 and 30 and they will most likely say that Jar Jar was one of their favorite characters.  Also I have never seen a movie cut like Phantom was.  I believe this is the reason most people are saying go see it twice before you rate it.  The movie moves so fast and jumps around so much in order to give you all that you can handle in two hours and 15 minutes that you literally have to see it twice just so it can all sink in.  Because of this Episode 1 has the best multi-viewing potential out of the saga.  If you haven't seen Episode 1 yet don't worry, it will be out in the theaters for at least another 6 months.  Let's see if it can break 1 billion domestically.  After this weekend it will be where titanic was two and a half months after it's release.  The attitude that pretty much sums up the movie would be ""are you braindead I'm not going in there with two jedi, send a driod"" or better yet ""Have you ever encountered a jedi night before......we will not survive this""",1
3723,10.0,"First of all, to everyone who has seen poor reviews of this movie, don't believe it.  Go see it for yourself.  I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, and I believe that the Phantom Menace lives up to the standard set by the first three.  While it is somewhat different,  it is still very familiar.  I enjoyed this movie very much, and was enthralled by it from beginning to end.  I am not going to go into the plot at all, but let me just say that I have already seen it four times, and plan to go again this weekend.  The story was great, the action sequences were amazing, and the lightsaber duel was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I think Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were amazing as Jedi Knights.  I cannot wait for Episode 2, to see where Mr. Lucas takes this story from here.  This one definitely lives up to the hype.",1

Overall, I would say that it was a great movie. The podrace was amazing and the light-sabre duels were incredible. I'd say the people at ILM and John Williams have outdone themselves again. I just hope George Lucas has the sense to PLEASE kill JarJar off early in Episode II...",1

Sure, It's story didn't compare to the original, but hey......That wasn't the point of this film! The Special FX in this film were unbelievable!!! The characters in this were awesome!! And the Jedi duel scene's were much better (Faster and more action). It had some other excellent scene's in it such as the podracing.

3728,3.0,"I think part of the problem with Phantom Menace was that there was far too much explication--not only of the backstory that leads to Episodes 4-6, but also of the characters. Instead of showing the emotions/sensations of fear, foreboding, exhilaration, and joy through the acting or choice of words, the movie told us that this or that was what the character was feeling. It's as though Lucas is completely at a loss when he has to show something that isn't renderable on a computer; as a result, all the characters--live action *and* 3D rendered--just come across as flat.",0

Also, it's the first live-action film with several computer-generated characters (Jar Jar Binks, Boss Nass, Watto), which previously had only been seen in animated movies (Toy Story, Antz, A Bug's Life). Definitely a milestone in film history!",1
3739,10.0,"An awesome movie.  I'm not sure why the critics collectively decided to ""dis"" it.  Perhaps they wanted a human interest story like Hans and the princess from episodes IV-VI.  Other than the love story, everything else I've come to expect of the star wars saga was there.",1

3742,7.0,Overall i feel this movie is worth seeing but it has some corny parts to it that make it not as good as the original.  There is the whole fact that you know Anakin skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi can't die takes away when they try to make it look like they could die.  Darth Maul was major kewl yet lucas only gave him a small part which wasn't cool at all.  The alien race that helps to protect Nabio were annoying since you could tell they were computer animated.  Then the whole fact that Anakin was able to fly the plane so well was corny also.  I would go see it in theatres but don't expect too much out of it,1

This movie does live up to the hype, but remember it is still a kids movie.  There are a bunch of little things that Lucas adds to this movie that stay in the tradition of the original movies.  Hands down the best movie of the decade.",1

I am certainly looking forward to episode II, to see what is in store for the heroes. Those who disliked this movie missed something.  We already know the ending (Jedi episode VI) and I think that they expected the whole thing be explained in one film.  This movie is a great stand alone story and a perfect beginning of the saga.",1

3748,10.0,"I personally liked ""Menace.""  I was able to see it the first day without waiting in a line overnight like a couple of friends I know.  I think the key for me was the fact I toned down my expectations of the film.  When I heard of the film's production nearly 2 years ago, I was excited, but I kept telling myself as the time grew nearer, ""I've waited this long, a couple more weeks wouldn't kill me.""  I will also go out on a limb and say that Jar Jar and the other Gungans didn't bother me in the least bit.  Everyone else I know to the exception of a few disliked them with a vengeance.  To the critics who have blasted the character development of characters like Obi-Wan, that character was already developed!!!  Don't forget that 22 years ago, Star Wars was big, but without the subsequent films that followed, the storyline was not all that great.  This is why these films are considered a saga.  The films are all tied together.  Space operas are that way by definition.  When Episodes 2 and 3 come out, I am willing to bet my life that those who waited in line for this one way too long and was disappointed will see that this is yet another look into George Lucas' genius writing abilities.  Besides, he can only fit so much into 2+ hours!",1
3749,,"The audience Lucas aimed this movie toward has no idea what they are supposed to be watching.  All they see is the unfortunate character Jar-Jar tripping over and falling off of anything Lucas can digitally create.  I found this movie dragging at points and cannot understand how both critics and audiences can applaud the all-too-predictable pod race scene.  Jake Lloyd was given too much dialogue for a boy who can't act and Ewan McGregor was tied down by an emotionless script that left him as nothing but a walking lightsaber.  Veteran actor Liam Neeson is the only shining star in this galaxy far, far away.  He alone provides the hero we like to see in a movie.  The villain of the story was the underachieving Darth Maul.  Lucas ought to be ashamed of himself for putting America's new ""Guy you love to hate"" in as many scenes as there were ""poop"" jokes.  Maul's cross-armed, ""tough guy"" stance and ""I'm so angry"" make-up is almost silly.  Using such a blindingly visual character the way he did, it's obvious Lucas failed to concede that we will never be as terrified as we were of the dark sound of James Earl Jones.  I won't go into the already popular racism debate but I leave with a humble plea to anyone Lucas asks opinions of when they read his next script: ""It's okay to tell him that it sucks.""",0

We discussed the movie after we left the cinema and I for once noticed my family loved Star Wars for a different reason.  The kids because of Jar Jar Binks,  my parents loved Queen Amidala and those darn spaceships that flew over our heads.  This is a family movie and I hope they(Lucas and Co.) keep it that way because it really is something to keep alive.",1

It is such a great pleasure watched the massive scenes that George Lucas (the genius) presents.  My favorite part of the Star Wars movies is the fact that high tech space machines are fighting in very low tech environment.  For example the forest in ROJ and the grass plains in The Phantom, and the snow scene in ESB.  I watch the movies for my movie-going pleasure.

Having seen the film whilst on holiday in Canada, the frustration from having to wait the six weeks before it is shown in England is almost unbearable especially as I want to tell everyone about it but have managed to contain myself thus far. The use of the up to date special effects is excellent as it is not too apparent whilst watching the film that special effects were used as you become totally engrossed in the story.

You could tell what was CGI and what wasn't but it looked so real that you didn't mind seeing it.  As for the plot, acting, etc. I think that critics of the movie don't understand that this is the FIRST part of a 3-part series!  You cannot give away everything in the first movie and Episode I did what it was supposed to do: establish the main characters like Anakin, Amidala, and Obi-Wan; and establish main plotlines that will be followed and explored in the next two films like Anakin's Jedi training, the Trade Federation's secret alliance with Senator Palpatine (the future Emperor), and the possible relationship between Amidala and Anakin.  I had extremely high expectations for this film and I can say that I was very pleased with the film.  While not necessarily the best of the Star Wars films it still was fantastic.

The plot, character generation, and script did not strike me as very intriguing or magical... the way I admired those of the first trilogy. However, the second and third time I saw the movie, I began to truly appreciate the movie. It really is a movie that is worth seeing more than once... there is so much more to appreciate and enjoy. The music seems to fit the scenes much better (the song Duel of the Fates is absolutely terrible to listen to by itself... but it fits the lightsaber battles quite well), and the characters begin to feel more 'alive.'

I avoided the spoilers as much as possible, and therefore some of the movie's surprises were kept pristine for me.  What I saw, however, disappointed me.  If I had never before seen a SW movie, this film would be an instant classic.  I think that George Lucas tried to push too much information into the film.  Most of the scenes without action feel forced and rushed.  It becomes far too easy for the casual viewer to ignore the plot and focus on the eye candy.  We really don't get much of a feel for the characters, which is a pity.  Some of them could have been truly fascinating.  As for the Jar Jar Binks controversy, I think that he is evidence that the series has wandered too far into being a kids movie. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but with TPM, it seems to force the plot even further into the background.  However, don't think this is a bad film.  For a SW fan, it's a terrific film filled with surprises for the discerning viewer.  For the casual viewer, it is a spectacle filled with some of the best visual effects *EVER*.  And, I might add, the lightsaber duels are fantastic.  The final one is perhaps the best fight scene in film history. Overall, I enjoyed TPM, and hope that with so much info crammed into Episode I, Episodes 2 and 3 will be able to expand the characters and story to do justice to the classic trilogy.",1

3772,3.0,"Having enjoyed the first 3 films, I was deeply disappointed by the Phantom Menace. To me, it appeared as a Kid's TV spin-off from the orginal Star Wars films. Alternatively, a 2 hour intro to a PlayStation game. It was basically an animated film, and in that respect, I felt it looked less visually impressive than certainly episodes V/VI. CGI can be an effective tool, but must be used sparingly. James Camerom recognised this with Titanic by using real models, as large as possible, to create a degree of realism. Like PM, those parts of Titanic that fail are the brief sections that use straight CGI. The mind is not fooled; instead, the mind thinks it is seeing a painting (which it is). The sense of depth and chaos expressed by the fight scene in Return of the Jedi easily outweighed the pastel Fx of PM. But Fx are just one aspect. The story was p.poor. Hardly the start of a Saga. Why can't George L escape American Apple Pie? Why does Anakin have to be a cute kid? Why couldn't he be a little s*d who shows signs of being bad? I have read that the British actors involved in the film were most disconcerted during the acting phase, since most of the time they were stuck in front of a blue screen. I love film music and by and large John Williams turns out a good score - occasionaly pappy if in the hands of a Spielberg film - but usually quite bold and striking. The score here, which seemed to be mainly choral work, was very lack-lustre. The highlight for me was spotting Ralph Brown (alias Danny the drug-dealer from Withnail & I) as the space-craft pilot. What this film needed was an adult them and the darkness of ESB injected into it. Why couldn't it have been nasty? The underlying story of the Empire is nasty, so why not portray that. I now no longer care a hoots about II and III. They can come and go as far as I am concerned. Is it me, or are people starting to bore of CGI. I watched Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan"" 2 days later, and for me, that film was infinitely better than Star Wars. George Lucas: grow up, look around the American Pie country you live in and realise that it's not all suburbia and zit-free. We can handle something nasty. Drop the pastel shades and give us something earthy and gritty. Alternatively, hand II and III over to someone like Tim Burton who may be able to salvage something from the disaster of Episode I.",0
3773,8.0,"""The phantom Menace"" has most of the things a movie should contain. A brilliant story, the best visual effects ever...ever, and a very evil bad-guy in Darth Maul. The reason I gave the film 8 and not 10, is because of my expectations. I thought it would be the thrill of a life time, and it only became the thrill of the month. In reality, it's probably better than most films, but it didn't reach up to what I thought I was getting.",1
3774,,"After watching the Star Wars TFM I left the theatre with the feeling that something was wrong.  I grew up with Star Wars like most people my age, and enjoy the old movies.  I liked the action and the cinematography but I am disturbed by some of the characters. First let us look at Jar-Jar and all his underwater friends.  Little Black Sambo stories and early Disney portrayals of dimwitted clumsy Native Americans have been frowned on for years.  It seemed to me like the film blended the two- with a tribe of people that have a difficulty with English and have not mastered the technologies that other people have.  The script did call for a isolationist tribe of people, but they did not have to be portrayed as clumsy and of a lesser intelligence.  Someone may bring up the point that in the end they worked together to ""save to day,"" but our underwater friends were used as cannon fodder for the trade robots while the cleaver white humans escaped injury during their sneek attack into the palace. Speaking of the trade interest, I wondered if their accents could sound more Asian.  They should been wrapped in U.S. flags and wearing cowboy hats with southern accents.  That would have been funny. I think of early Star Wars and Star Trek, and these movies are absent of alien characters with accents resembling those found on our planet.  Sure, the parallel between the Klingons and Russians has been drawn, but the Klingons do not speak with Russian accents and drink Vodka. I think it would have been fairly easy to have the same plot and characters without the problems I have briefly discussed above.",0
3775,,"I like star wars and none of my friends really do. But when i saw the movie i thought it was awesome. The sound effects were great,so were the graphics and special effects. I wasn't really into star wars until the movie, i just liked them now i can't wait until the next one comes out. I especially like JAR-JAR-BINKS. i think he is sooo adorable i love the way he talks but no one seems to agree with me.

3776,,"An over-all great movie that was over-hyped to the point of disgust,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, was just a sequel. In 1977 a movie came out that revolutionized not only the sci-fi genre of movies but the entire film industry. It contained unforeseen special effects, an unknown, new writer, political allusions, mythical outlines, intense religious themes, and all came back to the simplistic nature of the family. Now don't get me wrong, this movie was great. It was one of the best movies I've seen. But I believe that another movie deserves much, much more praise than The Phantom Menace and that movie is The Matrix. IT had revolutionary special effects, IT had an original plot, if that movie was hyped up HALF as much as The Phantom Menace It would have gathered mile lines also. But back to the movie at hand.

Now it is 22 years later and with children of my own, who have seen the original trilogy on video, I get to take them to see TPM.  This is a true treat! Let me say this, Mr. Lucas, you have done a wonderful job with your vision. Do not let these naysayers cast any doubt on your abilities or vision, you've done a splendid job.  You and Mr. Spielberg have the innate ability to touch upon what movies are supposed to be about, pure entertainment, plain and simple.  A movie is supposed to just let you get away and enjoy yourself and not dissect and critisize every little nuance of story, character and effects.  If you want to do that, go see documentaries.  You have created a wondrous fantasy that we can all just sit back and enjoy.  Kudos to you!  As far as 'what's in it for adults'?, I say to them, stop trying to see it through the eyes of an adult, it's not for you anyway, this film is for the inner child in us that most people seem to have lost.  People get a grip!  Sit back and enjoy the experience!  It's just a great way to while away a couple of hours.  The expectations of an adult are way too high!  We could tear apart every movie ever made and this one is just not appropriate to do that.  I look forward to the next episode with the same enthusiasm as TPM",1

3782,6.0,"A lot has changed since the first Star Wars movies.  The technical aspects of film making have advanced at light speed.  The Phantom Menace is loaded with great special effects - so what?  My kids have video game systems that provide more entertainment than this movie.  Ultimately it appears to me that this is the point of this entire enterprise.  The pod race, the battle sequence and the fight sequence with Darth Maul were obviously designed with the video game market in mind, not to mention action figures and fast food garbage.  These were not considerations when Lucas made the original Star Wars.  The original movie did not take itself seriously.  A group of unknown actors ( with the exception of Alec Guinness ) had a lot of fun making a western movie set in outer space and the audience loved it.  This new movie is an attempt by a bunch of Hollywood pros to recapture this spirit and make megabucks in the process.   They failed at the former but will succeed at the latter - afterall McDonald's has sold billions of 'hamburgers' by convincing millions of people that there really is some meat in there.",0
3783,,"The Phantom Menace has been called the most anticipated movie ever by many and it doesn't disappoint. Although it was battered by critics before it opened I felt that there was something missing from it. Well where should I begin,  I think there should have been a dialogue between Maul and the two Jedi's before or during their fight although their lightsabre fight was amazing. The alien creatures should have spoken not english but Lucas should have created an alien language like he did so many times in the three original films. For the viceroy and the gungans.  And the other one is that he shoulnd't have made everything computer generated, he should have given us more realistic things like ships e.t.c.  Overall the movie was excellent and I can't wait for Episode Two for the earlier rumors I have heard it has a better conflict and the clone wars are coming so I'm looking foward for Episode 2 coming in May of 2002.",1

3787,2.0,"Juvenile, clumsy, self-referential, self-congratulatory, overly sentimental, heavy handed, and completely lacking in mystery, majesty, and romance...Unfortunately these words apply to George Lucas' latest installment of the Star Wars series, The Phantom Menace.  There is little menace: the most threatening character, Darth Maul, appears in very little of the movie and only at predictable moments and threatens only the two Jedi at the center of this story--if one can call it that.  Since one of the Jedi is Obi-Wan, we know harm will come to him, leaving only the question of when the other Jedi, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, will meet his end.  There is no phantom (even if you are incapable of recognizing the thinly disguised voice of the future evil Emperor and have forgotten the story line of the first three Star Wars installments) because director/writer Lucas all but tells you who the Phantom Menace is in the penultimate scene with a contrived discussion of the pair-wise nature of evil Siths and a finger-pointing close-up.",0

All the acting was flat, apart from the mother who was probably the best of the lot, but to be fair they didn't have much to go on with... 4). No independent plot on which you would expect to form the movie. Overall: not too bad - eagerly awaiting the next ones!!",1

This movie was one great movie.  I can't understand why the acting was criticized.  It was the best ensemble I've seen in such a long time. Casting seven/eight year old Jake Lloyd was simply brilliance on the casting directors part.  He conveyed ""the chosen one"" very well and sent little chills up my spine knowing that he would soon, in later episodes, turn into Darth Vader.  Ewan McGregor was great and so was Natalie Portman.  Her as Queen Amidala was wonderful.  So was Jar Jar Binks.  For those of you who walked out before the credits ended, you missed out on something wonderful. After the last scene of credits rolled, before the fade out you can hear Darth Vader breathing.  What a wonderful way to end it!!!",1

3794,,"When I first saw the original Star Wars upon its release in 1977, I marveled at its broad appeal and its use of themes and narratives from classical mythology. The second installment, The Empire Strikes Back, was even more impressive with its dark intensity, its screwball-inspired romance, and its shocking plot twists. The third episode was less satisfying, but still had something in it for everyone. The one thing that bothered me, though, was the apparent ease with which we were supposed to accept the redemption of Darth Vader, aka Anakin Skywalker, whose murderous exploits had dominated the first two films.",1

And Natalie Portman was great! The Queen ROCKS!! She kicks all other characters in the BUTT!!!! GO SEE STAR WARS: PHANTOM MENACE.... ""i am not worthy!""",1
3797,,"This is disappointing tripe.  The script clunks, the characters plod, and the medicloreans need medichlorinating.  The special effects were grand, the fighting brilliant and the score wondrous, but:  the comic relief was ill-conceived and offensive, the accents of aliens seemed almost bigoted (the greedy trade federation have Japanese accents, the slave-driving underworld figure has an Italian accent, and the planetary underclass speaks West-Indian Pidgin English), and the ""emotional"" scenes (Anakin says goodbye, the Naboo appeal to the Jungians for help) lacked all human substance.  Plus, the Christian mythology takes over the core of the plot. Lucas's story is less something we can all relate to now and more something the young children of Christian parents can relate to.  Also, if Lucas didn't need a character as dumbed down as Jar Jar to appeal to children the first three times out, what in the world does he need one for now? Overall not bad, but overwhelmingly not in the class of the first three.",0
3798,,"Let me first start off by saying that I'm a huge Star Wars fan....but I'll admit if they had put out a trash movie, Star Wars or not, I would be the first to admit it sucked.  If you're a fan of the series, don't believe the critics who say it has no place with the ""Star Wars"" titled slapped on, or the people who say something to the effect of ""...The best Star Wars yet!"" The best, it is not, but I don't think it's the worst, either.  I'd rate it third, behind Empire and A New Hope, and ahead of Jedi.  I'm not the type of person who sees enough movies to understand the plot entirely during the first viewing, so I saw it a second time two days ago, after seeing the first showing (May 19th, 12:01 AM).  I was much more impressed the second time, as I picked up on the plot much better.  With a movie the magnitude of the Phantom Menace, I think people have a tendency to get too caught up in the visuals and don't necessarily ""get"" the plot the first time around....but after the second time, I'm much more impressed with the movie....as a Star Wars movie.  It's been said before, but I think this movie sets up episodes II and III beautifully....it's definitely not a movie that could've stood alone, like say, A New Hope. Flawed?  Yes, but I wasn't looking for the ""perfect movie."" Ignore the hype either way.  I liked it for what it was....a Star Wars movie, not something that focuses on stellar acting performances, or a classic story.

3804,7.0,"Ok. So the movie is astounding as a visual experience. We all know that. We also know that the acting is not the most important feature on this flick. As a member of the audience I felt like trying to erase what I have seen in the star wars trilogy but some how the images and charm of those movies simply could not match here. Something is missing. Obviously its a new beginning but is more than that what bothers me. Its that the characters are not spherical in any scense. Darth Maul for starters. he is amazing, but I could not believe that he went as fast as he came. Ewan's Character is very close to the Idea that i had about Obi Wan in his youth, maybe it will all be compensated in the next two films for him. Anakin's lines are so superficial that makes a terrible mistake: the connection with our galaxy, a thing that did not happen in the other movies. I think that George Lucas was so concentrated in his digital domain of visual shock that he did not pay attention to the acting. Somehow the movie's best moments are those involving less acting and more action, like the pod race and the gungan war againts the battle droids. Now, thats very impresive enough. Yes, but why as a fan I feel...not as happy?. From the fan point of view I can forgive star wars' Darth Vader so insecure and lacking of the real darkness he represents in Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, and so I will forgive the ""duh"" personality young anakin has, and that Jar Jar Binks does not make me laugh, on the contrary he will not be as memorable as Chewbacca or the ewoks them selves. I figured out that this movie was not made for my age, nor for my expectations. But I enjoyed watching it, remembering when I was 9 years old and saw Star Wars for the first time. It wasn't 1977.",1

3808,7.0,"The most anticipated movie of all times is about the origin of Anakin Skywalker, who will later become Darth Vader, and how will the ""Empire"" become the oppressor of the Galaxy in the follow up movies (Star Wars: episodes IV, V and VI). We also get to see how some of the characters (as C3-PO and R2-D2)get involved in the saga. The movie is played by Liam Neesan in the role of Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as Obi wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman(Queen Amidala/Padme) and Jake Lloyd(Anakin Skywalker). The movie is fun to watch but lacks of that charismatic spark, between the characters, that made Star Wars a movie franchise. The main problem is that the story is lead by the character of Qui Gon Jinn, whose ""too calmed"" attitude makes him boring in most of the scenes, to the point that makes you wonder if Neesan wanted to appear in the movie in the first place. Even his relationship with Obi-Wan, is that of a Batman with a Robin that never seems to get things right. There aren´t really enough scenes in which the characters interact with each other, to get to know them enough to finally make an impression in you. The clearest example of this is Darth Maul (Ray Park), whose character you don´t even remember that was in the film after you watched it. Important scenes between Anakin and Padme are suddenly cut before you get to realize the importance of the characters in the saga. So in the end all the characters, as Obi Wan puts it in the movie, are ""another pathetic life form"" that joins in the journey. Also the peculiar way of speaking of Jar Jar Binks(Ahmed Best), makes it difficult to understand what he is saying to the point that you don´t care what his lines are about. And finally, the conclusion of the movie doesn´t seem as important as the race that takes place in the middle of it. Even, as a fan, I think that there are better books in the Star Wars cult saga than this movie. And speaking of being a fan, I think that there are some scenes that doesn´t make sense with the follow up movies. In other words, the characters lack of that charm between them that makes them look like a team and the story plot doesn´t seem to have as many work as the surroundings in the movie, which are in the end, the most relevant thing of the film.

When Obi-Wan buys the farm in A New Hope, and Yoda becomes stronger than you can ever imagine in Return of the Jedi, there is a sense of rhythm there.

The Hitlerian overtones surrounding the ascension of Palpatine, life and death struggle over galactic trade routes (with Palpatine taking advantage of this behind the scenes), and the rise of an ancient, supposedly extinct enemy: this is heady stuff, well beyond the Independence Day/5th Dimension kind of junk I've seen it compared to.

As the title to the film began to scroll I felt like a 7 year old again watching the original Star Wars movie.  The special effects in the movie are absolutely seamless, they integrate into the film without really being noticed which is what Lucas and his magicians would hope to achieve.  A lot of criticism has been leveled at too much use of special effects, but if that's what is required to tell a story - I think it should be used.  The main thread of the story is simple but it is entwined with other small stories which I think will become more apparent in the next two prequels, having said that - I think only the die hard Star Wars fans will pick up on some of hints in the smaller stories. The actors all played excellent parts - especially Jake Lloyd who gave a wonderful performance as the 'Young Anakin Skywalker'. All in all - you have to remember that these films are basically fairytales aimed at children but even the adults just can't help getting caught up in it all.  To finalise - ignore the critics (this is STAR WARS), bring on the next two.",1
3826,8.0,"I liked the movie very much. He's great, definitely StarWars, with good battles, action scenes and the slower parts where you meet the characters. But I think George wanted to put too much information and sequences in the first half of the film. They follow each other very fast and so it seems a bit chaotic. Kinda like, I have to tell them this but I don't exactly have the time to do it properly. Like the Gungan sub breakdown, it could have been a little bit longer like the Falcon stop inside the astroid. But once the movie reaches Tatooine he's fabulous. I like the ending very very much (the bad guy is very impressive) !! Good job George !!!",1
3827,10.0,"Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is one of the most thrilling, exhilarating cinematic experiences I've had the pleasure to take part in. Like its legendary Star Wars predecessors, The Phantom Menace is fantastic, well crafted entertainment that appeals to audience members of all ages. It's creativity and imagination outshine anything done in the films of recent years.  There is much to like about the film, the superior art direction, elaborate costumes, the complex sets, the superior visual effects, the rousing musical score, and so on.  The complex, multi-layered plot is both interesting and thought provoking, telling a series of stories tied together well with the central plot.",1

While watching the film one cannot help but being blown away by the special effects which created well... how such I put it... interesting characters such as Jar Jar Binks. It also created realistic scenery like that of the almost too lifelike planet of Naboo or Coruscant. One is immediately attracted to the likes of Queen Amidala, whose devotion to her people was very commendable.

The latest movie is a departure from the previous three being that it is geared more to the younger crowd. I saw this movie the first time with my wife and I enjoyed it. I saw it the second time with my children and I loved it right along with them.  I have taken my kids a third time and I enjoyed it more than ever.  This movie has really encouraged my kids to get excited about science and engineering. Both are trying to figure out how they can construct their own Pod Racer. There are many movies that can have a negative impact upon our children; this one has had a profound positive impact.  Although the critics may not have liked it, the effect upon my children confirms that this will become another all-time classic.",1

And all that action figure stuff that has invaded the stores. I am aware of that precisely because of my genuine interest in getting deeper into the SW saga. I needed to know somethong about the Empire of about the Republic, but definitely not about midiclorians (what a sort of scientific trash and/or of a spoiler of the mystic qualities of the force!) Less Jarjar Binks, more Darth Maul, less Anakin (what a parodie of a hero) more QuiGon,more ObiWan, more Amidala, less R2 and 3PO.Boy, George, you are definitely spoiling all of the story with those ludicrous links. Where in the name of the Force is the story? Cause it is just a group of sequences, a groupof exhibitions of all the merchandising stuff. Probably made for kids,could be,but wasnt that the case with the original trilogy? Then, we could infere that 99s kids are more alienated and less wise or sharpminded than 77s!! Is it that?Please tell me!",0
3847,5.0,"I really was looking forward to Star Wars episode I, but I was really disappointed when I finally saw the movie. I found the characters to be much too naive and the plot kind of ... ""no frills"" type, easily predictable. I suppose that if I was 12 years old, the movie would have blown my socks off, the same way Star Wars IV, V and VI did a couple of years ago. Of course everything in this world is about money, but deep inside I kept on hoping that George Lucas would make a movie for adults and not for kids, a movie for the guys who saw the other episodes but had since then grown up and were expecting something much less ""fairy-tale""...

3849,,"Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace was an incredibly pleasing  movie, allowing me to understand how a relationship came about between the parents of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. The film also had that undercurrent of unease about Anakin Skywalker, displayed prominently when the Jedi Committee tested the boy and Yoda found the feeling of fear in him and explained how such a feeling would lead to his role in the Dark Side. One who saw Episode I but not the first three could even have a bad feeling about where Skywalker was headed, where his destiny would take him, whether or not they had heard through others that the storyline was on a young Darth Vader. Also, the saber duel- or shall I say trio? triel?- between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul, was much more active and convincing than the ""hokey"" saber duels between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker in the first three installments.",1

I must say that at a shallow level the film is enjoyable, but if you take a moment to remember that you are not seven anymore, the sinking feeling of disappointment is palpable.",0

I am a big SW fan and I have watched the film as one. And I have to say: THE MOVIE IS NOT AS BAD AS I IMAGINED! Probably because I expected it to be the worst movie I had ever seen. Sure, it is very fast, almost too fast. I would have liked to have some opportunities to just sit back and deal with the information George gave us. Also, the plot is very thin and the characters lack depth. I wonder why George Lucas did not use the fabulous actors he got for Episode I. Neeson and McGregor are really excellent actors, so why not use their talents???",0
3853,,"Could this movie have been more horrible?  Has George Lucas forgotten what it takes to make a good MOVIE?  Forget all the effects, that's mere window dressing.  Develop some characters, get rid of Jar-Jar, and focus on some grown-up dialog.  The acting is so horrible in this movie, from little Darth, all the way up to Ewan McGregor, who is a fine actor.  That should tell you something about the directing.  It's so disappointing that so much time and effort was spent on the digital graphics at the expense of everything else.  If this was any other movie, people would not be so afraid to criticize it.  Believe me, I wanted this movie to be good as much if not more than anyone else.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Lucas is so concerned about non-violence and making this movie for the kids, that he totally alienated the generation that made this series the classic that it's become. The war between the Gungans and the droid army was an absolute sham. Without giving away too much, the climax was a one of the more unoriginal, unimaginative endings I've ever seen.  I could go on forever with the disappointments of this film, it's really that horrible.",0
3854,10.0,"The emotion viewing The Phantom Menace is different from SW IV-VI. The whole movie is held in light colors - no gray (nazi?) uniforms as the imperium will use them. No Darth Vader - no swamp - even Mos Eisley and the pod-race give a impression of the good old days of the republic. This tension is missing in SW I but Lucas is right at not showing it. I hope SW II and III will turn to the emotion of the rebellion, the presence of fear, weakness and disillusion. Knowing about Palpatins faith SW I gives only glances of the beginning conflict. Stunning is the design - invented in 1977 the Phantom Menace can follow this line of costumes and architecture - it is the same ""universe"". More special effects and aliens only enriches the universe - the SW-Fan feels at home. The actors in The Phantom Menace could not show their talents until now. Only Natalie Portman was able impress as Queen Amidala. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia seems like a teenaged schoolgirl (in SW IV) after Natalie Portman rescues her home planet Naboo. The other acting possibilities in SW I are taken by the Lucas Team of ILM - aliens in action...",1

None of the characters were three-dimensional. It was cardboard characters from start to finish. Good guys and bad guys. It made no difference.",0

Both visuals and sound are stunning and you'll get two hours of non-stop fun and action. If you're a fanatic fan, maybe you'll be disappointed by the massive share of comic stuff you'll get and the somewhat missing true Star Wars atmosphere, but if you regard it as being just a movie and nothing more, you will face a solid piece of entertainment. I'd rate E1 8/10 points (E4: 9  E5: 8  E6: 8). By the way, it's the first movie ever where - in my insignificant opinion - the German dubbed version beats the original.",1

THIS IS STAR WARS. yes a kids flick. and if you go  in ready to tear up this movie then you will find a reason. but if you go in like i did like when i was 6 then you might actually enjoy it. regardless to many reviews i feel that Ewan Mcgregor gave a very good performace. considering what little footage of Alec Guiness as obi-wan he had to study. I felt that it represented the original trilogy very well.

Many people told me that they didn't like the movie that much because there wasn't much action.

I was once Lucas' largest fan, now I regret ever supporting him.",0
3885,10.0,"For everyone who has been panning this movie, this is just a few words on the subject. 1.  This is not the full picture of what George Lucas intends to show us, and as Star Wars fans we should realize this going into the movie.  With Star Wars in 1977, Lucas set up a vision that anything subsequent would follow.  This led to what I feel is the most brilliant chapter in the epic, ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  By watching the original movie again you can see that in the back of Lucas's mind he knew where the saga would go if he was able to continue it.  Just watch the scenes where Obi-Wan is explaining Anakin to Luke, the expressions on Sir Alec Guiness' face are priceless. To me this shows the genius of G. Lucas. 2.  It is a movie, whose basic premise is 'symbiotic relationships,' in other words good and evil, the Naboo and the Gungans and master and student. It shows the way that one relates and must get along with the other in order to survive. 3.  If this strikes you as too kid-friendly, just pause a moment and consider what is to come with Episode II & III: the Jedi purge, the conversion of Anakin to the Dark Side and Chancelor Palpatine's ascension to ultimate power in the universe.  This is going to be some dark stuff and will not end on a happy note, like the end of ""Return of the Jedi.""  This was pretty much Lucas' only chance at a happy ending in this continuation of the saga. 4.  I got hooked on these movies when I was a child, and my fascination carried over to my adulthood.  Originally, around the time of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" Lucas stated that there would be 9 Episodes to the saga(3 trilogies in all), after the original trilogy, he took a 15 year hiatus from them and now here we are.  Personally, I am just glad to have him making these vital movies again. 5.  To address all the negative criticisms I have read about the film, here I go.  No, the Trade Federation is not a replacement of the Empire, they are merely puppets of the Sith.  Just think of them as the inept Empirial officers of the original trilogy, like Admiral Ozzel, who carried out the orders of Vader.  Next, Jar-Jar is not that bad(he is a bit annoying), but he fits into the mythology of the series by providing comic relief and bringing the Gungans and the Naboo together, so they may overcome the Dark forces in the universe.  So forth, the various reports of stereotyping of racial groups in this film are far-fetched.  The dialects and speaking manners of characters that do not exist has to come from somewhere, and I believe Lucas went to pains to try and include other cultural habits in this film, more than any other, in an attempt to flatter, not to hurt anyone. It felt as if he was attempting to step beyond all the white people, who were in Star Wars to include the other races of this planet.  Also, the main race if any that I feel would be most offended by any of the movies, would be the British from the original trilogy. 6.  Now just one gripe.  A few years ago, I went to see a little film called ""Braveheart,"" and was blown away by the battle scenes.  Now it seems that everyone in Hollywood feels a need to restage their own version of these scenes, and I am ashamed to say that it appears that Lucas fell into that category in ""Episode I.""  The final battle scenes between the Gungans and the Trade Federation Battle Droids, although they blow you away with special effects, they seem to me to lack in the originality department. All in all though, this is a great beginning for the Star Wars saga, and it will keep me coming back as the original trilogy.",1
3886,10.0,"in my opinion Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is one of the best movies ever. It's just like a big dream, a tale of great adventure, of hope, trust and friendship. If you really really love the other Star Wars Movies (A new Hope, The Empire strikes back, Return of the Jedi), you will see the first few seconds of Phantom Menace and you will think 'I'm back at home'. This film is Star Wars and you can feel it every second. Watching this movie really helps you forgetting your sorrows and problems of everyday-life for about 2 hours. It really worths the time and money you have to spend to watch the movie. Even if you don't like the 'old' Star Wars films, maybe the new one will open your eyes and you will be able to see all the magic of this mystical old galaxy, its honorful heros, its wise leaders and its proud warriors. So, enjoy The Phantom Menace and MAY THE FORCE ALWAYS BE WITH YOU !!! Möge die Macht mit Euch sein !!!",1
3887,,"This movie was a joke.  Lucas is definitely a fine movie stylist, but he cannot write a script.  The acting was wooden, the computer effects overused, and the story was cannibalized from the first three movies.  I have seem more of a plot in Barney videos.  Don't waste your money on this film.",0
3888,,I think that putting jar jar blinks in the movie was a really good idea because I think he was funny.  I love the special effects of the movie. It has a good story line but I think that Terry Brooks told it better.  I love the pod race scene of the movie.  I think that George Lucas can make a great movie.  I can wait to see the next one.,1
3889,7.0,"First of all, I have to say that I am a big star wars fan and loved episodes 4, 5 and 6.  So naturally I was extremely excited about the prequels and was waiting impatiently for this movie months before it came out.  When it finally did, I went to go see it and came out with an empty feeling.  It was still Star Wars.  It had the Star Wars feel, it had the Star Wars characters but it did not have the same depth and meaning as the older Star Wars movies.  It felt like one long commercial promoting george lucas' technological capabilities and the countless number of Star Wars merchandise ready to be sold on the shelves of every store.  I gave this movie a 7 because it was fun to watch at times and set the stage for a potentially interesting episode 2.  For every Star Wars fan it's a must, but for those who have little interest in it, don't expect a great movie, just go in and watch a great exhibition of modern computer technology.",1
3890,4.0,"There are two kinds of people - those who love Jar Jar Binks and those who hate Satan Incarnate. Needless to say, I'm one of the latter. It is impossible to believe that anyone who wrote the first three movies could write this tripe. They went through all that trouble to paint Darth Maul's face intricately and promote him heavily in the trailer and then he spits out two lines and is dead. His last fight scene is the only thing worth watching.",0

For example, the connection between the sentence ""you have brought hope to those who have no hope"" by Shmi Skywalker and the title of Episode IV, ""A New Hope"". Try to think about that for a while!",1
3894,5.0,"O.K The most anticipated film ever was going to be hard to beat.

Still for Episode 2 a few changes",1
3895,,"I thought that The Phantom Menace was the best movie I have ever seen and recommend it to any Star Wars fan.  The acting was a lot better than the previous movies, even though I enjoyed them too, as was the choice of more well known actors/actress'.  Jake Lloyd was excellent in portraying the character of Anakin and seemed a lot older than he is.  Natalie Portman played the queen very well also, being able to switch from being a royal queen to a simple handmaiden very easily.  Liam Neeson played Qui-Gon Jinn so well while watching the Haunting recently could imagine him saying to Luke ""Luke drop"" or pulling out his lightsaber.  Jar Jar Binks while thought by others as annoying was pretty funny especially when he got his tongue stuck in the energy binders.",1
3896,10.0,"Although the critics of TPM were awful, I believe that it is a great movie and defenetly one of the best of 1999. I admit that to fully enjoy the film you should have seen the old trilogy. Except that and the fact that Jar-Jar might have been a LITTLE annoying, the film was great. The FX ( both sound and visual) were the best I´ve seen yet in a movie, the acting was not great but good to say the least, the soundtrack was G-R-E-A-T (Probably the best soundtrack ever) and the Lightsaber duel at the end was the best of all the films. Basically, the only lack of The Phantom Menace was the unique, the one-and-only, the true star of Star Wars, Darth Vader. B.t.w. Palpatine IS Sidius",1
3897,10.0,This movie was nailed by critics before they'd even seen it. I don't know what it was but they just seemed to have it in for this brilliant movie from the beginning. They payed out the remarkably brilliant story line and Jake Lloyd's unreal acting. The truth of the matter is this movie has been and always will be remembered as yet another amazing part of the 2nd greatest story even told.,1
3898,7.0,"Never before had I seen a film, where the audience (at least 20% of them) dressed up as the characters.  Nor had I heard a reaction quite like the roars that traveled through the aisles upon the title sequence.  Surely, this would be something special.",1
3899,10.0,"The highest praise I can give this movie is that I rate it alongside the original trilogy.  It was with some trepidation that I entered the cinema, having heard how awful the film was from many ""learned"" sources.  However, criticism was rather harsh to say the least.  Jar Jar was mildly irritating yes, some dialogue was stilted and there could have been more emotional resonance at the film's climax.",0
3900,10.0,"I have seen this film in cinema at least 7 times. This is my favorite Star-Wars-film of all 4 films. The story is great and the special effects are fantastic.

3902,7.0,"A lot of reviewers really gave this movie a good reeming.  In my opinion, most of them went in expecting the ultimate prequel to the original three, and were let down.  If you just go in and expect a good summer movie, you'll be pleased.",1
3903,4.0,"Well,I travelled to New York to see this movie.New York was great but the movie was only good! Episode1 is nothing against the original Star Wars from 1977. A Star Wars movie without Harrison Ford is like Germany without beer!!! I hope episode 2 will be better!",1
3904,10.0,"I have read many comments about the nature of the screenplay and the high-tech special effects, but seldom do I read that the Phantom Menace is a wonderful and pure fantasy experience. I have been a fan of the Star Wars saga since first viewing episode 4 in theaters and have found myself, on occasion, completely immersed in the lore and mythology of this universe. The Phantom Menace proved to me that there is so much more to the Star Wars world than that which we have all read, and dreamed about in the past. This exploration into the lives of individuals on, until now, unheard of planets was completely in keeping with the tradition of Star Wars thus far. Everything is new to us and therefore should not be judged as critically as the direction that the reviews often seem to take. Could it be that other planets have advanced technically more quickly than those in the previous episodes? Could some catastrophic event have occurred in the universe (eg. the Clone Wars) that could have wiped out many technological advances from the galaxy? This is the beauty of Star Wars. It took place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, and none of us could possibly know how its history and technology could change life from one episode to the other. So please remember, when watching this new world unfold before your eyes, that it is a world unlike our own, supporting flora and fauna, human and alien, and a technical knowledge that we can't help but to believe is possible. I recommend that all Star Wars fans take a trip to see the Phantom Menace.",1
3905,3.0,"Having seen the original three in their first release I was disappointed by Phantom Menace.   The graphics and special effects were stunning, but the plot was very thin and transparent.   Darth Sidious was a sad waste of a great looking bad guy.   Not a patch on the menace and style of Darth Vader!",0
3906,,"To all of you who complain how Lucas lost his magic when he did ""Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace,"" let me just say this one thing: get a grip. Okay, so Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character in moviedom.  That's the only bad thing about it.  I believe that with what Lucas had to work with, he did wonders with it.",0

3908,,"As I stood in the queue, I was very excited what will be waiting for us and after the movie I could not hold back my tears. What I loved was killed by its maker. The religion of the Force was no longer a religion, it depended on small pieces of ""Force""...That was not happening. And the Special FX were hyped for nothing. O.K., I have to admit, the podrace was quite well made.",1
3909,,"This film features all of the flaws and crassness of Return of the Jedi, minus any goodwill toward the series you may have had back in 1984.   This is a two hour commercial for Lucas, his products and his Industrial Light and Magic company. Essentially a film without focus, plot, or any emotional impact, it contains one big letdown after another, stripping the series of its original magic and mystery.  The real force behind this turkey is not micro-organisms, but the almighty dollar.  Peyew!",1
3910,,"Episode I is very different from the current trend in science fiction films or action films in general, it doesn't know anything about the 90's lifestyle, MTV, it doesn't use any pictures of decay (which became trendy perhaps after 'se7en' or the Prodigy videos) as a stylistic element ('The Matrix' is located much more on that side of the spectrum), which a lot of current action movies do.",1
3911,,"To all you shallow people out there who have said that this movie had no plot, go take a long walk on a short pier. This movie isnt really intended to be a movie on its own. It is a foreshadowing of things to come. The blockade of Naboo was just a setup. Jinn said that the Trade Federation stood to gain nothing from the blockade, and they didn't but Sidous did. Sidous/Palpatine wanted to get rid of Chancellor Vellorum by making the Senate seem to no longer function. Thereby Amidala got Vellorum thrown out and Palpatine elected as Supreme Chancellor. Thus Palpatine slowly begins to form his New Order, and being Chancellor helps this. The entire movie is a prelude to the other 5 movies. This is a movie for Hardcore Star Wars fans to understand.",0
3912,,"Where do I start?  Jar Jar Binks must die and be forever stricken from Star Wars memory.  Anakin built CP3O?!?!? What?!!? Oh, that's believable. Darth Maul was cool, too bad he only spoke like twice.  How do you make such a great bad dude and then just kill him off at the end?  We never even get a chance to get ANY characters truly fleshed out.  Almost everything we know about all the characters we know because of the middle episodes.  Did Lucas write this in his sleep or something?  Good idea, but could have a better script and direction.  Don't even get me started on the cinematography.",0
3913,,"George Lucas has successfully revived,no, propagated a new genre of cinema. The Star Wars trilogy will never be forgotten among film lovers like Citizen Kane.  His romantic tales laced with mythological, Arthurian and otherwise, while not original, have sparked the imaginations of even the most dour viewers.  He did it right.  They were the ultimate stories of good vs. evil, good and evil having definite boundaries, no gray.  They had memorable characters. With this set against the sweeping landscape of space and other exotic planets, one could totally forgot the mediocre direction and just get immersed in the moment.  He truly created an experience.",0
3914,,"In order to see this film three times the first day it opened, i not only skipped my classes, but also the senior awards night my school put on. i was fortunate enough to get a scholarship that night, but as soon as i was informed it was the last award for me, i left the ceremony for the theater. For graduation, i even broke the school's rules of ""no decorations on caps and gowns"" and smuggled in my crimson mortarboard, upon which i copied darth maul's facial tattoos. Natalie Portman's image adorns my desktop wallpaper at least 95% of the time, and I have seen the film over a dozen times. But there's a reason behind being so hardcore, and that reason is this: Star Wars/Episode One/The Phantom Menace rocks hard. Very hard. So hard that for a while i couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. After watching it with increasing scrutiny, however, i feel i am now able to give a balanced review. Basically, you'll like this movie for a number of reasons. It is easy to at least appreciate its numerous production teams who worked their hardest to raise the standards of the special effects industry. In other words, see it for this fact alone. If you're a Star Wars fan, by definition you should love this movie.  Additionally, this movie contains some excellent acting talent, with such stars as Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Terrence Stamp, and the wonderful Natalie Portman. Although I can't say any of the actors were at their best in this movie, they did make it interesting and foreshadowed a more interesting Episode Two (Sam Jackson + lightsaber >worth my seven bucks) Lastly, from a film student's perspective, the movie was truly inspiring, because it is the perfect example of how far someone can take their dreams. The concept of Star Wars could not have been more of a success, and this movie greatly attests to that fact. On the ""bad"" side, if you're looking for a more serious film, this is not for you. Much of the dialogue is directed towards children, and i know this proved frustrating for a lot of other hardcore fans. Remember though, this is Lucas' world, and he wrote the screenplay. Additionally, the depth of the characters and situations is shallow. Few meaningful rites of passage occur between the characters, because--like many other S/F films and novels--the best way to progress is by coming out on top of a huge fight (i.e. the upcoming Battlefield Earth). Other low points are mainly just Lucas' excesses: Jake Lloyd's cheesy lines, action before dialogue, and the entire entity of Jar Jar (who's lovely to look at, but was it necessary to have him on so much? oh right--kid's movie; gotta remember that... ;), or the missed opportunities: a gifted cast whose potential was stifled, and the chance to expose more of the Jedi powers (what planet did that midichlorian explanation come from?). Remember what i said before, though! This truly is one of the best films of all time and i loved it tremendously. Since this movie had such an effect on me, i hope to be on board Episode Three as a 3d animator (heck, i'll even deliver the coffee, just SOMETHING!), since i should be out of effects school in time. Until then, may the force be with you!",1
3915,10.0,I loved the work that they did bringing the characters and worlds to life.I think the movie is very detailed with it's many scenes.In my opinion it was better than the old three.The whole movie looks better.I can't wait to see the next two editions when they come out.,1

Episode 1 had spectacular FX, however, people will be p***ed when they see that the next 3 movies look like crap.  Sure, the movie would cost a lot more without the FX, but it would retain its classic look.  Even more, this looked like a children's movie.  A 5-year-old would probably never understand Star Wars: A New Hope until he/she turns 6 or 7.",0
3919,3.0,"This has got to be the worst letdown in history. Yar yar Binks is, yes annoying and although I know that I'm not the first one to say so it has to be stated. Annakin is annoying, not as in bad actor or his dialog, but as in ridiculous actions. He could probably take care of the entire empire at the age of ten. And what I feel is the worst is that it feels like Mr. Lucas threw in some eyecandy/cool scenes like the racing scene and the fighting scenes and just shut his eyes as hard as he could regarding the fact that the rest of the movie sucked infernally. That is exactly what Star Wars did not use to be about. But I do have to add that Darth Maul is damn cool and Miss Portman is equally cute. Hope he shapes up when making part two and three.",0
3920,,Why are you all analyzing this movie. It is there for entertainment only. It is not there for critical acclaim or to show real life issues. It is not as though it is a movie like Schindler's List or American History X. It is a kid's movie! It is not there to be analyzed. It is for enjoyment. If you don't like it then T.S! George Lucas is laughing all the way to the bank. I would like to see all the people who hate this movie make one like this. All the special effects included plus the script and lets see if you can make a better one. I doubt you can. I think alot of people only went to see this movie so they could bag it. They saw something that was getting alot of attention and felt they had to spoil it. To whoever said that Jar Jar Binks is racist are you an idiot?! Who in their right mind would think that?! He is a fun character and has more of a sense of humour than you do! How can you not like a movie that is so fun and so pure. There are no other kids movies that are like Star Wars.

They were all magic moments, and I was hoping to maybe relive a bit of my childhood by seeing the new Star Wars movie. But being a slightly cynical adult now, I'm afraid to say the magic is gone. I'll say some good things first. The light sabers sounded the same. The spaceships all roared the same way I'd remembered. The special effects and production design were as amazing as expected. But those things aren't what made the original Star Wars films some of the greatest films of all time. It was the magic moments. Like Luke looking forlornly at the tatooine sunset; the moment he switched off his targeting computer and gave away to the force; Yoda raising the X-wing out of the swamp. And so on. Some great moments in film history.",1

I watched and continue to watch this movie enthralled as to what will develop next.  We know Anakin will become Vader, but how does it happen? What happened to the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin? These are questions that start to be answered in this first installment of the Star Wars Saga. I must say that in my opinion Ep. 1 fits in perfectly with the other movies. It is the introductory chapter of a larger story.    One day I will watch all the movies, 1 - 6, and marvel at the characters and the story that I've come to know and love.",1

We (at least most of us) knew that Chewbacca was really a man wearing a monkey suit, but at least he was real.",0

He is the one destroying the movie completely. OK he could be funny if you saw him in like one scene, but he is always ...argh... throughout the whole movie.. agh.. Still...

Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman, who can in fact act their way through a wet paper bag, do very well at not bringing more than they should to their roles. You catch just the hint of self-amusement in all of them, enough to make the movie that much more enjoyable. How the heck do you do a scene interacting with characters that will be drawn in later?

Finally, I found the virgin birth references to Annakin's conception rather absurd, if only because I think someone already snagged that particular trick. Lucas was probably aiming for the kid audience, but at he expense of the older group that are his most rabid supporters.

The pod race commentator comes out with present-day American-isms which do not suit the film whatsoever, Ewan McGregor's acting is so wooden he might as well be peddling Mr Sheen, and Jake Lloyd acts like he is  George Lucas' parrot.

So, o.k., I got to see the beginning of a great saga for about a third of the time, but the rest... The rest of the movie... JarJar... big fish, bigger fish, biggest fish, duh... pod racing, computer-animated robots, space ships, cities and planets... Toy Wars. I'm must give some credit to the computer-animated parts, for some of them where really good, i.e. It was sometimes very hard to tell the difference between computer-animated and reality.

It's when you take in the other two instalments of the trilogy that it all starts to get interesting. We learn more of the force; we get into Han's character and Leia's. We meet the evil emperor who has Vader on his leash, we learn that Vader is Lukes father. Seeing the same characters in the 3 movies allows them and the scenarios they're put in mean much more to us. Lando turned out to be a cool guy, he wasn't in Episode IV, we saw him at the end of Episode V and he turned out to be quite nasty, but in the end, wasn't he cool?",0

3949,,"There's little doubt that this movie did not meet the expectations of most fans. It clearly lacks the likeable, quirky characters of the original trilogy. It also lacks a villain that we can really enjoy hating. Yes, I know it's ""the phantom menace"". I genuinely enjoy the idea of Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious pulling the strings behind the scenes. However, a great opportunity was lost by making Darth Maul such a one-note villain. I remember fans (and myself) just gasping with awe when we first saw the trailer for the movie in the fall of '98. That tattooed face, and the double-bladed lightsaber! Such possibilities. Who knew that he'd have more lines in the ""tone poem"" commercial than in the entire film? What the original trilogy lacked in fight choreography, it made up for with dramatic intrigue. Luke being taunted and enticed to come over to the dark side, minus one hand. Vader threatening to corrupt Leia....In ""Phantom Menace"", wonderful fight choreography, but no drama to connect the characters to each other. Why wouldn't Qui-Gonn ask Maul about who he is or what he wants?",0
3950,,"I was very excited about this movie coming out.  For years, I have talked with many friends about the story before Star Wars (episode 4).  I liked what the movie presented; setting up the rise of the empire and the start of the rebellion. However, what I found weak was in the use of computer graphics in creating certain characters i.e. Jar Jar Bings.  I think the movie lost a lot by not using the costumes used on the previous films. Chewbacca would have looked silly if it was a computer graphic.  The first trilogy, I believe, was made much more real by introducing characters played by people in suits or make up portraying weird aliens.  I think that also helped the script by making it more dependable on a good story.  My hope is that the next few films would take that into consideration and reduce the amount of computer graphics use to create characters.  By using costumes and make up it may bring the ""operatic"" feeling the first trilogy had.",0

With only a handful of ""actual"" actors in the movie, we might as well been watching a Disney flick (no offense Walt).  I am aware that this has been said a billion times, but what was Lucas thinking with Jar Jar Blinks?!? Jar Jar was the worst example of comic relief I've ever seen!  Was some six year old controlling Lucas?  The worst part about this is Lucas hasn't even been listening to the fans post-Episode I.  Now Jar Jar will be back to haunt us in Episode II.  Don't even get me started on the title of that one, ""Attack of the Killer Clones""(what???).  Whats going on?  You'd at least think his support staff might have objected, but obviously they are just a bunch of ""yes men"".  Former reviewers had written ""don't compare this to the old Star Wars movies"".

I was fooled just like everybody out there, I wanted to believe that the movie I had seen was worth the wait.

3957,,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  I LOVE the first three films, seen them a million times, got the videos, watch them when they're on the tube... and this movie DOES NOT live up to their legacy.  The plot is paper thin... the characters are almost transparent... The action, such as it is, is predictable. They spent 11 minutes (might have been 13, I've forgotten, but I timed it) on the ""pod race"" which had a VERY minimal impact on the plot (what plot?), when the main point of the thing could have been handled in about 3-5 minutes.  Those other 6-8 minutes could have been used to give some substance to the characters. I'm forced to wonder if Liam made them mad?  His character was a cardboard cut-out, apparently designed to be killed for effect, so that Obi-Wan could go on alone.  Darth Maul was even more ephemeral.  He didn't even have a voice, or so it seemed.  He was apparently there to kill Liam and then be gone.  Definitely the weakest link! Yoda and the ""council"" of the Jedi Knights could have used a few minutes of air time to make us believe that they did anything other than say ""no"" to Liam (which, of course, he ignored).  Is Samuel L. Jackson scheduled to show up in future episodes? (I didn't see his name on the credits for Episode II on this site). And Jar Jar Binks???? What a waste of make-up!!!  Question... Why didn't he look anything like the rest of his people???  Why did he appear to be a cross between ""Old Weird Harold"" from the Cosby Kids and ""Roger Rabbit""? Why did we have to suffer through his never-ending babble???",0
3958,,"Well it appears that this movie was poorly laid out but beautifully shot with special effects very few movies can compete with.  This is one of it's redeeming qualities. I doubt that people really care about the plot or the treason and conspiracy going on within the Senate.  Maybe if the actors were to act out with more feeling, we might care about them too. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were the only actors who we were able to watch without cringing.  Jake LLoyd was about as irritating as that next door neighbor kid who keeps throwing his baseball through your living room window. Hell, he can probably act better too. Jar Jar Binks might have been more charming if he was given better dialogue. Natalie Portman is one of the worst actresses I have seen in a long time. and what's with the accent? It looks like she's been getting lessons from Madonna. After the pod race, she barely congratulated young Anakin on his victory, and I never did catch what her lines were half the time. I was too busy wondering who cast her. I never was impressed with her much to begin with and this certainly hasnt made my point of view change. And for God's sake PLEASE stop comparing her to Audrey Hepburn in looks and in talent. It's sacrilege. Overall, bad movie. Let's hope the second is better.",0

On the same evening as i watched this dvd, I watched Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and realised how much of a great film this was compared to the phantom menace...and it's only average trek. 'Empire' is such a magnificent film compared to this tripe....George give us back our religion, and stop trying to explain the unexplainable...give us a story, strong characters, a soul, a film with heart!

3962,1.0,"After forcing die-hard fans to hold their collective breath for years George Lucas finally produced Star Wars, Episode 1, The Phantom Menace. From the moment that he directly quoted his own cliche, ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" I knew that this movie would be a phenomenal disappointment.",0
3963,5.0,"I think a lot of people, even die-hard fans, weren't aware of the fact that even though the story lines for Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith didn't seem relevant to each other, they were all connected so that the eventual takeover of Palpatine would be so subtle as not to alert the Jedi to what he was doing. Palpatine foresaw what was to happen. He knew how to blind the Jedi by the seemingly-disconnected way he controlled everything that happened. The whole situation with moving the Trade Federation to blockade the planet Naboo was all a ruse to reveal that the Supreme Chancellor was a lame-duck and persuade Queen Amidala to propose getting rid of him, so that when the time was ripe, Palpatine would end up looking good in the eyes of the Senate and they would vote him in. He ultimately knew that the Queen wouldn't sit idly by and would want to go back to Naboo to reclaim her planet. She did so and his plan went into motion. As for Darth Maul, I think he was just meant to be a minor plot point. He doesn't really need motivation other than ""He's a Sith. Siths hate the Jedi. They want to be in control and the Jedi won't let them."" Then, in Attack of the Clones, Palpatine once again maneuvered the situation by having the leader of the opposition to creating an army for the Republic be put out of the way. He had Count Dooku persuade the Trade Federation and others to hate the Republic and merge into a great army against it. The Republic would have no choice but to create an army of it's own to defend itself. And the clone army from Kamino was ready just in time. All this under Palpatine's knowing and watchful eye. With Amidala, the opposition leader to the army, out of the way, the bureaucrats and Palpatine slyly convinced Jar Jar Binks to propose giving the Supreme Chancellor emergency powers to create this army, in Amidala's name. Palpatine had to have known that the Separatist droid army could've been usurped by the Republic to defeat the Sith. So, he started a civil war, created an army of clones under his control, ultimately, and destroyed anyone who could've been used to destroy him, except the Jedi. Purging the Jedi and becoming Emperor was, thus, the point of Revenge of the Sith. He convinced the Senate that the Jedi tried to murder him and take over the Republic. After persuading Anakin Skywalker of this and to join him on the dark side, it was easy for Palpatine to use Anakin's knowledge of the Jedi to destroy the temple and every Jedi in it. Then he sent Anakin to destroy the Separatist leaders. And to ""protect"" society, Palpatine proposes that the Republic become a Galactic Empire and he, their Emperor. So, in short, Palpatine was the villain of the entire trilogy. He slowly and methodically got the power he wanted and destroyed anyone who could've destroyed him. I'm not much on the dialogue as a lot of people have said before, but the story was brilliant and extremely subtle.",0
3964,1.0,"It amazes me that anyone, especially die-hard fans of the original films can consider this piece of festering tripe anything other than awful. Firstly, the acting - or lack of. More wood than in a furniture shop. This was not helped by the reliance on the use blue-screen technology so none of the actors get to act on a set. Secondly, that really annoying CGI character who is central to the plot - he was just irritating beyond belief. The list just goes on. The entire pod racing section plodded on for way too long and stank of an excuse to release a video game. How is it that a race that is technologically advanced enough to produce a protective shield that protects their army is unable to produce a weapon more sophisticated than a catapult?. I nearly punched myself out of sheer frustration that the day is saved by accidentally leaning on the trigger causing the laser to accidentally fire and just happen to hit the one critical part of the enemy ship causing it to blow up. Duh. But the worst part of all for me are the huge inconsistencies between it and the original films. To have Darth Vader build C3P0 is frankly ridiculous, and the notion of the Force, so beautifully portrayed as a mystical power that binds the universe together in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as being a quantifiable energy created by bacteria is soul-destroying. For me, this must rate as one of the worst and most disappointing films I have ever seen, and the only time (withe the possible exception of when I optimistically watched the 2nd film in a vain hope of Lucas redeeming himself) that I have left a cinema in a foul mood.",0

3967,,"Maybe it's just because I was young enough to be in the ""target audience"" that you are speaking of when it came out, but I didn't find the movie that bad. Or maybe, it's just because I can remember the basic parts to a story that so many people are forgetting. You see, every story has this thing called an ""exposition"", now you don't need me to explain that to you, who I hope to assume are fairly well educated adults. But just in case...Phantom Menace was not meant to do really anything other then set up the story. Its only purpose was to establish as many answers as it could to existing questions and become a backdrop to the following movies that would follow. It did not have the advantage of starting in the climax like the original Star Wars, therefore it could never have been so action-packed. What kind of epic story does not have some sort of boring introduction? Some of the best books i've ever read started out pretty slow. So give Phantom a break, you expected too much from Chapter 1. Instead of looking at the(I'll admit weak) dialogue and anti-climatic storyline, focus on the other things that make it a good piece of entertainment. The music was stunning, the visuals spectacular, and the acting (except for young Anakin...) was never dull. I don't know about you, but by the end of the movie, I could not wait to find out what happens in the next chapter; and that's all it was meant to do. If you haven't noticed, there are at least three important plot lines in Episode II, which could not fit into the movie if they still had to explain the beginning concepts and characters of the story. So don't give up on Lucas just yet, you have no idea what's in store.",0
3968,,"Let me just say one thing. This movie is great. One of, if not the, best movies of 1999. I mean American Beauty. Ha, I laugh at your American Beauty. Some people take their movies too seriously. They're supposed to entertain, and this movie excells at it. Not be some artistic peice of crap that you think you're supposed to like, but you really don't. And it is very faithful to the series. People get mad because it isn't Star Wars enough. It sure is if the creater of it says so. The creater is the god and he is always right. People complain that is the worst of the series. That doesn't make it a bad movie. And it isn't fair to compare to the others, because that was 20 years ago and things can change. Anyway, about the movie. I think it may have the smartest plot of the trilogy, because the first time seeing it you may even be a bit confused, which makes it more of an involved story. I don't  need to explain the plot, because if you haven;t seen this movie you have been living under a rock. But the final battle scenes are the best in any sci-fi movie to date. Nobody can beat the lightsaber duel at the end. You should really enjoy it. My only gripe about this movie is the amount of computer graphics in this film. Sometimes it makes the film lose character, and if the older films chronologically take place later, it shouldn't make the newer films(1977-1983) look so dated and old. What I'm saying is that they should have not relied on CGI so much. Ending up I would say that the amount of bad reviews may forever hinder the greatness of this masterpeice. Because that is what it is, a modern day masterpeice. You dont find much better nowadays.",1

3970,4.0,"Doesn't make you a great film. I DO like the original Star Wars trilogy, not my favourite films, BUT they are respectable. This is just a view of mine; I'm not having `A Go' at anyone. Where do I start? Well, lets consider the special effects. These predictably are excellent, imaginative, and COMPLETELY noticeable. Ok CGI creates good aliens, spaceships etc, but that's no reason to use them at every possible opportunity. It gets so bad that you get the feeling that the real `actors', are just playing supporting roles to the CGI. The whole film feels like an advert for the Action figures, models etc that came before, and after. What next? How about the script? The original films had a sense of danger, romance and even adult(ish) humour, occasionally. But how on earth can we take so many `oops' and  `yipees' seriously? Were these in the original script? If not how in the hell could any director allow these to be improvised during filming? Not to mention ` Mr Qui-gon sir, I heard you talking about Medichlorians, I was wondering, what are medichlorians?' (The quote may not be exact, but there's no way I'm going to stick the video on to check)   reminds me of the whole `Hello, I'm Mr DNA' speech in Jurassic Park. Achh enough! And don't get me started on the simplistic rehash that is the plotline. The actorsthe majority of which, are fine, considering the material. The one big exception is little Jake Lloyd  - love him. I don't know if the idea of a young Vader was to be an annoying little spoilt brat who despite being a slave, show no signs of emotion or intelligence. If it weren't for the fact the script literally spells out HE MADE HIS OWN RACER etc, then it would be hardly believable. Witness the touching goodbye to his mother and the `Are you an Angel?' speech  breathtaking. Nothing but praise to the other actors, they all put on a good show. The music is great and the Direction and Cinematography look superb. You can't fault the look of the film. Lucas and his team have done a good job of creating fairly believable worlds (`A long time ago, in a Galaxy far, far away' yada yada), and if the film has ONE thing in its favour, it's the design and style of the picture.  There are many memorable scenes through the movie, the Sabre fight sequence at the end being one of the best choreographed fights in a long while. However I do think that Mr Lucas (and I'm sure this isn't only MY opinion) should continue to produce (he's great at that!), but step down from the director's chair, to make room for some new blood. It's a shame that, with all the work that went into the film, the result is a soulless, commercial and standard Sci-Fi film, lacking the heart that the originals had. This could have reinvented the whole star Wars legacy, but to many has spoiled the fantasy. Lets hope that with the next 2 films, the Great Star wars trilogy doesn't become a forgettable mediocre legacy.",0

They had the same faults this one has: non-developed characters, cheesy dialogue, ""you-can-tell-it's-not-real"" special effects, and a befuddling plot.  Who cares!  It's fun!  Lucas gives us just enough heart and soul balanced with comic-book cheese to keep it from becoming either pretentious sci-fi drama or saturday morning fluff. Believe me, episode 2 will correct some of the mistakes of part one.  If you've seen the graphic novel, you know that Jar-Jar, while not having much screen time, will end up playing a critical role in the development of the Empire...one that will almost generate sympathy from even his most hardened critics.

Of course I had seen all of the originals before(if you're 12 and you haven't, then your living under a serious rock)and had seen the phantom menace in theaters when it came out. And I must say, The Phantom Menace is probably the strongest of the Prequel Trilogy. I am writing this review after Episode 2 and 3 came out and to me, they were crap. The entire love interludes between Anikan and Padme were just stupid. It was not like Star Wars. Of course there had been love in Star Wars before, it had never been that much. And it was ALWAYS well done and important to the storyline. This was not. Anyway, The Phantom Menace was Star Wars dumbed down a bit. It was made for the new generation, so of course the humor was different, and some of the elements, but it was still Star Wars.

3986,6.0,"Phantom Menace released in 1999 as a prequel to the three excellent original films, shortly after its release the movie garnered a ton of hate. The film isn't even as close to be as bad as people say, it is actually pretty decent. Let's start off with flaws in the movie, and yes, there are many. First off, the characters, most of these characters are either boring or annoying. Jar Jar Binks and ""Little Ani"" are so annoying and it is so unbelievable that this dumb brat kid becomes Vader. The decoy queen looks so bored out of her mind and talks like a shemale robot. Ewan McGregor looks bored out of his mind in this movie and is terrible until the final lightsaber duel. Darth Maul & Qui Gon Jinn were arguably good characters in my opinion. Other bad things are most of the action sequences. The action is so plain and dumb. How the hell does Anakin ""Accidently"" blow up that donut thing, that scene is unwatchable. The Battle with the Gungans is so boring and just shows off the new CGI technology and not to mention how terrible the pod race scene is. There's a lot more bad other than that but now i will move onto the good. Qui Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are good characters. Darth Maul is menacing and looks like a badass and Qui Gon is a protective Alec Guiness like jedi the only complaint is he almost seems like a carbon copy of Alec Guiness in A New Hope. Some of the action was good The Lightsaber duel is amazing, the raid through Naboo was decent, the opening scene was good, and the scene before they leave Naboo was good. I also grew up with this film so I have a lot of good memories with it, the CGI is very nostalgic to me. Forgot to mention this, the soundtrack is awesome ""Duel Of Fates and ""Droid Invasion"" are great Star Wars-y songs. Movie Rating: 6/10, decent.",0

The movie starts off as any Star Wars movie would with the movie theme and the text. The movie in my opinion started off strong with good action but as the film progressed it back what many had said it to be a bore.

I just watched Empire and ROTJ, Yoda was completely believable, he had so much character. In Episode I he has no character qualities at all, and you have no idea where he's looking! Also, how can they make Jabba's assistant (with the snake-deal around his neck) look nothing like the old one? Every second on Tatooine is worse than forgettable, I wouldn't mind forgettable, this is borderline offensive.",0
3989,1.0,"If this were not Star Wars this film would never have made it past direct-to- video or Syfy markets. The kid who plays Anakin is the worst offender, but even skilled actors like Liam and Ewan and Natalie give lifeless performances. The story is full of holes and the bad guys pose little threat. ",0
3990,1.0,"OK, first of all, I realize this movie has been out for several years but frankly, it's taken me this long to cool down and write a review - hell, I just need to get some things off my chest!",1
3991,6.0,"Let's face it, this was the ""Star Wars"" movie for me to grow up with. So even though it was smashed by critics I didn't really care. However I recently saw it again and I start to understand the criticism. First issue to me: The pace. Especially over the first half of the movie it doesn't take a breath and you get absolutely no idea of the characters. These characters then are jumping from space ship to planet to get to a city underwater, just to ride through the planets core (seriously? even star wars had THAT much logic so far) to get to save a queen/princess (doesn't that sound like a Disney cartoon? Oh, the irony). The problem is that none of these sections feel to be given more than 10 minutes screen time. Like many people before me I too think that a lot of these scenes could have easily been cut out or be replaced with more storytelling. I really think Lucas was a little too much into CGI here. My second issue is the way-through comic tone. I think giving the battle droids a little humor is not a bad choice. But at least the Gungans are way over the top. This is getting especially nerving in actually serious scenes like the big battle in the end. This pretty much kills the atmosphere and makes the movie feel very childish which is in the end what killed it for me. My last big issue is its integration in the overall star wars synopsis. Looking at the plot (not exactly the way it was acted out) this appears to be a fine story in the star wars universe. But let's face it the only thing it really did for star wars was to show Anakin Skywalkers roots and introduce him to his future wife. What I really enjoyed was its cast. Even not in his best role I'm a big fan of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Natalie Portman is okay too. I'm only nerved by young Anakin. Of course the movie has its moments too, especially the final light saber battle and the pot race (which is completely unnecessary).",0
3992,7.0,"The point of this movie is the visual quality of the film. Critics will tell you that this movie is heavily flawed, and 'hard-core' Star Wars fans will hate Jar-Jar Binks, but this blinds people to what they see on the screen. I see great, stunning visuals in a world that has been ingeniously populated by George Lucas. The flaws still exist, which pull down its rating, but the movie serves its point well in making the movie fun. While some acting might be shaky, some dialogue may not be well-written enough to be up to par for ""Star Wars,"" George Lucas always manages to outdo himself with the look of a movie. The Phantom Menace really looks great, and its heart lies with children.",1
3993,3.0,"I admit that when I first saw this film in theaters, I thought it was the greatest. Now I realize that the 16 years between ROTJ and this film would have made me like anything called Star Wars. My wife actually had not seen the other films before this and could have watched them all in episode order. Too bad the movie was too painfully slow and boring to allow that. It's obvious that this film rides the coattails of the others too much. Providing back-story doesn't have to be boring. I haven't even bought the DVD version because I know I'll probably never watch it. Indeed, this film foreshadowed problems with the whole prequel trilogy. Lucas could have improved on the originals with better writing, story and character development. Other reviewers are right in saying that the effects have taken center stage. Style over substance, analogous to our entertainment culture as a whole.",0
3994,3.0,"honestly, i don't know where to start, im currently watching this movie now on my split screen while im typing this, thats how much i am bored.",0
3995,7.0,"Am I supposed to think it a coincidence that Jar Jar sounds so much like another floppy eared cartoon in a live action film? Could he be a more blatant homage to Roger Rabbit? I actually prefer big rubber aliens that don't move to these goofy animations. Switching back and forth between live actors and cartoons of the same actors in impossible situations is even worse, for example, cartoon Qui Gon jumping into Amidala's ship to escape fight with Maul. Don't get me started on Jabba, big rubber alien much better again than cartoon. It seems when poor Greedo died the best alien effects died with him. As for immaculate conception of Ani, I did suspect a ruse. I thought for sure we would discover that a Sith had raped her and she'd blocked it out. Thankfully the movie has continuity with previous films by placing great actors in supporting roles, and amateurs as leads. Hopefully a different director will take the reigns in future, someone who remembers the original vision of the classic hero's journey depicted for the first time in space.",0
3996,5.0,Although Jar-Jar and Anakin are incredibly annoying characters I still think this is a great family film and good for any star wars fans (although it nowhere near as good as the originals) overall it is a pretty good movie especially the lightsaber duels but sadly the characters of what could of been an amazing film do grate quite a bit.,1
3997,5.0,"To be honest I fell asleep when I was in the theater seeing this the first time. When I watched it at home and really paid it the attention I thought it deserved I noticed two things. The CGI is TERRIBLE. Flat, fake...it looks like a bad video game. And then I backed it up (keep in mind, I was watching it on DVD, so it's easy to do that) and I noticed that the CGI aliens mouths didn't at all match the voices. They are aliens - why do they speak what looks like dubbed English? I would have rather hear 'blah blah yadda doo blee be' with subtitles than see badly done CGI characters speaking English with their mouths obviously not matching the words. Other than that, the back story was ok but it's visually an incredibly dated 1990's movie.",0
3998,3.0,"Okay, I was way late to the party on this movie, but nothing I had heard about it made me want to go out of my way to see it. Finally it showed up on cable this past summer. Now I know what I was missing.",1
3999,1.0,"Star Wars is one of my favorite movie franchises. To think of what could have come before the original trilogy used to fill me with wonder, until I saw this movie. The sheer shittiness of this ""movie"" highlights George Lucas's lack of talent as a director and a writer, and proves once and for all that Star Wars succeeded only because there were people around Lucas who challenged his idiocy. The lack of ambition and imagination that went into the Phantom Menace disgusts me.",0
4000,5.0,"I went to see this film during it's first release once the hype died down. I left out of the theatre feeling a bit disappointed. Trade embargoes are not interesting. Now that they are replaying on cable, I gave them another chance. One thing I enjoyed about episodes 4,5 and 6, was the sense of the unknown in learning these new languages as they came up. Hearing Greedo, listening to Jabba and Bib Fortuna as they talked in these exotic tongues which draw you in. In episode 1, I felt at times as if I was watching an exploitation film on bad ethnic stereotypes. I won't list specific characters because I don't have to, you know who the Asian sounding characters are. The characters that have Arabic, Latino, and African American stereotypes. I'm not even black and I get offended watching this Jar Jar character say everything but ""he don't know nothing bout birthin no babies."" My last point and question is, ""Where was Haley Joel Osment when they were casting for Anakin?",0
4001,6.0,"The plot was engaging I felt like I knew the characters,sure there was a over use of CGI,but all around a good film",0
4002,1.0,Jar Jar Binks is the best charcter ever seen on cinema screen. He is such an inspiration for million of people around the world. long live Lord Binks. We will never forget you,1
