0,10.0,"Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!",1
1,8.0,I didn't watch this movie when I was a kid.,0
2,10.0,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).",1

4,9.0,"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.",1
5,10.0,"This movie might not be as flawless as the first two but everything involved with those throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the entire saga, the conflict between luke and vader, the emperor himself finally showing up for the first time and he's so good at being this manipulative evil, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking with that amazing music by john williams and the beautiful ending of the film that brings everything together, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's the second best movie behind the empire strikes back.",1
6,8.0,"Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don't love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.",1
7,,"My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.",1
8,10.0,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows the Jedi and Luke needing to save their ally, Solo, who even after being saved will need to settle his debt with Jabba the Hutt. Meanwhile, Luke seeks out Yoda to finish his training and the Jedi sets out for one last battle against the evil empire. For them to be successful, Luke will likely need to face his father one last time.",1
9,7.0,"...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.",0
10,10.0,"There's a reason why Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader is my favorite character of all time. Even after everything he did, he still fulfilled the prophecy and brought balance to the force. The scene where luke takes off his helmet makes me tear up all the time. Poetry.",1
11,10.0,"Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.",1
12,9.0,"So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.",1
13,10.0,"I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.",1
14,5.0,"In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can't just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I'd chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn't agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi's story makes absolutely no sense in places.",1
15,9.0,"Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.",1
16,10.0,"Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO and R2-D2 go to Taooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the powerful criminal Jabba the Hutt. After many fights, they are well succeeded in their mission. The group returns to the Rebel Alliance base while Luke heads to Dagobah to finish his training with Yoda; however the Jedi is dying and he confirms that Darth Vader (David Prowse) is his father and Luke also learns that he has a sister, Leia. Meanwhile the rebels discover that the Empire is building a new Death Star more powerful than the first one that is protected by an energy shield generated by a generator in planet Endor. Luke and his group goes to the forest in the planet to destroy the generator while Lando and the rebels wait for the right moment to attack the station. The group in Endor teams-up with the inhabitants, Ewoks, to fight against the Imperial troops but they are captured in a trap; Luke is brought to Darth Vader but he refuses to fight against his father. When he meets the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid), he tries to bring Luke to the dark side of the Force. What will happen to Luke and the rebels? ",1
17,8.0,"So I think on a personal note, I prefer this third film over the two others. Simply because it is really good. The movie stars with a time gap between ""The Empire strikes Back"" and it's opening. Which is something I prefer in movies: a time gap of a few days or weeks, maybe months to give the audience a feeling of change. It's better then starting the film exactly where it ended last time. That is one thing. The other is the hugh battle in space that has become a tradition in star wars films, to have large scaled battles in space. The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is really remarkable and gives us a little father - son fight. I mean for real now, don't you get emotional from the scene where Luke and vader talk to each other? Overall the ending on the planet endor is the perfect ending for this perfect trilogy.",1
18,10.0,"Legendary all-encompassing, complete a great final.star warsa not after starting 6 movies 60 movies you would watch, you never want to end this series in this series. .Because all of them are very friendly, cute and warmly created characters.But unfortunately we have to finish the series with the return of the jedi.As Luke enters into a war of will with his father and emperor, the rebels are struggling both in the woods and in space, especially the dialogues between the emperor Darth Vader and Luke are well written and immersive, and the Ewok are so sweet and especially fun to think of 3CPO as a god.",1
19,,"This is the film that pretty much answers all the questions.  One thing that I did notice is that it dealt with the theme of redemption.  Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy the Emperor, the man who cost Vader his soul.  I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films.",1
20,7.0,"Perspective is a good thing.  Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode's II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies.  What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films.  This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"".  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.",1
21,10.0,"After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.",1
22,9.0,"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks!  True, they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don't care if they're marketable.  Yubb Nubb!",1
23,9.0,"At last, I am covering the final installment of Star Wars' original 6 films, before I have to take on the unholy duty of discussing the more recent Disney entries. Even though this film is leaps and bounds ahead of whatever nonsense the franchise's new owners can create, many people don't feel this way about it. Surprisingly, I kind of agree with them. Return of the Jedi is sort of the black sheep of the first 3 movies, and while the first 3 Star Wars films are all excellent, I feel that this one is the least best. I'll explain why later. ROTJ takes place a year after Han Solo has been frozen in carbonite to be transported to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, a large slug-like alien, for a bounty. C-3PO and R2-D2 travel to Jabba's palace on the desert world of Tatooine in order to show Jabba a recording of Luke saying he wants to rescue Han. Princess Leia, disguised in a bounty hunter garb of her own, sneaks into the palace, thaws out Han, and rescues him, but is caught by Jabba and chained to him as his slave. Luke shows up and tries to assassinate Jabba himself, but falls through a trap door into an area where he must fight off a large, carnivorous beast called a rancor. Jabba is infuriated when Luke manages to kill his pet by dropping a portcullis on its head, so he sentences Luke and all his friends to be executed by being eaten by a sarlaac: a sand dwelling creature consisting of a beak, sharp tusks and tentacles. Jabba and the others are taken by floating yachts to the area where the sarlaac is, and as Luke is condemned to jump into its maw, he has R2 shoot his lightsaber to him from Jabba's yacht. After Luke kills almost everyone, Leia strangles Jabba to death with her slave chains and is freed by Luke. After speeding away from Jabba's exploding sail barge, Luke once again flies to the planet Dagobah to hopefully complete his Force training with the help of Master Yoda, whose physical body has become very ill by now. As Yoda's 9 centuries of life come to an end, he tells Luke that it is true that Vader is his father. Outside Yoda's hut, Obi-Wan's ghost tells Luke that he will never be a true Jedi until he comes face to face with his father. Meanwhile, the Rebels find out that Emperor Palpatine is building a new Death Star, which, despite its incomplete appearance, has a fully working superlaser. Han and the others manage to hijack an Imperial shuttle and fly to the forest moon of Endor in order to destroy a shield generator which is providing the Death Star with an impervious defensive forcefield. While there, the group comes across a tribe of what appear to be man-eating teddy bears called Ewoks. While the ewoks and Han's strike team fight the imperials and try to bring down the shield, Luke surrenders himself to Vader's forces so he can meet with his father. Vader tells his son that he's been following the path of evil for too long, and that he will always be part of the dark side. While Luke is brought before Palpatine, a large space battle erupts around the Death Star as rebel forces try to destroy it. Palpatine taunts Luke and urges him to give in to his anger, saying only his hatred and dark side energy can destroy a frail, unarmed old man such as him. Luke tries to swing at Palpatine, but his attack is blocked by Vader's lightsaber. The two fight somewhat inconclusively, until Vader tells Luke that if he won't submit to his inner evil, maybe his sister Leia will. Luke savagely batters Vader with everything he has and cuts off one of his robotic hands. Palpatine is pleased, and says he wants Luke to finish him off so he can replace Vader as his malevolent enforcer. Luke refuses to end his father's life. His plan thwarted, the infuriated Emperor starts using the Force to electrocute Luke to death. Vader watches helplessly, but finally decides to redeem all his past sins by lifting Palpatine up and throwing him down a reactor shaft. Fatally wounding himself by doing so (but saving his son), Vader then asks Luke to remove his helmet so he can see him with his real eyes, if only for this one time. Vader says Luke was right about there being a bit of good in him, and then dies. Luke then puts his father's body in an imperial shuttle and flies off the new Death Star just as it explodes, since the rebel attack on its power core was a success. Back on Endor, Luke attends a party to celebrate the entire galaxy being freed from imperial tyranny. As he cremates Vader's corpse, he sees the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his now redeemed father Anakin watching over him. While I think this movie is still great because (obviously) it's Star Wars and also gets quite sad at the end, there are a few things fans like to harp on it for. For one thing, I thought it was pretty stupid how Leia manages to choke Jabba to death inside his sail barge full of his servants/associates and nobody tries to stop her. A more obvious weakpoint of this film is the introduction of Ewoks. Some people love them, but I personally couldn't stand watching the Empire's soldiers get turned into stooges trying to fight these furry things half their height. The ewoks use ridiculous traps more fitting of a faction such as the Vietcong rather than something out of Star Wars, and they literally show stormtroopers being subdued just by rocks and spears. At least it kind of highlights the fact that huge military industrial complexes can be defeated just by a few people determined to defend their land. As for the positives, there are too many to list. We finally get to see Luke become a Jedi while managing to keep his mind clear of hate; something his father never accomplished. After watching the prequel movies, it's sad when you realize that Anakin has basically been a slave his entire life. He was born one on tatooine, was a slave to the Jedi, and was a slave to Palpatine as Darth Vader. Seeing such an evil character like him turn good was deeply moving. Speaking of Vader, there is a somewhat annoying inconsistency only present in the last 30 or so seconds of the film. For some reason, George felt it necessary to replace the original actor playing Anakin's ghost (Sebastian Shaw). Now, it's Hayden Christensen. I know the logic is that they're trying to make Anakin look like the way he did before he became evil, but didn't he redeem himself by killing the Emperor? Aside from the various changes made in the re-releases of this movie, it is still my belief that Return of the Jedi is an enjoyable, moving, and fitting end to the original Star Wars saga.",1
24,10.0,"This final entry in George Lucas's STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.",1
25,10.0,"This is such a great ending to not only the first 3 but all 6. The empire is defeated, Luke becomes a Jedi, Han and Leah get together, the emperor's plan back fires and Anakin proves that he is the chosen one.",1
26,10.0,After ''Empire strikes back'' ''Return of the Jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.,1
27,9.0,"The Return of the Jedi was George Lucas's last Star Wars film for 16 years, until he followed it up with the disappointing prequel The Phantom Menace in 1999. At the time that I am writing this review, Episode II has come out and proved that George Lucas is still able to produce an action packed space adventure (although he also proves that he is relying far too much on computer generated effects), and we are eagerly awaiting the release of Episode III in 2005, the film which has more possibilities than any of the Star Wars films since the original in 1977. ",0
28,10.0,"""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983 was a great way to end the ""Star Wars"" saga the film was a blast as the Rebels and Jedi Knight(Luke) finally won the civil war against Lord Vader and the evil empire. From the start this film begins with action and drama as Skywalker returns to his old stomping grounds his home of Tatooine, but a special mission in plans that's the rescue of Han Solo from the slimy Jabba the Hutt. Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang are along side Luke for the journey that after the defeat of Jabba they land on the forest moon of Endor, it's here that Lucas introduced us to furry little creatures we loved that's the Ewoks! The Ewoks join up with the rebels to fight the empire, though Luke must handle his own business against Vader and the evil that is tempted upon him. The showdown between Luke and Vader is classic as it's over before the death of evil a final sad good bye is said, and Luke gets to see his father without the mask. The torch has finally been passed and the rebels are free and Luke the Jedi Knight rules superior. Really again a super film from Lucas with drama, and action and excitement from start to finish he picked a good way to end the saga. We will always remember George's creations, his characters, plots, and the musical scores of John Williams will never leave your mind, and final thanks to Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill who all were magnificent in all three legendary classics.",1
29,10.0,"The original Star Wars series was brilliant and should have been left there, especially the ending of this film as It was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. Original, ahead of its time and great writing/story.",1
30,10.0,"Despite the original Star Wars trilogy being considered one of the greatest trilogies of all time it's final instalment Return of The Jedi is only considered to be good and I have to say that not only do I think this movie is on par with the past two entries, I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.

36,9.0,"Some people have disliked this film, and I truly don't see why. ""Return of the Jedi,"" does not, contrary to popular opinion, ruin the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy but rather ties it up in a perfectly satisfying way. The opening scenes at Jabba the Hutt's palace are well done. Jabba is a much meaner and scarier villain here than the short clip in the 1997 re-release of ""A New Hope"" showed him to be. Luke Skywalker is forced to make his most difficult choices in this film, and the intensity of the film's last half-hour is some of the most compelling film-making I've ever seen. The themes and messages of redemption and good vs. evil are superbly done here. ""Return of the Jedi"" is a very exciting and engaging film, memorable and worth watching many times, especially now that Episode III has been made. It's not as perfect as the previous two Star Wars films were, but it is a very pleasing and happy conclusion to an amazing story. The fourth best in the saga, behind the two originals and Episode III. Nearly perfect.",1

38,8.0,"When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective. The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor. It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padmé and the love she felt for her children. Actually while the new films (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. They make the old films seem even better.",1
39,6.0,"As a child, I owned all of the original Star Wars trilogy on VHS, purchased when 'remastering' was all the rage and the iconic sci-fi saga found itself on the receiving end of a much-needed cleaning-up. This was, however, before George Lucas tampered with his already- near-perfect legacy, adding unneeded special effects and elongating certain scenes for seemingly no other reason to show how far CGI had come (although it now looks incredibly dated). Despite the perfection of episodes four and five, my go-to Star Wars movie on a boring Sunday afternoon was always Return of the Jedi, the third instalment now widely remembered as the poorest of the bunch. I don't quite know what it was about Jedi that always caused me to reach for it. It certainly wasn't the Ewoks, those cuddly fur-balls shoe-horned in to sell more merchandise, although they aren't as annoying or distracting as I remembered.",0

There's more special effects (some good, some cheesy) and more new characters and creatures, including the Ewoks.  What makes Jedi the least perfect, is that it's very routine -- more of a reworking of ""Star Wars."" There's more new surprises, though.  A victory is celebrated at the end.  New scenes are featured in the ""special edition."" The ending is very satisfying.  My evaluation: ***1/2 out of ****.",1
41,9.0,About the only criticism I can make of Return Of The Jedi is that the film could easily have been two films. The story of Han Solo's rescue from Jabba The Hut and then the final confrontation with the Empire should have been two films. That would have been double the pleasure for fans of the series. As it stands now the folks there in that galaxy far away are in a happy ever after ending of their saga.,1

48,4.0,"Spoilers: I remember looking so forward to this as a kid after loving the first two movies. They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I'd get at Toys-R-Us and I'd eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as ""Revenge of the Jedi."" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously ""comic book"" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke's sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don't even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.",0

IMDb ranks ""The Empire Strikes Back"" above ""A New Hope"", with ""Jedi"" coming in a distant third.

People have enjoyed talking crap about the Ewoks, but those same people forget that these movies are geared towards families, and you need the cute to counter the ugly.

The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Ian McDiarmid (Emperor) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader) and Frank Oz (Yoda).",0

This is not only an excellent movie or Star Wars movie, I'll even argue this is just as good as Empire. Almost better if the Luke vs Vader fight was a microsecond longer. Empire is great but overrated. The following is my official ranking for all the Star Wars movies to date. New Hope > Jedi > Empire > > Sith > Menace > Rogue > > Awakens > Clone.

I enjoyed the heightened sense of comedy as well as a more of a fee for adventure, something that was sort of lacking in the second. We learn a lot of new secrets, one of them in involving Leia. For the most part, it's done well. It's kind of shocking to see just how negatively this and the second in the series were received when they came out, and how much their reputations have improved. Overall, I wouldn't say this is anything amazing, but certainly recommended.",1

And why did they dress Carrie Fisher like they did early in the movie? Oh well. Life goes on. Now that we've had episodes 1-3, we see where this all originated.

However, this movie really bothers me every time I see it. The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous ""I AM YOUR FATHER"", Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show! The bottom line is, this is the most OVERRATED movie in the history of Hollywood!!!",0

We also learn of the empire, which is constructing a new Death Star.  Then the movie gets to the weaker part of the film where they go to Endor which just looks like any North American woods rather than any alien world.  And we are introduced to the ewoks who are nowhere near the pain that Jar Jar would later become.  There is also a cool space battle with Lando in command while Han leads a team to destroy a shield generator on the planet.  Luke goes and confronts Vader as well.

Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see. Considering the film picks up exactly where Empire Strikes Back ends you really need to watch all three films but this one installment makes the entire original series worth while. Return of the Jedi is by far the best!!",1

Speaking of Leia, there is a shocking revelation in this film that will floor you (I won't go and spoil it for the 6 remaining people in the world who haven't seen it yet). There is also a spectacular equipoise of the poignant and the absurd in this film. It has more poetry and humanity than all S.W. movies before or after it. I laud all involved.

Also, a group of freedom fighters (led by Han Solo), try to shut down a power base on the moon Endor that is controling the second Death Star.

The opening scene on Tatooine is great to say the least and Jabba's palace is excellent. When Luke enters it gets only better, the dark and mysterious entrance being great. Now a true Jedi, Skywalker has no need for a blaster and simply uses the force to silence his foes....PERFECT!!! The Rancor was a nice monster but the next scene is even better at the pit of 'Sarlac' where Luke nearly single handily defeats Jabba and co.

94,5.0,"Return of the Jedi is a fun and pleasant movie, but adds little to the Star Wars universe in the way of novel ideas or character investment (arguably Anakin aside). The movie runs along two storylines: the darker Luke storyline of him becoming a Jedi and confronting his father, and the lighter storyline of Han and Leia continuing to be in love and work with the Ewok. The latter storyline was cute, but utterly uneventful. Nothing new happens with Han or Leia, and the Ewoks are given far too much screentime for their one-dimensionality as just cute and somewhat strong things, so that storyline ended up being rather boring. The Luke one definitely held more tension - the late scenes with him, Vader, and Palpatine were exciting and built well to the climax. Unfortunately, that climax was quite a disappointment, for several reasons. First, unlike the previous one, we get little in the way of Luke's character development and have little reason to be invested in or root for him. Second, Luke's ability to hold his own with Vader and Palpatine was unrealistic - why not pout some physical restrictions on him until he agrees to serve you? But the biggest frustration is what the plot hinges on: Vader's transition to help Luke. Luke doesn't really do or say anything novel, and Vader is a smart guy who has thought about this issue long and hard, and yet Luke being there is enough to just get him to switch? Vader is so deeply established and has been working as a head of the Empire for years, a conviction that should not be so easily shaken. He didn't raise his son but left him at birth, so there's hardly even a huge familial connection. We aren't given anything to latch on to in explaining Vader's monumental shift. Between the lack of interest in the other storylines and the disappointment in the way the climax is resolved, the pleasant effects, acting, and other peripherals present in all three are not enough to save Return of the Jedi from fun but easily forgettable mediocrity.",0
95,10.0,Here's my Review for the Trilogy,0
96,3.0,"this one lacked a certain edge that the other two had. not to mention that ""Luke, I Am Your Father"" was a lot better than ""Leia's My sister!"" that was just plain silly, not to mention as to how Leia reacted to that. was that the same Princess Leia that said classic lines like: ""I'd rather Kiss A Wookie!""? that was one of the wussiest displays of emotions I have ever seen. The Lightsaber Battles just weren't as intense as in Empire Strikes Back, and the death Star II.  Ha! Like we haven't seen THAT before, and those Ewoks! Man, what a dumb Idea! Living Teddy Bears? what Kind of Allies are that?",1
97,1.0,"Return of the Jedi is an example of a film that had to many changes before release.<br /><br />Changing Chewbacca's planet to a teddy bear planet. removing Lucas's original idea of Luke going on a quest for revenge and replacing it with a reunion with daddy.<br /><br />Jedi proves it's no simple task being a Star Wars film.<br /><br />While the actors still give their all, the alien design is still good as are the landscapes.<br /><br />It's the plot itself which kills it, not to mention some dumb character deaths (Boba Fett anyone?) Return of the Jedi lacked the darkness, depth and intensity of Empire.<br /><br />I'll never be able to understand how anyone can rate this 9 or 10 stars. It's just plain bad.<br /><br />I don't recommend it, it's a terrible ending to the original trilogy.",0

This also has many emotion-stirring parts to it and awesome suspenseful battle scenes and I think that it's one of the best final films to a trilogy that there are and can be! Everything wrapped up well, and the crappy Disney sequel should not have been made since this was a great conclusion and how Palpatine ""died"" was perfect! The only valid thing that came after this was the Mandalorian and maybe the Book of Boba Fett.",1

I actually think it was neat to see how such primitive weapons could beat the Empire, which after all was Lucas' intent. Nevertheless, I agree this is the weakest film of the original trilogy.

I mean, Princess Leai is in some wooded area on some planet or whatever, and she sees these oversized teddy bears running around in what appears to be bandanas and sling-shots. What? Where? Who?

Not some Jedi named Rey and claims to be a skywalker just because she defeated an old rotten Palpatine with a cringy line ""I'm all the Jedi"" when Palpatine was ORIGINALLY killed by Darth Vader in this movie. This masterpiece captures all the aspects and doesn't fail to keep the audience to jump out of their seats. It's a tragedy that George Lucas gave the franchise to Disney in hope that they would make an amazing sequel, but was rather extremely disappointed. I hope the Obi Wan Kenobi series won't be ruined. It's a shame to call episodes 7,8 and 9 a part of the SW franchise. Back when SW was authentic and amazing.",1

114,,"""Return of the Jedi"" is probably the weakest of the original three installments in George Lucas's series, but that is not to say that it is not still a very good film that more than delivers in the end.  Rebels led by Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Billy Dee Williams now come at the Empire with everything they have.  In the end it will be an all or nothing venture that will forever change the lives of all involved.  All the questions will be answered and all the loose ends will be tied together. Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) and his forces will not yield easily though.  The screenplay is focused once again and the direction by Richard Marquand this time is smart and outstanding.  A worthy film to end the original trilogy.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",1

118,9.0,"This is Episode VI, the last film of the Star Wars trilogy, and the third one to be filmed. And, it is, I think, the best of the trilogy. Here, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt, and are set to complete their mission of restoring freedom in the Galaxy. Joining them are the little furry friends called the Ewoks. This time, the Emperor himself oversees the construction of the new Death Star by Darth Vader. From there on, it is the fight to be finish, in an epic battle of good vs. evil. What results is another breathtaking action-filled movie, with great direction by Richard Marquand, awesome script by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, superb music score by John Williams and terrific special effects. This film offers hope and rebirth, character development and beautiful sceneries like the galactic city. In addition, there are two spectacular battles: one in the forest and one in the Death Star. Fast-paced and action packed - no boring fillers or sub-plots. ",1
119,,"Jedi is considered by hard core fans to be the weak link.  I don't think so. It's exciting, it's never dull and it neatly takes care of all the loose ends that Empire gave us.  The movie starts off by showing the new Death Star and a very serious Darth Vader.  Then it's off to Tattooine where Luke and company escape from Jabba the Hutt in a great light saber/blaster shoot out.  Yoda confirms Luke's fears and Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must confront Darth Vader.  The speeder bike chase, the blooming relationship between Han and Leia and that forest battle!  Wow!  But the main crux of the film is between Luke and Vader, and The Emperor.  The duel between Luke and Vader is spectacular, and when Luke loses it after Vader goads him into it is just amazing.  In defeating Vader, Luke stands to become him.  Vader turning on his Emperor is outstanding.  The force theme swells on the soundtrack and the Emperor is tossed down to the bowls of the Death Star. Quite a comeback for someone who was pure evil in the last two films.  Throw in one hell of a space battle and you've got yourself a film that will entertain you and blow your socks off.",1

I found A New Hope to be over hyped, and frankly subpar in the emotional connection (or lack thereof) that you have with the characters and as such, I simply could not get into the film. But I gave it another go and boy am I glad I did. In the trilogy, this was the very best yet.

And I can't review this movie without saying how awesome Luke Skywalker is in this film. He is no longer the Luke we knew from A New Hope. He has grown and matured since we last saw him. Overall a alright end to the trilogy and to the oringial six films.,0

Yet the confrontation between Luke Skywalker and the emperor AMAZINGLY portrayed by Ian McDiarmid as well as Vader's redemption are simply superb and out of question, with the most touching moments of the entire saga all depicted here.

128,10.0,"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.",1
129,1.0,"How can any adult who enjoyed ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" possibly find anything entertaining, or even interesting, about this abysmal, unimaginative travesty?  A genuinely bad movie, truly awful in every possible way, ""Jedi"" features a screenplay aimed squarely at four year olds and absolutely terrible acting from an understandably embarrassed cast; in addition, the film offers us the shoddiest array of cheap, plastic-looking space aliens since Irwin Allen's ""Lost In Space"" tv series. Yes, I realize it is this very cheapness that endears the movie to a legion of kitsch loving fans, but, as a direct follow-up to ""Empire,"" one of the most entertaining and inventive fantasy movies of the last twenty years, ""Jedi"" comes across as a particularly insulting spit in the face from George Lucas.

Thankfully this saga successfully integrated that in so the eye candy doesn't overpower it all. This last installment has got a bit of a bad wrap due to its over-emphasis on action, and less on emotional pathos, but I disagree since it all wraps everything from the previous two up perfectly. Some have frowned upon the Ewoks, but I love them. They're cuddly and they prove very resourceful against the Imperial Empire (they're the Birnham Wood that came to Duinsane Hill). I actually adore Leia in the Gold Metal Bikini, very gorgeous eyeful!! My favorite part however, is Luke's last battle. Returning the favor with a hand slice finish, he prove's what a real Jedi is.

In the land of the blind,... but I digress.",1
143,9.0,"The epic space opera adventure continues in Episode 6 with it set 1 year after 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Following on from the entrapment of Han Solo by Jabba the Hutt and the news broken to Luke Skywalker by Darth Vader, explaining that the Sith Lord is in fact his father. The two famous droids R2-D2 and C-3PO are integral characters to the Star Wars saga, with 3PO supplying his protocol skills and impressive memory bank, and, R2's navigation skills and ability to hack into various systems. The pair begin the watch when they are sent to Jabba's palace on Tatooine in a trade bargain made by Luke Skywalker to rescue Han Solo. Disguised as a Bounty Hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretence of collecting the bounty on Chewbacca and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved, held hostage by Jabba himself. Jabba the Hutt is a puppet character, marshalled by three men inside his thick rolls. He is best known for his large size, slimy skin and low-pitched voice that produces saliva when ever he speaks. The crime lord has connotations with a slug, in his overall appearance and lazy nature, there is an extreme lack of movement from Jabba as he is predominantly placed on a stand and surrounded by his slaves, doing things for him. His profession entailed trafficking in illegal good, piracy and of course slavery that generated the planet of Tatooine's wealth, making his business so successful. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by rancor, an immense, warm-blooded predator native to Dathomir. After Luke kills rancor by brutally slicing him by opening and closing an escape door, Jabba sentenced him, Han (who can barely see) and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the Sarlacc, a huge, carnivorous plant-like desert beast. Having hidden his new lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke frees himself and battles against Jabba's guards, on a ship hovering above the sanded trap. As Luke engages battle, Leia cleverly chokes Jabba with the chains she was connected to whilst enslaved by the gangster, killing him. Han and Chewbacca combine to save a fallen Lando, inches of sliding into the Sarlacc's trap, obtaining the pilot and fleeing with Luke and Leia. As the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with the Force. The ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire. The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. In a sequence of chases, Scout troopers, also known as biker scouts, were plotted in the forest as a part of the Imperial army, many of which were defeated in a high speed bike race, featuring Luke and Leia. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. The Ewoks are bear-like and seem to occupy their own language. Their tribe are all small creatures and armed with sticks that they poke to those alarming them or trespassing. Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is he father, and that he must confront him. This overwhelms Leia who struggles to believe the news, but trusts Luke and knows he is doing the right thing. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tried to convince his father to reject the Dark side of the Force, to no avail. Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the Dark side, as he did to Anakin. The Emperor - withered and weak - reveals in his sinister tone that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a cleverly executed counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator, purely due to the Ewoks teamwork and knowledge of their village. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian in the Millennium Falcon and Admiral Ackbar lead the Rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them, cue Ackbar's famous line... The salmon-skinned admiral is a member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, his role as military commander of the Rebel Alliance is crucial to the organisation of any mission. His large fish eyes and unusual appearance, encouraged his voice actor Erik Bauserfeld after just one look at the character, although, Ackbar is a puppet portrayed by Timothy D. Rose. The Emperor informs Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke fo give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the Dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's prosthetic hand. The Emperor is impressed by Luke's attributes, almost a carbon copy to when he saw Anakin defeat Count Dooku, and entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke's loyalty to the Rebellion means he refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightening, the same that helped kill Mace Windu. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader considers Luke's pain and suffering that the Emperor is causing, seeing that his son can't fight back he lifts up the Emperor and throws him down a reactor shaft to his death, but Vader is mortally electrocuted in the process. Luke supports Darth Vader until the Sith Lord can't continue, resting on the ground, he requests his son to remove his mask, so that Anakin Skywalker can take a proper look at his son, the redeemed Anakin dies in his son's arms, in a moving scene. After the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the Super Star Destroyer's executor. The colossal capital ship is both utilised as a forward operating base and as a mobile weapon systems platform, the Star Destroyer is known to be the headquarters of the Empire. Lando and the X-Wing fighter pilot Wedge Antilles destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the Falcon escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. Returning to the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a pyre before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the Galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi Wan and Anakin watching proudly over him. As the original saga ends, 6 well-directed films make up the achievement of bringing peace and prosperity to the Galaxy. The 6 Episodes feature incredible characters, intense battles, defeat leading to despair, and success leading to celebration. With many deaths along the way, the journey beginning with the 'Phantom Menace' and ending with the 'Return of the Jedi' reinforces the key message, and how integral teamwork and leadership skills are. The power of the Force is something not to be tampered with and is the heartbeat of the Jedi credentials. With major setbacks, the Republic was no more, the Galactic Empire evolved, so too did Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. The Empire's target of dominating the Galaxy was imminent with the construction of the Death Star, but with help of many unsung heroes who sacrificed themselves to obtain and pass on schematics of the superweapon, allowed the newly formed Rebellion to counteract the Empire. Luke - the 'New Hope' - destroyed the Death Star, and witnessed the death of Palpatine and his father, who helped him by killing the Emperor, before dying in his arms. Peace was restored across the Galaxy!",1

146,10.0,"I know this movie is considered the weakest of the original trilogy, but to me it's always been my favorite ever since I was a little kid. The entire rescue sequence is so creative, so well thought out. The ending is amazing. I love the ewoks, who might look weak and little, but in a group together with the rebels are brave and strong, that's a message that Star Wars always has. Luke being tempted to hate but strong enough to resist is such a cool thing to see. The entire battle between Darth Vader and Luke is classic. And then their last emotional moment is just...wow. The original trilogy contains only masterpieces and joy. When I think about it, I transform into the kid who watched star wars for the first time, not knowing what it is, and then getting a feeling of true passion. And George has passion. We even see it in the prequels. And since Disney runs the show, things have not been quite the same. The magic dissapears. Vader, Luke,etc are milked dry until the spark is gone. They're not special anymore. That's what Disney misses. Force Awakens had it, but it hasn't been quite consistent. GIVE US STAR WARS BACK DISNEY!!!",1
147,9.0,"Return of the Jedi is certainly the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy, but fortunately we have the redemption of Darth Vader arc which goes and salvages the entire film. Without it the movie would be a disappointment on par with the Matrix 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, The Godfather 3, the Hobbit 3, and all of cinema's other failed three-quels.<br /><br />The road to Vader's redemption is quite bumpy, however. All the Jabba's palace scenes, while relentlessly creative, really add nothing to the overall story and function simply as a protracted and needlessly convoluted procedure into bringing back Harrison Ford. That being said, these scenes are probably where the original trilogy gets closest to its pulpy inspirations as possible-I've read a fair share of 1930s pulp sci-fi, and everything in these scenes (goofy monsters, rancor pit, bikini slaves) simply SCREAMS 1930s sci-fi. It's interesting but ultimately not that necessary.<br /><br />Once we get to Endor the movie improves. After some sluggish pacing and a perfectly shot speeder bike chase, we finally get to see Luke's confrontation with the Emperor, which is where the movie really succeeds. The scenes with Luke and his father on the Death Star are probably the most powerful of any Star Wars movie ever; they also give the story meaning, and even achieve a moral statement that nearly no American blockbusters even try to show. Kudos to Lucas for pulling that off. (Also, it's not against Vader's character that he turned to the light side; is it so surprising that he would chuck Palpatine down the chasm when the latter was literally trying to get his son to kill him a few minutes ago?)<br /><br />Meanwhile, the rest of the battle of Endor is pretty excellent. Lucas likes multi-front battles woven together-the Phantom Menace had an even more complex one-and he delivers here. While a second Death Star implies creative bankruptcy, the space battle above it is more exciting and massive than in the original film. The Endor forest battle is controversial, and the Ewoks defeating the Empire's 'best troops' is a little cheesy, but it's still exciting for what it is. (And when watching it for the first time, I was probably one of the only kids who got the references to the Swiss Family Robinson film from 1960.)<br /><br />Anyway, the fact remains that the ending is perfect for the Skywalker saga, bringing the two previous movies, and yes, the prequels, full circle. Why follow it up with a mediocre sequel trilogy bent on giving all these characters terrible ends? The empire was destroyed forever, and balance was restored. Let them celebrate. They won.",0
148,,"Return of the Jedi is superior to The Empire Strikes Back, but is no where near as good as A New Hope. Jedi was a lot less dark than Empire and that was appealing. The final space battle was truly excellent and far better than those of the rest of the original trilogy. And the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader was even better than the one in Empire. Even the Ewoks could not ruin this for me. Like Empire, Jedi was unable to be as dramatic and amazing as A New Hope. Return of the Jedi does not even come close to A New Hope but it is still a good film. Don't miss it.",1
149,,"Return of the Jedi seems to be very popular and so it should be...amongst kids. Anybody old enough to drink however will be left fairly unimpressed by George Lucas' third Star Wars film, unless they're some kind of sci-fi obsessive. I fail to understand why Star Wars is consistently voted one of the best series of all time. Sure the films have their moments, but its very concerning that people have devoted their lives to them! There are too many ridiculous and immature moments in Return of the Jedi to make it anything other than a good kid's movie. The army of teddy bears at the end lowers the quality of the film immensely. The obese frog creature Jabba is welcome, but they go and kill him off too quickly. Harrison Ford steals the film, but isn't in it enough. Skywalker is at times far too worthy and righteous. The robots are just plain irritating, one of them just making inane beeping noises and the other sprouting out nonsense in an ultra-camp English accent. Overall, not one of cinema's best offerings......",0
150,,"Return of the Jedi is so often characterized as the ""weakest"" installment of the Star Wars trilogy that some of the series' finest moments and set pieces are overlooked.  The entire sequence at Jabba the Hutt's palace is a tour-de-force in the grand tradition of pirate adventure films and the resolution of the Darth Vader/Luke Skywalker storyline displays some tremendously powerful emotions.  Additionally, one might argue that the climactic light saber battle between Vader and Skywalker is the best duel of the whole series, combining brilliant editing, lighting design, and amazing music cues.  Finally, I can hardly imagine a more exciting cinematic thrill ride than the potent Endor speeder bike chase.  My favorite image, however, is the silhouette of Luke as the smoke from Vader's funeral pyre rises into the night sky.",1

Not anymore. A lot of the special effects don't work as well as they used to. They look very dated. That normally wouldn't bother me but as the look of ""Return of the Jedi"" diminishes, the weakness of the script becomes more pronounced. The acting by the three leads (Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford) isn't so hot either. All three of them seem to be going through the motions most of the time. Often when I watch this movie now, I feel like I'm watching a two hour toy commercial. There are still some exciting moments in ""Return of the Jedi"" but the bloom is definitely off the rose.",1
156,9.0,"I love the entire original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and I grew up watching them. And as a child I did like the ewoks a lot. But now having grown up I find it way too much that the military-trained forces of the Galactic Empire were bested by the primitive ewoks.",0

159,9.0,"Where do I stand on Star Wars? Well, all 6 of George Lucas' films are strong, iconic, and technologically brilliant displays of childhood imagination writ large. Youthful space adventures bound together by universal themes. Fan Fiction entries aside, Star Wars is great. That said, the official end of Lucas' saga, Return of the Jedi, may be my favorite of the whole bunch. With a mix of the jubilant excitement of A New Hope, the sophisticated themes of Empire Strikes Back, and a surplus of new wonders from the mind of George Lucas, Return of the Jedi is the ultimate realization of the Original Trilogy.",1

Han Solo is completely different - pure comic relief, only not funny at all. I'm a little bummed actually. I loved this movie when it came out back in '83 and was very excited to revisit it. As I sat here watching it my heart just kept sinking lower and lower. Is this the same movie I saw in the theatres?? What's up with all the cutesiness? And the myriad issues extend far beyond the infamous and very problematic Ewoks. The whole thing is just cheeseball bad. It's very poorly put together - poorly edited throughout, Boba Fett's demise is cartoonishly out of place, did I mention Han Solo is a complete waste of space? I could go on and on and on. I mean wow, George Lucas jumped the shark 30 years ago! The Phantom Menace was simply a continuation of the already declining quality. I'm sitting here in a state of quiet, disappointed shock.",0

167,6.0,This films functions far better as a predictor of the terrible prequels than as a sequel of the first two films. Several factors-the Ewoks are the lest of it-work to make this film exceptionally weak. It adheres too closely to repeating A New Hope ala Beowulf. The incest being retroactively added to Empire does not help. Worse the film is split into distinct sections that don't function as a story overall. This film is really two stories-the rescue of Han and Death Star 2.0. Neither one is given proper to time breath and they don't gel together.,0
168,8.0,"One of the best of all parts this part has much in it. Luke's turning as a Jedi; disclosure of relationship between Leia and Luke and most interesting of all the turning of Vader to light to save his son.<br /><br />The action fight of Luke with Vader was interesting and so was Vader's throwing off the Supreme Leader. On the creative part entry of the Ewok; their support for the cause and above all 3 PO as a deity :) nothing more comical than that.<br /><br />Chewei has always been an entertainer and more in this when he and Ewok control the war machine to strike enemies down. <br /><br />The most heart touching was the arrival of souls of Obi-Wan, Yoda and 'Anikan' during the celebration after defeat of the dark force. Loved watching it.",1

That makes it bad!  Everyone liked Return of the Jedi until someone in a Kevin Smith movie made a negative comment about it.  Now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it.  This movie is so much better than anything Kevin Smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it.  This movie is good fun!

And you can't escape the Lucasfilm merchandising muscle when watching this.",0
172,8.0,"Return of the Jedi (1983) is often cited as being the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy and I would be inclined to agree.

175,4.0,"The final episode starts with the most hilarious sequence of events you could come up with for a Star Wars movie. It's unnecessarily long, awkward, strange, convoluted and just ridiculous. It then continues on in this spirit, killing off interesting characters like they were nothing, showing off Luke's acquired strength at every turn (he's indestructible, but still seems like a clumsy kid), but that isn't to say this movie is bad. It's just not as good as the other entries in the franchise. What saves it is the storyline leading up to the final scene with Darth Vader, which is incredible. The rest of the movie isn't. The Ewoks especially are terrible. Not only do they look like puppets, they feel completely out of place. It's the only Star Wars movie during which you're taken completely out of the immersion by the movie itself, and it does this repeatedly, only to be saved at the last moment. Storm troopers are a joke.",0

Many people put it down for not being so great but lets think about this, it had the final battle between Skywalker and Vader, the rebels destroyed the death star,and we visited new places such as Jabas palace and the moon endor and they included many new characters like Jaba, the ewoks, and Emperor Palpatine. Now what more could you ask for in a movie. It was a great and sometime underrated ending to a great trilogy. Not to mention it made more money then Empire Strikes Back.

188,7.0,"I think most consider this to be the weakest movie of the original trilogy, and it is, though it's not bad either. It has lost a star for additions to it post prequel trilogy, one of the worst of which turns that disgusting Sarlacc creature (sand beast that devours people dropped into it) into Audrey from the Little Shop of Horrors, and some other additions. I forgot about that particular addition, and it made me rage again upon seeing it when recently watching the movie on Disney+. It's original version was far more impressive, as a giant thorny hole in the sand, and much more menacing as a result. In addition I didn't much care for adjustments to the entertainment in Jaba the Hut's base, those moments seeming to be particularly disjointed. With respects to original elements, the Ewoks, while cute, do seem to be something of a mistake, in that they occupy too much movie time, with no meaningful amount of Ewok character development - there was indeed a regular one that popped up more often than the others, but they didn't go to any lengths to make that really resonate. Endor also seemed a location that had little meaning, in so far as that new death star's development was concerned - I suppose it would have been a tactically discrete location for construction, and testing maybe, but it didn't make all that much sense either, in terms of ramping up the stakes! Had it had its sights set on Tattooine, for example, the stakes may have elevated a good deal more.",0

After the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of ""A New Hope"" and the thrilling sophistication of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" I remember awaiting ""Return of the Jedi"" with almost aching anticipation. But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, I was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at Lucas. He should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, I call Jarjar Binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).",0

193,5.0,"Okay, I give up.  Apparently George Lucas thought that Star Wars did so well because of the merchandising.  Thus, from his head did burst forth the Ewok. (Ewoks seem to be based on Australian tribes people, which is actually a lot better than the crazy Jar-Jar primitive race alien in Ep. 1.)  The story for this movie is excellent, the movie itself is just so half-assed.  I think the entire movie can be judged on the scene in which Luke is fighting off the giant monster creature in Jabba's lair.  The blue screen my weatherman uses looks better than that.  There was really no point in adding new scenes to this film, if not to clean up at least that one shot.  And although Lucas never expected to shoot Empire or Jedi, I'm sure that somewhere in the back of his head he must have been thinking that Mark Hammil would mature into an actor with a more Jedi-like screen personality. Please vote for this movie, I gave it a 5 out of 10, help get it out of the top 50 at least.",0

However, upon my revisit, I find myself with a far more muted reaction, and it kind of makes me sad.",1
198,9.0,"I recall the controversy some time prior to the original theatrical release regarding the title. ""Revenge of the Jedi"" was scrapped because it was deemed too harsh for mainstream movie audiences and didn't fit in with the noble character of the Jedi Knights. I couldn't quite understand that argument considering all the country had gone through after Watergate and Vietnam, and since movies and other forms of entertainment were getting more and more outrageous. Still, ""Return Of The Jedi"" works pretty well to convey the essence of the story, as Luke Skywalker stays true to his promise to avoid falling to the peril of the Dark Side of the Force.",1

Fans of the possibly biggest franchise in film history often consider this one the weakest from the 3 early films, but I cannot agree with this sentiment. It may even be my favorite from the trio. They included many interesting new characters, elaborated nicely on the old ones and there is one of the most famous villains in film history in here. The locations are fairly great to watch as well.",1
200,10.0,The best Star Wars movie ever in my opinion. It should be more appreciated,1
201,,"Return of the Jedi is a serious twisting pain after the highlight, both in storytelling and power, of Empire Strikes Back.  Lucas thinks he knows so much about such topics as military tactics, politics, religion, and so on, but he is no more than a teenager with an overactive imagination.  He doesn't understand these concepts unlike more mature filmmakers like Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott.  Lucas' head is so far in Never Never Land that reality, even in his Star Wars universe, becomes something he constantly changes the rules to fit his needs.  He isn't a smart creator.  James Cameron was the same way with The Abyss, but that product was ten times better than this.  Both of them have their naive fantasy traits locked in this series, but Cameron has gone to the modified Heavy Metal routine.",1

This is an good movie and more importantly a superb ending.",1
204,8.0,"Return of the Jedi is the third film to be made in the Star Wars saga but the sixth film chronologically and hence the last of the films. This means that it must wrap up the loose ends we've seen in the first 5 films. And it does. By seeing this film, it shows that the entire saga is really about Anakin Skywalker and his ultimate redemption in this film. Even though there are some repetitious elements (a second Death Star?), times of tired acting (Harrison Ford is really given very little to do in this film - and even he shows it when he is leaning against an Endor tree BORED waiting for Luke and Leia to return from their speedbiker chase), and introduction of the appalling cute factor (Ewoks, Ewoks, Ewoks!), there are also ingenious new additions like Jabba the Hutt and the Emperor we'll come to know in the prequel films.

For direction, Lucas again decided to cast another director to lead the final part of his series. Having directed only short films and TV series and having the only most relevant feature the good O Buraco da Agulha (1981), Richard Marquand is the one who takes on the responsibility of closing the initial trilogy with a flourish.

212,9.0,"Star Wars: Episode 6- Return of the Jedi (1983): Dir: Richard Marquand / Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse: Triumphant conclusion to a great trilogy. It is about the recuperation of the Rebel force and their retaliation again Imperial forces. It opens with the search and rescue of Han Solo whose frozen body is held within the lair of the ruthless Jabba the Hutt. This is a masterpiece of art direction and creature effects as Jabba's lair lays host to creatures of all distinctions. Luke Skywalker sets to complete his Jedi training with Yoda. The third act involves the Rebel Force gearing up for an attack on the Death Star. They are joined by a tribe of Ewoks in their battle. Visually spectacular without the cliffhanger of The Empire Strikes Back. Director Richard Marquand does a superb job at combining blazing action with humour. Mark Hamill as Luke is more focused and ready to face certain facts. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han are more certain of their feelings. Billy Dee Williams returns as a reformed Lando Calrissian and even leads the air battle when given opportunity to fly the Millennium Falcon. David Prowse again provides the physical presence of Vader whose corrupted soul is penetrated. It completes the trilogy but not without a victory that truly demonstrates good over evil. Score: 9 / 10",1
213,,"I, like most others, have found Return of the Jedi to be the weakest of the three original Star Wars films, albeit with wonderful strengths that mostly make up for the failings. Yes, the Ewoks are just too cute, yes Darth Vader was way too evil to be be accepted into the fold just because he comes around at the end, yes Jabba's palace scene, the monster in the pit aside, was hoaky. But, each time I see this film, two things strike me as so perfect that I forget about the rest of the movie, and it seems nobody else comments on these. First, I find John Williams music to be spectacular but somewhat derivative, but nowhere else does he shine as brightly as the background music during the scene when Luke finally goes nuts and almost kills Darth Vader. This is perfect wrought mood music (it is understated but is key to making this scene work). Second, Ian McDiarmid's performance here must be just about his best in any film, and I think certainly the best in this movie. (Ian who? He's the Emperor). A quick check of IMDB's actor list shows quite a few other movies in which I can now recall his character, such as in Dragonslayer, Gorky Park, etc; (all bit parts). But his scenes in Jedi seem to me a master stroke of really hitting the nail on the head. The postures, the movements, the facial movements behind the make-up, the voice, especially the small details of lip movement and little sneers. The eyes like a raptor's. None of this seems to be due to makeup. I can't imagine another actor who  would have done better in this role, and for me it makes the movie.",1

As always the acting, special effects, directing, editing, production design, etc., it's just all top notch, easy to say it is a well made film. There really isn't anything bad to say about this one, everything is just perfect like the other two in the original trilogy. A new addition to the Star Wars universe is the teddy bear-like creatures known as Ewoks, they add some great comedy and in the end help deliver a great message.

Return of the Jedi resolves Darth Vader's struggle to truly redeem himself in Luke's eyes, and the finale of the film (in the Death Star II) is an unbelievably potent ending to one of cinema's greatest characters. The Skywalker Family is probably one of the most traumatized families in cinema history: incest, orphaned as young ones, a force-sensitive-tyrant as a father who has destroyed millions/billions of lives, yet a family that is destined to bring balance to the galaxy.",1

There was obviously NO editing, as character development scenes were painfully long and pointless (although a good opportunity to make a cuppa!). The ""5 hot chicks"" were average, and if you're hoping for a bit of skin you'll be disappointed, as the best on offer is a passably attractive girl in skimpy shorts, fleeing for her life for about 10mins at most. The plot is barely existent, the filming dreadful, and there are simply not enough negative adjectives to describe this film. Did someone mention that this was made with ""just"" $35 million US? That would have to be the most destructive use of money since the ""eat a tapeworm to lose weight"" campaign in the 60's!

The ""Special Edition"" with added scenes and enhanced picture and sound add a bit of ""snap"" to the whole thing.

Even the Ewoks.<br /><br />However, after all these years, when I watch this film, I can't help but notice all kinds of flaws. The most glaring one is the confrontation between Vader and Luke. The premise of the confrontation is that the Emperor hopes to turn Luke to the 'dark side'. However, he never becomes tempted, which renders the whole thing pointless. Of course, there is the other plot line, namely the attempt by Luke to bring his father back, and that does provide some emotional payoff, but it doesn't save the film.<br /><br />The best part of ROTJ is actually its first act, in Jabba's palace. The plot becomes rather confusing and ridiculous here, but no one cares, because it's just too much fun to watch. The rest of the film is quite entertaining, though it never gets as original as it does in act one.",0

Everyone who wants to study film should see them, because they display quite accurately how not to make a movie, and in particular how not to write a script.

C'mon!), and obviously they wrecked the notion of film as anything but lightweight, even dull and stupid, entertainment.

I was wondering how this film would conclude the story arcs especially after how dark The Empire Strikes Back was. With Han Solo frozen in carbonite and the reveal of Darth Vader's lineage to Luke, I was very excited. Now I have seen this film many times since, but my thoughts remained the same. This is a very fun, satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy. While it does not reach the height of its predecessors, there are enough highlights to make this one memorable sci-fi adventure.",1

Sappy stuff with the Ewoks, overlong, new creatures not that fantastical (Jabba), an emphasis on the chase scene over the dramatic thrust, a bit of self-importance, and a touch of weariness - the actors look tired and bored, as if publicly greating each other is the way to get audience cheers. Carrie Fisher really needs to quit smoking - sounds like they have too many Marlboros on that planet.  Mark Hammill is starting to look, well, not-so-good.  Not bad overall, but a clear sign of decline - not as precipitous as the next installment, but the first crack in the Jedi's armor.",0
231,10.0,I liked this one a lot. I liked the scenes with Jabba at the beginning I thought he was a good bad whatever he is. The scene where Luke and the gang are in Endor is awesome with the biker scouts speeders. The ewoks were cool. The ending to the special edition to this is awesome too. Then you see Vadar with flames surrounding him. What a way to end this great trilogy. 5 ***** stars all the way and the best of the series at least to me.,1
232,6.0,"I'm not sure where it went wrong. Maybe Lucas just did not feel right about the middle one being dark, so he made this all warm and fuzzy. I didn't care for it, myself. Going by that this is about ten times further down the #250 list than the first two, I'm probably not alone in finding this a letdown. Of course, if the tone was all it was, this could still be great... but, alas, in neither case is that true. Marquand presumably also deserves portions of the blame. I don't know if he just can't do action, I haven't seen anything else by him. This just never actually engages, it certainly didn't, me. The light-saber stuff somehow never goes beyond ""dull"" and ""flat"". I know that it should, but it doesn't. The universe... honestly isn't that heavily expanded in this. A handful of new creatures, several of which are at least one of the following... irritating, more or less poorly realized visually and too cute. Designs aren't that imaginative, for a few. Places and ideas are revisited and redone. The sound comes off as not very unique. The score is still magnificent. Situations tend to be silly, their solutions, as well as how they come about. There are points of this where it seems like George forgot he wasn't writing a script for Indiana Jones. The effects don't particularly get better from the preceding entries(though, admittedly, some do). The pacing is reasonable, the film runs fairly smoothly. This doesn't have memorable or quotable lines. There is little of interest in the characters and their development is basically all in episodes IV and V. The DVD has a commentary track and it's worth a listen. I recommend this only to those who really must watch all of the Original Trilogy. 6/10",0

But if there is such a thing as guilt by association, then there also has to be undue credit by association, and I think Jedi has plenty of that.

With Empire Strikes Back being the best one, and I still gave it a three, I'd say this is the second best, and I gave it a one.  The acting is bad.  A movie like Pink Flamingos is good with bad acting, but a movie like this needs good actors.  The plot is thinner than that of Bloodsucking Freaks, and is completely unimaginative.  It's very boring, and the only good part is the musical number, which really wasn't there in the original.  Avoid this movie.",0

It ends the chronicles of the pivotal human characters in the series, mainly Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Darth Vader. It brings back other characters who seem either more or less than human, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Chewbacca, and the darling robots C-3PO and R2-D2. I wonder how fascinating it would've been for Chewy, 3PO and R2 to have arcs the way the humans did. After all, humans seem to be the minority in this galaxy: In this sixth and consummate episode in the Star Wars saga, we meet various inimitable characters, including the implacable Jabba the Hutt, who is like a goiter that was possessed with a life of its own and grew and took control as an evil leader of other strange beasts; the adorable, fuzzy Ewoks, the mammalian aborigines of the forest moon of Endor; a terrifying desert monster made of sand and teeth, and obnoxious little rodent creatures that hasten across the corners of the frame. And there is an admiral for the Alliance who's like a sapient dinosaur who began a career as a general and statesman. These are the most intriguing characters, to me, anyway, which is never more apparent to me in the original trilogy than in Jedi, with its overtly trite soap opera passages between Han, Luke and Leia that resemble General Hospital more than anything else.",1

Sure, this movie is repetitive in some scenes and maybe a tiny bit boring at times, but overall the movie still manages it very nicely. Luke learned so much in this movie, which was definitely noticeable. Darth Vader is more of a character in this movie. He is humanized and therefore, we get to relate to him a little.

People are still lining up whenever there's a new Star Wars movie on the horizon despite the fact that the last decent Star Wars movie released over 40 years ago.. Some people just never learn. As for this movie in specific, it falls under ""Mediocre"". It was nowhere near as good as it's predecessors and the only reason it's rated 8.3 is because of biased fanboys with clouded judgement. It had great music and cool visual effects but that's about it for the positives, same thing goes with any Star Wars movie made after this one.

Had they simply left them as an alien race that helped Luke and his friends they would have been fine but Hollywood and the licensing groups got together and turned them into something entirely unnecessary.

258,9.0,"This final film of the original trilogy may not be as popular or spectacular as the first two, but it is certainly still essential, from writer/creator George Lucas and director Richard Marquand. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the Empire, including loyal servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) preparing to welcome the Emperor to the new Death Star battle station, being rebuilt and more powerful than the last. Meanwhile, on the planet of Tatooine, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are representing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) by a message, and trying to convince Jabba the Hutt to release Han Solo from being frozen in carbonate, but he does not listen. Disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) does release Han, and Luke shows up, having to face a giant monster, but the eventually escape with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), and Leia strangles Jabba to death. Luke quickly returns to the Degobah system to see master Yoda (voiced and performed by The Muppets' Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) where he confirms Darth Vader is Luke's father, and he speaks of another Skywalker, before naturally dying. This other Ben (Obi-Won) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) says is Luke's sister, and he realises it's Leia. When they get back to the Rebels, they see the plan to destroy the shield generators of the new Death Star (from plans) by destroying the satellite on the planet Endor. Meanwhile, after a little rapid speed hover craft chase and meeting the cute and cuddly (for kids) Ewoks, Luke tells Leia of his revelation, before leaving to face Vader. He hands himself in to the Empire, and soon enough, Vader takes him to the psychopathic Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). As the battle between the Rebels and Empire goes on outside, and the Emperor convinces him of his friends being in danger, Luke eventually catches his light sabre to have a fight with Darth Vader, and release the Dark Side that the Emperor wants to see. Eventually, Han, Leia and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) knock out the satellite power, and Lando in the Millennium Falcon head for the centre of the Death Star. Luke ends the fight after cutting his father's hand off, and refuses to join the Dark Side, to which the Emperor starts electrocuting him with his Syth power. Darth Vader has a sudden change of heart though when he grabs the still electrocuting Emperor and tosses him off the edge. In his dying moments, he asks Luke to take his mask off so he can see him with his own eyes, and you see why he wheres the mask, and then he dies. Lando meanwhile reach the centre, blow it up, Luke gets away just in time, and the Death Star explodes. The ending has Darth Vader, or Anakin Skywalker rather, cremated, and everyone having fun at the concluding party, where Luke sees all three people that have helped him, the ghosts of Ben, Yoda, and of course, his father. Also starring Sebastian Shaw as Anakin Skywalker. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award (for visual effects), and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Sound.

Strong detail and a quick drive pushes the plot forward, hitting a bump when the Ewoks make their appearance. Han and Leia's mission's halted by the furry little creatures, spoiling what we want to see with what George Lucas wants us to see. The humans' story is sacrificed by the Ewok's screen time.

This is the film 2001 a space odyssey could have been. It surprises, it delights, it inspires. Highpoints to note: Sarlaac pit rescue (stolen by Hamill , using his thespian talents to give us the most convincing and devastating portrayal of a Jedi to date),the final scenes with Yoda( beautifully directed by Marquand; sensitive yet empowering),the climactic father and son confrontation (I dare anybody to say they didn't feel a chill go down their spine as Vadar hissed the word ` sister? '), Admiral Ackbar's scene-stealing charisma (surely the greatest performance ever given by an amphibian ), but it will surely be the Endor scenes which Lucas will be remembered for !!

The main story, dealing with the aftermath of Darth Vader's admission, should be the main focus rather than these silly subplots, and while most of film overall is good, the Jabba jam (complete with weird musical number) takes this down a point of no return that makes the film a bit eye rolling, especially the sight of Carrie Fisher in a dominatrix outfit and Pippi Longstocking braids.

I'm probably letting nostalgia get in the way, but the Ewoks never bothered me. I can see why people don't like them, and I know that the idea of teddy bears using bolas and sticks to defeat highly trained soldiers is ridiculous. But hey, at least it wasn't Jar Jar and I'll take the Ewoks over Jar-Jar any day of the week. All in all, I love Return of the Jedi just like I love the other two films in the trilogy.",0

296,7.0,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, and the Empire Strikes Back it's now time for Return Of The Jedi. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better and so is Return Of The Jedi but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1983 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the eighth movie of eleven in barely 72 hours for me, next one today will be the series The Mandalorian as I saw they recommend you to watch it between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens if you want to watch it in chronological order. I'm sure the quality will be even better as it's so more recent, looking forward to it.",1

The Emperor is so unfathomably twisted it's sick he's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West, the Evil Stepmother, and that kid from the Omen all rolled into one. But damn he's so cool. I guess that's why he's in every Star Wars movie except ""A New Hope"". Lucas probably had a field day dreaming him up. I still can't understand why he didn't make the top ten villain list he deserves a spot no doubt about it in my mind.

Not long after, I fell back to Earth somewhat wowed but considerably disappointed. Return of the Jedi is a solid end to the franchise, competent, alleviating, and without a doubt, intriguing, but simultaneously bland and underwhelming. To, yet again, quote Dante Hicks from the everlasting Clerks, ""all Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."" Of course, that's a vast oversimplification of what the film really features, but it's not an inaccurate statement. The last thing I ever expected to call a Star Wars picture is artificial-looking, but it must be said. Occasionally, the film will have points of sheer beauty and marvellous technology. Consider the briskly-paced sequence where Luke and Leia race through the forestry, evading a slew of enemies closely on their tale. Yet, frequently, much of the film looks like it was shot on the backlots of studios where the presence of a fully-designed set was dually noted. The mystifying qualities about space's contents and other-worldly galaxies seems to have been traded for modestly-interesting scenes, confined to solid land mimicking that of a forest preserve. It looks good. Not beautiful.",0

In many aspects, its status equals its chronological rank, but that doesn't say much. It is compared to masterpieces, it's nothing short of a masterpiece itself as far as sequels go, and it's still better than all the prequels put together. Still, I didn't like it at first.",1

306,6.0,"The last ""Star Wars"" sequel avoids some, but not all, of the pitfalls that the series had so deftly steered around before. Luke (Hamill) must rescue his friend Solo (Ford) & foil the Empire's latest diabolical plot while facing down the demons in his own heritage. ""Return"" undermines one of the great strengths of the series--the excellence of its villains-- by introducing not one but TWO new ubervillains. One is the Emperor himself (McDiarmid), an arthritic, dermatoligically challenged fugitive from ""Kung Fu,"" while the other, wholly unrelated badguy is the giant, sexually depraved worm (yes, really a worm) Jabba the Hut. After slowly building a tough damsel-in-distress under her enveloping costumes in the first two films, Carrie Fisher is reduced to a harem-girl plaything for the huge, slimy puppet Jabba, which has to be some kind of record-setting low for an actress. Hamill, though talented, doesn't have the presence to be an epic hero while Ford is mostly reduced to comic relief. Much of the film is taken up by events on the planet Endor, a Disney Adventureland inhabited by teddy bears. Except for the rousing theme carried over from the earlier films, John Williams's music is heavy & ponderous to the point of parody. Still, ""Star Wars"" is about spectacular, heroic action & ""Return"" delivers, with the opening battle on Tattooine & the climactic space fleet action making up for the mushy molasses of Endor. Billy Dee Williams helps take up any heroic slack left by Hamill & Ford. As with the rest of the series, ""Return"" isn't science fiction but outer-space fantasy adventure, so forgive any pretense of technological or social commentary. ""Return"" is aimed at devotees of the ""Star Wars"" but is still an enjoyable thrill ride for anyone.",1

A good conclusion to one of the most well know sagas of all time. I would probably have to give the entire Star Wars saga and even it's merchandise that I have enjoyed in life (video games, toys, etc.) a full five stars.

It's a very pleasing finale to one of the most renowned trilogies of all time, it ties up all the loose ends perfectly, while still being its own original story, having the majority of the film set on a planet that isn't seen or mentioned in the previous films was a clever move, and the Ewoks are a fun and lovable addition to the series. There's only two problems I have with the movie, one is that we never really see the main characters in too much danger, in the Empire Strikes Back the villains have the upper hand for the majority of the movie, but here it feels like Luke Skywalker always does, we never feel frightened or worried for him or his associates as it always seems that they have dominance over Vader, I also felt like the movie tried to be too cute with the Ewoks, with long shots of them silly running around and doing something adorable, I do like these characters but I felt like this was overdone at times and took away from the story too much. There are a lot of characters to follow in this franchise and it seemed like a tough job for any writer to have to wrap up all of their story arcs in just two hours, but hats off to George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, who did so here perfectly with the significant and even smaller characters, and also managed to never make it feel cluttered or rushed. Though it may not live up to its predecessors, Star Wars: Episode VI- Return of the Jedi is a great finale to a terrific trilogy, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure film or sci-fi.

Luke does appear to be well on his way to the dark side, dressed entirely in black and uses his force powers for much more than ""knowledge and defense"" when he slaughtered fifty or so people on Jabba's sail barge. The warm and fuzzy corniness of the Ewoks is balanced out with sometimes having a darker tone that was prevalent on Empire. The film looks fantastic and is probably the most action packed of the series with epic space and land battles and another excellent final lightsaber battle with Luke and Vader. Return Of The Jedi does have its flaws for sure, but it ties things up and is the last good Star Wars movie until Rogue One.",1

However, the special effects and make-up seem to be the only redeeming value of this particular chapter.

After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity.

Darth Vader isn't intimidating anymore, emperor pal patine is just a bad generic villain. actually the whole empire is just terrible now. Han Solo,Leia or Luke aren't even 1% as entertaining and interesting as they used to be, they are just boring. 2. the effects: the special effects used to be among the best in these star wars movies. in this one, they are the worst imaginable. this movie even uses some terrible CGI, though not a lot of it 3. the story: the story is completely boring and not much happens. the first 35 minutes is main characters running from the awful Jabba The Hut. then there is something about the empire making another death star (hmm where have i seen this before???) then they get to the Ewok planet, a bunch of teddy bears are able to defeat an army force of storm-troopers with laser guns (they are the most incompetent here) then the empire is defeated for good. though there is one good moment. it's near the end when Darth Vader is almost dead and he talks to Luke. this is a genuinely emotional moment. and then the movie ends with a musical number. way to ruin the only good moment in the movie. summary: complete crap. worst of the series. don't watch it... seriously",0

Star Wars is an every day phrase now, and it's hard to find someone who hasn't at least heard of it, and the force. Blending real life morals (I'm not getting into the theological side of Star Wars) with outer-world settings, with sweeping action and emotion Return of the Jedi provides exactly what this third installment needed, closure. If the other trilogies hadn't happened, these three films would be among the elites of all trilogies.

398,5.0,"I am baffled by the high ratings this film has received. It is actually quite weak, suffering from poor directing, a weak script with stupid (not corny) dialog and improbable situations. Enter the Ewoks, and the whole series ends in a blaze Toys-R-Us glory. The only story line of interest is the one pitting Luke against his father, but unfortunately Mark Hamill is not up to the task. The script calls for him to mourn the loss of Yoda, appeal to a (supposedly) conflicted Vader, fearlessly face the Emporer, be the matured, slightly aloof Jedi to his swashbuckling Solo and Calrisian, but until the very end, when Hamill finally pulls out all the stops, it is simply difficult to accept him as a mature jedi knight. The final fight between Luke, Vader and the Emporer is well-staged and beautifully shot. Unfortunately, one must traverse a lot of goofy material to get there, beginning with Jabba the Hut, who is wonderfully realized but his den of thieves and vagrants comes across more as a children's version of Ali Baba. The standout performance is Dave Prowse/James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, while Carrie Fisher is obviously looking forward to wrapping the series and getting on with her career, as it were. But enough. This film does not warrant deep analysis. A disappointing ending to what could have been one of the most compelling film series in historic. After 20+ years it still hurts.",0
399,9.0,"By 1983, the market had become so saturated with Star Wars and science fiction clones that programs were beginning to fail left and right. Even the mighty Doctor Who was faltering under the weight of its own canon, and new ideas had become thin on the ground. Many people criticise Return Of The Jedi as suffering from creative burnout, or Lucas getting too offended that the best film in his series has been the one he had the least amount of control over. There's a certain level of truth to this theory, but when you strip back the Hollywood politics and look at the story, you simply see Lucas being Lucas.",1

401,8.0,"Return of the Jedi has the conclusion of the trilogy's Skywalker and Darth Vader's redemption at its core, which nevertheless does not save it from being the weakest of the trilogy. In many moments, it seems to echo its previous instalments, but with a lesser sense of wonder and escapism that Star Wars first wowed audiences with, and which Empire improved upon. There is another intergalactic band entertaining at Jabba's palace, but although the design and costuming of the aliens is creative and often unique, the derivative jazz song is not nearly as memorable as the Cantina Band theme. In Tattoine we had endless deserts, twin suns, houses submerged blow ground to avoid the heat, sand creatures and scavengers roaming the cliffs...here we have a impressive looking sail barge and an imposing creature in the dirt, but it does not feel entirely otherworldly, and the conflict and threat (specifically the iconic Boba Fett) are quickly extinguished, and it does not feel nearly as engaging as the Battle on Hoth. I point to a different little moment that expresses the world of Star Wars more effectively; as Jabba's rancor beast is killed, its handler emerges and sobs at this personal loss, and this is something which we can all identify with, and speaks volumes of the depth of Lucas' universe.

If I was honest in my criticism, I'd give this probably a 3 star rating as it is a little bit weaker than the two before it. Also the narrative is a tad disjointed as the beginning is Luke trying to rescue Han Solo, then you get the final training montage, then the Ewoks and then finally the confrontation. All of this works reasonably well, but it feels like you need to have seen the first two to understand the full scale of what is happening. My point is, it's a great sequel, but not as strong as a stand alone. That said, who cares? This sequel is the most character driven and has a lot of heart. There are two tragic death scenes that are moving and an epic light saber showdown climax that probably features the best action sequences in the series. Again, I was not at all disappointed in 1983, and like the others took my wife to rerelease in the 90s, because, sure I loved The Terminator, Rambo and Bruce Lee, but Star Wars was and always will be the cornerstone of my childhood.",1

There's just one problem, which Yoda finally confirms: Vader IS Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker. It is here that the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi comes clean about Luke's dad, that O himself was very impressed with Anakin when he met him and arrogantly believed that he could train Anakin as well as Yoda. Big mistake. Luke doesn't want to fight Vader knowing that he's his father, but Obi-Wan tells him that saving Vader's soul is a lost cause: ""He's more machine now, than man. Twisted and evil.""

I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.",1
408,9.0,"Now this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is a little bit better than A New Hope. A New Hope was a very good movie, but something felt missing there. The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece, and this one is also very good, but flawed. I think almost everyone agrees that the main problem here are the Ewoks, like I do. They are cute little fellas and everything, but they just don't fit into this movie and makes the story too light- hearted while it's actually pretty serious and it is shown in parts with Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and I think that part is a bit underused. Seriousness is what this movie lacks. Not to be completely dark and serious, but more like the previous movie, and the Ewoks don't help. And it's also laughable how easily can Stormtroopers be killed. I mean, like, Ewoks beat them down in a few seconds. What??? Luckily, those were the only bad sides here. Humor works really good for the most of the time, especially with C-3PO and R2-D2. I love them. The action is well done as always and while there are many goofy and light-hearted parts of the movie, it has some very serious parts which I mentioned above that are really well done. Luke Skywalker has really developed as a character and now he's one of the coolest characters in the franchise. Here we also get to see a more human side of Darth Vader and he has never felt so vulnerable, especially with the arrival of the new big bad:The Emperor. The actor who is playing him (I can't remember the name, I'm really sorry) was so awesome. Just the way he moves, the way he speaks, his face expressions, everything was just great and just enough not to be goofy and that's one of the best performances in the series. Overall, this is a satisfying fast-paced finale of the original trilogy, and while not as good ad it's predecessor, and considered by many people to be the weakest in the original trilogy is still a great movie and one more timeless classic.",1

Unfortunately, dialogue is on and off, with truly meaningful moments becoming slightly overshadowed by forced and questionable lines. Character development is still bright, though, in particular for the lead protagonist and antagonist. Their overall trilogy arcs are undoubtedly satisfying. However, the plot is too inconsistent in its deliverance. The comedic moments of the film are simply not well done, even though relief is welcome for a film dealing in such a high stake conflict. This ultimately takes away from the legitimacy of the film's intense storyline, especially within the finale featuring some unconvincing action. However, the presence of three simultaneous third act plot lines is pulled off, particularly because of the well crafted main storyline. The supporting space piece is visually appreciable, too, even though it does feel repetitive of a past sequence in the trilogy, for obvious reasons.

In a nutshell, ROTJ has all the usual bad elements in a sequel and none of the good (aside from improved special effects). How anyone can mention this film in the same breath as the first two is beyond me or anyone who has any objectivity about this trilogy. The two biggest problems were the acting and story/script. The acting seems wooden and emotionless, Ford seems like he doesn't want to be there at all, Luke is monotone and boring, Leia looks and sounds worn out. I felt Lando and the Emperor did a good job (they seemed actually part of the movie). The script for everyone was repetitive, unoriginal, no comic relief or wit, and far less intelligent- and if fans can't see this, then as I said, they are simply unable to perceive/observe these details- not everyone can. Story line- poor. Half the film takes place rescuing Han, and while I enjoyed the segment concept, it was hugely overlong, and irrelevant to the main theme. The story and backdrops were also terribly unoriginal and repetitive. We spend half the movie on Tatooine (like the First film) and then half the movie in a very standard earth-like forest like Yavin (first film). The return of the same death star threat also, while not terrible, worsened the banality as did its demise by blowing it up similarly like the first film- yawn. Chronology was also hugely erroneous- In Empires, Lando & Chewie leave to go to Jabba's to rescue Han. Yet, Luke is somehow a virtual Jedi in a matter of days or weeks. I thought it takes years to become a Jedi- and who would have trained Luke since he returns to Yoda to ""continue the training"" after confronting Vader. This anachronism makes the audience feel like Lucas thinks we are stupid (maybe we are). Now, the biggest flaws of the film are the detail errors (from beginning to end): why did Jabba permit Leia to unfreeze Han when Jabba enjoyed him as a wall decoration? Why did Luke attempt to clumsily attack Jabba with a gun from the holster of a guard? Did he actually think he could single handed defeat all of Jabba's guards? How could Leia strangle Jabba with a chain? He's enormous and she's frail. With all of the forces of the Rebellion, why did they only rely on 4 of them to rescue Han from Jabba- risky, no? Why not send an army or have a larger force waiting outside once Luke and Lando infiltrate? And actually, why didn't Lando unfreeze Han since he was already under cover? Please. Why did they have a door closing panel on the 'inside' of the monster dungeon that Luke threw a rock at? Why would being ""digested for 1000 years"" be scary when you'd be dead in moments once swallowed? Why were the languages spoken at Jabba's so dumb sounding- ""wonga wonga""? Why does C3PO have so much trouble speaking a common Jabba dialect? For an interpreter of 6 million languages, he sounds like he is stumbling for the words all the time he speaks another language. Why are the creatures at Jabba's so juvenile looking? Absolutely stupid and silly compared to the sinister creatures in Star Wars. Speaking of which, the Ewoks really were silly- perhaps if they were not such a huge part of the movie! So, watching little people wearing teddy bear costumes for over an hour speaking in the least convincing dumb-sounding Ewok language was hard to bear, and listening to C3PO storytelling put me to sleep. Seeing Yoda on death's bed in ROTJ yet seeing him spry and jumping around like a teenager in Empires just shows how bad the errors in the timeline are in this film- and he just happens to die exactly when Luke arrives? Then the story line of Luke actually thinking he could 'turn' Vader just by approaching him and asking is completely delusional. What did Luke think was going to happen? Even a jedi would have a bit of trouble escaping alive from the Emperor and Vader on the Death Star. So why risk it as the last living Jedi??? Not plausible. Then let's fast forward to watching a Super Star destroyer (5 miles long) have a single fighter hit it and make it veer into the Death Star? Really? That's like a seagull hitting an aircraft carrier and sinking it. STUPID. Also, if you look at the scale of the Super Star Destroyer and the surface of the Death Star that it impacts on, the Death Star looks like it's a million times the mass of the Super Star Destroyer- not likely. And since when was it so close to the Death Star??? Wasn't it much, much farther away staying out of the conflict? What is most pointless is the fact that Luke could have avoided going to the Death Star and avoided Vader killing the Emperor and just watch as the Death Star gets ultimately blown up, killing but the Emperor. Redundant. Lastly, just because the Emperor is killed off, what about the thousands of Imperial ships and Destroyers, millions of storm troopers, and I'm sure plenty of high powered corrupt Senate officials and other bureaucrats who would obviously take over control? This movie ironically had literally all the movie making resources at its disposal. That may also ironically be exactly why this movie sucked- Lucas had way too much influence in it and not reigned in by smarter producers and co-writers and directors. Lucas may have succumbed to the hype of his own cult status and started to believe his infallibility and just couldn't imagine ROTJ could possibly end up being anything but amazing. He was wrong.",0

There's the explosive final battle against the evil Empire as well as the resolution of the more personal conflict between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. However, it's not quite a tour-de-force: there are some cumbersome info dumps, which slacken the film's pace, and the direction and photography are a little too simple.

The SFX, basically unchanged since the first film 6 years earlier, are by now beginning to pale in comparison to other films, yet somehow, they are still adequate for this one. This film also marked the end of our now-familiar characters, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia. Lucas sure left us hanging at the end of this one.

The most eventful film of the series; however, this installment rarely tops the die-hard fans' list. Still, an overall great film; its only real downfall is the numerous rushed conclusions to some very key characters.

Either more or less, it's still heavily balanced on plot and is backed by George Lucas' technical and imaginable wizardry.

429,7.0,"In the conclusion to the original trilogy Return of the Jedi in many ways did just that While it didn't receive quite the high praise that the empire strike back did. Return of the Jedi did manage to bring a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. It offers an emotional story while still Showing the Craftsmanship and Action that Star Wars Set the bar for a New Age of Sci-fi. In many ways the film does film more streamlined in the sense it doesn't have as many sets. The film does make up for that by having the Scenes stand out. Jabba's Palace with its more somber tone, reminiscences of the cantina in New hope. Endor with the final battle does manage to still mix a fair amount of action. It does have its problems one of the most notable being the Ewoks you either love or hate these things and it does fair of the film given how relevant they are to the final battle. It is a bit lazy for the goal to blow up the death star again. However, the action when it happens it still some of the most entertaining moments put to screen. Same with speeder bike on Endor with John Williams music accompanying it immerses you in this universe. The movie is without the funniest out of the three, and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. We know the situation at hand and the movie doesn't try to be any more than what it is to still be a fun-hearted adventure. You can tell everybody is having a blast even Harrison Ford.",1

Anyway, Return of the Jedi is definitely up to par with the first two (not counting Ep. 1). Though it may lack in a FEW places, it still is as great of a movie to have the words Star Wars in the title. My favorite parts are all the ones with Emperor Palpatine, the whole beginning involving Jabba the Hutt, and the fight scene at the end. I don't know why everyone hates the ewoks. They are a great touch to the Star Wars series. Besides, you need some charm in the final chapter in the series, just like you need some charm in the first chapter in the series (hint, hint: don't hate Jar Jar). ROTJ has classic moments in it, just like the others. Take the sarlacc for example, or the rancor. Those scenes have just as much in it for a true classic moment that the space slug did, or the sand people. All in all, ROTJ is the best climax to a series I've ever seen, and I'm glad that it had to be from the phenomenal part of culture called Star Wars.",1

The duel scenes between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is one of the most memorable and greatest fights I have ever see. The second Star Wars film is my favorite but this comes extremely close and I don't know it might just be tied with The Empire Strikes Back. The movie was just fantastic.

To me the worst is ""empire strikes back"" cause it's too much of a bridging movie having a loose start and end. Return of the jedi gives us the most spectacular images filmed on a truly epic scale with some classic moments in it. In the end, the series should be watched as a whole though and not as seperate movies but with this cast it couldn't have gone wrong anyway. Han Solo is simply the most enjoyable character ever to have appeared on the big screen and whenever Darth Vader is once again dispatching another one of his minions it remains ever so funny.",0

For the second time in a role, George Lucas returns as the film's screenwriter and producer, but turns the directorial duties over to another film-maker - this time Englishman Richard Marquand (who's most notable film up to that date had been 1978's lackluster THE LEGACY). While he lacks the thunderous cliffhanger charm and the somber literate quality that Lucas and Irvin Kershner respectively brought to the previous installments, Marquand proves to be quite proficient in the director's chair. Although the film doesn't re-imagine (or even revitalize) the genre the way the previous films did, it still proves to be a great space opera with plenty of highly memorable scenes and set pieces.",1

All of the major conflicts are resolved in this film once and for all, and regardless of how unlikely it is for the Ewoks to overcome the Empire, I find the final fight between Luke and Vader to be very invoking, and the final space battle to be very awesome.",1

I think that the original ""Star Wars"" has fared the worst through these re-edits, particularly the Mos Eisley scenes. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is left pretty much unscathed, with only a few changes made for continuity's sake. ""Return of the Jedi"" really only contains one change that I can't stand: the over-the-top inclusion of a CGI creature band in Jabba's palace. This fifteen second addition is just so out of place and weird. It doesn't really fit in at all with the rest of the scenes from Jabba's palace. I don't really mind the inclusion of planets introduced in the prequel movies to the ending.

Some of the feeling of adventure is sorely missing in this film whether it's the script, dialog, or performances or it could be those damn Ewoks!!!

He also learns from Obi-Wan the truth about what happened to his father and learns he has a twin sister.",1
472,7.0,"George Lucas did not have enough money to do Episode IV the way he wanted to and Episode V, despite a superior script suffered, a 10 percent drop in the box office.  So he used Episode VI as an excuse to do the special effects the way he wanted to do it.  Despite a promising beginning, Episode VI pretty much ended like Episode IV--the enhanced special effects added little to the ending.  Also it was disappointing because we saw the ""departure"" of another beloved Jedi--although with hind(fore)sight we see this was probably necessary to fulfill a prophecy from Episode I.",0
473,,"Coming out three years after the dramatic high that was ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Return of the Jedi"" had a lot to live up to.  Satisfactorily sorting out the various plot lines left dangling, as well as delivering a rousing conclusion to the series, was a tough test for the series' creators.  In spite of a much weaker script and some less than enthusiastic acting in some quarters, ""Return of the Jedi"" comes out on top featuring its fair share of enjoyable scenes, both fun and dark.",1
474,,"I can't understand how some people here don't like this movie. While I do agree that Empire is the best of the 3, this movie is great also. The only reason someone could dislike it is if they hate Ewoks, which I can understand. Unfortunately they didn't make it dark-toned like Empire and it does have a few other evident flaws, but nonetheless it is a very entertaining movie and is a fitting end to the trilogy. 9.5/10",1
475,2.0,"What a piece of crap. Thank you to the nther reviewers tha gave it four or less and explained well the film's short comings - I didn't want to admit that I had watched as much as I did.

476,10.0,"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is the third installment (or last depending on how you view the films release) and in my mind the second best. In this epic sci-fi film, the evil Empire finally falls and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally accepts the path of the Jedi.",1
477,8.0,"This for me was the weakest chapter of the original trilogy but it did what it set out to do. I have some friends who say it's their favorite; one of whom says he likes the space battle between the Rebels and the Empire. I used to like the space battle and used to watch those parts while fast-forwarding the other parts of the final battle while watching the movie. But now that I'm older I enjoy the lightsaber duels more. That for me is what Star Wars is truly about, and not just the space battles and the ground battles (like in Empire).",1
478,10.0,"It took me a while to notice it, but public opinion actually runs fairly strongly against this film. One main reason is quite plain to see-- the Ewoks! But come on-- admit it.

One it ties the story nice and clean, two the battles are awesome and three we see Luke becoming a full Jedi and he ,like the rest of his team, kicks ass. I think the main reason why is so looked down is the fact that is not as historic as the New Hope and Empire ,but it just ends with the story nicely. Where is the problem with that? It is at least twenty times better from Spiderman 3 or X-men the Last Stand ,which were the ends of their own trilogies, but we all know how bad and disappointing they were and everyone wants to forget them, where as the previous two are well loved by all. In other worlds no be just a great closing chapter to a landmark of a series is not a disappointment ,but a Herculean task. I have already recommended the previous two and I will do the same with that , it deserves more love.",1

485,6.0,"Following two really great and imaginative films, Return of the Jedi seems a bit like a letdown. Its not that its bad, I just feel slightly annoyed when I watch it. The story is understandably under pressure to live up to Episodes VI and V, but it doesn't really stand as tall. There are some good things though, so let's take a look.",1
486,7.0,"Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.",0
487,8.0,"I think most Star Wars fans agree that ""Return Of The Jedi"" could have been a better film. I think the marketing forces involved here had to broaden up the appeal of the film...to kids! Lucas tends to forget that, those of us who were 10 or 12 years old when we first saw the original Star Wars, were 16-18 years old by the time of Jedi. And I'm talking about the die hard fans; those of us that only like Star Wars films more as time passes by. For those fans, we would have liked a bit more depth of characters, a better dialoge. In this movie, Harrison Ford's part felt sort of cut down as was Carrie Fisher's. The Ewoks were ok, but many fans felt they were both: comic relief and a marketing ploy for future toys. Although I've read many comments complaining how Luke's character was never explored fully emotionally, many people tend to forget that Darth Vader also went through some second thoughts of his own, and those feelings could have been explored a bit more towards the end. The final confrontation was good and the complaints I have are mostly with the changing of actors. This would have been David Prowse' shining hour (He played the physical Vader; His voice was James Earl Jones'). Why this happened will always be open to debate. The effects, as always, pushed up the ante and laid the groundwork for contemporary effects. That said, ""Return"" is no let down by any means and should be viewed as a decent ending to a fabulous saga.",1
488,8.0,"Personally, I feel that there is not much difference from the previous two. The music and sound effects are good, the plot is simple, and the relationship between the characters is not complicated. The one that impressed me most was the caged beasts on Tatooine and the big mouth of the execution ground. His first appearance was quite shocking. There is also the indigenous people on Endo Star, the panda's body shape, brown fur, so cute. Indigenous traps and jungle terrain also made the imperial soldiers lose more reasonable. And Leia, the dress when she was enslaved by Jabba, feels a little bit of fun, but she is really sexy.",1
489,,"Luke Skywalker. The ultimate role model for children. Brave, caring towards his family and friends and most important of all, pure of heart. A great role model for children to follow as they establish their heroes in the movies.",1
490,10.0,"Many like Empire Strikes Back, they are all good but this is my favourite.",0
491,6.0,"This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.",0
492,9.0,"I think this movie lacked, compared to Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The main reason: the Ewoks. Sorry, but I really don't care for furry little rates in a Star Wars series, with the exception of Chewbacca. They just made the movie short on action. We had to watch them worship C-3PO and watch them throw rocks at storm troopers. The rest of the movie was cool. The chase on the speeders in the forest. The sand-pit with Jabba. The final battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The destruction of the new Death Star. Those parts were cool. Forget everything else. Buy the Special Edition and look at the added stuff. It's worth it. Not bad for a third movie in a trilogy. Most of them suck. Return of the Jedi: B+",0

494,8.0,"This film probably had more expectation than Empire did leading off from Star Wars, because sequels were never very good. So when Empire was an even bigger hit than the original film, Return of the Jedi had a lot riding on it to bring a thrilling ending to the trilogy. Did it deliver, in my personal opinion yes and no.

497,9.0,"I did not go to the cinema much as a kid. My family was not really the going out type. I do remember though the excitement of going to see ROTJ at the cinema with my family. It was amazing and still is. Great great moments, Jabbas palace and barge rescue, Boba Fett, the attack on the DeathStar, Speeder Bikes, Leia and Luke, Leia and Han, Ewoks, the battle of Endor and of course Luke V Vader and Vaders redemption. Loved it and still do. So much fun and so different to the recent trilogy which seems to take itself so seriously. Just for info, my dad bought me a toy LightSaber after, Green. It did not last long but I remember pretending to be Luke as a kid. Pure nostalgia.",1
498,8.0,"Return of the Jedi is definitely the weakest movie of the original trilogy. That's not saying it was bad movie, it's not by any means, it's just bad compared to the first two films, which...how could it not be, those films are near-perfect. It was a fitting and satisfying end though, which resolved Darth Vader's story in a very nice and warm way.",0
499,7.0,"Star Wars #6 rounds out the story. Jabba the Hutt joins the cast. I thought Return of the Jedi was better than The Empire Strikes back. Luke, Leia and company are faced with having to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt who has encased him in carbonite. I can hardly think of a worse situation to be in. Luke battles his father, Darth Vader. In 1977, Darth Vader was the epitome of evil, the devil himself. We accepted Luke, Leia and Han Solo as the focus of the story. As the story progressed, we see that the story is really about Anakin, that Vader is really a nice guy who made some bad choices. I had a problem with this. I think Anakin/Vader's redemption took something away. I also fail to see where John Williams' music is special.",0
500,9.0,"Return of the Jedi could've easily become one of the greatest ends to such a great saga if it weren't for the Ewoks. Seriously? This slowly begun the downfall of George Lucas. I know that Yoda said in ESB, ""size matters not"" but here its not just the size, its the weapons they possess. The idea of stormtroopers getting whopped by Ewoks is just totally unbelievable. It doesn't make much sense. ",0
501,10.0,"Im tired of hearing people say ""Oh yeah,Jedi is the weakest of the trilogy,nowhere near as good as the first two"" I think people have been brainwashed by the media and so called film experts around the world. Return Of The Jedi is the joyous conclusion the original Star Wars trilogy deserved.Sue it has Ewoks,but come on guys,they weren't that bad.People are always banging on about how the Ewoks single handedly took down the mighty Empire but if you actually consider what happens all the little fur balls actually managed to do was to create a diversion so Han Solo and co can get the upper hand on the forest moon allowing the real battle to ensue in space.The Vader/Luke/Emperor face off is also incredibly powerful,i think people have seen it that many times they have just got teddy bear tunnel vision and forget what really makes the film tick.I say Return Of The Jedi is a fitting finale to cinemas best loved trilogy,it complements Empire beautifully and sees our heroes united and victorious.10/10",1
502,6.0,"ROTJ is the is the final movie in the original trilogy. Personally, I consider this one to be the weakest in the trilogy, but that does not mean it is a bad film. Bear in mind that the previous two movies in the trilogy are both considered to be the best in all of Star Wars. To top them would be quite a feat, and this movie does not quite manage do it.",0
503,10.0,"I fluctuate between a nine and ten for this classic film. I liked the Star Wars movies more back in the 70's and 80's, so it might just be my tastes. However, Jedi remains my favorite.",1
504,8.0,"Return of the Jedi has a number of difficult responsibilities. It has to wrap up what was, at the time, the most impressive trilogy of films in the history of cinema. It had to follow Empire Strikes Back. All loose ends had to be tied, and be a cathartic conclusion. What's impressive is that it handles such mammoth tasks admirably, and is for the most part let down only by odd choices and vast ambition.",1
505,8.0,"I've finally come to the finale of the original trilogy, and although I still can't say I'm a huge fan of the franchise, I've really enjoyed all three of the original Star Wars films, even if there are glaring flaws that no one seems to talk about. Of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi definitely has the most noticeable problems, but it does end the series in a suitably ambitious and entertaining fashion. In Return of the Jedi, the Galactic Empire is building a second Death Star to finally destroy the Rebel Alliance, and Emperor Palpatine is personally overseeing the project. The Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack onto the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill Palpatine. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker attempts to bring Darth Vader out of the Dark Side of the Force. The action scenes in Episode VI are a bit more inconsistent than in the other movies, but I have to mention the speeder bike chase scenes. It's without a doubt my favorite scene in the series so far because it's so fast-paced, well shot and intense. It was definitely the highlight of the movie. One of the weaker action scenes was a bizarre set piece with the Ewoks. The entire scene was just awkward; I find it hard to believe that a primitive race of small hairy creatures armed with sticks could defeat the Imperial stormtroopers. Return of the Jedi also didn't improve on the cheesy father-son plot from The Empire Strikes Back. Watching Luke pitifully try to convince Darth Vader to step away from the Dark Side was groan-inducing. Nevertheless, the strengths of the Star Wars series are still on full display here. The utter imagination and detail put into the universe is incredible, and the film is just as exciting as its predecessors. Return of the Jedi isn't as competent as the previous films, but it is a satisfying and sporadically rousing conclusion.",1
506,9.0,"The first two films were enthralling; would the third carry it out? While not as powerful as the first two, Return of the Jedi does not fail to entertain. The film is imaginative just like all the other Star Wars films with enough new special effects to hold our eyes on the screen. The plot makes sense and delivers the same fun punch as the previous films. Seeing the characters evolve over the three films is a pleasure and the trilogy ends nicely here, we feel resolved by the film's happy energy, which is the best way to end a saga. In chorus with its predecessors, it remains a strong piece of storytelling and special effects.",1
507,8.0,"This is definitely one of my favorites! While not like Empire Strikes Back it's still great! The Emperor is shown in person and even though he is a frail old man he is also very dangerous! Darth Vader also is really good as he is more emotional as he struggles between dark and light! This is the second great one after Empire Strikes Back! It's far from the best though as there are so many other Star Wars movies like ""Rogue One""! It is still very memorable and I love the Ewoks !",1
508,7.0,"Indeed, it is technically a great innovation in the history of film... To achieve such a level of special effects under such brief conditions at the time was truly astonishing. But as far as the plot is concerned, the first three films are not very good models. Of course, there are a lot of things that can't be achieved because of the special effects, but the details of what a lightsaber will do when it is used to cut (hammer) are really hard to grasp.",1
509,8.0,"i agree that this episode may be the weakest for true SW fans, but i still consider it the most enjoyable one. It's the only one that really never gets boring, while the other ones were. It's the only one that has a really good, emotional sword fight. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was again a Death Star to destroy, and the Ewoks were indeed annoying. The special effects are definitely improved, and the very last scene on Endor was very well made and it gave you that heart warming feeling that everything turned out ok.",1
510,8.0,"RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) features the same old cast as the first two STAR WARS episodes in a rehash of previous themes. Now with a cast this talented and material this strong, rehashing is not necessarily bad. This time the Galactic Empire's forces lead by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse acting with James Earl Jones's voice) has again build a Death Star and is still out to destroy the Rebel Alliance. This Death Star is, of course, even more powerful than the previous one and has the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) personally supervising its construction.",1
511,8.0,"the last episode of the star wars saga is the most spectacular and most enjoyable of the series. True, it's not as inventive or as original as the first two films, but the STAR WARS was just too hokey and hard to enjoy when you watch it today, and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was way too dark and sometimes even boring. This one has the best action and leaves you with a satisfied feeling unlike EMPIRE. This is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, and extremely enjoyable to watch.",1
512,9.0,I gotta admit I never grew up when Star Wars first came out but It has not changed how much I love this Saga. This episode is one of my favourites. I love the ending but do not prefer the beginning. I wish this had the beginning of episode 4 and had this ending. It is a great introduction to jabba the hut and is an awesome sequel Although not a better one to episode 5 the empire strikes back. Honestly many people hate the ewoks but they are cute and deadly. It Is stupid how they do kill storm troopers by throwing stones and arrows. Seriously consider how stupid and useless their armour is I don't believe stormtroopers are useless because they kill many Rebels and took over the ship at the beginning of episode 4.,1
513,,"Many millions of people love Star Wars, and I am not going to hide the fact, that I am part of that trend. In my opinion, Star Wars (Episodes 4-6) make the greatest movie trilogy of all time. In Episode 6, Return of the Jedi, we see the gripping conclusion to the ultimate movie joyride. So strap yourself in for the ride of your life!",1
514,,"The last and best of the trilogy. Luke and Leia have really matured in this one. It also has great scenary. Luke learns the truth about Darth Vader, and is told that he must face Darth Vader again, in order to become a jedi. Han Solo, Leia and crew go to a forest planet to knock down a shield that is for a new death star, that Lando Carrission and his crew must destroy. I was 7 years old when this movie came out, and it was a great memory for me. I really enjoyed this movie. Another great sci-fi classic.",1
515,8.0,"Liked this movie but it lacked the class of the previous two episodes. The Tatooine rescue was well executed but a wee predictable. I liked the scenes between Luke and Yoda. The way Yoda evades the questions that Luke asks him was well written. The Ewoks were a mistake though. Furballs are Spielberg's department... But the battle in space above Endor was superb and Anakin fulfilling the Chosen One's destiny and completing the legacy of being the one to destroy the Sith was perfectly in line with the story started in the prequels. Was a little taken aback by the 'Skywalker family connection' but the prequels have tied this all up. The celebrations at the end were superb. Listen closely for a Gungan shouting 'Wesa Free!', a brilliant tie to the prequels. The extended Rebel celebrations were brilliant too, and we get to see Luke and Wedge, Lucas's token survivor through the entire trilogy, shaking hands and then embracing, completing the circle from episode IV. In all honesty though, the trilogy went out on a brilliant note and the legacy started had been fulfilled, and Anakin's story came to an end who was what the story was really all about",1

517,10.0,"I newer was a ""true"" fan of Star Wars though I liked these movies. But today by watching Return of the Jedi again, I noticed how addictive this film really is. Not like in Empire Strikes Back, in this film Dart Vader looks kinda weak, but that wasn't disappointing to me because I really started to care about characters and what's going on to them, so by watching this film, I kinda felt sorry for Darth Vader. Jabba was also different this time, it looked kinda dangerous and was an unlikable character, though in The New Hope he looked like a better person. This movie has a lot of action, much more than previous two parts, and it looks much better.",0
518,10.0,"Why is this installment so underrated now?  When it first came out, a lot of fans (including Lucas' pal Spielberg himself) thought that it was actually the best of the trilogy and was just more satisfying than TESB.  It certainly did NOT disappoint fans, and even made a serious run at toppling E.T. as the all-time #1 box office champion at the time. ",1

520,10.0,"I don't understand why when I ask people to rank their favorite Star Wars films, this one is constantly at the bottom? Is it because of the Ewoks? Because other than people having gripes with them I can't see many flaws. The story is great as always, the fights amazing, the effects outstanding, the interactions between characters are top notch, and it wraps up the trilogy really well. One of my favorite Star Wars films and really underrated.",1

522,6.0,"The third film of the series unfortunately had less magic in it when compared to A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. For instance, there was an obvious drop on both character expression and development along with a huge increase of special effects. The film was more of show than soul most of the time. However, I could not think of a better way for the story to go and maintain the soul The Empire Strikes Back formulated before this film. George Lucas did his best and I accept that. Among the best things I liked here was the Emperor's presence (he is VERY evil), Darth Vader presence until the end, the Ewoks and the special effects. Return of the Jedi's a great film overall, though a step lower from Empire.",1
523,8.0,"Newcomers and Fans alike often misjudge or overlook Return of the Jedi as being the weaker film of the original trilogy. And usually for very trivial reasons. However, I have reason to believe that this film has become criminally underrated. ",0
524,7.0,"While it nowhere near as good or thrilling, heart touching, and memorable as the first two in the trilogy, return of the Jedi is still a good movie, even if it is a disappointment, I honestly thought that this was a great ending to not only the trilogy, but to the saga, I appreciate this movies dark tone, so how do you make it as good as the first two? This is how",1
525,10.0,I think the movie is just as great as the empire strikes back and Star Wars. People complain about ewoks but there were also rebels fighting the empire and chewie stole an AT-ST so then the rebels and ewoks became stronger. And further it has the greatest space battle of all time. And the music is still great. And the ending is very satisfying and touching.,1
526,6.0,"Episode VI is the worst sequel/prequel of the Star Wars-Episode IV movie. I enjoyed the first 40 minutes, but the rest is bad and boring. It is not a good ending of the Star Wars - Trilogy, but it is not that bad either. I rated it a 6(.5)/10.",0
527,1.0,I recently watched this movie as I was given the first 3 star wars on DVD it was like watching one big puppet show from jabba the hut to the ewoks the only bit I liked was the speed chase threw the woods other then that the movie was meh but as i said it's probably down to a age thing.,0
528,8.0,"The final chapter of the Star Wars saga, Return of the Jedi has a difficult job: wrap up most story lines, produce one final epic battle sequence, and go much deeper into the mythology that is the force. The movie accomplishes each of those tasks fine, and though unfair, when comparing ""Jedi"" versus the other two films, it's the weakest. That's not to say it's a poor film, to the contrary it is still most entertaining, but the slow pace to the beginning of the movie takes away from the high energy that ""Empire Strikes Back"" ends on. If you'll recall, at the end of ""Empire,"" our heroes Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the droids are searching for Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who is being held by the gangster Jabba the Hutt. That's the warm up to the movie, the story line continuing Luke and Darth Vader is much more interesting and leads to the ultimate end of the movie and saga. One of my favorite scenes in all of movies comes at the end of ""Jedi,"" the final battle between Luke and Darth Vader, long-shots, big music, sends chills up my spine. The movie was intended to be directed by George Lucas' friend Steven Spielberg, but a union technicality nixed that idea, and little known Welsh-born director Richard Marquand does the job. We also get to see the sinister Emporer, played by Ian McDiarmid under layers and layers of makeup, he adds another piece to the force puzzle. Then there are the ewoks, those cute little made-for-merchandising furry creatures that occupy the middle of the movie. They're cute, but after the dark, adult themes of ""Empire,"" the ewoks evokes a kiddy charm that takes away from the maturity level of the Star Wars movies. I would have liked to see a planet of wookies over a planet of ewoks, but what do I know? A movie of power scenes, with silly ewoks in the middle, Return of the Jedi is a satisfactory and entertaining end to the Star Wars saga.",1

Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised though, after all George Lucas is a GREAT FILMMAKER, and this was GREAT. The first comes about 2:02 into the movie, after the fireworks on the forest moon, when you see the crowds gathering at Coruscant to rejoice that the Emperor is dead and the evil Empire is dissolved. You can clearly hear: Wesa Free! (and if you use subtitles, you'll see it too!) which shows us that JarJar Binks is still alive and kicking! Fun! What's he gonna do in Episode 7...",1

536,7.0,"When it comes to Star Wars, the original trilogy reigns supreme. That being said, ""Return of the Jedi"" can be seen as an anticlimactic ending to the George Lucas' initial saga.

538,7.0,"While ROTJ is not as good as Star Wars and The Empire strikes back it is however still very enjoyable. It does though in my opinion feel like a lesser remake of the original, but with the added bonus of a fantastic light sabre battle between Luke and his father Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker. This film is heavily centred on Luke so my favourite characer Han Solo seems to fade into the background, stuck in a rediculous battle with the Ewoks on Endor, including I kid you not a ""Tarzan yell"" from Chewbacca! how did that get in there? Still this is Star Wars after all so there is more plus points than minuses, the plus points include a great space battle and an amazing speedbike chase. Also the emperor makes a great baddie, but the unmasking of Darth Vader was a mistake and I hate the way they got rid of Boba Fett. To be hones The Empire Strikes Back was always going to be hard to top and they couldn't quite pull it off ***7/10**",1
539,,"As a kid I watched Jedi the most out of the trilogy and always enjoyed it. The Star Wars films are extremely entertaining and are a fun series of films. I enjoy Jedi and can get past the fact that the Ewoks are cutesy overdone creatures. In this episode the robotic duo goes to Jabba the Hutt's palace and attempts to get Han Solo in his carbon frozen state. Leia is hot in this. I always thought she was very hot in her golden bikini. Once Han is rescued they get briefed on a mission to shut down the shield generator for the second Death Star. Luke must comfront the evil Darth Vader and he faces Vader and the Emperor. The Emperor was always a fave character of mine and after seeing Phantom Menace, I enjoy his role in this better. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and the droids go to the planet Endor which is a huge forest with small furry primitives. The Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are awesome. This has it's weak lines and Solo is almost a different character but overall it is effective. I'm not about to place the order of quality in the Star Wars series but Return of the Jedi is a great ending for a trilogy. ****",1

541,9.0,"Star Wars Return of the Jedi is the final film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It sums up the series and ties loose ends from the previous two movies. In the final movie of the trilogy we see George Lucas introduce an abundance of new characters throughout the film, such as the monster underneath Jabba the Hutt's lair, the kraken type sand monster, and the Ewoks.<br /><br />In this final film of the trilogy we see the final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth vader. This battle was inevitable and everybody who had seen the two previous movies would know that this scene was coming. The way that Lucas decided to do this was wonderful and at the end of all of it he reveals the true face of Darth Vader and proves Luke's point earlier in the movie that his father still had good left in him. Throughout the entire film I was just thinking about what could happen next and it kept me locked in the whole time. Lucas found a perfect way to execute the plot of the film and by doing this it made the film that much better for the die hard Star Wars fans. The way that every scene was well thought out and led up to the ending of the film was perfection.<br /><br />A key scene leading up to the end of the movie was when Luke went to go visit Yoda before he passed on. In this scene Luke gets closure about who his father is and who his sister is. This is one of the scenes from the film that ties loose ends from the previous two movies.<br /><br />One negative thing I found within the film was that Yoda and Obi Wan Kinobi didn't have bigger roles. I was disappointed by this because of their roles in the previous two movies. In the eyes of die hard Star Wars fan this was seen as a little bit disrespectful and I was very disappointed by this.<br /><br />The plot of the film leads up perfectly to the defeat of the emperor. It starts with Luke rescuing Princess Leia and Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt and then they go on too the planet where the death star power station where they meet the Ewok's and are nearly roasted to death by them. After this it's an uphill battle against the emperor and the dark side which is very entertaining and the battle scenes are very well played out, such as the battle between Luke and Vader. This scene was beautifully done and the different stages of the battle are amazing. The way that Lucas keeps the battle going and the dialogue throughout is special. It was the perfect way to end the ongoing battle between Vader and Luke. In the previous movie we see Luke have his arm chopped off by his father and he Doesn't end up getting killed by Vader. He had an opportunity to end it all their but since his father still had good in him he didn't. This is where Luke finds out that his father still has good in him and that's why he tries to pursue this relationship with his father because he knows with Vader on his side he will be able to defeat the emperor.<br /><br />The scenery of the different planets throughout the movie is Beautiful and so well thought out by Lucas. It was as if he had visions of where the scene should be held and they were perfect. Another part of the movie that was executed very well was the music. Without music this movie would be terrible. The effect that music adds is incredible. Every fight seen when something is getting intense or it looks like the battle scene is going a different way the music help portray this.<br /><br />In conclusion the movie Star Wars: Return of the Jedi was very well executed and was a perfect ending to one of the best trilogies known to humans. The plot sums up the ending perfectly while still maintaining the interesting battles and and cameos to characters throughout the movie.",1
542,7.0,"Though disputably inferior to episodes iv and v ""Jedi"" makes for a fantastic finish to the trilogy and sends chills down your spine. It is, unfortunately, rather predictable from about half-way through, and I must say it was almost disappointing to see Vader's conclusion. Though cute and cuddly those ewoks just don't add believability nor remain in consistency with the tone set from episode iv. (They do however add appeal to females thus broadening the viewer spectrum.) What more can be said than that the action, special effects and general story can nor has been equalled by any sci-fi film in history. Lucas is sure to go down in history as one of the greatest sci-fi/fantasy writer of all time.",1

544,7.0,"While by far and away the weakest film in the first trilogy it has some things going for it. The opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt were very well played.The scenes are intense and gripping,Michael Carter's cameo as Bib Fortuna is a delight,and sorry anyone not pleased by the site of Carrie Fisher in the Slave costume must be embalmed. Its not the only reason to watch Fisher though, her performance in those scenes is very ,very, good. its a shame that she,along with Harrison Ford are barely utilized for the remainder of the film ! Ian McDiarmid is a joy to watch as Palpatine, this expert actor from London's Almedia Theatre is one of the finest additions to the Star Wars universe.

545,10.0,"Star Wars Episode 6 is the third feature film to be released on December 12, 1983. However, it is chronologically arranged the sixth part. It is a US American Space Opera movie, which means it takes place in a fictional universe. Famous actors are Carrie Fisher, who plays Lea in the movie. Unfortunately, the actress died early. Mark Hamill plays Luke Skylwalker and Hamson Ford is Han Solo. The Emperor is portrayed by Ian McDiarmind and Dawid Prowe plays Darth Vader. Other important figures are Yoda (Frank Oz), Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The production of the film suffers George Lucas.<br /><br />In the sixth part, Lea wants to free her friend Han Solo, who is imprisoned by Jabba de Hut (a comic creature). But her rescue mission fails and she becomes a slave herself. Lea's twin brother Luke Skywalker, who is Jedi Master, rescue them with the help of his droids R2D2 and C3PO. After that, Luke goes to Yoda (his master) and learns that he is finished with his training. He's only supposed to face Darth Vader, who's Luke's father. Yoda then dies of old age. The plan now is to destroy the second Death Star. Luke, Lea, Han Solo and their loyal friend Chewbaca set out to save the galaxy from evil. Luke has to face his father. The emperor's goal is to turn Luke to the dark side of force. Will he make it?<br /><br />Personally, I find the movie very exciting and action-packed. Despite the fact that the movie is ancient, the movie has a lot of good effects. The lightsaber fights are always fascinating again and again. I can only recommend the movie because it is a lot about friendship, love and also family. However, Star Wars is nothing for everyone, because the movies are very imaginative.<br /><br />All in all, Star Wars 6 is a fantasy movie with lots of action. The three friends Lea, Han and Luke want to save the universe and destroy the Death Star. I won't tell you whether they will succeed. Watch the movie and find out. May the force be with you!",1

It is obviously the weakest out of them, but that means pretty much nothing at all. Everything is still done great and the trilogy stands strong. A lot of people complained about the Ewoks, but I didn't mind that. I love all 3 Star Wars films. They all have groundbreaking effects, great acting, great atmosphere, great stories, great music, everything works. They will be known in cinema as one of if not the greatest trilogy in film history.

You would think that a kindergartener would get scared of all these aliens.  I wasn't!  The only thing that I was a little scared of was the Emporer (he certainly looks scary, doesn't he?). Another scary sight was seeing Darth Vader's face after Luke takes off his mask. We discover that Darth Vader's head looks like an egg.

Return of the jedi has some stupid scenes, just like the Jabba Hut scene, the chase between Luke, Leia and some weird clones and -of course- the horrible Ewoks. The Ewoks are what makes this film seem less important than The empire strikes back and more stupid. The way Ewoks destroy an entire squadron is just ridiculous. And even more considering that it is at the same time that we see the great battle with Luke. Has some great things, but some others are horrible. Sad way of finishing a good trilogy.",0

It's really just a gross feeling and un-entertaining part of the film. The rest doesn't feel so original or different enough from the first two movies. The Emperor was also a let down. It would've been a lot cooler to just have Darth Vader be the sole villain. But I do understand that they wanted to show Vader's sense of vulnerability throughout the movies in the sense that he wasn't the dominating force. And the whole trying to get Luke to turn to the dark side was very forced and could've been more developed.",0

It is technically superior to both A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, and features a full circle in the characterizations of Luke, Han and Leia, and most especially Darth Vader.

The fight scenes, acrobatics, visual effects and Princess Leia's outfits all step up their game in this last instalment of the original Star Wars saga. Little furry Eworks native to the moon of Endor steal the show as adorable little fuzzy teddy bear- like creatures that hilariously worship C-3PO and attempt to roast Han Solo & Luke on an open pit.

582,8.0,"While Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the original three Star Wars movies, but it still packs a good punch and closes out the best trilogy of motion picture history. It begins with C3PO and R2D2 visiting Jabba the Hutt. They find Captain Solo (Harrison Ford) still in carbonite. Chewabacca (Peter Mayhew) is captured, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who was incognito as a renegade bounty hunter. It is up to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to save the day. As a real Jedi, he is able to confound Jabba's men, destroy his barge, and rescue Leia, Han, Lando, and Chewie. The remaining two-thirds of the film deal with the final rebel assault against a new Death Star. Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the project with Darth Vader. As Luke and Han launch an attack to take out the defense shield from the moon of Endor, they meet some strange friends, the Ewoks. This leads to rollicking fun, great space battles, action sequences, awesome special effects, and Luke's temptation to join the dark side. I did have a few gripes with this movie. I know Lucas originally wanted to have the Ewok battle originally done with Wookies. I wished he would have stuck to that because the idea of stone-throwing teddy bears warring against storm troopers strained credibility. The only other strike was not introducing us to Emperor Palpatine sooner. He is only mentioned in the first Star Wars movie, and we do get a holographic image of him in the Empire Strikes Back ... but as the true master of evil he should have been brought in earlier. Nevertheless, Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie overthrow the Empire once and for all, restoring balance to the force and allowing good to triumph over evil. If only more movies could do that better.",1

The new Death Star is kind of disappointing. I wish they used their obviously incredible imaginations to come up with a better home base. Some of the coolest bad guys are defeated in stupid ways.

586,8.0,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi is a fantastic ending to a terrific opening trilogy. At the time that it was first released, that was all we thought that we were getting, no major book projects were in store for one of the highest grossing if not the highest grossing sci-fi movie franchises of all-time and while a couple cartoon spin-offs did make their way to Saturday morning cartoons that was going to be it for Star Wars fans. And what a way to go out, with a satisfying film that answered some of the most complex questions that the trilogy had brought up. First the question that was raised at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. While fighting Luke in Cloud City at the end of the second original film, Vader famously tells Luke that he is his father and in Return of the Jedi, after conferring with both Yoda and ghost Obi-Wan Kenobi we learn this line to be true. Of course when the prequels were added starting with 1999's The Phantom Menace, this became common knowledge but at the time back in the early 1980's this was ground breaking information and is still apart of the American lexicon today! Secondly we learn that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are actually brother and sister in the Star Wars universe!! Again leaning on that conversation with ghost Obi-Wan early in Return of the the Jedi, the now deceased Jedi Master spills the beans to Luke about his and Leia's true relationship and how they were split apart to protect them from the Emperor and Vader. Again, groundbreaking information at the time that strengthened the family aspect of the Star Wars films. Once again if you took this simply based on the prequels point of view, this would be common knowledge but was a shocker to the common movie goer back in 1983. Luke's green lightsaber was also something of a surprise as well back then too, so much so that some movie posters and hype magazines painted it blue originally to keep it a surprise to audiences. Another fun fact is the director of the film. Richard Marquand, friend of Star Wars creator George Lucas, admirably directed the film but Steven Spielberg was actually the first choice to do so. It turns out he could not because he was a member of the Director's Guild & Twentieth Century Fox - the company that financed the first three Star Wars films including Return of the Jedi - wasn't willing to pay the fees to have Spielberg direct the film at the time. The action in Return of the Jedi is great & with the addition of a couple lines for the digital copy (this is the one that I reviewed) you really see how two Jedi returned for this film!! In the end scene where Luke is brought to the Emperor, in the very final scene of that part where the Emperor is electrocuting Luke and VADER saves Luke by shouting ""No, no!!!!"" Then dumping the Emperor over a bottomless railing you see TWO Jedi emerge (well I guess one Jedi re-emerge in Anakin/Vader) to save the day and bring the lightsaber dueling part to a very satisfying conclusion!! There's lots of fun with the Ewoks, and great humor how the fury little bears worship C-3PO, who in every other story gets kicked around and is the butt of everybody's joke but is treated like a God in parts of this one. There's even a great coming together and celebration at the end of the film when the Evil Galactic Empire is finally defeated. It's a movie for the ages that has stood the test of time. 8 out of 10 stars!!",1

The protagonists that we know and love are also dealing with new problems and the antagonist is more lovable and three dimensional than before.The tone is lighter than the previous film,the plot has some problems (there is a big subplot about the second Death Star that is similar to the first Star Wars film) and it doesn't take risks so it feels less mature but it is still very enjoyable.It goes without saying that the practical effects are mind blowing and the music score by John Williams is iconic.The performances are good especially by Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones(fun fact: besides doing the voice for Darth Vader in all of the three films he was only credited in Return of the Jedi)In a nutshell,Return of the Jedi is a great film(rated #75 best film of all time by IMDb) with great characters,amazing visuals,incredible music and unforgivable moments that gives a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy despite being the worst in it(I don't say that it is a bad film I just say that it is not as good as the other two films in the trilogy).If you haven't seen it you really should but I am sure that you saw it a billion times.",1

This is the downward slide from a Fantasy Fiction (note not Science Fiction... Star Wars has absolutely no science in it) that adults could just about admit to liking... to something that would barely be green-lit as a children's movie today. The ending cranks up the action a bit, but it's all so poorly choreographed (more obvious on repeated viewings). Oh and the acting... and the dialogue. Pure cheese... and not in a good way.

I'm not really into huge space battles so I preferred that this was set mainly on Endor. I enjoyed the scenes in Jabba's palace too. The blue elephant musician is cool. Jabba himself is a delightful creation. Fortunately Yoda, who I found annoying in Empire, only has minimum involvement. There are humorous moments, romance & valour. The Ewoks have the right blend of cuteness & savagery. You can also watch them in ""Caravan of Courage"" & ""Battle for Endor"". The cartoon is good too. Most of the aliens are fun to view, although I was less than impressed with those accompanying Lando. Still rather them than the CGI overkill in ""Phantom Menace."" Sometimes simplicity works best. 9/10",1

And I made this film one of my favourites. But there's one thing I never understood. Why is it categorized as Sci-Fi? According to Isaac Asimov, there's two types of Sci Fi. The first one deals with science. And I would say the only real ""Science"" ""Fiction"" movies are Star Trek. And there's a lot of books- Jules Verne, Isaac Asimov himself. It has to do with science. The other type of SF Asimov meant is the one that deals with what could be in the future. There's a lot of these- Total Recall, Terminator, all these. It has nothing to do with science, but with future. But there's no future, there's no science with Star Wars. What is left is Fiction- the best there could be.",0

What makes this entry in the series is that it further builds the universe that the other 2 movies have built up and we can see that with the begining of this movie that it picks up straight after empire and Luke,Leia,Lando,Chewie,C3P0 and R2D2 are trying to save Han from Jabba the Hutt the ganster that had Han frozen in carbonite and that for me is really good as it doesn't jump straight away rom whats happend it builds on the story already built which is some perfect film maker.<br /><br />Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Billy Dee Williams,Harrison Ford,James Earl Jones,Anthony Daniels,Peter Maythew,Frank Oz,Alec Guinness and Kenny Baker return to reprise their roles and new to the cast was Ian Mcdiarmid who was the evil master of Vader and he was so spine chilling with his performance in this movie and he will always be one of my favorite parts of the movie.<br /><br />This one and all of the original trilogy will always resonate with me as growing up these would be the movies i watched it growing up and so when i saw the ewoks in Jedi it would make me happy and make me laugh and yet the serious moments would also be something i would remember and the moments between father and son between Vader and Luke for me have sticked with me and this one with all of it's twists and turns will always for me be one of the best moments of my life watching all these moments in not just Jedi but all of the orginal trilogy.",1

616,10.0,"This movie tied up everything in a very satisfying way. I appreciated that then and even more so now. Today's movies, including the Disney sequel trilogy, spend time building and subverting expectations and avoid entertaining, making you not care about the people in the movie, and trying to add too many twists and turns and surprises that are annoying and unnecessary. This movie had some surprises that add to the story but don't distract or take away from the story that came before. Every segment was fun and exciting: Jabba's palace, Luke and Darth and Emperor stuff, Hand and Leia on the moon of Endor, even Lando and Nein Num in the Falcon. I was interested and cared about all of it. And ending was so satisfying and happy yet still dramatic.",1
617,,"I'm an admitted Star Wars fanatic, and even though I've seen the trilogy in its entirely at least 20 times, I still thoroughly enjoy watching every film.  However, Return of the Jedi isn't my favorite of the three.  While the movie has some undeniably memorable moments (the final lightsaber battle, the Death Star raid), as a whole it fell short of its predecessors. The anticipated romance between Han and Leia practically fizzles out, Mark Hamill's limited range as an actor is more evident here than in the rest of the trilogy, and the Ewoks were just too Care Bear-like for the end of a mountainous saga. (George Lucas's fascination with the short fuzzballs makes me wonder, does he think EVERYONE adores them??  The Ewoks have at least two movies of their own, and they're awful!)",0
618,10.0,"This is easily my favorite Star Wars movie and possibly my favorite movie of all time. The story is excellent, and unlike the previous movies which had a feeling of gloom, Return of the Jedi produces mixed feelings. It is a happy ending, and yet sad. Very few movies ever touch my emotions even lightly, but the ending -- with Yoda, Kenobi, and Anakin appearing one last time to look at Luke -- did so. It is an even more stunning movie now that Episode I has been released, and we have seen the lovable boy that Darth Vader used to be. His catharsis was long overdue, but it was not too late for a heartwarming end to the trilogy.",1
619,,"By the time of George Lucas' third installment of his Star Wars trilogy, the series had already surpassed itself through the previous two films leaving good old George a tough job in rounding off his landmark saga.  In terms of plot, originality and creativity, Jedi distinctly lacks in comparison with its predecessors and is more direct on resolving old questions and stories rather than taking any new paths.  The most inventive and diverting sequence in the film is its first half-hour in which our heroes attempt to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hut, after which things regress into a notably routine formula.  ",0

621,10.0,"If you ask me, this is the best in the OT. What really clinches it for me is Vader's redemption and the victory celebration. And the whole thing about the DVD version-you know, Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw-get over it. As look as George doesn't replace Sebastian when the mask comes off, I don't mind. I already got the 2004 version of the dvds, so if George does decide to replace Sebastian in that scene, he can go right ahead. I won't like it, but I won't lose sleep over it. The empire strikes back is a VERY close second, but still second. A new hope is overrated, but still good. This is the 2nd best in the whole saga, the first being revenge of the sith. A lot of people have a problem with the ewoks. Who cares? They're in the movie for half hour at the most. That is a horrible excuse to not like this movie. And, my favorite debate: Leia remembering Padme.",1
622,,"The original plot for ROTJ was far better. It took far longer to rescue Han Solo, and he eventually died as the big sacrifice in defeating the empire (as a retribution for his sins as a smuggler), the Emperor wasn't in it at all, it was the Wookies and not the Ewoks who helped defeat the Empire - and Leia was NOT Luke's sister, that was thrown in at the last minute to tie up a loose end. At the end she was supposed to become Queen of her people. Anyway, that didn't happen and the story was far too light after the darkness of The Empire Strikes Back, with only the climax between Luke, Vader and The Emperor having any significant power. But the main problems with ROTJ are:",0
623,8.0,"This was everyone's favorite as a kid but for me I never clicked with this film until I was older. ROTJ had always been a mixed bag for me up till recent years where I actually paid attention to the deeper story at hand. The storyline between Luke and Vader is so profound and so powerful that it's conclusion will stand to the rest of time. The low points in this film for me is everything surrounding that plot line. Jabba's Palace is way too long, almost like a short film as the beginning of this film. The Ewoks subplot slows the pacing of the movie but the space battle is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Overall, this is no 'Empire Strikes Back' nor 'A New Hope', it is a great solid conclusion even if it can be messy throughout.",1
624,8.0,"The original ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" has rather impressing effects and a great story. When you see what they almost ruin this using CGI and other changes in the movie's later Special Edition, it makes you wonder why they even added things to the original movie.",0

There are weird stuff and creatures.",1
626,7.0,"Honestly I liked how Luke was able to bring his father back to the Light side. Darth Vader was never the bad guy. Darth Vader was just the puppet and Emperor Palpatine pulled the strings, but Luke wasn't going to let Palpatine touch his strings even though he temporarily stole Luke's lightsaber. This movie is such a classic and I can't believe it's already 38 years old.",1
627,,"I'm afraid I have to say that Return of the Jedi is a shameful end to the trilogy. Not only is it far too cheerful, but the storyline was rushed and weak, the acting was appalling, the spaceships were uninspiringly filmed, the end sequence was cheesy to the extreme, the aliens looked rather....well, they were really bad. There is one redeeming feature...the speederbike sequence is good, even better than the Starwars trench scene. Other than that, I was disappointed.",0
628,,"Return of the Jedi is actually a very good film with some tense action scenes, great acting and some annoying Ewoks. Actually, the Ewoks are the main reason why this film is the least popular of the series, they are just way too cute for me, but I could handle them more than the Gungans from Episode I. The plot: The Empire is in the middle of constructing a new and more powerful Death Star while Luke, Leia and the gang rescue Han Solo from Jabba The Hutt. Darth Vader is still looking to turn Luke over to the dark side of the Force with the help of Emperor Palpatine. Although perhaps the weakest of the series, this film definitely has the best action sequences, I loved the bike chase and the whole Battle of Endor. The acting was great, especially from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, you can tell they are comfortable with their roles in this one. This is a great sequel and I would recommend it to anyone who has watched The Empire Strikes Back to complete the most important parts of the storyline.",1
629,10.0,"The end of the Star Wars series, thankfully, isn't a bad one. Better than Episode 4, but not even close to Episode 5, Marquand's first and last excursion into the Star Wars universe explains much, entertains much, and ends the Star Wars Saga spectacularly and dramatically. The presence of the Ewoks never bothered me. I was fond of them from the start, and even more so when I laid eyes on Jar Jar. McDiarmid gives a wonderful performance as the Emperor, the special effects are better than the first two, and the story is told in a grandeur that is apparent in all the Star Wars films. Williams' score outdoes the originals' by a longshot, the ""Luke and Leia"" theme is beautiful. The emotional impact is increased in this one because we need to settle things after the unsettling events of Episode 5. Luke confronts Vader, love blossoms between Leia and Han (now rescued), and Luke becomes a Jedi. The Saga may end with this one, but that sure is a beautiful way to die.",1
630,8.0,"Star Wars is a legend. Why? I started watching the series by asking myself this, but I wanted to watch it in the order of its release, not in chronological order. Because I want to watch movies the way the followers watch them. I wanted to experience the same things as those who followed the series. That's why I started. I wasn't impressed at all in the first movie, nor in the second movie. I mean, they were beautiful, of course, but it wasn't like that legendary Star Wars I was told about. It was very simple, the messages wanted to be given were shouted. Good men bad men, everything was clear. It even felt childish after a while. But this movie changed my perspective on the series.",1
631,8.0,"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi has always been criticized for not matching the quality of Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980). While this is true, hardly anything matches the quality of those films. Jedi comes far closer than most, only failing through an over-simplified plot, some lacklustre acting from Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (dumbing Han Solo down to a cartoon character, for some reason) and a slow midsection. Oh, and those bloody Ewoks. The teddy bear people are okay for five minutes or so, but far too much time is spent on them when there's much more interesting things going on.",0

633,,"Many critics, including me, feel this is the weakest installment into the Star Wars trilogy.  I feel the reason behind it is that there is too much familiar going on too quickly.  There is: the battle to destroy the Second Death Star (a theme from the original movie), the battle between father and son continues (a theme from the second movie), and the love affair between Han and Leia is a slight distraction (also a theme from the second movie).  The new list of characters is impressive - the cuddly Ewoks and the vile Jabba the Hutt make their initial appearances.  (We can also get a glimpse of a skinnier Jabba in Star Wars IV: A New Hope - New Edition version).  The beginning is the best part of the movie...although the special effects keep us glued from beginning to end.",1
634,7.0,"I have several problems with this third installment in the Star Wars story (OK, to the Star Wars geeks, the 6th installment). As much as I can't stand those awful Ewoks, the worst part about this Star Wars is a script that sucks the life out of the main characters..especially Han Solo (you get the sense that being in carbon freeze for who-knows-how- long softened his brain). Luke's no fun anymore either. Hamill tries too hard to sound like Alec Guinness as Obi Wan did in the first one, and it doesn't work. Then there's the emperor, who is not just evil, but obviously a narcissistic a-hole who loves to hear himself talk. In several scenes he says pretty much the same annoying stuff (telling Luke that Luke now serves him, blah blah). I think the audience got the point the first time he said it. ",0
635,9.0,"When it comes to the Star Wars Original Trilogy, Return of the Jedi is generally regarded as its weakest part.

Kevin Smith said it best: Jedi was just a bunch of muppets.",0
638,8.0,"It's hard to say wheather I like this film or not. Clearly it's the weakest of the 4 current works. Ewoks, bleh, I would have liked to seen the Wookies instead. Han Solo on the ground? It would have been cooler if Luke and Leia were leading the ground battle while Han and Chewie lead the space battle. I loved Jabba's palace and the SE made it better. The Emperor was great, better than the guy on TESB hologram. I think Vader was toned down for this film, since his master was there, he couldn't be the BAD guy he was in Empire. I think that everyone fit in their roles quite well. Hammil actually did a satisfactory job in this film (compare it to ANH and you will notice the difference). Boba Fett becoming lunch wasn't a great move, I think he should have left Jabba's after Chewie was captured. It would have been cool to see him go after Luke on Endor or something like that. I think that this film wasn't all it could have been, Lucas showed himself slowing down and out to make it more family oriented than the previous two. The development of Han and Leia's relationship was cut down to a minimum and it focused more on adventure than a great story telling like TESB had.",1
639,8.0,"As trilogy cappers go, Return of the Jedi does feel a bit like they stopped taking it seriously. I mean firstly, what on Earth is Luke's plan in those Jabba's Palace sequences? Let's all go in one by one and get captured then see what happens? Secondly: remember our cool new villain Boba Fett that's really popular? Let's have a blind man accidentally knock him into a giant hole in the floor 15 minutes in. Third: the Ewoks. Because what Star Wars really needed was a race of space teddy bears that throw rocks at highly trained soldiers and worship C3PO as god. And let's not even mention the out of nowhere, clearly unplanned reveal that Leia is Luke's sister which makes certain scenes in the last two... at the very least odd to watch.",0
640,7.0,"Star Wars Episode VI: The Return Of The Jedi, is directed by Richard Marquand, and is the last of the original trilogy. This film isn't perfect, and it doesn't hold up as well as the previous two. This is mainly due to the overuse of CGI in certain scenes, which really removes the viewer today. Also the direction doesn't compare to The Empire Strikes Back, which is shown purely by the difference visually between the films. Also certain plot points are quite silly and pointless particularly the Ewoks which seem to be added as a selling point for children. On the other hand there are great moments in The Return Of The Jedi. Some of which include the space action sequences, and also the powerful character foil between Darth Vader and Luke. The climatic moment in the movie builds to be very intense, although it is resolved way too easily. Character decisions and epiphanies happen so abruptly, that it does not feel realistic. All in all as a trilogy, it is one of the best in history. Star Wars: The Return Of The Jedi is not a terrible film, but it is the weakest in the trilogy so therefore I give it a 7.",1

I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.",1
642,7.0,So its now been confirmed that ROTJ is the final Star Wars film (although im willing to bet the studios wont be able to resist trying to squeeze a few more golden eggs from the Star Wars Goose. With or without GL's consent). So what do we think of the end of the worlds greatest saga?,1
643,10.0,"As a big Star Wars fan such as myself, you've really got to appreciate the original trilogy. The acting wasn't the greatest, but acting isn't what made or makes Star Wars movies great. It was much cooler to see Luke with a green lightsaber, rather than a blue one. Not to mention, his own lightsaber. We finally got to see Jabba the Hutt, the infamous gangster who wanted our hero Han Solo so badly. Despite being a disgusting creature. And of coarse, good finally overcame evil when Darth Vader gave his life to save his son and realized how wrong he was. The ewoks were cute. The movie managed to sell big sets like Jabba's throne set, the ewok village, and of coarse, Jabba's sail barge. (Good luck getting that one, It'll cost you an arm and a leg) I also think the Title ""Return of the Jedi"" was a better idea then ""Revenge of the Jedi"".",0
644,10.0,"Of all ""Star Wars"" movies this is my favorite. Lighter and faster than its predecessor, it contains marvelous action scenes, excellent plot, a lot of humor and in the same time drama. It is the conclusion - at least for now - of the long running scifi saga and it has everything in it. Luke finally becomes a very cool and charismatic character, like his teacher Obi-Wan. Han and Leia are again likable and the Ewoks are hilarious. Darth Vader, the ultimate villain in the series finally reveals his better side and to look his personal dilemma, hidden behind his vile looking skull mask is fascinating. but fans of bad guys, do not worry. Hell has a new face as Emperor Palpatine, the true arch demon of the series and it is a great new face. The emperor is cunning, evil, dangerous and almost terrifying. The action scenes in the film are excellent and the tension is very high. Overall, a classic. I love it.",1
645,10.0,"This is it, the best of the series, and the original conclusion to the saga. It took everything great about the previous movies and brought it to unbelievable heights. I could go on for hours about what makes this movie so good, but I'll try to keep it short.",1
646,10.0,This is the MOST character driven film of the Star Wars saga. George said he wanted an emotional ending between Luke and his father and with the Emperor in the mix that is exactly what we got.,0
647,9.0,"Episode VI finishes the story of the first two trilogies with many memorable fights, deaths and a touching finale. Luke is at his best as a Jedi, we have an amazing rescue for Han Solo from Jaba with Princess Leia being in a super sexy dress, we have the cute ewoks, the death of Master Yoda after serving his cost seeing Luke ready to face his father and having passed the information about Leia being his sister, we see Anakin being released form dark force in order to save his son and kills the emperor. Seriously there so many unforgettable moments in this movie that conclude everything that happened in the previous amazing 5 movies and it makes you very happy that the good guys triumph after all. That last scene of Luke seeing the Jedi ghosts of Anakin, Obi Wan and Yoda being happy that finally the galaxy is saved from the forces of evil leaves you with a big smile.",1
648,8.0,"The finale of the original trilogy does not quite live up to the hype built up by its predecessors, but still gives fans a conclusion that will satisfy their desire for a complete story as it wraps the complete narrative up very well despite the movies flaws. The emperor with Luke is one of the best things about the movie as one feels the pull in both Luke and Vader. The action is some of the best in the trilogy AT TIMES. The Endor sequence is exciting when focused on our leads and their fantastic chemistry which carries much of the film as well. However, the movie does feel to similar to the movie that came out six years before it in the original in terms of overall plot structure. Also, the troopers losing a battle to teddy bear ewoks is possibly the most unbelievable thing in the saga. Despite these flaws the action is great mostly, and certain sequences such as the throne room and the tunnel chase with the Falcon are too classic to pass up. Also the conclusion to the story is very satisfying and will still leave you smiling.",1

Then, when they decided to make the rest of the movies, everyone was drooling and losing their minds over it. I just never felt the urge to go see any. So, anyway, a few weekends ago, I borrowed all six from my friend and watched them over a period of a week, or so. Now that I'm finished, I must say that I am a little bit disappointed. Maybe I missed the boat (or train, or bus, or wagon or whatever means of transport that Star Wars buffs take), but I just wasn't as engrossed in the characters as I hoped I would.",1

652,10.0,"I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister Darth Vadar. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time.",1
653,10.0,"Return of the Jedi is great. It has that great exuberant feeling to it that has you at the edge of your seat in suspense. And you have good reason to, because this is the final chapter in one of the greats Sci-Fi series of all time. All the Star Wars films have meaning to them. Star Wars starts the story, The Empire Strikes Back progresses the story further, and Return of the Jedi raps it up in this fine peace of cinema.",1
654,8.0,"Every movie addict loves the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and many of them consider it the perfect three-film experience. I'm totally okay with that, although I can't say that ""Episode VI"" is as good as its predecessors, which is fine considering how good the previous films are. ""Return of the Jedi"" is one hell of an entertaining experience, but I think it lost some of the genius in the writing to deliver a politically correct ending to an overall family friendly saga. Awkwardly enough in this movie there are some of my favorite scenes in the trilogy (the revelation of how Luke and Leia are connected; the showdown with Jabba's crew; the epic fight between Luke, Vader and the Emperor) and some of the worst (the introduction to Jabba's palace; the Ewoks), and still every scene feels like it needs to be there and (just like its two predecessors) like it is essential sci-fi adventure film. For all the cheesiness and plot-holes that can be there, ""Star Wars"" is one of those cinematic miracles that you love no matter what rationality induces you to think, because art works exactly that way, more on an emotional level that on a cerebral one. So, I can't rate ""Return of the Jedi"" as high as the other two films, but with the note that I love it just as well.",1
655,4.0,"Jedi was not all that bad. But it is still stupid because it is star wars. Luke goes to a palace in the same desert planet from the first movie to rescue a pirate and a feminist social justice warrior. But he had no plan! Wtf? Then we are introduced to this old guy, who is the real villain. Another dull plot twist, but instead of being stupid, it was more of a random twist. Then Vader throws him down a giant hole because of Luke being his son. (Obi Wan was a liar, telling Luke that his dad was killed, but no. Obi Wan is the most wicked person in the saga!) I am glad they ended it there, but oh no, they had to make prequels.",0
656,9.0,"""Return of the Jedi"" is widely considered the weakest of the Original ""Star Wars"" Trilogy, and I agree. ""Jedi"" lacks the breakneck pace and narrative focus of the first two, and its famous climax is essentially a less interesting remake of the Death Star sequence from ""A New Hope."" But despite its flaws, ""Return of the JedI"" is still a fun space opera with some of the best moments in the entire ""Star Wars"" saga.",1

661,10.0,"I have been a Star Wars fan for about 6 years now and no saga has ever been as great as the Star Wars saga. Everything is good about this movie, from meeting Jabba for the first time {Although I meet him for the first time in Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope Special Edition}, to the speeder bike chase on the forest moon of Endor. The only complaint that I don't like about this movie is the small teddy bear-like bears called the Ewoks. Now most people thought that this movie was a disappointment because of them, but I think there not that much of a burden, it's just a not so great idea from writer George Lucas.",1
662,,"What I can say about this film, is that it is truly a work of garbage and sh*t all balled up into one. George Lucas gave the audience a peek of what was to come in his future Star Wars films. Poor action, script, annoying characters, such as the ewoks. The Jar Jar Binks of the early 80's, and total boredom. Such as the prequels bring to us today. What's good about this film... nothing. Lucas lost his magic, excuse me, luck in the seventies after The Empire Strikes Back which was made in 1979. I can't believe those Star Wars idioits worship this muck. A truly awful film of any kind. It's sad that all the hype that surrounds Star Wars, out of all five films that were made, only the first two films of '77 and '80 are the only ones that are worth watching. ROTJ is a film that begs the question, ""What the hell were they thinking?"" * out of ****.",0

664,8.0,"There's no doubt that a large part of the appeal of 'Return of the Jedi' for me was the action-packed scenes and special effects. However, the movie is also a continuation of the classic battle of ""good versus evil"", with many religious and spiritual themes. Many topics such as greed, temptation, and redemption are debated in this film, and I've read that George Lucas admits that he injected religion into the 'Star Wars' trilogy (see Time magazine, April 26, 1999). ",1
665,10.0,"Retuen of the Jedi is normally ranked as the weakest in the Original Trilogy, but I think is the best. It had sequences that never gonout of style. The emotion is incredible, and had the best ending of all of the films. All scenes whether they are on Tatooine, Dagobah or Endor make it a faultless episode.",1
666,9.0,"This magical series of films which chronicled the ascent of Luke Skywalker from a boy living in the desert with his aunt and uncle, to a great Jedi Master who is even more powerful than his father, captured my imagination as a child. Return Of The Jedi provides those faithful to the films with closure and also a glimpse of a magical film that finished with the brilliance of it predecessors. The special effects of this film are astounding, proving that the movies only improved in this aspect. The beginning of the movie is spellbinding from Luke's attempt to play a mind trick upon Jabba The Hut to their escape from the monster in the desert. The romantic connection between Princess Laie and Han Solo is realized at last, and also adds special meaning to the film. Overall this movie is superb, flawlessly showcasing the genius of George Lucas.",1
667,8.0,"Most people put this as their least favorite of the original trilogy. Not that it's bad it's just not as good as the other 2. However, there is one group of people who say that this is the best Star Wars movie and I can definitely see why. The best parts of this movie are when Luke is with Darth Vader and the emperor trying to make Vader ""return from the dark side of the force."" It's very deep and emotionally compelling. The climax is also very satisfying. Without giving away too much, it is pleasantly surprising if you consider what happened in Revenge of the Sith. I also like the space battles. They were great and a lot of fun. It's also good to see some continuity with The Empire Strikes Back by making Lando return. While he is kind of minor, it was still nice to see him. I also like the way the Han and Leia thing was resolved. It's still a cute relationship and their interactions are cute and fun. In fact, that's one thing this movie does have over the 2 movies. The interactions between Vader and Luke are the highlights of the film and many of the other characters play off the other characters very well. So taking all of that into account, what makes this movie not as good as the other 2 in the original trilogy? Well there are 2 things that very hard to overlook. This movie is extremely lighthearted compared to the last movie. Well most of the movie is pretty dark but, the ewoks are really cheesy for the Star Wars films. They take out all of the tension in the scenes they appear in. However, it's not that bad since we need something kind of lighthearted to balance out with the overall darkness of the rest of the film. The other problem I have with this movie is that the opening scene in Jabba's palace is way too long and kind of boring when they aren't battling off monsters. Listen, I get that you need to make this movie 2 hours long for your marketing to adults or whatever but this is really pushing. You could've either trimmed the opening A LOT or cut it out entirely and make a change to how they get Han Solo back. Overall, I guess my problems don't hurt this movie that much since I still love it just not much as some of the other films and hey at least we do get that awesome ending in the ewok camp.",1
668,,"I saw this movie as a kid, when my mother took my sister and me to the theatre to watch it. When I saw it again after it's re-release a few years back, it was as good as I remembered it to be. The action, adventure, characters, plot, music and atmosphere makes it the best of all the Star Wars movies.",1
669,,Well what can I say? All good things must have an end. So George Lucas ends the first trilogy just as wonderfully as he began it. A great ending to a great trilogy although I really could've done without the Ewoks.,1
670,6.0,"Until the overblown Episode I made its belated appearance, this film held the dubious honour of being the weakest of the Star Wars films. Which is a pity, because the opening few minutes on Tattooine, with the rescue of Han Solo and the demise of the repulsive Jabba the Hutt are terrific. This initial high standard is not however sustained. Mark Hamill is frankly wooden in what should be the pivotal role. Harrison Ford's instinct that his character should have been killed off in this film is probably correct. Carrie Fisher has fun in a gleeful ripoff of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, although the ewoks are just plain silly, looking far too much like teddy bears to be taken seriously in what is supposed to be a desperate battle for the future of the galaxy.",1
671,9.0,"Everything that fans criticise about the prequel trilogy starts here in Return of the Jedi. The screenplay lacks the humour of the first two films and the characters are serious and barely recognisable from their previous incarnations. Kasdan makes the fatal blunder of keeping our hero's actions mysterious in the first act making Jabba the Hutt the default lead of the film and confusing us as to whose story is really being told. The audience is left cold by Alan Hume's muddy cinematography and Richard Marquand's weak directing - especially in the action sequences which don't come close to those in the first two films. Lucas painted himself into a corner in this respect by quitting the Director's Guild and severely limiting the talent available to him. ILM, Ben Burtt and John Williams acquit them selves admirably as usual and the drama of the Luke/Darth/Emperor confrontation keeps the film afloat despite the rehashed Death Star attack and the goofy Ewok battle. The Ewoks are criticised for being childish and silly even though they are no less silly than say the Jawas in the first film, however the cartoonish alien elements were used as entertainment in the first two stories and didn't factor into the drama of the final battle sequences which is why I think audiences felt something was off in this story. Despite all this it is still our last true journey into the original world of Star Wars, a place we haven't been to since 1983.",0
672,10.0,"Richard Marquand does an excellent job on this fantastic movie. The Star Wars trilogy is topped by this, which is possibly the best in the series. Any respectful Star Wars fan should own this on video, or turning the key in their car to drive down to the video shop to buy it. Richard Marquands short career left him with at least one highly recognised and brilliant film. Mark Hammil, Harrisson Ford and Carrie Fisher provide steady performances whilst Ian McDiarmid and David Prowse provide an incredible sense of fear to the film. Star Wars is arguabley the best saga of films we will ever see, and we should be glad that quality films like this exist.",1
673,9.0,"I used to think that Revenge of the Sith was my 3rd favorite SW film but now I think that Episode III is my 4th favorite of the 6 films. Return of the Jedi is a great film, Not as good as New hope or Empire but It is still good. One thing I do not like about it is the ewoks. But the ewoks are better then Jar Jar. If you liked the first 2(of the original trilogy) then you should like this. It has a good light saber duel. So it is a great film. Well, Jar Jar was not in this, thank God. So this is a good film. It is good for the family. So I liked it. So, my overall rating is 8 out of 10 stars. Great film. Awesome. Enjoy the ride. Thank you.",1
674,7.0,Only now does George Lucas feel ready to invest in a more adult representation of his Star Wars Universe. Back in the 80s his creative influence over Kasdan extended to the introduction of some hairy little gimps called Ewoks.,1
675,7.0,"Return of the Jedi was considered the weakest of the entire Star Wars trilogy and people thought that Empire Strikes Back was the best of the trilogy but I personally felt that Return of the Jedi was more rousing than Empire Strikes Back and the best of the trilogy. The good thing about Return of the Jedi is that it's very story-focused and well too. However I strongly felt that storytelling in this movie should have been more deeply focused and colorful than what it is in the film. Another thing is that though Return of the Jedi is better than Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope (according to me) it lacked some or a bit of the cinematic discipline from the previous two Star Wars movies. Also the light saber duel between Luke and Darth Vader is unfortunately and certainly not the best composed light saber duel of the trilogy and should have been much, much better than what it is. Moreover I noticed an editing error in the scene seconds after Luke slices Darth Vader's arm. Despite all of that Return of the Jedi has the Emperor of the evil Galactic Empire who's a memorable villain, a beginning which is heavenly ambitious, it has a haunting atmosphere, has bombastic thrills, has a stunning and rushing score which matches the context of the film incredibly well and gets you emotionally thrilled and enough sudden turns in the movie to satisfy. The movie is overall a deliciously entertaining Star Wars episode which makes you greedy and it is a true welcome back to a galaxy far, far away and a fitting end to the trilogy. My rating: 7.2/10",1
676,10.0,"I would definitely like to give more than 10 to the Empire Strikes Back movie. For this, I will give 10 out of 10. I liked it much but there were few things that made movie funny. There were some small creatures, making funny noises and jumping here and there, were kind of irritating when used for a long part of the movie. The end of a Legendary villain was also not justified. I mean, you are Vader, you just don't change your feelings all of a sudden.",1

679,9.0,"So it had finally come to be  the final chapter of an epic story. The attention span of a movie audience has always been a limiting factor for the movie industry. When taken into consideration with the time and cost constraints that influence audience attendance at the movie theatre, we can well appreciate the fact that the series concept well accepted for television, is not considered bankable for the movies. A potential investment in the continuing adventures of' by production companies would result in the application of financial prudence, meaning that the preference would rather be to concentrate on one story and if box office success warranted it, the production of a sequel to take advantage of a potential cash  cow. This is still a solid norm today, although more risks are being taken in stories like Star Wars'",1
680,,"""Return of the Jedi"" wraps up the original trilogy of ""Star Wars"" films with incredible special effects and quick pacing. Although not as deep as Empire, it's still an incredibly fun movie. Following the events in Empire, The Rebel Alliance is poised to strike a Deathblow to the empire, which has constructed a new Death Star. Meanwhile, Luke, Leia and Lando infiltrate the fortress of Jabba The Hutt in order to rescue the frozen Han Solo. ""Return"" has some amazing action sequences-we get to see the Lightsaber used in other ways apart from dueling, and also a stunning multi-level battle which sets a new standard in cinematic spectacle(And which was emulated to a degree in Episode I). As for performances, they're a little less focused than in Empire, but there still is greatness, especially in the supporting characters. Denis Lawson, the surviving pilot from the first film and who also had a cameo in Empire, gets to shine here, as does Ian Mcdiarmid as the fierce Emperor Palpatine, a character that will be expanded as the prequels continue to unravel the backstory.",1
681,8.0,"I'm sure that this is a movie that doesn't need commenting on, but I'm going to anyway. This, in my opinion, is the best of the Star Sars movies. It begins in Tatooine with the disgusting Jabba. Luke Skywalker displays his power of the Force and saves Han and the droids. Then the real adventure begins, with a seemingly dormant new Death Star. A battle with cute little teddy bears called Ewoks, a dazzling lightsaber duel between son and father, the revealment of the ultimate enemy, it reaches quite a level of excitement. ",1

Indeed Return of the Jedi is off to a bit of a bad start because it's intention is to finish off this particular trilogy and saga, and thus we all know the ending will involve the heroes saving the day and destroying the baddies (although it could really have taken us for a ride of confusion by having the bad guys winning instead, but that may have been a bit too dark as closure to the Star Wars saga). Indeed the dark ending to Empire Strikes Back took many by surprise, with the good guys essentially not winning, but that's what many consider to be the winning trump card of that film, the fact that it didn't take the conventional path of stopping the villain and saving the day, but this doesn't make Return of the Jedi a bad movie, in fact it's the exact opposite.",1

692,9.0,"Although this last chapter in the Star Wars original trilogy doesn't have the mastery of the Empire Strikes Back or the novelty of Star Wars; it was clearly, at the time, in many respects, the pinnacle of its technological achievements. Everything from production design to visual and practical effects is, once again, taken up a notch and vastly improved upon. The battle of Endor is a brilliant example of how far the technology had come at the time and after all these years, hasn't aged one bit. The movie begins quite well, with Han Solo's rescue by Luke and Co from the clutches of Intergalactic crime boss Jabba the Hutt, it follows quite nicely with Luke's discovery through Obi-Wan of yet more secrets about his origin and the subsequent laying out of the latest plan by the Rebel Alliance to destroy the Empire's newest Death Star. Unfortunately, once the protagonists land on Endor and we have the first few skirmishes with the Empire's troops, they run into the Ewoks. That's when the movie, for me, takes a bit of a nose dive. It thankfully picks up towards the end with the Final Battle and Luke and Vader's ultimate confrontation. That's my only gripe with the movie. Other than that, it is a very entertaining ride and a more than fitting end to a wonderful saga. Great fun.",1
693,7.0,Believable up to the point of the speed bikes in the woods. Then it really fell apart with the band of teddy bears. That was the beginning of the end of Star Wars for me. Come on.

The original trilogy is much better than the prequel trilogy, by far. The effects are so realistic. It's hard to believe that this movie was made about 30 years ago. James Earl Jones was the perfect voice for the legendary bad guy, Darth Vader. He just fits the voice so perfectly. George Lucas is a genius. His films changed the world. But sadly this was the end of the trilogy. But don't get me started on Episode I or Episode II. Episode III is great, though, especially the end when young Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. Return of the Jedi is by far the darkest of the trilogy, but not really the best. It is still a great movie, though.",1

703,7.0,"Return of the Jedi is a 1983 epic space opera/space fantasy film directed by George Lucas and is the third and final film of the original Star Wars trilogy. Return of the Jedi once again takes us back into the amazing world of Star Wars and continues the journey of the franchise's beloved characters. However, unlike the previous two which are considered two of the greatest films of all time, Return of the Jedi has a few flaws which unfortunately hold it back from continuing this impressive trend. While it does have arguably some of the most powerful and emotional moments of the original trilogy it also has both the weakest and at times even silliest, the main target for this are the infamous Ewoks which has divided fans, as a personal preference I find they add little depth too the story and at times are the cause for scenes to feel unimportant, unnecessary and often stall the movie, as well as the far fetched third act battle which adds my disdain for them. Another of Return of the Jedi's flaws is the inclusion of a second Death Star, which never seems to have the same weight, intensity and fear that the first injected in the Rebels and viewers alike, and primarily serves as the Empire's base rather than an actual powered battle station. However, many aspects in Return of the Jedi do succeed for instance the film once again expands the beautiful and fascinating galaxy of Star Wars also the hugely powerful final confrontation between father and son and finally the jaw-dropping battle sequences in the third act. The first act also shines through with a brilliant conclusion to the cliffhanger at the end of Empire. Many of the same brilliant and iconic shots and scores are continued in Return of the Jedi. However, again unlike the original and Empire a few shots and special affects do nowadays seem dated. Overall, Return of the Jedi is a brilliant and emotional end to the original trilogy-but not hugely satisfying due to the more immature nature of the Ewoks and the stalled pacing of the second act as a whole. Certain aspects and exposition of the disappointing future prequels did seem to seep into Return of the Jedi at times, but generally they do not hold back the movie and is still a thrilling adventure to be viewed by all. 7/10",1
704,8.0,"I still give it an 8 because it's a fun movie. When more ""new star wars"" movies are made (and you know they will be) I hope Lucas hands off the franchise to someone who will start the next series *after* these classic films. Hey, the Dark Side didn't just disappear, and Luke could easily be tempted by the same lust for power that Darth was. There's still plenty of movie to be made after RotJ, movie that can't help but be more interesting than this dreadful (and pointless) prequel stuff we've been handed.",1
705,9.0,"* Spoilers * 'Empire' may be the best of the three movies in the original Star Wars trilogy artistically, but ROTJ, in my mind, is and always was unsurpassed by the other two movies in terms of action and sheer scale. There's just so much happening in this movie as Lucas tries to wrap up the trilogy; there's the rescue of Han and ensuing capture and escape from Tatooine, then the resumption and conclusion of Luke's training, the planning for the assault on the second Death Star, the landing of the infiltration party on Endor, and finally the interleaved 3-way finale between the battle on the surface of Endor, the battle in space, and the final confrontation between Luke, Vader, and the Emperor. I think one of the main reasons this film is so overlooked in the trilogy is simply because of the Ewoks, which is a shame. That, in my mind, is something that can be overlooked. Yes, they are corny in some scenes, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And the ending is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy - more so than most other sci-fi trilogies these days seem to be able to manage (i.e. Terminator, the Matrix). Who can forget that scene, with Darth Vader dying in Luke's arms...""you were right about me Luke...you were right..."" It's just brilliant, and at the same time, a sad ending to a great epic story of finding one's purpose, not giving up, redemption, and the ultimate triumph of humanity and love over evil. Too bad Lucas hasn't been able to recreate the magic in the new trilogy, though (mainly because the characters suck, in my opinion). ROTJ gets a 9/10 in my book.",1
706,,"After the deep impact of Star Wars and the greatest in the genre that I have seen in Empire, Return of the Jedi is a major disappoinment but hardly a bad film.

I won't beat up the poor Ewoks anymore then they already have been beaten up but I must also be counted in the ""this was a big mistake"" department.  Seeing Wookies (the original idea) throwing Stormtroopers around would have been the battle to end them all but we don't get it.  Indeed the presence of the Ewoks symbolize the major problem of the movie, it's utter lack of seriousness in many places.  After the near apocalyptic feel of Empire, this is just too much of a letdown.  On the positive side, the battle between Luke and Vader is great, symbolic and intense and the space battle is still the coolest and best overall space fight sequence I have ever seen.  It's the major joy of this film and it delivers BIG TIME.  Overall a major let down because the Endor sequence is just too hokey.  The rest is largely overblown because the Endor sequence occupies too much of the middle.  Still beats Episode One and Two by a mile.",1

Like the epic sequels of THE GODFATHER and THE DARK KNIGHT trilogies, the original STAR WARS has one of the greatest in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. In fact, ESB was so good, like GODFATHER, PART II and THE DARK KNIGHT, that it set the bar extremely high for the next film. And, that, to me, is RETURN OF THE JEDI's biggest flaw, it had to follow the masterpiece that is ESB! Other than that, ROTJ is awesome! It contains one my personal favorite lightsaber duels and one of my favorite conclusions of the Skywalker Saga!

It's really, really good, and it's massively underrated, just because of the whole Ewok ordeal! Not many people were disappointed by this third and seemingly final chapter, to the Star Wars trilogy, but the first two are still better!

The way he changes subjects whenever Luke mentions there is still good in him is a master stroke of script writing. He is such a dynamic character it is scary. Excluding the main character from Vertigo, I have never seen someone show their emotions in such a realistic way.

The little fur ball jumping around singing is plain stupid. In the original scene the song sounded cool and flowing, the alien characters are puppets, but are serious and cool looking. I went and bought the original Star Wars VI on VHS tape because that scene has been ruined. I think adding computer animation can be beneficial...or damaging as well.",1

727,,"I remember coming out of the movie theater in 1983 and feeling disappointed with this movie.  I've seen it a number of times since on video and in the theater (Special Edition Version).  I was so pumped up after 'Empire', and at the time couldn't pinpoint what let me down.  Some of it was characterization. Solo wasn't Solo, Luke didn't really seem to live up to the title of 'Jedi' - he had to be helped by Vader to defeat the Emperor. Probably everyone has movies that they daydream about re-writing the ending to.  In my ending for the movie, Vader tries to throw the Emperor into the power core, gets slammed against a bulkhead, the Emperer comes back to finish Luke, and Luke finally figures out what Obi-Wan and Yoda were trying to teach him, and is able to deflect the energy bolts and push them back on the Emperor, destroying him. I thought the Emperor came off kind of like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz - not as a powerful evil leader of the dark side.  He cackled a lot, and said things like 'well now, my young Jedi, watch your rebel fleet be destroyed, and your little dog Toto too!'. I kind of thought the Ewoks were cheesy, and yes, the battle scene in the forest asked that reality be suspended too much (two big logs coming together are going to smash an ATST and cause it to explode?).  I am looking forward to the three prequel movies, but now I hear what may be the unkindest cut of all. After all this, Lucas may not make episodes VII, VIII and IX because he says it would take too long, and he never had a story for those anyway.  So we'll get to see the prequels, though we know how those end up, but the finale to the series of movies will probably be the disappointing 'Jedi'. *Sigh*.",1
728,10.0,"Overall while Return of the Jedi is not the best Star Wars film its always been my personal favorite of the bunch. Yes there are problems like the dance sequence original or special edition is not well done, as well as Boba Fett death is dumb, and while I actually like the Ewoks the scenes in the middle of the movie are slow. But their is a lot to love in Return of the Jedi the scenes with Jabba the Hutt and the criminal underworld of Star Wars adds more to the world and makes it more loved in. It also has the greatest space battle in the history of Star Wars and it still holds up today. Last but least it has the greatest scenes in movie history with Luke, Vader, and the emperor, just everything about from the sets, to the music, and the acting is pitch perfect and it rivals anything in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Overall Return of the Jedi while not a perfect movie is a perfect ending with all our characters happy and the galaxy is at peace after all this time it's just heartwarming to watch and best of all it feels earned after what everyone went though. Overall that is the why overall it's not best but my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. Overall grade= A-",1

The only reason for watching this movie is the very reason I loathe the others:  STORY.  The resolution of the Father-Son conflict comes to a climactic head in this movie.  Maybe it's Freudian, but it's comforting to witness Luke's compassion and love for his father proving wiser than Yoda and Obi-Wan's ""kill him and let God glue back together the pieces of Darth Vader"" mentalities.  In the end, Vader saves Luke's life. Which, really, brings us to a conundrum, doesn't it?  Wouldn't LUKE be the one the prophesies foretold of bringing balance to the force (opposed to Anakin, as believed in Episodes 1 and 2, and stated in interviews with Lucas)?  Think: Darth slaughtered the Jedi and oppressed people for years! Luke, however, followed a path of enlightenment, and saved his father (and, by extension, the universe) from himself and the Emperor's grip!

This is my least favorite of the original trilogy.  It is still a great film, I gave it an 8, the saber duel between Vader and Luke, the Emperor, the DS2, all provide a great movie.  I didnt partically care for the opening sequence with Jabba's Palace, and Barge, but i did enjoy watching several people including Boba Fett fall to their doom. (dont email me about what the comic book said about him using his rocket pack to get out).  The movie is well done, develops Yoda more, and shows more about the nature of the force, and how easy it is for a young Jedi to turn.

Although the story's beginning is in Empire Strikes Back, I felt the characters were well introduced, and the plot well constructed.  My only disappointment were the ewoks, as they were too teddy-bear like, and seemed to detract from the film's overall serious nature.  The story would have done better making the natives of Endor Moon more fearsome and less cuddly.  The highlight of the film, to me, was the battle between Luke and Vader, and the subsequent battle between Luke, Vader and the Emperor.  The setting of the situation, in both the original and the Special Edition, gave me a feeling of satisfaction, and properly influenced a sense of tension, as I fell all good films should do (I still think the Star Wars IV Special Edition Death Star explosion was tops).  Overall, George Lucas pieced together an excellent film, and I wish he'd used some of the concepts utilized in Return of the Jedi in Phantom Menace.

748,8.0,"I actually think this is better than them. A large part of why I love this movie so much is how satisfying it is, the entire trilogy has built up to the events in this film, so we're completely invested in the characters and situation, it all came together perfectly. All the characters in this film are different than they were in the last two films and if adds to there characters to see that there are still consequences to every action they take. I thought that The Emperor was a fantastic villain for this film as we truly realise just how powerful he is and it was interesting to see how he controlled Vader. The physiological and physical war that goes on between Luke and Darth Vader is done perfectly, now only is is incredibly intense but it's also very Eye opening to see a more personal fight for Vader and we understand just how much the emperor has taken from him. The final three way battle against the empire and the Death Star is done just right because we understand just how much the characters need to rely on each other to succeed, all the arcs feed into each other and I found it to be extremely well done. Now I wanted to address in this review some of the most common complaints with this film and why I disagree with them, for one I thought it was an interesting idea to bring in a second Death Star because it created a new sense of urgency as we know from the get go in this film, the power that it possesses and I thought the way they destroy it in this film was better executed than in the original. While most people were willing to understand that complaint, the Ewoks are extremely hated upon when talking about this film but I really liked the idea of them and found it somewhat inspiring that they went up against the empire. The most powerful scene in this film is that of Vader funeral it was an extremely personal scene and thought that ten silence of Luke staring at his fathers bodies was extremely heartfelt and was a satisfying conclusion to the arc they have built across the series.",1

Had i seen it before those two, i would have come out thinking it was only slightly above average. But the earlier films have built the characters and the fighting cause to such a climax that in the final scenes of this film with Luke and Vader you are left with sensory overload- because it all means so much to you. Acting as always is a top-knotch performance, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill deliver some fantastic roles, while the short appearance of Ian McDiarmid is a memorably acted. While some of the action scenes may seem a bit dated (such as the chase through the forest and the Rancor pit scene), this does not distract from the overall film and they are still enjoyable. With a great mix of action and plot, humour, and of course the classic good and evil battle, forgive me for saying.... the Force is strong in this one.",1

I probably rated this movie too high now that I am thinking about it (I gave it an 8, but probably should have rated it no higher than a 7, or possibly a 6, because those Ewoks really annoy me, and the more I think about it - it has been awhile since I watched the movie, because of those damn muppets - the more annoyed I get.)

The battle with the ewoks itself is the perfect way to round things up, it shows that the battle between technology and the more organically human (despite the fact that they look like freaks and talk gibberish) will always be won as long as there is determination, friendship and teamwork involved, as well as the temptation to avoid joining the dark side (isn't this what Star Wars is all about?)

However, Jedi completed the entire saga with am uplifting twist and did not suffer from the over-stuffing of effects and pointless characters that Episode 1 has.  All the loose ends are tied together and the Empire is finally defeated.  This is a film with incredible action, eye-popping visuals, strong character development and a life-affirming morality.

It could have made leia look like a damsel in distress or just not a confident person but nope they make her fight even more than begore which is good. But other than that, just was alright guilty pleasure. The rest of this film was so amazing that the first half looked okay but just okay. For example, the space battle was so good that just made me feel good and joyful and then rebels one it was an awesome still though, cool looking at the empire with awesome vehicles and ships and all. Also, the lightsaber battle was so great just felt like you were on your edge of the seat though I already have seen the movie it was still great seeing Vader turning after Luke finally understand why the Sith sometimes win. That the sith are not about love or compassion but evil selfish and angry and so gives vader an opportunity to finally defeat darth sidious once and for all ever since the beginning and really at exegol in the comics but with compassion more so than mercy. I also love the emperor in this and how ruthless he was and of course we know the next part of the story for him, but in the meantime, he will be shaking his fist at the skywalker family like Stalin in the real world. I loved the Ewoks just so cute and cuddly lol they are so cool hope we learn a lot more in canon. I loved everything at the end especially seeing the other planets the vader funerial and the force. Just a great end to part of the story but we have last part which will make this very interesting lol. Overall, i loved this film expect the leia slave scene that was cringe but over than that I loved the movie.",1

It was cool finally getting to see what Darth Vador looked like. It must have been a hard and impatient wait for those who watched the movies and had to wait for them to be released in the theatres! Waiting 6 years, wow! I don't think I could have waited that long. Overall, I thought this one was the best of the 3. In 2005, I'll be letting you know what I thought of the last three.",1
764,,"Star Wars: The Return of the Jedi is the best one of the trilogy. George Lucas had a good idea to make a third movie.  The Return of the Jedi has great action.  The first two were good, but the third was the best because the special effects had developed more.  Another reason is a lot of information was released in Return of the Jedi.  You got to learn that Luke and Leia were brother and sister and you learned that Darth Vader was Luke's father. When the special edition started to come out I thought that maybe A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back would be better, but then Return of the Jedi came out and it still reigned as the best star wars movie yet.  Now in a week Episode I: The Phantom Menace is coming out I think that might knock Return of the Jedi out of the number 1 slot for best star wars movie. There is one thing that Return of the Jedi will remain as in my opinion and that is best of the original star wars movies.",1

They can title a movie whatever they want and change whatever they want to about a movie, but when all is said and done, it is our movie, not theirs. It is something that is part of our culture, not just a movie. Enough about that, this movie is great! Jabba, Yoda, Leah in the gold bikini (classic). Even as a kid I wasn't feeling the Ewoks or their village. Yeah they look cute, but remember, they wanted to eat Luke and Han. They like to eat people. I don't care how cute they are, if you are willing to eat me, I'm going to kill you. This movie looks great on DVD and I would recommend it to anyone. Just go rent it and remember how great this movie is. Or better yet, just buy it!",1
766,,"Ok. So this is the worst of the first SW Trilogy. It is the SW Trilogy we're talking about. Third is no disgrace. Having said that, it is some way behind the other two and the weak links are easy to pinpoint - Dance number in Jabba's palace, Ewoks and the repeat of the Death Star plot from Episode IV. But there are still so many more good points - The final confrontation between Luke and Vader while the Emperor looks on, the superb space battle scenes and the continuing revelations within the Skywalker family - these are all essential aspects of the SW mythology. Lucas' films were alays intended as adventures for children of all ages but to go from the dark, brooding (more adult?) second installment to this cuddly tale takes some getting used to. In the context of the trilogy it is an essential if weaker episode, while viewed on its own it is an epic, space adventure with few rivals.

After Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars saga is at a crossing point, the rebels are showing signs of defeat, but have been strong enough to survive. It's difficult tell how they are going to defeat an empire so big. Like most films it's usually a crack shot chance that is thought up miraculously by the main character. George Lucas knew better then to follow with a random luck victory. The movie starts with two druids (C3PO, R2D2) entering Jabba's Palace; slowly Laia and Luke also show up to rescue Han.

773,,"...watched my DVD of ROTJ yesterday. I honestly hadn't seen the film since the orig version- I had bought the VHS set (used) of the ""special edition"" but had only seen the 1st film- I'd watched a few minutes of that version's Empire.... Other than the end of Jedi showing all the new ""celebration"" footage establishing the cities to be seen in Chapter 1 and 2, and the additional Bespin stuff, and the re-ghosting of Anakin ala Hayden ""I seriously need some actin' lessons George!"" Christiansen (in what might be said to be his BEST performance yet...) it was unchanged. And that means a big yawn. Jedi disappointed me on many levels- repeating the Deathstar, the scene where the Emperor is trying to do in Luke (with ""energy bolts""- when will something replace the lightening effect?!?!) and the shots of Darth looking back and forth obviously in a nature brain lock of ""What do I do??""- it could have been executed differently (I know- there's only SO MUCH expression one can give a big IL' dumb black helmet), the use of the goofy-ass giant fish guy as a commanding general, give me a break (GMAB!), the use of what-ever-the-crap-it-was-supposed-to-be as Lando's co-pilot aboard the Falcon. Geeze, George- Those last two were primo instances to exercise your obsession with CGI!!! And since Star Trek VI and a couple of films that overused it, that silly expanding energy ring got tired BEFORE you used it in the ""special edition"". At least continuity was maintained- BOTH 'splodin' Deathstars had it.... (although in Jedi you get to see the sucker expand past the viewer's POV- that was sort of cool). And he did add flames to a TIE fighter spinning out of control into a Star destroyer. Adding all the additional celebration stuff at the end doesn't help the film- the lethargic Pricess Leia performance goes unexplained (""Oh Paul honey! Put down that guitar and pass me that doobie, or toss me a 'shroom button!""), making Han look like he's regressed to some naive kid with very stupid lines, Luke returning to Dagobah to ""complete training"" after he's already told Jabba and the 'world' that he's a Jedi (and effectively demonstrated it in spades) was a weird plot device for what? Showing the casperization of Yoda. Whoopee! Hey George! That dropping blanket after der Yoda vanishes was some hot trick, dude.... Oh and how 'bout when the rescuers are entering Jabba the Butt's palace- here we have all sorts of guises- bounty hunters of every shape and size (staying in the shadows I noticed......why? Doesn't scum and villainy have a right to party openly with the fat sluggoid? Or are they too aware of the trapdoor to Rancor land?), even Leia, disguised by a 1953 Chevy AM radio headpiece (makes me wonder what fantasy of youthdom Geo. Lucas was hung up on in that design...), IS disguised, and in comes Big IL' backstabbin' Lando in some gawd-awful seashell and bones facepiece that looks like something Gilligan made up for the 3rd Halloween party on his island.... Geeze, Dude! You own and run a magnificent skyborn floating city that has fabulous wealth written all over, and you dig up this piece of Jawa poodoo?? Now, seeing Leia in a too brief (and I sincerely believe it could have been BRIEFER) beach outfit was OK, but isn't even the thought of Yoda and humanoidal women together a bit ""10 minutes past perverted""? And George did add more babage to the whole Jabba's lair sequence proving once again the old Popeye film making maxim: ""Out of story substance? Add womens...."" The flying cycle chase(s) are fun, as is the use of the two-legged At-At's, but the whole syrupy teddy bear Ewok stuff? Again, <cough> GMAB. May the forest be with you.",0

Although the cutesy teddy bears are bizarrely integral to the plot, the final half of the film is a tribute to Empire- very dark. Ian McDiarmid, as the Emperor, gets so many excellent lines that I'd swear he'd payed off George Lucas for them. The final battle between Vader (my favourite character) and Luke is enhanced by John Williams' excellent music. Not all the creatures in the film are annoying- the opening sees the droids Threepio and Artoo travelling to vile gangster Jabba the Hutts palace. This is truly classic Star Wars. The scenes featuring the slug- like Jabba are amusing and the various others creatures that inhabit his palace look incredible. All in all- a good follow up to The Empire Strikes Back- 8/10.",1

779,10.0,"Although still great entertainment, it is not quite on the same level Empire Strikes Back or Star Wars. Still, that is no slight on this movie...it is difficult to equal those two masterpieces-- they stand as quite possibly the best sci-fi action movies ever made. The costumes are great, the opening sequence on Tatooine is tense and exciting, and the final space battle blows away A New Hope in terms of scope and size. In addition, the emotion of the final confrontation between Luke and the Emperor/Vader is both cathartic and saddening, as finally the story comes full circle...as Anakin betrayed his Jedi brethren due to fear for his wife's life, so too did he betray the Emperor out of love and compassion for his son. The major themes and morals of the movie may be simplistic and childish to an extent, but it is honest and innocent in its message of love and trust over hatred, anger and fear; there shouldn't be anything wrong with that. More pluses - Yoda and Obi-Wan are back, confirming that Vader is Luke's father- and that Leia is his twin sister!! Han and Leia's love is fleshed out a bit and firmly established during the rescue of Han from Jabba's palace. The Emperor, played by Ian McDiarmid, is deliciously evil as well. This movie is a great transition. The first two movies belonged to Vader, especially Empire Strikes Back. This installment is about Luke's rise and transformation into a Jedi. This is his movie. One could argue that Vader loses this role because he has good in him - because of his inner conflict about his love for his son and his wish to overthrow the Emperor, as stated in the previous movie. Luke's burning of his father's suit is symbolic of this final destruction of Vader. His appearance with Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end is touching. Two negatives - the Ewoks and the ending. The Ewoks are too kiddie, and you can't tell me that the Ewoks and a few rebels could beat imperial troopers and Imperial Walkers in a fight. Also, the ending is a bit too kitschy - rebels and Ewoks partying in the trees? Please. Still these flaws cannot ruin this movie. A great finale to maybe the greatest movie trilogy ever.",1
780,7.0,"I liked the movie. I liked the fact that we get to see more jedi scenes and more lightsabers compared to first 2 movies because let's face it, Star Trek is easily better if it wasn't for some little details such as lightsabers lol.",1
781,8.0,"What was meant to be the end of the middle of the Star Wars Saga, Episode VI- Return of the Jedi (originally titled Revenge of the Jedi), written by Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, sums up in a nice anticlimax, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  The beginning of the sixth episode finds us back on Tatooine (where the first, I mean, fourth enstallment has it's start) where, when it was released back in May of 1983, audiences saw the first of Jabba the Hutt.  But, for the 1997 audiences such as me, and second, and chubbier look.  As for his fate, let's just say, if Episodes VII, VIII and IX were made, we wouldn't see him again. Also, we finally get a look at the great Emperor Palpatine, leader of the Sith Lords, and master to apprentice Darth Vader, now known as Anakin Skywalker.  And, once again, making his third appearance is my favorite underrated character, Wedge Antillies, leading Rouge Squadron on another faulously shot and fantastically made Kamikaze run.  This time, without the help of Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia, who are both preoccupied, one with a rematch, and the taking back of a hand, the other with knocking out the Deflector Sheilds for the second Death Star on the moon planet of Endor, which is inhabited by the all too cute Ewoks.  They look like little Teddy Bears. As I said before, it all rounds out into a nice anticlimax, preparing for the seventh through ninth installments, which Lucas decided wouldn't come.  The series stops at six.  But, all-in-all, with Episode I just released (which is my next review) after 16 years without a new Star Wars movie, fans like me cannot wait until 2002 when Episode II is released. Until then, this is a fine ending.  B+",1
782,8.0,"This is an entertaining movie and fitting closure to the first Star Wars trilogy. And I still enjoy watching it. But there are some minor details that bugs me more and more for each time I see it. It's in the last half hour, during the battle on forest moon Endor, that the annoying details just keep piling up. Maybe some hardcore Star Wars fans can correct me on these: R2-D2 becomes mysteriously mobile in the rugged forest as it seems he has strolled down to the entrance to the base all on his own. Amazing feat, considering he seems to stumble on minor obstacles anywhere else in the three movies. Oh well. Thats a minor detail, a much bigger, more annoying one is that the Storm Troopers gets knocked out by sticks and small stones thrown at them. Why bother with a helmet if it actually does more harm than good?? And finally, when Chewbacca comes along in the big, what are they called again - walker? He doesn't just blast the entrance open. No, they have to use it to ""lure"" out the hapless guards. Well, the single most annoying ""detail"" is the stormtroopers getting knocked out by small sticks and stones.",0
783,8.0,"Well here we are the final installment in the Star Wars trilogy and to an extent a bit of a disappointment, and some parts in the film are of pure quality. The Special Edition treatment does vastly improve the flow of Return of the Jedi and the ending sequence in the Ewok village after the celebrations of the crumbled Empire on Bespin, Mos Eisley and a nicely generated falling statue of the Emperor on Corruscant (Note that i am not explaining the storyline because you should have watched this film) Anyway back to the end sequence, the music allowed the ending to be very moving and the ethereal images of Obi Wan, Yoda and the now redeemed Annakin Skywalker is a nice piece as well. All i can say is this has many good points that the counteract the presence of the ewoks, and the unconceivable reason why all the main characters suddenly just appear (like house guests) at Jabba's Palace. The rest is good, good, good such as a great performance by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine",1
784,9.0,"Tomorrow night at Midnight I will see the next chapter in the saga that is Star Wars.  Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. 	I initially saw Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on its opening weekend in Eureka, CA as a full fledged, but young movie aficionado of sixteen years. Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time.  Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds.  These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers.  Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are wonderful and very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists.  All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. 	Lucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film and the medium of film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin.  I also feel strongly that Jedi is the best Star Wars film thus far. It has tighter pacing, more realistic and fluid dialog and wonderful performances all around.  Richard Marquand probably has a great deal to do with this, but the experience of cast and crew may be the primary reason.  There was a fluidity in Jedi that the first one lacked, and the second one nearly reached, but not quite.  The cinematography was astounding with a mastery of the effects the first two pioneered.  The campy stuff was still there, but it was more natural and the cast was comfortable with it using it as a tool without stumbling over it. The cast and crew had found a chemistry that was remarkable for any film. 	The ""weaknesses"" of any of the Star Wars films as pieces of ""art"", or even craft are dwarfed by their emotional impact and timing of release.  I was ten when I saw Episode IV: A New Hope for the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time.  Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second!  All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was ""can we see  it again dad, can we see it again dad..."".  I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day.  This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I  did.   The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85).  I saw Jedi only for times that summer, I had to work unlike in my younger days. 	My point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is as equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment.  I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two!  All that said however, I wouldn't call all of them ""great films"".  Important and amazing films, ""Hell Ya!"".  Some of the best rides I have ever had, ""Hell Ya!"".  Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. 	Episode VI  is the most ""artistic"" of all the films thus far because it has the advantage of tons of rehearsal and chemistry to rely upon and the advantage of a creator/producer who is responsible to no one but himself and to a much lesser extent the fans.  I think part of  why Jedi is the best may be the fact that I knew that the ""Blue Harvest"" film shot near Crescent City (where I lived at the time) was really Star Wars III (episode VI), where they shot all the wonderful ""forest"" scenes.  I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods for years), yet there they were right in front of my eyes in truly believable DeLuxe color (my favorite by the way) . This may be why Jedi still has the strongest hold on my heart!  I don't think that the story of Jedi is vastly superior to that of Empire, but it is more complex and deals with sophisticated things that I enjoy.  	I am more into temptation, redemption and what is and is not destiny and how much control over such a thing do we have.  These things are more deeply explored and acted out in Jedi as is the love aspect of family, friends and romance.  A touch sappy in some spots and simplistic in others, but hey George always tells us that he is trying to reach your average twelve year old more than anyone else and these films do just that! 	Love one, love them all it is tough to chose in some ways, but Jedi has my vote.",1

There just a bunch of little bears that for some reason the stormtroopers can't kill. (For some reason they can't kill anything else) The light saber fight was good between Luke and Vader but I thought it was to prolonged. The whole first half of the movie is to prolonged. You have to go through 30 minutes of strange aliens dancing. I just didn't get that. I felt glad when Luke finally came into the movie. The plot to destroy the death star was good. It was cool to see the trap that the Rebels just went into blindly and the action was pretty good as well. Overall, it was an OK star wars movie but it could have been better.",0
806,8.0,"I've seen the movies hundreds of times, but this just occurred to me. Does anybody else think it's ""far-fetched"" that the Rebel Alliance would let six (counting the two droids) people to try and rescue Han Solo, in the middle of this galactic war in which they were desperately losing, from Jabba the Hut? I'm not ragging on Solo or anything, because he's a bad-ass, but wouldn't duty, in this set of circumstances, come before friendship?",0
807,8.0,"This movie does not get the credit that the first two movies get. It kinda lives in the shadow of the first two. I guess so many people expected so much out of this movie. Technology definitely had come some length from the first movie. The movie still heavily relied on human acting and emotinons, yet still maintained comical seriousness. But there is something about this film that just doesn't live up to the first two.",1
808,10.0,"Ok, Star Wars: ANH introduced us to the characters. Empire showed the strength of the Empire. And now In Jedi, David wins..again. It's easy to summarize this movie, first they go to Jabba's Palace for about 40 min. then Luke's of to Dagobah, the strike team on Endor,Luke surrenders, Battle of Endor. Now most people say they hate this movie because...then they list some technical comments like they were an avid critic!! Yoy! It's my favorite because of one thing: The Battle of Endor. On the ground, the Empire;s ""best legion of troops"" never had a chance, but in space you see the battle turn once the Executioner goes down. The lightsaber duel revealed a little too much of Vader-not enough fighting compared to ESB (even that didn't have enough)I was surprised how quickley Vader got worned out..oh well. The actual Death Star run was nothing like ANH but it had 2 other things going on and didn't provide that much drama. All in all this is the movie you should watch before you go see Epsiode I this summer-it's the most modern (of Eps. IV-VI) and has the most ties to the prequels. My rating: ***  (3 and a half) out of ****",1
809,10.0,"I can't wait to see it again. it's a fantastic movie that fills all the blanks. It was great to see old Chewie, and that final detail of a young Mof Tarkin appearing beside the Emperor and Darth Vader with the Death Star as a background was magnificent. this might sound lame but tears fell down as Anakin became Darth Vader destroying everything he held dear finishing with a duel with a ""brother"" who ""loved him"". After seeing this movie I can't help to wish that an after Episode VI trilogy may come to life. I was hoping to see something of the 20 years that separate this movie from the next, but as there is going to be a TV series maybe we'll see some of it there. I really didn't like the ""NO!"" that Vader says, it sounds a bit false. May the Force be with you",1
810,,"I have heard a lot of people who say this is the weakest of the original trilogy. I have to completely disagree. This movie is just as strong as it's predecessors. I really loved the ending (especially in the Special Edition). It wrapped everything up really nicely and contained one of my favorite Star Wars scenes. I'm referring to the scene where Luke comes close to suffering the same fate as his father. Like I said, the perfect ending to a perfect saga.",1
811,8.0,Here it is. The last episode of the Star Wars saga and the final step of the Skywalker odyssey is a fitting conclusion. The first time I saw this it immediately became my favorite movie off all time. I watched it every week for a year. Then I began to look at it critically. It's not the best Star Wars. It's not the best movie ever made. It's still my favorite though. The idea that Darth Vader can be saved is the reason I hold above the other two.,1
812,10.0,"Sorry for all who prefer other Star Wars films but this in my opinion is the best Star Wars of them all which makes this the greatest film of all times. It has a great closure sense. How to say without spoilers... The action is great the story is great. What is missing? Romance, suspence and finally closure. Star Wars at it's best possible and since the Star Wars serie is the best movies of all times... Well I don't really need to say it do I? The original trilogie and prequel trilogie conclude with this film. George Lucas should be proud of this film. If you don't watch it you will defenitely miss something so watch it.",1
813,6.0,"This movie was pure crap!!!! I mean common!!! The Death star was already destroyed!!!! And the ewoks??!! Shame on you George Lucas!!!!!! Shame on you!!!!!

""Star Wars episode I: The Phantom Menace"": Thumbs up!!! ""Star Wars episode II: Attack Of The Clones"": Thumbs up!!! ""Star Wars episode III: Revenge Of The Seth"": The best Star Wars-movie ever!!!!!! ""Star Wars episode IV: A New Hope"": Thumbs up!!!!!! ""Star Wars episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"": The best in the original trilogy!!!!! But for ""Star Wars episode VI: Return Of The Jedi"": Face it, all you Star Wars-fans: It sucks big time!!!!

814,8.0,"Good Points:  Again, it's more of the same great operatic sci-fi stuff from Lucas and the guys.  The story moves along nicely through this wonderful fantasy universe highlighted with sweet FX from the geniuses at ILM.  The climax where Luke finally turns to the dark side and attacks Vader is on my Top 10 list of all time great scenes.  Truly a stroke of cinematic storytelling genius.  ",1
815,10.0,"Well, I am pretty much new to Star Wars considering I have been watching it only for like 1.2 years. I used to think Revenge of the Sith was the best movie but ROTS is kind of illogical. But Star Wars Return of the Jedi from its beginning to its end, all were just awesome, destroying rich Hut along with his army with really little effort showed how powerful Luke has become. Then make a plan to destroy Death Star II, land on planet Endor, and create new alliances with Ewoks (yeah, honestly would've been better if it was Wookies, but it's fine), then Luke meets his father; Darth Vader (formerly known as Anakin), then confronting Emperor Palpatine (Darth Sidious) and dueling his father and ultimately defeating him down to the ground, really one of the best scenes in cinema. Then he declared himself as true Jedi by refusing Sidious's offer. When Palpatine strikes and almost kills Luke Vader finally redeems himself and kills his old evil master. The best SW movie in my opinion, though.",1
816,10.0,"Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) is an amazing movie filled with action, humor, and romance. The acting is great and the music is phenomenal. Well, seeing how John Williams wrote the score it is guaranteed to be good. John Williams is an award winning composer and created the score for other famous movies like Jurassic Park, Super Man, Jaws, Close Encounters with the Third Kind, and Indiana Jones. If you want to sample his music you can listen to a compilation by Moosebutter called Star Wars on Youtube. Return of the Jedi is the best Star Wars movie. There are furry creatures called Ewoks that are funny and adorable. There are intense lightsaber duels. There is a major plot twist that will blow your mind. If you like good movies I know that you will like this movie. I have no idea why you wouldn't like Return of the Jedi! The one reason you may not enjoy this movie is because it is a Sci-Fi movie, but it isn't like your typical sci-fi movie with killer aliens trying to take over the world. It is about freedom from an overpowering galactic empire and man's struggle with good versus evil. The movie has a great storyline with good acting and pretty cool special effects. ",1
817,10.0,"Alas, the Original Trilogy ends, but ends with a BANG! Happy endings for every good character, and a ton of action in this third spectacular achievement in STAR WARS. Let's review the ""Special"" Edition first. Do we really need poorly animated CGI aliens singing ""Jedi Rocks""? Is a beak on the Sarlacc really that necessary? And what about the roughest, toughest bounty hunter, Boba Fett, flirting with a B A C K U P S I N G E R? Noticed how I capitalized and spaced backup singer? Well, the four backups, 2 drummers, 2 winds, and 1 green thing playing a wind pipe are TOTALLY Unnecessary EDITIONS TO THE COOL ORIGINAL 3 MAX REBO BAND MEMBERS! Max Rebo on keyboard, Droopy McCool on flute, and Sy Snootles on vocals were good enough to perform an entertaining show for Jabba. Again, I DO NOT recommend the ""Special"" Edition to anyone.",0
818,10.0,"This movie is quite honestly the best I've ever seen in my entire life. It is the ultimate Star Wars movie, with the fun adventure element from the first film and the dramatic imagery from the second. It has been a film I have enjoyed since my childhood, and it can find a place in any time of your life. It has exotic locations and characters, with my favorite being Jabba the Hutt (whom I aspire to be like in ten years). It truly is a work of Sci-Fi masterpiece.",1
819,8.0,"This is a very good movie and worthy successor to the legendary A New Jope and and magnificent triumph of The Empire Strikes Back. However, it is not quite as good as its predecessors, even though it is inconceivable that one could watch and enjoy those two films and then not see Return of the Jedi.",1
820,9.0,"What can I say...I'm glad that I waited. I am a huge Star Wars fan but something kept me from buying the 2004 DVD release...and I am very glad that I didn't. I own both the original edition and special edition of the original trilogy on VHS tapes but have become really annoyed with having to fast forward and rewind through the videos. It is very nice to actually be able to watch both the original and special editions of this ultimate masterpiece in beautiful quality and easy navigation (that is, until they are released in blue ray format of course...). Another reason why I'm glad that my patience has paid off is that the format and color of these DVD cases match up with those of the new trilogy (Episodes I-III) so I can display them on my shelf as a good looking, complete saga. Only true Star Wars fans and those (like me) who appreciate the classic era of film making can appreciate the release of the original theatrical version of the trilogy. Movies such as these were made in a time period without CGI and high end special effects and still remain to be excelling cultural fenominons even today. So I think that it is only fair that the originals be made available to those who wish to remember the legend that brought about special effects in films like none other in its time.",1
821,9.0,Best Star Wars movie ever. Watch this movie before you die.,1
822,10.0,I certainly didn't love this one any less than the fourth one.  ofcourse good one but there was a twist to it and things that happened made sense in the story line.  When Yoda past away it was a sad moment at that time.  It ended well and the whole thing was fun.  I was disappointed to see this one get three stars instead of four stars.  All the starwars episodes from four to six deserved four stars.,0

824,10.0,"A good but not great conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. I did enjoy this more than the original Star Wars but still a step behind Empire. Good special effects and some new characters. For some reason though, I feel it drags for a bit especially the introduction to the Jabba character and the initial meeting with the Ewoks.",1
825,7.0,"Starry-eyed as my 22-year-old self was on opening day for what was then (1983) simply called ""Return of the Jedi,"" I recognized that the special effects wizards at ILM dominated this show. Given what we've seen to date in George Lucas' prequel trilogy, ""Jedi"" was a harbinger of what was to come: increasingly hyper-detailed CGI landscapes populated with sketchy characters. Nonetheless, this did bring the original trilogy to a satisfying, if uneven, close. The battles raging on the forest moon of Endor and in the heavens above the new Death Star, spectacular as they are, really take a back seat to a smaller- scale conflict involving Darth Vader, the Emperor, and a young Jedi that both are trying to bring over to the Dark Side of the Force, Luke Skywalker. It's this aspect of the story that gives the movie's title (which has a few meanings) its resonance.",1
826,8.0,"The return of the Jedi is a mixed bag for quite a lot of people, people are quite divided as to ether this entry in the franchise is actually any good. I'm on the side that that thinks that this film is very good, while it may not be as dark or gritty as The Empire Strikes Back or the fact that it does not possess the novelty that A New Hope had it does not fail to disappoint. I'm not saying that some parts are not weak, but it is not by any stretch a bad film.",0

If you enjoyed the other movies this just amy become your favorite movie of all time. You'll not want to miss the conclusion especially as everything unfolds.",1

It was a perfect conclusion to a perfect trilogy, and the stakes are higher, and it's gonna end one way, or another, and my friends, and I where in the edge of our seats like in the previous movies, It is just the perfect conclusion to the perfect trilogy. It is just a perfect movie. Obviously a 10/10",1

837,9.0,"When talking about Return of the Jedi, it's impossible to discuss the movie without mentioning its two versions: the original one released in 1983 which was a touch of genius and the digitally restored version released nearly a decade and a half later. Recently, Lucasfilms has launched a DVD release that contains both versions; original and digitally restored. That's one big mistake; you can now compare them at your leisure in the coziness of your home. Digitally restored, my butt. Digitally meddled and messed and demeaning are a list of more proper descriptions of what Mr. Lucas did to its work. Most of the changes in the second version were disruptive at best; a few were interesting to see and they complement and flesh out some details but only proving out that Mr. Lucas was only stupid and/or lazy enough of not doing them from the start, marring one nearly perfect film. Other changes were totally disruptive, showing that he doesn't care of his fans' memories and he's more than willing to alienate any possible new following. At the end of both movies it's a big celebration sequence: The original one was plain though heartwarming; simple yet self-contained. In the digitally restored mess, this same sequence loses the carefully timed rhythm of the first version and adds footage that only rabid Star Wars fans would get and tolerate. The Cloud City and Imperial Coruscant sections are to be understood only by those who have faithfully followed the series from the very start. One final note: with this dual DVD release, Lucas made another terrible mistake. He didn't provide us with nice and clean copies of the originals; they're not restored, they're scratched, dusty and a few frames were distorted by age. The digitizing was lousily done, allowing for some heavy flickering in some scenes. And yet somebody ought to tell Mr. Lucas that I'll cherish its original work with all its flickers and flaws and put it in a place of honor in my film collection. His updated work will be more useful as a Frisbee for my dog.",1

843,10.0,In my opinion the six hour plus epic of episode IV through VI of Star Wars are the best movies of all time.  To separate them would not give them justice because it really is one incredible story.  I find the acting to be surprisingly good from mostly relative unknowns and they make the story so much better.  The feeling of depth to this story is what really sets it apart and it is so incredibly entertaining.  The special effects are mind boggling for their time and are still great today.  I love this movie because it made me want to be part of this universe and dream about being there.  The score has to be by the best I have ever had the pleasure to hear and the visuals are amazing.

848,,"After the events in Empire, Luke Skywalker(Mark Hammil), now a Jedi knight, and Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher) try to rescue Han Solo(Harrison Ford) from Jabba The Hutt, a slimy gangster from Luke's home planet. Meanwhile, the Empire is preparing to finally destroy the Rebellion with a second Death Star, while the Rebellion is preparing to destroy the Death Star(again). Managing to escape from Tatooine, the heroes are sent to help disable this Death Star's shield generator. This leads to the inveitable final confrontation, as Luke battles Darth Vader for the last time as the Rebels engage the Empire's vast fleet and legions. ROTJ isn't as serious as EMPIRE, and lacks some of that film's character development. While Mark Hammil is given plenty to do, Harrison Ford's Han Solo is reduced to a watered-down version, sort of a slap in the face after Ford's turn in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Carrie Fisher suffers from the same problem. However James Earl Jones is still in top form as Vader, and Ian Mcdiarmid is excellent as the Emperor, the puppet master behind everything, whose role has been expanded in the prequels.   Still, it's a fun Star Wars film, worth seeing for the final battle alone, the enormity of which is only topped by the LORD OF THE RINGS films. John William's score, especially his renditions of the Imperial March, also serve to elevate the material.",1

All the characters continue to develop correctly as they're face with challenging obstacles that give shape to the overall story. The acting this time was the best out of the entire original trilogy. Every cast member (including Jabba The Hutt if you want) played his or her part professionally and handled their roles profoundly. The third act is pure sci-fi beauty. The space battle remains to this day one of the most iconic. And the whole throne room scene is pure brilliance; the emotional weight surrounding it is what really takes the scene to another level.

The film has aged reasonably well, however. The tone here is again different from either of the first two instalments of the trilogy, becoming a shade more like 'Star Wars' then the darker nuances of 'The Empire Strikes Back.' The wondrous imagination that has been a hallmark of the series remains, as does the beautiful score. There is much here to enjoy.",1

After saving not only Han, but everyone from Jabba, Luke returns to Jedi Master Yoda. The film, like Star Wars, starts out a bit slow and gets uninteresting in some parts.

The crafting of the space battle taking place at the same time as the battle on  Endor while Luke fights the final battle against Vader on the Death Star...thinking about it I wish I'd given this a ten. Lucas tried to do the same 3 battles type sequence at the end of Episode 1 and I felt physically sick afterwards.,1
868,10.0,"You gotta see Star Wars Episode VI because: The SW saga ends here (well, supposedly, according to the numbers of the episodes) Minifurry animals called ewoks are awesome and intrepid and heroes.",1
869,7.0,"This is my favourite movie of the original trilogy, probably because its the one that I remember the best. I was 9 when I first saw it and 7 when I first saw ""Empire""; and of that movie all I really remember, from when I first saw it, is the huge fight between Luke Skywalker & Darth Vader at the end of the film. I never saw ""New Hope"", when it first came out, because I was considered by my parents to be too young, which is probably fair enough, as I was only 4 at the time. Anyway, as I now own the DVD of the trilogy, I can now watch them whenever. :-D",1
870,5.0,"For someone who is watching star wars in 2020, these movies are not exciting enough. They are boring and under-written. The villians were very underwhelming. The dialogues were stupid (I only liked dialogues of yoda and c3po) The acting was weird. The fights were repetitive and long and devoid of any action and adventure. The whole premise of star wars is probably what held it all together. But the final product is just not much fun for someone who has seen so much cool sci-fi in 21st century. It's hard for sci-fi movies to stand the test of time.",0
871,10.0,"Disclaimer: I am 18 years old and until now I had never seen Star Wars. While most people's view on Star Wars nowadays is clouded by nostalgia, here is my unaffected take on these 'classics'. I'm watching in this order: IV - V - I - II - III - VI",1
872,10.0,"The Star Wars trilogy is one of those rare feats where all three movies not only form one big plot, but are also each remarkably strong individually. However, Return of the Jedi often gets labelled ""the weaker one"" in the original film franchise. For the most part, arguments are made that it could've been better: It should've been the Wookies on Kashyyyk, not the Ewoks on Endor; the finale should've have been on the Galactic Capital Coruscant, not a rehashing of the Death Star, etc. It could've been better, but that is saying A LOT, because what we got was terrific in the end.",1
873,10.0,"This film is what I consider to be the best out of the entire ""Star Wars"" saga, and there are many reasons for this. First, even with another film after this, it still holds up as a conclusive ending to a franchise. Second, it is the most well written film, and yes, there are parts that aren't that good, but everything else makes up for it in the end. This also gave better character development for both Luke Skywalker, and the main villain Darth Vader. The portrayal of the Emperor is very evil and creepy, and no other villain in any other film had been portrayed like this. Even the controversial Special Edition of this is good, although it may still have flaws. The ending score at the end of the Special Edition to me is better than in the original, but the musical number in Jabba's palace would've been better if they had kept ""Lapti Nek"" and not added ""Jedi Rocks"". So on the whole, to me, this is the best film out of the entire Star Wars saga, and I will defiantly watch it right after I send this review.",1
874,7.0,"My favorite movie of the original trilogy. It feels much more personal and human than the first two, which were in my opinion primarily focused on space battles.",1
875,7.0,"I was not a fan of the series and never saw 'Empire', but I saw 'Jedi' when it came to Europe with my buddies Punky and Chewy. Back in those days Star Wars nerds mostly identified with Luke or Han and all loved the Princess, but Chewy identified with Chewbacca. Chewy may have been related to Chewbacca as he was tall and angular, had the same color hair with long bangs, glassy look in his eyes, not very verbal and would release mournful groans, but was a really good guy and was someone you'd want to go to battle with.",1
876,,"I know the Ewoks are too cute and cuddly, i know it isnt quite as consistent as The Empire Strikes Back, i know that at times its unrealistic but of the three its the only one i can still watch and not find slightly boring at times.  In the enhanced versions at the cinema this was the only one i could sit through without the slight feeling of dissatisfaction.  Its a couple of key scenes in the film which make it so great.  The Jabbas palace bit at the start of the film and the Throne room scenes at the end.  Its seeing the end result of how Luke has changed across the two previous films which i love; from a farm boy to the powerful warrior.  I don't think there's any call for another three sequels when Return of the Jedi finished it all with such a dramatic ending.",1
877,,"This is a strange movie that is the antithesis of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" While 'Empire' was dark and moody, ""Return of the Jedi"" is as light as a feather.  All of the tension and suspense of the last movie is gone here. The story moves more slowly, the character tension is mild and the overall mood is playful and goofy.  ""Jedi"" is pure fairytale, but unfortunately, the characters in the fable aren't very interesting.",0
878,10.0,"A wonderful conclusion to one of the most fascinating tales ever told. As dark as a tale can be, with an ending that may be happy yet it is very moving. I didn't like the extensive appearance of the Ewoks, but hey, it is a wonderful tale and tales have to be faerie :-)",1
879,,"I just finished watching this with my 6-year-old last night.  When I asked her what she thought of it, she said it was the story of how Darth Vader became good again.  I had never before realized just how right she was.  If one views the whole saga as the story arc of Anakin Skywalker, the title makes a lot more sense.  The pivotal moment of the series becomes when Darth Vader throws the Emperor down the shaft, as Anakin Skywalker redeems himself and returns (albeit posthumously) as a Jedi.  ",1

882,10.0,"The Original Trilogy couldn't have had a better ending. TESB is considered as the best Star Wars and I totally understand (one of my personal favorites as well). But ROTJ has that special epic-ending touch. You can feel the victory, how they're finally free in so many aspects such as literally free from the Empire or reedemed from their actions in the past and fulfilled destiny. Clear example of this is Vader and Luke. We can agree that this trilogy has the cliche plot of a hero about to go into an adventure and fuilfilling his unavoidable destiny. But the way this saga uses is so epic. To watch one of the best villains of all time find his redemption is so satisfying. You cannot see his face, and this makes it even more amazing to understand the character. Just feel the character. See that behind allthat black suit and mask there's a reaaly good person that got his point of view blurred by a bad choice.<br /><br />All this along with the master John Williams on the score...pffff...EPIC. There are a lot of underestimated pieces in this movie such as the one played during Vader and Luke's final duel. This song is literally tellling you that this is the one scene that will define once and for all the destiny of the Force. But it also tells you all the conflict that is going between father and son. And even though the lightsaber duels in the latest movies have a lot much more of acrobatics and action, I'll keep with this duel as my favorite one. Visually and emotionally is breathtaking. The green and red clashing in the dark backgroundis visually epic.",1
883,10.0,"Not to get into the whole ""Clerks"" which movie was better argument here, but I always liked ""Return of The Jedi"" better then ""Empire Strikes Back"". The reason I love ""Jedi"" is that within this film you get everything that you saw in the first two within one movie. The amazing opening act at Jabba's palace and the skiff battle. Luke becoming a Jedi master on Degobah. Then the amazing third act. Luke and Vader's final battle, the battle on Endor with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Ewoks against the storm troopers. And of course in my opinion the greatest space battle of the Star Wars saga. I remember when I was a little kid, watching that space battle and how I was amazed by it. That was one of the first great movie experiences for me as a movie lover. ""Return of the Jedi"" is everything you could ever want in a Star Wars movie, but beyond that everything you could want in a truly great movie.",1
884,9.0,"When I was about 10, I use to think that ROTJ was the best movie of all time, why was that? Cos I thought the last 40 minutes or so was so cool. But 9 year later my option is a lot different. 40 minutes does not make a movie. I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing. Maybe it's the Ewoks that were just in it for merchandising and I think that did let the film down a bit. Like you go from Empire which is really dark to teddy bears running around killing stormtroopers. Sorry, but it's too unbelievable. Another thing I haven't understood is the Space Battle. When The Rebels come out of Hyperspace I reckon there's probably about 15 capital ships at most. Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed. Then as the falcon has blown up the death star u see about 30 rebel capital ships flying away from it...sorry if u think I am being picky but there are a lot of flaws here. I can understand if people get bored of the movie for awhile. It starts of slow and after killing jabba too the last 40 minutes it's quite slow. Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5.",1
885,,"Although we all can poke a little fun at the Ewoks and the muppet type characters throughout the movie, and they are a little too fluffy and fun loving for the Star Wars genre, the very ending was about the only way the story could end.  I think all great stories are built on characters and personalities, and Star Wars certainly is built on the duality of the good guys vs. the bad guys, but redemption is vital to this one very much.",1

889,9.0,"Of the original trio this is the second strongest movie. I could've done without the EWOKS, as it just seemed a bit too silly. But overall the action was first rate and the final fight scene between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely riveting. I'm a bit weird so did not appreciate the desperate and overlydone attempt at the end to redeem Vader. Hollywood seems scared to create great evil characters, once a fan base starts to build they seem determined to redeem them somehow. Still despite the ending and the Ewoks I gave this 9 out of 10, very enjoyable, a lot of fun.",1

Like the rest of the previous Star Wars films, Return of the Jedi was an entertaining movie but in my opinion not as good as the previous 2 films in the original trilogy. Return of the Jedi lacked story with it's continuation plot. The whole story in the film was just finishing the conflict that was unsolved in the Empire Strikes Back and also just finishing the original trilogy by solving the conflict in the complete trilogy. Besides the not so strong plot, Return of the Jedi is visually breathtaking with it's beautiful art direction and set designs. Return of the Jedi also is very exciting with the amazing special effects and battle scenes. So in conclusion to my review, Return of the Jedi is a very fun to watch film but it's just not as great as the previous 2 films in the original trilogy.",1
892,10.0,"This is the movie that turned my world upside down!! I am an absolute Star Wars geek!! I have a huge collection of figures and even a tattoo of the Imperial logo on my leg. Return of the Jedi is what grabbed me and pulled me into the Star Wars galaxy. I absolutely loved this movie growing up. It's definitely my favorite Star Wars film. Empire is a close second though. The only thing that drives me nuts about the movies is when George Lucas had to ""touch it up"" and he added that horrendous redone band scene in jabbas palace. Every time I see that it makes me cringe. Other than that hands down best Star Wars movie ever and definitely the best fiction ever!!! The Star Wars galaxy is one of the greatest things ever created for sci-fi dudes!!",1
893,9.0,"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is simply put a success, and the perfect ending to the greatest trilogy of all time. People complain constantly about how ewoks are a simple marketing campaign, but they are a needed value in this equations masterpiece. Yoda, was a tiny green creature who upon first glance, was nothing but. Yet upon greater inspection, he was the Grand Master of the Jedi. It's the little things that matter, and can overall make a difference. And return of the Jedi shows us this, with its inclusion. Making the presence of ewoks, not so much a scheme, but more essential than anything. And without homage to Yoda and this lesson, it would have been a lesson without anything learned. Without this contrast of something lighter, the movie is grueling with darkness. Luke heads to defeat his Father, and his Fathers master,on a suicide mission. Where he knows might be his final stand. We have the Emperor, a man consumed in evil, who is stopped by his agent of evil, Darth Vader. Showing the audience a great darkness taken down, with both the emperor dead, and the switch to light for Darth Vader.In the end, It sums up the monumental trilogy, and creates a great movie while doing so!",1

896,7.0,"Until the release of the Phantom Menace, Return of the Jedi was widely regarded as the worst Star Wars film. Topping the awesome Empire Strikes back was always going to be difficult but on some levels Jedi suceeds. With all the plot threads left dangling at the climax of the previous film there was always going to be a degree of exposition in this film yet George Lucas and Richard Marquand managed to keep the pace of the movie at a ridiculous level. Mark Hamil by this time has grown into the character of Luke Skywalker and easily walks away with the acting honours, easily outshining a seemingly bored Harrison Ford and strangely enjoying a better chemistry with Carrie Fisher than his costar. The Star Wars movies have always been associated with outstanding special effects and again we are not disappointed - the climactic battle over Endor still holds its own by todays standards. If you can forgive the inclusion of the ewoks then Return of the Jedi stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best space operas around, and makes a satisfying final installment in the original trilogy.",1
897,9.0,"This is the most amazing trilogy, i have ever seen. I don't know where i am start. First of all, it is unbelievable that these movies were performed in 80s. Screenplay, effects were amazing. Acting is already great. I have first decided to watch this trilogy, i postponed it always because of the comments of people around me. But when i watched it, i regretted very much. I think everyone must watch this films very quickly. Second of all, when you watch it, you realized that the other films and PC games were originated from this trilogy. Countless films performed after this trilogy has carried something from this trilogy. First film (Star Wars : A New Hope) and the second one (Star Wars : Empire Strikes Back) have left many questions. But the last film (star wars: return of the Jedi) has answered all of them , i think:",1

Technology Freak?! I must admit there are some glorious moments still, Jabbas Gang war, Yoda's Death, Aniken Reveals himself emotionally, and the the special effects improvement from the first two movies!

The ending is just perfect. Also, the music is the best from the Trilogy, adding depth to the characters and underscoring their development. Arguably, John Williams did his best work here.

You can feel the hate and anger building up in Luke as he gets closer and closer to falling into the dark side.  The music in the last light saber battle between Luke and Darth is superb, it just adds to the intensity.

Just think of how 4,5,&6 would have came out if they did them in the 2000s. Yes I know that it would not have been the same because the actors that made the 70s and 80s movies made it great. However, I was just thinking that all the electronics that they used then would have been better with the current electronics they have today.

The Emperor is somewhat an original character. I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga. In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls. I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor. Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and...his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. I felt there was much more than meets the eye. And as always the John William's music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe.",1

923,7.0,"Luke's allegorical phantom confrontation with Vader on Dagobah, the revelatory confrontation between the two on Bespin, and the drama of Solo's being frozen in carbonite set Empire above the other two in the original trilogy.  Empire puts flesh on the mythic bones presented in Star Wars, which is remarkable for the simplicity of its story -- a farm boy, a mercenary and an elder knight rescue a princess from a dark castle and dark lord, then return to disintegrate it!  Return of the Jedi perhaps had the easiest task of the three and did well for the most part.  The great escape from Jabba's sail barge is tremendous fun, if somewhat improbable (specifically, that Luke could foresee where R2 would be in relation to him to propel his new lightsaber to him; but that's the Force -- excuse me, talking bacteria in our blood now, after Episode I).  And the slow, sinister game of cat and mouse in the Emperor's throne room -- between the Emperor, then Vader, and Luke -- elegantly deadly with the iridescent arcs of lightsabers in the darkness, provided a triumphant close.  It was just the Ewoks that brought down an otherwise incredible second sequel.  Cuteness only goes so far when one is trying to portray a struggle for the fate of the galaxy; and unfortunately, Mr. Lucas succumbs again in Phantom Menace. Why, why would one use obviously phony aliens with terrible mock-Asian accents when the stern Englishmen aboard the Death Star in Star Wars performed so well and painted the Empire as a bland, starched, strict entity that -- with the Stormtroopers -- clearly evoked the Nazi regime?  Now we have Jar Jar and his silly tribe and a two-headed pod-racing/basketball analyst; and to make matters worse and as I mentioned before, Mr. Lucas has flayed the flesh from those mythic bones by reducing the Force to something that characters can only feel because of a strain of bacteria in them.  Not the mind, not the soul or will -- bacteria.  Superintelligent bacteria, no doubt, and wise enough to engineer a virgin birth (!?) at just the right time and place in the story's timeline; but still, changing the touchstone of the Force from humanity to bacteria was a poor, poor decision.  Episode I is a visual delight, the lightsaber duels light-years beyond those in the original trilogy; but the original had magic.  And that, I hope Mr. Lucas will understand, is something that all of the digital effects and funny, diverse aliens in the universe cannot replace.  The relevance of this long tangent, then, is that it enables me to say this:  when Return of the Jedi ends, as flames dance before Luke and consume his father's bier, cleansing the black armor and rising into the night, as John Williams' powerful composition presents the Force theme one final, stirring time, there is magic; there is myth and the closing of a cycle.  Treasure it, but keep what comes ""after"" separate -- in a galaxy far, far away. (Of course, it may be that Episodes II and III are able to find the magic again; the great questions remain unanswered:  why did Anakin turn?  how was his body shattered then armored?  I hold out that hope; 5 of 6 would be remarkable. Time will tell.)",0
924,,"The Good: Fabulous job from supporting cast.  Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor is terrifying despite repetitive dialogue.  Billy Dee Williams retains some edge from ""Empire"" despite his role being watered down in the script to someone less hardbitten.  Denis Lawson is great as always as Wedge. I *love* Mon Mothma and Admiral Ackbar.",1
925,10.0,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie. I know that a lot of fans say that it is the worst of the old movies. But I disagree. As a space opera as Star Wars really is, this movie is perfect. The weird kind of hidden humor in it is fantastic, and the way Mark Hammil portray Luke becomming a Jedi is also great. It also have the best opening scene I've ever seen. The hole thing at Jabba's place is just great. It has nothing special to do with the plot, but it still takes a great deal of time, typically space opera. Anyway, I won't write more because there are probably zounds of other post out there that you want to read.",1
926,7.0,"this is the worst part of the original trilogy... it isn´t even better than episode 1, but still like any star wars film it has classic moments... which strangely all include the emperor, the rest of the charachters are just not convincing. han solo is not as witty as he´s in the other ones, lea not as energic, luke and darth vader are just whining all the time and damn those *%&$#% ewoks... why george? why? ""the kids love them!""",0
927,10.0,"The return of the Jedi will always be my favorite of all the Star Wars movies.  Though you can never forget the revolutionary steps taken w/ Star Wars, Episode IV, it is certainly the most fun of all those yet made. Luke is finally a Jedi, and from childhood so many of us will remember the thrill we got, especially from the first section at Jaba the Hut's.",1
928,,"I was looking over the original theatrical posters of the films and think that the Return of the Jedi poster is my favorite. I really like the top half of the Empire Strikes Back poster but the bottom is all ice and while its great with the top, definitely setting the tone and feeling of the picture it is only ice. The ROJ poster uses more then half the space and fills it well. I especially like the stairs leading up to Vader and the two ships aimed at his head are a nice touch. And Princess Leia does look sexy between the opposing forces. So any thoughts? Which poster you like best? It you don't remember what they look like the Wikipedia pages have them.",1
929,3.0,"I'm not sure who should be blamed for this disaster of a movie, it's either the director or the writer...oh wait, they're both Rian Johnson. Maybe it's Disney's fault for hiring him. Or, maybe it's George Lucas for selling his franchise to Disney (hard to blame him though - $4 billion). Rian Johnson either hates Star Wars or just has a complete disregard for the fans. It is so different that it doesn't feel connected to the saga at all. The characters seem different and there is a blatant disregard for the importance of continuity within the star wars universe. This is the second of three new star wars films. The first, the force awakens, set the stage with some exciting new characters and stories. Poe Dameron is a studly x-wing pilot. Rey is a young scavenger on Tatooine with a mysterious past. Finn is a runaway Storm Trooper and potential love interest of Rey. Kylo Ren is the grandson of Darth Vader and has turned to the dark side. Snoke is an evil leader of the First Order and possibly Sith Lord more powerful than the Emperor from the last trilogy. Best of all, the first movie ends with Rey meeting Luke Skywalker and presenting him with his first lightsaber which he lost when his hand was severed by Darth Vader in the Empire Strikes Back. With eager anticipation, we waited for this next movie to see Luke again and discover the answer to many of these new mysteries. During this break between the movies, a fan made a short movie and posted it on youtube called the legend of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber. This short video had me pumped about the Last Jedi. Unfortunately, hopes were dashed. We are taken back to the scene as Rey and Luke meet. He takes the lightsaber from Rey, looks at it, and tosses it over his shoulder like a piece of trash. Don't get me started on how Rian character assassinates Luke Skywalker and turns him into a crotchety old dude who just wants to die and let the entire Jedi Order die with him. As the movie plays out, none of the mysteries from the first film are answered. Who are Rey's parents? What about Snoke? Not only do we not find out if Snoke is a Sith lord, he dies faster and easier than the average stormtrooper. What about Luke's battle with the Knights of Ren? Or for that matter, who are the Knights of Ren? What about the love story between Rey and Finn? They barely have screen time together in this film. Why is the studly Poe Dameron now an insubordinate punk? Are you starting to understand why Rian Johnson received so many death threats? Still, in true Star Wars form, most of the action scenes are exciting and the lightsaber fights are intense and dramatic. And, the special effects are very well-done, making for some visually compelling set and character designs. While The Last Jedi doesn't come close to the standard that's been set by previous Star Wars films, it's entertaining and moves the saga forward (barely).",0
930,9.0,Return of the Jedi is a fun action packed movie that is great for people of all ages.,1
931,9.0,"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.",0
932,10.0,"I was watching the Siskel & Ebert special as to why Star Wars is considered so successful, and no one said it right better than these two late critics. What better way to innovate storytelling, along with filmmaking, than to mix the elements of old mythologies with new technologies. This film is a pure example of that blend. To have such large scale planetary visages in shots, the hundreds of ships zigzagging through space, the montage of creatures in the lair of Jabba the Hutt, and the excellently choreographed hand-to-hand fights. While some people claim this film is not as good as the previous two entries, I disagree. This film brought the whole series full circle, and ended it on a note that's not seen with most trilogies.

935,8.0,"George Lucas's need for a celebration scene at the end of the greatest movie trilogy of all time, has for me marred the third (or should I say 6th?) installment. If, after the funeral pyre scene where Luke is burning Darth Vader's body, and the camera pans up to the stars, if the film finished there, this film would have scored a 10 from me. But unfortunately we get Ewoks playing drums with the empty helmets of stormtroopers, and everybody generally frolicking about. The same with Phantom Menace, end the film after the camera sweeps to Palpatine looking into the fire, a great place to leave everybody wondering what is going to happen next. Instead we get the gungan parade. Ho hum, hopefully George will not have a corny celebration scene at the end of Episode 2, but I doubt it.",0
936,7.0,"This movie is iconic and deserves its spot among the best of the Star Wars movies; but a lot of the movie isn't very interesting, especially the beginning and some of the time spent on Endor. The action is entertaining, and the characters are great; Darth Vader remains possibly the greatest villain in cinematic history, and Luke Skywalker one of the greatest heroes. The cinematography is great - just as great as in the previous two movies. The soundtrack adds layers to some the more important scenes in the movie - particularly those dealing with the emotions of the characters.",1
937,10.0,"This is definitely one of the best films ever made and a treasure of American film-making. Never in any other series was the character development dialogue special effects or any other element of film-making so perfect. This movie contains more memorable quotes than probably all other Hollywood movies combined. Too bad not too many filmmakers follow George's formula of action, special effects, dialogue and over all quality. It has at least traces of a forgotten art in movie making that I hope makes a come back -- character development If you haven't seen this movie see it, it is the third best movie ever made of course, behind ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"". If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't experienced film and art at its peak.",1
938,10.0,Star Wars EpisodeIV Return of the Jedi is the best movie I have ever seen its also my favirote the best part is where Luke`s anger takes control of him when Vader is talking about how Luke`s thoughts betrayed his sister and she might turn to the dark side the saddest part is when Luke took of Vader`s mask  I`m the worlds greatest star wars fan thanks to this movie I LOVE star wars episodeIV,1
939,10.0,"OK, I am going to catch heat for saying this..but this is my FAVORITE movie in the franchise. Now before anybody loses their minds based on what I've just said, please allow me to explain. First off, I love four out of the six Star Wars movies made...yes, four. But the reason this one is so close to my heart is because there is so much depth and cinematography in this film. first off, there is very little, but also very much change to characters in this episode. Obviously, Luke Skywalker being the main example of character progression throughout the series. In this film, he finally embraces the way of the Jedi and at the same time, carries many qualities of a Sith as well. He does have anger and hate, and that is what drives him to the conclusion of this movie, and that is what I love about it. Also, the progression of the relationship between Han and Leigha..absolutely amazing. You literally cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about that romantic side of the story. And it is perfectly revealed in this movie. Yes, it may not be the best written of the episodes, or even the best film of the episodes, but the elements within the film are enough to warrant this film a perfect 10/10.",1
940,10.0,I think the Return of the Jedi is the best of all the Star Wars films. But since i have not seen Episode 3 i still don't think that it will be better then what i call the greatest of all films. Return Of the Jedi,1

942,10.0,"In my opinion, best of all Star Wars movies so far, including Episode VII, which was very good, but would not consider it better than Episode VI, which goes par with Episode V. It's really hard to compare any other movie that can contain action scenes, drama, and unexpected turns better than this movie. I have watched it multiple times to the point where I know every line in the movie (also with episodes IV and V). Can't say the same for Episodes I - III, quite honestly they fall behind any of these 3, and also Episode VII, which felt like a remake of Episode IV for a new generation. Not bad at all, although was expecting a bit more original story.",1
943,10.0,"basically, this was the best movie of the series in my opinion. Sure it didn't have character development, but thats because, in general, if you are wrapping up a trilogy the characters were set in the first two, so you don't go and spend time one developing characters. Which leaves for dialogue, which was probably the funniest one-liners of the series. There were some dark moments and yet the ewoks' presence countered that keeping it watchable and not over-bearing. Special effects were also at their best in this movie as well. George Lucas provided a script that was fun for everyone to watch and yet also serious enough for this trilogy to conclude and several years later to begin again. Overall the best in my opinion. -mike",1
944,8.0,"I thought the Vader star destroyer space shuttle thing was great!! However, I also think that they could have done away with those stupid, squeaky, annoying Ewoks! If anything spoilt that film for me, it was them. I mean, they were brave little fighters and all that, but they were - and come on lets admit this - annoying!! As for the plot, yeah, i agree, it was just like the first film. Maybe they could have come up with a bit of a different idea than another Death Star (Yawn!) For Heaven's sake! Didn't they learn their lesson in the first place. And anyway, whenever Darth Vader let the shuttle land on the moon of Endor, he knew he was in for it.",0
945,10.0,"return of the Jedi is my favorite out of the series because it s the best trilogy ending ever in my opinion it ends in the best way possible i loved it i mean Vader's dead i hated all of George Lucas is changes in the special edition. Now George Lucas screwed a LOT of things up in the special edition,blue ray and DVD but this one is the worst things changed but..... it is still enjoyable i mean Luke still becomes a Jedi master Yoda die Vader dies Luke's light sabers green Emporer dies so this is still an ENJOYABLE MOVIE !. now people say that return of the Jedi is the worst out of the original s i defiantly disagree it is one of the most ENJOYABLE! MOVIES! i have ever seen . now there are some bad things about the special edition such as changing the end ghost of Sebastian Shaw to Hayden Christensen and the song at the end and the Jabbas palace seen and when they changed the giant monster in that hole and the giant hole alone but it is still a 10/10 for me",1
946,9.0,"I was wondering. If Vader's life was dependent on his life support system and a few seconds of force lightning messed that up and killed him, then why didn't any of his 'followers' (And I'm sure many wanted to commit regicide on their leader) use the same trick on him. They knew he was on life support (right?), the breathing surely showed some signs, and It wasn't fatigue(Vader doesn't move often) or heavy smoking so they could've killed him if they wanted to, with any source of electrical current? (I'm overdoing it here I know but it's a valid point right?) Your humble opinions (and please make jokes,the subject deserves it';)",1
947,10.0,"SPOILERS AHEAD! This movie was quite good. This is just amazing! A movie in that years, that was sooo good, like many others. The technology was really developed at the time, and Lucas' imagination is so big! So, what I noticed now... Luke did not bring the balance to the Force. And this is strange to you, huh? He just helped. The real Chosen One was Anakin Skywalker, who was chosen by Qui-Gon Jin. Qui- Gon new that he will defeat the Emperor, and he didn't tell Obi-Wan what he probably knew. Anakin Skywalker was fighting like a real Jedi, until the Revenge of The Sith, when he wanted to save Padme. But, the Emperor killed her, wanting Vader to be alone. But, I think he always thought of her, even in his robotic years. When Luke was tortured, Vader became more humane. So... He killed the Emperor. He is the only Chosen One. He finished the job, the dark side lost. That would be my review!",1
948,10.0,This is by far in my opinion the best Star Wars movie. Actually I started reading the comics: 'Shadows of the Empire'; which tells you everything about Jabba the Hutt and Why Leia wheres the costume etc. etc. So for all of you who wanna know more. I can recommend you the comic book series. I think if you live in America they are just a few dollars on Ebay!,1
949,9.0,"I will do this review simple. It had great special effects for the epoch, I must admit. I enjoyed this movie so much when I was little, and until now I remember the emotion I lived when I saw it. The fierce battles, the hope the protagonists had. Their emotions were easy to see, how they reacted against the Empire's attacks. Yet, the young Jedi was able to confront them, and finish all this universal war, thanks to his bond with his father, a bond too hard to break, not even the Emperor could. You can also experience the war with other living thins, like the wookies, something we can out in real life: we as humans, needed the animals for wars and battles, and now, is very helpful for our alimentation. There are many other things we can get from all the franchise, but it is up to you if you want to watch it. Yet, I highly recommend to see this fantastic movie, there will have some feelings and emotions that will go through you. You will love the movies, I can tell you from my personal experience.",1

However, after seeing Episode 3, I have a question regarding a conversation between Luke and Leia in Episode 6. I believe Luke asks Leia about their mother and she replies (misquote) ""she was beautiful, but sad"". Is Leia referring to their real mom, Padme? And if so, is that possible, being that Padme died in childbirth? Again, I am sure that many avid Star Wars fans know distinct details that I may have missed, but this one thing just stuck out to me. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",1

This film was released in June 2, 1983 which is in the UK. This film was directed by Richard Marquand. When they filmed this film they had a budget which was 32.5 million USD.

952,10.0,"A couple of weeks ago I had (again) the opportunity to see this epic movie on a big screen in the famous Concertgebouw in Amsterdam with the music being played by the Residentie Orkest. I agree with some critics that the first part of the movie is not the most dynamical part. But during the last 40 minutes or so you don't get bored for one second and the orchestra keeps playing the magnificent music from John Williams without one break. The tension and action are unbelievable. Having seen this movie numerous times my focus was on the music and this was so rewarding. I'm a fan of Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev.... and this music is at the same level. It's really hard and difficult for the trumpets and horns with lots of power and high notes. The music in the delicate passages (death of Yoda and during the episode of the cremation of Darth Vader) is very challenging for the first horn. You recognize some themes who are repeated, but every time with a different nuance, keeping it interesting. This one and The Empire Strikes Back are probably the greatest achievements ever in the combination of script, execution and music.",1
