0,9.0,"I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.",1
1,10.0,"Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.",1
2,8.0,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",1
3,7.0,"This movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.",1
4,,"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!",1
5,8.0,"While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichés and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking.",1
6,10.0,"At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world...",1
7,10.0,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!",1
8,7.0,"Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.",1
9,9.0,I saw this at a preview screening in London.,0
10,,"Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of ""The Two Towers"" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director.",0
11,10.0,"An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. ",1
12,8.0,"Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",1
13,9.0,"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.",1
14,10.0,"In the beginning, I want to thank the author j.k.

16,10.0,"The plot is very original and incredible, I think it is one of the best film ever. IF you love fantasy movies you should watch this. The cast is excellent, I love Emma Watson in this movie, she plays very well. In my opinion, this movie is the best adventure movie in the world because the plot is really awesome. Thank you JK Rowling and Steve Naves !<br /><br />The special effects are incredible and the soundtrack epic. I think it the greatest movie. It lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes but it is not boring. Even is you don't like drama, adventure and Fantasy movies, you must watch this one, it will change your opinion.",1
17,10.0,"This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",1
18,6.0,Everything that could have been said about this movie has probably been said.,0
19,,"OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.",0
20,5.0,Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.,0
21,10.0,Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10,1
22,10.0,"Harry Potter is one of my favorite childhood movies ever. I discovered my passion for films and movies by watching these and I still adore all of them. There's absolutely no doubt about it. I always have an interest about the kind of movies I like. So, Harry Potter has been quite a journey. Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have been awesome from start to finish. These are the best memories that I can keep on forever. This is a lifetime movie. It brings adventure, travel, humor, sports, and a spectacular epic soundtrack and storyline throughout this whole process of filmmaking. There's also a sense of generosity and above all love. So, I'd highly recommend watching the movie saga.",1
23,9.0,"While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.",1
24,10.0,"Fifteen years of tireless, incredible hard work from some of the best of Britain's storytelling talent, supported by an equally faithful and eagerly devoted fan base, now culminates in the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result. ",1
25,6.0,"I don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.",1

All three principal actors have grown much in the ten years of films. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter faces severe facts that could be fatal. In fact, a major plus here is how Potter is placed in a battle situation where he appears to have lost. Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron have been Potter's friends and companions through every film and thankfully the film ties off their romantic feelings without stooping to Twilight level. Then we have Ralph Finnes as Voldemort, one of the most evil presence in films. There is no remorse. He will destroy even his own in order to conquer. The secret involve the wand he possesses is another highlight revelation. Voldemort is historically the murderer of Harry's parents. Now they clash wands in what will appear as if Voldemort will dominate. When he utters a victorious laugh, he doesn't realize that he hasn't thought of everything. Alan Rickman has played Professor Snape in all of the films but here he is at his best, particularly when certain facts surface. David Yates returns as director after having made The Deathly Hallows, Part 1, as well as entries The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince. These films were always pointless entertainment but with such enchanting visuals, it concludes with as much magic as it begun. Score: 7 / 10",1

They have also become extremely dark, with the 'love will triumph over evil' moral and the never-truly-threatening bad guys of the early two films being replaced with murdered house elves, tortured children, mass murder, and main characters being mercilessly killed in the blink of an eye.

58,,"So now we reach the end of Harry Potter and the Tortuously Extended Franchise with the final installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing. Who is at fault? Certainly not the actors young and old who give very serviceable performances despite, in most cases, being given next to nothing to do. Director David Yates can manage some serviceable pacing when he needs to. I rather think that the fault lies less with an unimaginative director than with the author and producers of whom Rowling was one. Ultimately I attribute this film's failings, as I did in Part I, to greed. Deathly Hallows, Parts I & II might make a very good 2 and a half to 3 hour movie. Instead they combine to form a deadly dull 4 hour and 36 minute snoozer. Take just 1 scene as an example. Harry, on his way to confront Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone, one of the Deathly Hallows that he obtained in the preceding film. The ensuing scene is utterly superfluous. It does nothing but slow the action. At a moment when we need desperately to get on to the confrontation we are stuck with a convocation that does not include all the people who have been closest to Harry and spends minutes that pass like hours in soulful looks and some babble that we and Harry all knew already. It is a waste of celluloid or disc space or whatever medium is appropriate at the moment. Even Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are given precious little to do in this film but I'm not sure that is a fault as much as I enjoy their acting. This film is, after all the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, the moment toward which we've built over the 7 previous films. It's more than time to focus on Harry and Voldemort to the exclusion of most of the rest of the cast. Still, that's not what we get. We get much tying up of loose ends with interjected back stories that only contribute to the deathly pacing. We learn things that we should have learned in Half-Blood Prince and several other movies. Though those interjections may have been part of the 7th book they simply interfere with action of this film. We also get boxcar loads of exposition to explain plot twists for which no one ever laid the prior groundwork. The movie is a mess that completes the story but becomes a disservice to to the actors and fans. At one point late in the film Maggie Smith's Prof. McGonagall casts a weary, quizzical look in medium close up that seems more to say, ""What am I doing here if not for the paycheck and how fast can I get back to the set of Downton Abbey where I actually can display my talent and craft."" I feel for her. I do blame the directors to some extent but the producers and J. K. Rowling even more. From the start of the series the money people made great casting decisions and then put their wonderful actors in the hands of hacks like Chris Columbus and David Yates while giving fine directors like Alfonso Cuaron the boot after a single episode. Perhaps, one day once J. K. Rowling passes on to some other worldly Enchanted Forest, someone really competent who loves the stories will hire an elderly Daniel Radcliffe to play Albus Dumbledore in a really good remake of the series. I surely hope Harry Potter gets better treatment one day. He deserves it though he didn't get it here.",0

60,10.0,"The movie is the greatest and best part of the series for me. The action scenes in the movie were amazing and were better than the rest of the parts by a large margin. The story of the movie was less than the level of the previous part. The movie contained many nonsensical scenes such as Harry breaking the most powerful magic wand in the world for no reason, Daniel Radcliffe's acting greatly improved from the rest of the parts, the movie answered many of my questions perfectly.",1
61,8.0,"For many fans (and let me get this out now: I am one of them), this is  much more than just another film in the franchise: it's the it's the  end of an era, or simply the end of a journey which lasted for over 10  years (14 if you count the first book, back in 1997). There are no  precedents like this in movie history... There's a certain poignancy  that comes with it, because, as we all know, this is the last one EVER.  There will not be any other Harry Potter, no matter what. The film  clearly knows all that and consciously plays to it, tapping into our  deepest-self, reminding us about this journey we've taken and how we've  grown up with it.   The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own  voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of  magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso  Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to  the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and  book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces  the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly  after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything  out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch  the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem  greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box  office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).  Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like  this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of  bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of  course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the  disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would  like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never  please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner  Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been  handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares  for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make,  playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source  and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film  must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain,  taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.  And you know what? My heart can't stop saying ""I just loved the  journey, thank you so much for it",1
62,10.0,The brilliant series ends with a brilliance. Harry's death at the hands of Voldemort and his coming to life again; the secret about Severus; the bravery of Longbottom; the demise of Fred; the sharpness of mind of Luna and many more to mention. All the knots tied from the first part are opened and what can the viewer want more. Direct encounter between Harry and Voldemort at the end and Harry throwing the Elder wand at the end gives a true meaning as Harry does not run for the quest of power. The lesson given to his son over election to Slytherin is also worth noting. The series ends but with the hope of coming back with another story. Good bye Hogwartz.,1
63,10.0,One of the best series I've ever seen with an amazing conclusion.. A bit emotional saying goodbye to all the characters after 10 years.,1
64,8.0,"I was right! The Harry Potter theme's pretty much non-existent at the beginning of this final film in the series (though we still float through the WB logo/film title). Unfortunately, we have to trudge through a recapping of where the previous film finished and some painfully slow exchanges with Olivander and a backstabby goblin. Yes, let's waste time on slow-talking/pointless moments of silence, movie (especially when you have the shortest runtime of the whole series)! Thankfully, things improve when Hermione assumes Bellatrix Lestrange's form so they can break into her vault. Wonderful Helena Bonham Carter doesn't get much to say/do in this film, but she makes up for it by perfectly capturing the facial expressions/demeanor of Hermione awkwardly pretending to be the complete opposite of herself. It's some nice humour in an otherwise pretty serious film.",0
65,4.0,"I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution. ",1
66,4.0,"I found other comments from boards and posts around the net, I found that I agree with all of them. I'm a fan of the books and Yates ruined the franchise. He sucked out all of the magic and unnecessarily changed key parts of the story or left them out all together.",1
67,10.0,"Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?",1
68,8.0,"Knowing in advance both how the story goes (and with J K Rowling on board as a co- producer, that it wasn't going to be changed much) and naturally how it ends, it was incumbent on Peter Yates to nonetheless deliver the big finish to Harry's adventures and in particular his final showdown with Voldemort. I wasn't disappointed and in the end had only minor quibbles about the resolution.",0
69,10.0,"So this is it, one of the most beloved series of all time has come to a close. You know I was starting to wonder if summer blockbusters were just tired of having some kind of story, great acting and substance. Harry Potter changed all that, not to mention it was a breath of fresh air that kids wanted to read again. I did not read the books as Harry Potter wasn't the type of genre I would ever read but I did watch the movies to see what all the hype was about. I've always been very pleased with watching these movies, they're very satisfying, between the effects and the story and growing up with these actors, everything has just been great. The Deathly Hallows was split into two parts as it's a very long book and I'm sure they wanted to get in every detail for the fans. The last Harry Potter, while it was a good movie, it felt like it was a little boring at certain times for me. I haven't seen these films so close together and haven't read the books to know everything they are talking about so it was hard to keep up on certain parts. But this conclusion blew every one of the Harry Potter movies out of the water and had a great conclusion with a tear jerker ending.",1

However, I am glad that we always had to consciously approach the fact of its existence. Much has happened over the years. For some of us have been ups and downs in relation to the part of Harry Potter, for someone not. We are alone. Such stories - only a sign of how this loneliness we are trying to escape. When there is that it is able to unite us, and the same eyes we are able to watch the same story. Harry and his friends always reminded very much of themselves, because of two things - simplicity and good nature. Also, like any other person, we grow, mature, and it all happens under the influence of other factors. We observe and listen, exactly the same as the one when a little boy, in the course of years became a man. He had fears, and there were mysteries. He sought to solve them, and overcome all sorts of difficulties. He was tough, and friends were always glad to help. Is this not a reflection of our life in certain stages of her? Istoriya3D finally reached the tipping point that, when there was absolutely no childhood, and adulthood appeared views of the surrounding events.

81,8.0,"What am I doing writing a review for, possibly, the most highly anticipated series finale-8 years after its debut?",1
82,,"When something great comes to a end you can't help, but feel a certain level of sadness. The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it.",1
83,6.0,"(Read PS first, if you please.) This final HP halfway makes it. Yes, we all love HP. Yes, all the films have been done with great style. Still, there was an onus on DH2, and Yates (and screenplay) miss here and there. - On the plus side, Radcliffe finally becomes a real actor. - On the plusser side, Rickman is BRILLIANT and he was robbed of a supporting Oscar. - Bad news (and, as with other quibbles, the movies should stand independently from the books): Bellatrix. She is equal to Vol in sheer evil, and she is grossly responsible for many gleeful murders and tortures. It's fine to have Molly kill her, but the moment was far, far too brief. This needed to be real revenge, to satisfy fans so hating of LeStrange. - The Kings Cross limbo. Egad. I know it's in the book, I know Albus needs to redeem himself to Harry, but the device was annoying and trite. - The Ravenclaw ghost scene was far too protracted. Yes, there had to be suspense about getting this horcrux, but it felt overdone. - Dumbledore's mysterious past and hunger for power: why allude to it strongly, then leave nothing answered? It was like the Bagstock presence in DH1. We movie watchers knew it was important, but the film did not clarify how. - Finally, the end. In LOTR, Jackson understood the audience needed to hear Frodo stop in wonderment, that the ring was gone. Same thing. When the 3 friends are kicking stones around, there had to be SOME expression relating that a vast doom that's haunted them all (and the world) was gone. Not too much, mind you, but some astonishment from Harry, certainly. - Epilogue. So, it was all about the kids? Generation Next? How dull. Better to have only referred to Harry's naming his son after Severus, which was right and touching. PS More bad: how, if you don't read the book, can you rationalize Harry being alive after the forest? All we know is The Vol throws the killing spell, not the kill-unintentional-horcrux spell. Also - far too much of gratuitous, aimless running around of students during and before the battle. Seriously. These kids all acted like they had no idea of what was going on, and were utterly defenseless. Oh, yes: the script itself. It's pretty weak. Maybe Neville's awful speech is how teens talk, but this needed to be stunning, not trite. PS Read the books. Egad. Makes Helena Ravenclaw's ghost worse here, and why on earth is she referring to a 'boy' who wanted to destroy the diadem in the past, when there was no need to destroy it before Riddle, the boy, got it to begin with? Lots of mistakes now really glaring, and the lamest part of the film is that it fails to explain Harry's sacrifice properly, as it echoed his mother's. WHY, oh, why, did they not want the tension of the final duel in the film, and that wonderful bit with Harry calling V by his real name, and schooling him? This humiliation of V then makes his quick death all right. I know a film must make changes, but to ignore the very best of the book is just plain criminal.",0

The fact that everything the previous films set up comes to a conclusion and that the film is also not burdened by setting future films makes this great! Also, it has the best story, acting, visual effects, storytelling, and twists, particularly that of Snape's past. If one rewatches the entire series with knowledge of Snape's past, Rickman's performance makes a lot of sense. (ALAN RICKMAN IS GREAT HERE!)

And now nine years later, after I've read all the books and seen all previous movies, it was time to finish this. Movie started very good. It started just, where the first part ended.

They put 95% of the focus onto Harry and let all of the other characters fall by the wayside, so when major emotional peaks happened like the Hermoine and Ron kiss that had been building for eight entire films, it became this throwaway moment that had no significance. This happened a good dozen or so times throughout the film with moments that were supposed to be huge emotional payoffs and ended up just feeling like footnotes on ""The Harry Story"" for two hours.",0

The book had a rather good plot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to include any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that had nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other parts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and simply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all.

Rowling's wizarding laws are completely decimated. Since when did Harry start 'sensing' horcruxes? Did Harry even possess this ability to 'sense' horcruxes to begin with? In that case, why didn't he realize that the diary in 'Chamber of Secrets' is a horcrux, and Slytherin's locket and Nagini in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' are also horcruxes? In such as a situation, the trio would've been totally spared the trouble of wandering around like nomads (searching for the remaining horcruxes) like they did in Part 1.

Anyways that is just a small complaint, overall this is a movie that is worth seeing it in theater. It's a great conclusion to this popular series.",1

Then in 2001, Harry Potter hit the big screen and became one of cinema's most potent franchises then onward. Seven films later comes 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 2' and makes itself out to be the finest conclusion to a film series since Lord of the Rings, Return of the Jedi, and Toy Story 3.

This movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN movie. However we must recognize that the special visual effects are unbeatable, thrilling and of excellent quality. The story is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be properly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes.

It will probably address a young adult/teenage audience, but that is the greatness of it, it grows up with the audience, with the actors, with the characters.

After that, so many flawless movie scenes (when astounding plot-twisting truths are revealed, when Harry and Dumbledore are in Limbo, when Neville gives his speech and kills the snake, when Harry finally kills Voldemort, when they're at King's Cross Station in the epilogue to wrap it all up perfectly with even the little detail of the chocolate frog as a call back to the first movie), just brilliant stuff!

Specifically, Voldemort is a flat villain. After so long, viewers never learned his motivations. Meanwhile, Harry is similarly generic. There isn't much complexity inside his ""chosen one"" trope. Conversely, Snape's compelling reveal gives him and Dumbledore depth (with performances to match). Yet, while that counters the script's shortcomings, it doesn't erase them.",1

163,1.0,"This stuff is retarded. There is virtually no plot. Half the film is filler and the other half is meaningless action. Moreover, the film demands that the audience knows the name of every single protagonist (of which there seems to be an endless supply) and remember everything they have done and said in the previous films. Basically, unless you are a hard core fan who has watched all the films several times and read the books, you will be confused time and again. This film is not shy about introducing a new character every five minutes. Do we need this many characters to tell a story about a magical kid with glasses? The characters are so numerable that virtually every British actor has been given a role. I thought by the end that they might run out of people to cast.",0

165,10.0,"As i already said in my summary, the movie was pretty good, and i also think that there were some elements which may have surprised some of the viewers, but i'll talk about that later. I think i have only one bad point for this movie, but i'm not sure if it was the movie or the cinema... I watched the movie in ""3D"", but the only things that were 3d were the ads BEFORE the movie, and some very short scenes in the movie. I didn't like that at all. To be quite frankly, though i secretly hoped that Harry would survive, i was quite expecting him to die. I don't know, but they said that some ""amazing deaths"" would appear, but i didn't find it amazing that Freddie(i think), Snape, Bellatrix, or Voldemort all died. However, Part1 made you expect that Severus was the bad one, but as i understood he was the good one. I think that the directors were a bit too cruel when they told harry that Dumbledore was a bit of a bad guy. There also are a couple of thing which i really liked about this movie: 1. I think that the graphics were amazing, respect for those who did the image editing. 2. Another interesting part is that in my opinion the producers made up the question whether or not James Potter is Harrys father, because at some point there are mentioned some similarities between Snape and Harry. 3. I was also expecting that if Harry would Survive, he would become the next Headmaster of Hogwarts, but instead he seems o haven a pretty normal Muggle life(come on?!). In my opinion, the most funny part of the entire movie is at the end, where Harry with Ginny and Ron with Hermione bring their children to Hogwarts. The funny thing is that Harry's Son is Called Albus Severus Potter, which in my opinion is interesting, because if it were after the name, he would be the greatest magicians of all time.",1

Although this review is suppose to be about Deathly Hallows part 2 there is just something that was said in the documentary that is actually about something in the film. There were a discussion with David Yates about the finale confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. David said that he chose to have that scene outside in the courtyard and not in the Great Hall as in the books. So, as the Potter fans already know there were no dialog in that scene, where as in the books Harry told Voldemort about the destroying of the horcruxes an also the Deathly Hallows. And that he, Harry, was now the wand's master, and that he is going to put the wand back in Dumbledore's grave, Which, although it is not written in the book, one can assume that he did. In contras with the book scene there is no such dialog in the movie so the secret and history of the elder wand remains a mystery and Harry's decision to break the wand in two and throw ii in the lake is actually more sensible. Because if no one knows about the wand history and power then there will be no temptation (just watch Ron's reaction and then you know why Harry did it) to own it and the deathly hallows will remain just a children's fairy tale.",1
171,9.0,"A wonderful movie and when Snape is dying I got choked up even more so when Harry finally sees who Snape really is and why he acted the way he did towards Harry. A lot of fighting that is brutal and graphic and also very sad when you see who dies. There is a scene of the death eater who is a werewolf gnawing at Luna Lovegoods dead corpse which gave me chills until Harry blasts him out the window which I applauded. Also the duels between Mcgonagall and Snape and Molly Weasley and Bellatrix that are scene stealer's. I loved how Mrs Weasley went ballistic on Bellatrix after she nearly kills Ginny. And tough old broad Maggie Smith shows you why you shouldn't mess with McGonagall - now whether or not Snape had no attention of fighting back, she really lays into him with some serious curses regardless. I wish though that they could have had a better ending , I blame that on Rowling who simply ended it without any wrap-up to the surviving characters -even though I didn't read any of the books i had to see how she ended it compared to the movies ending and its the same so i couldn't blame it all on the people who adapted the book to a movie although from what I've heard from the people who were devoted Potter fans who read the books that a lot of stuff was either cut out or redone differently and really ticked off a lot of the more devoted fans of the books. I can sympathize with that as I thought Lord of The Rings overblown inclusion of Arwen when she was barley mentioned in the books to be more so for the hormone ravaged young boys to gawk at than any real importance .And while the epilogue ending written by Rowling is meant to be heartfelt and sentimental , it was not really fitting in my opinion .skipping ahead 19 years for some reason ,why 19 who knows but it felt forced,with little dialog and no real chemistry between the characters,the makeup effects to make them look older were rather poor and that is why i give this movie a 9 and not a 10.",1
172,6.0,"First of all, it is indeed David Yates' 'Best'. BUT his best is average in comparison to other directors' great works. It is one of those cases where someone's best is just not good enough. The movie's opening scene was good (For a second, I was like 'Can this be? Can this be the one from David Yates'?'). Well, what did I know? There were undoubtedly some moments. There was humor in some occasions. Examples: A) The thing which qualified this movie as the best amongst yates works ( which is only the 4 HP movies :P) is the way he showed the prince's tale chapter. A lot of the credits has to be given to Alan Rickman. I have only seen him showing that much emotion in 'Rasputin'. But Yates also deserves some credits because he got the great out of his actor and portrayed it well. B) Then the moment when Mcgonagall (Maggie Smith) draws herself between harry and snape and start duelling. C) The moment when snape said 'You have got your mother eyes'.

The main focus or my rage is to be focused on the 30 sec light show between Harry and Voldemort. Harry destroys all the Whorecruxes and finally faces off against the ultimate evil but now that his little trinkets are broken he's actually a pretty weak wizard. In fact Harry kills him in 2 seconds and he just melts away. We've been waiting for this battle for 11 years and all that happens is Harry's beam is stronger.

The final chapters of the book where 100 times better than the final parts of the film. When harry looks through Snape's memories it is way to brief, in the book a lot of emotion was shown as Snape saw the downfall to the relationship to himself and Harry potters mother. The battle between harry and Voldemort was truly disappointing as the director changed the engagement into battle between the two (and other main factors that I will not spoil for people reading this review).

Emma, Rupert and Daniel were once again great, and then yet again nothing special. It were the others that made it. Ralph Fiennes was the star, while he put down Lord Voldemort in a magnificent way. And frankly, it wasn't just him that set the tone, Alan Rickman was great (and interesting to see how Snape too has emotions), Maggie Smith was wonderful and didn't we all just love Matthew Lewis as Neville? Rarely have I seen a movie which was thrilling and seated me on the edge of my very uncomfortable cinema seat, from the very beginning. I must say I think it can be quite hard to act when 'under influence of' the Polyjuice potion, but I reckon that Helena Bonham Carter did a great job as pretending to be Hermione pretending to be Bellatrix.

186,9.0,"I was greatly looking forward to this movie.<br /><br />The plot was inventive and unpredictable , the actors' performances were amazing, the visual effects were even better than the previous movies .<br /><br />Better than I could ever imagine, the ending to the franshise can be called Perfect",0
187,,"The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).",1

189,3.0,"It's been 3 years now since I first saw this, but after the very strong ""Deathly Hallows Pt. One,"" this movie came off as a rushed and incompetently written and directed mess (ironic considering they directed part one). I'm shocked J.K. Rowling put the stamp of approval on this heap.",0
190,8.0,"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!",1
191,4.0,"The movie only passingly reflected the second half of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

194,10.0,"OHMYGOD. As a fan who has stuck with them from the first book. I loved it. I found it rather disappointing the way that Voldermorts died. I would have preferred to see that played out as it was in the books. However. That is the only thing i disliked. No film has captivated audiences so much for so long. Alan Rickmans acting was amazing. This movie was amazing no film has had me crying tears of sadness, tears of joy and tears of farewell all in the space of a few hours. I loved it. 13 years i waited to see Ron and Hermione kiss. 13 years well spent in my opinion. Short and sweet review as i was at a midnight showing it's 4am and i'm about to pass out.",1
195,9.0,"One of the (few) benefits of lockdown is to be able to revisit some classics on the big screen again, and that's what I did today for this last flick in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Whereas Deathly Hallows Part 1 (aka ""3 go mad camping"") was low-key, this one hits pretty much all the right notes. It's dark, shocking at times (the dead girl after Greyback's had lunch!) and adds the right amounts of closure and mystery to the saga. There is also some nice humour, especially in the first half of the film.... Helena Bonham Carter playing Hermione playing Lestrange shows just what a fine actress she is.<br /><br />My only gripe... after being the villainess of the piece for so many years, Bellatrix Lestrange gets dispatched a little too easily and quickly for my liking. But a worthy finale, and the ""final"" scene of the three stars on the bridge is genuinely moving (and should have been the end of the film in my book).",1
196,10.0,"This movie was amazing, the experience was quite indescribable. Seeing the last two hours of the biggest part of my childhood was painful but the quality of the movie helped ease the pain. It was remarkably well done David Yates was certainly a great pick for this movie and he was light years ahead of Cuaron and Columbus. Although the movie changed some of the original parts, such as the Grey Lady knowing the location of the Diadem instead of Harry figuring it out or the fact that Percy didn't make his grand apology and that they didn't show Fred's death (there are a few more but I don't want to bore you). But I let all these things slide because in the grand picture everything came together seamlessly. The acting was much better, all of the actors matured and had greatly improved (Daniel Radcliffe especially, he's come a long way from the crying scene at the end of the fourth movie.) Best of all they did the book justice and did the scenes just as I had hoped, I thought the scene of Snape's memories was fantastic. All in all this movie was a spectacular end to a spectacular series and a great send off for the Harry Potter franchise.",1
197,9.0,"Cathartic on many levels, this is an extremely satisfying conclusion to a beloved film series. On a production level the direction, cinematography, score and visual effects are sublime, but the most impressive aspect is an emotional narrative that ties up many loose ends while providing amazing moments for many characters.",1
198,10.0,"When the first episode of this serie reached the big screen, I was 20 and couldn't care less. I was wondering the reason why so many people went literally crazy about Harry Potter in all those years. It took me about 20 years to find out the reason why. Now, I feel kinda ashamed about any prejudice that I brought.<br /><br />I thought they were childish, they had nothing to teach, they were just movies made to fill in the cinemas without a real good content. I was wrong.<br /><br />I watched all Harry Potter's movies during the last week. I'm 40 now but while watching those movies, I got captured by their atmosphere, sympathinzing with their characters, breathing the same air, dreaming of being there lending an hand... My mind went back in time when I was child and shared the same problem with some of characters. Those movies can teach a lot of things, important things: the value of the friendship, love, sacrifice, compassion... They are something I would make my sons watch.<br /><br />The last episode leaves the audience with a sense of fulfillment, yet a sense of void. It's end. Period.<br /><br />David Yates made an extraordinary job as director: the movie slows down when it has to but the action is very fast paced. Acting is impressive, as well. You can tell, movie after movie, how much mature the youngest ones became. The use of CGI is well balanced as it doesn't ruin the movie by being too much invasive. Soundtrack and photograph are simply perfect... The choice of filming is such beatyful places in Great Britain, once again, helps the sense of wonder.<br /><br />I gave this movie and the whole serie 10 stars. I suggest you to watch it at least once in a lifetime because you might learn or find out something hidden within you. Believe a 40 years old child :)",1
199,10.0,"Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry",1
200,8.0,"I saw this on the 2nd july at a preview and was really really impressed. my favourites of the series up till now have been the third one directed by Alfonso Cuaron, and the half blood prince (6th one). I was tentative about the 3d but actually it worked brilliantly and made the pictures even crisper. This film is a great achievement, sometimes i have considered these films as sell- outs, only looking for doing well at the box office, but they have never failed to entertain and this one makes the characters and their motives much more interesting and deeper. ",1
201,5.0,I really trust IMDb for movie rating but for this one... no! thats just impossible too much fanboy! Have you just read the book? Everything is different from the book it's a terrible movie and it'S definitely not worth the 8/10 that people give. The first 7 movies were really decent like 7/10 not perfect but still really enjoyable but this one is just bad. It feel rushed and the ending is terrible because they changed everything. I don't get why people love this one so much its just not good at all. There so so much better movie that came out in 2011 and they don't have as much place as this one. I'm disappointed and I hope that eventually the rating will be corrected. I think this movie is worth a 5/10.,0
202,8.0,"Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying -- and suitably magical -- conclusion",1
203,3.0,"David Yates is one of those directors you either hate or love. If you have never read the book, there is a chance you might like/love his work. If you have read the book, there is a very high chance you want to grab hold of him and stuff the vomit-est vomit flavored Bertie Bott's beans in large amount of quantities in a particular orifice that ...well I leave it to your imagination. I have read the book and I hate his work, his sloppy story lines, his directing of the actors/actresses are hideously horrendous. If ever you want to make a comparison, watch Goblet of Fire and there is a distinct difference in the way the acting is done. This review is about HP7B- HP7B is better than the order of phoenix and very much better than the HBP. I like how he sped the entire 1st part up and yet made the storyline rather polished...then it slowed to crap. Like the HBP, if you have read the book & might have imagined Dumbledore's death much better than what Mr Yates had put out on screen; you know he clearly lacks imagination in delivering real emotion to cinema-goers. Such is the case when Harry finds out he is porky pig walking to a large oven filled with green green light that will bake him to crisp. I was surprised Daniel Radcliff acted pretty well at the end, the mud streaked face and perpetual soot covered all over look made him look very much like a potential murder victim. I also liked certain parts I thought clever like the shield around Hogwarts, very Final Fantasy like; oh an the elaboration of Ron n Hermione destroying the cup- thank you very much, I always thought JK rushed through that part rather carelessly. But again, the snog-ging o the snogging, must it be so well...necessary and fake. Then there was the ending, my point about Mr Yate's lack of ability to deliver proper emotion to ticket holders exact. Zap zap and zap zap and then Volde dies, then oh lets just waltz back to school. No yelling whooping cheering elation screams of joy clap hands stadiums filled with ecstasy. Just ... Nothing, the sickest baddest mother of naughty wizards without noses has finally been killed! zip nothing. It seemed like Mr. Yates ran out of budget, time, creativity towards the end and quickly sped through the script for the sake of making tons of muggle gold. Then the worst thing happened- the wand of destiny, the death-stick, the branch of doom, the amazingness fantastic-est bes-test most sought after stick of power! The ONE STICK TO RULE THEM ALL!! The one link to the DEATHLY HALLOWS was snapped like a brittle piece of instant noodle by a teenage boy. He wrangled that thing like an irritating wet fibrous piece of wood and tossed it away. All for the sake of not having to explain too much. Yes! Mr Yates, the reason readers really hate you is, you take short cuts just because of your inept ability to tell good stories in film- you did not want to explain too much how Harry could survive Voldy's zap, you were just too lazy to elaborate on the Deathly Hallows and did not trust us to understand wand lore. The result is, HP7B is very much a confusing movie for muggle readers and to those who have been magically blessed to read the book, it lacks imagination. 8.4 on IMDb! Pffttttt what a load of crock.",1

213,6.0,"When I watched all Harry Potter films for the first time earlier this year within a short period of time, I really loved the very last entry to the series. Most recently, I rewatched just the last film and the experience was not as great, but still made an entertaining two hours. So let me recommend you to always watch at least ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" before going for the final installment. But whatever you do, you're still in for an exciting conclusion to the biggest film franchise of the 2000s and that comes from somebody who isn't even that big of a Potter fan. While the three young actors are okay as always, although I still struggle to see Radcliffe's Potter as the force he is supposed to be and Watson had more material and a better performance in previous work, it's nice to see some of the supporting players have great spectacular scenes as well before it all closes: Julie Walters on Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith on Alan Rickman and Rickman himself in his final scene, who was probably my favorite performance here and I really loved how it all unfolded for Severus. The way we find out more about his background was done impressively, especially the flashbacks to his childhood and they really hit me on an emotional level. That certainly made up for the first half hour, where the film admittedly needs a while to really get going. The final scene 19 years later was really beautiful too, particularly the name reference (which made me ignore the fact that the trio doesn't really look 20 years older), and even if it probably guarantees there will be no more Potter films in the future, it was such a nice inclusion and there was something beautifully final about it.",1

215,10.0,"I am a huge Harry Potter book fan, and have always been a bit disappointed with each film. There has always been key aspects left out, bits that weren't put together as well as the novels, etc. But coming into this film I was hoping to not leave the theatre thinking, I wish they had done this or that, and after waiting in line for 7 hours, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes and a feeling of utter content. Through out the movie each piece that has hung in the air through out all 8 movies, was finally tied together, finally you were able to understand what everything was for and why it happened that way.

216,,"This is one of those films that is simply to hard to critique due to the millions of fans going into the film with unconditional love. I however did not have that problem despite greatly enjoying the books. This film suffers from a certain shallowness that plagues the whole movie. The themes which come into fruition are poorly developed and appeal to our tendency towards intellectual simplicity. Everything in the film is black and white. There are no middle grounds. Your either with Harry, or against him. This presents a template which just seems artificial and lacking depth.",0

This is perhaps the only movie that tells the story with all the detail and beauty that it should be told. You're in for a thrilling end to an amazing series. The acting was fantastic, the special-effects wonderful and the lines and sound was captivating. I am a dedicated Harry Potter fan and have been for 11 years, and when the Credits rolled, I cried.

It made a good finale by making it epic and larger. It's far better than part 1 and the action sequences are praisingly exciting.'Avengers Assemble' didn't need to beat it as the box office record that was the 3rd highest grossing film of all time but took this down a level lower because it shouldn't ridiculously be as successful as this. Although the 3D was an unpleasant experience David Yates(director) has the soul of an epic conclusion. An aspect of characters and relationships that return for the last time. Full of untold flashbacks and spellbinding visual effects, this film has to end with a big bang, laughter, excitement and sadness. Goodbye Harry Potter. You've changed cinema and enchanted the world for the last 10 years. We'll always remember from the beginning of his childhood to the death of evil he banquised.",1

The movie seemed to be in a rush to conclude the series and provided little in the background stories required to make it unforgettable. For moviegoers that did not know the story, I would expect some confusion. For those of us that read the book, I would expect plain disappointment. Unlike the conclusion to Lord of the Rings, this will not be an Oscar contender. I'm surprised that the stories author hasn't complained; my God they had two movie to do the ending properly and they missed entirely. As I read my review, I'm reconsidering the 8.

Everything is going on pretty fast from that spot! I usually don't like violence and gore, but there is some... Voldemort appears to be walking with feet covered in blood in Malfoy Manor. There are some really light and joyful moments in Hogwarts... Until Voldemort comes by. There are some epic scene including McGonagall looking really sad and cheerful at the same time.

250,6.0,"I don't even think its close to how poorly this ended off the series especially in its false interpretation of the book's sequences. I truly did enjoy the film for the first half till about three quarters in. In the theater you are of course excited, its part 2, its the end of it all and the film starts and progressively keeps its frightened but epic tone that it needs to build it into the battle that is inevitably coming. Acting is good and all, good cinematography as usual with interesting cameras and the great makeup as usual. But that part of the film is NOT what ended the final chapter of the era that is Harry Potter. The fact there is no dialogue nor anyone watching during the final battle between the 2 of them (not to mention, no ""expelliarmus"" to finish Him off) is just not right at all. There is no dramatic ending or any kind of serious film making being done in the final 2- 4 scenes. Its just quick shots of the three/Neville fighting off Nagini and Voldemort for a minute and then its just harry and him in a quick draw with no talking between them despite that being probably the most exciting time in the books history!!!! This is just unbelievably frustrating and disappointing to me as I watch DH2 for the 2nd and 3rd times. After watching and during watching this film I don't feel as a viewer at all that Harry is finally about to end it, finally going to literally save the world from the worst person to ever supposedly live. No drama built up, NO ANYTHING. All we get is harry, ron, and hermoine standing next to each other as if it was any old adventure they've been on, after a simple 5 second battle between harry and a mortal version of Voldemort. In my opinion as a Harry fan, JUST AWFUL:",0

Actually the movie is only 2 hours, still got some free time to extend, maybe 10 more minutes in the scene when Harry Potter died, more time to explain about Master of Death & Deathly Hallows. It's so shameful, the essence & main story of the last series, like in the title ""Deathly Hallows"" has no portion in this movie. That's the climax part that should be has some heroic feeling, ""wow"" feeling and eager but it's just flat in this movie!",0
254,6.0,"Perhaps more than any other of the series, this movie has no standing on it's own. While better viewed in order, any of the first six could be viewed and enjoyed on their own with someone unfamiliar with the books or previous movies.

Even though I was a fan of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and I never was actually into ""Harry Potter"", I believed in the power of this author and this masterpiece; after reading the book. Extra-ordinary work of character development, relations and creativity. Extra-ordinary work of humour , fantasy and imagination. The power of mankind in terms of how different could it be from other creatures in expansion of such beautiful art-works was observable within this book. Oh, Should I write about the Movie here?

258,,"This was perhaps the best of all the Harry Potter Movies. Although I think they rushed through the Gringgots story line and the main battle with Voldermort should have followed the book closer, there were many scenes not in the book which I felt made up for this. For example Longbottom and Finigan blowing up the bridge, or the simple five words added to Snapes death, ""You have your mothers eyes."" ",1
259,5.0,"I thought for the final film it was a huge let down. ( i haven't read the books so I'm just seeing it from film perspective) certain scenes that you would expect to see in the film weren't like deaths or certain main characters (Ron's brother) and the length of those scenes we did see were really short so had no emotion (e.g the death of snape, bellatrix)....the fight and the death of voldemort should have been much longer considering we have been waiting more than 8 years to see that happen. the battle scenes were short too and it jumped from calm to fighting really quickly...there was hardly any build up. And when harry goes to heaven or what ever that was...was just plain silly. The worst of all...Daniel Radcliffe was so wooden and boring to watch! I did like the bit where we saw Snapes memories that was well done. Think the film was more of a money maker than a film to signify the end of an era.",0

He doesn't hide under the invisibility cloak and reappear later. 2. They drag out the snake killing, but thankfully Neville still kills it in the end. 3. Voldemort and Harry do not get the epic showdown in the Great Hall. Instead they fight everywhere and the Elder Wand explanation is dragged out. All in all the movie was very disappointing because of how much of the end they replaced. It's like they took the major plot points and threw the book out the window.",0

The movie begins with the last final minutes of Part I where Voldemort open's Dumbledore's grave to steal his wand which I think was a good opening. The story goes very fast from there on as there's much to be told and rhythm keeps the audience on their toes, it's a roller coaster.",1
272,1.0,The movie does not cover most of the important plots of other characters. The movie only only tells the story of harry Potter whereas the other character are far more interesting but the movie leaves their story out completely.It is not just this movie but the whole series was not made well. They have spent too much time trying to show harry's emotions instead of showing more about the magical world. Primarily the movie is shot for kids and not for mature adults unlike the books. The special effects are good but was highly disappointed by the story. The movie might be worth watching for the people who haven't read the book but i would recommend everyone to read the books instead of seeing this movie.,0

276,,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 as far as special effects and 3d were concerned were quite spectacular. The story and the acting were also very much head and shoulders above that of when the young actors started the franchise. I have to say I really enjoyed this film but that's only because I had a Harry Potter translator to get my through it. I have never read the books so my only look into the life of Harry Potter is through the films and as they are films they can only ever be adaptations from a much larger story that wouldn't be feasible in film to try and recreate. However with the story stretching over eight films now you would think there would have been a little bit more explanation as to why everything was happening. I got a general outline of why but no depth into what I have been told is a very well thought out and deep set of books. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the film I am just saying it could of been closer to a great film if there had been just a little bit more time filling in the cracks in the Plot. I'll finish with this Harry potter book fans will love this Harry Potter film fans get the book fans to explain why things are happening and sit back and enjoy its wizarding goodness.,1
277,6.0,"Well I was very excited for the last movie , because i really liked the first part ..... but something happened when I watched the second movie ... I felt very disappointed .

279,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best movie in the Harry Potter series. More than anything, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 packs an intense emotional punch. The scenes involving Snape's memories, Harry's experience with the Resserctuction Stone in the forest, and Harry ultimately going to face his ""death"" are all very poignant and moving. Deathly Hallows part 2 is mostly faithful to the book with one major exception and it's a good exception. The biggest difference is that in the book Harry returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. In the movie Harry's snaps the Elder Wand in half and throws the pieces into the lake. I like the movie's way of handling the Elder Wand's fate much better than the book's because it makes it absolute 100% sure it really is the end of the line. Not much to talk about casting wise as we've seen them all before expect the children of the epilogue. Daniel and Emma remain fantastic in the lead roles as do Allan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes in key roles of Voldemort and Snape. And of course both the character of Luna Lovegood and her actress Evanna Lynch remain huge personal favorites of mine. The pacing is excellent. It's about a 2 hour movie and never has a slow moment. The music is different to match the emotional nature of the story and it fits well. And definitely loved hearing Leaving Hogwarts return at the end of the epilogue. That was awesome. The story is well presented. Great emotional finale. Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 10 out of 10. Casting/acting: 10 out of 10.

However, I have to admit that the last 10 years have been phenomenal for Rowling in not just establishing a fan base, or a cult following, or even a massive bank account, but in creating a whole new world; The world of Harry Potter and his adventures. What started as a lighthearted venture into the world of myth and magic ten years ago, culminates into a dark and powerful showdown between the forces of good and evil. Both parts are well interlinked, but the plot seems stretched at times. This is obviously due to the cinematic rendition of Rowling's books. The highlights are easily notable from both parts:",1

283,,"So, the series comes to an end, with Harry and his friends in the big showdown with Voldemort. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" continues the style that the series began to adopt in part 5, as a look at resistance to totalitarianism: you may recall that the Death Eaters aim to ""purify"" the wizarding world by eliminating anyone whom they don't consider a ""real"" wizard.",1
284,3.0,"Story: Now this is where the film falls short the most, paramount importance is given to scenes where cheap romance occurs (retrieval of the basilisk teeth), which does nothing to enrich the plot, because it has no effect on the overall story, but the filmmaker does not seem o think it is important to explain Harry's ""loljks, I wasn't dead"", probably assuming that most people have read the book and the others will just say ""It was probably magic"", but this cannot be too much of a criticism because many of these weak storytelling mechanisms are taken directly from the books. As for the epilogue it seems cheap, gratuitous and completely out of tone with the rest of the film. It feels like it was left there to get a few cheap laughs and to leave the viewer with no uncertainty that Harry does live happily ever after. But most of these criticisms should probably go into a book review, because the source material is as weak as the film itself.",0

290,5.0,Alan Rickman did an awesome job with his portion of the story - his character was never separate from the book character. But the story was so rewritten as to miss many points that were important to the story. I understand how writers want to make the story their own from the original book writer but the value in the story comes from characters. Harry Potter was an introvert played by an extrovert actor. There were bits of the story from the book such as the final between Voldemort and Harry that went so much deeper to me in the book. Some of that value was lost in how the film portrayed the scene.,0
291,2.0,I am a large fan of the harry potter books and have enjoyed watching at least the early Harry Potter movies. I must say however this is a horribly disappointing movie seemingly made by a production team who have no intuition at all.,0
292,6.0,"To be fair, it wasn't the worst HP film; that was Order of the Phoenix which was totally butchered. Most of this one was OK. All the changes in the movie from the book, up until Harry's final battle with Voldemort, were true to the spirit, plot and theme of the book. But Harry's final battle, and the fact that Hogwart's was destroyed (which did not happen in the book) were totally wrong, and there was no point to it. In the book, Voldermort and Harry face in one short battle, inside the front hall of Hogwarts, with all the combatants around them, watching. Neville has already killed the snake outside, and rallied the ""good guys"" by crying ""Dumbledore's Army"" and standing up to Voldemort. There was NO point to changing that, so of course they did. The duel between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix was way too short and without enough drama to make you care. I had expected the audience-- and myself-- to cheer at the end of that duel; no one did. The book's final battle between Harry and Voldermort was meant to be simple, one-on-one, in the place they both loved; it was meant to show that love was the strongest weapon, and that Voldemort was no more than Tom-Riddle-gone-bad. On dying he collapsed dead before them all, vanquished. It will never make sense to me why they changed such a basic part of the whole plot. The best I can say for this one is that it could have been much worse. My advice to anyone is to read these books before you see the movies, so you understand what you're missing.",0

I was blown away by the effect and of course the atmosphere of the movie. Part 1 had me feeling like it was building a momentum for a great ending, however i still had the feeling while watching part 2. It was as if something great was yet to come, but sadly it didn't really come. Example: There weren't any great big fights (like the showdown between Voldemort and Dumbledore in Order Of The Phoenix) and the usage of spells was pretty much the same as in all the hp movies (with some exceptions). But the thing that bothers me the most was the ending, it felt as if the last couple of minutes were just something that had to be done, after the moment we all have bee waiting for(between Harry and Voldemort)it felt as if the rest was just a necessity of a couple of minutes. for example: there wasn't much talking between the characters/ no praising harry or anything. and there was hardly any respect for the fallen ""soldiers"". Generally speaking this doesn't mean that it lets u down, however one can not help but feel a little bit of disappointment after reading the book.

The guy is Just a Technician, NOT a Storyteller!!!!! Yates assumed that everyone in the theatre read the book before they entered, which must be 80% true, but in adaptations from books to movies the movies must stand by themselves, and not to require to consult the book to understand what the ""bloody hell"" happened out of camera, forgetting the unexplained ""holes"", the movie, his movies from the 5th to this last one"" become so mechanical in the way the story were told, and seemed so rushed"", Yates forgot to bring up the emotions and feelings in the characters, I wanted to be emotionally touched by Dumbledore's death in the 6th but he died like a dog and i didn't see a bloody tear in any of the characters ""no funeral for the headmaster?"" even when we had a funeral for some x dude called Cedric in the 4th?'I was expecting George's death to be a big EMOTIONAL event in the movie, I am not bloody sure if he was George at all because they didn't mentioned his name. Yates focus importance in events, in taking the story from one point to the next, forgetting the emotional psychology that should be in the characters. Many are saying that the books are too big to be totally faithfully adapted to the big screen, BULLSHIT, Lord Of The Rings was bigger and it delivered! why, they had a director that knows how to tell the stories from a more human and intelligent point of view. others said that we expected too much from the movie, Come on, Its ""HARRRY POTTER"" it HAD to be BIG! not just in scale of ""events"".

321,2.0,"Seriously guys. Many of you probably won't agree with me, but good movies are made of innovations. When something completely different from your expectations happens, you get surprised (obviously) and then amused, because it's completely different. This key factor makes a movie IMPREVISIBLE, and that, my friend, did not happen at Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.",1
322,8.0,"I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride starting off slow, until you reach the first action sequence, then rushes headstrong into another series of scenes, focusing mostly on Harry and his charge of destroying the horcruxes. This is Harry's story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. Along the way, several characters stand out. Neville Longbottom makes a stand and Professor McGonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie. I must mention the genius of Alan Rickman as Snape here, he was a defining point in this film and one of the reasons it was so special. Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialogue didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me. The whole movie looked amazing. The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy. This film was great, and the best finale a fan could have asked for. It's an incredibly memorable movie and one that i will never fail to enjoy.",1

325,8.0,I absolutely love the Harry Potter books. I think Deathly Hallows part 1 was best in a sense that it stayed true to the book. Part 2 takes from where we left off.,1
326,3.0,This movie was a big disappointment.Im going to make this short and sweet.The movie sucked.The only reason I gave it 6 stars is because of the battles.Without the intense scenes this movie deserves 4 stars.Lets start in the beginning.Its starts right off where the last movie left off.Not good at all.Even if you saw the movie a couple months ago you will not remember all of the last film.So the film producers were kind of stupid of not taking 5 minutes of the film and tell us what happen before.Like when they run on TV a two episode with the same plot and on the second episode in the beginning they say previously.Thats what they should of done.So I what I would do is see part 1 again.Then go see this film.What really kills me is that this movie is on the top 250 list.This movie is a disgrace to all movies.The only reason this movie got on the list so far is because everybody who has voted for it is a harry potter fan.So when you see on the list don't let it fool you.The only thing that is worth seeing in this movie is the attack on hogwarts castle.But remember Im not a hairy potter fan.I reviewing this movie as a critic.I don't care if its harry potter or not this movie was a disappointment to me but maybe not to harry potter fans.One other thing i feel sorry for the people who camped out 4 night just to see the midnight showing of this movie.,0
327,6.0,"This is an overall rating based on binge watching the six during lockdown, admittedly when it came out first I fell asleep in the cinema to the philosophers stone but my tastes changed so thought I'd try again, thoroughly enjoyed one and two and three was my favourite, 4,7 I thought were really average with 5 6 and 8 being a mixed bag in between, but overall I feel it's a good series but massively overrated film and culture wise.",1
328,5.0,"The general idea is that you don't fix what ain't broken. Unfortunately that's what they seem to be trying here anyway. I was happy that the finale was split into two, seeing as 'Half Blood Prince' was such a disaster. But they did it unevenly and the bulk went into part one. So this part felt rather sparse and lackluster story wise. Still, what actually disappointed me was how they skipped and shuffled bits around trying to make it more impressive and in the process butchered everything I loved about 'Deathly Hallows'. The final battle for example. There were things I was really looking forward to watching on screen - small but significant scenes, characters rising up to the occasion, explanations, finally. Maybe because it's the finale, expectations are obviously sky high and on top of that I've always loved the books very much. But I get the feeling the people who made this movie don't really have much love for this universe. The acting is average, special effects alright, but nothing is impressive. It's not bad, but not very good either. At least not the end I was hoping for.",0
329,6.0,"Up until this point the Harry Potter franchise has been a series of mediocre film after mediocre film, with a vast majority of them being just plain awful. Part I was one of the worst films I ever saw in my life, it was dull, long, and incredibly stupid. I could not have been less excited about this film even if it had been hailed as the best movie of all time. Yet, nevertheless, I dished out the $18.50 for Imax and 3D to see this film with some friends. Does this film transcend the c*** of the other films? Or does this final installment sink lower than Part I did? ",0
330,9.0,"The one that ends it all, after 8 films (7 books) in the wizarding world, Harry finally has a showdown with He Who Has No Nose, and it's rather confusing, but also satisfying, and other than Harry and Valdemort, the other characters who get to shine are Mrs. Weasley, who gets fed up and dispatches Bellatrix, Neville Longbottom, who singlehandedly stands up against Valdemort despite everyone laughing at him, and it is he who offs Valdemort's snake, the last vestige of his soul, allowing Harry to finish him of - and Neville also gets the girl (Luna Lovegood, a cute couple), and finally there's Severus Snape, who turns out not to be a villain after all, but endured a lot as he infiltrated Valdemort's ranks in a plan that eventually proved fatal, and all because he loved Harry's mother from afar. In the end, Harry looks upon Snape as one the bravest, noblest men he's ever known, or ever will know. So yeah, a very entertaining conclusion.",1
331,7.0,"Aaaaaaaaahh redemption. Much improved over part 1. The acting and dialogue were still a bit stiff and my comments previously on how magical combat it handled still stands but there is much more going on this time. The battle of Hogwarts was surprisingly rather well handled. Despite my issues with the combat, there were some little bits of creativity like a quick time freeze and large fiery beasts. Although basic, the terracotta army was pretty cool to see also. Many character deaths made the stakes and consequences feel more real adding some emotional depth that wasn't there for me in part 1 (other than Dobby). The action was much more competently filmed but there were quite a few moments where it felt like the extras were running or standing around not doing anything. More of a nitpick though. ",1
332,7.0,"This will maybe be a positive for many people but for my taste there was far too much of the never ending action scenes in this movie that otherwise had a great storyline they could have been better developing and focusing on. The action scenes were almost bad enough for ne to go down to 6 stars. If you've ever gotten a headache from visual stimuli, beware of this chaos.",0
333,6.0,"I've been a fan of the Harry Potter series from the start. Not a huge fan, but I've watched them all and I've enjoyed most of them.",1
334,,"For ten years I have been waiting for this and now it's finally here: The epic conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise and it's worth the wait. Why only 7 stars? I felt that the movie had a little too many plot threads to handle in the end. For instance when Harry goes into the hall with all those dead characters we know and might love and you sit there thinking: ""How did that happen?"" and you get no explanation. It was a while since I read the book so I didn't remember that much. It also scratched the surface of Dumbledore's past without really diving into it and if you ask me they shouldn't have included it in the movie at all because it didn't have the running time to flesh it out properly. But the positive point definitely outweighed the negatives. The acting was terrific from all parts. If Daniel Radclife starts acting in roles which do not resemble the Harry Potter character and keeps doing it he surely will be remembered as not only Harry Potter but a good actor. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint supported him perfectly. I also love Alan Rickman in anything he does and this is no exception and Ralph Fieness as Voldemort was a pleasure too. The action was really well done, the effects were splendid and you really gave a damn about what was going on even if you read the book and knew what was goiing to happen. The final confrontation between Voldemort and Harry was actually way better than in the book where I really thought Rowling copped out but this was thrilling! The ending bit was also very touching until the last ten seconds where my theater had technical difficulties and the screen went green. If you like Harry Potter you have to see this movie for obvious reasons and I tell you it's a good time some script problems aside.",1

337,7.0,"Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows part 2, directed by David Yates is a thriller and an adventure film, based on J.K.Rowlings novel. It stars the same actors as all the others: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint; Emma Watson the three wizards on the hunt for the horcruxes which are the magical items that must be searched and destroyed as they are the keys to Voldermorts existence, it is vital to destroy them before the dark lord finds them. The action begins with the fight between good and evil, who will win? This is the last of the eight and is surely the one to sum it up with its gripping action and strong plot which gives you different ideas to how it may end. With different directors each time, this director made an impression which will last, besides first impressions always last. Compared to part 1 of Deathly Hallows which did more talking rather than fighting, but this one is the completely opposite. Harry confronting his enemy and with sacrifices, loyalty and betrayal it all spells out disaster. This is how Rowling puts the pieces together to make the Harry Potter a book for everyone, who knew it, would even get adults crying. Also what I think was great about this film was the clever music, which was very eerie and simple which gave every scene its clutch. We also get to see some of the new enemies such as the dragons, voldermorts gang as well as Snape's motives, who is what good or bad? As the film goes on we get an understanding of why Snape took the actions he did, this is what I like about Rowling how she turned a misunderstood character into a hero. Voldermort is another one which will catch you out as the fact that he is similar to Harry. When Harry is knocked out by Voldermort and meets Dumbledore who explains without Harry's existence there would be no Voldermort due to the fact that harry is the last horcruxe. This was again very clever of Rowling how she explains why harry can sense voldermorts feelings and why he can speak snake language which all begins to make sense. I personally felt that Snapes scene where Harry sees his past was the most emotional and most felt part, as you see a part of Snape which we didn't see before, how he was madly in love with Harry's mother, bullied by Harry's father and what he did to sacrifice his life for Harry. When Harry has to fight Voldermort, the first thing that came to my mind was that Harry might die because you don't know what is going to happen next. The director has been able to build tension throughout the film. He has been able to draw the attention of the audience into the most important scenes throughout the film. Another thing which the director did that court my attention was his creativity with the special effects and what summed it all up was putting it up in 3D which brought the whole thing to life. It made fans of Harry Potter such as I feel surrounded in the magical world of wizardry, which is a great experience to have if you love Harry Potter like I do. What I think may have been a spoiler was the fact that not everything written in the book was mentioned in the film and this is a real shame. Also the fact that everyone else in Gryffindor is allowed to fight except from slithering who were locked in the dungeons and were not allowed to fight and there wasn't enough interaction with the characters as when Fred (cousin to Ron) dies there isn't any sympathy not even from Harry. Other than these negative the rest of the film was great and was rated 8 out of 10 for everything also with 408 critics which gave more ratings, no wonder this was the best film of 2011. But a positive would be that the directors kept the same actors for all 8 films as we have seen them grow from young children into adults. Also the battle at Hogwarts was very heart grabbing as we saw a lot of character's who gave themselves up especially Neville who did all he can do protect harry which I thought was perfected as this was the exact same thing that was written in the book about him. The ending was where we all got the message that this is it, there isn't any more of the Harry Potter adventures when harry and his wife (Ron's sister) and Ron with Herminie sending their children off to Hogwarts, we sense that this is it for Mr Potter. This is a great way to say farewell to the Harry Potter adventures along with this film this one made it worthwhile as it started and ended with action what is more we got a better understanding of Harry Potter and all the characters. If I were to rate this film it would be ten out of ten so if you are thinking of watching it then you should.",1
338,,"SPOILER ALERT!! Ever since the final book was released and I read it beginning to end in one night, I have been imagining how the final scenes would be played out in the movie. The book ending was absolutely perfect!! Unfortunately, it seems I will have to continue to imagine that perfect ending because the movie ending bears little resemblance to the book. The producers and writers mucked up yet another ending.",1
339,,"I'm not a particularly big fan of this franchise if I'm honest, so for me when the final films came out I was more than happy to let the crowds come and go and I'd watch it at my leisure. It's not that I was apathetic but I've never bothered with the books beyond reading a few chapters of one to a child many moons ago and the film series took quite some time to really engage me. It did this as it got darker and, although the last film felt like it was stuck in a holding pattern, I did still enjoy it because it was very dark throughout. With this final film I had hoping that this brooding would continue but, being unfamiliar with the books, unlike many viewers I wasn't sure what was going to happen (despite Simon Mayo and Mark Kermode's consistent best efforts to give me spoilers).",1
340,5.0,"It is better then the other films by a million (not including deathly hallows part 1 which I enjoyed). The basic plot is that Harry,Ron and Hermione have to find the remaining horcruxes, but the final battle is coming near.When Voldemort dies at the end of the film no one cares which is really stupid, considering that Voldemort is the reason that all those people are dead. Also the bond between Harry and Tom Riddle is not explained as well as it is in the book. And the old magic inside Harry given to him by his mother, is not explained well enough for someone who hasn't read the book.Daniel Radcliffe is getting to be a better actor then he was in the dreary fifth movie. This movies biggest problem is that the battle of Hogwarts ",0
341,8.0,"This was the finale in the highly popular film series, based on the equally popular series of books by J.K. Rowling, and when I saw that it was rated the full five out of five stars, and available in 3D, there was no way I would miss it. Basically the story continues from where Part 1 left off, after Dobby the house elf was killed, and Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) found the powerful Elder Wand in the grave of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). Friends Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are still searching for the hidden Horcruxes, the secret to Voldermort's immortality, and with the help of goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis) they break into the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) to find one. After escaping the goblin bank with the help of a white dragon, we see the Dark Lord and the other villains have taken over Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) has become the new headmaster. After meeting Dumbledore's brother Aberforth (Ciarán Hinds) the friends are taken by Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) through a secret passageway to Hogwarts, and they are reunited with old friends in hiding. Snape is informed of Harry's return, but he is confronted, leaving way for Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) to start the revolution with many of the remaining teachers against the dark forces. Harry meanwhile is told by Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to go and see the ghost for Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly Macdonald) to find one of the last Horcruxes, and finds out it is hidden in the Room of Requirement. Ron and Hermoine meanwhile destroy the Horcrux from Lestrange's vault with the fang of the Basilisk skeleton in the Chamber of Secrets, and they also share their first kiss. While the teachers and some students fight against the dark forces, Harry goes to the Room of Requirement and finds the hidden Horcrux, and although confronted and nearly killed by old enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the three friends save his life. After destroying this Horcrux and weakening Voldermort more, Harry looks into the Dark Lord's mind and sees that the final Horcrux is the snake Nagini, and they witness him kill Snape with the Elder Wand. Before dying however Snape gave Harry some tears, and in the Pensieve these are used to look into the past, where he sees Snape was not only in love with his mother Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), but that he was also there on the night when she and James Potter (Adrian Rawlins). But the bigger twist than that is that the reason Voldermort did not kill him on that night was because he is the final Horcrux he unintentionally created, so according to Dumbledore he is destined to die. Harry decides to follow this path by going into the Forbidden Forest and confronting the Dark Lord himself, allowing him to cast the Killing Curse, therefore sending him to a white limbo, where he is given wise words by Dumbledore that Voldermort has in fact killed the dark part within him. After Harry returns to his body we see Voldermort overjoyed that he has ""killed"" him, and asking all to obey him now, however Harry springs to life and runs away, while everyone else fights. While the duelling between the hero and villain goes on, Neville decapitates the snake Nagini with the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, therefore all the Horcruxes are destroyed, leaving Voldermort mortal, and he combusts into ash and is blown away. The final scenes see Harry reject the powers of the Elder Wand despite being the rightful owner, and sixteen years later we see older Ron and Hermoine, and Harry and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) on Platform 9 3/4 saying goodbye to their own children as they head for Hogwarts for their first term. Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Jim Broadbent as Professor Horace Slughorn, Miriam Margolyes as Professor Pomona Sprout, Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Nick Moran as Scabior, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney, Devon Murray as Seamus Finnigan, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Chris Rankin as Percy Weasley, Leslie Phillips as The Sorting Hat and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. It is going to feel odd for a year or two not to expect another Harry Potter film, all the actors are of course fantastic in their roles, many parts of the story, especially the one or two big twists work really well, and the amazing special effects serve the final film fantastically, a highly watchable fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up & Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!",1
342,6.0,"So the effects were spectacular--come on, we've all fantasized about how Hogwarts would be torn apart, haha, and how the stone soldiers will fight giants. But it was really funny in an unintended way. 1. Moldy Voldy seems to be a weak doddering old man, with no menacing air at all. 2. Snape makes me want to fall asleep as he talks to s-l-o-w-l-y. But he looked quite handsome when he's in love with Lily Potter, and as a kid. Hehe once in his lifetime probably. 3. Dumbledore looked evil 4. Harry suddenly became really pro at dueling. 5. Ron is a idiot who just states the really obvious 6. Hermione becomes dumber after just one kiss from Ron. 7. Neville suddenly become a hero that always carry his sword around. 8. Prof McGonagall rocks. The funny parts: When Voldy kill Harry, he purposely drag out the ""AVAHDAR KEDAVRA"" which he thinks sounds epic but which really sounds hilarious. Bad dialogue. Voldy: ""the boy who lived..."" no longer? Harry: ""You-know-who"" sucked? Yeah, he sucked. Funny images including baby Harry with the weird lightning scar. When Voldy laughed and kept on repeating Harry Potter's death. seriously the whole cinema laughed. When the death eaters storm into Hogwarts with Harry and giants roll off the cliff--OMG those dumb giants were farming and then they're too fat and roll off, HAHA. When Neville woke up admist the fighting and he looked dazed, really funny. The giant protective sphere being attacked by ""fireworks""--looked like sperms attacking an egg lol. I guess some people will cry because they're sentimental, but to me and my friends, it is just hilariously funny. I love Harry Potter, but to me this seems more like a TV final episode than a stand alone movie.",0
343,10.0,"It is the most famous screen adaptation in the history of cinema. Even people, who have not ever seen it, know this story about the wizard which came to our world to overcome the evil. There were seven books and eight films, because the last part was shared into two flicks due to new Hollywood standard. If you have not guessed yet, we are talking about the novel by Joan Rowling. The last film about Harry Potter was realized on the 7th of July in 2011. And it was the highest-grossing film of this year and the tenth-highest-grossing film of the all times. <br /><br />What is the secret of success of the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2""? To solve this mystery let's focus on the key factors of a movie success such as: plot and story, their relevance to the audience, star power, director, special effects, budget, release date and critics' reviews. All of these constituents are here. <br /><br />It is obviously that the plot resonates with the dreams and beliefs of target audience. Harry finally met with his enemy and the greatest battle is going to start, but surprisingly Voldemort become stronger than Harry has excepted. What way the inseparable trinity, Harry, Ron and Hermione will found to protect their school and their world? It seems to sound impossible but Harry decides to sacrifice his life to bring the death to Voldemort. The audience froze in anticipation, everyone would like Harry to live. Despite all fans of Harry Potter know the end of the book they are truly worrying during the film. <br /><br />It is going without saying that the most part of actors, who has been shooting for more than ten years at the all previous films, has a large and enthusiastic fan base. Not only main characters which were played by Denial Radcliff, Rupert Green and Emma Watson but actors of supporting roles too, like Allen Rickman or Helena Bonham Carter - of course, they were gained recognition from the audience. <br /><br />A well-known director is one more important factor. David Yates shot three movies about Harry Potter before the last one, but none of these parts has such huge box-office. They all made a great profit over 900 thousand dollars but the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" has raised 1,3 billion dollars. David Yates has brought whole his experience into his last film, he knew how to make the perfect picture.<br /><br />Since the 2000s ""Harry Potter"" has changed significantly. The last part was not a fairy tale like the first part, it was amazing, mysterious and scaring world. And director needed the computer-generated imagery to integrate magic world into a real life and make film more gripping. Needless to say, that the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" was recognized by the Academy Award for the best visual effects and was awarded by BAFTA at this nomination also. Thanks to the soundtracks by gorgeous Alexandre Desplat the film won the Annual Grammy's Award. <br /><br />""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" had a budget of 250 million dollars and was co-financed by Warner Broth. Pictures and Heyday films which were very generous for whole necessary things. <br /><br />Another reason of the film's acceptance is a good labeled from the critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four and said, ""The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.""<br /><br />At last, the release date. It was the middle of the summer, when cinemas became full of Harry Potter's fans. Not all previous parts were turned out in summer, lots of them were screened in autumn or in winter, when many of viewers has not opportunities to visit cinema palaces.<br /><br />To sum it up, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" is an example of a commercially successful movie where various factors come into play to bring millions of viewers and provide the renown from the world cinema to all members of the film's production unit.",1

The movie was extremely well received by the hundreds I watched it with, and received high emotional reactions as well raving conversations. Big fans might want to bring a tissue box or two. This movie starts out right were it left off in part one. It go's right into things, but you aren't at any lose of memory, and if you are the film cleverly reminds you subliminally. There is not a moment that fades interest. in the begging I did find the dialogue a little bland, things were happening fast and were generally had a unattached feeling to the rest of the movie, thus the only reason I give it a nine instead of a ten. Things really get into the beauty of what makes this movie what it is, which is the characters and the story. This movie hits all the emotions with still knowing what it. you could be crying over dead friends or friends brought back, or clapping with the audience while Neville slays Negini, or Mrs.Weasly kills Belatrix, and when there is the spontaneous kiss scene between Ron and Hermoiny, all releasing 7 movies worth of tension. Concerning the fact that they split this into two parts; I think it was a good move. this movie does something its predecessors couldn't do, which is fit in loose ends. back in the third movie some would whine about things that were left out. This second half takes care of all that. i'm guessing the screen writer had a list and would have to make sure everything was included in a flowing way making sure it did not cross the thin line of forcing it to make fans happy. some might argue that some things happened that were not in the book. true, but please, its a movie, it dose some things for cinematic effect. If you wanted to see a movie exactly like the book then film yourself turning pages for three days, movies have a movie feel, get over it and enjoy it. This film dose everything its supposed to do and i would be surprised if it left a fan disappointed. its is a hell of a story and a work of cinematic art. a must see, and one of the greatest blockbusters we've had in a long time. harry potter is truly astounding",1
354,10.0,"Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 is a great movie as such..........high on action and great acting performances , everybody should give it a try and not discard it by saying ""who cares , i'm not a harry potter fan"" or ""it's kids stuff"" ...........don't miss something for such lame reasons.........give the movie a try and there is a good chance of yours falling in love with the movie . i might also suggest , the movie is good as a solo movie as well.......the story is apparent once you are 10 minutes in the movie , so no need to care a lot about it's being a part 2 movie ,although if u catch up with the story so far ,it will only help you enjoy the movie more .

I think Kloves lost sight of the fact that the books are character driven, not action driven. The Snape memories could have been and should have been more robust, allowing us to really see Snape's love for Lilly Potter and also his loyalty to Dumbledore, his distaste for Dumbledore's seeming willingness to offer Harry as a sacrifice for the greater good and not to mention his own conflict with having agreed to kill Dumbledore.",1

Each beautiful scene that Rowling illustrated in her novel is displayed in full splendor in Yates' adaptation, which will soon become as much a part of the Potter legacy as the novels themselves.

This film is the end of a franchise that lasted more than seven years and earned billions. Yates excellently fulfilled its role but seems to have been a bit dazzled by the special effects. Certainly they have done a great service to the film, but it seems that, in the midst of so many effects and phenomenal camera angles, the script was a bit put away, eventually detaches from reporting the original book. One of the most surprising and unfortunate facts of this film is the radical change in the appearance of some parts of the castle, as its main entrance (which originally wasn't near the Great Hall) and the appearance of the stairs. Throughout the saga and all the books, the castle stairs had the same appearance and the ability to change position, which sometimes took the students to places where they wouldn't (or couldn't) go but, in this film, those so-known stairs gave way to some others, completely different, wider and imposing but that have nothing to do with descriptions of the castle in the books.",0

Fans will not be disappointed, it closes out the franchise perfectly, all the loose ends are tied up, it is clear J.K. Rowling wrote the perfect ending in her book that had all fans very pleased, and David Yates brings it to life perfectly, making it the darkest, most intense of the series. The only issue I felt it had is that some characters are pushed to the side, ones that were significant in previous movies, whose character arch is unfulfilling, such as Minerva, Horace, Sybil and, in particular, Hagrid, one of Harry's closest friends whose screen time was very limited, I understand that they had a lot to go through, but it left me disappointed. I have said before that the cast were always maturing and growing as this series continues, and this is no exception, their performances here are very effective, the young cast members are pure professionals now, living and breathing the lives of their respective roles. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint all shine, as does the ever terrifying Ralph Fiennes, the thrilling Alan Rickman and the charming Michael Gambon, the amount of iconic, unforgetful performances here are spectacular. An action packed, intense and well acted finale, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 to anyone looking for a good adventure or fantasy film. ",1

When I finished watching the preceding Harry Potter movies I was able to grasp and enjoy the plot with a lot of twist. Thus, I was determined to watch the ending movie DH2. But when the movie was done. I tried to feel the atmosphere of the movie house and everyone was quiet. I didn't even hear a whisper or a hush of their excitement watching the final saga of Harry Potter. I was seated to a group of people who was chatting about the story and from the sound of it they have read the book prior to seeing the movie. There are movies that puts you in a position wherein the movie takes you on a journey and it carries you to a ride. I would describe this feel like a ferris wheel.

376,,"This is movie history, never before, and unlikely ever again – a story that took 10 years and 8 movies to tell on the big screen. This last episode is a grand reunion of everybody who has appeared before, alive or now dead (in the story, I mean), from heavy-weights (both meanings) like Gary Oldman (Sirus Black from way back), John Hurt (recent addition Ollivander), Robbie Coltrane (always-there Hagrid) to a cameo, no-dialogue appearance of Harry's one-time love interest Cho Chang portrayed by Katie Leung. It is also with poignant pleasure to witness the last scene (not counting the prologue ""19 years later"") where the trio Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson stand hand-in-hand in front of the ruins that were Hogwarts. No, I was not thinking of Harry, Ron, Hermione, but rather of Daniel, Rupert and Emma who shared what may consider the best part of their young lives growing up together in Rowling's magic realm. What emotion turmoil must have been going through their mind in shooting this last scene together! Having gone through everything with them in a last decade, one really does not expect to have any earth-shattering experience in this last episode. It's rather sitting back to savour the last 2 hours with all these people we have come to know so well (too many to mention) in a somewhat mellowed frame of mind. The movie does deliver, and deserves a verdict of absolutely nothing less than ""completely satisfying"". There are some new things, such as more frequent use of complete silence, or subtle strings hovering at the edge of audio awareness, to create appropriate moods. On the other hand Snipe's real character should be predictable. After all the double-double-double crosses, what final stunning twist revelation can be made other than the one adopted?

I remember when I first saw the (comparatively) light and innocent Sorcerer's Stone. I was nine years old at the time. Here I am, eighteen, and writing the review for the last film, which I saw on Wednesday. I watched over the years as the movies got progressively deeper, more emotional, more mature, and darker, to the level of darkness at which this film is (tone-wise, and light-wise, in certain scenes). The movie picks up where the last movie left off, and covers the last third of the seventh book.

392,10.0,"After seven earlier films reaching back a decade, the Harry Potter saga comes to a solid and satisfying conclusion in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2."" The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" all those magical years ago. Harry, Hermione and Ron are grown up now, and Harry has even grown the facial stubble required of all epic heroes. The time has come for him to face Lord Voldemort in their final showdown, and their conflict is staged in a series of special effects sequences containing power and conviction. I am still not sure what the bolts discharged by magic wands actually consist of, but never mind. They look wicked and lethal. What I can observe is that this final film is a reunion of sorts for a great many characters we've come to know over the years. So many distinguished British actors have played roles in the Potter films that those who haven't may be fitfully resentful. Here we see once again characters whose names were once new and now resonate with associations: Bellatrix Lestrange, Rubeus Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore, Ollivander, Lucius Malfoy, Sirius Black, Severus Snape, Remus Lupin and even Prof. Minerva McGonagall, who is called upon to summon her powers and shield Hogwarts School from the powers of Voldemort. That said, it's apparent again in this film that the three leads are upstaged by the supporting characters. Their role is to be plucky, clean-cut and stalwart. They sneak around and observe things. They eavesdrop. They speculate. They are lectured to. They endure a little low-key puberty. Harry struggles to master his magic. Meanwhile, such British legends as Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes steal scenes just by standing there. What chance does Harry or anybody have against Voldemort's smashed face with its nostril slits? Late in the film, leaving nothing to chance, Voldemort even appears as his own fetus, looking like it's been simmered in red sauce. This entire movie is dark, gloomy and filled with shadows.",1

Other reviewers have done a good job pointing out where they thought the movie was disappointing and I concur with most of those. However, the point which stands out most to me and where I really felt that Yates and his scriptwriters had not read the book properly was when Harry entered the Room of Requirement and found Ravenclaw's diadem. The book quite pointedly says that it was not one of the many glittering tiaras that Harry found. In fact, he was despairing of finding it but then he had a flashback to the fourth book where there was a mannequin with a dusty old crown on it's head. There was no reason to make it a glittering one in a box, it would not have taken more time to stick to the story with this particular scene. The movie really did feel that Yates just wanted to get it out of the way and do it as cheaply as possible ( since there would be no more prospects of making mints of money off future movies). It's a shame and I feel that if they had put Cuaron in as director and made it a 3 hour film like some of the earlier ones, they could have made one of the greatest finale movies ever which would have made them more money over the long term ( instead of having to sell it for $10 which is the price I bought it at).

Vodemort, having desecrated Dumbledore's tomb, steals the most powerful ""Elder"" wand, but it later turns out that he is not it's true owner, as Draco killed Dumbledore and Harry defeated him. Dumbledore was stricken with a fatal spell anyway, so it is more of a mercy-killing than a murder, but that's yet another story. There is a touching scene where Harry gets to meet both of his dead parents through a Resurrection Stone hidden inside of the ""Snitch"". Voldemort eventually discovers that the Elder Wand does not cooperate and won't obey all his commands. He kills Harry Potter, as Harry is the unwilling recipient of a part of Voldemorts' soul. He dies, but meets Dumbledore at a ""half-way-station"" on the way to Heaven. He is given the choice to return to the living or move on to the next level of existence. He chooses life. There is a huge battle scene. Both Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are destroyed and many Death Eaters and good Wizards are killed in this battle. As Hagrid carries Harry (who appears dead) he springs back to life and has a ""Wizards' Battle to the Death"" with Voldemort, as the last Parsal-Snake is killed with the Magic Sword of Griffindore. Harry wisely destroys the Elder Wand by breaking it in half, and throws it into the water, as not even a Wizard should have that much power or live forever. In the epilogue, Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione send their children to Hogwarts 19 years later. A most satisfying ending and Draco sends his white-haired son to Hogwarts as well! A long but very fast-moving action film that is totally spell-binding!",1
414,10.0,They movie is excellent to begin with! They did justice to it as both a movie for children and adults! Thought the ppl who read the book must have been disappointed with the climax. 1) its voldermort and not Mr Bean!! Voldermort looked like a joke!! Hugging malfoy like an old freak?? seriously?? His laughter had no sinister feel behind it! ,1

416,,My wife and I went to see the DH2 on her birthday. I was hopeful that David Yates would have broken his dismal track record with Harry Potter. My hopes were dashed early on when Mr. Ollivander talked about the Deathly Hallows instead of just the Elder Wand. It was also clear that Harry's Holly and Phoenix Feather wand was not going to reappear since Harry didn't ask Ollivander about fixing it. Of coursing blowing past Harry's birthday party and not allowing Hagrid to give Harry the mokeskin pouch in DH1 pretty much called that shot.,1

418,10.0,Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the absolute exclamation point on the entire series and HP movies. It successfully uncovers all of the remaining and missing context to tie everything that has happened until now perfectly. All story lines and character development are tied in perfectly. Obviously it's largely due to the writing of the books but the movie and entire series does the best possible job bringing it to life. This is by far the best and most well done movie of the series and one of the most entertaining movies I have ever watched.

This movie is probably the most emotional, because of a few deaths of characters we've gotten to know over the years, and because it's the final chapter. There was a scene in the middle where I shed a few tears. This movie picks up exactly where Part 1 ended. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still on the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live. This has been a great decade journey. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2!!!",1

422,,"The final entry into cinema's hugest phenomenon, HPATDH:P2 is also the best in the franchise. The action is unlike anything you've seen in the Potter universe before; the showdown at Hogwarts is worth the price of admission all on its own. The characters are all given suitably memorable moments in their last outing – Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Julie Walter's Molly Weasley are allowed to get their badass on, which is, quite simply, awesome – and there's a nice little epilogue that provides a fitting finale for the main trio at the centre of it all.

Great scenes from Alan Rickman (one of the best in my opinion). Deep and tender, even sad story from him, of course it comes from Rowling. But still good. Also the battles, every each and single little one is epic, and shows what each wizard is capable to do for real. You have not to think anymore, now you have the proves. Maggie Smith, epic too.

The creativity in the Hogwarts battle is good, but still it cannot provide the super surprising, astonishing and logical explanations for everything has happened from the start to the last moments. 3D effects are good, but not as good as in Avatar.

This is an incredibly impressive feat to make an entire book series into a film series with literally only one recast. I refer of course to Michael Gambon's recast as Albus Dumbledore, but that is only because his predecessor, Richard Harris, passed away. The series has seen its highs with works of art like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which proved that this was no longer a small time family series, to the terribly unconvincing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which showed us how awkward the series could be.

It never ceases to amaze me, how a director , making millions of dollars, can make such a colossal blunder.",1

I never read any complete book, although i did have a very close contact with some very freak fans of the series, so i know what their motivations are. The discussion of these harder fans moves around how each knew film was or not able to grasp all the contents of the book, and produce the image(s) that the book suggested to each reader. Or was it acceptable to leave certain elements of the story that a film Always has to leave behind. I never cared about those arguments, because the films create a universe of their own, slightly close to the one in the books, which can even coincide at some moment, but still autonomous. So in a way, the books are to the films, as Hogwarts is to the real world In the films. Rooted in it, but no It. ",1

It wasn't like the book, but it was better on screen that way. Very exciting, very touching (especially if you're a hardcore fan, like me) and very vivid vision of the last chapters of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". I cried several times, I admit it, and I would never be ashamed to say I did, because ""Harry Potter"" is with me more than 10 years and I couldn't have imagine that it will end so perfectly on the big screen. I loved the Tale of the Prince, the scene where Snape was hugging Lily. I loved the kiss between Ron and Hermione in the Chamber of Secrets after they've destroyed the Horcrux. I loved the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, with all the extra, exciting scenes that weren't in the book. I loved the ending scene, with the old Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco. Basically, I loved the whole thing so much, that this is probably my favorite Harry Potter film - EVER. I cried at the ending seeing the old faces of my favorite heroes and I cried because there's no more Harry Potter. Thank you J. K. Rowling for creating this wonderful and magical world, that will always be my second home no matter what I do, wherever I go or which other book or world I discover.

456,8.0,"Taken on its own, it might be a little too much in terms of ""epic moments"" with something seemingly momentous occurring every few minutes. But in conjunction with Part 1, which feels rather uneventful, it probably makes more sense. It seems like a lot of the fat is gone, and from what I can recall of the book, it's edited down nicely into digestible chunks without too much exposition. More importantly, the godawful epilogue is actually transformed into something decent, without that misguided compulsion to tie everything up into neat little bows. Yes, some bits throughout are going to be rather confusing to anyone not familiar with the source material, but they're not really the intended audience anyway. Production values are high, as one would one expect, with massive battles that only occasionally get too busy. I would definitely prefer to watch this back-to-back with Part 1, but that time will come when the inevitable Super Ultra Mega Edition Blu-Ray box set is released.",0

After ten or so somber minutes of recapping the last film, this last hurrah starts off strong as the characters infiltrate a magical vault, before moving along to the ultimate Battle of Hogwarts. As far as finales go, I wouldn't dare rank the Hogwarts battle over my other favorite scenes. Even though it takes up over twenty minutes of screen time, something about the final battle didn't really strike me as exceptional; I suspect it's because the actual fighting is subdued to the background, with no real sense of progression, variety, or true peril. But after some sporadic bursts of fighting and mystery, the film finally gets into the final duel between Potter and Voldemort, which is pretty damn cool. There are also a number of other epic moments in the film that'll keep it lively, and will enthrall most die-hard fans. I felt there could have been a bigger punch, and there are just a few scenes that drag, but what we get is satisfying.",1

It was nice to see the other characters, most of whom who have been in the franchise since Philosopher's Stone get more screen time and be more involved in the story especially Neville the unexpected hero. The last battle scene was just epic and the reasoning of how Harry was able to defeat Voldemort was amazing and well written.

A seething evil entity who does not know the word lay down and die already. With hog warts at the brink of destruction, Harry and his team must find key elements to quell Voldemorts life force which are bound to a cup, a snake, a tiara, and Harry himself. A brilliant look into the past of Snape (Alan Rickman) who was in love with Harry's mother first Lily (Geraldine Sommerville) but never got to go further than friendship, gave us a peek as to who really was Harry's real father. Whether it was Snape, or was it James Potter (Adrian Rawlins). We will never know, yet the battles were breath taking, with magical wands at full strength, and soul eaters flying across the field looking for more victims. This was truly a marvel in itself. A wonderful story, fantastic acting from legendary actors such as Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Maggie smith, Tom Felton, Gary Oldman and many many others. This is a pinnacle of film making. But the last part was by far the best, where Harry and his team are now Mothers and Fathers to their own children, sending them off to hog warts. Maybe in the future, a new evil presence will show itself, to give the new age a brand of justice in their own way. And it is all thanks to Radcliff, Grint, Watson and above all, J.K Rowling, the mastermind behind the books and movies, thank you Rowling for so many years of expanding the imaginations of children from all around the world.",1

If I could go back and count it'd have to be at least seven times I felt my heart break, and then I realized that my childhood was coming to a close during the epilogue. It's been awhile since a movie has emotionally effected me that much. The performances in this film are so powerful and thrilling (namely Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Rickman), the detail of the film's location, costumes, art direction, music, and mostly cinematography blow all of other films out of the water.

With the final installment, the cast and crew pulled out all the stops to try to deliver the most epic film in the entire saga. The drama, tension, and action were revved up to the maximum to compete with the final book—which was also a plethora of drama, suspense, and resolution.

The first half hour - hour or so is not only quite accurate, but also really good, but as the Battle of Hogwats begins everything go downhill. It is all just a blur of people running around screaming and shouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you should care about, but can't in this mess, are dead and not even after the battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people we worried about and that at least I felt sorry for while reading the book.",0

It was a perfect way to end the series that we all know and love so much. The drama, the romance, the suspense, the thrills, the action, and everything that makes the last Harry Potter film, the best of the best. The film is also excellent for its secrets finally revealed, and all the surprises that are spilled out. The movie was brilliantly directed by the wonderful David Yates, and it was expertly written by the unique Steve Kloves. Both Yates and Kloves bring back the dark adventures of Harrry, Ron, & Hermione for the very last time. And similar to Part 1, it also takes us back to the many wonderful and charming icons from the previous films, and has all returned for a more dark and epic version of the story. It made us all look back at the whimsical magic since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" at the very beginning. And let's not forget the awesome cinematography, and spectacular visual effects, and all the amazing well-written scenes that bring the legacy of Harry Potter back to life. And also, it's our last chance to join the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they set on their final chapter of their lives at Hogwarts. You have seen them grow throughout the years, and now they are facing serious sacrifices. Now, the movie was the best Harry Potter flick I've seen in years, and it will always bring back a precious childhood memory of the previous movies that we have all grown up with. So, this epic tale of courage, fear, faith, and power is all wrapped up into this wonderful package that we call ""The Harry Potter Finale"".

477,8.0,"It brought me back to how it all started. To how I come to be a Harry Potter fan by reading the books as well after watching the first film. The theme music from the first film which was played when the credits rolled in was a reminder of the more innocent times, of how like many in the fandom, we have come to grow together with the characters. But there has to come a time where the series has to end.",1
478,5.0,"I have always been a huge fan of the books. The movies have always been good as well, although they have been in steady decline since the third. The story was good, and followed the books reasonably well. However, its production was over-dramatic, to the point where it was quite cheesy at times. I found myself laughing at parts that were meant to be taken seriously, as they were too drawn out and tried too hard to be gripping. I also felt some of the acting, particularly that by Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), was quite horrible. A disappointing finish to the series.",0

480,7.0,"Some of the kiddies here were quite impressed by this film. Indeed, it is among the best of the series, but it is not a masterpiece of cinema. It is a competent adaptation of the novels into film. In fact, the last book was transformed into two films to milk the franchise as much as possible which therefore reduce the artistic accomplishments of these films.",1
481,10.0,"As a film lover I purposely avoided all Harry Potter content, seeing them as children's films and books. Then it suddenly bothered me that I didn't have a popular franchise in my collection Gawd damn, I found I loved this new wizarding world, Deathly Hallows Pt 2 took my breath away I loved the final battle good Vs Evil. No this isn't The Infinity saga. Even so it stands as great entertainment in its ownbright.",1
482,9.0,"Normally, stories struggle to finish their story for several reasons, sometimes it stretches out a lot, other times it is rushed, the writter doesnt know how to end things, the ending doesnt make sense, etc. Fortunately, this didnt happen with the HP franchise. Dividing the final book into 2 parts was a great decision, which made everything run more natural, it doesnt feel rushed in any aspect and the closure all the characters have is great. The story concludes how it should, it doesnt leave anything to interpretation and there are no unresolved plots left or anything. It is so satisfactory to see how this movie made evrything work, and connected a lot of little details form the previous movies. I think the 3rd and 4rth are objectively better made, but this one is an asolite banger filled with action and excitement.",1

484,9.0,"Wow, what a finale. I actually watched both Deathly Hallows films back to back to try and generate as close to book experience as possible, and while doing that has made it difficult for me to differentiate between them, as a combined single entry they completely blow away the rest of the saga. Everything is tied up nicely, the final battle scene is amazing, and there is a perfect blend of action, suspense and heart. An amazing end to the series and possibly my favourite film of the lot. Now to leave it a few years then read the books...",1

This grand finale manages to unravel everything that the movies were building up to in spectacular fashion with amazing battles and visuals that modern movie makers can only dream of. My only critic is that Snape and Albus died to suddenly and quickly without a longer introduction and prepareness. All in all, 8/10",1

488,,"The movie deserves a 1 but out of my compassion to the die-hard HP fans, I'm giving it a 2. I'm not a huge fan of the series, but I love the genre. This last movie is like the last movie in LOTR- the first was infinitely better and had some depth and proper pacing. But like Pt2 and 3 of LOTR, this last Harry Potter was replete with slow sequences, and unconvincing acting by almost all the characters. There were so many scenes with Harry just staring into space (seemingly in deep thought). The whole film seemed to lack the quality.. seemed a bit hastily put together. Reminds me of Return of the Jedi versus Star Wars... the acting by Solo and Leia and even Luke was horrible and seemed disinterested in the 3rd movie. And the movie's battles in many ways reminded me 2nd and 3rd LOTR, and very much like X-men 3. One of my biggest problems was with Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldermort- sorry but I kept seeing a guy with a stupid mask on and he just didn't look authentic- it reminded me of the Darth Maul in Star Wars Ep 1. Like Darth Maul, he just looks like the writer was trying to create a character who looks as grotesque as possible, but neither scary or persuasive- just ugly and painful to look at- like a burn victim or someone who had a facial deformity. Actually he was the least scary and least interesting evil character- just like Darth Maul was. But the main problem I had with the movie was the tempo- so slow sometimes and too fast other times. I guarantee that unless you are a die hard Harry Potter fan (and I know this will be sacrilege to you) you will feel squirmy in your seat and want the movie to just hurry up and end in the 2nd half. A few more spells cast would have been great, instead of the usual fire shooting from the magic wand routine- snore.",0

Nowadays i'm in Egypt_thanx 2 my dad_ I decided to go to the cinema, from the first scene of the movie i was like glued to my seat, I loved the dark atmosphere of the movie, it gave another taste to the movie, another thing is the battle scenes i was blown off how amazing are they, the only drawback is the 3D thing, you know these kinds of movies needs you to be concentrated to the details and you must live the dark atmosphere that this film provides, but the 3D effects weren't bad but I'd prefer if the released it in 2D but whatever money talks in these situations.

495,8.0,"Not only is this the best of the Potter films, but it made me overall appreciate the films and Rowling's novels with much more appreciation. The biggest problems with the other Potter films was over-length and ineffective juxtaposition, but this chapter suffers from neither. Yates is as fast-paced as ever and he blends multiple elements together effectively. The movie is spellbinding and grabs you from the start, not wandering like its precursor and gets us pretty much on every level. The special effects are as good as always and seeing the story go full circle is a comforting event that leaves us satisfied with the saga.",1
496,8.0,"Loved the start of HP7II, but should have paid closer attention (or read the books) to truly appreciate the middle bit. Loved Maggie Smith stepping through the crowd to battle evil. Flanked by an all-star team of UK performers, most all of whom have at least one moment in a sea of appearances. The finale doesn't disappoint either. Didn't much care for the obligatory epilogue, but as it is from the book, Potterfiles would decry its exclusion. Shame that greed and length had to portion this film out in parts, as taken together they are remarkable; broken in two, slightly diminished in impact. Rather like taking a year long intermission at a wonderful play.",1
497,10.0,"An amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the Harry Potter series. Of course, the books were far superior in every way but these last couple of movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind every scene which the earlier films couldn't quite do. The acting continued to improve in every film as did the development of the overall story arc and characters. I also felt like this was the best movie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully engage in the story. Overall, I am very glad that I was able to complete the book series and films. This entire process has been an enjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of entertainment, isn't it? To enjoy it? That's always been my belief and this story was absolutely captivating. I can't wait until the next time I can make it to Universal Studios to check out what I've heard is an amazing job at recreating the environment. Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing premium entertainment for my mind!",1
498,2.0,"This movie (the 2 parts) is an absolute disgrace. It does not respect the book, it does not respect the world of Harry Potter. It's just a big joke, they decided to cut half of the book, including some important scenes, but they also decided to change what happens and when it happens. They added stuff and made some impossible things possible in the movie. In the end, it's a movie showing off all you can do special effect-wise, they focused on that and chose the scenes they would do from the books based on whether they would allow theme to show off or not, and left big chunks of the story. I re-read the book just before and it's just a shocking movie in the end. I can not believe JK Rowling said yes to that. She must really like money. But it's not like it's a new thing in the Harry Potter series. Half of the movies are lame, disrespectful to the original world, and focused on minor parts while leaving important story parts left abandoned.",0

508,7.0,"* This review is for all the series not only the last film* After watching every film in the series I would say they are very good films but there is a lot missing from the books a lot of details! But surely I would recommend watching the films ""after"" reading the books, because sometimes you feel there are missing pieces and if you did not read the books you will have a difficult time to understand what is happening, Also there is much more in the story did come up in the films like most of Dobby the elf story never mentioned till the end and the whole elf story and making them free! Enjoy watching you will miss it when you finish :(",1
509,,"""It all ends."" So reads the succinct tagline for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Capping a decade and eight blockbuster adaptations, Warner Bros. and director David Yates have finally put the franchise to bed. This is Potter's final hour, but is it also his finest?",0
510,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 isn't just a great fantasy film, but it's also a great film as it understands how to wrap up a once-in-a-lifetime franchise. The acting of the main three stars has improved so much that you really can't get enough of them. Snape probably gets the most amount of depth in this film, which makes the whole viewing experience of the franchise completely different. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is fantastic as Voldemort as he really goes above and beyond to kill Harry Potter and survive on his own. One of the best parts of the movie is the Courtyard Apocalypse scene as, accompanied by incredible music, it shows the trio going through Hogwarts and facing almost every possible emotion that you could think of. This movie has some of the most satisfying moments in the franchise you wish had happened sooner. Prepare to be feel all kinds of emotions hit you in this epic conclusion to the amazing franchise.",1
511,8.0,"All those Harry Potter movies were okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but this was easily the best of all the Harry Potter movies in the franchise, being the most entertaining and satisfying. I really liked the last scene.",1
512,8.0,"This movie, about Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger who search for Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes in their effort to destroy the Dark Lord as the final battle rages on at Hogwarts, is a great ending to the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011).",1

516,10.0,"When the first Harry Potter book came out the 30th June 1997, no one not even JK Rowling herself could have predicted the storm that would follow as millions of people of all ages from the young to the elderly fell in love with the fictional character of Harry Potter along with Ron, Hermione and all the other characters throughout the seven book series. Told in books, played through computer games and now turned into movies with websites, forums and fan clubs based on ""the boy who lived,"" Harry Potter has become an iconic symbol of British/world culture with the values of trust, honesty, friendship, love and courage lots of human beings show everyday. The character has been and will continue to enrich all our lives for pure enjoyment for generations to come as well as being a terrific role model for younger kids.",1
517,6.0,"This is the end of a series that is famous around the world, the childhood of many young people around the world, I understand the director's burden when making this film. Especially since this is a movie adaptation of a book. The visual effects are quite nice, but the battle scenes all take place in dark places, making me sometimes feel uncomfortable, just hoping for a quick morning. The action scenes in the movie are also not very interesting. And there are a few things I don't really like, why are the villains always ""waiting for so long"" when they take the initiative? Don't they want it to be over quickly? Sometimes I feel that Voldemort is so lenient, from the moment he let Horcrux into Bellatrix's bank, did he trust Bella that much? Doesn't look like a bad guy at all. And did he even let Neville finish his speech? And I wonder why Harry Potter is affected by wearing the Horcrux necklace when he himself is a Horcrux? And couldn't the dialogue between Hermione, Ron, and Harry get funnier when Harry talks about how he's going to go into the woods to meet Voldemort again? Lol If she was that worried about Harry, she would have run into the woods or did something instead of sitting still and asking ""I thought you were in the woods?"" As for the character of Professor Snape, I know the intention to transform the villain (or so most of us thought) of the previous 7 films into a kind character who sacrifices for others and becomes a ""silent hero"". I don't know how things play out in the book, but this transformation in the movie was so sudden, and I still couldn't adapt my emotions to empathize with the character of Snape. Mrs. Rowling probably wanted people to think well of teachers who were strict but loved and wanted the best for their students. But if you want an audience like me to sympathize with a person who is willing to sacrifice and suffer injustice for love and then wants to clear it up by ""take my tears, let you know the truth"", it seems bit too much. This character is more confusing to me than memorable. In general, the film is quite lengthy, the film circuit is simple and I personally feel this part is not as good as the previous one. Many people say this part is better than the book, so I should feel lucky that I didn't read it.",1
518,,"There's a lot of ""sniffiness"" around the Harry Potter franchise - perhaps because of its history as a children's fantasy book; and I feel tiny pangs of guilt even now in recalling going to see ""another fnarring kids film"" way back when the first film hit our screens.",1
519,,"Unlike so many 'Potterheads' out there, I can't call myself a die-hard fan of the series. Yes, I have enjoyed the films greatly, but I have never read a single book, nor have I devoted time to following every piece of Potter news. So, this review comes from someone who has enjoyed the films as a fan of movies. And this final chapter is truly an enjoyable spectacle that brings the series to a wonderful close.",1
520,,"Just like the previous 2 Harry Potter films Deathly Hallows Part 2 was a big disappointment. Again many important and dramatic parts of the story were left out. So many things were changed from the book itself, and that took away so much from the story and made the movie disappointing. I can't understand how so many people found this movie to be so wonderful. I found myself during the movie just shaking my head at how things were done in the movie. If you have read the book and enjoyed the story you will probably find this movie to be so disappointing in so many ways. Don't take my word for it though. Go and see it for yourself, but don't expect too much from it.",0

So in this chapter we reach the climax of a battle that had been building up to this boiling point. It's finally come down to Harry vs Voldemort. First of all the characters make this movie and the entire saga legendary, as they all have their remarkable characteristics and personal conflicts.

Secondly, the entire work and effort put into bringing this fantastic tale to life, ranging from production to direction. It all flows perfectly.",1
524,7.0,"Finales of this magnitude usually come about once every few years for television shows, but very rarely for feature films. However, this is most certainly the case for the epic conclusion to the Harry Potter saga, filled with equal parts fan-servicing closure and genuinely emotive scenes for those less devout followers like myself. Personally, the film falls short of being the ultimate achievement in filmmaking it would've aspired to, but that does not mean it wasn't an exciting and overly engaging movie from start to finish.",1
525,9.0,"Part 2 of the final installment of the Harry Potter series begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue their quest of tracking down and destroying Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes, the dark magical items posed as everyday things that are responsible for his immortality. But as the legendary Deathly Hallows are uncovered, Voldemort finds out about their mission, the fight of good against evil will come to an explosive end. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off, searching for Horcruxes. I was never really a fan of the Horcruxes plot line, but I had always tolerated it as I read the novels because even though it felt like a plot line that would be in a sub-par video game, it still felt planned, thanks to Tom Riddle's diary back in Chamber of Secrets. The Horcruxes plot line also worked well on the pages, because they were spread out in the book. However, on screen, it felt repetitive and tedious, with little to no break in between each one, especially in Part 2. Part 1 was an atmospheric and emotional movie, and even though it was basically a prelude to the conclusion of the series, it stood alone as a film rather well. Part 2 was supposed to be action-packed and also emotional, and while it was action-packed (although it felt like it took forever to get there), it wasn't as emotional as I had hoped it would be. The film felt a bit rushed and was single-noted. Part 2 is the shortest Potter installment, and it felt like it. Many scenes left me wanting more. The single-noted aspect made the film feel incomplete. It felt like it was strictly about Horcruxes and the Potter/Voldemort confrontation, with some other sub-plots barely sprinkled in. Maybe if they hadn't split the film in two, but made it one long film, it would have felt more complete. The acting was as solid as ever, with Daniel Radcliffe giving his best performance of the series. Ralph Fiennes was as evil as ever and Alan Rickman gave his best performance in the series too, as Snape. Everyone else was solid as well, but unfortunately we don't get to see them nearly as much, which was a shame. The visual effects were top-notch and can only be rivaled by Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The spell-casting, creatures, and explosions were dazzling and suitably, magical. Some of the CGI was a bit spotty, but I honestly can remember only one instance and it literally lasted two seconds. I loved that the film was all about how there is darkness in all of us, but we can learn how to overcome it. We learn quickly that no character in this series (including Dumbledore) is totally pure, and Harry must completely accept this or else he will fail. Overall, as a film, it's a good one. But when you deal with sequels and a series, as well as the most famous book series of all time, as well as expectation, Part 2 doesn't make the grade. I expected a lot more, and didn't get it. It felt rushed and wasn't at all cathartic, which is what a Potter fan who not only grew up reading the books but grew up watching the films as well was deserving of. There are a lot of variables as to why the film was not excellent, and one could argue Book 7 was one of the weaker books anyway. Still, it's a good movie and whenever you deal with an ending people are very critical if it is not exactly they way they envisioned it. Harry Potter was one of the greatest film series of all time, and even though Part 2 wasn't the best, I'm still satisfied with the series as a whole, which stuck to the books faithfully, upheld Rowling's wishes, stuck with the same actors, and above all, stayed consistently great with four different directors and the transition from kid-friendly to much, much darker themes. That is an achievement unto itself. In the 10 years since Harry's big-screen debut, the spell has never been broken.",1

527,10.0,"I just saw the movie and I have to admit that it is an impressive film, it has it all. Unlike the more recent prequels, this time we enjoyed a good story and not just teen romance. This film has a visual quality that is worthy of 3D. It has great colors and textures, although it is known that it was not done from the beginning in this format but it is still pretty good at it. The picture is a bit dark, I hope it's only because of the 3D glasses. If you did not read the book you can see that this history is full of surprises, twists and unexpected and exciting moments. However I recommend that if children are going to see this movie they do it only in the company of their parents because of certain scenes which area a bit strong, specifically deaths. I'm sure every fan of the series who watch this movie will be pleased and those who are not will also enjoy it very much. I feel fortunate to have been part of this part of history for the cinema, no doubt this latest movie is the best of all of the eight. It is full of information, emotions, romance, drama, fights and everything that is entertaining and heartwarming we can think of.

So when I saw Deathly Hallows part 2, it was everything I thought it would be: not much. The entire movie is basically one big scene. I have no idea why they would promote it as an entire movie, because it is just not. Walking out of the cinema I felt disappointed beyond believe. There is nothing that makes this movie ( scene ) special at all. Although I must say that the acting of most of the actors is pretty good.

535,10.0,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a very good movie I have read the books too and the books are better than the movies but this movie is very good and it is the best book and movie in the whole series.,1
536,1.0,"The Gringotts Dragon....are you kidding me? I could see the combination of plastic and paper maché from the back row. And the storyline was not followed in the most crucial part of the saga, the ending. Do we really need that many scenes of Ron and Hermoine, and Harry and Ginnie, getting all mushy like every ten to fifteen minutes? And Daniel Radcliff needs to stop trying to be a hero, you are and will always be a lame, end of discussion. I hope someone remakes the seven (I can't call them movies) pieces of trash who actually can stick to the story line with a set of real actors. Don't call me a harry potter hater because I love the books, for those who haven't read the books , this ""trash"" makes the book out to be not worth reading, while to those who did read the books, this ""trash"" makes it a disgusting portrayal of what did not even happen in the books.

538,9.0,"I don't even know how to begin this review of mine, but let me just start by saying this-- for fans of the decade-long ""Harry Potter"" saga, everything all comes down to this final movie. I've spent the entire week re-watching all seven previous films to prepare for this last movie.",0

540,,"Who would have thought in 2001 that in 2011 we would be expecting HP 8 to be the biggest film of the year, smashing all box office records before it? And yet, here we are, with the same characters and almost exactly the same cast, consistent across the whole franchise. Dumbledore being effectively replaced by Michael Gambon, due to the death of Richard Harris After abruptly leaving audiences in mid story in Part 1, have the loose ends been tied and a resounding and satisfying finale been served? The short answer is yes with some relatively minor caveats.",1
541,7.0,"We have finally come to the last page of J.K. Rowling's epic saga. Thiz is the final adventure of wonder boy wizard Harry Potter. The seventh and last book split into two separate movies. To be honest, it's very hard to criticize since the movies were shot back-to-back. In other words, these movies are actually one movie. The opening sequence has a very slow pace of storytelling which allows every detail can be described better. There is no need for further explanation. The story starts right away, showing the preparation of dark lord to hunt Harry Potter and the dark atmosphere surrounding Hogwarts which is now ruled by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continue on their journey to find the last Horcruxes. The story eventually has some twists to throw at the end of the movie, but for most of the fans it will not be a twist anymore since they had already read the series books before thiz movie. The final battle between Harry Potter and the dark lord himself is one of the most highly anticipated scenes. The long awaited climax event is perfectly told, it looks like Daniel Radcliffe has done his best, but I think what makes that final scene so intense is also a splendid acting improvisation by Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Thiz movie is still directed by David Yates who has been the Director of thiz epic since ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) and, of course, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: Part 1"" (2010). Once again, thiz franchise has already become a part of each and every one of us. You will easily agree thiz statement (Spoiler Alert!), especially when we come to the end of the movie which tells Harry Potter, his wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), Ron and Hermione send their children off to Hogwarts school from platform 3 ¾. In that very moment, we realize what we've just seen is not just Harry Potter, but it is all of us who have become older and mature during thiz franchise. Be proud to be Harry Potter's generation! ",1
542,7.0,"Ten years after its debut, the Harry Potter film franchise has drawn to a close. The dedicated fan-based generated by the book series of the same name has been subject to a fairly consistent variety of offerings, but never (in my estimation, at least) has any one of the pictures ventured into the realm of being truly ""bad."" Thankfully, the same can be said for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Is it epic? Not at all. But it is a slam-bang finale that—for the most part— satisfies.",0
543,,"It seems hard to conceive that we have reached the end of an era, a decade long conflict of good versus evil, and during this time having witnessed the growth to adulthood of a generation of wizards. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) with his closest friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and constant nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) all met with their destiny head on, and the final battles were epic. The Harry Potter story is now completed, but there are so many other characters that could take us back to the wizarding world. I have mixed feelings about anyone attempting to recreate something as amazing as this series, since it most likely would not measure up. Even though some of the supporting characters did not have much depth as compared to the primary wizards it was still nice to see them in the final story, Neville (Matthew Lewis), Dean (Alfie Enoch), Seamus (Devon Murray), and the Weasleys, the whole red-headed lot of them. I have to mention that even though Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) is an evil b!tch, she was one of my favorite characters because of how richly animated she is portrayed. The visual effects in this film were phenomenal, I was aware that there was a dragon in the story, having seen it in the trailer, but I had never in my wildest imaginings ever considered what an emaciated dragon would or could look like. It was so life like in demeanor and mobility that it elicited sympathy from me. This film as those before it introduced some other mythical creatures, and revisited the Goblins, but I have to say this. I hate to divulge anything that may ruin a film for other viewers, but what I thought was missing were the Centaurs, they were there in the beginning, again in the middle so I thought it only fitting that they should have been there in the end. The absence of the Centaurs did not diminish the quality of this story in any way. This story as written by J.K. Rowling, the screenplay as developed by Steve Kloves, and the direction of David Yates have provided movie goers with an absolute gem. This movie is a perfect example of exceptional fantasy adventure film making. The Boy who lived has taken us on a magical journey that will never be forgotten. I would give this film a double green light if it could make it any clearer that this film is superb.",1
544,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is absolutely breathtaking! David Yates has been a favorable director for these films, and he really showcased his talents here. He crafted so many gorgeous shots, with a couple new creative tricks, while Mark Day's editing was absolutely seamless, really knitting the scenes together beautifully.",1
545,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great film because it has all the components of a well-built story - an action-packed beginning, a suspenseful climax, and a resolution that brings closure to the series. At the beginning of the movie, the audience is immediately met with action. For example, while hunting for the Hufflepuff cup, Harry Potter is almost drowned by trophies, attacked by death eaters, and escapes on a dragon (Harry Potter). As the movie progresses, the audience is met with the climax: Harry Potter and Voldemort's final battle. In the film, Harry Potter greets Voldemort by saying, ""Let us finish this as we started, Tom - - together"" (Harry Potter). This quote from the movie shows strong suspense because Voldemort and Harry Potter are dueling for the last time and the outcome of this final battle brings closure to the series. After Voldemort is defeated, the audience is left wondering what Harry's next plan is regarding the elder wand. When asked what he plans to do with it by Ron and Hermione, Harry responds by breaking it in half and throwing it into the abyss (Harry Potter). This represents the resolution of the movie because Harry Potter is breaking the most powerful wand in the world, showing that he doesn't deem its use necessary. Overall, the film showcases a well-built story and leaves nothing open for interpretation. Past readers and viewers will enjoy this last film of the series!",1
546,9.0,"This is the best Harry Potter movie. It a spectacular finale! The incredibly emotional snape flashback/horcrux twist is the biggest moment of the entire series. The Later, darker Harry Potter movies are fantastic. This movie makes the entire series worth watching, and is one of my favorite movies of all time.",1
547,,"This final movie in the Harry Potter franchise constitutes a very impressive effort from the part of the creative team. It is full of poignant and memorable scenes while the battle scenes remind one of the artistry of ""The Lord of the Rings"".",1

And lets do this movie the best Harry Potter/And any other movie that exist in IMDb, I think that this movie deserves a 9.2-9.4 something like that so lets set a review to this movie and try to do this the best movie ever! Im not saying this cause I'm a Hp fan its much more then that, If I didn't like the movie i would say give it bad result's, bur as I expect it was amazing amazingly done, and I think every Hp fan and not Hp fans will think so, cause one of my friends didn't like harry potter, bur when he tried to see this he thought it was amazing, but he didn't like the previously movies so much! So ya go and see the movie.",1
549,10.0,"So well made,dark, totally exceeded expectations , tight screenplay and the splendid on-screen adaptation of The Prince's Tale, HP7.2 has finished a saga which kept us cheering and clapping in many of the jaw-dropping sequences...it was a first-day-first-show, and a house-full at IMAX 3D screen, and I was moved by the spirit of the people...the depressing Voldemort declaring Potter dead, brought a silence in the theater, but the next scene which followed, was so superbly shown that we were rooting: Go Harry! Daniel Radcliffe turned out to be a fine boy-wizard , his expressions were up-to-the-mark totally! Alan Rickman scored and Ralph Fiennes will forever be remembered as the darkest villain of all time! Not much to act by Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, but Matthew Lewis surprises( hit like striking a sixer by Sachin!)",1
550,10.0,"This movie is probably my favorite finale to a franchsie of all-time. This film has very few flaws and even improves upon the book in my opinion. I actually think it was as perfect as it could have been, especially considering the expectations for this movie. There's really nothing more to say except that this was the perfect sendoff, and I hope they don't screw up the entire franchise with the Fantastic Beast movies (unlikely after that horrific second film).",1
551,7.0,"So I watched the mega blockbuster finale to the Harry ""the nerd sorcerer"" Potter saga ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" from 2011. So was this movie good, I say abracadabra bitch, or yes in muggle speak. I have seen every Harry Potter movie and enjoyed them all. I especially like how the movies (and I guess the books to) have matured with each passing film. They also went from somewhat structured like in the sorcerers stone to less predictable and original as time has passed. I saw this last one in IMAX 3D, I personally found the 3D to not be mind blowing, which I think is common among films not shot in 3D. So if I was you I would save the cash and see this in regular boring ole' 2D. So this movie just like the others is a little dark, has fascinating characters, a mystery to be solved and mysteries to be revealed. This movie delivers these Harry standards in spades. This movie was enjoyable except for the final scene for me. I won't spoil it but it is taken from the final books epilogue. It seemed tacked on and kind of pointless. I personally think much like star wars we have not seen the last Harry Potter film. I see the next one coming in about 10 years after the next Harry book by Rowling comes out called ""Harry Potter and the quest to find something else to write that failed and the search for more money."" I think the next one should be R with a little graphic interracial (muggle on wizard) hardcore action. So this movie is a worthy ending to the series, it answers all the questions, has a wide demographic base from young to old from magic nerd to jock. So go enjoy and be nerdy for a couple of hours, but just don't start here these movies for the most part should be watched in order. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",1
552,9.0,This movie is beautiful. Not perfect but very good,1
553,,"Taken alone, this is a good, fun, action movie...the action rarely stops (as opposed to Part 1 where it never started).",1
554,10.0,the whole series was amazing i just like all the part and there is no reason to unlike it. there is no movie like this who just made magic to a another level and everything just beyond end is good everything is perfect that's it full entertainment and more then entertainment. however my favorite scene was from part 3 that time travel and harry and hermini travels to time to make things perfect that was my favorite scene in whole but i like it at all when you start watching first time first part you feel very amazing mostly when i see that pictures scene it just like real type gif files etc. but very real however maybe it can possible with technology not now not here but in future it will not all but some or more then some. the biggest story ever and and every part is interested that scene was quite funny when they are showing them selves after 19 year they are not looking old at all.,1
555,9.0,"I was Quite thrilled to watch the the series end.The three musketeers have grown and given their best in this final film.while Alan Rikman perfectly portrayed the character of Severus Snape, his memories is the heart of the film.special effects are rocking.The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. Neville cutting the head of Nagina is the show stealer.Dir. David Yates shows his brilliance in this film after a bit let down in Half Blood Prince.Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended and happy with the winning of good over evil.",1
556,10.0,"Harry Potter was amazing history in our lives and with this chapter it is ending.I'm so glad that they split that last book into two movies. There's no way they could have told this story effectively in one film. This final Potter movie was both awe inspiring and emotionally draining. It really affected me in a way I've never been affected like in a movie before. I might as well admit it hear and now, this movie hammered on my emotional cords and I got chocked up and on the verge of tears, I was barely able to hold them back, but it didn't sound like the audience was able to, the person next to me was bawling her eyes out. The reason this movie affected me differently was because not only did a just get chocked up, but I was on the verge of breaking down through about 85% of the freaking' movie, which is ridiculous! I've never experienced that before. I wanted to cry through the whole movie!As a lifelong fan of the series, watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is what I imagine it would be like watching your kids graduate from high school: your heart swells, your eyes get a little misty, but more than anything else, you're left feeling satisfied in the presence of a huge milestone.",1
557,9.0,Is it perfect? Probably not. But it was a good end to a decade's run of movies.,1
558,8.0,"I didn't particularly like DH Part 1 (see my review), but I DID like Part 2! All Hell breaks loose as He Who Must Not Be Named and his legions fall on Hogwarts in an attempt to destroy Harry Potter. It is all out War! There is a very high body count....",0
559,9.0,"This was a very good, beautifully done ending to this story. It's basically a complex war film with wands instead of guns; it carefully tied up the loose ends, still had ground-breaking revelations to the ones who hadn't read the book before it came out and it featured the epilogue. This whole franchise is a journey and it ends in jolly tears.",1
560,9.0,"Ah, the end has arrived. The final chapter of the one of the most beloved and lucrative film franchises in history has come to a close at last. And what style it does this with. The only real weakness I can identify in this film is the fact that there really is no introduction to the characters of any kind. However, I understand this decision completely, because one really must see all seven previous films to care about the characters as much as they should. If one has not seen the prior installments, then one will not like this movie as much as they should. Oh, well. Their loss. There are a few reasons why this film is the best of the series. The directing style is probably the biggest change, with many artfully-placed shots highlighting exactly what needs to be at any given time. This is one of the last movies I expected to give a serious compliment to the director for, but I have been forced to eat my words. The art style is the next. It is in complete and utter service to the story, as it is almost ceaselessly bleak and dark. Major characters die on both sides. Evil triumphs for a spell (pardon the pun). War has arrived in the wizarding world. The final reason is the acting, which is easily the best of the series. Each actor and actress seems to have realized that they would never be revisiting these parts, so felt that they had to go out with a bang. And what a noise they made! All of these elements by themselves are not what makes this film so great. None of these aspects individually are anything truly spectacular. However, the fact that all three are so consistent in terms of quality throughout the entire thing make this film a noteworthy one. While there are no standout scenes like the one in Part 1 with our trio being chased through the woods by Death Eaters, this actually speaks as to the overall quality of the final product. The reason there are no outstanding scenes is because there are never any falterings, and dips in terms of the elegance or substance of the filmmaking. The overall tone of the film is another differentiating factor, and is one of the things that most people won't even really notice until the movie is over, that there is virtually no comic relief anywhere in the film. Instead, there is an almost relentless onrush of battle scenes which are so well done that they are worth the price of admission alone. Seeing the movie, it is obvious how much the cast and crew cared about this series, through all its ups and downs over the decade of the franchise's existence. It is thanks to this obvious dedication and commitment that truly makes this film and landmark title. Not in terms of cinema by any means, but in modern culture. Only a handful of other films are ones I can say the same for. And if you check my other reviews, they really aren't that hard to spot.",1
561,10.0,Loses two stars for starting the split-up final film bandwagon. JK. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a haunting and beautiful wrapup to the series.,1
562,,"I feel that the directer of the Harry Potter Movies could have done the books and plot of the stories so much better justice. It is great that the main characters were explained but for a fan of the books like myself I had issues with the lack of build up on the supporting characters, such as Neville, Luna, Nymphadora Tonks,and Remus Lupin, to name a few, who I thought where important to the storyline and they are my favorite characters in the series. I was appalled to find that the relationship between Tonks and Lupin was only hinted at in the movies because their relationship, marriage and the birth of their son Teddy was huge in the books because Harry was named Teddy's God father and I thought that was pretty important. Luna and Neville where supposed to have been in the epilogue showing the unique and amazing wizards they had become since they helped Harry defeat ""You Know Who."" I felt that with a little more effort on the directors part, more of the actual story could have been included in the movie.",1
563,9.0,And this movie hits completely different. I do remember watching this movie when I was 20 years old and I just didn't get some of the scenes back in the day. Good writing as a movie and now I'm glad they decided to do the last book as two movies. There's so much here and for me it's been even longer than 12 years since I read Deathly Hallows as book. It was shortly after the book was translated and released. Loved the book can't compare it because I simply don't remember it anymore.,1
564,,"this is no doubt the greatest potter movie ever. the others were phenomenal but this movie had something new. this is also the shortest harry potter movie, 2hrs 10min long. we all wished is could of went on 10 or 15 minutes longer but it was still an excellent movie. this movie is about harry, Ron, and Hermione searching for the remaining horcruxes. Severus snape has taken over hogwarts secretly trying to protect the students from the death eaters while staying undercover as a death eater. and you will find where his true allegiance lies in the film. all the teachers are back also. Remus, mcgonagall, slughorn, flitwick, all of them. and of course harry and voldemort has a duel that is the battle we have all been waiting for. this is a movie we have been waiting ten years to see. it feels like this is the last film also. what i also noticed was Ron and Hermione play a more supporting role in this film than they did in the previous movies. this movie made your emotional go crazy. it made you cry, made you laugh. your on the edge of your seat waiting for what other surprise is coming.i had wished though that the characters that did die, i wish they had shown how they died. the performance that really caught my eye was Alan rickmans performance as Severus snape. he really brings something new to snape that you didn't see in the other films. you see a different side of snape that you haven't seen before. snape being my favorite character, i was very pleased of how his story played out and how he was in the movie. without a doubt see this movie. if your a harry potter fan you will not be disappointed.",1

566,6.0,Since david Yates took over the franachise it went downhill fast .,1
567,10.0,"Deathly Hallows Part-2 has achieved something which no other Fantasy film has achieved, its definitely a fantasy but a very realistic fantasy.Every single ounce of agony and pain is real. From the start till the end its a roller-coaster ride, with no pregnant pauses in between. one of the many plus points of the film is that the battle never over shadows the main tale, and David Yates shows his expertise by dealing with two three story tracks going on at the same time as the main battle progresses in the background. As earth-shattering discoveries are made, the past is questioned and true loyalties are revealed,love still manages to blossom even in times of such darkness, thus giving out a strong message that LOVE indeed is universal.",1
568,10.0,"I just wanted to say they've done a perfectly good job at closing everything out.

570,,"The time is 3:00am and I have just returned from a midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II. With the final Harry Potter film and the release of Toy Story 3 this year, I have suddenly become aware how brief childhood is, and how rapidly the last 10 years have played out. Being born in the early 90s had it's benefits, one of which being that I grew up on Harry Potter. My parents would read the books to me as a child, and had it not been for Rowling I probably would not be reading novels today. Harry Potter first came to our screens in 2001 and we saw for the first time, Daniel, Rupert and Emma in their roles. As the books grew darker, the films grew darker, as the characters grew older and developed so did Radcliffe and friends, as did so many people my age. We all followed Potter on his adventures as we had adventures of our own. However, needles to say the Potter saga is over both on paper and screen and this has left a hole in my heart. I have to say, I have never been more excited for a film in which I already know what is going to happen. However, I have also never been so nervous about a film I am about to see. Would it deliver? Would it live up the books and our expectations? I found myself praying that this would not go the same way as ""The Goblet of Fire"" (a particularly sore spot of mine). The clock stuck midnight in a small but packed cinema and as they announced that they would skip all the trailers the entire audience roared with excitement and sheer happiness. The film started as it should, where we left off in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Did the film deliver? Yes it did. The pace of the film was relentless, but gentle enough when it needed to be. Potter literally had the audience in the palm of it's hand, making us laugh during scenes of death and destruction and weep during scenes of happiness. In the films previous to ""Hallows: Part 2"" I have found myself frowning and cringing at some questionable acting from the cast. I don't like to poke at talented people but I honestly felt Radcliffe in The Goblet of Fire and the Half Blood Prince did not achieve his potential, and for me was not Harry Potter. However it all changed... Daniel Radcliffe gave the absolute performance of his career and was utterly enchanting to watch. A real pleasure to have on our screens. Not only Radcliffe, but the entire cast gave it their absolute all and it showed. A few personal favourites were Alan Rickman as Snape, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Helen McCrory as Mother Malfoy and the brilliant Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. There was not a single flaw in the performance given by anyone and it really makes me proud to be a fan of Harry Potter. As for the 3D? It certainly added to the film but did not distract you from what was actually going on. It was subtle, and beautiful and not at all in-your-face. *cough* Avatar *cough* I've been to see many films at the cinema but have never had such a wonderful, meaningful, emotional and exciting experience other than watching the final Potter film. I kind of don't want to take off my Gryffindor uniform! Potter part 2 left me feeling mesmerised, satisfied and ecstatic but also extremely sad. It also rewarded long-term Potter fans with many references and moments of nostalgia. This film certainly has it's place in history, and I think all would agree it deserves it.",0
571,,"""Harry Potter"" has become more than a magical book and film series showing us that magic does exist making the unbelievable believable. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"" marks the end of an era impeccably concluding the franchise synonymous with our generation's youth. Director David Yates (""Harry Potter 5-7"") brings the series full circle perpetuating an emotional connection within the heart of the viewer that is nothing short of spectacular. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are the fantasy heroes of our day leading the fight against Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, ""The Hurtlocker"") As the harsh realities of life set in with the death of Dobby the free elf and evil growing, the war is in full swing. Harry, Ron and Hermione are regrouping at a small cottage planning their next move. Before the final test between good and evil is unleashed Harry has some final business to finish with Voldemort's last Horcruxes.As their quest takes them to Gringotts Bank and the town of Hogsmeade everyone's favorite characters from the series are preparing for the last stand set to take place where it all began; Hogwarts. The problem is the school is in the hands of Voldemort with Severus Snape (Alan Rickman, ""Dogma"") head master. The journey comes to a close in an epic battle worthy of remembrance accompanied by the relinquishment of the tale's secrets. The dead live on as Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, ""The King's Speech"") guides Harry within conveying that nobody ever dies in vein.",1
572,6.0,"I've watched the movie in a 3D version. During the movie I noticed that quite often you see a sort of Schiller like theater setting in layers appearing on the screen. First layer is sharp, other layers are often not sharp. In photography terms we call this the depth of field. I actually haven't given 3D a lot of thought since it came available, but seeing The Deathly Hallows I realized that when you watch a 3d movie, you want a high level of dept of field. In that case most layers will be sharp giving you a good 3D experience of the movie like looking through a window. Lot's of detail become visible. As the Deathly Hallows don't often use a high DOF, I can't recommend the 3D version as an extra feature to the movie experience, often it's rather annoying to watch this version compared to the 2D movie.",1

574,6.0,"I will make this short : the most beautiful and ""overwhelming"" scene from the final book - and though the entire saga - that is the memories from Snape with/toward Lilly is literally butchered by David Yates' filming. When you listen to Alexandre Desplat's piece of gem for this sequence and if you read the book first...well... you could have asked for much much much better ! This was meant to be a CLIMAX ! Of course the final sequence at the train station is very moving since it pulls you 10 years backwards when you got into those three funny fellows. But I strongly believe the most accurate sequence has been ruined... I'm very pleased anyway to have entered this saga from the beginning to its end.",1

For example when harry kills voldemort its shown as if he has killed some normal troll. The movie lacks dialogues, bad screenplay, it all ends very abruptly. In the start the movie is very little fun to watch, well the most boring part was when Harry talks to Dumbledore. only girls will be crying in this movie. Its not for boys at all not even for geeks.

579,10.0,"This may just be the most true review I have ever written. And the most geeky praise review I have ever written. I truly have never come out of a movie with a feeling quite like leaving Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Pt. 2. Magical some have called it. Amazing others have labeled it. Personally, It was perfect. Don't take the confusion as a bad thing. Deathly Hallows is bloody brilliant. ",1

I personally have not been in touch with Harry Potter in the past and I regret now because I realized that I lost among the best fantasy franchises created, the world being so huge and very interesting. So for the last movie I had high expectations and got what I wanted. There is a lot more action, everything moves much faster and the final battle between good and evil is incredible and the end itself is a pleasant conclusion of all the movies. They even kept the best in the end!",1
583,10.0,"Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?",1
584,,"I saw the first and second Harry Potter movies but then I gave them up as they were all alike with poor acting by the three kids. The trained actors were, as always superb. So, after 10 years I thought I'd give them another chance and went to see the latest release which is currently showing in Bangkok on an enormous IMAX/3D screen. I'm sorry, it did not help, still no acting from the three main characters, most of the time they were standing in a group of three looking at something in the distance. Let,s face it, it,s all about the special effects! Without them this movie would not even get a rating and I doubt we'll see any of the three in any future movies but there again, they probably don't have to act any more.",0
585,8.0,"Harry Potter, the boy who lived! Every child will know, and remember that name. The worldwide phenomenon has, I regret to say, indeed finished. How did it end? Magnificently. The idea of splitting the seventh part of the book was a brilliant economic trick (prolonging the flow of money given by the franchise). The first part gave a slow-paced introduction to the grand finale of the second movie. But, not without it's negative aspects. The tension that builds up to the end of the first part and continues from the very beginning of the second part dies somewhere at the middle of the second movie! It lasts for two hours, and somewhere at the end of the first hour the movie starts to slow down to a rate that is just not adequate to the first half. With a lot of tension and suspense, the movie does quite a bad job holding on to it. I must say that this is the very best HP screen adaptation in the franchise, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that it was just 5-10 brilliant sequences (e.c. the death of Snape) combined with not so great connection sequences (e.c. the constant interruption of battle with monologues). Also, the movie lacks characters! I had a feeling that Ron and Hermione had a lot less screen time than Nagini. Characters like prof. McGonagall, Hagrid, prof. Slughorn... had an embarrassingly small amount of screen time. Yes, the idea of the movie is the battle between Harry and Voldmort (who is the best-played character in the film) but that does not give the right to literally push out everyone else out of the picture. Do not be misled by these small complaints, the movie is brilliant. The most positive aspect of the movie are emotions! The death of Snape and the talk Harry has with his deceased friends and family is just heart-breaking and made the whole theater cry (myself included). Death is the main theme of this film from the very beginning, and the dark tone in the music and environment fits perfectly with it (sometimes I wondered if this is a film for children). Harry Potter gave us quite a ride through the years, and it ended just as it had started: magically! 8/10",1

This is not my favorite movie of the saga, because I've always been more interested in episodes with a more jovial character that I found in the first four movies.

The final battle was disappointing, but I felt that way when I read the book years ago.

The music,cinematography everything was just...perfect! This movie,was the best in the series. Prince's tale was portrayed so beautifully,it's hard not to cry during this scene(I don't wanna spoil anything).The cast gave their best,especially,Alan Rickman. They DID go out with a bang.

592,7.0,Harry potter and the deathly hollows part 2! a good but disappointing film in my eyes. note i never read the books. so my complains in this review will be nothing based upon that. first the good. good 1 the film picks up where the other left off. 2 Voldermort is in a lot of scenes. 3 snape has emotion. 4 a lot of people die! 5 some great Battles. the bad. 1 everything was two rushed. 2 snape memory's went by way too quickly. 3 there was not connection between any of the characters. 4 two much action. 5 Voldermorts death was ridiculous! Bellatrix even more so! they died way two easily! 6 two many off screen deaths. 7 Harry not dieing after being shot with the death curse was completely ridiculous! it completely ruined the tension i was feeling after i thought he was no more. 8 if harry had to come back it should have at least appeared he was dead until the very last second before he fought you know who. in stead the audience already new he was alive almost right after he had been shot. 9 harry has kids with jenny. corny ending! again still a enjoyable film. but i expected something better for a finale!,0
593,10.0,"Ten years ago Harry Potter began and now, ten years later, it ends with a beauty and majesty that is unmatched by any other film in the series. Here is where everyone went all out, both in performance as well as artistic wise. Our beloved three main actors; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, put on on the performances of their careers in this final Harry Potter. They unleash an emotional side of themselves that we haven't seen before in their movies while also showing the strength of their characters unlike we've ever seen in any other Harry Potter. However, alas, it is still nearly impossible for any actor in the movie to stand by the imposing figure of the scared and angry Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) as well as the intimidating and secretive Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); who also has an almost Darth Vaderish feel about him in this movie, and not be out-shined. Either way, besides the outstanding performances, the special effects team worked the most amazing kind of magic for the climatic final battle of Hogwarts. The posters show that Hogwarts is in ruin but seeing how it got there just sets an almost tearful mood for decade long fans (and even non-fans shall be tempted to shed a tear for the painful sight). The technical aspects of the film will blow anyone as much as the performances will. Altogether it will cause your eyes to blaze with the power from this film.",1
594,10.0,"I have nothing to say but astounding.Ultimately the best Harry Potter film of all time.I must say that it truly was an excellent performance by Danielle Radcliffe,Matthew Lewis,Ralph Fiennes,Maggie Smith,and of course the whole movie has to go to Alan Rickman.The movie was very intense and was a good ending for the Harry Potter Franchise,and i hope that if J.K. Rowling ever writes another book (will probably be about Harry,Ron,and Hermione's kids going to Hogwarts)then Chris Columbus(director of the first two Potter movies)should step up again to direct.Then will the franchise be finally finished.But I cannot stop thinking about ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone"" compared to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2"".Because everyone in the film has grown so much and,to cut a long storie short I would like to say a thanks to J.K. Rowling,Danielle Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Chris Columbus,David Yates,and all the other directors of course,Oliver and James Phelps,Bonnie Wright,Alan Rickman,Maggie Smith,Michael Gambon,Richard Harris,Tom Felton,Matthew Lewis,Imelda Staunton,Robbie Coltrane,Ralph Fiennes,Helena Bonham Carter,Gary Oldman,David Thewlis,Jason Issacs,Evanna Lynch,and everybody else in the cast or crew.Thank you Harry Potter!",1

The deaths of major characters were just glossed over in about 30 seconds.

However, the final duel with V was a letdown because there was no crowd of hopeful- fearful watchers all around, differing from the book. Not even Ron and Hermione witnessed the death duel. So that felt weak, lackluster. The movie also left out the post-battle scene in Dumbledore's office. Bummer. The epilogue at train station was okay, but for me the acting was too serious and staid, not enough joy and merriment.",0
606,6.0,Like all the anticipated Harry Potter fans I have been waiting to watch this movie. And while doing that i read all the books again and the book 7 twice - and that was the mistake i committed! Because when I saw the movie i could not help but compare the movie with book and I have to say this - it was not what I had visualized. ,0
607,10.0,"All of the Harry Potter films have been phenomenal, but this one stands out. Part 1 has been noted to lack action, but Part 2 is a masterpiece! Everyone knows the story, Harry, Ron and Hermione are hunting for the last Horcruxes, which are Voldemort's secret to immortality, and everything ends with the final, epic battle between Harry and Voldemort. The film follows the book brilliantly, but I have to admit the beginning felt a little rushed. Many fans, including myself, expressed disappointment in the fact that many scenes are missing, such as Dumbledore's back story and Fred Weasley's death, which makes many parts of the film confusing for people who haven't read the books, but nevertheless, Harry Potter goes out with a bang. I loved the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, which doesn't happen in the book, and was completely action packed and utterly brilliant. Ron and Hermione's kiss was long awaited and doesn't disappoint, although keeping it the same as in the book would probably have been better. The scene in the Great Hall where Harry, Ron and Hermione mourn Fred, Lupin and Tonk's deaths is extremely emotional, but as I said, showing Fred's death would have been better, partcially as those who haven't read the book may be confused as to which Weasley died. His death in the book is such a powerful moment between the Weasley's, mainly Percy, who in past films abandoned his family, and the whole moment just brings them all together. The scene still brought tears to my eyes as both Fred and George are my favourite HP characters. Another of my favourite scenes is when Harry has the Resurrection Stone and is reunited with his parents, Sirius and Lupin. Although I have to say, the best moment in the entire film was Snape's memories. Alan Rickman seriously deserves an Oscar for his performance! The scene really pulls things together, revealing Snape's past and many other things. Oh, and the epilogue scene was very good. Personally, I would have liked it to be longer and feature more of the moments in the book, such as formal introductions to Harry and Ginny's and Ron and Hermione's children. I would have also have loved to see Teddy Lupin, who I was looking forward to seeing, as well as James running up to his family and shouting out that Teddy and Victoire were kissing. When Harry hugged his youngest son, Albus I cried a little inside. Arthur Bowen is the perfect choice for Albus Potter, and I adore the scene between them. That ending makes me wish that JK Rowling writes another HP book, this time about Albus's first year at Hogwarts. The epilogue is another of my favourite scenes, and I love the fact that they kept the original music from the Philosopher's Stone as well. When watching that scene I held onto my friend and we both cried. Overall, the best possible way to end the Harry Potter films. That was an incredible decade and will never be forgotten. Thank you JK for sharing this with the world! xx",1

609,7.0,"Everyone returns, including the brother and dead sister of the beloved Professor Dumbledore, who live in an oil painting, and even the ghost of Dumbledore himself, played once again by Michael Gambon. Hogwarts is now in the malevolent hands of the sinister Severus Snape (hissing, sniveling Alan Rickman), who is holding students and staff hostage as they wait for Harry to rescue them. The walls and platforms that hold up Hogwarts crumble and collapse like Tinker Toys in a masterpiece of destruction, turning the school of magic into the world's most colossal rubbish heap. A humongous man-eating snake with fangs that strike the audience in 3-D almost devours Hermione, while Ron narrowly escapes a cauldron of flames on a broomstick. With Hogwarts gone and almost every member of the cast killed off by Voldemort, there could obviously never be another installment. But there's still time for tender-hearted Professor Minerva McGonagell (Maggie Smith) to save the day with a spell she's been waiting for years to try. There is even a flashback that explains the sinister role Snape played in Harry's life story that I found unexpectedly touching. The only thing left to do to bring this saga to a heart-stopping conclusion is for Harry to enter the forbidden forest of death like a true hero and face his destiny with Voldemort, played one last time by the hatchet-faced Ralph Fiennes, who actually shows his human side for the first time. Frankly, I'm sorry to see him go.",1

613,8.0,"Harry and his friends make their way back to Hogwarts for a final confrontation. By this point it's clear that this is no longer a children's fantasy story. The stakes are kept high by a sizable body count and heavy themes such as self-sacrifice. The film is anchored by Harry's weighty realization that he is a horcrux and that he must die. J.K. Rowling's clever final plot turns remain intact, including a moving trip through Snape's memories. Slight changes – such as having Harry and Voldemort confront each other away from everyone else – render the climax a bit less memorable than it might've been. Also, Harry's relationship to Ginny feels rather perfunctory, having barely been established in the previous films.",1

I follow IMDb .. been following it for the last two or three years if a movie is rated 7-8 or above i would run to theater or buy a DVD but fans giving movies like this 9 or 10 disappoints me a lot.i suggest watch the movie only if u love harry series other then that prefer captain America or horrible bosses or Transfomers 3",1
615,10.0,"I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time, so I really surprised to find out that the final Harry Potter film ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the best of the eight films since the first four films. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", I thought that David Yates was making the story a bit dull, but it was still a good adaptation. In ""Half-Blood Prince"", Yates made the story better and leaner and funnier than ever and he became a rather ordinary to an extraordinary filmmaker. In the first half of the ""Deathly Hallows"", he succeeded again only to bring in a lot of the rising danger that our three heroes had to face and he did that with the help of composer Alexandre Desplat. Now in ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Yates has become a full-fledged director who knows how to pull all the right stops and he, like screenplay writer Steve Kloves (who didn't adapt the 5th book in J.K. Rowling's series), manages to stay true to Rowling's books by bringing us to the edges of darkness. In the end of ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) possessed the Elder Wand from the dead Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and in the beginning of ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) has finally reached the breaking points in their friendship. They are still in search of the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) and it is bringing them back to the place when they were taught how to do magic: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It's now owned by the Death Eaters and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), the magic has crumbled and the dementors are keeping a lookout for the trio. A lot of our favorite characters are back and some get some huge screen time including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis, even stronger than ""Order of the Phoenix"") and Professor McGonagall (the ferocious Maggie Smith). The Battle of Hogwarts itself is very shocking and very scary. Lives are lost, one has to make a sacrifice and there are a few people who are willing to survive and to live another day. I am seriously not spoiling anything here. But we do get to know the back story of Snape and the long-awaited battle of Voldemort and Harry. Yes, there are also a few fan moments that we have expecting to see, especially a battle between Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter) and the incredibly emotional finale set 19 years later. (I won't explain the rest). At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the shortest of the series and it manages to still stay true to the second half of the book. It is devastating, funny, sharply written and brilliant at its very best. I'll give you a warning though for those entering in: It's extremely violent for a PG-13 and then again, it's perfectly safe. I loved the books and I've admired the films for over 10 years now and it's great to see how Radcliffe, Grint and Watson grown from young up-and-coming actors to real grown-up actors now. It's very remarkable. P.S: I went to go see it in 2D instead of 3D, but then again, it's your choice. This is, not only the best of the series or the best summer film of the year, but it is the best film I've seen in 2011. Period. It's the best finale yet and, yes, I am comparing them to the finales of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"". They were epic in every way and now this one is an epic that stays on its own. I advise you see it, for Harry Potter fans only.",1

Its stunning visually and the effects are commendable. One more thing is that you will find your heart pacing as more and more time passes. Definitely all you think is that its gonna end now. I watched in 3d and didn't find much use of 3d except 2-3 good scenes. So its moreover kind of same if you watch in 2d. The truths when unfold delivers a shock to us.

It's been 10 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first movie in the epic, was released. In those 10 years, we've watched Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Matthew Lewis and Tom Felton, grow from children into young adults. After his unfortunate passing the late Richard Harris, who played Professor Dumbledore in the first two films, was replaced by Michael Gambon, who stepped in and built upon the wonderful work done by his predecessor. Alan Rickman, previously most notable for portraying Hans Gruber in Die Hard, gives his most endearing performance as Professor Severus Snape; and Matthew Lewis' does a fantastic job of giving a top-notch portrayal of a mature and no longer reserved Neville Longbottom. Over the years we were amazed while watching characters we'd read about be brought to life on the big screen; we allowed ourselves to develop relationships with the characters as they themselves developed relationships; we cried, as character we grew to care about sacrificed themselves to help protect our young hero to be; we laughed as the Dursleys got their comeuppance for their terrible mistreating of Harry; and we watched anxiously, awaiting the inevitable showdown with Voldemort. Very much in the same way that thanks to Star Wars, Mark Hamil will always be known as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher will always be known as Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford will always be known as Hans Solo; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint will always be known as Harry, Hermione and Ron.",1

The creator of this great epic phenomenon, gave us what we had foresaw – Harry Potter was and is and will always be a part of our lives. For you see, it was at the hand of a young writer by the name J.K. Rowling that gave us something to live for.",1

In fact it could be the best end of all movies. This movie was a huge success with great special effects and story! It is filled with action and great suspense. The end is the best!! And all you book fans it is very true to the book! It exceeded all my expectations!!! Although it's the end and I will miss Harry Potter, I left the cinema with a happy face!!!

629,7.0,"The last Harry Potter movie was actually a sad event. It was extremely sad for everyone who cares so much about the books and the movies. Everybody knew it was the end of an era. And you watch that movie with that idea in mind, even after watching it 4 times in cinema. There were so many scenes in this movie who were beautifully filmed. Perfectly. and had some drama in it. This was Alan Rickman's movie. His performance was absolutely outstanding. This movie had so much in it, that it is almost impossible to don't like it. During the whole movie there is actually this long waited confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. It is excited that it is not one battle and then it is overno, there are some fights and duels during the whole movie. And between those scenes there are moments of romance and moments of sadness-extreme sadness , which breaks the hard of the fans. I can only say that I am proud on the way they end this amazing film series. ",1

Final installment of this series was so waited and anticipated and it does not disappoint. One of the best movies so far.It can't be any good Harry Potter finally came to satisfying conclusion. I know it's somewhat disappointing for the franchise book lovers but it's best movie in the movie series. i loved how it ended and left a moral and great mark on all of our mind .

631,8.0,"J.K. Rowling must be a woman of overriding emotions. Beginning by scribbling in those coffee shops paid off into blockbuster magic. Harry Potter's final instalment is a fitting tribute to J.K's beautiful, eccentric imagination, pursuing the world of magic in a tone that replicates every living soul's beliefs of wizardry. The tone of the magic becoming dark and disconcerting was foreseeable as legend has it that there are those who experiment beyond a devilish level. Those desirable Potter fans that have travelled throughout the world of Hogwarts, having been given an illustrated ending full of emotion and power that encourage those devotees to support Harry and his compatriots on their route towards Voldermort's destruction.",1
632,4.0,"It is a truly sad reflection on the film industry that, with the commercial success of this film practically guaranteed, HP8 was not far better; especially with amount of CGI thrown at it. If you have read the book, then, most likely, you will find HP8 a rather pedestrian stroll through the main scenes, nothing more. Where there are changes, these detract from the book and some are positively dreadful! Potter fans beware. As for the final scenes with HP versus Voldemort, what an awful distortion of the book. I am astonished that JKR allowed such a travesty. The exploding bodies and snake were laughable. A scene that more closely followed the book would have really lifted the film but I guess the people behind the camera realised (if they had not had this horrible realisation ages ago) that Radcliffe simply could not have pulled it off. It is such a pity he was chosen the role he is far too wooden. That said, Radcliffe does perform slightly better in this one though, sadly that is saying very little. The final scene – 19 years later – should be cut, it was pathetic. I watched the 3D version and it added nothing so save your money and go and see the 2D one. The stand out performer of the series is Alan Rickman. It is a pity that Richard Harris died he was a far superior Dumbledore. I have given the film a very kind rating of 5.",0
633,10.0,"This was such a great ending to Harry Potter, it went out in such great style. Like a lot of the other Harry Potter movies, every scene is either great or brilliant. This movie had almost the same level of surprises as Prisoner of Azkaban did, but the action was better in Deathly Hallows 2 and it also had more dramatic scenes (like the resurrection stone scene, Voldemort's final defeat etc) than Prisoner of Azkaban. My only minor criticism is I think the movie was a tad too focused on action, some more dialogue between Harry and his dead parents would've been lovely. Deathly Hallows Part II is the 6th best movie of all time in my opinion.",1
634,,"Harry Potter, a series of novels that defied everything that was possible and started a phenomenon unlike anything that ever existed or ever will exist. An entire generation has come to identify themselves with the books and the movies, especially those who shared a similar age with the characters when they came out. Last night, when I saw the eighth and final Harry Potter movie at the midnight screening, I was yelling and cheering when the curtain came open and once again yelling and cheering when the credits started to roll. But I had tears in my eyes, both of joy and immense sadness that it was now over, as one of the greatest film series of all time comes to an end.",1

636,,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II is a great conclusion to the enormous success of the Harry Potter film series that has great visual effects and powerful acting. It's a satisfying conclusion to the biggest movie franchise to come out over the past 10 years. The acting is very good particularly from actors like Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who has the best speech since Aragorn's speech in the Lord of the Rings The Return of the King. My main complaints with the movie was that some characters like Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix and Julie Walter's Mrs Weasley are very underused and the 3D makes the movie a whole lot darker and by the end of the movie I had a head ache. So in my opinion stick to the 2D version as when I took my glasses off the movie looked a lot brighter. So overall this movie is a good conclusion to a fantastic film series but stick to the 2D version if you can find it.",1

This movie is simply epic, and while the spaces for the most part are confined, it is on a grand scale. Unlike the last movie, by like all the others previous, most of the action takes place at Hogwarts, which for some reason they changed the architecture to. I don't get why they did that, but the sets are still amazing, especially Gringotts, which was much darker this time, the sequence on the bridge, which I thought was a good addition, and all of the destroyed courtyards.

639,5.0,"While I can't give an F because it's still a well made movie, there is so much I hate about this. I've read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows nine times. This does the book no justice. There's a ridiculous amount of effects that don't belong in the movie, discontinuity and missed potential. They seriously traded in an epic battle in the great hall for Voldemort slapping Harry. I wrote down a list last time watching and was able to find over a hundred legitimate problems I had with the movie. Worst of all is this movie had no depth. The book has beautiful themes of love that are entirely absent from this movie. This is even more bothering when you go back to the first three movies which touch on this theme so not only is it ignoring the book, but also the precious movies. In the first, Dumbledore has a moving speech about the scar love leaves and in the book Harry sacrifices himself with this intention. The movie wastes this potential with a corny scene that has no impact on the themes and characters. The entire movie is loaded with these types of ridiculous changes. It doesn't deserve half the love it gets.",0

The movie kicks off right where Part 1 ended and there is an intense atmosphere from the very beginning as Harry and his friends know what must happen. There are lots of emotions running throughout this movie as an avid fan would feel for each character as the story unfolds. The effects are great! The 3D didn't really add much however it didn't take anything away either. The music and sound is superb as usual. The script was well written and the acting was great. When you grow up loving Harry Potter, this is the kind of ending you expect to see and I must say David Yates did a phenomenal job! Its intense, it emotional and it sure is thrilling which makes this movie the Perfect Ending.",1
642,8.0,"The last film in the Harry Potter Movie , starts right were the other one ended, in the middle of a story. The beginning of the movie is the weakest section of the movie, it starts with hard to follow exposition that probably weakens all the movies in the series after the first two. Though of all the movie this one is not to long, like most of them. It only gets better and more exciting as time goes on. It also is conclusive.<br /><br />The first time I watched these movies I had a hard time following the plot and never understood Why Snape kills Dumboledore, but this time I get it. The second time around I finally got to appreciate the plot and details.<br /><br />This is the most exciting movie in the series, and the Harry, Hermione, and Ron all get their moments to shine, but even Mcgonogal and Nevile get their moments to shine. (And it is awesome). Ron and Hermione finally get together after 8 movies and I it so happy. Some of the side characters' deaths are just glossed over and don't land.<br /><br />I don't have much to say about this movie. I love the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. When all the horecruxes are destroyed it is awesome.<br /><br />I don't really understand Snape's character I can't tell if you are supposed to like him because Lilly (Harry's Mom) is his only motivation. If that is thing stopping him from being evil I am not sure I like him.<br /><br />This movie is the conclusion and it wraps up the story of all 8 movies great and is and awesome, heroic ending that makes you feel good.

All I can say is I'm sure they will have missed loads of the original story out but unless you are aware of whats missing the film as a whole is great. In the defence for the Director and Producers I would imagine there was just far too much to cram in to the film and some of it possibly wouldn't have translated well on to screen so this has to be forgiven. Doesn't it? Any way I have loved all the films from year 1 to year 7 and it was nice to have David Yates back to direct this one. He stuck to his guns and this second instalment carries on with the same feel as the previous few he made. I found the first films all felt slightly different and disjointed, with each director, quite rightly, putting their own spin on them however with David at the helm there is more consistency here.",0

I loved the climatic landscapes of this movie and the way the story comes alive and makes the magic seem real. It was with bittersweet sadness that I enjoyed watching this movie knowing that there are no more stories coming. Oddly, I did not feel this way when reading the books.

649,,"from the very beginning of the movie, harry potter loses its iconic sense of magic to be replaced by a feeling of utter content. although it is good to feel content i was strongly expecting a movie with significantly more bang to it. the whole movie consists of one continuous fast moving story line that is overly obsessed with stuffing as much content as possible instead of showing the more emotional side of the story.

650,8.0,"As big Harry Potter fan I was pretty satisfied with this movie. Some of the few issues I do have with it is it could have been a little more faithful to the book, and I wish it could have been a bit longer as well and there was more focus on characters like Fred, Lupin and all the characters who died. However the movie knocks all the key moments from the book out of the park, Snape's revelation, Harry's death, the ending etc were all really well done. The main leads also give their best performance so far in this one.",1

When the WB logo came on and the music swelled, I felt like my kid was graduating High School Valedictorian/Captain of the Football Team! Pooh-Pooh on the nasty Dursleys and the greedy banker Goblins (perfect political and economic timing on those fronts). Hermione got her hero moment and her man. Ron's Mom got to kick ass and the theater raised the roof on her invective to Bellatrix! Dumbledore was heavenly. And Snape, Severus Snape, undoubtedly one of cinemas all-time character roller-coaster rides. Is he? Isn't he. He did? He didn't! I really felt for this guy, and that he is Lily's soul-mate is beyond touching. It would have been nice to have had sentimental wraps for more characters like Hagrid, Buckbeak, even Draco, but HP7II is not about being sappy. I felt completely engaged, fulfilled, and even a bit exhausted after this excellent film. This experience has deep lessons to offer, and I'm on my way to check it out again now. Undoubtedly I will see this movie more in it's first-run theater showing, than any other film. Lifetime achievement Oscars for the whole lot, I say! Mischief Managed!",1
652,10.0,"While I'm sure Alexandre Desplat is a competent composer, the series ends with the image underscored by themes composed by John Williams, not Desplat, whose major contribution to this film consisted of loud contrapuntal music that underscored the fight scenes. However, the music we love, the music we remember are the themes Williams employs with ever film he scores, giving characters unique music cues that help the audience identify with them when they appear. We wouldn't feel about Potter the way we do without those themes, as his contributions to cinema are vastly underrated and underappreciated. John Williams is the greatest film composer of all time for a reason. He's just brilliant. He can take any piece of cinema and turn it into one of thrilling amazement without the viewer understanding that it is music that brings the visceral connection most people subconsciously identify. Williams scores make movies great and memorable. Where would Indiana Jones, Superman, ET, and Luke Skywalker be without John Williams giving us a cue that help us ""feel"" the way we do about them. So to give Williams a tiny credit at the end of this movie is a disservice to the composer. The final shot of the movie is one that makes us laugh, makes us cry, gives us emotional connection because it is John Williams music that underscores the final shot.",1

CGI done perfect, so much so, that the membranes of the dragon's wings fluttered in the wind, wow! Only thing that I wish is that they should have released the film as ONE complete whole (Part 1 and 2 together). I hope that they will release it in Blu-ray as one complete film. Yes, to make more money split it in two, but for the purists no parts please! The reason? The emotional arc of the movie is lost in the second part that is found in the fist.

678,8.0,"Let me begin this review by saying that I'm a huge Potter Fan, I have all of the books and movies, I've enjoyed them all even if the movies do make changes to the books. But I have to say this film was the closest one to the book, it still made some changes to the material but as far as I'm concerned these changes were not that big, unlike the previous films in the series, fans of the book should enjoy this film as much as the non fans will. The film is quite short, the shortest of the series, running for about two hours and ten minutes.. But this also happens to be the best film in the series, the acting of the main lead actors has improved a lot since the first film which came out ten years ago, out of all three I have to say Daniel Radcliff is the best of the group, he delivers his line in such a perfect way, this is not to say the other two actors are not great, because they are in their own way. But as good as they are, they are no match for Alan Rickman who play's Snape with such an ease, Rickman is truly Snape I cannot picture anyone playing but Rickman, and you'll see why if you go and see this film, his acting has always been great in the films but in this one he really delivers a truly developed character that you feel for, even if you happen to hate Snape. All of the other supporting actors are all great as well, but I had to mention the three main leads and Alan Rickman because they all steal the show, especially Rickman. As far as the story goes, this is the best of them all because the story is much more developed this time around, the stakes are high and you can just feel it. There's so much happening in the movie that you can hardly breath, not that this is a bad thing because it's a wonderful thing, the characters are even more developed this time around and it shows because you start to care for all of them even the characters that don't really matter to the story, they are all developed in their own way. The only problem I have with the movie is the battle it's a little short but this is only a minor problem and it does not stop the movie from being perfect in my option, I hope you guys enjoyed my review for the film, and I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did, thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.",1

So the path to conquer the darkness is not that easy, so there are multiple twist and turns and stunning, emotional revealations coming to you will talk about that shortly. We returned to Hogwarts and our revolutionary Neville longbottom welcomes and Harry, Hermione and Ron meeting them they all rejoice for a short period of time while voldemort is gearing for attacking Hogwarts and rest you watch the movie and enjoy. Now coming to the movie this one is the best chapter in the franchise hands down, it is the shortest and most action packed film of the series, the stakes are immensely high this time the basic thing while concluding the chapter is to give fan service the convieneint way of setting up an action scene but no this film combines action setpieces and emotionally poignant drama so beautifully that you as an audience,fan will want to end this in a good way but wants to go to the finish line along with Harry and his freinds. The character development of all the primary characters are excellent, especially the portion of Snape the montage of Snape's past is directed so well that you will feel teary eyed. Alexandra desplat's rousing scored elevated the film in such a epic way that you feel why they didn't give the man the honour of the Oscars. It was so nice of him to include nicholar hoopers tragic melodious farewell of Dumbledore to the fantastic montage of snape. This is the way the whole movie comes full circle we started with the journey and while ending we need the past adventures, trauma to complete it. Eduardo serra's cinematography is grimy, gritty and melancholic at the same time,there is an element of dremyness in his lenses even if it is dark and gloomy for the most part the sense of magic never goes away. The special effects are astonishing. Every technical aspects United to make this film a great conclusion. Coming to the actors Daniel Radcliffe does all the heavy lifting of becoming a leader and also the part of a tortured soul brilliantly, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint all these are now legitimate great actors. Alan rickman's last hurrah is one of his best performance in the series and even the best in his filmography! All the other British thespians gave there all to this film. There are prominent characters who didn't get enough time to so there talents thats understandable cause there is so much going on in the film. But David Yates staged the scenes of these characters so well it makes us feel no! Every character has there own arc. Stuart Craig's production design is again top notch and Steve kloves screenplay is pitch perfect. And yeah Neville longbottom is super heroic the actor really shines in this movie. Is it an epic film no! It is an epic grounded fantasy film cause even if it is not real you still care for the characters we all grew up watching them grew up. So at the end this is the best conclusion ever no-one can match this note perfect ending and Jk Rowling because of her we witnessed such a great cinematic experience. And all good things must end.",1

686,,"HP DH P2 gets the same rating as P1 because it too, lacked punch; it needed umph to be interesting and it just wasn't. In fact, I can sum up Pts 1 and 2 in about three words: dull, lifeless and flat! The movie was too slow, and it needed speed or something because for most of it, it felt like you were slogging through muddied molasses. I'll admit that it was interesting to see the trio as adults, but could the finale get any more awkward? And Voldemort's death? Oh please, about as anti-climatic as you can get. He just seemed to turn into ashes and float away! I'm sorry to say this but the last two movies were as Razzie as you can get. Overall, the two parts may have grossed over several billion, but in my book, it wasn't worth the twelve bucks to go see them; viewers should have paid less than half that. At least I - and many others - won't be tortured anymore by any more chopped up crap. If like me, you love the Potter series, for God's sake, stick to the books, they last longer!",0

688,10.0,"A must-see end to the series of the magical Harry Potter world. I recommend it to all ages, all genders and all expectations. This grand finale starts off where part 1 of Deathly Hallows finished, with Harry crouching besides Dobby's grave. It is showing how the good is weak and evil are getting stronger, but Harry, Ron and Hermione are determined to hunt down the remaining horcruxes. After a heart-stopping trip to the bank, the threesome go to Hogwarts for the final battle. Many innocent lives are taken, with some main characters getting killed. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint make an excellent job portraying their life-long characters, and though it's Emma's best film, she still lacks the chirisma from my point of view. The movie ends really well, but I'd have liked more of a bang at the end so the viewer could have been left wondering what was going to happen next.",1
689,8.0,"This was my first preview experience of a movie.My first reaction? Very Good.best among David Yates'. SPOILER ALERT !!!. Well, its fast paced, unlike previous one.The movie starts on a high.(SPOILER)The Gringotts Bank scene,excellently coordinated,pulls you in the movie instantly.All the scenes are absolute visual treat. Few scenes are worth 3D viewing, but most are not.The movie has many scenes already in dark and the 3D glasses make them look even less bright. Watch it in 3D only if you have to,but I would recommend to watch in 2D. Harry, voldemort and severus are deservedly given ample screenspace,but other characters(even important ones)are felt to have only a cameo.Even Nagini has longer role.(SPOILER)The ron-hermione kiss is aptly placed.Severus Snape's character has finally been done justice with!The wand-fight scenes are not as abysmal as in 6th movie but also not the best in the franchise, They craved for some background score! Silence works Yates,but too much use of it takes out its intensity.(SPOILER) It was great to see Molly and McGonagall in action.It intensifies the importance of the whole fight.Couldn't even spot Kingsley,Lupin,Fred-George,Arthur,Tonks . Neville is perfect! Excellent performances by Ralph Fiennes,Dan, Watson and Alan Rickman.",1

The only thing I was disappointed with was how long it took for part 2 to came out after part 1.

I think this was the best Harry Potter movie out of the entire series that made for a near-perfect close. Even though Part 2 did diverge from the ending of the book, the reason its getting the rating I'm giving it is because I do appreciate what everyone working to give us the great stories that came off the books. The books didn't do the movies justice, but I enjoyed watching them and watching Dan Radcliffe portraying Harry going from a once small innocent boy to a slightly grizzled man, and a wonderful one at that. I do appreciate what he did for the series, and in my opinion, he has proved that he was the right guy to play Harry Potter over the last decade. I hope that this movie does get Academy Award recognition because I believe Part 2 truly deserves it! So long Harry, Ron, and Hermione! Its been a long journey, and we'll miss you all! :)",1

702,10.0,"I was at the premiere in Denmark today (the 13th of July) and I simply do not know where to start, probably because I got a lot of thoughts and emotions running through my head and veins right now..At 02.45 am. (Excactly 2 hours and 45 minutes after the first midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows part 2 started.) But let me begin with the size of this saga. From when the first Harry Potter book was released in 1997 (ever since I was a small boy at the age of 4) the Harry Potter-universe has just grown bigger and bigger. The effects have become more and more fascinating and exclusive, the mysteries and riddles have become numerous and besides of that our dear characters (naturally) have become older, smarter and (I can say this because I'm a male)some girls even got real women. And really beautiful ones as well. Now what I am trying to say is that Harry Potter has been a gigantic part of my life. (Not many sagas can say they have lasted for 14 years.) The Harry Potter series has always reflected my life in another world. A magic world. This was the place where I could be when I needed to dream myself away from our world's struggles. And I am not even shy to say that I even have (in my Harry Potter-trance-dreaming) been in love with Hermine Granger (Emma Watson), and realizing the truth wasn't easy for me in that age, so I always felt like I was stuck here in Denmark...I just couldn't get over there..To: London! Now that I am 18 years old, an adult, I know that it has always been a dream. But a very good dream :) So I still (especially now after this last movie) for some reason feel the burning desire to get up in the air and fly above London..And even above every capital city in the world. Because that's how huge the Harry Potter series is. Imagine EVERY SINGLE capital city of the world seen from above in ONE place (and then even at night with all the beautiful lights on.) Then you understand the size of the Harry Potter series when I watch it. (I hope it isn't too difficult to follow me.) So if there is anyone out there who feels kind of the same crazy addiction to the Harry Potter series, then PLEASE respond to me, invite me to your group or whatever you have...Because I really need to share the immortal Harry Potter series with somebody. Especially after this spectacular ending for which I thank the producers, directors, actors, actresses and the entire rest of the crew from all my heart. It really means a lot to me. It always did.",1
703,10.0,"Yeah - everything has to end which often is a bad thing, maybe even terrible. But oh well. From the first Harry Potter I've read(which is Prisoner of Azkaban) I fell in love with the series. Alone with The lord of the ring(hobbit included) it became my favorite story. It just has so much to it. So much spirit, heart and awesomeness. And now the end has come. OK that's enough of me rambling. So the screenplay. I thought it was pretty good, damn even really good. Of cause there are some lines that was much better in the book but the ending is awesome, I can even say that even though it's unlogical it's almost better then in the book(it would of been better if they said everything they said in the book during the fight). The acting is great. I loved leads perfomenses, loved Helena Bonham Carter and even though Alan could of done better than that I loved him too. The special effect's are the best I've seen. The 3D is awesome. It almost - yeah just almost - got that special book atmosphere. All in all it's the best movie about the young wizard and the best ending possible. Goodbye Harry - we were lucky enough to stay with you till the very end.",1

This final installment perfectly ties everything up with just the right amount of gravitas, intensity, and feel-good warmth. This is no longer a film series for kids, it's a film series for people who were kids when they saw the first film, and are now at the precipice of adulthood, just like Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson).

706,6.0,"After seeing the first part that I found boring I thought that Harry Potter part two was better. My rating: 6/10 (not so bad). My opinion about the movie is that it has very good special effects and that it is the only thing I liked the ""most"" in Harry Potter. The special effects are the most used details in Harry Potter movie and they are so excellent, especially the scene where we see the battle of Voldemort against Harry Potter and this is the scene I preferred the most in the film. It was so well done! But it doesn't mean that I found it super good. Not at all. I am not really a fan of Harry film. I never really understood the Harry Potter stories and it is too difficult for me to understand and to make sense with it. Probably because, I never read any of the books. Harry Potter is a very violent film with a lot of bloody scenes. It is too violent sometimes. My sister read some or every Harry books but not me. But I have to admit that some things are good in the film (like the special effects, of course). Harry Potter is a good story. I've seen the entire seven films and I preferred the second and fifth one (I think). It is very hard for me to understand Harry's stories. I saw it at the cinema in 3D and to be honest the 3D glasses didn't give anything special to the screen. It was so boring! I wonder if Harry Potter is a real success in the world. But for me it isn't. There are a lot of sad feelings in the Harry films. It is very sad sometimes. But it is scarry at the same time. I will give only 1 Oscar for Harry Potter film. Good try anyway. My name is Constantin and I am fourteen years old. Goodbye.",1

I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot.

It's prolonged action sequences, with spectacular special effects are the brim-hold of this film, and the emotional scenes are enough to make anyone cry their eyes out for a decade long for seeing these wonderful characters grow into fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe really gives it his all in the last moments of the film, and Alan Rickman's performance will show his sensitive side that WILL make people loose it. It is a Definitely well-crafted film monumental masterpiece, with Oscarworthy performances from the whole cast, Deep and Tragic scores from Alexandre Desplat that sound unlike any movie score I ever heard of, and matching that of John Williams(which his music ""Hedwig's theme"" makes an appearance in this one), and an Epic battle sequence that COMPLETELY butchers the last battle scene in ReturnOfTheKing into dust, there is nothing to stop this PERFECTLY SPECTACULAR MASTERPIECE from receiving ""the"" Oscar WIN for BEST PICTURE!!!

Well THE CHARACTER BUILDUP WAS DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 1 and the other 6 movies before it. What they wanted to do in this movie was to LET EVERYTHING OUT. The previous movies just did this one justice. It was an all out war in Hogwarts. I mean they gave almost every student a fighting scene if you was paying attention in the background. Some people might say there was too much Harry and not other characters. I MEAN COME ON this is THE FINALE ALL I WANT TO SEE IS HARRY AND HOW THIS FANTASTIC 10 YEAR EPIC ADVENTURE ENDS. The only part they could have probably improved on was the epilogue and that is probably it. Overall the acting the emotions and the scenes were very well played out. 10out of 10. PERFECT MOVIE,1

733,10.0,"I'm a 90s kid. I LITERALLY grew up reading, watching and absolutely LOVING the Harry Potter franchise films. I saw the first HP movie on its premiere when i was only 9, and having not read the books before, I was absolutely blown away with HP (I used to diss it but from this point, I was the biggest fan). As I grew up, so did the HP cast and I felt very emotionally attached to them as I kept on loving their movies. I was disappointed with films 5 - 7.5 and I really thought that David Yates had ruined the movies. However I was wrong as shown in this movie. Words aren't enough to describe this movie to the majority of teens around the world who grew up watching HP movies (like me). This is the first time I've literally burst out crying like mad in the cinemas. The Prince's Tale absolutely brought me to great big tears and My Previous fave HP movie (azkabhan) was overly topped by this one. In fact, I think this is my ALL TIME FAVE MOVIE. In my opinion, the Oscars have been ignoring the HP franchise way too much. This movie DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE AT THE Oscars. Most 90s kids internationally admit that this franchise has kept them laughing and entertained throughout their teenage years and a franchise other than HP has never been beloved and gave so much happiness to a generation globally. I not only cried at the absolute tear breaking moving emotions displayed through mind blowing acting my Dan Radcliffe (His acting has improved enormously through out the movies, but his acting in this one was Oscar WORTHY for BEST ACTOR full stop), but the terrible fact that with HP over, I feel that my childhood is over (it really is)and since I am so emotionally attached to HP characters, I couldn't easily let them go. With HP ended, I feel my youth is ending and it is. HP kept my teenage years with something to look forward to in the cinemas through 10 years, and no other franchise in the world has achieved that. HP is the BEST and most beloved franchise in the world to the 90s kids and it won't change because HP not only represents the height of entertainment in our era, but it represents our youth and joyful memories of our school days. I am still very sad that HP is over, more than anyone. I've read all the books, watched all the movies, but I have to say, this movie is the best of all, the perfect finish to a perfect franchise. And whatever other overrated franchises like twilight may be a better representation of their youth to the minority, the majority of 90s kids around the world will always pick HP as their all time favorite franchise ever. It will go down in history not only with success in numbers but in the hearts of 90s kids and other youth of this era. I would be very disappointed if Daniel Radcliffe who is obviously a very talented and hard working professional actor does not win Best actor at the Oscars, because I've never seen an actor at his age display a character with such ground breaking emotion and reality. I would be more disappointed if this movie does not win Best Picture at the Oscars, because this movie is not just a movie, but a form of happiness that have kept the youth of our era entertained for a decade and that is something that is not likely to be achieved even in the future.",1
734,7.0,"The first movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was really good, although I have never read the book, I loved it, and I wanted to see this one really badly, but it, I'm afraid, let me down tremendously. The roller coaster scene is unforgettable, and very well done. It's kind of funny and unexpected when they literally drop out of the cart. Other than that, the ending like, 45 minutes was really incredibly disappointing. It was stupid, and even with all the magic happening, seeing the whole time, pretty much two beams of light coming from a stick is boring, even when, sometimes an interesting thing happens in between each light display. Part 1 was really intense, and gave me a feeling as if a spider was crawling down my back, and there were very, very few, and short scenes like that in Part 2. I expected more.",0

I found the scene in pensive, the best part. I think is not as good as Fantastic Beasts, is because the visuals are more up to date and there is not much to be disappointed with because the book Fantastic Beasts does not have an actual plot.

I watched today, I have to admit that Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best-plotted, most-entertained one compared to its previous series movies.However, it's not as good as the ratings here IMHO, someone might say i'm being biased, but if you look at those top 50 movies which got the same ratings, i don't think this movie stand a chance to be equally great as the others.",1

The conclusion was extraordinary. The movie continues exactly as ""the deathly hollows part I"" has left of. thats right, u must see it the first half to assemble the pieces (don't worry I won't spoil). For all harry potter's fans this movie is awesome in all ways.

748,,"Tears came to my eyes from the first scene. I loved seeing the end play out and the series come to the close. But there is no doubt in my mind that the drive to make it 3-D drove the filmmakers to put too much emphasis on action and took away from character interactions. Sadly, I fear this is the future of films. I was very sad that they chose to pump up the fighting at the end but took out the wonderful scene of Percy Weasley's return to the fold. Also, Alberforth's story is reduced to a line or 2 and we learn nothing of Albus' abuse of power. Even the central revelation of Snape's back-story is reduced. This again, is triumph of special effects over character... and it was the characters that made these books great. It's worth seeing and fans will love it...but it could have been so much better.",1

750,8.0,"The movie depicts the death of the ego of the person and hence I believe the name is made as deathly hallows. It answers all the questions of the author put forth in the beginning of story of HP. It describes that the ego is of 7 categories(Crux). Out of them few of the Crux is present in a student which has to be destroyed by the Teacher(Dumbledore). Few destroyed by friends(Destroyed by Ron).And the rest has to be killed by the enemies(Voldemort). The strength of the confidence has to be taken by the aid of the Knowledge of the Teacher by either conversation or the gathering of the good will to prepare ourself to destroy the evil may be either external or internal. Story also depicts that when the evil in oneself raises to such an extent that it can cause the death of him, then its always power of knowledge which embodies to survive him(HP surviving after the deathly blow). I think the direction has brought the immense truth of the feelings of the message that is needed to be conveyed by the story writer. The existence of life of ego(Voldemort) within HP, is made felt of the presence by the scar on his forehead. The scar could have been on any other part, but still its on the forehead indicating that ego raises as he develops,grows. At the point in life hp reaches a stage where he needs to tackle his enemy Voldemort(ego) where the ego itself kills its mere existence in the Harry, then the Knowledge of DumbleDore flows through him for the perish of voldemort, to attain the state of Bliss.",1

David Heyman is an amazing producer but David Yates a completely fowl director. He ruined the fifth sixth and seventh film and so he did with the eight film. He cut of everything. The beginning was very good, but the battle was quiet miserable. Most of the things was shown in the trailer , what happened in the battle and there was too much Harry in the film. Ron and Hermione even didn't appear much and the stupid David Yates deleted many things from the memory of Snape. The dead scene of Fred was also omitted. Ariana's story gone!!! Duel of Hermione, Ginny and Luna with Bellatrix gone. And the battle of Harry & Voldemort though they made it a bit longer it was still disappointing. There was no one to see and and thus what is the proof that Voldy is dead???? The film was good and enjoyable but I think a lot more could be expected from this film.",1
753,,"The end is finally nigh, the conclusion of one of the greatest modern fairy tales of our time is now consigned to literary and movie history. I scarcely believe that J K Rowling herself could have imagined such a worldwide phenomenon that has made her one of the most respected novelists who ever put pen to paper. The story of a young boy who we have watched become a young man over the last ten years is now destined to meet his destiny and meet the dark Lord Voldermort. It all ends read the posters but who will it end for? Ms Rowling had already hinted that many of the characters would not survive with Dumbledore falling at the hands of Snape in part I. The task for our heroes is simple to destroy the dark lord you must destroy the horcruxes that contain a part of his soul. With three horcruxes destroyed in part I the trio must now find the remaining horcruxes which is no easy task with Voldermort extending his reign of terror to every corner of the wizard and muggle world. Time is running out and a confrontation of epic proportions is on the cards can good triumph over evil and can the boy who lived....live? A part of me is a little sad that's it over the global spectacle that has engrossed cinema and reading audiences is now coming to an end and it's going out in supreme style with the biggest weekend gross in history and paling into significance the box office takings of its predecessors and became the fastest movie to reach the six hundred million dollar mark in just eight days . But is it any good? In simple answer to that question yes it is! The magical world created by the J K Rowling has had some time to ingratiate itself within the hearts of minds of millions of loyal followers and casual cinema audiences alike and what's not to like. The cast assembled for these movies has been immense with the cream of the crop of British talent on offer and making stars out of the young actors chosen to carry the burden for all these years.",1

One of the best Harry Potter's of all time filled with such emotion. The acting was very good and strong, It was very sad to see them leave. However i didn't like how Bellatrix and Voldemort turn to ashes, and the ending i found poor. There was non stop action throughout the movie which i found very entertaining to watch and the darkest of the lot. One of my favourite scenes was when Voldemort killed Harry i found it exiting and thrilling. I will very much miss the Franchise a lot.",1

And, you know, I was about to cry when Snape was crying. I was like, BOO HOO D-; I will say it again, IT WAS AWESOME. Oh and crap when it was nineteen years later it was like aaaww its really over. Here is the beginning synopsis: After giving Dobby a proper burial at Shell Cottage, Harry speaks with Griphook the Goblin about breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts, as he believes that a Horcrux is hidden there. Griphook agrees to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Bellatrix's vault if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor in return. Harry then asks Ollivander, the wandmaker, to identify the wands they took from Malfoy Manor.

761,7.0,"This movie is a lot like that Genius student we all knew in College, who could have had a 4.0 but did not study and instead got a 3.0. The fact that this movie is good is more a testament to how great the story is. If you read the book you know some of the most important parts were either; excluded, rushed or just done badly. But in the end the overall story is so amazing that even a stripped down version is satisfying. Still the most disappointing part is that by splitting the book into 2 movies they had enough time to cover everything decently well. Instead they wasted time on irrelevant added scenes instead of showing the main fight/ending the way it should have been. In the end Harry and Voldemort circle each other as EVERYONE watched and Harry explained to Voldemort just how badly he had beaten him. In the end he even gave him a chance to feel remorse which he did not, Voldemort Loss is the ultimate Lost and Harry victory is the ultimate victory. But in the movie this is reduced to 3d effects. On top of that after the fight was over you could not tell if they had won or lost. There was no celebration, Hagrid patted Harry in the back like he had just won the spelling bee. I mean even if you did not read the book this is disappointing at that moment Harry just beat the most dangerous wizard of all time! he just ended the war! where is the celebration? There is more i could go into like how they rushed the pensive scene with the memories of Snape, but is useless because in the end people who just watch the movies are satisfied. But people who read the books know that it should have been amazing and instead it was just good.",0

Ignore them, they're silly. It's a bloody wonderful movie, one I would be happy to watch again and again, and I LOVE the books. It's a different medium, there are differences! And people talking about Crabbe just 'disappearing', well, the actor was arrested for drug charges? So no Harry Potter for him. But it is brilliant. Yes, some things were rushed, yes, some things didn't quite happen as expected. But it would be boring to watch a film that's exactly the same as its book. And 'die hard fans' should love it anyway, because... Well, it's Harry Potter.",1
763,,Being a fan of the series (not that big) I've read the series and seen the movies a few times. It was inevitable the longer the books of J.K. Rowling's fantasy world got the more difficult they'd translate to the big screen. Ultimately Harry Potter is a series and this means the stories carry the weight of information learned in the earlier books into the next one. This is where the great fault for the overall dull and butchered adaptation of Harry Potter series lies.,0
764,6.0,"I don't even know why people are raving about this. It was so terribly crappy. 4 hocruxes in 1 movie is like 2 LOTR in 2hrs combined altogether.

766,7.0,Harry Potter is by FAR the most overrated series ive ever watched. The fans do ruin it to a large extent but the films are also just predictable and boring. The last two did pleasantly surprise me though. The cheesy lines are replaced with actual humour and the action sequences are beautifully choreographed and fun to watch. The story line is deeper and darker than the rest of them (due to the change of director) which i believe is what this film series desperately needed. I will never understand why people love harry potter as much as they do but then again there are also people who believe the amazing spider-man 2 is good so apparently anything is possible now. Harry Potter on a whole is 4/10 but these last 2 are a solid 7/8-10 and David Yates saved these from plummeting to the ground.,1

Who basically ruined the whole franchise for the rest of the world. The characters are NOT real, get it into your thick American bum holes. I am glad that this whole hellish thing some people call Harry Potter is finally over. Now we can all get back to normality and focus on bigger issues such as Pandas and Penguins. Rather than being honoured for these so called 'books', J.K Rowling should be sent to the tower of London and forced to think about what she has done. Dumbledore is lucky enough to have died and not suffered the rest of the films. I feel sympathy for him to have lived through the first few film/books. The Twilight Saga is way better, even though it promotes Necrophilia, bloody violence and older men trying to get with teen aged girls. Long live Barney the Dinosour and The Tin Man.",0

I personally have never truly loved the Harry Potter films. I mean I like them, they are entertaining flicks no doubt about that, but they haven't held the special place in my heart that the sublime ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy have done.

The ending of this great series can hardly be better than this. All the actors acted brilliantly at the last part of the epic and almost everybody crossed their previous performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe wonderfully depicted the inner struggle of Harry Potter. Tears came into my eyes when Snape (Alan Rickman) was holding his beloved Lily Potter's dead body in total despair. Rupert and Emma did an excellent job too. Steve Kloves's screenplay is simply great however the final fight between Harry and Voldemort could have been more dramatic. David Yates has given his best shot although I liked the Half Blood Prince a little bit more because of its story-telling or just may be that was a better book than The Deathly Hallows. Again, the ending of this immensely popular series can hardly be better than this. Being a huge fan of Harry Potter series I must admit that the makers did a complete justice with the original story. One last thing I must say that I think both of The Deathly Hollows (Part 1 and 2) surpassed the J.K. Rowling's novel by holding viewer's interest till the end which was not possible with the last six parts as the books from Philosopher's Stone to Half Blood Prince were too damn good. Deathly Hollows (the novel) is quite good but surprisingly I found the movies of Deathly Hollows (especially part 2) more entertaining.",1
796,10.0,"Every now and then there comes a great movie that can't be explained without spoiling the events. This is one of them. Especially since this movie is the last one, closing the story of our four-eyed magician once and for all (maybe). How can I describe this movie without actually spoiling the content? (!!!) Well, I can't. I mean of course I can, but that would ruin the whole movie for you, and even though my heart is begging me to spoil everything, I want you to experience it for yourselves. I want you to feel the same way I did when I walked out of that cinema. And if you haven't read the book, do not worry since this is actually a great interpretation of the book unlike most of the previous movies (even though some minor things were off). I will give Harry Potter and the deathly hallows a perfect ten, and this based mainly on the flow of the movie. I loved the action, I loved the drama and I LOVED it all put together. But I will also give it perfect ten because of the way it made me feel. It made me feel sad on the sad moments, it made me feel happy on the happy parts, and it made my day at the end of the movie. Right now I only feel saddened because it is all over. But talk about going out with a bang!!!",1

800,6.0,I went into Deathly Hallows Part 2 excited the book (mainly the second half) was fantastic and Part 1 had been fairly loyal to the novel.,1
801,3.0,"Just the necessary end of a book adaption which goes worse and worse with every part. For example, the first and second have been good movies. But then the third which turns the book with the, in my opinion, most exciting story into a boring whatever. The fourth could be named as a ""nice try"" but everything after that was just boring stuff with exaggerated and obsessive special effects. One could get so much more out of this story, but also the last part was full of these things I've sad before: groundless protracted, useless effects, lame gags and a final battle that could'nt be more unspectacular; by the way: no more ideas since the fourth part, except this strange black and white smoke flying thing which is just ridiculous. no innovation, no profundity, no good film",0
802,10.0,Spoiler Alert!!!!!!! I went to the midnight show yesterday. The theater was packed. All the potter fans where extremely eager and excited to see the end of a very long and emotional journey. The movie started off with an amazing dark scene where dementors have surrounded Hogwarts and Professor Snape has become the headmaster of Hogwarts. The movie has its pace from the start as director David Yates is trying to fit as much as he can in this two hour flick.,1
803,8.0,A great finale to the HP series! It definitely culminates this 10 year series.,1
804,,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 marks the end of the reign of Lord Voldemort, and the end of the most successful movie franchise ever. I have to say that it was a fitting end to what has been an extremely exciting 10-year-long adventure. Although this was inevitable, and the ending was fairly predictable, even for those who had not read the book, this film was absolutely gripping, powerful and suspenseful, and characteristic of a classic ""cloak-and-dagger"" tale.",1
805,10.0,"I am not going to give any details here. Just in short, the movie is simply great! Just understand that it is practically impossible to show everything from the book in just 2 to 2.5 hours. Whatever is shown in the movie is just great, simply great, amazing and fully enjoyable. Obviously, if you have many expectations about each and every thing and you have already the book, then you might be disappointed about a few points. All the remaining horcruxes have been destroyed in the movie (obviously all of us know this;harry potter series cannot end without that). So some of the adventures have got very less time to emphasize their significance. But that does not really matter. Just go with zero expectations and you will come to know it is the best movie, Movie of the Decade. Just great! (watch in 3D)",1
806,,"I expected much after the Death hallows Part 1, but this one did not impress me. Although the effects were good but somewhere i felt disconnected. Frankly speaking Daniel can't act. Rupert and Emma are far far better than him. He is the weakest link in the film. And Alan Rickman gives a stunning performance throughout the franchisee. For me the story didn't turn up fascinating. I may be personal but definitely this wasn't what i expected this franchisee to end. The effects only can not make a film. If we are talking at effects then see lord of the rings. In acting part too it was far more superior to harry series. Probably this whole Harry series was a over hype after all. Again saying and I make it a statement Daniel can't act. Rupert and Emma has a great career ahead. Daniel will end up being just another Child Artist. Just like Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone series.",1
807,9.0,"I had read many reviews about this movie warning the book worms who were grabbed by the novel night after night (ME) that they would be disappointing at the end. I entered the theater with low expectations and left with an afterthought. Sure, the writers couldn't have fit the whole book into the movie! No matter what anyone says, it, under most circumstances, can not be done. For example, (For anyone who read the book) when the house elves in the kitchen at Hogwarts are in danger and Ron informs Hermione about this, she gives him a passionate kiss for remembering (not in the movie). However, it is not stated in the movies about Hermione's cause for House-elves (S.P.E.W.) or any of them even knowing that House-elves worked at Hogwarts period.",0
808,9.0,"Yates continues to cop criticism yet i think what he has done with the movies (Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2 especially) is amazing! Part 2 picks up right where part 1 left us, at Shell Cottage after the narrow escape from Malfoy Manor. From there on it takes us on a fast paced, action packed adventure and the visual effects that go with it are simply astounding. The movie takes you in with raw emotion aided by some terrific acting and the whole film seems to be crafted so well that it flows beautifully from start to finish. It is the proper goodbye to the series that has captivated millions and been going for 13 years strong. However, I had to take off one star due to one reason. (spoiler alert) The ending of the battle and how it had been changed from the book. Referring of course to the fight between Harry and Voldemort. I understand why it had to be changed, to make it more intense and dramatic for the cinema but i didn't care for it. ",1
809,10.0,"i watched this movie on its opening day here in Greece.the theater was completely full.i have read all the books.the final book was my favorite.i was a little worried if part 2 would stay true to the book.but turns out i was wrong.this is the best harry potter movie and for me it surpasses the book in some points.the acting is once again superb and the effects are BREATHTAKING.another thing i liked is that every character has its moment.for those of you who haven't read the book you can expect some pretty big twists.to conclude,if you are a fan of the books and movies don't miss this incredibly amazing and breathtaking finale which i hope will be an Oscar contender for best film.fingers crossed...",1
810,10.0,Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 is definitely the best movie in the series. It starts from where it left off. The baddie Lord Voldemort has stolen the most powerful wand from Dumbledore's grave.,1
811,,"Let me start out by saying that I am an absolute avid Harry Potter fan. I became addicted to the books when The Goblet of Fire was released when I was around 10 years old. Since then, I have probably read all of the books but the last two a good 20+ times. I love Harry Potter.",0
812,8.0,"Ten years ago, we were presented with a story on the silver screen about a boy wizard, whose parents were killed by a man named Voldemort. Along the way, he met Ron Weasley and Hermonie Granger, who became his party companions as he quested to learn more about himself and come closer to his ultimate destiny; to kill Lord Voldemort.",1
813,10.0,"This movie was amazing. It was wonderfully made and had great special effects. THough for many, Im sure, you will not hear good news about the last movie. If you would like to know why, read on. If not, oh well, you'll probably read on anyway. If you read what i just wrote you'd be reading on anyway. But, they would say it was not good because the ending mostly. The worst thing about the whole movie is they didn't end the movie (Voldemort dying) the way the book did. In the movie, he just flaked away when he died and no one saw him die. In the book, if i remember right, everyone saw that his own killing curse rebounded and hit him. THats not what happened in the movie. Also, in the epilogue, you could tell the actors only had a cheap amount of makeup put on because they only looked about a year older than they were minutes before (in the movie). But otherwise this movie was extremely exceptional in all perspectives! everything was made and set out well, and i even believe this was the funniest movie out of all 8! If you're a fan from the beginning, and you haven't seen it yet, of course, go see it because you will be amazed with the wonderful conclusion they have made to the series. Thanks for reading bye!!!!",1
814,5.0,"Forced comedy, poor acting (or maybe just a bad script), comically bad action sequences. It's not like they didn't have source material. I just can't understand how this us the highest rated HP movie of the series.",0
815,,SPOILERS BELOW.,0
816,,"Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.",1
817,10.0,"After 10 years and 7 movies, we finally reach the 8th and last movie chapter of the infinite Harry Potter and his friends, which made the author J.K. Rowling a millionaire. In this one, Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, are trying to find the three magic objects so they can defeat the dark Lord Voldemort. David Yates has the opportunity to use amazing special effects, where the adventure meets fantasy. This promising movie will let adult and young fans of Harry Potter literally speechless. So, is this one, Harry has already found a Horcrux. Now, he is looking for the other missing ones, and he is trying to find a way to destroy them. Nonetheless, he is also focusing on the very powerful wand that Voldemort has,Dumbledore's wand. Harry knows that since Voldemort has the Elder Wand, he can win the battle and he can rule the world of Magic. However, Harry doesn't give up, and with his friend's help he tries to defeat Voldemort.",1
818,5.0,"The 2nd part of JKR's best book, proved to be a quite mediocre film, directed in the wrong way and having also the script too much alternated. The first film was OK, although they wasted too much time. They could have begun directly in the 2nd movie with the Battle of Howgarts, saving time for their precious 2 hours and 15 minutes of the second instalment..",0
819,10.0,"As an avid Harry Potter fan, I was one of the multiple people who were wishing that this film would give us everything we wished for, and hopefully more. Being terrified that something wouldn't be quite right, I watched the movie with a clenched heart and was entirely pleased with what I saw. Not only was I wrenched into the movies as if I were a character, but as we followed Harry and his friends on their journey I found myself laughing, crying, and cheering for the Boy Who Lived. This movie is truly the perfect end to the magical series that most of us have followed for a decade. With this film, old and new fans from all over can officially lay down their wands and shout: 'Mischief Managed!'",1
820,10.0,"I love Harry Potter. I read all the books, multiple times, and I have loved every single movie. Even if they were different from the books at times. My favorite movie is Part 1, followed closely by Goblet of Fire. They, I feel like, have been closest to the books and that's why I love them so much.",1
821,10.0,"Such an amazing end to such a great film series. It keeps you on your seat with all of the different twists and action. You really feel as if you have grown up with the films and that the characters have grown up with you. The music, the props, costumes, make up etc are all brilliant! The acting is as great as ever from the cast. It is a very gripping and emotional end to the franchise. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to start the film franchise to do so.",1
822,9.0,"Even if you never cared much about the ""Harry Potter"" movies this one is worth seeing/buying. A+ hit...out of the park! I was skeptical of these so-called children's books being produced for the big screen, at first. But after my nieces & nephews talked me into making the 90min. round trip to our local theater a few times, all of the sudden I was hooked. Nothing like LOTR's, but never was intended to be. This last chapter in the ""HP"" series has got to be the biggest surprise to me of all. I expected a freeze dried ending with a little icing on top (after DH1). Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.If you watch ""DH1&2"" back to back...this gives the viewer a better idea of what I think the screen writers are trying to convey and absolutely gives the movie more of an even flow from beginning to end. Sounds excellent... I have a Bose 5:1 surround system and for visuals a Samsung LN46A650 and the visual are also A+ for this very well done blu-ray. It really is a keeper. Oh almost forgot the extras...you will need plenty of time examine them all. The DVD is also a nice touch. Put the blu-ray disc up for big people and the DVD a little lower for small hands on our precious little ones...is that not what our lives are really all about...they are our future.",1
823,,"""Ever since the First day i saw Happy potter in theater a decade ago till this day i loved it .. the movie began exactly from the last scene of Deathly hallows part 1 and it went darker into the story .Ralph Fiennes does a really amazing job at playing Lord Voldemort as he has done in all the previous movies.Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best choice that could be done for the character as he is nearly exactly what i was imagining what he would be like when i read the book. I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous.Thanks to David Yates for wonderful crafting it with minute details from the book ... and special not spoiling a dialogue from the original Book .like this one : ""Dumbledore: Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?....... 'for him?' shouted snape.'Expecto patronum!' from the tip of his wand burst a the silver doe:she landed on the office floor,bounded once across the office and soared out of the window.Dumbledore watched her fly away,and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape,and his eyes were full of tears. 'After all this time?' Always for Lily' said Snape ............. ""I literally had a tear"".you don't usually find a movie that grows along with you ,the characters ,the story ,those memories.If someone asks what is the most cherished memory that you have in your teenage i would say it's Watching Harry Potter in theaters.Don't wanna say more about just watch it in 3d magic before you miss a chance of a life time.Thank you J.K.Rowling for inspiring a Generation :) The Boy Wizard will Live in our Hearts Forever...",1
824,5.0,It's been almost ten years since the first Harry Potter film came out and now the series comes to a close. And what a fantastic and satisfying conclusion it is. It just about ranks up there with cinematic finales like The Return of the King and Toy Story 3. ,1
825,10.0,"""All great things come to an end"", but what when all great things come to end with a bang, leaving you gasped and longing for more.. As many would say, it's the end of a Legendary Era , but hardly do you feel it come true.. I admit that the previous parts had been losing that charisma and intensity set by the initial parts, but it's the time to revive, Cuz the universal hero Harry Potter gets a grand finale with Deathly Hallows Part 2. There's drama, action, terror, danger, death, special effects and loads of magic as the world's three most loved fictional characters meet their final destiny. But what makes the film really special is the high emotional quotient as heroes emerge from nowhere, lovers exchange love and longing neath the shadow of death and friends give a whole new meaning to friendship. Many a times, the film touches your heart and fills your eyes with a strange mistiness... something that rarely happened in the last few encounters.",1
826,10.0,"The harry potter franchise has gone on for ten years and it has been the most anticipated and rewarding franchise for people all around the world. The second part of the last installment is easily the best in the series, and is also probably one of the best movies of all time. If you've read the book you know exactly what to expect, because it is almost a movie just poured out of the book. If you haven't read the book, I will tell you this, the other movies in the franchise don't even compare to this one. This movie is emotional, action-packed the whole way through, and immensely satisfying for a conclusion to a franchise that has been going for over ten years. If you are a fan of harry potter or not, you should still see the movie because it is that good.",1
827,9.0,"Such an powerful and emotional finale to the magical franchise. I remember the very first time I watch the first film when I was very young. Eight films in ten years, from children to adults. Before the final Harry Potter film comes out, I was afraid it may disappoint me, afraid of creating a negative review, even I have to if it's bad. But I was wrong. This film is really good, tied up neatly. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows brings the Harry Potter to an satisfying, epic conclusion.",1
828,,"Firstly, do not go and watch this film expecting to see the pages of the book replicated word for word and scene by scene- if you do this you will inevitably be disappointed and therefore I am not going to compare the film to the book. I should also point out that I am a huge fan of the series and have grown up watching these films, and expected great things from the grand finale. Did it live up to these expectations? Are you sitting comfortably? Good, then I shall begin.",1
829,,"I was really worried about this last movie. Part 1 was good, but I knew that wouldn't mean this one was gonna be. Luckily, they pulled it of. In the beginning I was worried. It seemed as if things were happening to fast and that they didn't really make the Gringotts scene as big and meaningful as I felt it was in the book. Of course, if this was happening in the middle of a movie, which it would if the two parts were put together, it wouldn't be very strange. Still, even for that it was too fast, in my opinion. However, the movie picked up very well after that. Things slowed down, and you started to feel everything that was happening. Now I'm not an enormous Harry Potter fan, though I've read the books and seen the movies, so I might not even remember all the details that they might have missed. Still, to say that it was bad of them not to include more stuff, is unfair. Most Harry Potter books are fatter than holy hell, and even though the last one wasn't as big as for example the fifth, it still contained lots of information and details in the storyline, and trying to squeeze that in to two movies would be impossible. They managed to put a lot of the story into part 2, and I think they did it well. Even though for example Snapes memory scene was shorter than I had hoped, it still gave you the right feel. And of course the big battle could have been shown a little more, you know just a few minutes of footage of people killin' each other and stuff blowing up. That would have been nice. Fred's death was also a little to ""small"" They should have made a bigger deal out of it. But considering all the good qualities of the film (especially CGI and the way they played out a lot of key moments, like the thing where Harry almost dies and goes to the train station thing, I loved that) it hardly even matters to me that they did some stuff differently. And yeah, the final fight scene between Harry and Voldemort, so what if they weren't in the middle of a crowd, seriously, who gives a crap? Loved that they included the ""19 years later scene"". Too bad that they didn't make more out of it, but once again: Who gives a crap? Overall, Great movie, a totally fine ending to the Harry Potter series.",1
830,8.0,"First of all I'd like to say I really enjoyed this film, the Potter series has never been perfect but I'd say this last one came pretty close to it. Being someone who was a big fan of the books there are some things I wish they hadn't left out or changed. I feel like they didn't do the deaths of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks justice. They simply showed each dead body for a few moments and kept on going. Another thing they left out was the centaur charge. Instead of including this heroic moment, they simply had Harry jump out of Hagrid's hands and run off...not in line with the book at all. Now hey, don't get me wrong, I know I just pointed out a few negatives but there were way more positives than negatives. The acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and you really walked out of the theater feeling a lot of closure. Everything just tied together, it was wonderful. The scene with Harry sending his children to Hogwarts was great, I was really glad they included the epilogue in the film. All in all, I would strongly recommend this movie to any movie goer, and any Potter fan for that matter so long as they don't mind a few tweaks from the book.",1
831,10.0,"Oh My God. This film is just fantastic. it makes you cry, happy and just scream with joy. I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much. The acting is top notch, the effects are dazzling and just the fact it's in 2 parts is awesome. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were again amazing as the three heroes Harry, Hermoine and Ron. But, Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom) and Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) had their big moments in this film. I cried when people died and had to close my eyes when my favourite character dies. The beginning with Grainsgotts what fantastic and the end with the Hogwarts Battle was just Epic! I am also happy that they didn't use different actors for the 19 years later scene.",1
832,1.0,"Rowling ends both the book and the movie in an appalling manner! By allowing the vanquished Slytherin house with it's evil Snake crest to remain active at Hogwarts at tne end of the second Wizarding World War. Moreover, she didn't close down the death-eater's portraits which she breathed immortal life into. In the books Rowling created, the portraits themselves are sentient; able to speak as if still alive. They are also portals to other portraits and have every means available to them to re-group, re-organize and start another literary world war. Beatrix Lestrange for instance, would surely enjoy training a pack of new slytherins with her dark magic and cruel intent, with only one aim. To destroy the world of good magic, and to take over the human world by force. ",1
833,10.0,"I went to this at midnight and it was super worth it!! Between Mrs. Wesley's special line and the fighting, it was just like the book. You should go see it if you haven't!! It was an epic ending to an epic series and I don't know if there will anything as epic ever again. I begin reading these a while back and now I own all the movies and books plus a tee shirt. I never imagined I could be so hooked. So if you are a fan, or you're looking for a movie to see, I recommend Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The ending death was epic, along with the sadness of losing Tonks, one of the Wesley twins and many more. So, sit back, relax and enjoy it. It will last for generations to come.",1
834,,A must see film and will keep you on the edge of your seat. All actors shine in this final Harry Potter film and have done a fantastic job in the past films. The battle was brilliant and kept me entertained. Snape's memories made me emotional and that is why the film gets a 9/10 from me. I also liked to see the characters all grown up at the end and it gives the perfect send off to the series. I was entertained the whole way through and the special effects were amazing and realistic. Watching these films have been a privilege and a honor and it shows what Hollywood can really do. I hope J.K Rowling does decide to write at least one more book?,1
835,,"Harry Potter is one of the most spectacular film franchises in film history. And if you ask me Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best out of all the other films. It finally ends the long battle between good and evil. It all ends at Hogwarts where Harry must find the remaining Horcruxes to stop Voldemort (Crap I said his name!!!) once and for all. The Battle of Hogwarts is the most exciting thing in the movie. The special effects are amazing and was directed very well. David Yates was the perfect director for the last films. The film has a excellent ending where Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione's children all go off to Hogwarts to start their own adventures. It is the perfect end to a perfect series. But, even if the movies are over, we still have the books too to take us back to where it all began.",1

Harry Potter and his two best friends continued to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes before finally dealing with Lord Voldemort. ",1

Becoming a billionaire is not about having a billion dollars, but about becoming the kind of person to make a billion dollars.<br /><br />We need to make the right choices, and we will make the right choices when the choices are aligned with our values.<br /><br />We can either let the world sort us and mould us based on the abilities and attitudes that we have, or we can make our choices and turn into the kind of people that need to make those choices come true.",1

860,9.0,This film gives justice to the book which I am very happy about. The princes tale sequence was done extraordinarily and gives me chills every time. There are some awkward silences but this film is perfect none the less.,1
861,10.0,"This movie was definitely one of the best out of the eight. It included most major events and had effects that will blow your mind. As a true fan of the books I was a little angry at how they played out some of the battle. Here is my list 1) I wish they would have started the battle as they did in the book. It was similar but Snape never addresses the school and Harry, they only briefly meet in the hallway. 2) Some of the old characters that I was sooo excited to see return (Harry's old quidditch team, buckbeak) did not return as they did in the book. 3) There was a bit to much humor in certain moments that were supposed to be dark and intense. 4) They showed Fred dead but not his death, which was described in the book. They also left out the Weasleys' reunion with Percy, but it was expected as this conflict went back to the fifth book. Harry Going down to the Forbidden Forest, Harry never confronts anyone after he realizes what he has to do, as mentioned in the book Hermoine and Ron would have never let him go 5) The way Harry presented himself alive was different. In the book, Voldemort brings him up and gives his speech of liberation, and then and there Neville kills the snake, in which another fight breaks out. Harry slips on his cloak and watches as Hermoine, Ginny, and Luna battle Bellatrix and McGonnagal, Slughorn, and Kingsley battle Voldemort. The crowd gathers around these two fights until Molly Weasley steps in and kills Bellatrix. Voldemort then aims at her, until Harry protects her, revealing himself. Then they go on the circle each other and Harry explains why Voldemort cannot win. It was very intense in the book and it would to be in the movie. There was no chase scene around Hogwarts or diving off the tower, as there was in the movie Harry kills him and the Death Eaters run and the good storm Harry. In the movie no one sees him kill Voldemort and there really isn't a celebration. 6) Barely no Hagrid! I was beginning to think they left him out until they showed him tied up. I wish they showed him fighting. Also no Gwarp. (Hagrid's giant half-brother) 7) In the book Voldemort cannot feel when they destroy a Horcrux. 8) Voldemort kills Snape in the Shrieking Shack in the book but for some reason in the movie it was at the boathouse. That kinda bothered me. 9) If I had not read the books I would have been confused on the Tonks and Lupin relationship. They never actually say they got married or had a kid. Tonks mentions her husband and Harry later asks the ghost of Lupin about his son Teddy, who was never mentioned until that point. 10) They stayed away from the whole Dumbledore conflict, which i understand because it would have been hard to explain on top of everything else 11) Harry never breaks the Elder Wand, but uses it to repair his own, which was broken. He returns it to Dumbledore's grave and hopes that it will die with Harry, passing on to no one.",1
862,10.0,"This film is the final film in the harry potter series. I think it's a classic, thought-provoking good movie! After the movie ended, I was still immersed in such a wonderful magical world that the movie showed us.Snape is one of my favorite and most beloved characters, Before that, I thought he was a stuffy, greasy, overly strict, evil man, and the ending really surprised me.And one of his conversations with Dumbledore left me in tears!<br /><br />""After all this times?""<br /><br />""Always.""<br /><br />Thank you Rowling for giving us such a wonderful magical world, describes us a group of vivid, interesting and memorable characters.Come back sometimes, muggles, or avada kedavra!",1

And while it's understandable there were some time constraints, so much was left out or altered that I wish could be put into an extended edition.<br /><br />Overall, totally worth the time to watch. Just don't expect a word-for-word translation into film, especially the very end.",1
864,,"As a huge fan of the books, yes I loved this movie. I am giving it 10 stars as it was definitely full-filling as the end of the series - however I am looking at the last few movies as more of a ""cliff-notes"" version of the books.",1
865,,"The final piece of a decade of Harry Potter movies is in many ways a worthy conclusion, but just as much a mere shadow of the novels' superb storyline. It was most impressive to see the darkness and despair that had build up over the -let's say ""prequels"" to HP&TDH2- come to a climax here, which in my opinion is the key to the final book. The long shadow of catastrophic events to come was still echoing in my mind from Part 1 and I was very excited when I went to see HP&TDH2. One one hand I was amazed how much thrill this production was able to generate, as I had read the book and knew what was going to happen. On the other hand I must say that not only the tension that should / could have been arching over Part 1 & 2 was missing somehow. But also -over the attempt to create a movie that was able to live up to the huge expectations of the audience, HP&TDH2 had become trivial and hollow in many scenes. Why not take a little more time to make ALL the important scenes count? What with the hasty kiss between Hermione & Ron, Dumbledore's brother or Harry having to cope with the facts that the price of victory will be the most terrifying for him? Action-wise it was fun to watch, -not superb as an action movie, but great as a final Harry Potter film. What disappointed me most was the weak ending. The production team could have done a better job, as the final battle between harry and Voldemort just couldn't create that feeling of a cinematographic climax; there was no thrill of this special moment just before a catastrophe is about to happen. As a Harry Potter fan I must say to the production team: OK, a movie simply can't reproduce all the charm and depth of the books. But in the end you just missed the important parts. The final book is NOT about action or an epic showdown. ",1

This was not absolutely not epic ending at all for Mr. Potter and the fans ! ... The end was the cheapest in any franchise ! Overall a great movie , good VFX not better than Transformers 3 thought of course , a cheap finale and an awful 3D . I speak honestly without any influence ! I think Transformers : Dark Of The Moon 3 is the best movie this year out there both in 3D and in the story :) Overall 7/10 because Mr.Potter deserved a better ending more epic and more impressive ! 10 years this ending was a lame Mr.Yates !",1

The cinematography is breathtaking Looking at Scotland ,England ,and Wales was great. The acting in the film was outstanding I expect Alan Rickman to get an Oscar nod next year for his powerful performance as Snape ,Also Ralph fienes as Lord Voldemort could get a nomination. Daniel Radcliffe is a talented actor who is Harry Potter. His performance carried us the audience threw eight films ,but he was not alone, Jason Issacs Tom Felton Bonnie Wright Emma Watson Rupert Grint Helana Bonahm Carter Julie Walters Gary Oldman David Thewlis Emma Thompson John Hurt with Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Michael Gambon to name a few give the film their all ,and help Radcliffe go from boy to hero is just 7 years.

Snape is aware of harry's presence on the grounds, death eaters are everywhere. this isn't the Hogwarts you remember 2 films ago. and thats when we really get into the thick of all of the action. some people complained that the battle of Hogwarts isn't very battle like. and thats a lie, the battle of Hogwarts has some of the best cgi effects that you'll see in a movie. from the giant mountain trolls, to the death eaters blowing apart the sections of the castle. but its not about the action its all about the emotion that is in this crazy battle. we see some of the lead characters laying face first in the rubble. but the most disturbing part of the battle was lavender brown having her neck chewed on by",1

The Harry Potter series is one that has touched the hearts of millions of people on this earth, and I am one out of those millions! The film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 2 is truly epic. Joe Rowling created a world that touched the hearts of millions, and David Yates brought that onto the screen for ALL to see. Even though there were many 'liberties' taken by the director, it didn't even effect the grade of quality. The plot of thick, the effects were top-notch, the music out OUTSTANDING, and the cast had the great chemistry that makes you fall with love with their work. Over-all, the final installation of the Harry Potter series truly head up to its expectations. I watched it eight times in theaters, I own it on DVD, and the soundtrack is next on my list. If you are looking for a movie that fulfills expectations, and you can watch again and again Pick up Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!",1

I love the books more than the movies but I do realize that not every word of the book can be reproduced in the film due to many budgetary and technical reasons, so my focus will remain to the film only. 2. I watched the film in 2D screening, my rating may have been different considering the experience, but I am sure it won't play much part in this movie.",0

They could have done unbelievably better in time management about horocruxes and the battle scenes in general were not very intense. If this wasn't the last film, I would not go to see the next. The only good part was how the Deathly Hollows were portrayed. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint as always are perfect in their roles. It is unfortunate that the screenplay writer, Steve Kloves and director, David Yates had to adapt the books to film in such a way because the last film had great potential. Still worth watching only because it is the last film.",1

All these actors give groundbreaking performances in making this the final movie. The movie definitely executed the main points of the movie, and made it feel so real and touching. Harry Potter fans and non Harry Potter will definitely love this movie. I was given the advantage to go to the midnight showing and the whole theater was in complete silence the whole movie, and you could even hear and see people shedding tears. It is an AWESOME movie, and it really does justice for the end of Harry Potter. I have read all the books, and seen all the movies, and this one has to be the best movie. I knew what was gonna happen and still had me on the edge of my seat, and I suggest this movie to everyone! It will not be a waste of your money. Great movie, great people, great ending. Harry Potter will live on forever.",1

Now I watched the first Harry Potter movie when I was at the age of 5 and it is so amazing that I grew up with this series. Now, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was a great ending to this series. Some people say it really different from the book and I can't agree more. The thing is, this is great as an overall movie and I loved it. People were complaining about the death of Fred Weasley being such a small part of the movie but the truth is that the actor of George Weasley(Oliver Phelps) couldn't shoot the part for too long because seeing his brother dead was very emotional for him. The special effects were great! Hogwarts was looking like a real destroyed building and the explosions were great. Severus Snape's death was great and some of the actors perfected their parts. They made a great scene with James, Lily, Sirus, and Remus talking to Harry when he finds the Resurrection Stone and the death of Harry is also great when Dumbledore gets there. Neville did great too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie to watch",1

I think the only thing I'd like to point out is at the end were they show the children from our favorite main characters I honestly think you should continue the series by making movies about them now like Harry Potter: Next Generation and keep it going it would be nice to watch their kids fall in love and get into which houses and watch their lives grow as kids just like their parents did. I really think it would make us as the views more happier because leaving it off with nothing else sucks and shouldn't be how movies should end.,1

There is more action, more sacrifice and a feeling of completion that Part One didn't have. Once again the burden is on Harry Potter and he rises to the occasion, but at what cost? I think that movie goers who have not read the book, may enjoy the film even more than those who have read the book. The surprises that lay ahead and the complexity of certain characters will keep you on the edge of your seat.

901,6.0,"I don't leave reviews but this movie this series was so great until the very end. Why does everything work out for harry it shouldn't. I get why they revived him in the end but this idealistic ideal that all should end perfectly is garbage. I really thought the plot armor but be removed, this movie started so amazingly then the ending. It would been so much more meaningful if they used Draco. Why? it wouldn't be hard he would say no to Voldemort and kill the snake then it would go the same until they jump out the window then they both die. Imagine the impact, harry really dead, proving Voldemort was such a challenge Harry actually had to die. Nothing felt real after they brought him back I just knew that it work out I felt nothing in the fight because I knew it was to obvious he should have died, Draco should have been redeemed. But some other problems, how selfish of Harry when he just threw away the resection stone. I don't care if Harry is going to see his family again I don't care about what happens to harry I don't care that Harry is ready I care that Ron just lost his brother that Remus's son has no father or mother and I care that Snape is dead. He could have done so much he could have thanked Snape but he didn't, he didn't think about anyone but himself just because he was okay doesn't everyone else was he forgets that other people died. When he sacrifices himself it loses all meaning when he lives again nothing he did mattered. He had everything he could have done so much good but he didn't. Also what the hell happened will Albus why? why? he knew, he learnt Ablus never cared yet he put him on the same level as Snape I accept that Snape had a weird obsession with lily but he did good with that ,he was a hero, Albus as Snape said, reared harry for death like a pig. And Harry knowing this still named his son after him, its pathetic. I would give this a two if the beginning and middle and most of the fight weren't so good the ending is absolute garbage face it Harry is selfish always has been everything, he did his treatment of everyone, its horrifying other movies had problems yes I know but those were nessicary this wasn't, this was bad, just bad just if you watch this just know the ending is bad.",0
902,7.0,"I don't really know how to describe this movie, so I'll make use of my Spanish and say that Part II was ""asi-asi"". Yes, it is arguably the greatest saga ever told, probably the greatest I will be alive for, but as a stand-alone movie, it was mediocre. The writers/director overlooked numerous subplots from the book, and the movie felt a little impersonal. When the big battles come, and you are watching characters you fell in love with almost a decade ago meet an untimely end, you don't get very emotional like you should because it all happens so fast. Half of the heartfelt moments of the movie are basically summed up in one or two lines with melodramatic acting/writing. Not a terrible job by any of the actors, but this movie deserved a better effort all around. Not Oscar worthy in the least bit, not epic enough in the least bit, but not worth avoiding. Despite all my negative words, I do not believe this movie did harm to the Potter series, it just should have been better. I give it a 7/10 because I still enjoyed my movie going experience.",0

The most disappointing part for me was the fight between Harry and Voldemort. It just didn't connect like it did in the book. It was a good end to the series, but seriously, to end the main time line by them holding hands and having the camera fade out? Couldn't be more cringe-worthy. Sure there was a few laughs now and then, but that is expected with the type of story the book tells.",1

Since David Yates started to direct the movies I think he stopped paying attention to that part, to the friendship part. the book is full of funny incredible dialogues and in the movies they don't appear anywhere. I think Neville Longbottom talked more in this movie than Ron and Hermione put together in both parts. Ron is funny yes, but not as funny as in the books, Hermione is so... not- Hermione like, Emma lost all her sassiness and high airs she used to have in the first movies.

912,,"I do wish everyone would stop comparing the Harry Potter movies with the Harry Potter books!! This has been going on as long as they have been making the movies and I am sick of it. I never read any of the books and therefore went into the first movie with an open mind. I saw the final film today, and I must say, the complete saga of Harry Potter and his adventures has been thrilling, exciting, rollicking adventure and one of the best book to movie series that I have ever seen. For me, the phrase ""based on the book by J.K. Rowling"" does not mean that I am going to see a page by page representation of the book on the screen. Even if I had read the book, I would not expect such an adaptation. It just can't be done. They've been trashing Ian Fleming's James Bond books for decades now, and still, millions of people are rabid fans of the character of James Bond. Lines go around the block when the latest James Bond film appears at the local cinema. Yet, there hasn't been a Bond film that actually followed a Fleming original story in years! Those of you who have an issue with the movies should accept the fact that the books stand on their own, but so do the movies. The script writers worked with the material they had, along with input from the author and the time constraints that they were given by the studio. Under these conditions, they made the best set of movies possible. Everything in a book cannot possibly appear in a film, and if your favorite scene is missing, then I suggest that you go back and re-read the book so that you can capture the scene as J.K. Rowling envisioned it. Even if J.K. Rowling had written the scripts for each of the movies, do I believe that everything from the books would have made it onto the screen. A movie - based on a book - will always be a compressed, rewritten version of the original source material. This is the way it has been for over 50 years, and the way that it will continue for long into the 21st century!",1

Good bye to them and I hope to never see anything along the lines of Harry Potter come out anymore. There was only one good few minutes of the movie and that was when the previews and credits were rolling.",0

920,10.0,"The Harry Potter series is somehow a masterpiece. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is emotional for long time fans and new fans. They movie is what I didn't expect and more. This movie ends the series beautifully and magically, no pun intended. This series is the greatest of all time and nothing will be to top it. David Yates does an amazing job showcasing Voldemort and Harry's relationship. The way war is shown in the Wizarding world is amazing and only David Yates and J.K. Rowling are the only ones that can do it well. This movie is amazing.",1
921,10.0,"As the tagline says it all ends here! Watch the movie in 3D for the best experience you can get. The movie takes you on an unforgettable journey through a world filled with good and evil and which triumph over what and how it all happens. The story is filled with emotions, sentiments, twists, turns, stunts, action and all the right ingredients which makes one Humongous BLOCKBUSTER! Please be sure that you have seen the previous Harry Potter movies cause this one has lots of flashbacks and memories and you would be pretty much confused if you haven't seen the other ones. This movie is one of the very few movies which has utilised 3D technology to the maximum.",1
922,9.0,"I love this movie and the whole series to death. Amazing close to the series, could of have more but AMAZING! Only big thing I hated was the romance. Ginny was annoying and Harry and Hermoine are perfect together. But aside that, AMAZING MOVIE. Hope to see a 1-8 movie collection. If you have not seen this movie and you are just the little of an Harry Potter fan, see this movie! I didn't get to see this movie till today and after I wished to see it at premiere. The best movie and the series and the best series of movies and books. Long Live Harry Potter. We will all miss you Harry Potter. Thank You J.K. Rowling. Epic.",1
923,9.0,"I have now been to see the second part of harry potter twice and both times have been impressed with how good the graphics and acting of the three main characters are, however i was disappointed that it did not stick to the book as much as part 1. My main problems were:",0
924,10.0,"This is the Best movie series I have seen according to my knowledge. I'm really sad because we will not be able to see any more HARRY POTTER movies again. Out of the 8 movies first 3 and Deathly Hallows Part 2 are my favorites. Unlike other movie series ""Harry potter"" had a good plan from the beginning to the end the movies were well connected with each other. This movie series will never be forgotten for centuries. it is equally enjoyable to both children and adults. I would like to thank everyone who did such a great job. Specially J.K. Rowling who is the master mind behind all of this. And all the actors who did their best. And all other people who contributed. Hope to see more harry potter movies.... But as it says IT ALL ENDS :(",1
925,10.0,"I had been waiting for this day to arrive for more than an year & when it did arrive, I was not at all disappointed. I went to watch the movie with some friends of mine who considered the Harry Potter series as a mere 'children's story'. Two hours later, when the credits rolled, all of them said in unison, ""We regret not having read the 7 books"". It's a film keeps you ""spell-bound"". It is, like somebody already mentioned, an action-packed emotional roller-coaster - one moment your heart beats hard thanks to the spectacular special effects and Alexandre Desplat's amazing background score and the next moment your eyes brim with tears seeing the fate of some of our dear characters. I couldn't watch the movie in 3D since it runs in a 2D theater in my city; but that didn't prevent me from giving the movie 10 out of 10. Having said all these, I think it's needless to add that it's the best Harry Potter film till date; in fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life!!. I really didn't feel like leaving the theater when the film ended; I felt like something very very very very very(& an infinitely more 'verys') precious had just ended. I could see the girl sitting next to me breaking into tears when the credits rolled and my heart was brimming with even more tears. It's a wonderful ending to an immortal series. Thanks a lot David Yates & team and, of course, J.K. Rowling for giving us such a wonderful story,which is a perfect blend of friendship, love, bravery, emotions & many more. 'EPIC' is an understatement!!",1
926,10.0,"This movie is really close to my heart for the reason that this is the last one from Harry Potter. Overall, the movie was really enjoyable and the action scenes were perfectly portrayed. ",1
927,10.0,"The movie was made in two parts with the objective of staying true to the book but while the first part of the Deathly Hallows seems to be extended, slow paced while the second part seems to have left some details & altered the others.These changes however make the movie more cinematic, easy to understand which would please most of the people.The people who were fans of the book however would be disappointed by certain lack of detail which was evident when the person sitting next to me at the theater was missing the ""Expelliarmus""(Harry's favorite/TM spell) & jumping at how harry finds the fifth horcrux was different. Though i agree on the part that the book had some rich detail which would have made some great scenes but despite of all this the main plot is still there & makes for an enjoyable movie with action paced scenes, great soundtrack & some moments of laughter. Yates delivers by focusing on visual details which results in mesmerizing & encapsulating battles & emotional scenes(like the one in the end) which would stay in the heart of people for many years. Movie is close to perfect & a fitting end to the story.",1
928,8.0,"I have read the books repeatedly and seen the movies more times than I can count. I loved this movie, but was disappointed with all the liberties they took. A lot of the movie held true and all in all it was great fun to watch. I spent a lot of time on the edge of my seat, and the special effects were amazing. I heard a lot of crying at times, and the audience gave a great cheer at some points too. There was some comic relief interspersed with the highly emotionally charged story. I feel it didn't need to be in 3D, but it did add a sense of ""cool"" to the movie at times. It didn't include a lot of things from the book I was really hoping to see. I was also surprised at how short it was. In the beginning, some things were just left out, but then the movie went in a whole new direction and I found myself thinking, ""but that didn't happen that way in the book!"" Overall, it was still awesome to watch and I highly recommend it as with all the Harry Potter books and flicks.",1
929,10.0,"by far one of the best endings to a series, it wasn't flawless, but it wasn't horrid, much like goblet of fire (which took out too much of the book and added hardly anything. this movie is my all time favorite Potter movie, well until Fantastic Beasts and where to find them comes out, that looks so good that it might get close to this amazing movie. i love how they brought this story together, mostly stayed true to the book and just amazing acting. Emma, Daniel and Rupert just blew me away, as did all the other actors, especially Alan R. hope i get blown away by the spin-off that i mentioned before. J.K. Rowling i thank you for making this awesome story and allowing the movies to be made.",1
930,10.0,"first of all its brilliant,I mean its packed with the stuff that a harry potter fan needs the best of all harry potter films.. its been beautiful as the boy has grown and now given an epic send off.",1
931,,We have finally arrived at the end of the best fantasy series of our time: Harry Potter. Uhm...that distant bustle you are hearing are millions of Potter fanatics still rushing to their local cinemas to watch/re-watch the last installment of the HP movies. And their eagerness will be rewarded because this film does not disappoint! There is just one word to describe Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2: Wow! And if you're going to see it in IMAX 3D: double wow! This may be the last film in the series but the producers have made sure that nobody will forget it easily.,1
932,10.0,"I'm going to make this review as brief as possible. Deathly Hallows Part 2 was great. I went to see it last night at midnight, and i must say, i was blown away. I love music, especially musical scores in films; this movie had a GREAT musical score. The special effects were like nothing I've seen before in any of the Harry Potter films. The action sequences were fun and not too worn out,combined with the truly epic music, it made for some truly epic moments in the film. I have read every book and seen every film, so there were many moments where i found myself crying, and those tear-jerking moments nearly stole the film away, and might even have for other people. The final battle between Harry and Voldemort is insane, I found myself and many other on the edge of their seat as the showdown ensued, which only added another layer of epicness to the movie. There was stuff added and removed from the book version, but thats okay, to the common movie-goer who wants to see a Grade A summer film, they wont know the difference. David Yates did a great job directing and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was Oscar nominated! ",1
933,,"this movie was just amazing. i saw it 3 times. Many are complaining that they left out a lot but in an interview with the writers they made sure to mainly focus on Harry Potter since he is the main character. they would have included more details on other characters but the main story is about Harry and adding other stuff would have made part 2 a 4 hours movie. The movie had amazing graphics and all the acting was believable. Allan Rickman had an amazing performance and changed the whole perspective of the character Snape. His work was just touching and heartbreaking. Daniel, Rupert, and Emma as always gave a thrilling performance. Maggie Smith added a lot of humor to the movie even in the dark times. Ralph as Voldemort was brilliant and portrayed him excellently. If you haven't seen the movie yet i HIGHLY recommend it. Another thing about Harry Potter which is so great is that although there is love it is not the main highlight liked Twilight. These movies are great for an audience of 7-100 year olds. There are no swears or sex. It is purely about friendship, bravery, and fighting for what is right and good. BEST SERIES IN THE WORLD. It will live on forever",1

935,10.0,"Holding this DVD shifted from USA after 5 months of the releasing date, there's no words that can express my feeling. There was a huge mistake that WB didn't show this last part in our country, therefore I have to wait for a very long time.",1
936,10.0,"Picking up immediately where Part 1 left off, we find Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still out hunting Horcruxes, magical pieces that gives them the key to taking out Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). So we see them going on their search through Diagon Alley for the first few minutes of the movie, and then we see them return to Hogwarts for the ultimate showdown.",1
937,,"No spoilers on what they messed up, but let me say they got some of the main parts of the book wrong, which was devastating to watch. The entire time I only thought about how 'hey that didn't happen... no it's the other way around... wait what?... they totally left that part out!'",0
938,10.0,A MUST WATCH. Total entertainer with ample doses of heart-filled excitement. The suspense created in the 1st half is acutely executed with a brilliant end. Harry Potter Series really ends in style. This is one is certainly the best of the lot. Honestly being a crazy fan can't think of any negative points to this one. Maybe since the last part the time-line could have been a little longer something about 2hrs 30mins. The last part surely made me emotional. Perhaps it would have been little better if the character of Severus Snape could be given in a little more detail and maybe the final duel could have been a little fearsome. But the nonetheless THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT.,1
939,10.0,"As expected, the final chapter in the epic saga of Harry Potter is not only a fantastic final chapter to the franchise, but one of the best movies in the entire series. Everything that we've all been waiting and hoping for is here, and even better than we expected.",1
940,,"I have anticipated seeing this film ever since I read Deathly Hallows when it was first released. Having said that, I went to the midnight showing (my first midnight showing for anything). All I can say is the final battle is extremely epic at the end of the book and the film adaption of it falls nothing short of that. The special effects were beyond terrific. Acting- at its peak. And while the film differs in various ways from the book, it still captures the emotion and heart of what the Harry Potter series is about.",1
941,8.0,"This final movie in Harry Potter series is everything an average viewer expected. From the opening scene to the climax, entire movie is captivating. Background score is good and all the characters in this film performed their roles so good that you cannot imagine anyone else doing it. ",0
942,7.0,"NO spoilers in this review. :) I caught the very first midnight showing of this movie at my local theater so there was lots of audience reaction and participation throughout the roughly two and a half hour premier. A few minutes before it started we got to see some behind the scenes snippets from other HP movies, including a screen test and with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson reading the script together prior to filming Sorcerer's Stone.",0
943,10.0,"The final film was perfect to end it all off. Some key moments that were a lot like the book were the ending of Harry's talk with dumbledor where dumbledor said if it's in your head that doesn't mean it's not real, when Harry gets the resurrection stone, when he gives himself up to voldemort, when Snape is dying, and the way that Harry sees that lupin and tonks are dead. Some things that were added to the film were, that Harry jumped off a bridge clutching voldemort, the way that Bellatrix died, the chamber of secrets showing, the extra time added on to killing nagini, and McGonnagal casting her spell and loving doing that. Some people think that this film is bad because it adds parts and skips out parts from the book, however what we need to remember is that we don't want to pay 20 dollars to see a movie or buy a movie that we already know everything about.",1
944,10.0,"Harry Potter has been something i have cherished through the years, now that it is over i am quite sad. The last Harry Potter film(s) that was based on the 7th book in the Harry Potter Series, was announced to be a split movie. when i first heard this i was very unsure. it seemed like a money making idea by WB as people would have to pay 2 admission fees instead of 1. The first part was very slow and just a general hype up for a big finish. Now the second part of the last Harry Potter left me happy even though as the posters say 'it had all ended' This is the first Potter movie where i was actually impressed by Director David Yates as he captured all elements of the film in accordance to the book very well indeed. He did have some assistance by two outstanding acting performances with Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes playing Severus Snape and Lord Voldemort. The movie is packed with action battles, but it did not explain everything i expected it to after reading the book. never the less it was an enjoyable end to the Harry Potter saga. Overall i give the movie 4/5 stars as a few more explanatory science in replace of action would have suited me more. but if you are or arnt a HP fan it is still a must see, i just pray that they are left the way they are and not remade in the future. http://jperusic.blogspot.com/ visit my blog for a more extensive review and of other new movies, polls and film rankings",1
945,10.0,this was a great movie which had some things that needed to be a bit more covered but that's all. If they covered some of these thugs it just would of dragged on a bit to long but some I agree should of been covered. but overall it was a great film with it being intense from beginning to end.... great way to end the series. I have read all the books and the only as well. But a lot of the people complaining on this site is about because of the enormous expectations because of the book. I loved the bit with Molly Weasly and Bellatrix! they kept that well which I was so glad to see because that was one of the reasons I watched it. The ending I was glad they didn't put out to much because I didn't really like the whole corny e ding bit but the only thing I was disappointed with in this entire movie was that you weren't told about Lupins son. but besides that it is a defiantly see as possible movie.,1
946,8.0,"Entertaining? hell yeah!! You cant deny the fact that movie, as such, is very impressive.Alexandre Desplat's composition is outstanding.David Yates' direction is commendable.Would have loved to see Alfonso Cuaron, though. ",1
947,,This movie has literally completed my childhood. ,0
948,,"overall the film is able to eliminate the curiosity of fans of Harry Potter ... but for me personally the last movie is very boring. The plot seemed to jump up and down and in a hurry. Even if allowed comparison with previous films, then I will select a film, Goblet of Fire.",0
949,10.0,"I would have loved to write in capital letters because i really mean what i am going To say. This movie was awesome. The 3d effect made it even better. The Music gave a feeling that this is the end of the movie which i have Watched for years. The trio did very well. The direction was also good. the main thing which i didn't like was the summarization. Being a harry Potter fan i have read the book and believe me it's really long, Satisfying and contains no goofs. The movie changed some parts like in The movie harry breaks the wand whereas in the book he uses it to Repair his old one. The movie was quite fast. Ralph did a great job. The only harry potter movie which can compete with this one is the Chamber of secrets which was as awesome as this one. This movie deserves a blu-ray copy.",1
950,7.0,"My greatest problem with Yates is obviously the battle of Hogwarts. The battle scenes in both Order of the Phoenix and the Half-Blood Prince were disappointing, but I have always been under the impression that this was not so strange because they hadn't enough time to show a decent battle. When I heard DH was split into two parts, immediately I dreamed of a heroic battle of Hogwarts. I thought they would show us everything Rowling described in the book, and so much more - because in a film you can do this. Instead they showed us nothing but two rapid action sequences where the camera flew rapidly over Hogwarts. We didn't see anyone actually dueling, nor did we see the main characters dying. In the book Professor Trelawny fights with crystal balls, and even the centaurs attack in the battle. Did we see any of this happen in the movie? Did we see the battle in the Great Hall? In the book it is described that every character dueled with other characters - George Weasley and Lee Jordan against Yaxley, Flitwick against Dolohov, Hagrid against MacNair, Ron and Neville against Greyback, etc. Did we see any of these duels? Every character that had a role in the first seven movies was asked to return for DH - Part Two. Professor Trelawny, Professor Sprout - they where all on the set. But David Yates didn't think it was necessary to show any of the previous characters fighting or dueling, except one tiny little duel of Mrs. Weasley against Bellatrix. And now we see a huge difference with Lord of the Rings where every minor character gets his role.",1
951,10.0,"Although many people found this movie as their favorite,I was really disappointed in it. I thought unlike the other Harry Potter movies (which were all amazing) I found this one lacking. They cut a lot from the book, and several things were mentioned that unless you read the book you wouldn't understand. Also in the death scenes you have no time to react because the movie already moved on, it felt rushed. Like when Fred, Ron's brother, died Ron cried for a couple minutes then he was fine! Ginny didn't even look like she cared! They also cut out the story of Arianna Dumbledore which was important. I also don't understand David Yates obsession with people crumbling away! Why didn't Bellatrix and Voldemort fall over dead like normal people? Instead they crumbled away or blew up into bits. In my opinion it is the 6th best of 8 the films.",1
952,10.0,"I'm not going to say anything except that I found it quite amazing. Well OK, it wasn't as emotional as the book in some parts, but that doesn't mean i didn't cry. I'm not gonna lie to you. I cried in the movie in many parts and that made me happy. Yes crying for me in a movie means happiness, means that the movie was fantastic, was so emotional!",1
953,,"I probably will rate most of the movies I have watched as 10. The ending of the Harry Potter series was epic, as it was with the book. When Harry met the dead from his past,I felt so touched. The feelings experienced were all different kinds, from excited to terrified. The ending of the first part of the Deathly Hallows left us wondering what will happen in Part 2. I had to beg my parents to watch Part 2 as the release date was near my examinations. The money was well-spent. I loved the music, scenes and emotions displayed by the characters. Might I add that Harry's children are so cute? As of now, I would definitely recommend all Harry Potter fans to buy the CD/DVD. Even if one is a not fan, he or she should try this amazing series.",1
954,10.0,"Wow! This movie was fantastic. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was amazing, really captivating audiences into the most powerful scenes in the film (Courtyard Appacolypse, and the Resurrection Stone scene). The cinematography and visual effects were amazing. Director David Yates and Screenwriter Steve Kloves stepped up their games and really brought the best out of the actors. There were a few things I would've liked to see them include, but overall good job.",1
955,10.0,"Fantastic films, perfect for rewatching, these films never get old. We all grew up watching these films, They still 20 years late are that good. Love the fact new actors were cast so we could all follow their journey. Great popcorn films perfect to binge watch.",1

957,10.0,"The last movie in the Harry Potter series was amazing, from the beginning to the end. The entire cast put on an amazing performance. It seemed like the characters got out of their comfort zone in this movie. For example; Neville when he speaks up instead of being shy! Ron when he finally kisses Hermione! Etc. All characters were portrayed beautifully by the actors and actresses; in particular, Maggie Smith. She was absolutely amazing! Professor Sass! ",1
958,10.0,"The moment i entered the hall it was all ""Harryyy Harryyy "" even more sync and clear than we used to do during the world cup cheering for 'Sachin'.",1
959,10.0,"Ultimate battle between good and evil . A fantasy action drama high on emotion . Awesome visual effects and i love the dragon particularly . Subtle performances by all the cast . The prince tale was pure magic and so was alan rickman .Voldemort was the best thing about the movie which ralph fienns carries menacingly and large amount of badness. The resonating background score helps this movie to achieve the emotional level it wants to .The thing i didn't like about the movie were the death of bellatrix lestrange , the lack of adequate amount of epic action required for a series finale . It pays off the lack of good amount of grand action as in ROTK with an epic proportion of emotion and fantasy . Best movie of the year but may be i an just another potterhead.",1
960,10.0,"Fans who have read the books and/or followed the films will not be disappointed! Okay, it doesn't follow the book step by step, but it captures everything important that is present in the book; this film franchise has definitely ended on a high! If you have been put off by some of the earlier films, which, although I am a Harry Potter fan even I can say weren't great films (those kids really couldn't act!) don't judge this last one on them, it is miles above any previous ones. As always the sets throughout the film create the atmosphere, and the mature cast perform, as you would expect, brilliantly. Even the younger generation of actors have improved leaps and bounds since their Potter debuts 10 years ago. Would recommend you go and see it :)",1

962,10.0,"This was by far the best movie of the series. An epic finale to an epic series, which we grew up together with. The movie is basically concentrated in the battle of Hogwarts and I think it is a decent attempt to transfer the action, the fear, the death, the anxiety and tension of this night. Unlike Part 1, which included scenes and details irrelevant to the story, Part 2 aims to close all unanswered issues explained in previous movies (e.g. Snape's story, Dumbludore's death, Horcuxes ) and it succeeds. Don't' forget that a big part of the audience is people who have not read the books and yet they need to understand what is going on.",1

968,10.0,"The second part of harry potter and the deathly hallows picks up right where the first one left off.<br /><br />Voldemort has the elder wand and is looking for Harry potter, but Harry potter's friends are there to help out Harry in his battle for Hogwarts.",1
969,,"The ten-year wait is finally over. Daniel Radcliff and company shine yet again in Part II of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, an emotionally magical culmination of a generation. At first, the decision of director David Yates to split the last movie into two parts annoyed and confused me. As much as I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters that I feel I have grown very close to, I didn't want to wait for almost a year to see Potter prevail and defeat Voldemort in the final battle. I mean I would have sat through a five-hour feature that I already knew the ending of but I may be in the minority on that one. Actually, that part's probably not true. But, after seeing Part II, I see why Yates prolonged the series—and I am very glad that he did. Obviously, the final installment is all about the ultimate showdown between Harry and Voldemort. After a drawn out, basically action-less Part I, its counterpart was packed with explosive and heart-racing action, emotional turmoil, and ""unexpected"" plot twists from the minute the familiar logo slowly crept onto the screen in time to the unmistakable Harry Potter theme music. Although Part I was great for character development, it was really just used as a stage to prepare for the non-stop epic battle that was Part II. The floodgates of the film opened with the gang trying to steal a horcrux from Gringotts bank. Part humor, part seat-gripping thriller, with a huge dash of special effect, the 2-hour and 10-minute movie-- the shortest of the series-- was as mind blowing as I expected. As with some action movies, battle scenes and special effects can get drawn out to the point of exhaustion and annoyance. I can only watch things blow up in my face and people punching one another for so long. Luckily this was not the case with my beloved Harry Potter. When the fighting, spell casting, and fire breathing dragons got to be almost too much, the characters would be right there, peppering the scene with a subtle yet humorous remark or a deep comment, which helped the viewer stay interested and connected to the plot and the characters. Faithful fans of Harry Potter have been following the trio of friends since the movies hit the big screen in 2000. Many began the journey when JK Rowling released the first book in 1997. Being one of those Potter patrons from before the turn of the century, I feel as if I have grown up with the characters, so to see the whole franchise end as magically as it began was very emotional for me, as well as my fellow movie goers. After seeing all seven movies in the same two theaters—the local theater on Main Street in Ramsey, NJ and at the Garden State Plaza Mall, I had the privilege to see this movie on a random summer Thursday afternoon in Boston with two of my best friends. Not so surprisingly, the crowd that joined us was no different from the crowds I have experienced when viewing every other Potter production. Despite it being 2:30 p.m. in the middle of the week and almost two weeks after the movie was released, the theater was sold out. The crowd ranged from young children to their grandparents, all who remained enraptured the entire time. I expect that everyone was on the edge of their plush, red seats, ignoring their obligatory and over-priced bag of popcorn and large soda as the story unfolded on the large screen. We all gasped at the appropriate moments, laughed at the cleverly delivered wittiness, and all held our breathe at the highly anticipated, ""AVADA KEDAVRA,"" bellowed by Lord Voldemort, striking Harry down in the center of the Forbidden Forest. When the lights slowly rose after the final scene, in which we see Harry, Ron and Hermione, creepily portrayed as adults with children, I had tears in my eyes. Walking out of the theater, I was pathetically crying, realizing that it was actually over. Being the same age as the characters, I have grown up with them and the final movie solidified an end of an era for me, and many others. As sad as I am to have reached the end, I am pleasantly content with how strictly the movie adhered to the book. It tied up every last detail of the whole saga. Now, I just can't wait for it to be released on DVD so I can revisit this epoch anytime I please.",1
970,7.0,"As a huge fan of the books, I was sad and excited to see the final movie in the series.
