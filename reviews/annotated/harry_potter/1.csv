0,,"Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.",1
1,9.0,"Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.",1
2,8.0,"I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It's certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(""OK can we panic now?""). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said ""It's filthy down here,"" the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron's parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1
3,7.0,"The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.",1
4,8.0,"Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.",1
5,10.0,"Not originally a fan of this series (really, not interested), I've got to say that I now see the widespread appeal of these Harry Potter movies! I actually first saw GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) when it premiered on cable the year after it's release and liked it enough to want to start watching this series. Then when ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) came out 2 years later, I liked it, but it seemed to get really dark and serious more so than GoF and I really needed perspective in understanding the trajectory of these HP films. I went out and bought the 5-disc collection of SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZBAKAN, GOBLET OF FIRE, and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. It's apparent these films are purposefully getting darker as they move along, some staying very true to the source material, some taking liberties.",1
6,8.0,"I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.",1
7,8.0,"With all the Character's in place and the world of Hogwarts so well established in the first movie, we get to concentrate more on the story this time around, and consequently, the story is has a little more substance to it.",1
8,8.0,"Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn't get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.",0
9,6.0,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is, unfortunately, not one of the best Harry Potter movies despite (or perhaps because of) sticking relatively closely to J.K. Rowling's original novel (IMHO one of the better in the series). Some parts feel overlong and others too short, and there are signs that director Chris Columbus was growing fatigued in his second (and final) entry in the series.",0
10,,"This movie is way better than the first one, which everyone is saying because--let's face it--it's true. The three leads have grown into their characters, and their acting is loads better. I kept thinking during the first one, ""Aw, look at these cute little kids playing Harry, Ron and Hermione."" Now they ARE Harry, Ron and Hermione, though they still won't get any Oscar nods. All the new characters were absolutely wonderful. I was not disappointed at all with a single one, even Dobby. Now, I know a lot of people compare him to another CGI character, but he's not like that at all. I loved Dobby, even though when I saw him the trailers I thought I was going to hate him. Jason Isaacs as Malfoy was an absolute slime ball, and just so deliciously evil. Not bad looking, either, especially with his luscious long blonde hair. Bonnie Wright returned as Ginny Weasley, who had a much more important part and did an excellent job, I was very impressed. I'm tempted to go on about the lovely Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle, and Kenneth Branaugh, who embodies Gilderoy Lockhart on the screen, but this review has a word limit. Even if you are not a massive Harry Potter fan, you will find this movie very enjoyable. It's scary (spiders, snakes, and willows, oh my!) and incredibly funny, thanks to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and of course Kenneth Branaugh, the incredibly pompous new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Back to the subject of the three leads, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione). They have grown quite a bit since the last film, though it's not a bad thing-Harry and his friends are supposed to grow too. Girls are starting to notice how good-looking Harry has become, and Ron, who is still adorable, and Hermione is becoming very pretty. I was pleased to see that her appearance was more like it was described in the books-she even had big teeth. Ron is finally taller than the other two like he's supposed to be, but that's most likely due to Rupert being older. I only had one disappointment as a major Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff. While I believe he is absolutely dreamy and am in love with him, he just didn't come across as the mad, maniacal Wood we've grown to love. A consolation for some of the die-hard fans who might find the movie a little fast when they first see it-see it twice. The second time is so much more enjoyable, I can't tell you why, but you'll love it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, from the scary gothic kid who sits next to me in fourth period to my work-a-holic father, it's great. I can't wait to see it again with my mother, who was away this weekend. I've already seen it twice, and it's only been out for three days. I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it, even if you didn't like the first one-which I personally find odd, but slightly understandable. Slightly. Go see Chamber of Secrets!",1
11,8.0,"Lessons learned since the 1st film! Clearly this film was edited at script stage rather than the cutting room floor stage!! This story reads as film narrative, rather than a book illustration, which was the big mistake of the 1st film. Anyone can watch this film and follow it without knowing the book. The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.",0

14,8.0,Who would have thought it?  Director Chris Columbus has actually made a very good film!,0
15,7.0,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is more of the same from Chris Columbus, the man who brought the first Harry Potter book to film: dutifully committed to pleasing fans of the book resulting in completely uninspired filmmaking.",0
16,10.0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a huge step on from the first film.  In the Philosophers stone we were introduced to the the world of Harry Potter and given a taster of what lies ahead.  ,1
17,6.0,"The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.",1
18,,"If you liked the first one then you're going to love this!  There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)",1
19,9.0,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon. ,1
20,9.0,"I love how close to the book the film actually is, and the sense of magic and wonder. It's a great children's fairytale.",1
21,9.0,"(I would like to dedicate this review to the late actors Robbie Coltrane and Leslie Phillips who played Hagrid and the Sorting Hat. Those gentlemen were very talented by bringing so much timeless magic to their roles and will never be forgotten. After all, there's no Hogwarts without them. R. I. P.)",0
22,6.0,"This film is the second entry in the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. In terms of box office, it became number 4 of the year 12 years ago. Like the first, it was directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Goonies"", ""Home Alone""), who did not return for film number 3, and written by Steve Kloves based on a Rowling novel. Kloves kept writing for all the films that followed afterward. Just like for Columbus, this was also the last performance for Richard Harris. The actor who portrayed Albus Dumbledore died not much later. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" included some creative inclusions of new characters and story lines, but it also fell flat on developing on some of the parts from the first film. Very early on we are introduced to Gobby, an interesting character and the Potter equivalent to Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"". You could almost say that this film has a message against racism with the victims here being Mudbloods. Fittingly, Malfoy's dad who is also new in the movie has an equally Arian look as his son. The Slytherin house is the one who is against letting Mudbloods (children with magic abilities from non-magic parents) into Hogwarts. At the one scene with the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Kenneth Branagh, one of the more forgettable) and Snape I was wondering why they would support the Potter-Malfoy rivalry by letting them fight against each other. I don't expect good teachers to do that. This film is maybe the one that tells us most about the Malfoy dynasty, also about Hagrid and about the history of the different houses, well actually mostly about Slytherin. Too bad the other houses except that and Gryffindor are rarely mentioned. I bet they have some nice stories too.",1
23,5.0,"The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.",1
24,8.0,"Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies, I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie, but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or Spider-Man. Of course Harry Potter's target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience, but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days. ",1
25,8.0,"It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry despite the pleadings of an imp named Dobby, whom ends up making Harry's foster family hate him more (if such a thing is possible). He has to traverse the Chamber of Secrets to find out who's writing mysterious messages on the school hallways and why people have been petrified. It's up to Harry who has the ability to speak and understand snake talk to save the day. This sequel to an enjoyable little film is better because it can do away with the exposition that the first had to show, and concentrate more on the story, which is deeper and a tad darker than before. I even enjoyed Hermione more in this film, but as is true with the ying and yang, so is true with a hatred of a character in the film, and it's been transfered from Hermione to the awful character of Moaning Myrtle, yea I know she plays an integral part in the plot line of the film, but I still couldn't help but detest her. I think it was her speech patterns that grated on my nerves. That petty nuisance aside, I found this film to be simply captivating from beginning to end.",0
26,7.0,"A lot has been made about the pubescence of the three leads in this new Harry Potter installment and it is a bit disconcerting when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) speak their first lines in those awkward cracks of pre-adolescence.  However, their growing up, along with the physical blossoming of their friend Hermione (the perky and smart actress Emma Watson) seem mark a general growing up of the whole Harry Potter series.  This one is more for grown-ups:  the first one hooked the kid demographic and no doubt they will still be enraptured by ""Chamber of Secrets.""  This is the film, however, that hopes to attract a whole new audience in the parents of those kids.  It is darker and has more layers. The explanations about wizardry are less cursory and the acting seems stronger.",0
27,8.0,"OK, I just finished The Chamber of Secrets, whoo! That was a long movie! But I can understand, these are long books, these movies have a lot to fit into. But I have to say that actually I think I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets a little more than The Sorcerer's Stone. It had more humor and a lot more chilling action sequences. The Chamber of Secrets is a great continue of the sequels to come I'm sure. I loved the new characters, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was my favorite, but I'm a huge fan of Kenneth's, so I think I just am a soft touch for him.",1
28,5.0,"Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director- he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK, if not that terrific, job at it- or in making it about as long as possible (whether or not everything in the book, as someone who's seen the films but not read the books, I can't say, though it feels like they crammed it all), or in making it a wee bit too corny, but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie. It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy. ",0
29,10.0,"This second installment of Harry Potter is also excellent. It has all the exact same great things as the first. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up! I give it 10 out of 10 golden stars.",1
30,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superb, and don't listen to those narrow-minded critics who claim otherwise. Those who said it is superior to the first film are right: Philosopher's Stone was wonderful but the sequel does for Harry Potter what the Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars - elevate it to a higher level where it will be regarded as a masterpiece in it's own right.",1
31,4.0,"One might imagine that because Chris Columbus pulled off a faithful, yet exciting, movie adaptation of the first Harry Potter adventure that he would be able to it a second time. I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not.",1
32,7.0,"The worst of all the Harry Potter movies. This is my opinion about ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. This is the movie of the second book, which is also the weaker of all books written by J.K. Rowlling. I hated some things in the movie that became awful but in the book are exciting:Dolby and the Basilisk for example, are too digital. I like special effects a lot, but they need to be convincing. I mean, in a movie like Shrek,no problem about the reality thing, but in a movie with real people, the Basilisk and Dolby should have other consistence.A sad thing to comment is that Richard Harris, a great actor and also the best Dumbledore, died.",0
33,10.0,"This beast of a film felt like it's writers and directors were drunk children and I love that!!!! The film's childish makers made this film truly magical and a spectacular sight to behold with unlimited creativity, this film has no limits, the characters feel invincible and gives the viewer a great special feeling of being invincible if they were on the sexy island known as Great Britain.",1
34,,"This is undeniably a better film than the last one, which is odd, since it's also undeniable that the second book is the weakest in the series. But perhaps it's not so odd. The first book, after all, is at its best in the opening chapters, in which we, more or less along with Harry, discover that there's a whole world of wizards and witches, that Harry is both talented in magic and an inadvertant celebrity, etc. It was these opening chapters that Coloumbus most thoroughly muffed when he made the screen version. In the first book, nothing that happens at Hogwarts can live up to the promise of the opening; in the first film, the arrival at Hogwarts is a relief after all the dutiful but tedious exposition.",1
35,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is much darker and more insidious in nature than 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  This is not meant as a criticism; indeed, it is partly due to the undercurrent of menace, that this second filmic journey into the wizarding world surpasses its predecessor in terms of quality, enjoyment and heart-in-your-mouth scares.  While it is funny and light-hearted in places, it doesn't gloss over the unpleasant aspects of life, and deals with racism in particular.",1
36,8.0,"A superior sequel and a bonafide winner, this epic children's movie builds on last year's successful formula to offer a film that is even more satisfying than before. Boasting a bigger cast – by retaining the same principal characters and introducing a handful of new ones – better special effects and an intriguing storyline with just the right combination of humour, death, mystery and puzzles, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a delight to watch. Sure, there are problems too numerous to mention. The plot holes and events occurring which are inexplicable to those who haven't read the books are too numerous to mention. Still, at the end of the day, the primary market for this book is the child audience and almost every child should be enchanted by this film. After all, it's a make-believe fantasy in which good always triumphs over evil and the virtues of friendship, kindness, and nobility are promoted over all else, so what is there to complain about? ",0
37,9.0,"'Chamber of Secrets' builds on the intrigue and excitement of the first film in the Harry Potter series - 'The Sorceror's Stone'. It's cool to see the main characters grow and develop in their roles, now in their second year at the Hogwarts School. If anything, this film has even more action and adventure than the first, though for youngsters it might require a bit of caution. There are some unusually harsh and brutal scenes here, like that aggressive tree the boys land in with the magical Weasley car, and the monstrous basilisk that Harry battles near the finale. At nearly three hours, the film doesn't seem to have many slow spots, although the repeat of a quidditch match from the first picture seemed unnecessary for me.",0
38,8.0,"Since the world has already been introduced to the wonderful wizarding world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts, and since all the major characters have all been introduced, what else is there to do to make the other movies special? In the second installment, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all return to their magical school for another year. Somehow, even though they were all placed in a great deal of danger the previous school year, no one expects anything bad might happen. Bad things do happen, and even though the school is host to a staff of enormously competent and powerful wizards and witches, the little children find it's up to them to save the day! It's quite an accomplishment for the three heroes, since there's an army of giant spiders living in the forest, a mysterious villain lurking in the halls who literally petrifies its victims, and a magical diary with its own hidden agenda. Get ready to cut young Harry Potter some slack and keep in mind that he's only twelve years old and liable to make some pretty big mistakes; if you found a talking diary, would you confide in it?",1
39,7.0,"This film essentially begins where its predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" left off with ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) leaving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the summer. Naturally, since his only living relatives weren't very nice to him previously he dreads the thought of spending staying with them. Sure enough, they waste little time in making his life miserable and doing everything they can to prevent him from conversing with his friends or going back to Hogwarts. Then one day he gets a visit from a goblin named ""Dobby"" (voice supplied by Toby Jones) who also does everything he can to prevent him from going back as well-and the reason is more sinister than either of them realize. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this sequel was just as good as the movie before it due in large part to the darker and more intriguing plot. However, like the first film, it does run a bit long (161 minutes) so that might be one consideration for those wishing to watch it. Even so, it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",0

Living in the UK, it's even more popular than in the States, where I first experienced its major influence. The books by J.K. Rowling made ""children read again."" So the next logical course of action is inevitably to make a huge-budget movie adaptation and therefore eliminate all advancements made in literature. What's that? Kids are starting to read again?

We get more world building, more characters and more crazy witchcraft. Problem here is that the primary character introduced is supremely annoying. Branagh is better than Lockhart and this whole performance/character is just obnoxious and one dimensional. From the first second he steps on screen you know what his deal is. We get more danger for our intrepid trio and yet it is becoming painfully apparent that they're not actually in any danger. They survived the first film and it doesn't feel like anything thrown at them here will have any lasting impact.

56,8.0,"I had one problem with the first film, The Sorcerer's stone. The three main characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were irritating.Why would they care about all of this stuff? The kids were only supposed to be eleven in the movie. Why would they care if Snape was a bad guy or that stuff about the Sorcerer's stone? You don't see any other eleven year old playing real life chess. You know why? Because the Potter films are fictional. The sequel to the original, The Chamber of Secrets, is a lot better. Here are the reason why it's better: It's creepier, it's darker, it's funnier, and... the three stars grew up. Daniel Radcliffe definitely did. So did Rupert Grint and Emma Watson and they weren't as irritating. They really don't grow up until The Prisoner of Azkaban. The Chamber of Secrets is actually a disturbing film. There are large spiders, a basilisk, and blood. I won't go into the plot outline for The Chamber of secrets, but I thought I would let you know. This is an improvement on the original film. Like every Potter film, they keep getting better and better. They continue to get darker and darker. Here is my entire theory on the Potter films. The Darker, the better. That's what makes this film better than The Sorcerer's stone.",0

61,,"Warning to those who are avid fans of J.K. Rowling--I LOATHE the Harry Potter books.  Yes, I have read them.  I find her writing to be more than a little plagiaristic of the style of C.S. Lewis, but without the skill that he employed.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed both this and the first movie.  Frankly, I don't care if the scriptwriters left this bit or that bit out; it is simply impossible for all parts of any novel to be completely included in a film without turning it into an epic of a minimum of seven hours, which is ridiculous.  That is the nature of a film; much over two-and-a-half hours and the theatres are only going to be able to show a limited number of screenings, which will, of necessity, limit the profit to be made on the film--and the bottom line of any film project is ""How much of a profit will it make?"".

I had to run out myself once, cursing, just when they were about to ""follow the spiders""...)",0

Sometimes it's number 1, but I always juggle it along with Jurassic Park and Empire Strikes Back. To put it simply, everything is right with this movie.",1
64,7.0,"Here's round two of the adventures of young wizard Harry Potter and friends. While not a terrible movie, this one is probably my least favorite and the most forgettable. It's more faithful than the previous film, but that's not entirely a good thing, as this one really drags, and, at this point, it's not quite necessary yet since the books didn't start getting really detailed, ambitious, and overblown until part 4. Columbus returns as director, and this time we follow 12 year-old Harry going through his second year of schooling. As if rival students, menacing teachers, and loads of schoolwork weren't enough, things start getting dire at school when people are found petrified like statues, threats are written on walls in blood, and a monster is on the loose. Even a gifted wizard like Harry may have some serious trouble coping. I can appreciate that they were trying to be more faithful to the book, but they might have been too faithful. It's my least favorite entry, and, while it's not boring, it's just not gripping enough, I feel, to warrant a film of such length. At least the film is good about balancing the tone fairly well. All the actors are fine, and they are only getting better and more comfortable with the characters with each new entry. Harris made his swan song here as Dumbledore, but his replacement in part 3 takes up the mantle with ease. All in all, a decent movie, but like I said, probably my least favorite.",0

67,5.0,"I really liked the first Potter film and I was disappointed by the second Potter film. The thing I was let down by was the film's sheer overlength. At 161 minutes, the film is overlong and lacking the emotional sweep needed to make up for it. Director Chris Columbus uses the same techniques as his first film but this time the results appear clichéd and stale. It does not have the same powerful impact it had the first time. I enjoy watching such talented actors at work however and the filmmakers stay true to their subject matter and do not abandon the charm of J.K Rowling's now classic characters. Yet when it comes down to it, it is a disappointment and lacks the sweeping sense of freshness of the first.",0
68,,"Just what is it about ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" that makes it so bland, so uninteresting?  I walked into the cinema on Friday night feeling a certain trepidation about the new HP film.  As one of the few remaining people on the planet who has never read an HP book, I wondered if spending the next two and a half hours in the company of Griffindellstumblebumhumblepiebumblebeepainintheass was really a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  It was not long before I had my answer.  No, it was not a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  As seemingly intelligent adults all around me cracked up at the hilarious antics of Valdemort and Fiddlededee and Sultanabran, I began to feel very uncomfortable indeed. Perhaps a pillow and a cup of cocoa would have helped.  Cinema seats are not designed for the sleepy.  To keep me awake, there staggered across the screen a succession of much-loved British character actors.  Oh, look, it's Julie Walters.  And that bloke from ""The Fast Show"".  And, oh, how lovely, it's cuddly Kenneth Branagh.  Marvellous.  Meanwhile our three heroes are proving, once and for all, that they cannot act.  The dolt who plays Harry has two expressions: ""I'm grinning"" and, ""I'm trying not to grin"".  The one who plays the other boy has one expression: ""I'm going to be sick"".  The girl has several, and is reasonably talented, but even she looks bored in this, and possibly very annoyed that she spends the second half of the film in a coma.  The plot, such as it is, can be summed up as follows: a succession of events occurs at the magical school of Hogwarts, or whatever the heck it's called.  HP sorts everything out.  The end.  The action (and I use the term very loosely indeed) is dull and plodding.  The special effects are bland and lifeless.  Each scene has no relation to the one before or after it.  The ""climax"", when it eventually arrives, is no more or less exciting than any other scene that has gone before it.  The entire film feels like it's been put together at random - some spiders here, a snake here, a flying car here, blah blah blah.  There is nothing magical or enchanting about this film.  It is dull and inane.  The only genuinely amusing moment comes when the boy who is not HP says, after the spider sequence, something along the lines of, ""What was the point of that, then?"" It's a very good question.  The scene (which probably cost twice as much as the whole of ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Ghost World"") has no reason to exist.  It serves no purpose.  It's not even scary. The entire film is two and a half hours of nothing at all.  And don't get me started on Quidditch.  As in HP1, the scene involving this pointless sport looks like it has come from an entirely different film.  The lighting is all wrong (being entirely computer-generated, this is not surprising, I suppose) and it jars with the rest of the movie. Two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back.  You'd think, after LOTR, TPM, AOTC and Spider bloody Man, that I'd have learned my lesson, wouldn't you?  Oh well.  If I can spare you the horror of this tedious drivel, then those two and a half hours will not have been totally wasted.",0
69,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a wonderful movie, just as good as the first. The acting I have to say was much better. Some parts were left out but it followed the book way more than the first one did. The actors that were choosen for this movie worked very well and Kenneth Branagh did a wonderful job as Gilderoy Lockhart. The only problem I had with it is that it was a little slow. It took awhile for somethings to get moving but that is alright. Everything just worked very well and the music was wonderful, just as good as the first. Over all I would give this movie an A+++ and for those who didn't like it (I don't tell people how to controll their opinions but...) your crazy. No it's ok not everyone has to like it.

The fan-base is so broad and so eager that people would walk through fire to see the films. In the case of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, the makers have too often been lazy because they're already guaranteed an audience.

Child actors are a little older (and better) in this movie, the atmosphere is really magical and adult actors as great as always and I don't even have to say anything about the score. This one is probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series. Effects look a bit fake at some parts but aside from that, everything was perfect. When I saw the first movie after reading a book, I liked it, but it felt kinda rushed. In this one, everything was great. It had all plot elements from the book (I think), it was darker, more thrilling but this one may scare the children a little (boo, spiders!). From new actors in the series, I was overwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh as a new arrogant professor Gilderoy Lockhart and some of his scenes still make me laugh out load.

Stories of witches and magic and supernatural powers and beings have cluttered literature since the days of Greek mythology, and people simply looked at it either as the remains of an ancient culture, a piece of art from a creative mind or a reminder of the many worlds out there which we know nothing about. In reading claims that the ""Harry Potter"" books and films open up the minds of children to magic, black or white and is a Pied Piper journey towards evil, I had to remind myself that as far as I can see, it's only a piece of fiction, that children have wild imaginations, and that as long as they are made aware that it is indeed, pure fiction, no evil can come from reading books or watching the films. If there are hidden messages there, they are way hidden beneath the theme that evil is always destroyed by good, that monsters of all sorts are conquered, and that children can be influenced to help others in times of crisis, something everybody in life needs to be prepared for.",1

I obnoxiously considered myself not to be a part of the target audience (too old and anti-computer generated effects), even though the copious fantasy & horror ingredients always somewhat triggered my curiosity. I literally waited until this second installment in the series was programmed on national television and I was too lazy to switch the channel. It didn't take too long before I regretted having waited this long, as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a vastly entertaining and impressively accomplished blockbuster. Obviously I can't compare it to anything else, as I haven't seen any of the other films and never even held one of J.K. Rowling's books in my hands, but you don't need comparison in order to know this is excellent fun to enjoy with a big pack of popcorn. According to most reviewing people around here, this second film is already a lot darker and more sinister than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and apparently the series gradually grew more mature. Me, I was already quite astounded with the amount and types of morbidity featuring in this. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is child-friendly, but definitely not childish. Of course there aren't any explicit death sequences shown on screen, but there's loads of creepy stuff (giant spiders, snake-monsters, spontaneously combusting birds, ) that I imagine can be quite nightmarish.

The best part about the movie was Dobby. Dobby looked very real, and he was just like what was described in the book.  But, I guess the books just don't make great movies because there are so many great characters and side plots in the books that you can't put in a movie because of time restraints.  The movie is nearly 3 hours, but it just seems rather boring because they try to include as much from the book as they can, so it feels like a lot of scenes are cut short.

According to what I have heard, the books are loaded with great dialogue and sarcastic and witty commentary.  Both films were devoid of those aspects.  Some found the films funny and I didn't find them such.  The plot could have been written too fit an hour and a half as opposed to one and a half days.  The subject of witchcraft is not one that entices me either.

Those who were exposed in the first movie are now developed and a part of the pattern Harry and his pals share. Hogwarts and environs becomes even more amazing and puzzling. The long shots, especially, are so very creative. We find out as each movie comes along that Harry is fallible and must face his fears without much help. This leads to a real empathy with him. There are so many superheroes frequenting the movies these days. Many are pretty tiresome. Their stories lack character. Harry, of course, is a wizard, but he is always becoming.

It is there that Harry is reunited with Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Hermoine (Emma Watson) and unfortunately the mean Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), with his father Lucous (Jason Isaacs). When they get back to Hogwarts, with getting through Platform 9 and 3 quarters and using the blue car, and after being told off, the lessons soon continue again. Teachers include Professor Pomona Sprout (Miriam Margolyes) teaching magic plant handling, and new teacher of The Dark Arts, who Harry met in Diagon Alley, the ""famous"" Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh). The second Quidditch game is good because Malfoy is against Harry as the new seeker. Later, terrifying things are happening to people, they are being petrified by something, and in a lesson with Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) she explains about the note left on the wall, i.e. about the Chamber of Secrets. Later, Harry finds a diary belonging to someone called Tom Riddle, and through this magical book he sees a vision about who may be responsible, Hagrid! Oh, and Harry also finds out he can talk Parceltongue, like a Slytherin student, which comes in handy when they go looking for the beast petrifying everyone, the Basilisk. The Basilisk brings death to someone if they look in its eyes, it's only petrified those people because they didn't look at directly, i.e. reflections or through a ghost. Harry, Ron and Lockhart, who they found out stole all his stories from other wizards, erasing their memory, anyway they find the bathroom with the entrance to the chamber, and where Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) was killed by the beast, and Harry battles the blinded (by the phoenix) Basilisk, and Tom Marvolo Riddle (Christian Coulson, his name is mixed from the words I Am Lord Voldermort). The film ends happily with Hermoine and the other victims revived from being petrifying, Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris, in his last film before dying) returns from Azkaban prison (faulsly arrested), and Hagrid is applauded when Harry makes him one of the big helps.

Obviously watching the extended version didn't help but... god it just doesn't flow well. The action doesn't even come in especially well until 100 minutes in by then I was just bored. I can see why it's the lowest rated of the series and I have to agree. I was surprised by the fact I was struggling between a 5 and a 6. I really didn't like it that much this time around.",0

123,5.0,"This movie is difficult for me to rate. On one hand, it remains faithful to the book. On the other hand, despite being well-acted, with some good use of CGI, the Chamber of Secrets is often frustratingly dull and never really picks up until the final fight scene but then the movie slides back down into dullness again.",0

125,10.0,"So yeah...my summary pretty much says it all.  I love this movie, I love the first movie, I LOVE the books...yeah some might argue that the books are better, but duh!!! of course the books are better, the book is pretty much always better than the movie, but regardless this is an amazing movie.  It has a wonderful story, wonderful characters, great action sequences, and good humour to balance it all out.  I've heard a lot of arguments for the actors playing the trio being too old for the parts, but I think people fail to realise that the characters age as well, not to mention the fact that in most movies/tv shows there are much older people playng ""teens"", so for Emma, Daniel, Tom, and Rupert I don't think that there age difference is really that big, but I digress.  This movie is fun and exciting, it crosses age groups (seeing as how when I first saw it I was 22, my mum was 60, and my neice was 8...and we all loved it)I can't wait till June '04 to see the next exciting installment :)",1
126,,"It's startling how such a marvellous movie series can have on such an aberration, especially considering how it comes from the same director that made Philosopher's Stone such a wonderful and rewatchable family film. Chamber of Secrets in contrast won't please either of the family members: the kids are only going to be disturbed by the violence and intensity in it, while the adults are likely to laugh at how ridiculous these particular scenes are made. Why not pursue the darker, grittier style the way every sequel after this one did, especially when the subject has moments as terrifying for young children as Chamber of Secrets has. But enough of that because the false approach and the shocking PG rating (both in the UK and the US) aren't the reason this film has disappointed me as heavily as it did. Maybe it was the missing break between shooting the first and the second film of the Harry Potter series that made Chris Columbus and his crew lose most about what was so great about Philosopher's Stone and replace with silly physical humour and sloppy screen writing. What has to be said out of fairness as well is that the novel it is based on is as well the weakest in the series, with the introduction of the three most annoying characters in the Harry Potter universe: Dobby, Colin Creevey and Gilderoy Lockhart. Miraculously, as the cast chiefly stayed the same, all the actors gave a worse performance in Chamber of Secrets, most of all the child actors that now simply must have felt overstrained. Additionally, the CGI was lousy and everything entertaining about it has been there in Philosopher's Stone already. Granted, I still enjoyed the cinematography, set design, and score, and Hogwarts hasn't lost its magical atmosphere in Chamber of Secrets, but the fact that this isn't a good film is defined by just one simply statement: there was not one scene in the film that I really enjoyed. And that says an awful lot about what is actually my favourite film series.",0
127,5.0,The second outing for Harry Potter. After spending the summer back with his guardians Harry is finally summoned for the second year at Hogwarts. This is slightly darker than the original and shows us what to expect during the next few years.,1
128,5.0,This is not the Harry Potter of the first sequel.  The story is weak and the actors just do not believe what they say. You feel that they feel sure that nothing can happen anymore: the movie is going to be a success anyway. The fencing has been shot without any form of imagination and the sky-soccer match is flaw and has nothing of the surprises of the first movie. I wanted to leave the theatre and I said in myself: this has no point to watch until the end. I will see the movie anyway with the kids on dvd. Will they enjoy it? I remained until the end and said in myself: what a long movie!,0

This film is a $100 million dollar Saturday morning cartoon.",0

(1) The adapted screenplay of Steven Kloves.  The adaptation stayed faithful to JK Rowling's novel. (2) The rather skin-crawling performance of Jason Isaacs.  I think this was his best role since ""The Patriot"" and the best supporting role in the film. (3) The film had excellent plotting.  I was in awe at several unexpected twists the film took. (4) England's A-List reappeared again.  Kenneth Branagh did really well as the self-centered Gilderoy Lockhart. (5) The art direction is still some of the best out there.

Judging from the laughter at unfunny things and the telegraphing of key moments by the audience's gasps before anything had happened on screen, not many in the theatre were new to Potter. Because I have not read  more than a page of any Harry Potter book or ever seen any portion of a movie I had the advantage of looking at this boring movie with an unbiased eye. The story is inane and silly, full of cliches and standard scenes. The acting is dull. There is not actually one believable character in the whole movie.  As if this isn't bad enough, the movie goes on endlessly.  Apparently if you're a Potter fan there is no limit to your stomach for it.  Enough said.",0

143,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Kenneth Branaugh, Richard Harris: Every bit as enchanting and visually breathtaking as The Sorcerer's Stone. Filled with spectacular detail of massive serpents, gigantic spiders, humungous trees, a flying car, and a bright orange bird of great significance. The Chamber of Secrets is somewhat a reference to Harry who inhabits an ability to understand a language spoken by snakes. Tragedy strikes when bodies are found frozen in shock. Witchcraft is not for children, but Harry conquers a massive foe using practical means. Solid plotting filled with wonder and surprise with director Chris Columbus returning to deliver greater magic. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry whom must face this disturbing new ability plus face a greater monster. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return as Ron and Hermione whom assist Harry in his quests. Kenneth Branaugh is a splendid new addition as a flamboyant teacher who presents magic from a situational standpoint but by and large he provides comic relief and a cowardly disposition. Richard Harris returns for the final time as Dumbledore, who is the most power wizard and heads the school. While better than the first film, it is still pointless fun but discernment advised before children view its secrets. Score: 8 / 10",1
144,9.0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time with my daughter. The storyline follows Harry returning to a darker Hogwarts. There is a plague threatening the school that is leaving students paralyzed. Many believe it is because of a old curse inside a room within the school. Due to a pure blood wizard being part of the school for the first time in decades the room is now open and something has come out. Harry and friends will research the details of the old story of how the room came to be and try to save the school from whatever has come out...,1
145,8.0,"The Harry Potter film series is an interesting exception to the oft-quoted ""rule"" that sequels are never as good as the original films and that the more sequels a franchise spawns the worse they become. Most film sequels are ad hoc affairs; a film does well, so a team of scriptwriters are hired to cobble together another screenplay based around further adventures involving the same characters. The Potter series, however, is different; it is based upon a series of novels which were in themselves conceived not as isolated stories but as episodes in one greater story. It is, therefore, not surprising that the series has not succumbed to the sort of slapdash writing and money-grubbing cynicism which mark the later episodes of certain film franchises.",0
146,,"When Prof. Dumbledore tells Harry Potter it's not ability that counts but the choices we make, I knew this series had to be more than magical cliffhangers strung together by 3 cute British private school chums.

147,8.0,The best movie I've ever seen really I love it definitely deserves a better vote,1
148,9.0,"'Harry Potter And The Chamber Of The Secrets (2002)' has aged better than the first, the young actors now more confident and comfortable in their roles, and it also dips into darker territory as it expands the universe in exciting new ways. Once the well-paced main plot gets underway, the action sequences are entertaining and tense while the quieter moments allow for some decent character building and subtle set-up for later instalments. It's more entertaining than its predecessor and it's even more efficient, despite being longer. The fairly lengthy run-time flies by. Plus, Kenneth Branagh is a real treat. For me, this is the definitive 'Potter' picture. 9/10",1
149,1.0,"I watched this movie in Bavaria and was shocked that this movie was rated as suitable for 6 years old children! This movie is certainly not suitable for 6 years old children and frankly I wouldn't let my 10 years old children watch this pile of brutal and morbid trash. It's too loud, too fast and too brutal and morbid. Some scenes are really frightening and seem to be lifted directly from horror movies like the scene with the giant spiders. And such scenes where the ghost of this girl is asked ""How was dying?"" are quite sick, especially in a movie for children. Add some blood on the walls etc. and you have this movie. But from a director like Chris Columbus what else was to expect? I don't know the book and I really don't care about it and its writer who seems to be only interested in making money. Also this movie has no meaning, no message and is therefore as a movie for children a real waste of time (and money). But it was great to see such great actors as Maggie Smith and Richard Harris again. But I hated this little girl Hermine, she was such a know-it-all! I also think it's quite ignorant that the scenes containing writing in English weren't redone for the other language versions. If you want to see a real good movie for children, that has a message, go and see ""The Last Unicorn"" by Rankin/Bass.",0

While a bit over the top, it was a nice touch to add the elements of an aristocracy seeking racial purity in the second installment, for what could be more evil than that, and Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Tom Felton (Draco) were perfectly cast. I also liked seeing the beginnings of the mysterious link between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, and the story here is a good one. There are several aspects in Rowling's book that seem pulled from a variety of sources, but she combined it all in an entertaining way, and this is a fun watch.",1

From this scene on, you will know this will be an magical and adventurous movie filled with surprises and spells. Harry ends up back at the school, despite warnings not to return, and hears mysterious voices from inside the school's walls. He also learns that muggle-born students (students born from humans, not witches) are being attacked and soon everybody discovers that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. What follows is a daring mission to discover the Chamber and to solve the ongoing crises. ",1
154,7.0,"This is actually a good adaptation from novel to movie. It has just about every part in the book although it lacks a bit of the satire, the execution of the movie seemed way more better this time. It seemed like a actual movie instead of a high budget live Saturday morning show for kids. It seemed like a actual movie instead of looking cheap and lame like the previous movie. Also was able to watch this from one sitting. The big budget is used well in this, especially when it comes to the special effects for 2002. Also all the good parts in the book is in this movie, in fact this stays flawlessly with the novel all the way too the end. Which is great, so overall it's a faithful adaptation. However the acting seemed to have gotten worse at times, especially the person that plays Harry Potter. If your a fan of the novel there is a high chance you will probably like this sequel.",0
155,8.0,"The second in the Harry Potter series was described as better than the first. I do not really agree with this. The 'Chamber' is a good movie, but there is no really anything new and the magic of the first film is already too well known and repeated here to be efficient. The only new funny character is the computerized servant, which I really expect to develop in the next series. Otherwise, the film is well done, well acted but too much the same. I really wonder if the young ones who are supposed to be a big percentage of the public can really enjoy the movie - some parts are too scary, and the 161 minutes are a challenge for young ages.",1
156,,"Once again, the fantastic production design almost fools you (and does fool many people) into thinking that you are watching a good movie. But it doesn't hold up in the end, as the completely non-heroic ""hero"" Harry Potter is led by the nose through another predictable mystery in the mechanical, eliteist Hogwarts. A lot of respected actors try very hard to appear quirky and compelling, but in the end this story has little interest and the film has no heart or soul.",1

In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty  as well as the wit - that came with the getting-to-know-you opening section of `Sorcerer's Stone.'  As compensation, `Chamber of Secrets' offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery.",0

So, it's not surprising that Columbus has repeated here the success of the first movie of the franchise. It's also not surprising that there are obvious similarities between the two films, which ultimately distinguish them from the other films that would follow after Columbus departure. Another name that will disappear from the franchise after this film is Richard Harris, who played the role of Albus Dumbledore, one of the most important in the saga, as Harris dies that same year.

It's a magical adventure that takes us back to Hogwarts with Harry in his second year, with darker elements being explored, the history and landscape of the school is expanded from our very own eyes, we discover in this movie just how large and innovative this universe truly is. It's certainly not as enjoyable as its predecessor, the Philospher's Stone, was, though I like the darker themes, I felt as if it didn't gradually become more bleak, we went from the fun laid back atmosphere of the first movie, to a much more severe and complicated one here, I was disappointed with the lack of development from Hermione in this film, though Harry and Ron's character arch is further established fantastically here, Hermione isn't in it enough and her character is basically the exact same at the end of this as she was in the previous movie. There are plenty of great new characters here as well that further shows us what this universe is capable of, Dobby the House Elf, Lucius Malfoy and Gilderoy Lockhart, among many others, and terrific characters that are superbly portrayed by their actors, and they all add more depth to this amazing universe.

169,10.0,"This is for me the best of the series and it goes as well for the book, the game and the movie. It's the quintessential Potter spirit because it has all the goof things I look for: the school year, the wizardry, the friendship and the mystery. I remember the first time I saw it: it was during a Wednesday baby-sitting of the son of a good friend: He was 6 then and we kept playing the scene when the Spider comes up at the car's window. It's true that the production is less baroque (cheaper?) than the later movies but at last, the young trio is still well coached and the visual stays very realistic even if it's about an imaginary universe. If Hermione takes a health leave, Ginny makes a brilliant substitute and it's funny to see that she has always been this same quiet, shy girl. But this movie counts for me because it's the last of the real Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect choice: his weary voice (a bit like Pacino) and his aura makes him a very warm grandfather and a respected headmaster. Gambon never gets into the robe and it's a pity that Mr. Harris couldn't follow the adventure.",1

In this film we see a development of two major characters in Dumbeldore & Tom Riddle(Voldemort).

Harry starts to face his true demon in this film with Voldemort playing even more powerful mind games. We still do not see Voldemort in the flesh however his presence as the character is widely seen through Harry's character. Watch for the wand duel between Malfoy & Harry when Harry speaks parcel tongue, this scene is very intriguing & an interesting part of the story. More gruesome than the first film & possibly better, this Potter sequel is brilliant. Kenneth Branagh steals the show as the new professor & is very funny however Jason Issacs is ideal as the evil yet prestigious Luscious Malfoy.",1

Director Chris Columbus and his crew operate much more like a team that's been here before, that knows the fantasy world it has created and how to make it better.

But, most importantly, it does preserve the light-hearted sense of humor and childlike buoyancy that made the first film entertaining. The humor is slightly on the mawkish side this time, and Columbus hasn't decided against tacking on another winning-is-good wrap-up, this time even more peppered with honey-baked schmaltz than last time, but the light-hearted youthful nature of the material is still intact and keeps it engaging even for those of us who haven't seen it in nearly ten years.",1

Before the start of his second year, Harry is visited by a House Elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but of course Harry doesn't heed his warning. Besides, he must escape from the clutches of his cruel, nasty adoptive family.",1
183,10.0,"The first movie was the setup, and this one is the payoff. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" leaves all of the explanations of wizardry behind and plunges quickly into an adventure that's darker and scarier than anything in the first Harry Potter movie. It's also richer: The second in a planned series of seven Potter films is brimming with invention and new ideas, and its Hogwarts School seems to expand and deepen before our very eyes into a world large enough to conceal unguessable secrets. In the new movie, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, a little taller and deeper-voiced) returns with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, in the early stages of babehood). They sometimes seem to stand alone amid the alarming mysteries of Hogwarts, where even the teachers, even the august headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even the learned professors Snape (Alan Rickman) and McGonagall (Maggie Smith), even the stalwart Hagrid the Giant (Robbie Coltrane) seem mystified and a little frightened by the school's dread secrets. The conceited new faculty member, deliciously cast, is Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), author of the autobiography Magical Me, who thinks of himself as a consummate magician but whose spell to heal Harry's broken arm has unfortunate results. And then there is Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), father of the supercilious Draco, who skulks about as if he should be hated just on general principles. These characters and plot elements draw together in late action sequences of genuine power, which may be too intense for younger viewers. There is a most alarming confrontation with spiders and a scary late duel with a dragon, and these are handled not as jolly family movie episodes, but with the excitement of a mainstream thriller. While I am usually in despair when a movie abandons its plot for a third act given over entirely to action, I have no problem with the way ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" ends, because it has been pointing toward this ending, hinting about it, preparing us for it, all the way through. What a glorious movie.",1
184,8.0,"I just finished watching all the Harry Potter films back to back to back to back. What a crazy trip. Before starting this review, here is my ranking, from best to worst:",0
185,7.0,The Chamber of Secrets is a decent film and a stronger film than its predecessor. From the start we are captured by the mystery and intrigue surrounding the Chamber and the story behind it. We are also treated to an amusing start with Harry and Ron trying to make their way to Hogwarts. Part of the charm of Harry Potter and making him relatable is his down to earth character and nature.,0
186,1.0,"I hated this movie. I'm sorry if that bothers anyone, but that is my opinion. No, I have not read any of the books, nor will I ever, but that should have no bearing on the quality of the movie; in other words, if I have to like the book to like the movie, then this is simply a movie for fans, nothing more.",0
187,9.0,"Classic and equally great second part to the Saga, definitely a must watch for fans of the book, even if some details had to be changed for the sake of the big screen. Definitely a perfect sequel as all films in the saga are. And they only get better with age.",1
188,7.0,"While I despised the first Harry Potter movie, this one proved to be much more engaging and better made than its predecessor. The kids obviously look more polished in this film, having actually learned something from the rather pitiful Chris Columbus. For posterity's sake, I'll give this film a 7/10 merely fro the fact that the special effects didn't look tacked on and the performances were much more grounded and realistic. All I can though, is we need more of the Weasleys! Just looking at them as a family is a hoot! Oh well, I'm rambling.",0
189,8.0,Second part of Harry Potter franchise and in my top 3 Harry Potter movies. Great sequel to another school year of magical trio which is full of adventures. This was very scary one when I watched it as kid but now it's not that scary but it has some spooky moments. Doby is a free elf!,1
190,,"I have seen the first film and I feel the same about this one.  Not really a lot to it.  Just another movie to watch as far as I'm concerned.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that great either.  I find myself saying the same thing about this movie that I said about the last.  It's just way too Disney for me.  I am not saying I am not looking forward to the next movie, because I am.  My feeling is the context of the film seems to drag on, and instead of being really excited of what might happen next, I find myself not being surprised at what happens at all.  I still like the overall look of the film, the actors are good, the direction and the special effects are good, but, I am only just okay with this whole genre of films.  I give it a 5 out of 10.  Maybe renting it would be an even better idea.",0

The potential of the stories of the orphaned wizard was huge success and the Philosopher's Stone was only ratified sure the executives at Warner. A year later, hit the screens the adventures of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry, director Chris Columbus bringing the original cast back and incremented other big names known to the general public.",0

194,,"Harry is now in his second year at Hogwarts in this welcome return to witchcraft and wizardry. As the eponymous hero, Daniel Radcliffe is now a rather taller, but more assured, 13 (by a magical coincidence, he shares a birthday - 31 July - with Harry himself and creator J K Rowling). Most of the characters from the first film are back, but new ones include engaging Kenneth Branagh as the charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart and the voice of Toby Jones as the (computer generated) house elf Dobby (who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Gollum in ""Lords Of The Rings 2"" issued about the same time).

197,8.0,"*For all of you who haven't read the book, I suggest you stop reading now. Spoilers ahead*",0
198,6.0,"The books by J. K. Rowling narrating Harry Potter's saga are indeed the product of a powerful creative imagination and an original one into the bargain. She creates an universe that lives entirely in her head around a school of wizards that is described in all its details, rules, habits and characters whatever odd or strange they may be making it to appear as real. The atmosphere of the school situates itself in an old mansion or castle or palace which lends it a Gothic atmosphere that adds mystery to the stories involved. This movie follows faithfully these features without losing its aesthetic autonomy as a movie (which is an art other than literature) translating the most thrilling moments of the book by effective visual effects. The fantastic scenes which we see, however, are not more thrilling than others shown on other fantastic movies. And of course we cannot forget this is a movie for children or teen-agers therefore we adults must forget our own values while watching it. Nevertheless, as usual, the general subject is the fight between Good and Evil which always ends with the latter's defeat though only temporary because in the following movie of the series that fight is resumed again. A good movie to entertain and amuse and nothing more.",1
199,2.0,"Inferior to the first film in many respects except for action. Unfortunately there is very little character development and the film focuses itself on a tortured, twisted plot. Puberty has not been kind to the actors, especially Harry, who now speaks in a very deep voice. ",0

Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on his/her guard - ""The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware"".",0
201,10.0,"On the Internet, someone felt this was the worst movie in the series? It's one of the best and a bit easier to follow than some later entries. One surprise after another. So much going on here: The Weasley's flying British Ford with an attitude, the Whomping Willow Tree, ominous messages written in blood, Moaning Myrtle, a pompous professor, a wand duel between Draco and Harry. R.K. Rowling wisely ""allows"" Ginny to only petrify and not kill Hogwart students. The ""Riddle"" of Tom Riddle. The amazing and funny Mandrake potting class. The monster that gives me chills even on the small(er) TV screen: The ancient giant Parsal-snake, with the Medusea-like power to kill on direct sight, and huge appetite! Stunningly complex backgrounds and sets. The ingenious use of the Phoenix-Bird, Sorting Hat, and the Sword of Griffindor to save everyone; as Harry is saved from certain death by the restoring power of the Phoenix tears. One of the longest movies in the series, but almost as good as the first one!",0
202,7.0,"Of course the Harry Potter books are out of this world. The movie has tried to reach the standards of the book, which is impossible to achieve I guess. Overall worth a watch, but I won't watch it again (while I've read the books a million times). Love Hermione! Just exemplary the way Voldemort appeared in this second part of the saga. I love how we slowly get a feel of his evilness, till the actual wizard regains power.",1
203,7.0,I loved this sequel more than the first one idk why but I hate the fact that some times it is like target for children,1
204,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another good movie in the series and picks right up off of the first. I don't personally think it had the same magical feel to it as the first but it is still very good. They do a really good job bringing the story to life and making you feel enchanted throughout. The quality also seems to be getting better after the first one and only increase as the series gets more steam. I do think this movie is more of a ""filler"" movie and not one of the absolute pillars of the series like others are. But nonetheless, a great movie and part of one of the best series ever.",1
205,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a sequel that managed to be even better than the original, with a sequel you don't have to worry about the origin anymore and you can just show the characters in their prime being awesome, and this film understood that.",0
206,3.0,"There's so much to say about The Chamber of Secrets, so let's say the story is even duller than the first film. And the chief reasoning for calling the film dull is because of how flat and tedious it was. If only it was more entertaining and if they didn't save all the excitement for the climatic point, it probably could've been a lot better. The fantastical elements are obviously totally uninteresting, but what audiences are looking for is a diverting tale, which we didn't get.",0
207,10.0,"Whoever read my review for the first film (and probably hate me for writing it), well hope Ive redeemed myself with this review. ",0
208,,"Fans of novelist J.K. Rowling publishing juggernaut will be happy to know that the events from the book are faithfully replicated for the screen,but in my honest opinion perhaps too much so for those who might enjoy a little interpretative license. This is particularly the case with this latest installment which looks like a version of a pre-Spielburg  sequel to can we say here,Harry Potter and the Temple of Doom? For one, director Chris Columbus has channeled into the essence of the books to a tee according to the standards of novelist J.K. Rowling. but unlike the first installment the title character here(played by Daniel Radcliffe) is very dull and boring and loses the audiences attention very quickly. The rest of the actors here are absoultely brilliant as played by Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Kenneth Branaugh(doing a delicious turn as a pompous celebrity wizard),Jason Issacs(as the evil nemesis Lord Voldemort is wicked),Robbie Coltrane,Alan Rickman,Maggie Smith,and the late Richard Harris as Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Elsewhere,Columbus does a nice job at the special effects especially with the Quidditch scene is a marvel to behold and the climactic scenes(who have some darker moments) are frightening and superbly done to a shine. As for the acting here for some,its need a little improvement especially with Radcliffe who was brilliant in the first one,but slack off in this installment. Still needs more work to do,and for one this one runs way too long(at over two hours) and this may bore some children under the age of 12 but still has a ""PG"" rating.",0
209,,"An incredible turnaround from the first outing. Being unshakeably of the opinion that despite so many other shortcomings, Daniel Radcliffe single handedly sank the first movie with his total lack of charisma, acting ability and screen presence, I'm here to tell you that somehow - whether through an intense acting course or by virtue of perhaps, Columbus' positive influence - Radcliffe has come up with a total make-over. He IS Harry Potter now! As well as moving up to warp factor 5 on the acting scale...he is moving and presenting well...dammit, the lad was just plain excellent here!",1
210,8.0,"This movie is darker and creepier than the first installment, and has good action and humor too. Once again, the 3 main child actors do wonderfully and this has a very emotionally uplifting ending as well with Hagrid and Hermione returning (plus the awesome, eerie confrontation and exchange between Harry and Tom Riddle that gets you even more invested in the evil of this universe). The introduction of Lucius Malfoy was handled very well (performed wonderfully by Jason Isaacs) and the actor who plays Draco does his job once again! Dobby is annoying at first but becomes a character with good depth!! The scene with the spiders is very creepy and impressive with visually convincing special effects (throughout the film too). Lastly, RIP to Richard Harris, he had fantastic Dumbledore moments in his last movie!",1
211,,"The new craze in fantasy movies is to have lovable CG characters such as Jar Jar Binks, Yoda, Gollum and now.......DOBBY.  Yes, Dobby was a highlight of this wonderful adaptation of J.K.'s book.  I finished reading the book this morning at around 9am and swiftly grabbed the news paper to see when the first showing was.  I was not disappointed.  The actors do indeed have lower voices now and they are obviously growing up.  The action is good in this movie also.  I agree with other comments the Draco Malfoy's father is wonderful.  He played a villian in THE PATRIOT and he plays an equally as EVIL person in CHAMBER OF SECRETS.  The movie is long but very good. Hagrid, Dobby, Professor Snape and the gang are in good form in this movie. Quite a performance by the late Sir Richard Harris as well.  I am suprised that the credits didn't mention that this movie was in loving memory of Sir Richard.  Year 2002 will be heralded as the YEAR OF THE FANTASY MOVIES.  I am so thankful that there are two more Harry Potter movies in the COOKER and one more Lord of the Rings.  Thank you Chris Columbus and Peter Jackson.",1
212,10.0,"This second movie in the Harry Potter series keeps going at a great rate. It continues to impress me how a 160 minute movie can act like its 20 minutes.  I just want more.  It's like, hey, don't end now.  I was having fun.  The entertainment in this movie is off the scale and I think this is why people love it.  I loved to poke fun at Harry originally.  (when it was just a book)  But after having religious fantatics crying foul, I had to go for it.  So now I own all the books, the first movie and now I've watched this one.  And the score is beginning to interest me. o_O",1
213,10.0,"This movie and sequel is similar in development to Lord of the Rings sequels, the similar magic movie. There are more mature characters. which are ironically having the same situation in their real life outside of acting. Therefore very convincing and realistic. Although bit too amateur for adult watchers, it is perfect for it's release date and best for people who already read a book, played a game, and watched previous sequel. Bit more complicated and mature than 1st sequel, but nothing too much, too quick, or too harsh.",1
214,7.0,"Not quite as much of a travesty as the first movie, but still dull, heartless and childish. Columbus is a completely sterile director who seems to have no desire to get good performances out of his actors. Never once during either Harry Potter film have I felt like I am watching a fantasy come to life: all I see are bad child-actors interacting with poor-quality special effects. I will never watch another Harry Potter movie ever again.",0
215,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the continuation Harry Potter 1 , even not having the same level of the previous one, is a good movie , the cast this all back , some gained more prominence in this film , and one of the novelties is the Kenneth Branagh , this really funny , the special effects are good , the picture is very good, Chris Columbus back in the direction , and he sends well , it wont be faithful in his work , Daniel Radcliffe is increasingly comfortable in his character, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also the soundtrack is great, the script has more problems than the first , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good, more is below than its previous.

216,8.0,OCULUS REPARO!!!! One of the most useful spells.,0
217,9.0,"Not as good as 'The Stoned Sorcerer' – but 'The Chamber of Dirty Little Secrets' is quite entertaining. Ha! I downplayed my opinion way too much. This movie is actually the second best of all the H.P. flicks (yes – I am using some snobby fan-speak for ""Harry Potter""). In the 'Stoner Sorcerer', I was so amazed at the magnificent panorama of Hogs-worthless School and its magical grounds. I was equally intrigued by the cute little cloaked preteens scampering about to and fro. Each of these bewitching little post-toddlers squeaked jolly incantations while idiotically waving about twig-like 'wands?' Can I have a 'sheesh and a wow? By the time 'Chamber-Pot' made its way to the big screen, all the old flash, quickly became old-hat. Don't get me wrong, it was great to see that the main characters, Scary Harry, Ron ""The Weasel"" Weasley and Her-Very-Very-Winey Granger all put some needed distance between the ground and the tops of their heads - alas if only that was enough. It was apparent that this cuddly clan of magical snot-slingers; while growing into a cool trio of thaumaturgy; were not that interesting. These guys were in dire need of back-up. Spoiler Alert – Spoiler Alert – OMG!!! We are first introduced to Dribbly the House Smurf. This little guy is overly clingy and whines way more than Her-Very-Very-Winey - he is such an irritating little toad. How can that be you ask? Please, watch the movie and then you tell me. What is the reason for this thing's existence? Create a massive audience-gag reflex? I have no clue. Oh yeah – he is also supposed be there to suck-up-to Scary Harry (now that is new...so is everyone else.) The next interesting character added is the Queen of the Throne Room – Groaning Girdle. Now she is really a cool character. And what makes her so cool? Well, not only is she a ghost (ooh yes – boo –very scary)and she lives in the toilet (If I were the author, I would have named her, 'Tinkles')guess what else she is very good at? Give up? She is ALSO fantastic at whining. If you haven't filled your popcorn bag with vomit yetwe are watching different movies. OK – OKit may not sound like it, but I did enjoy this movie very much. I did not read the H.P. Library of books, so I am no H.P. aficionado – I just enjoy good entertainment. This is some pretty great stuff and I highly recommend you watchwith a bag of popcorn of course.",1
218,2.0,"Again the execution is terrible. The movie has awful pace and no grace. The director choses to make everything slow, like thinking the kids in the audience wouldn't be able to follow a brisker pace, but without filling the scenes with anything other than plot related stuff. So the scenes are filled with exposition and not much else other typical bad jokes here and there. The exception is Kenneth Branagh (with limited time). Other than that, this movie is too boring and dull.",0
219,10.0,My Take: A fantastic special effects-laden adventure that's better than the original. One of the best in the series. ,1
220,10.0,"The magic is back!  Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.  With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the second chapter in the on-going saga of everybody's favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.  There's also a couple of surprises along the way as Harry encounters a rather singular character in his bedroom, and another deep in the Forbidden Forest.  And, yes, there IS a Quidditch match. ",1
221,7.0,"Like the first film, this is much better than I remember it being at the time. The CGI is a noticeable step up, Kenneth Branagh is having an almost illegal amount of fun, there's more than a hint of the real threat and darkness that will only grow over the course of the series and even a few moments of the right sort of strangeness. Too long, of course; but there's no doubt that magic is here.",1
222,8.0,"When I first saw this installment, I had trouble following the story. But after watching it the second or third time, it makes more sense. Also, on the first watch through, I was bored by midpoint, however, the next time I viewed the film, it wasn't so bad.",0

The only thing that could spoil it for me would be taking the characters that we have already fallen in love with, out of their roles. Who else could be our Harry Potter except for Daniel Radcliffe?  I adore Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson is sensational.  I hope they stay in these roles through every movie!",0
225,7.0,"The second Harry Potter film follows Harry and friends through their sophomore year at Hogwarts, the mystical school for young wizards. As has been stressed, now that the ground rules have firmly been established in the first film, the second can focus on deeper character development and plotting. And so it does. Hogwarts, wizards, magic, and all the rest of the J.K. Rowling milieu are taken for granted. They play a Quidditch match without having to explain the rules. ",1

It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But he did not heed the warnings of a house elf he met at the beginning of the film. At Hogwarts, strange things are happening: Harry starts hearing strange voices.

230,8.0,"First of all I want to start by saying that I (as a non Rowling reader), do not understand all the commotion about Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry Potter) growing up, which is accompanied with looking older and a breaking voice. What the heck wrong with that? All the other wizards in the film seem to grow older just as ordinary people, so why shouldn't Harry? I for one, don't care if he grows older, because every Harry Potter installment (as far as I know), starts one year later than it's predecessor and I think it is only natural then for Harry (and of course Daniel Radcliffe) to grow up and become more mature. I mean, if it already bothers some people now, I wonder what they'll say in 2004 when The Prisoner of Azkaban will be made! Anyway, I do not mind and that is what counts while I am watching the film.",0
231,6.0,"Chamber of Secrets is perhaps the least noteworthy of all the Harry Potter films. Although I find it amusing how, as a child, the giant snake was what fascinated me most about this film, whereas now it's the dick-supreme performance of Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy - getting older is a strange thing ...",0
232,6.0,"Probably one of the least memorable 'Harry Potter' films. While Chris Columbus' 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' has some important parts to it - such as establishing the Malfoy family's dark connections and introducing future significant characters like Tom Riddle, Dobby, and Moaning Myrtle - the overall story is relatively uninteresting and doesn't go anywhere new. And clocking in at nearly three hours, it frequently outstays its welcome, especially when the exposition gets overdone. Still, it's entertaining to watch, with strong performances from pretty much everyone involved.",1

But that necessarily isn't a bad thing because I very much liked the first one and the same director Chris Columbus is back for this outing. Like the first one, we have a Quidditch match again, the kids looks exactly the same, and it is again a true adaptation of the novel with another intriguing detective story (finding out who the Heir of Slytherin is). And again, John Williams (with William Ross' help) gives us a clone of his Sorcerer's Stone score (which again isn't a bad thing though I will have to wait until Azkaban for a truly incredible Potter score from Williams). All in all, a 7 out of 10.",0
236,2.0,It is never gonna work! Daniel Radcliffe has to go. My first review (philosophers stone) still applies to this one. Occasional comedy and moments of supreme by certain cast members and certain parts of the scripts create moments of magic. Sort of hits target audience but for genre sort of. However it is marked at a low 2 as the main part goes to Daniel who trashes the whole film. He should smarten his act up and learn how to act. He has slightly improved since the last one and that is why the mark goes from one to two.,1

I still think this one is great but not as great.",1

There's a little more fun to be had, a greater sense of danger and mystery and a few dark moments, indicating the route the series was going to take.

Directed again by Chris Columbus, this time, a few more risks are taken, and Hogwarts appears more magical and menacing this time round. The VFX are good as (MINOR SPOILERS) Harry escapes from terrifying spiders, and battles a ferocious Basilisk. Still, the film is way too long and the mid-section sags.

248,8.0,"Chris Columbus stays the course and creates the fullest Harry Potter movie, although it still feels more like the ferris wheel instead of the roller coaster. This is the movie that made me understand the obsession with Harry Potter. The first movie, as well as the first book, feels a little awkward, tentative. The Universe of the story comes into the light in this outing. This movie has the same stellar cast, which is joined by the goofy Kenneth Branagh and is supported by the emergence of the three young stars. Watson is the most improved. She seemed ready for a school play in the first movie. Ratcliffe's stronger voice makes him more believable. This movie, as all three have, suffers from deviation from the book. The worst offenses are the nicing of Branagh's Lockhart and of the final scene. Lockhart was a bit of a ditz in the book, but he was also little mean, which makes his choice in the chamber more natural in the book. The final scene of the book in Hogwarts shows just how smart Dumbledore is, while the movies tend to make him look like too much of a minor character. This can also be said of Snape's diminished role. The special effects are a lot stronger in this movie. Dobby, who returns in Goblet, is a real treat, a good intentioned trouble maker. If you didn't like Sorceror's Stone, try this and don't miss Prisoner of Azkaban, the movies have at least gotten one thing similar to the books, each is richer than the last.",0

It's harry and the gangs 2nd year Harry eager for his return, soon finds himself wrapped up in a dark mystery that has plagued Hogwarts for the last 50 years. Students are petrified, harry begins hearing strange voices and message are written in blood, all pointing to a single thing the chamber of Secrets. Chamber of secrets continues to capture everything that Stone manages to achieved, and add a even more enticing tale this time around. With the first film establishing Hogwarts, and the basic of the wizarding world, it doesn't have to waste on all that and hops straight into the story. While still have fun and laughs We're giving more of a mystery built around the history of Salazar Slytherin. Everybody still manages to give warming performance's. Harry while still a kid has an once more courage, it shows that he's slowly growing and trying to find his meaning in all this. The film gives also slight more insight on Ron and Hermione life's. It's here where we see the entire Wesley family for the first time, and the kind of people they are very much like Ron. It's was hinted in the first film that Ron clearly didn't have as much money as some of the other students. Regardless though their still a normal loving famliy, happy just trying to get by and have each other. As well with the message of muggleborns with Hermione gives an idea of the class system in the Wizarding community is like in a way hinting at the future events. The Book shop scene says enough when you meet Malfoy again along with his father whose even worst. Just the way Lucius Malfoy speaks it no wonder Draco is the way he is. Dobby at first glace comes off as rather annoying though when you learn more about him you do feel more sympathy toward his actions. The most questionable character of them all Gilderory Lockart(Kenneth Branagh). Not in a bad way he's with out a doubt the funniest in the movie. Branagh is having a blast with this role. This full of himself wizard celebrity, that along the female students just fall for him, and the boy are just like really? I mean really even as kid the second you see this guy you know he's so full of crap, it really makes you wonder how Dumbledore aloud this guy a job as a teacher let alone defense against the dark arts. The visuals still impressive for the time, managing to have that mix of cg though still relaying on it only when necessary. The quidditch matches look way better here the cg doesn't near as stand out as the first film. As well as a transformations that's pretty flawless. The practical effects of the sets and the monster like the Basilisk or Aragog. While still following a similar formula as Sorcerer's Stone. The Chamber of Secrets still has tones of charm to it, and leaves us a on a happy note wanting for the next adventure.",1

259,10.0,"Many people say that Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is much better than it's predecessor due to the more, action, entertainment, and thrills, but not with me what I look for in a Harry Potter movie is good action, entertainment, humor,acting, effects (now I do because e I didn't expect these types of effects to be used in Sorcerer's Stone.), and many more. The movie tells the story of while Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) is back in his Uncle Vernon's (played by Richard Griffiths) and his Aunt Petunia's (played by Fiona Shaw) home with Potter being tortured starved and neglected just like he was in the very first Harry Potter movie, meanwhile while Vernon has guests over and gets distracted talking a little house elf by the name of Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones) comes along to tell Harry not to return to Hogwarts because something very serious that he for some reason doesn't mention because maybe that is all he knows what happened, or whether none of the professors told him that the chamber of secrets had been opened. And of course Potter thinks that Dobby is bluffing because from what I believe he doesn't think that it was possible for someone to get it to open.After the short/rackety and over-dramatic visit that Dobby gave to Harry, then all of the sudden Harry gets rescued by his old friend Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint). One thing that I have noticed while watching the first two Harry Potter movies I noticed that they both reminded me of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy of which I saw earlier this year. There is a lot of things I do love about this movie, of which I love the characters, casting choices, costumes, the magnificent score by John Williams, direction by Columbus, the screenplay, and the visual effects to this movie. This movie is one of the best fantasy movies that i have seen in a very long time, and I hope that I do enjoy the rest of the Harry Potter movies which includes Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Goblet of Fire (2005), Order of the Phoenix (2007), Half Blood Prince (2009), and Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 (2010 and 2011).",1

While this one is less padded than the original, lacking so much of the expositionary stuff, it could still have used some judicial cutting, losing a good half hour of the running time from this 2 hour and 45 minute film would have helped tighten things up enormously. Still, the film does have its entertaining moments and the young cast is getting better with each entry.It's also a hoot to see Kenneth Brannah hamming it up as one of the instructors. GRADE: B",0

The way the story is told is kind of similar first movie, but I consider that as a good thing as it was easy to follow and kept me intrigued.

Slightly better than the first one, although Daniel Radcliffe still needs some serious acting lessons as he yet again manages to ruin too many scenes with his slow and cautious babbling. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley manages to give the funniest scene in the entire movie as he manages to put a very unpleasant spell on himself. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy looks hellishly evil and I look forward to seeing him in the fourth movie and Emma Watson is much less annoying in this second installment. But the movie is (again) overly long for what it has to tell, which is stupid since the main public are the children. Some nice scary spider moments, though. A movie where nothing is a coincidence, where everything you hear and learn will happen and where Harry Potter once again manages to look like a conceited and annoying knowitall.

The first film made the mistake of doing a proportional reduction of the material across the board, leaving too many things in there, and inevitably in a rather underdeveloped state.  This still happens here occasionally, e.g. Harry's trip to Knockturn Alley has been reduced to the point where it contributes so little that it would have been better to cut it altogether, but this is more an exception than the rule.

316,,"When a special appears on television showcasing the talents of one or more magicians we tend to tune in to see the spectacle unfurl before our eyes, but why do we o it? The answer is very simple, because it is entertaining and within the programming we see things happen that enchant us, almost like for that short while we are swept away into a whole new universe without ever having to move from the comfort or our own homes. So why do people feel the need to condemn instead of embrace Harry Potter? Usually when a sequel is placed upon us we find that there are one of two possibilities. One, it is just a retread of its predecessor or two, it does nothing more than build upon concepts that were already presented in the first. That is why sequels are not usually found as entreating as the original. But by no means is this film even a sequel of any sort, it is merely a continuation of where the first film so gracesly left off, you will even notice that there are no opening credits to be found. We open our film with a scene in which Harry is visited in his new home by an adorable elf named Dobby (voiced beautifully by Toby Jones). Dobby tell Harry not to go back to Hogworth Academy or something bad will happen to him, but despite the warnings Harry returns and the magic unfolds. The film takes on a much more mature tone than the first making it much darker and scarier, especially for the younger children, but even through all that darkness those young children are not forgotten about and are let off with some mild humour during several of the darker scenes to lighten the load. But humour is not just used for that sole purpose. The film is often very funny, hilarious even (mainly thanks to the highlight of the show, Dobby) giving it a very warm and light-hearted feeling as well. the direction from Chris Columbus is extremely fast paced and astounding. The scene in which the children take part in a witches sport features some of the most exhilarating action sequences I have seen since Spider-Man. The special effects are simply jaw-dropping and marvellous in every way imaginable. Everything has such smooth texture and is places so well among the live actors that it is hard to believe that what is happening isn't actually real. I was also able to pick up a few points from the script that were so ironic they almost come off as satirical. For instance there is a line uttered that goes ""funny how a silly book can cause so much damage."" It would seem to me that by saying that the film is trying to touch upon the controversy that the Harry Potter franchise has started by telling the audience that books are merely an outlet for our own personal entertainment and not made to cause trouble or any sort. Much of the original cast has returned with some new faces here and there. I must say, for a film that relies mostly on performances from young actors there was a fairly high degree of talent to be found from the young stars. It is also nice to know that Richard Harris could end his career on a high note as Albus Dumbledore (The veteran actor recently passed away) and Kenneth Branagh also adds a good does of comedy into the fold as a renowned wizard who may not be all that his reputation says he is. You can also catch a glimpse of Monty Python Veteran John Cleese in a small role but delightful role as a ghost who can remove his head. A lot of fuss has been made from select Christian groups over this franchise, they deem that it is wrong to depict a human with Godly powers, and some even go for enough as to call it demonic. But instead of burning the books and starting protests why can't we just concentrate on the positive. This film has very strong morals on friendship and determination. It also shows teenagers as independent human beings who are just as worthy as any grown-up. So why not give it a rest and take Harry Potter for what it really is, good old fashioned adventure that is highly entertaining and dazzling in epic proportions. You may notice that I have yet to say anything bad about this film, but still it has only received four stars. Well if it is bad news you are waiting for you are going to be very disappointed because the truth is there is nothing wrong with this film as far as I can see. But the fact that I am not a hardcore Harry Potter fan, or even a general Harry Potter fan leaves me with a personal bias. This film probably deserves five star, but because of this bias I was probably not able to enjoy this film has much as the fans would have. Nevertheless it is an amazing achievement or a film that older children and open-minded adults will have a field day with.",1
317,10.0,"I mostly give 10 star rating to movies that blow my mind with script writing and screenplay, although this one is legendary movie and there were lots of secrets that made to a part of movie. If you haven't watched it or showed this to you children go ahead and watch. If you already watched it then please rate.",0
318,7.0,"This movie, like the first, was very well done. Also like the first one, there were some major and minor differences; however, not all of these seemed to work as well. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. The most glaring example is how they butchered the ending of the movie. That didn't happen even remotely that way in the book. They made the Harry Potter character look kind of dumb with the way he reacted in the chamber whereas in the book, the things that happened weren't necessarily in his control and he had to react in certain ways in order to survive. Also, they cut out quite a bit of the process Harry, Ron, and Hermione took in discovering the secret. Still, they ultimately got the gist of the book and didn't really leave out anything too major. The acting of the students was drastically improved so the movie flowed smoother. I just thought they could've done a much better job with the book-to-movie adaptation.",0
319,7.0,"Well, I think that when they made this one, what they were looking for was to remind the audience of why they liked the first one and for the first hour, they do just that and from there they move onto a darker and cleverer version of Harry. Now, in this one it seems that some actors who did maybe not so well in the first one were starting to really pick up in this one like Hermoine. Well, there was again lots of talk about this one like whether Daniel Radcliffe could keep up with the ever evolving character but he pulled it off with what seems like very little trouble although I doubt highly that it would not have been a little trouble. Well this one has better special effects then the first one and they had done a great job extending the characters to fit in with times and the effort used in this one is just so cleverly used. Once again, they got away with some scenes cut out in this one. I rate this 74%.",1
320,,"I mentioned in my first Harry Potter' review, that I had big expectations' when I got around to seeing the sequel titled the chamber of secrets.' Having now seen it, and sure it is an entertaining movie, but for me, it did not have the same appeal as the first film had. But if I was ten years old, I am sure that this movie would be a classic, which I am sure the movie world will one day be calling it. I am not sure whether it deserves such praise.   ",1
321,8.0,"It's interesting to watch a sequel to a movie. Sometimes the sequels are well made, sometimes, if not most times, they aren't as good. But I noticed that if a movie is based off of a book series... then it tends to be well done, even if the books may have not been the greatest, or if the movie wasn't completely true to the book. However, with Harry Potter, it seems as though the first two movies are well done. The second being better than the first, in my opinion.",1
322,7.0,"This movie had a very different tone to the sorcerer's stone, It felt more on edge with a bit of anxiety thrown into the mix. I do remember being scared by this film as a small child and being repulsed by Ron's slug vomiting scene to which I would grab the remote and turn the TV off as fast as possible. Later I would grow to appreciate this film more as the film went places the the previous didn't.",1
323,8.0,"The Chamber Of Secrets is significantly better with each viewing. The film greatly improves upon the first installment's flaws, which those who read my first review will remember I said had too minor a focus on the main plot of the Stone and more focus on the world-building and exposition. This film's main narrative of the Chamber being opened again is much more present, Steven Klove finally finding a perfect balance between the bits of them interacting with the Wizarding World, and the bits of the main driving narrative. ",1
324,10.0,"Geeze, it was just last year I was raving about the most hyped film of last year, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERERS STONE.  I loved how well done it was protrayed from the J.K. Rowling best seller, the actors, sets, costumes, etc.  I thought Daniel Radcliffe, was excellent as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermoine Granger.  Now, 364 days later, I experience more magic again in the follow-up sequel, HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. This time, unlike the original, the film begins right into the plot. Where the original introduced viewers to characters, locations, magic items and history.  Think of it like, uh... LETHAL WEAPON 2, it begins right into the action, which CHAMBER OF SECRETS does as well. It's been three months since Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) left Hogwarts for summer vacation, and it hasn't been a fun summer since Harry is living at Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and rude cousin Dudley (Harry Melling).  But Harry wonders why haven't any of his friends from Hogwarts (particulary Ron and Hermoine) haven't written to him.  Then Harry meets Dobby, a house elf who warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts.  Harry ignores Dobby, since Hogwarts is a million times nicer than his realitives. But this year attending at Hogwarts there are some faces introduced. First is Lucius Malfoy (that wonderful character actor Jason Isaacs) the cruel and vicious father of Harry's rival Draco Malfoy.  Then there's Professor Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) who smiles proudly and is the most vain person you could ever see.  But this year at Hogwarts (and why does this happen when Harry attends school there?) there is evil lurking about that turns some students petrified and messages written in blood on the wall warning about ""the Chamber of Secrets."" Like I said, I highly loved the orignal film, THE SORCERER'S STONE, and how does this one come up to par?  This is another winner!  I enjoyed this film just as much, if not more than the original.  But then again, I've read the first two books of Harry Potter, and I enjoyed CHAMBER OF SECRETS more than SORCERER'S STONE. Why is this film better? First, the film goes right into the action, I understand the original had to introduce the world to the story, and that was fine.  Yet this film goes right into the action and begins telling us what is going on.  Like the STAR WARS, GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE films, it assumes that we did see the first film (and who didn't?).  Second, I always thought the action was more exciting and intense in CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and in this film it shows.  Third, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson all fit into their character roles so fine and well, that we are now acceppting them as Harry, Ron, and Harmione, just like we accept Harrison Ford as Han Solo, or Al Pacino as Michael Corlone.  It's just that this time around, all three young actors seem more relaxed and calm about playing their roles, and I don't blame them.  Plus the same goes for the other actors who are returning to this film.  Finally, it's more darker, complex, and exciting than the original. With HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, the Potter films are becomming to be a series worthy of being placed with other great series like STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES.  This film running about twenty minutes longer than the original, goes just as fast, if not faster than the original. Proof:  I didn't have to go to the bathroom, I stuck it out through out all of the film. Sadly, this film isn't getting the hype like the original.  I'm guessing that the press is tired of hyping up the Potter films and figures that it's going to be a hit. Then there are those people who feel like STAR WARS, ""you've seen one, you've seen them all.""  Well, I'm hoping that word gets around and people realize that like the books, the Potter films are getting better as Harry gets older.  I guess you can say that Harry Potter is indeed like fine wine and ages well with it.  This film should do more business than the original, but not even the superior EMPIRE STRIKES BACK couldn't make more money than STAR WARS (A NEW HOPE to the Jedi fanatics).",1

333,,"This movie rocked.  It was your classic, edge-of-your seat excitement with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and a scene-stealing flying car.  True to the book, this movie gives the vivid details of the dreaded Chamber of Secrets and the story of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who lives in the girls' bathroom. It also has its share of hilarity as Ron's owl flies into a bowl of chips while delivering a stern message to Ron from his mother.  As a Christian, I also had to examine the morality of the film.  This movie IS NOT and I repeat, IS NOT for children under the age of 10.  The woman sitting next to us had to escort her screaming daughter out of the theater (I estimate she was about 5 or 6 years of age).  There are too many jump scenes that can makes this scary for the younger set.  The violence in this film is on the borderline of PG and PG-13.  There really isn't any ""witchcraft"" in the film.  All it is is fantasy, just like C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" but if it still bothers you, then don't see the film.",1

Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",0
336,7.0,"Review:<br /><br />'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and is the second instalment in the Harry Potter film series.<br /><br />This movie is said to be the worst in the series. I really don't consider that to be the case. I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a mystery film.<br /><br />Its story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a monster that petrifies the school's denizens.<br /><br />The acting is miles ahead of where it was in the first movie. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs, who are great additions to the cast. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still not fully into their prime yet, but still put on good performances.<br /><br />The runtime is a bit long, and some of the elements get lost throughout, but the overall story is entertaining and keeps you engaged. I also enjoy the mystery element that this movie brings. Finding out who opened the Chamber of Secrets and finding out who Gilderoy Lockhart actually is.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't have the nostalgia of the first one, but still holds up in the franchise.<br /><br />3.5/5",1

338,6.0,"This movie, about an ancient prophecy which seems to be coming true when a mysterious presence begins stalking the corridors of a school of magic and leaving its victims paralyzed, is not as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). It still had a mysterious story with both secrets and dangers, and excitement at some points. However, there were things that disappointed me a little. There were mysteries that needed to be solved, but I think it got too much of the danger scenes, especially the spider scene. It felt unnecessary. Other scenes also felt too long. I think the final act was decent, and the best part of the movie, if we talk about the story where things got revealed, but also a little cliché when it comes to the action scene with the Basilisk. I feel like the less important scenes delayed the time of the more important ones. Unfortunately, the climax didn't really rich the top, for my part. So overall, a mysterious movie, but with too much of the unnecessary danger scenes.",1

These are vital persons that would need a wider exposure in the story. Neither movie would lose in becoming a few minutes (10?) longer. The evil Lucius Malfoy, however, was great!

Out of the 3 kids, I think that Emma Watson is the best actor. She IS Hermione and she is perfectly cast.  This movie is a Bit long, but it is good. My favorite scene of the entire movie is the WONDERFUL scene at the end involving Fawkes the Phoneix.  The part where he cries is so inspiring and so wonderfully written and with the music, its just fantastic.  The scene is one of the best scene's in the whole entire Potter franchise so far.

Harry is visited by a house elf named Dobby who tries to warn him that for his own safety he shouldn't return to school for the following year. The start of this movie also shows us our first glimpse of the Weasley household, Ron's Parents and Draco Malfoys father. Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts, the movie has a very similar feel to the first one; We are taken through the school year at a nice pace with plenty of things happening and several instances where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves in the wrong place at wrong time. The chemistry and on screen friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione grows during this movie and makes for a much better experience as you start to see their personalities much more. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets contains all the values you expect from a Harry Potter movie. Friendship, loyalty and courage are the base of the movies messages and it does a fantastic job of appealing to children and adults alike. Near enough all the cast return from the previous movie and we also get to see several extra characters who slot right into the movie effortlessly. The final scene of this movie is more effective and better made than the first movie and for the first time we get a glimpse of what's to come from Lord Voldermort. We also get some back story through a series of flashbacks which help us gain a better understanding of Lord voldermort and leave us with questions which will be answered in the later movies! I find it hard to write reviews for movies which are in a series as I don't like to give anything away, I won't say anymore now other than, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very well made movie with a long run time which doesn't drag at all. I personally prefer this one to the first and out of all 8 movies its certainly one of my favourites. 9/10",1
377,8.0,"i really didnt want to see this, since when i went to the first one, i almost fell asleep and then after leaving the cinema, i got the entire point of harry and liked the movie a lot. i just couldnt handle the 2 hours sitting there and watching the wizards do stuff. this one, the chamber of secrets, was much more interesting to me. the characters seemed to able to perform to the top notch of their abilities, and had me wondering what was causing the chaos at hogwarts. you wont be disappointed in the movie at all, if you are into the whole wizardry ideas coming about nowadays, since lord of the rings and harry are in battle against each other to reel in the better scores and audiences from around the globe, then this movie is a must see for you. with the cute new alien thingy, dobbie, who is only in the movie for like 10 minutes altogether. that really blows, since he had the attention of all those who like the computerized things that walk around in harry's world of makebelieve!  so, get your flying car and fly to blockbuster for a great edition to the harry craze!

378,7.0,"Chris Columbus returns to direct The Chamber of Secrets, and he does a very nice job of taking everything he's learned from the first installment, and improved on them. Columbus seemed more comfortable this time around, being more free with his style and shot selection, crafting another well told story. He kept the continuity from the first, while incorporating a slightly darker tone, that works extremely well with what Columbus was going for. Columbus capitalizes on fleshing out this brilliant world, while giving the characters more layers, but he kept things pretty safe, incorporating a little bit more exposition. I give Columbus credit for making this more of a story-based film, with nice conflicts and mystery, but he had a tough time pacing all the events out. He allowed for a great deal of filler, and subplots, that makes the film feel inconsistent, and unfocused.",1

I like that the story goes in a completely different direction - it's something all of these films do really well and it makes them feel very fresh and different to one another.

Christian Coulson. They have huge careers ahead of them,and the established actors and actresses all have the time of their lives. Kenneth Branagh was a perfect choice to play Professor Lockhart. So was Miriam Margoyles,as Professor Sprout(one of my personal favorite characters.) Of course,Richard Harris did a masterful job as Headmaster Dumbledore(my favorite character); whoever designed his office deserves an award.

I believe Daniel, Emma and Rupert have progressed wonderfully and cant wait to see more as I believe they have the potential to not become type cast into these roles and of course Mr Coletrane toped it off need I say more?

401,8.0,"Having recently re-read the book prior to viewing the film, I won't bore anyone with listing the changes or omissions, most of them made sense and worked with the flow of the story. I enjoyed the book version of ""Chamber of Secrets"" more than the book version of the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" so I went to the theater expecting quite a bit. The first film exceeded my expectations and, again, this raised my level of expectations for the second film. Richard Harris, Kenneth Branagh, and Daniel Radcliffe are all quite good and although the direction is brisk and involving some of the editing is not quite as crisp as ""Sorcerer's Stone"". The Quidittch match is great and there are no distractions in the form of obvious computer generated characters. Doby, the house elf, is one of the better CGI characters I have yet seen. Is it perfect? I think the story is just too involved for a 2 hour kids film. There are a few layers of complexity and depth that simply work as literature and don't quite translate to the medium. !SPOILER!",1

I was thoroughly disappointed, and don't know if I can express my discontent in 1,000 words, so I'll cut to the point. If you are interested in Harry Potter at all, and have yet to see the movies, you should see the first one, ask a friend to sum up the gist of the second movie (should take roughly 25 seconds) then go rent the third one from the library, so you won't get charged to see that horrible (but not quite as horrible as CoS) movie.

Spiders give me and everyone nightmares, this time there's several Giant tarantulas chasing Harry and Ron.  there's more evil curses and horror than before.  We even get to meet the Weasley family who's home was a rural peculiar looking home, I'd love to see how they created it on set. Oh, and Ron is dumber than ever, and they get to fly a car to school, and get attacked by a tree! There's also more competitive quidditch matches,., and make-believe creatures. My rating ****1/2 out  of 5.",1
419,10.0,"J K Rowling has a unique talent. She takes the basic structure of a boarding school story and works in elements of classical mythology, Arthurian legend and many other things. Because she taps into so many diverse sources that is one reason the books have sold tremendously well (that's an understatement) and they have been made into films which star the cream of the acting profession. It's not often you get a film which draws on old legends which also includes steam trains and Ford Anglias. Harry Potter has forever altered the way people look at a Ford Anglia. This film, though, is a bit more scary than the first one (in fact the films have got progressively scarier) and the scenes with the basilisk may be a bit too much for small children. I am also a bit arachnophobic (like Ron Weasley) and the scene with the spiders made my flesh creep. But this is still a great film. Although it's a fantasy film, children can still relate to it. When he's not at Hogwarts, Harry lives in a street of Brookside houses, namely Privet Drive. Kids can relate to this setting as it is one many of them will identify with. Many of the children's stories of yore like Peter Pan and the Phoenix and the Carpet had their real world sections in upper class Victorian or Edwardian nurseries, which is just as much a fantasy world for modern kids as Neverland or Narnia. This aspect has also contributed to the success of the Harry Potter books and films.",1

But once they arrive strange things start to happen as students are petrified and turned to stone by an unknown enemy. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened and the monster that lurks within has been set free - But by whom? This is one of the best Children's films since the golden age of Disney, and will appeal to Grown Ups as well as little'uns, with a fantastic supporting cast that includes:- retuning stars Maggie Smith,Robbie Coltrane,Richard Harris in one of his last roles (he sadly died before the film was released) and newcomer to the series good English chappy Kenneth Branagh as the new Teacher of the Dark Arts.

433,7.0,"The first sequel to ""Harry Potter"" is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one. Or, I should say, despite some uneven pace and tone of the film, it is much more three- dimensional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy. Harry Potter is in the second year at Hogwarts, and now is ready to go back to the school, in spite of the advice given by strange creature called Dobby, who shows up before him to warn that very bad things would happen if Harry goes back. But Harry ignores his warnings anyway, and starts his new year at the school, only to find weird occasions that remind him of Dobby's words. And finally, he is to know that ""The Chamber of Secrets,"" about which no one (including the teachers) knows -- its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets -- is opened by someone inside of the place, and students start to fall victims to it. Can Harry stop the danger, and regain the peace for the school? The premise seems similar to that of the original film, but the overall tone of the film gets darker and more sinister. It is possible that some of the pre-teen kids might find the film too scary at some time (especially they don't like slugs, spiders and snakes), and perhaps adults find it the same way. Don't underestimate the film's dark elements any more. But the most remarkable thing about ""Chamber of Secrets"" is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one. The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one. With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them). The only weak point is its new character Dobby, created all by CGIs, which still looks unnatural sometimes. Moreover, in the opening sequence, the film attempts to get laughs using Dobby not so effectively, making him a bit irritating creature like Jar-Jar Binks or Scooby-Doo. But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"") as Ron's mother. Another new character is given by Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, a new teacher (and a celebrity) at Hogwarts. Obviously he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's ""Celebrity."" And don't miss the brief scene after the end credit roll. Daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen. All the actors are good, but their presence seems to be rather sacrificed to establish darker images of the school. So, John Cleese is allowed to speak very briefly only twice, and even Maggie Smith and Allen Rickman are not allotted enough time to impress us. You brink your eye, and you will miss Fiona Shaw! It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike. But how will they keep this pace in the future? Is it possible to combine evil elements with the concept of family picture? That is my only concern, and the second sequel would show the answer.",0

I'm sure this is good enough for the kids and some parents may get a laugh from the calculated and shallow (read: poor) humor, but for any self respecting filmbuff, this is just a terribly naive ""gobbuldy-goo"". Only things missing are the Disney-logo and a narrator to explain the lesson of the film. Plus, it's a terrible waste of good talent (Isaacs, Rickman, Coltrane), but worst of all, this will remain as the last film of the great Richard Harris. What a shame.

This is very important because now I am not sure if the book or the movie was better. I thought Dobby was the coolest thing in the movie. He was really funny and I thought the computer-animation was really accurate on how Dobby was described in the book. The Qudditch match was really great too seeing the two rivals Malfoy and Harry head-to-head.

I would prefer the first Harry Potter, at least it was all fresh and it is not as drained out. The problem this movie has is similar to many other sequals like Austin Powers, james bond, rocky... The sequal is the same as the first. However, those comedy movies like 'powers'  do not try to take itself seriously, this one does and that is what makes it unbearable.",0
454,5.0,"First, I'm an anti-Harry Potter fan. Why? Because of the adults going ape-crap over them saying how great they are. They're kid's books, people! Has the average IQ really sank so low that adults can't be bothered to read books by, lets say, Dostoevsky or Tolstoy? What gets me going is that half of these adults who like the Potter books, were same people in the '80s who would think playing D&D is satanic. Now the hypocrites are getting a dose of their own medicine. Why did I go and see this? Just because I'll watch a movie to hang out with friends. The movie, I thought, was better than the first but that's not saying much. It had its strengths (f/x, sets, some good ideas) but too many weaknesses. I hate the over-acting, even if it is done on purpose. (MINOR SPOILERS ON) I strongly dislike Rawling's sense of humor, e.g. the angry screaming letter for Ron from his parents. And I don't like the pointless Quidich (sp?) game, the rules of which seem inconsistent. The house elf wasn't funny. It doesn't make sense how how Harry and his friend found the train using the car. And didn't the plumbers installing the sinks notice the Chamber of Secrets? I had many other complaints but I won't bother.(SPOILERS OFF) Is it enjoyable? It's okay, better for kids. Does it deserve to gross 300 million plus? No.",0
455,,"Okay, if you love Harry Potter nothing I say will matter. Speaking as a filmmaker, this is a film that exists to showcase the f/x. The actors, with the exception of the lead, are so far over the top to be laughable. Kids will probably love the film. Adults will find the 2:40 MTV pacing to be exhausting. This is probably the last of the Harry Potter films I will personally see, because there is tremendous pressure on Chris Columbus and the rest of the team to continually outdo the previous films. If the next one paces any faster, the result will be kinesthetic seizures. Sorry kids, but films are ultimately about acting and story. Special Effects are a wonderful enhancement, but otherwise they are like an orchestra that plays so loud, you can't hear the dialog. 4/10",0

459,10.0,"I thought this was better than the first. I've read all the books and am impatiently waiting for the next. Each book gets darker and darker as Harry gets older. All I have to say to people complaining that this was too much like the first is what did you expect? Just to fill you in the entire series is about Harry Potter, a boy wizard and his adventures at the Hogwarts. Guess what? He's going to interact with the same set of characters and he's going to be battling the same evil threat every time, which is his nemesis Voldemort. Here are some Major Spoilers. In case you missed it....Malfoy plants the diary in the Weasley girl's bag. She starts interacting with it. Volemort's spirit is in the diary and starts to thrive on her energy. She gets scared and tries to throw it away. Potter finds it. Which enlightens him about Hagrid's past at the school. It's more of a mystery than the first one. On a special note..Gilderoy Lockhart was not ""the bad guy"" he was an arrogant, cowardly, blowhard. The continuing theme in the books is that Hogwarts keeps losing their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. If I sound overly sarcastic and patronizing it's because I am. This movie is way too intense for little kids, but both of them are going to be classics just like Willy Wonka and Wizard of Oz, because they ARE too intense for little kids. We adults may not think of them as classics, but we're not the ones who are currently being mesmerized and captivated. Of course the child in me is completely bewitched by the entire series. This may be why the Xian sects are all up in arms. They want their children fearing hell and damnation, not a wizard who can be defeated by a little boy. I've heard all the arguments of why Harry Potter is luring kids to witchcraft....so what if it is? I say we can use more witches and warlocks in this world and less religious bigotry, repression and ignorant violent behavior ignited over say.... a beauty pageant. It's highly entertaining and original and is classic just like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka, The Dark Crystal, Nightmare Before X-mas. ",1

This film is more action packed, exciting, and funnier then the first film, with the wonderful child stars giving more confident performances. Daniel Radclife, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have really settled into their roles nicely, and the adult cast are too, terrific. Kenneth Brannah almost steals the show as the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. The showdown at the end is tense and exciting, and even though I'd read the book I still gasped in several places. The flying car and Dobby are just some of the brilliant CGI effects, and the Qudditch match is fast and furious.

Both of the plots involve something very secret, and end (SPOILERS) with a climatic battle against Voldemort. Now, this is not to say that the film is not entertaining.

My sister told she that she felt ""The Chamber of Secrets"" was the most boring book out of all the Harry Potter books so I was a little skeptical about this movie. The movie started off with repetitive elements from the first one such as Harry not being able to go to the school etc. It had some humorous moments in the beginning, but I found the flying car to be very cheesy. The imagery in the movie was top notch, sporting some of the best eye candy I've ever seen. Ah, the glory of technology. The cast was very strong because one of the most important elements in sequels is to bring back the same actors that played the characters. History has shown the failure of many sequels because of different actors replacing the originals, it makes a huge difference. Signing these kids to a 3 year movie contract was a brilliant move.",1

471,1.0,"I consider myself a good critic of fantasy/children films...Mostly due to my attention span never developing beyond the age of 7 and my hunger for magical things being so alive I kept the stupid window to my room open for Peter Pan at the age of 14...Oh I knew he was not real, but what is the point of rubbing that in...Therefore, me falling asleep during the first Harry Potter film and fighting with sleep during the second one definitely means SOMETHING...I must admit I didn't really expect much in the first place; creating a huge movie from a popular book ON DEMAND can never spell art, but I thought maybe, MAYBE, it could be fun...Not only was I disappointed by the fact that bits and pieces were cut out completely (Ok, I understand the necessity) but why add USELESS parts then that could be found nowhere in the book and add cheapness to the already bad movie?? (Indiana Jones scene of almost falling out of the flying car in the second movie? Artistic freedom? What artist? What art?) Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't read the book we would not care at all about the characters of the film since they are never really developed in the movie...It is hard for us to notice this fact since we do heavily rely on our memory of the book to follow the movie; yet the fact that there is very little connection between the audience and the kids does subconsciously ruin a great deal...Bland conversations, overdone special effects (was Dobby really THAT freaky and unlovable looking?? Since when??? Couldn't we have a touch less computer graphics and a bit more human touch?) and cheap shots at making us laugh...mostly relying on Ron saying things like: ""can we go now, I am scared"" (insert a stupid and annoying facial expression)...Where did the subtle darker humor go? Basically, it is sad to note that this may be the fantasy children movie of the new generation...No memorable original moments, humor or truly magical scenes (ET, Goonies, Time bandits, Mary Poppins etc)...Basing it all on computer animation, special effects, plot and mooooney...Brainwashed kids will like it, adults will forget what to look for and we can all be convinced that since the media tells us it is grand, then it must be so...A good fantasy movie is not supposed to make us bored, not even for a minute; it is supposed to keep us wanting to see certain scenes again and again, making us remember the movie as something we find special and original, and I just cannot wait to see that scene where Harry is walking and then he stops and says something!!!!!

473,7.0,"I have just watched the second Harry Potter movie again and I thought I should review it this time. First off, I would like to say that this was one of my favorites of the series, because it is not all happy sunshine and roses, and yet not super dark and sometimes frightening Deathly Hallows type of a movie. I like that. I will start with the acting. Fantastic by all, and great in special effects scenes. The best acting job for a woman was by Maggie Smith, or Minerva McGonagall, in my opinion. She had a straight face and never broke character at all in the entire movie. The best acting job for a man was by Richard Harris, or Albus Dumbledore, also in my opinion. All of the other acting was still good. To the dialogue. It was also great. Not cheesy, but still good enough to have a little bit of humor here and there around the film. Now the characters. J.K Rowling was very creative writing this book. She actually came up with the names for the characters from constellations and mythology, like Draco Malfoy, from the Draco constellation, and Remus and his brother Romulus Lupin, first names coming from two children in Greek mythology who were raised by wolves, and Lupin means wolf in Latin, I think, but I'm not sure. And of course, the special effects. They were awesome! A break from the completely CG world of movies today. It had some CG, but only when it was necessary. When it was not, they had extremely realistic huge figures, that at times, looked like they were real. Good job special effects guys! Lastly, the only reason I give this a 70% is because it is a little bit too long (I would have given it an 8).",1

Especially Dan Radcliffe as Harry. I was very impressed with his acting. It blew me away!! ",1

By the end you'll be sure of the fact that its not only for the children. The magical world unfolds more revealing more hidden secrets. The atmosphere of the movie is darker this time. The acts have done well as per earlier and undoubtedly its again a treat for us. I just believe that it could have been edited and made a bit short. Anyways the movie is really good and its a must. I won't say its better or worse than earlier but it holds on to the script tightly and is equally good.,1
478,10.0,"It is amazing, but unlike many sequels, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is better than the first part of the series. And the first part was really good. Still, this movie is quite spectacular. The actors are obviously matured after the first film and the atmosphere of the second part is cooler, darker (like in the book). The mystery of the creature-from-the-chamber is very interesting and the final moments of the film are simply amazing. Watch it and you'll see. My final words are a big ""Congratulations"" for sir Richard Harris. In his last role, the great actor played a wonderful Dumbledore, it was obvious, that he enjoys his work and this was a great thing. My rating: 11/10 :-)",1

It was a long movie coming in at 2:40, but I was not bored or anxious at all.  The only thing that bugged me in the movie was the noisy kids that were in attendance, but that was to be expected.  Even though this is a `kid' movie, I think the adults in the audience enjoyed it more. Kids seemed to get a little antsy at the 2-hour mark, but I don't care about kids.

Hermione is also looking more grown up and seems more friendly and relaxed.  I got tears in my eyes every time Dumbledore was there (Goodbye Richard Harris we will miss you so much). I rate this film a 10 because the minor changes and skips are bearable (the film is just the right length) but, don't drink to much soda early on or you'll be in the restroom when the chamber sequence is on.

Harry recieves warnings from a house elf named Dobby saying that ""Harry Potter must not go back to school!""

In the end, Harry prooves that he's more than a wizard, he's a herro! Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has grown a lot since the first film and his work has improoved greatly.

Yet as the picture went on it didn't feel like it was adding up to a whole lot. For all of the events and discoveries that occur within the film, the direction feels less inspired, the script feels less assured, and for all of the horrors that are occurring within the school, there doesn't always seem to be a whole lot of jeopardy.

We've already known a lot from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001): Harry being thwarted by a bunch of a-holes (The Dudleys), Hogwarts, the main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione and more). It was once again directed by Chris Columbus (this is his last Harry Potter movie) and scored by John Williams. This movie is a bit darker than the first one and the mystery was scarier for kids.<br /><br />We started in the Dursleys' house when Harry saw Dobby jumping on the bed (just look how adorable the elf is). At first I don't like him much because he had annoyed Harry so much. At least he was a good character in the end because we've already known what had happened and this guy Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, was worse than his tongue and knowing that Dobby's his slave made me calling Lucius a piece of excrement. The most adorable part of this movie is that Ginny went down and looked at Harry with wide eyes. That's just cute! As I said I hated Malfoy, I really liked the Quidditch scene when Malfoy was hit by Dobby's Rogue Bludger and had an accident. Good Riddance! There's this character I don't like, Gilderoy Lockhart: an arrogant guy who only learnt one charm and had been a fraud for a whole time writing books which had fake information about him fighting a creature and more. Even though he had writing skills, he's one of the weakest wizard and it was a pity when he lost his mind by his Memory Charm.<br /><br />There're more creative thing about the sequel. There're more creatures like The Basilisk and Dumbledore's Phoenix, the creature which had petrified Hogwarts students who were muggles (raised by human parents). There're a few parts I like better than the first movie. There's a Flying Ford Anglia showing audiences what magic is truly capable of and the mystery had more clues than the first one. Audiences were wondering what the Chamber of Secrets was. The clues were really scary seeing kids being petrified. In this movie, we had our first time seeing Lord Voldemort from the past still with the title Tom Marvolo Riddle. We also saw the first Horcrux: Riddle's Diary. There're more magical objects in the movie like Godric Griffindor's Sword. The CGI is as good as the previous movie. But the problem is that Hermions knew too much but in here she's petrified so we couldn't have her solving too much. They mystery should remain longer.<br /><br />This one's not as good as the Sorcerer's Stone but it's one of the darkest of the franchise and we're introduced more to magic and I like the way they were introduced.",1

Since the characters were mostly introduced in the first episode, these two hours had to be filled with plot.  Other than a couple of slow spots filled with silence it did pretty well.  Rupert Grint in particular had an opportunity to show off every possible expression and emotion;  he reminded me of Will Smith in MIB with his depiction of stark terror, disgust (slugs), nausea, stark terror and combinations of the above. Suggest Peter O'Toole for Dumbledore; as the character assumes more importance in Episode 3 and 4. Slower and darker, it still worked.  8/10",1
512,,"In light of all the reviews mooning over how great this movie is I would like to add my two cents.  I think the film is very good, just like the first movie, but it is not the greatest film ever made by any stretch of the imagination.  I realize many people see this as a kid's movie and thus being above criticism, but I actually think these movies were made for adults. How many kids under 10 do you know that can sit through three hours of movie?  It just seems to me, that when you see a film like Toy Story which says more in under 90 minutes then this movie does in three hours, you have to think about how it could have been better.  So much of the Potter films seems to rest on gimmicks: things that look really cool but ultimately serve as just backdrop.  Harry Potter has these amazing adventures without even the slightest amount of self-doubt.  This seems especially impressive when he confronts CG terrors that cause even adults to shiver.  Ultimately though there is no message that Harry Potter also feels fear and is therefore human.  I give this movie an A+ for direction, story, acting, and special effects.  For heart I give it an F.",1

514,7.0,"As Ron Weasley would say, this movie is ""bloody brilliant."" Of course, this time around he would say it in a much deeper voice. Indeed the children from the first film have matured beyond what anyone could have expected. Even though filming reportedly began shortly after The Sorcerer's Stone opened a year ago, every single child character seems to have gone through the biggest parts of puberty in just a year. Ron's (Rupert Grint) voice is cracklier, Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) is deeper, Malfoy (Tom Felton) seems to have grown feet, not inches, and Granger (Emma Watson) has transformed into an even more mature version of herself.",0
515,7.0,"Harry Potter..what can I say about this movie? Well let's start by pointing out that the movie had better graphics than the first movie.  The acting was questionable for some of the kids (including Harry Potter) but not for the adults.  I guess is because I'm from New York, I just don't buy the perfect image that HP is presenting; I guess that's why people call it fiction.  The kid is too proper, to innocent to be raise with such bad parents, I just don't buy it, it seems like a lie. I have to admit that I read the book, and I found the book so much better than the movie but not in the sense that most people are criticizing it. The movie portraits the book as perfect as it could, I just think that HP was meant to be read instead of being see.  Imagination is always different for most personal and by looking at the movie you are just exposing the point of view of a few people.  This is what I consider a true children's movie, I don't think I should be making a big deal out of how HP's acting or lack off, since children don't care about that, but they did over act a little bit.  I just found the film a little too corny for even a 22 year old kid.",1

521,10.0,"I know that I have already done a review of this film but I just can't say enough good things about it.  Usually sequels are not as good as the first movie but Chamber of Secrets went beyond the magic of the first film.  When the Harry Potter books first came out I didn't even know anything about them.  I finally started reading them last Thanksgiving and I was immediately hooked.  They are so great and J. K. Rowling has such a great imagination.  I think that my favorite scene from the movie was the one in the forest with Aragog and Lockhart was so funny but really cheesy also.  I think that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown in their acting abilities and they were fantastic, especially when Emma Watson had to act very emotional after she had been called a mudblood by Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton).  I must say that the 2 hour and 41 minutes length scared me a bit, I thought for sure I would have to get up in the middle to use the restroom.  But it seemed to go by so fast.  I was just sitting there watching it and my mom says we only have 40 more minutes to watch and it was such a surprise to me because I thought for sure we had a longer time than that.  It was like going to see a movie that was 2 hours and 41 minutes long but it only seemed like it was a hour and a  half.  That's just my opinion though.  What really surprised me was the amount of adults that were there, I thought for sure that I would be the only 18 year old there but there were a lot of teenagers and a lot of older people also.  Now that I have seen Chamber of Secrets I am really anticipating the release of The Prisoner of Azkaban.  This is my favorite book from the series right now and even though Chris Columbus isn't going to be a director I still think that it will be a great movie.  I hope that the actors stay on for the films because I don't believe that it will be the same without Emma, Daniel, and Rupert.  Well I hope that you all loved the movie as much as me. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10.  Perfect, A++++++.",1

The criticism this movie receives has some truth though. At 2 and a half hours long, Chamber of Secrets is one of the longest Harry Potter movies, strange considering it is one of the shortest books. Some scenes could and should have been left out, and others did not have the greatest writing. Also, the soundtrack is for the most part a repeat of the first movie (although for me, that isn't a bad thing, later movies did not match the soundtracks of the first two.) Despite all the faults, Chamber of Secrets does a superb job of capturing the adventure and mystery of the books, perhaps better than any other Harry Potter movie does. ",1

529,,"There are not many movies that can get me to the movie theatre, which have become miserable places for me since they banned smoking*S*  (the last movie I went to see in the theatre was The X Files) so it was with delight that after seeing ""Sorcerer's Stone"" on HBO I was chomping at the bit to go and see ""Chamber"" at the theatre this weekend.  I was not disappointed, and despite the length of the film I never once felt the need to sneak out for a quick inhale.  The initial delight was seeing the changes in the young cast, how they had grown and matured between the two films.  How Ron (Rupert) was now slightly taller than Harry, and how his voice is apparently in the throes of breaking (and would ""crack"" occasionally).  Harry (Daniel), slightly taller and a little fuller in the face and also with a voice a few octaves lower.  And Hermione (Emma), I shall quote Roger Ebert on that one ""on the road to babedom"". I will not be at all surprised if in ten years these three (Daniel, Rupert and Emma) are not the new Leonardo, Brad and Jennifer (albeit more than likely much better actors).  The film itself is a joy to behold and I was actually disappointed when it ended.  I genuinely laughed during the funny parts and the scary parts were genuinely scary.  It amazed me when the lights went up that I was in a theatre (it was the 7:15pm showing) that was packed with ""grown ups"" not a child in there, it says something about a ""kids"" movie that can pack a theatre with adults.  My husband and I had a long coversation over dinner afterwards about who they will cast to replace Richard Harris, as it would appear that we have already lost most of the ""elder statesmen"" of English actors, John Hurt could pull it off but he was in #1 as a different character and I think the kids are too savvy these days to let that one by them, Ian McKellen would be ace, but he is too busy being Gandalph and that would be too damn confusing, Anthony Hopkins (IMHO) is too short and stocky, Dumbeldore needs to be tall and willowy.  Perhaps the suggestion of another earlier that Sean Connery is the best choice should be considered.  Personally I would rather roll around in nettles than be the casting director with that thankless task right now.  I have a few minor problems with the movie (and they are minor) I really wish we had seen more of Mrs. Weasley, (I am a huge Julie Walters fan) when I heard that Harry goes to the Weasley's house I was looking forward to seeing much more of her, but just as soon as he was there he was heading up the chimney.  Jason Isaacs performance was, as always, beautiful, but I often wondered why on earth he was there, he appeared to ""appear"" simply for the point of appearing menacing.  Kenneth Branaugh, while (as always) BRILLIANT was to be honest a little too understated, perhaps he was trying hard not to go over the top, whereas I think with the character he played, over the top would have been the way to go.  Finally, the spider, being one of Hagrid's pets, I cannot imagine that he would allow his ""sons and daughters"" to eat a human, so that to me was a little unbelievable (I know its weird calling something in a Harry Potter movie unbelievable!) All in all it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and I cannot wait for it to come out on video so that I can watch it again and again.",0

And in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, ""The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware."" But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful Movie is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny.

The story is brilliant and it stays true to the book, yet works wonderfully on screen.  I believe that Harry Potter is THE fantasy series of the Millenial generation (kids under 20), the same way the Star Wars trilogy was for Gen X-ers.  That's not to say adults won't enjoy the film, because as a young 20-something, I am both a huge ""Star Wars"" and Harry Potter fan.",1
536,,"The film, now showing at the Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu, carries a PG certificate and rightfully so as the story features the petrification of countless characters and writing on the wall in blood! These scenes occur following an encounter with the beast let loose from the dreaded Chamber of Secrets. The whole plot revolves around the fact that the millennium-old chamber has been opened in an attempt to rid Hogwarts School of Witchcraft from mud bloods - those students whose ancestry includes non-witches. It's up to the main cast, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), to conduct the investigation into who has let the creature out, breaking all the school rules in the process. Witchcraft is practiced aplenty throughout the film and there are all sorts of nasty consequences, including a scene where a spell backfires consigning Weasley to eat slugs. The chemistry between the trio, directed by Chris Columbus, is believable but all three have visibly grown since last year's film. All three are much taller and the voices of both 13 year-old Radcliffe and 14 year-old Grint are beginning to break. There's even a hint of stubble on Radcliffe's face during one shot and a subtle hint of romance between Weasley and Granger, played by a 12 year-old. The larger cast read like a who's who of the British film industry with the likes of Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh doing a turn as the Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, Maggie Smith as colleague Minerva McGonagall, the late Richard Harris as head teacher Albus Dumbledore, traditional heavy Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Scots favourite Robbie Coltrane as  Rubeus Hagrid, former Monty Python star John Cleese as the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly-Headless Nick, and Educating Rita star Julie Walters as Molly Weasley.

Apart from a house elf, a screaming Mandrake weed, Oh and not to mention the Eight Legged Freaks and a tree cinematically reminiscent of Poltergiest; there were no real exciting moments in the movie to rival the first. I guess that's why there was no sequels to E.T. or Willy Wonka. Of course if you are to create a character for recurring storylines take a leaf out of the Indiana Jones and James Bond movies.

Besides, the slave elf 'Dobby' was fit with people's expecting even though it was too big I expected. These was pretty enough to satisfy people. But the movie was not as pretty satisfy as I expected. I think the director pretended to make the movie only for children. The monster snake looked like just a big Anaconda and some children's acting was not good enough to cover the movie.

The story has Harry returning to Hogwarts, older, smarter, and edgier, and thus the film is darker and more gritty, as Harry faces the fact that he might yet have no small amount of darkness in him. Though this is lamentably Harris' last film, his Dumbledore is remarkable and is one of his finer works (and that is no small task in and of itself). Though it is not without flaws (Where did Branagh go? Rickman as Snape occurred all too little in this one, though his screen time was remarkably well spent).

It was a lot darker and more thrilling than the first one, and unlike the first movie, some elements are actually scary, like the giant spiders (an animal I hate with all my soul) and the basilisk. All of the characters are well-portrayed, and you can see that the boy's voices have changed quite a bit. You could already notice Daniel Radcliffe's voice changing in the Philosopher's Stone, but here, it is deep all the time. Rupert Grint's voice has also changed quite a bit, a little deeper, and crackling (he's actually 14 years old by the way) and Tom Felton seems a lot taller and meaner than the first one (Tom Felton is 15 by the way). Emma Watson also seems to have grown into a more mature young woman. All of the other characters from the first one were also good (I enjoyed Richard Harris's last performance, I'm really going to miss him), but I was deeply amazed by the new coming actors. Kenneth Branagh is a real scene-stealer as Professor Lockhart, so is Dobby the house-elf, and Moaning Myrtle, but I believe the best performance came from Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. I'm glad they didn't change the score from the first one, and the settings are still amazing. The visual effects are again amazing (although I do wish they had made some scenes shorter).

I guess I can't blame the director, based on the book with which he had to work. The Chamber of Secrets was a good movie, it just lacked the joy and delight of the first. I prefer fantasy movies to be fun. The characters were fleshed out quite a bit more, but that is to be expected when they are seen the second time around. There is no way the topic should be treated as anything but fun, it's young magicians after-all. I suspect the books and movies that follow will be darker and more serious, therefore less enjoyable to me.",1

Again the Adult actors and actresses deliver wonderful performances. Richard Harris' Dumbledore is back and better than ever. Looking more comfortable in his role.

The general humor of the first film also was spot on..not too cheesy and overbearing, but not understated either. The drawback of the first film though, I felt, was the general lack of suspense. The build up to the mystery of the S's S was a bit lacking and when time came for the three heroes to search the school cellar, I was a little bit less than riveted. Also, the final showdown between HP and umm.....that guy :) , I felt was a bit anti- climactic and a tad bit nonsensical( why even get within skin to skin contact rage w/ Harry? cast a spell and be done with it!).

Despite the obvious aging and cracking voices of Ron and Harry, the acting has not improved the slightest bit. Neither has anything really, which is quite pathetic because the point of a sequel is to improve. I just didn't but any of it. The CGI car was the dumbest thing to do, even when it was still the car didn't look real. The adult performances are uninspired and ripoffs of past performances in children's movies. The plot suffers because it does not really move us any farther in the story, instead when we're finished we're pretty much back where we started, Ginnie is back to normal, no one really seems to think anything of the fact that she was the heir of Slytherin, and Harry fights a ""copy"" of Voldemort. I can't really see why Harry returned after his last ordeal in the first one, and the fact that he's returning the third year proves his I.Q. and shoe size are the same. Has he not caught on by now that every year he goes there, someone tries to kill him? And later on in the series people actually die! Lucius Malfoy ran at Mr. Potter with a drawn sword and a house elf managed to stop him?!?! Can anyone explain the logic behind this? Malfoy was a death eater, do you mean to tell me any one of these guys can be put on their backs by an insecure, masochist little elf? Not to mention I think Harry would tell someone that Luscious Malfoy just attempted to murder him. Don't waste your money on this movie, read the book if you insist on knowing what happens in Harry Potter, but as I said before the plot doesn't do anything to move you forward so you may as well skip it altogether.

One thing bugs me about that game Harry plays. If catching that little ""thing"" that Harry always does wins the game, then why do they keep score for the other balls if they don't matter?

The writer did another admirable job of condensing events without losing too much, though again some fairly big scenes were left out (hopefully included on the dvd).  The soundtrack was a bit much at times but nowhere near as overbearing as with Sorcerer's Stone.  My biggest gripe with this one was the ending.  It just seemed to drag very badly, and when they had the big welcome home for Hagrid everything ground to an ungainly halt.

People are overwhelmed by everyday technology and scientific theories so that they are over ""rationalised"". Movies like The Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter present a world that is very opposite : Elves , Ghosts , witches , etc... It allows them to escape into a world where anything is possible , where everything is felt and nothing is rational. In a world where god is replaced by a theory , this is a human phenomenom.

With a film this long, we expect a rewarding climax, although such is not a requisite for a good movie. Fast-paced, so almost boredom-free. Wisley's expressions are sometimes over-acting already. Some lines are unnecessary and felt stupid. Still largely a kiddy movie. The CGI are hi-tech (but not flawless) but they feel forced, exagerrated, amplified, worst, done without passion.

Okay, enough rhetoric....I liked but did not love this ""Harry Potter"". Solid performances all around (and yes, Rupert Grint's mugging is starting to annoy me).  Brilliant CGI work on the elf, spiders and giant snake.

Hermione is as childlishly practical (although not as cute) as the first film. Radcliffe shows loads of improvement in his acting abilities (he was somewhat cheesy in the first film, but to a certain extent it's hard not to be in a film like these films) My favorite scene is the sequence where Tom Riddle shows Harry his capture of Hagrid. The greyscale brownish look is very effective (although I think they should have cast someone besides Harris to play young Dumbledore, and perhaps dubbed in his voice later.)

In the first film the color of the film is golden and bright, while in this one is a darker color and the brightness has been considerably diluted. Columbus said in a documentary about the making of this movie that the cinematography here was darker, because it suited the feel and environment of the story much better. In the first one everything is bright because we are getting to see Hogwarts for the first time, and it helps the audience fall in love with the school just like Harry. While in the second one we are already comfortable with the surroundings so things get darker because we see a darker side of Hogwarts that we didn't see in the first one.

In other words, the performances failed to engage me.  However, I was impressed that the film reflected the dark tone of the book, which could have been very easily glossed over by the studio who hopes to profit.  The action sequences are appropriately intense, and the portion in the Dark Forest admittedly scared me to death.  The effectiveness of this and other portions of the film made it a more enjoyable experience than the first.

622,,"As an avid Harry Potter-fan, my expectations for this movie were high even though 'Chamber of Secrets' is my least favourite of the four published books. But CoS the movie works very, very well indeed  a nice step up in quality from 'Philosopher's Stone'. Whereas the first movie  for all its charm and freshness  had to cover so many different aspects of Harry Potter's life and his magical world that it sometimes gave the impression of being assembled by a row of different scenes which didn't always fit well together, the structure and overall aim has been greatly improved in CoS. Since this is a sequel, we can disperse with all the explanations and introductions to the magical world and go straight to the plot (which, in fact, strongly resembles the plot of the first book/movie: something evil is going on at Hogwarts, and it is up to our three heroes to figure out what it is and how to stop it). But the story works better in CoS, mainly because the film constantly moves forward  all the scenes serve a purpose, and they are sowed perfectly together. Sure, there are some omissions, but nothing significant in the overall plot is missing. Add to that some greatly enhanced special effects (mostly noticed in the Quidditch match) and an improved group of child actors, and the result can only be a success.",0
623,,"Yes, the effects and the direction are better, but Chamber of Secrets is not in a different league from the first movie  it's a pleasant diversion. The best addition to this film is Jason Isaacs as the odious Lucius Malfoy, who out-Rickmans Rickman as an aristocratic villain. He's a formidable presence, with ice-blue eyes matched by ice-blond shoulder-length hair, a man who can ooze disdain, virility and polish with equal aplomp. For the rest: Brannagh is right on the money as Lockhart. Harris, Smith, Rickman and Coltrane are back in good form here, though we see less of latter three, and it's sad to notice how much weaker Richard Harris is. It's fun to watch the young actors growing up -- if Emma Watson continues to grow prettier with each picture, look out! I don't know if Daniel Radcliffe has grown on me, or if he's actually better in this movie. Like others, I found him unexpressive & limited in the earlier picture, which I thought Rupert Grint walked away with. Ron seems a bit goofier this time around, & we sadly see less of Hermione. Overall, Chamber of Secrets isn't more than an entertaining installment, and as that it satisfies.",1
624,,"Jeez, what a crummy movie.  I just didn't realize people had this much free time.  Next time I want to waste two hours of my life.

625,7.0,"I first saw the Harry Potter films on television during the seven-day marathon (Deathly Hallows I watched both films in one day) and after watching the first film (which was very good for me) I saw the second film and I could notice that it was the same director (as opposed to the third that was darker than the first two), the film was childish , innocent, naïve, as entertaining as it should be given that the literary template is the same. But unlike the first film the second is longer and has a more complex plot, the very path to Hogwarts is quite long, there are some books through which He Who Must Not Be Named communicates with Harry Potter, some depiction that kills cats and their blood writes some creepy words on the walls, a potion with which the main heroes turn into other people, a big spider that that lovable fool Hagrid breeds , some whiny spirit (I forgeted her name) who talks about a snake and again that snake that makes the children wonder and much more. As for other newcomers, there's also Dobby who's cute and likeable, but can be incredibly toxsic, especially when banging her head in the closet. By the quality of the film is there somewhere like the original, therefore, the level of entertainment is still very high, should be watched.",1
626,9.0,"Saw the movie last night.  I like the three kids, they are maturing on stage and off.  Lucius Malfoy is perfect.  Not enough time spent in the class room and the Basilisk wasn't as well done as I had hoped.  Dobby was good, as were all the CGIs.  I knew that this would be a darker movie, and it was.  I am worried that Azkaban will need to be 3.5 hours, so maybe an intermission will be in order.  Anyway, I think the movie is worth it, and in some ways (acting, mostly), better than the first.  Can't get enough of the Weasley family.",1
627,,`HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SICRET.',0
628,5.0,"I think that the main reason that I did not like this movie as much as the first, is that I had read the book first. Between the time I had seen the first movie, and Chamber of Secrets, I had read all 4 Harry Potter books. Sitting in the theater on opening day, I think the main problem was that I already knew what was going on. There were no surprises for me. Everything was pretty much as it happened in the book. I had not read Scorceror's Stone before I saw the movie, so what happened in that movie was more of a surprise.",0
629,5.0,"Less disappointing compared to the previous one (The Sorcerer's Stone), however I continue finding this movie lame and scenario lacks of rationalism.

However, it is decent film that is fun to watch with Grint again giving the best performance.  Branagh and Coulson close seconds.  Both owned the parts wholly. I am sad that again Columbus missed some of the finer points about the characters, especially the Weasly family and their importance.  Too much effort with the ""action"" rather than the story which is truly unnecessary and often unbelievable, such as the Quiditch match that missed much of the point of it and put the story action out of view of the characters for us the audiences sake. Wonderful art direction and cinematography, but still lacking in the emotion of the books.",1

I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next book and the third movie.",1
634,,"People have been saying this is better than the last instalment, and they're right. But it's still only average. I could write a small book on the stupid plot problems of this film (although many are also problems with the book). SPOILERS. If Harry has an invisibility cloak, why do he and Ron need to disguise themselves to get information out of anybody? Can't they just follow them around? If the first victim of the basilisk wasn't killed or injured (and it didn't even kill a squidding cat - I'm so scared), where did the blood which was painted on the wall come from? Why wasn't the phoenix affected by the basilisk's gaze, and wasn't it convenient when Tom Riddle TOLD Harry it had been blinded? Wasn't it great how Tom Riddle EXPLAINED everything to Harry? Convenient also how Harry was able to pull a sword we'd not previously been told about out of the hat - he'd have been completely screwed otherwise. Phew. How come no-one else could hear the basilisk hissing from the pipes if Harry could hear it well enough to understand?",1

When I saw The Chamber of Secrets, I was very much afraid of a similar disgrace on J.K. Rowling's masterpiece. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. The actors have grown-up and into their roles, giving th acting a more believable edge, and the film was much closer to what it should be. The only disapointment was not incredibly terrible - I thought that the basilisk looked not enough like a snake and too much like a dragon without legs.  But all in all, I believe that I enjoyed this movie more than I did the book itself.",1

I needed a deeper story to hold the scenes together (most of the scenes individually were great, but they just didn't get).

648,7.0,"As an older Harry Potter fan who has read the books, i found ""The Chamber of Secrets"" to be enjoyable, but a bit of a let-down after the ""The Sorcerer's Stone."" I understand that the story is far more complicated than the first book, but i do not believe that an appropriate compromise was reached between the mystery and the details of Harry's childhood. It seems as though, not only were the details of the mystery insufficient, but that Harry's coming-of-age has been almost completely ignored. However, in spite of some very bad acting from Draco Malfoy, there are plenty of exciting moments and the movie is fun throughout. They should look into replacing Malfoy as the new Dumbledore is chosen. It would be an added incentive to see the third movie. 7 out of 10 (for a potter fan)",1

652,8.0,"I quiet enjoyed the second Harry Potter Movie, personally I liked the first one better, but it had to do more with the story than the movie itself. The chamber of secrets was my least favorite Harry Potter book. There were some improvements in the movie itself the acting was better and the visual effects more realistic. My only complaint was not with the film but with the classification it belong to. When I watched the film there were a couple of kids around the age of 7-10 and they were terrified during the movie. Scenes with giant snakes and giant spiders are a little too much for young children. Parent who are not familiar with Harry Potter can bring young children to the movies causing endless weeks of nightmares. I hope that for the next two Harry Potters the movies become PG 13 specially for the Goblet of Fire where one of the students dies. Overall a very nice film 8/10",1
653,,"As with it's predecessor, this film is fantastic (in all meanings of the word). This is one of those rare films where a sequel meets or exceeds the film it succeeds.",1
654,9.0,"Wow! What an improvement in every way over ""The Sorcerer's Stone!"" At first I was a little ambivalent that this film would be essentially a rehash of what happened in the first film, and indeed that is the case, but it helps to examine the nature of the universe and characters created in the first film and ties it in extremely well to the films that follow. More specifically I am referring to how this movie was essentially designed just to provide more character insight into the connection between Harry and Voldemort. Whereas we encountered the ""real"" Voldemort in ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" as essentially a parasite living off of Professor Quirrell, here we have a ""copy,"" a virtual Voldemort created when he was a student named Tom Riddell 50 years ago. The copy has all of the knowledge and memories of the Voldemort in the present but retains the form of the past and even tries to ""become more than a memory."" Not only is this a highly innovative way to flesh out the arch villain's backstory but it also provides greater motivation for his rebellion years ago and for his return two years later. Both of these two movies have the same plot really which is setting up the background and personality of a boy wizard prodigy who comes to learn more about himself through the attempts of his nemesis, Voldemort, to seek revenge. This movie posits Voldemort on a more realistic playing field and yet with the most creative of devices, that of the virtual becoming the real, which then allows for the revelation that Voldemort rubbed off some of his powers on Harry. Is Harry then another more complex copy of Voldemort we wonder? They certainly do have a connection, mutually attracting and repulsing one another, tied by history and circumstances, and yet divided by alternative perceptions of this connection. Voldemort derives his view of the world from his abilities, an ideology akin to predestination, while Harry has defined himself by his actions, his choices, not by any predetermined role that he must play because of the innate tools which he has been given. Philosophically, the ideas are far richer than in the first film. It is as if Columbus remade the same plot only with new scenarios better connected thematically. The complexity of the ideas presented in this film are so far beyond that of typical kids fare, and I can see why fans of all ages are intrigued by this franchise on so many levels. ",1
655,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is n absolutely fantastic movie in every facet. The main movie is very faithful to the book and the extended version is extremely faithful to the book. The main movie covers everything of importance to the plot in pretty much the same order as the book and the extended versions keeps even more elements, some of which improve how well the extended version captures the emotional depth of Harry's story. Daniel and Emma have shaken off their noviceness and show great acting improvement in their portrayals of the main roles as compared to Sorcerer's Stone. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine are still fantastic as Snape and Hagrid. Sadly, this is our last of Richard Harris as Dumbledore as he died before this film was even released. Harris was clearly the better Dumbledore and captured the wisdom and grandfatherly mentor of the Dumbledore from the books so well. Then the new cast members are fantastic. In particular, Jason Issacs was PERFECT in the role of Lucius and brought out the ruthlessness and self supposed superiority. The pacing is good. While there are some ""slow"" parts, this is a story that some parts need to be slow in. This movie does a fantastic job of being slow in parts in which the story calls for it, such as when Professor McGonagall is explaining the legend of the Chamber of secrets to the class, and faster paced in parts that call for it, such as the Flying Car scene. The special effects/visuals are massively improved over Sorcerer's Stone. This is particularly obvious in creatures. As opposed to the cartoonish Fluffy and comical troll seen in SS, Aragog is truly scary, Fawkes is truly awe striking, and Dobby feels like a real character. And the set of the Chamber of Secrets itself is much more well done than the chess set and dungeons seen at the climax of SS. Another major plus is that this story, both book and movie, though it retains a strong child appeal element with things like Howlers and Flying Cars it is far less childish than SS and has more emotional depth. The story of people like Hermione, who are looked down upon because of their parentage/background adds more of an emotional twist to the story, as does the danger they face. This leads to another point: There is real danger and real tension in this movie. The tension between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle is palpable and becomes even more palpable when Tom reveals that he is Lord Voldemort. And whereas in SS it really felt all along as though everything would be okay and Harry would triumph, in COS there is a real feeling of danger and a real feeling of doubt as to whether Harry will be able to save Ginny, whether Harry will defeat Tom Riddle, and even whether Harry will survive the adventure in the Chamber of Secrets. A final point is that John Williams fantastic music. The awesomeness of this speaks for itself. I really enjoyed the piece on the DVD where they showed the scene of Hermione's return with the music removed. The scene feels far less fulfilling without music and it was interesting to hear Williams himself talk about this. This movie should not be viewed by preschoolers or kindergarteners because of emotional intensity (Hermione's petrification, the message on the wall about Ginny.) as well scary moments, such as the Aragog scene and the battle in the Chamber of Secrets itself. This movie is perfectly fine for kids in 3rd grade and older. For kids in grades 1-2 in depends on the individual. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an outstanding movie that earns its 10 out of 10. Make sure to see the extended version at least a few times.",1

Short of remaking the first two episodes while the kids are young enough to pass as 11 year-olds, there is only one hope.

But as the director Chris Columbus said in an article earlier( cant rememeber which one) this movie was a lot better than the first. And i must completely agree with him. It had it all comedy, drama, even a foreshadow of Romance ( you'll see what i mean) and a lot of Action. In some ways it was better than the book because annoying characters were very humoruosly shown and in a lot of ways that helped the movie. The only problem i had with it is the same problem i had with the first one, the storyline is a little choppy. Nonetheless Chris Columbus makes up for it by stretching his wings and adding to the movie a bit of his own flair, which it did need some of. My only caution is that parents when you take your kids to see it be VERY careful. It was given a PG rating but there were a few scenes that definently qualify in the PG-13 category.  Still the movie was very cool. And a lot more believable i mean the special affects were so much better in this one.

680,6.0,"As a rabid Harry Potter fan, I eagerly awaited this movie and I couldn't help but be disappointed. Naturally, since I've devoured all of the books, I had some ideas about how this movie should be and, as a result, came away feeling let down. It can't be said enough that the casting of these movies is masterful. Snape was never a particular favorite of mine and although I initially felt that Alan Rickman was miscast, he soon did away with all of my apprehensions. He is masterful as Snape. With the simple curl of a lip or a subtle change in the slant of his eyebrow, he can convey the sinister nature of Snape and his expressions are every bit as inscrutable as the Snape from the books. It was a pleasure to see that Rickman was not the only wonderful cast member to return. The actors do a wonderful job of really inhabiting their characters and the child actors have grown since the previous movie. The fact that they're the same actors helps maintain the continuity that is so important to the HP works as a whole. Not only are Harry and his friends growing in the books, so are the actors who portray them. Another very strong point of this movie was Dobby, a character I loved in the books. In spite of his odd and rather ugly appearance, there is something sweet and endearing about him. He's loyalty personified--even though he can be a pain in the rear. His voice was wonderful too and it was such a treat to see him move from the page and into ""real"" life. Jason Isaacs is another welcome addition to the cast of characters and he infuses Lucius Malfoy with cold, elegant menace. He's every bit as intimidating as Snape but with a thin veneer of charm and elegance. Isaacs really made the character come to life for me. Yet in spite of all this, what I sorely missed in this movie was the delicious humor that permeated nearly every page of the book. I've long felt that Chamber of Secrets is the funniest of the HP books but much of the humor was stripped from the movie in order to move the plot along. I felt that this did the story a disservice as humor so often proves such a saving grace in Harry's world.",1

696,9.0,Another solid movie from Chris Columbus. He did well with these early small books and they suited his style well. One thing I didn't mention on my previous review is how great all of the casting for this series is. Even the smaller parts like Filch are played to perfection. Yes some of the kids are still learning but I don't think they're that bad and the adults are really the cream of British actors.,1
697,,"This was a great movie, why? Because it catches the book perfectly, how? It follows the book religiously. Yet we get some user critics complaining it `was a bit flat' or `I didn't like this portrayal' I also notice that the critics that rate this movie low, have the comments `I haven't read the book _ _ _ _'. Well that's the point, the movie is biased on a CHILDRENS book, therefore it is not an original screenplay. One reviewer actually suggested changes!!! If the film makers had made the film any different there would have been howls from here to Timbuktu. My first suggestion is to some of the User critics, don't be so picky. My 2nd suggestion Read the Book, See the Movie, you would appreciate the whole experience more.",1

And when portraying Donny, the CGI of the film is even greater than ever in that 2002 era.<br /><br />Also, the film is also the longest one within all HP series and personally I like the long film because I can enjoy watching it on my bed when I was 14 and it felt pretty good.",1

I didn't think it captured the engaging magic of Harry Potter and his friends - and his world, and his life.  This movie gets it.  Maybe it is because the foundation was laid with Sorcerer's Stone. Maybe it's because it is a better movie.  This movie gives an excellent story to those who do not read the books, as well as a few winks and smiles to those of us who have read them.",1

The acting is better this time, and you can tell that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are much more comfortable in their roles.  The adult actors are excellent as well, and the story flows smoothly enough that those not familiar with the book can still follow it closely enough.  The problem is that the story isn't just told...it's driven down your throat.",1
714,10.0,"Christoper Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a far cry from the preceding Harry Potter movie. For this time, a more fearful mystrey awaits the willing youngsters from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus' witty ideas, the musical score, and the realistic-like visual effects brings true magic to the screen. Also the acting has taken a sharp turn from Sorcere's Stone, the players have grown and taken these films to a more proffesional level.Even John Williams' musical score will keep you in complete suspense as you sit on the edge of your seat. Although the new movie has a more frightening touch it has the audience anxiously waiting to gasp and gaze at the impressive dramatics of the big screen. With a new approach to the special effects, the movie franchise has introduced a greater excitement in scenes such as the Quidditch game, Aragog's lair, and The Chamber of Secrets. Chris Columbus takes a new perspective on the movie, as he draws away from JK Rowling's literary works. Subtle changes have been made in the movie and have finally created a comfortable enviorment for the wizarding world. The new action sequenes may be quite scary to children below the age of seven, but the tasteful violence will enthrall young audiences as for older ones too. The transition from the first to second movie is smooth,not like a choppy pass on such as The Mummy Returns. This masterpiece deserves much praise for the hard work for the cast and crew, yet there are times when there is not enough background information for one to fully understand the Potter history. This movie will take anyone to hights in the Weasley's flying Ford Angila, and take one to the spooky depths of salazar's chamber. Harry Potter fans will leave not disappointed to the least bit, and ordinary muggles will return with a drop of magical blood in them, for they have been to Hogwarts... and back. (A+_crazykoura)",1

718,,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's not as good as the book, but I think it is much better than the Philosopher Stone. It has more funny moments than the first, and it is much scarier. The special effects are absolutely brilliant. Specially the spider-scene and the scene in the chamber were absolutely stunning. I also loved the scenes with Gilderoy Lockhart. He is my most favourite character of the book and Kenneth Branagh does a wonderful job playing him. Also the acting of our three young hero's has improved. They are all three very good but I specially loved Rupert Grint during the ""Spider-scene"". He is really good in looking en sounding very scared. I didn't like the fact that Alan Rickman hasn't so much to do in this movie. I really enjoy his perfect evilness when he playes Snape. I did love the guy that played Lucius Malvoy (I can't remember his name) and I also loved Dobby. Also the rest of the cast is perfect. I felt really sorry when I heard of the death of Richard Harris. I think it's going to be quite diffecult to cast a prefect Dumbledore (like he was) for the next movies. Also the fact that director Chris Colombus is stepping out, makes me wonder how the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is going to be. I hope it's going to be just as good, or better (for I think Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best book of the four) than this one. At last I really like to note than some scenes (especially the spider-scene and the scene in the chamber) are just too scary for small children.",1

It is a great adaption of the book and once again the actors did a terrific job.

The whole feel of this film is dark and creepy and the visual effects in it are better than the first and the most creepiest bit for me was the spiders as i am scared to death of them.

723,6.0,"Night 2 of my 4 night Harry Potter week! Each time I view these movies, I kick myself that I have not read the books... One of these days... The basic plot is that Harry Potter enters Hogwart's for his 2nd year, even though he is warned not to come back! The adventures start even before he gets to Hogwart's, and continues on as he and his friends try to find the ""Chamber of Secrets"". The movie is a bit darker than the 1st with scary spiders, students being petrified, and one large basilisk slithering around. It is interesting to see the character growth of the actor's, plus their own growth in real time. Harry and Ron a looking a bit older than their ""12 years""... Malfoy is back, and even better is the introduction of his father, Lucius Malfoy, played by Jason Isaacs. One of my favorite ""bad-guy"" actors. Ever seen ""The Patriot""! Kenneth Branagh is also new as Professor Lockhart, a pompous, self-obsessed new wizard. A different take for the usual serious dramatic actor. And Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are once again great, but I wish they had more screen time. And it is very sad to see that Richard Harris will no longer be with us as Dumbledore. Such a loss of a great actor! Now rating the 2 disc widescreen DVD: Disc 1 has the movie, plus 2 trailers ( one current and one for Year One). There is also the cast/crew lineup, which once again, I wish they would go a bit more in depth. Disc 2 is great! There are 19 additional scenes. Some good like extended scenes of the ""horror"" shop, a scene with Lockhart, and talking about the ""heir"" in study hall. Some were very...huh? ""Behind the Hogwarts"" has an interview with JK Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Very good! Also, there is ""Dumbledore's Office"" which has the making of Dumbledore's office and the greenhouse scene, and a tour of the office. The making of the office was a great docu with a lot of wow moments on how they put everything together. There is also various interviews with the cast. Some good and some bad. I wish Isaac's, Rickman's and Coltrane's were longer, as they are genuine funny people. Overall, another great Harry Potter movie in the series, and a great DVD! Highly worth buying and adding to the home collection!",1

Many of those (and other) scenes simply added length to the movie without providing anything new except to show that HP has a huge xf budget.

Movies are generally not as good as the books they were adapted from, but Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was fun. This sequel wasn't. The only highlights I can point out are performances by Alan Rickman, Kenneth Brannagh and (surprisingly!) Tom Felton. Eye candy for the little ones but anyone over 18 who has read the book, shouldn't go in expecting to be blown away. I guess, the reason this movie cashed in less at the box-office is as simple as it's not as good as the first one...",1
732,,"This makes me wonder what all the fuss is about, I have only read the first book, the first movie was less then steller. Okay, what Rowling did to create Harry Potter, take Scooby Doo or Nacy Drew for that matter, some bad guys from Mythology and other creatures that have been done a million times before and plug it into a semi-gothic wizard school and you have Harry Potter. The storyline is beyond predictable, well it is ment for children. The first 30 minutes are great, but then after that it drags, on and on and on and on and on. Seemingly for no real reason, this is the type of stuff that would work as a saturday morning cartoon. Harry is a BORING main character, Ron is okay, Hermonie (or however you spell her name) is just down right annoying. But there is not one orignal idea in this movie, not one, yah see most fantasy novels have at least one thing unique to it, (LOTR has Hobbits, InuYasha has well InuYasha , and Spirited Away had Aku and a Spirit Bath house with many crazy looking creatures) What does Harry Potter have? A bunch of characters you have seen time and time again in hundreds of other things. Although cute, cut it down about one hour and it might be worth watching. The storyline is empty without depth or a focused end, it just plods along. The storyline is also WAY to dark for some younger children and to plotless for many adults.",0

So I had to drive 40 miles to get to the nearest theater which is a old one totally renovated in Houlton Maine.It was a 1:00 PM Saturday matinee sold out of course, with hundreds - or so it seemed -of children. I wondered if I was going to see any of the Movie. I was shocked to see how quiet everyone was with gasps and sighs where they should be. The movie is simply great. The cast is simply superb. What a shame that we will not be able to enjoy Mr.Harris again. He was simply marvelous.When it ended I was surprised and actually disappointed it did not run longer. I was also impressed with the number of families that had come from Canada to view this film.It is safe to say that everyone simply loved it. Don't miss it.",1
736,,"""Chamber of Secrets"" was definitely better than ""Philosopher's Stone"" for one obvious reason. The special effect. The most apparent one was the quidditch match, where the competition between Harry and Draco seemed a lot more natural compared to the first movie.",1
737,,"After a wonderful introduction produced by the first movie, i was a bit dissapointed to see very little improvement in almost every area. Granted i do enjoy reading the books written by JK rowling but i am a little shocked at what it seems to have very little effort to capture the true identity of each charater. I personally think its not necessarly the actors and actress's fault but more the script let them down by not being more about all the characters ( even the minor ones). The movie tends to revolve around harry,ron and hermoine and yes they are the main charaters but i feel that some of the minor characters need to be shown more so we can learn more about them. For example, our two practical jokers Fred and George weasly. allowing them to have more lines would definetly spice up the movie a bit. Also Ginny weasly, she is becoming more of a character who's not quite so shy but kind of a bad girl inside and i hope in the future movies we see this side come out. Also Lee Jordan, he is a funny joker to since he hangs around w/the twins and finally neville longbottom. I feel that the tension between the houses are exposed a little to much as well. Other than that it has promise and it is rather entertaining for all you HP fans.",1
738,7.0,"After going back and rewatching the entire franchise...Chamber of Secrets has remained my least favorite of the 8. Too be fair: it's still decent. Like all the films in this franchise, even in its weaknesses it still has a charm, plus it and lays a lot of solid groundwork for the following films (where most would agree the franchise really picks up). However Chamber of Secrets was at a point in the series where it was stuck in the middle of a tone, not quite committing as a movie for little kids...but also not committing as a movie for adults. Again, they strike that balance MUCH better in the films preceding.",1
739,6.0,"Ok. Year is 2002 and I am nine years old. As a nine years old boy, I can say this is a good extension of Harry Potter movie. But! I am 27 years old, at the moment, and I can say it could be better extension, and here is why. I posted a pretty positive and optimistic comment for Harry Potter 1, with the hope that its second extension will be if nothing else as good as the first one. But that did not happen. I'm not strict and sarcastic, but I think I'm pretty realistic. I would start with the only thing that I think is the same as in the case of my reviewing of Harry Potter 1 and that is the plot of the film written by JKR. She is the only one who has maintained continuity in terms of quality and JKR once again gave us the opportunity to hang out with wizards and enjoy the world of magic and she did it masterfully which was worth recording another part. Of all the Harry Potter books, I read this one and of course I felt that bitter taste when the film fails to justify the quality of the book, which is the case in most cases. When we speak about choice of actors, whether it is the setting from the first part of the film or whether it is the new actors who appear in this part, the choice is again good. The wonderful symbiosis of the entire cast was noticed in this sequel to the film.<br /><br />For my personal taste inserting the character of Professor Lockhart was unnecessary. Maybe it could be someone who is not a coward but a person who is more serious. I think that would gain in seriousness from the plot itself and strengthen the legend of Harry Potter himself. Costumes, audio and visual effects and animations are outstanding in this sequel to the film. One of the bad things about the film is the impoverished dialogues and predictable situations that seem to be adapted to children, which later resulted in the overall impression of the film being somehow more amateurish than professional. That is, it is as if the film was made for a younger age, discriminating against older viewers. In some parts, where a more serious level of drama and mystery is necessary, the situation is resolved by inserting an element of comedy, which greatly undermines the dramatic seriousness of the film, which is not good at all. I'll take the example of a scene where Harry fights a vicious snake, at the end of the film where Tom Riddle stands petrified as in some weird video game and tells us what happens in scenes as mystical as the one when a phoenix enters and blinds a snake. In that scene, the level of seriousness collapses both when the phoenix flies out of nowhere and the door is closed, and when he heals Harry's wounds with his tears. You will notice that in just 60 seconds Harry says goodbye to young Ginny and tells her that everything will be fine with him and that everything is over. Totally amateurish in my opinion. There are a lot of such scenes and that is what leaves the viewers with the impression of bitter taste because the book was quite mystical and serious and did not deserve to be superficially screened by the film. In order not to go any further, I would like to point out once again that the film did not justify the expectations of the audience in general, but only provided pleasure in the domain of that, and that year we enjoyed the magical world of Harry Potter. A lot of dramatic seriousness was needed, a longer duration of uncertainty and mystery and the elimination of unnecessary staff, as well as their replacement with more serious and complicated staff that keep us in suspense until the very end. I will take another concrete example. The snake that Harry Potter kills was described at the end of the whole film as a monster that everyone is afraid of, and when it appeared, it died faster than it appeared. Too fast and unused by the director. But well, maybe it is possible to characterize all this as the best for that time and that level of technological development of cinematography. My rating is 6/10. We are waiting for the next sequel.",1

From the word go, you do not stop smiling until the scene where Harry is doing Lockharts fanmail.  Such jokes will not be forgotten: 'I didn't know you could read.'  Eroll flying splat into the Window, and Harry's face when he realises he has to travel through Floo Powder. So many funny moments, however, when the plot takes over it can start to drag and get a bit boring, for those who have read the books anyway. Dobby, Fawkes and the Basilisk were absolutely brilliant and the adult cast are again the perfect cast. Daniel Radcliffe, although a better performance than the first movie (which isn't hard), was still making me and other adults around me let out a snigger when he delivers a bad line 'Of course, Phoenix's have healing powers'.  I don't know how anyone can say he can act. Emma Watson was brilliant, as she was in the first movie, and the Mudblood scene was most touching because of her performance and Robbie Coltranes. Rupert Grint and his annoying but brilliant facial expressions are back, he takes the show away from Danial Radcliffe which isn't hard.  He is so much more believable than he was in the first movie. Kenneth Brannagh was absolutely perfect as Gilderoy Lockhart!  That's all I have to say about that! The performance I was most disappointed with, which was Daniel in the first movie, was this time round Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy.  Maybe it was his voice that let him down or the way he looked frightenly like Eminem at one point before delivering a terrible line 'Good one Goyle'.  Whatever it was, he was terrible this time round and was much better as the puberty-less Draco in the first film. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape was underused as well as Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall.  Shame.",1
749,9.0,"Overall, watching the film was an enjoyable experience.  Since I read the book a few times before I saw the movie, it seemed very short.  The actors all gave brilliant performances.  I think that Mark Williams was perfect for Arthur Weasley.  The major flaw of the film was that key moments from the book were sacrificed for the sake of the ""action packed"" scenes. In all four books Rowling gives sublte hints about what is really going on. Unfortunately some of these subtle hints were cut out.  I'd mentions them, but that would be a spoiler.  However the acting was brilliant.  Daniel Radcliff was born to play Harry.  He has a wonderful, quirky smile. Ruprit Grint was brilliant as Ron.  He had me rolling on the floor.  And Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione.  She is great at keeping the boys in line. I thought that Ginny, Percy, and Snape were seriously underused in the film, I hope to see more of them in the deleted scenes on the DVD.",1

I felt with the job he did and the credit he began with in the first movie he should have his own room/office/laboratory. The first movie also lacked full information on why everyone knew him as if he was reincarnated, these could have been added here too instead of the constant mention of his scar. All in all I stil enjoyed the movie but as a young at heart adult would like more of to the storyline.

760,6.0,"This movie is 2 and a half hours long and feels like less than an hour, this is both good and bad as I can happily watch this film over and over again but it also means its quite forgettable and fails to really make an impact. That being said this is a great sequel and many of the things that made Philosopher's Stone good is carried onto this one. Where this movie falls short in my opinion, is the plot. Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes, particularly the action ones, are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning. He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors, who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting. Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying, overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first. Likewise, he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes, especially action scenes like the car scenes, the spider scene, and even the final encounter between Harry and the Basilisk and they come off as overlong and particularly flat. The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him, Chris Columbus seems intent on making the film a magical version of a school where kids merrily skip around solving problems, like in Scooby Doo.",0

The gap year certainly aged them, as they would in the film, and indeed adds to the authenticity. Although  the four main parts (harry, ron, hermione and draco) all put in better displays - Rupert Grints` Ron Weasly performance was very good indeed - is there anyone better, anywhere to vomit slugs with such pathos ! - Excellent, as I, with most of the cinema, was laughing so loud, we were crying.

768,8.0,"To understand the success of the Harry Potter series of books it is important to take a look at the style and layout of the story as it is written JK Rowling.  To quote Ron from the books `Bloody brilliant' is about all I can say.  Each book has one major story arc which is told in series of short stories.  It just so happens that each short story or story arc is a chapter long.  In `Chamber of Secrets' the over all story arc about the Heir of Slytherin is divided into eighteen short arcs with each chapter bringing the reader closer to the climax of the story and the final chapter to tie up all the loose ends. In the first movie Chris Columbus and Steven Kloves follow this successful story telling technique pretty well with the movie divided up into several short stories all tied together by Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with he-who-shall-not-be-named.  The problem with this kind of story telling is that it does not translate as well from the printed page to the big screen.  (I had hoped the first DVD would have more of the deleted scenes inserted back into the movie)  Well the first movie had several good attributes its over-all story line just wasn't one of them. Only dropping one of the short stories and shortening each short story made the story seem a little jumpy and didn't really allow for the character development that the necessary for anyone who hasn't read the book.   I liked the first movie by the way. In the second movie CC and SK move to a more traditional idea of story telling for movies rather than use the eighteen short stories from the book the movie is divided into about 10 short story arcs in which several elements of two or more chapters are joined together.  The story also elements several little pieces of the story, which while not important seem a little unnerving for them not to be there.  For example when Harry takes a wrong turn with the Floo powder we learn about the Malfoy family, yet the movie skips this part.  Traditional story telling also creates another minor glitch in terms of story telling, the individual story arcs do not seem to flow as well together in CoS as they did in SS.  The transitions are terrible; I hope that the material cut out of the film release is centered around these transitions when the DVD is released.  While the missing scenes would be nice, better transitions would make the movie more enjoyable. In the first movie I was very pleased with the acting and casting of every character except Daniel Radcliffe as Harry.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint seemed much more comfortable in the first film than Daniel did.  Emma and Rupert plus Tom Felton just were more believable.  In his portrayal of Harry in the Second move Daniel seems more comfortable to say the least.  He generally is not outclassed by the actors around him.  While some might complain about his growth spurt between the movies, it is only natural he is a young man you know and it does occur in the Book series to some extent, just not as noticeable as it is on film.  The casting of the adults (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltran, Alan Rickman, Richard Branagh, and Jason Isaacs) is too good to believe.  Each one of them fits perfectly into their rolls, as if JK Rowling had them in mind when she wrote the book. The death of Richard Harris will make it hard to fill his role as Dumbledore. However with so many characters in the movie, many characters were not given the screen time they needed to display their talents and develop their characters.  Scenes showing Ginny Weasley and the general dislike of the Malfoy family could have really tied the movie together.  Noticeable missing from the film was Zoe Wanamaker as Madam Hooch who was written out for some reason. CC has done a better job with use of Special Effects and CGI in CoS than in SS.  First each effect is less noticeable on screen (with a few exceptions) and they blend into the background this brings the story and the characters to the forefront.  There are a couple of places I wondered why the effects were not more believable, the scene with the car and the whomping willow for instance.  The tree was just too stiff and the car took too little damage. In the first movie there are only a couple of external scenes that show even parts of the school and yet in the second movie the use of panning shots of Hogwarts also fills out the school and makes it more believable for the audience. Overall the CoS is an above average film.  I still do not understand the fascination with making shorter films.  The change to a more traditional way of telling a story on the big screen helped this movie for adults and may have hurt it from holding the interest of younger children.  The young actors all seemed to have improved their performance from the first move, but I would have like to see more of Rupert Grint not being scared during the movie. For a movie that is already 160 minutes long the CoS needed to be about 18 to 30 minutes longer to fill in the story and improve the transition between the scenes.  Several interesting scenes either were cut out or left out of the script which upset the ten year old next sitting next to me in the theater.  The use of CGI and SFX were much better in CoS than in SS and it really helped bring the actors and the story to the attention of the movie. Out of Ten Stars I would give the movie 8 stars, same rating as SS but for vastly different reasons.",1

I was absolutely amazed, Chamber of Secrets went along well with the story based on the novel by J.K. Rowling, and CoS as it's informally known in the muggle world, was an incredible movie, the actors portrayed an indescribable talent boost, Daniel Radcliffe makes Harry come alive once again. Sean Biggerstaff was in more scenes, even if they were just slight glimpses of the cute Scottish keeper Oliver Wood. Rupert Grint played Ron amazingly well, his faces and his voice went from high pitched frightened to a growing boy deep. Tom Felton who played our Slytherin bad boy Draco Malfoy was much meaner and nastier, all the more lovable if you ask me. All in all, the movie was incredible, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.",1
774,,"I've been eagerly anticipating opening day for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  I saw it today and found it to be a much better film than the Sorceror's Stone.  However, it would seem to me that the director and/or screenwriter have tried to pack way too much into this film, which leaves it feeling just a little bit empty.  Too much time being spent on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's ""adventures"" and virtually ignoring daily life for the three Gryffindors. I thought the casting of Kenneth Brannagh as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was inspired, but I was disappointed with his underuse in this film.  Yet again Alan Rickman (as Severus Snape) needs to be given more to do than glare at Harry and friends.  A quick note about Dobby the house-elf as well, though nowhere near as annoying as the infamous Jar-Jar Binks, I myself pictured Dobby to be a little less creepy and a little more goofy (for lack of a better word). The performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson were much improved as they seem to be growing into these characters.  The film's effects were much improved in the second film as well.  I would love to see more of the Weasley twins as they add a lot of comic relief to the books and it would be nice to see them do so in the films as well. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good addition to the Harry Potter movie series and while a little long it's still a lot of fun to watch.  I will be most interested in how the next film turns out with it's new director as the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series so far.  However, I would definitely recommend the Chamber of Secrets as it is a much better movie than the first, not perfect but still a fun movie for all ages.",1

Had I read the books maybe I wouldn't have been surprised, but I was taken aback with Harry being back at his relative's home at the beginning.  This was a very long and tedious introduction that was essentially a rehash of the first movie, and the character of the House Elf was so reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks in his voice and enunciation that I could hardly stand it.  The movie was replete with redundancies from the first movie such as the quillage game, and I found it to be very boring to the point of almost putting me to sleep at times.

The movie continues to expand on the world of magic introduced in Sorcerer's Stone and adds an incredible storyline to it all. The story is significantly better than Sorcerer's Stone and one of the most clever in the entire series to date. The kids seem to be more comfortable in their roles now and the adults continues with their brilliance, but I must admit, it doesn't seem like any of these adult British actors have the capacity to be bad actors. Lots of new and imaginative magical items make their introduction in this film in exhilarating fashion: Polyjuice Potion, Riddle's Diary, Aragog and much, much more. The film, like the first, still lacks edginess, but that's fine, because so does the book, and I see nothing wrong with sticking to the books, especially when the books are so good and after all, these movies are made for the readers more than the casual moviegoers. I don't mind creative licensing here or there, but stick with the elements that make the book good, and the movie will be good too.

788,9.0,"After reading many of the comments listed here, It appears that many people loved this movie, wow the people that didn't like it utterly LOATHED it.  I one of the ones who enjoyed this movie, but lets take a look at some of the bad points of it. First off, there's Quidditch.  This game is questionable at best. Basically it's flying soccer on broomsticks, exept the balls fight back. This game would be perfectly logical except for one thing: There's a tiny ball (called the snitch) that flies around, and a special member of the team (called the seeker) has to try and catch it.  When he catches it, his team gets 150 points.  The game ends only when this happens.  So there's really no point to the rest of the game.  It not reasonable to assume that a team could get 160 points higher than the other team before the other team catches the snitch.  I could understand this if the game of Quidditch was used merely to test the students flying ability, but apparently this is not the case.  There's really no logic there at all.  I guess the whole Quidditch thing is aimed at 8 year old kids who can barely read or is not meant to be a logical sport, just something to move the plot forward, or sideways, or whatever.",0

Aesthetically, the film is quite stunning and succeeds in convincing me that some love has been poured into the movie. Nontheless, a film can not shine without a tight script and decent performances. The main problem however, lies with the direction of Mr Columbus who only seems to be regurgitating the 'winning' formula of the first. In it's faithfulness to the novel, the plot somehow transposes poorly on celluloid, meandering around for a good two hours. Indeed, I was left wondering - what is the Chamber of Secrets???

""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" flies out of the starting gate (in a Ford Anglia, no less!) and doesn't stop for its 2 hr 42 minute running time (Peter Jackson, take notes!).  From the opening moments of Harry and the Weasleys in the flying car, to Harry and Malfoy battling in the dueling club (did they make parcel-tongue sound cool or what?!), to Harry's confrontation with Lucious Malfoy (which had the audience I watched the film with cheering!), ""Chamber"" is thrilling, magical, and quite funny - the latter due largely in part to Rupert Grint's comic portrayal of Ron Weasley. In fact, all the kids are great in their roles; Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry with much more bravo and daring than in ""Sorceror's Stone"", and as a result, makes a quite a good action hero.  Emma Watson's character of Hermione Granger is more laid-back this time (though she doesn't really have a whole lot to do - the boys get all the great action scenes!).  And it's quite touching to see the special relationship that exists between Harry, Ron, and Hermione as played by these actors; the characters genuinely care about each other and acknowledge each others strengths.  The only flaw - which existed in the first film too - is that the more humorous scenes in the book are not in the movie (i.e, the scenes at the Borrough, and A LOT of Gildaroy Lockhart's scenes - which leaves Kenneth Branaugh with not much to do either).

However, I saw the first film and thought it was a load of rubbish. However, I am not commenting on that here. This film was much better. Not only did I find the story better, but the special effects were very good and they could actually act in this one.

Fist of all, I thought that the characters in Home Alone were in no way apealing, second of all, Kevin is anoying. I was really surprised with this movie because one thing that makes it so wonderful is the characters. When you whatch the movies or read the books, you feel as though you're actually having the adventure with the characters, you feel as though, Harry, Hermoine and Ron are your friends. It's also surpising what a wonderful job Daniel Raddclif, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do acting in this movie.

Daniel's acting were quite so-so, though I still cannot get over his ""kiddy"" voice yet when the third movie was filmed. The first two Harry Potter series were filmed by the director of ""Home Alone 1 and 2"". The direction the film was filmed was really good, and the brightness of certain points of the movie can be seen or the scary parts like when Harry Potter had to fight the snake. The angle shots were also great, the way it was done. Good effects,good setting and good acting.This is another show that I can recommend to anybody.",1

The second film of Harry Potter didn't get more money than the first one, but it still was better than the first one. Usually, the first movie is better, but Harry Potter was the exception. It has more adventure, reveals more secrets of Voldemort, and better effects. A masterpiece -- let's say it like this. However, everything is not that good. Unfurtnanetly, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the movie with more errors in the history of the movies. It counts with more than 250 errors, as seen in the web page, www.moviemistakes.com . But it is still a good movie. The book is also better than the first one, but it's a little bored at the beginning. This movie shows us Harry being warned of great dangers in Hogwarts, however, he still wants to go.

Movie history is littered with incredible movies made from less-than-stellar source material - 'The Godfather', 'Jaws', 'Psycho', 'The Silence of the Lambs' - none would be considered better than low-brow bestsellers, but the movies that were based on them have become unqualified classics. Maybe because a lot of pulp novels were influenced by cinema, and thus, while short on literary quality, serve quite well as screenplays. Or maybe it's because there is no real pressure on the filmmakers to be true to the source material - changing and 'improving' 'The Godfather' would hardly cause the kind of outrage that mangling Salman Rushdie would.",0

Lots of great material from the book is missing, and has in some places been replaced by, in my opinion, pointless action scenes. I particularily missed the deathday party, for instance.

Also, Dobby was one of the most believable CGI characters I've ever seen -- compared to Jar-Jar Binks, Dobby is Olivier. Having said that, HP&COS is a movie for fans of Harry Potter, meaning primarily younger viewers.  My kids argued about the parts that were left out, but my main concern was if I was going to be able to stay awake until the end. SPOILER ALERT: Don't read past this point if you haven't seen the movie. A few things that bothered me:  1) There was no character development. Harry, Ron and Hermione had adventures, but there seemed no movement from the beginning of the story to the end. 2) The villain had no logical reason for the writing on the walls. It seemed to be an excuse for something ominous to happen. 3) It seems to be a common device for there to be a ""mystery"" in which, for misdirection, the wrong person is accused. It's happened in both HP movies. 4) My kids explained that only Harry could understand the ""snake language"" from the walls...but why couldn't anyone else hear it, even as gibberish?  Seems like someone would have called for a plumber because of the noise in the pipes. For parents and those who haven't read the books, it's tempting to start working on a ""to-do"" list about halfway through.  At two hours and forty minutes, the movie is way too long. But for HP purists, it may be just the right length.",0

This movie, like the first, was brilliantly cast, especially with the addition of Kenneth Branaugh as the arrogant Lockhart. But again, I was disappointed with Rickman's 10 minutes of screen time in a 2+ hour movie. Rickman brings a presence to the screen in this role that no other actor could hope to achieve, and is the best cast person in the film.

Well, it doesn't go as far as loving every bad movie if it's only about swords and magic ('Dungeons and Dragons' sucked, for instance), but it's one of my favorite genres. I'm also reading quite some fantasy books, but after having read few sentences of Harry Potter, I decided that it was too much a book for children and thus stopped reading on. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (by the way, the German title would be translated ""..and the Chamber of Scare"") thus is my first deeper insight in Rowlings fantasy world. And the fantasy part of it actually isn't all too convincing. Dumbledore is probably the mightiest magician around, right? So what's he doing instead of saving his school of magical arts? Letting a little boy do the job? Imagine Gandalf not caring all too much about the ring and all that, or imagine Ogion from the (not bad) TV fantasy ""Earthsea"" die from a throwing dagger.. Fantasy movies are all about the magic, and thus the greatest spell-caster should maybe be somehow involved in and capable of saving his world. But then, let me think about it...it's more a movie for kids, right? So the hero must be a kid, even if he seems to be quite uninvolved in the whole plot. And if you try to see it through a kid's eyes, with all those nice effects, everybody flying around, the action scenes and some more or less scary creatures, it's fun to watch.

Also, it was defnitely an adult oriented, whereas I did not even understand a lot of things that happened.

They all sat still and maintained their interest for 2 hours 41 minutes (was it really that long?). Many jumped at the frightening parts and many laughed at the funny parts (me loudest of all). There just wasn't enough of Hagrid and poor old Albus (Richard Harris)was showing that his illness was more serious than the last film - but we all loved the film and were talking about the good bits as we left the theatre. Some achievement! To translate the books and to keep the magic must be difficult but it succeeds. The film was slightly over-long and we were suffering from some discomfort because our seats weren't the best, and the ending was a bit of an anti-climax (should have had more humour, I think) - but - whatever.

The three juvenile leads have really found their roles this time round (Daniel Radcliffe seems to have a particular talent for interacting with CGI) and should be easier for children to identify with while CoS is also a lot funnier than SS, especially the Kenneth Branagh performance as Gilderoy Lockhart. Although in comparison to Lord of the Rings the mysterious, magical world is still a little ""normal"" (and too concerned with presenting sorcerous versions of real world objects and institutions), there's sufficient innovation and genuine darkness to feel you are watching a fantasy film.

But the second movie, the one about the secret chamber, it has a depth that you very seldom come across when it comes 2 ""child-movies"". ",1
865,,"I don't know if this was posted before, but in this movie we learn that Salazar Slytherin was very particular about the students that he wanted ""only pure bloods in Hogwarts"", but when Harry enters the chamber of secrets and finds Tom Riddle and he describes himself as Lord Voldemort he specifically said ""Surely I wasn't going to keep my filthy muggle mother's name"" so that means that Lord Voldemort is not a pure blood, that he is a muggle himself, maybe he really wasn't the true heir of Salazar Slytherin, maybe he performs a spell or a curse on the basilisk so that he can controlled it. So who really was the true heir of Salazar Slytherin I just hope that since harry can speak parcel tong that he isn't the heir of Slytherin and that is what Harry Potter is. Also in the book of JK Rolling they talk about the prophecy of a boy or something like that maybe the prophecy talks about that Harry Potter is the heir of Salazar Slytherin and is related to Lord Voldemort I just hope that is not true. What do you all think?",1

870,10.0,"Now this was an excellent movie.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the first film where I was left thinking, ""is that it""!  The second film however has changed my view completely.  The ending was good but missed the ""extra treat"" that was mentioned in the reviews because I didn't wait until the end credits were over - didn't read the reviews before watching the film!  The film had a lot of hilarious scenes.  I didn't realise it was a three hour film until the film was over and I looked at the watch!  So, don't be put off by the length of the film - you won't feel the time pass by!  If you like this type of films, then this is definitely one to watch!",1

Both movies are faithful to the books, which is very satisfying to all of us who love the HP series, but the movies hold together on their own quite well. Kenneth Branagh is a hoot as the ridiculously pompous teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.  And, if you're a credits fan like I am, stick around until the very end when there's a little extra treat in store.",1
874,10.0,"The film was fantastic!  The kids have really come into their own and are truly actors.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) give us a blockbuster performance.  They are not just good because they are kids, but they give true performances.  This film has much more special effects, done extremely well compared to the first film. This makes the Quidditch match even more entertaining and realistic.  It takes the film to an entirely different level. The film once again is 2:30, however, it felt MUCH MUCH shorter than that.  If you have not read the second book, please be aware that the storyline does become darker, scarier if you wish.  If you have never read or seen the first movie/book, I highly recommend that you do so, as this film jumps right into the action, and you have very little history of the characters.  If you do not know the background, you will easily be confused.",1
875,10.0,"The only reason the first Harry Potter movie may be better is because it was the opener to the series and therefore more magical and new.  This new one offers everything the first did AND more (especially in the climax), but as much new stuff as there is, some of it is still just more of the 1st movie.  It is another episode into the story, so we revisit things from the 1st movie, whether this is good or bad is up to the viewer.  The kids are all great, the teachers are all great, and the action sequences are all great.  10 out of 10",1
876,,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. A Review by Joseph Gibson.,0
877,7.0,"972/5000<br /><br />After the first hour my vote already drops to 5.4<br /><br />Flaws:<br /><br />1) How did Ron know about the bars in Harry's bedroom window? He immediately proceeded to pull out a kind of hook to detach the bars. I know you'll say ""It's magic, what do you expect?"" Yes, but for the sake of the film, he could have said something like ""Hey Harry, we've been watching you without getting caught in these months ...""<br /><br />2) And it was not explained how Harry had the suitcase ready at that exact moment. ""Magic, dude"", all right but Logically, he would have already prepared it because he was trembling at the idea of returning to Hogwarts, but I'm still not sure, he doesn't even mention it ...<br /><br />3) Harry Potter ends up in Diagonally and what do the Weasleys do? they leave him defenseless, without protecting him.<br /><br />But luckily he meets Hagrid, and this saved him from the dangerous people around Diagonally. Very very dangerous.<br /><br />4) Ron and Harry have to take the train, and they are late. Since the wall is impenetrable, they lose the train. The demented Ron is convinced that his parents will never return, so what does he do? The right thing to do is to use the car and fly with Harry to Hogwarts. Are you serious? But also Harry, why does he let Ron do that, when both are only 12 years old? his head doesn't seem to work sometimes. I'd forgive this huge mistake of using the flying car if they were influenced by Dobby, but the elf never mentioned it. Can you ever imagine the reaction of Ron's parents? When they say goodbye to the children and see the train disappear, and go back to the station parking lot and then notice that they are left without a car?<br /><br />5) As soon as they arrive to Hogwarts, the car starts to mumble and ends up on a giant tree, this tree is deadly and furious and would have killed them and destroyed the car in a flash. Ron and Harry survive, the car is in pitiful condition now. The car at a certain point, after the impact, drives off into the forest, without a driver. Wait a second, why couldn't the magic car get away from the tree first and save two children from certain death? Or maybe it was Dobby the driver? I don't know, I'm confused ...<br /><br />6) The Herbology professor who tells the children after Neville Longbottom's fainting something like ""Just leave him there"". Seriously? It's funny though.<br /><br />7) I would have liked to see the sorting of Ginny since she is an important character in the film.<br /><br />8) But what happened to the first lesson of Gilderoy? As a coward, this teacher runs away leaving the children in danger. Not a big deal, in fact Hermione saves everyone with a spell. What a child prodigy, really. But everything that happened in that class is still serious. Neville was hung several meters high. We don't know what happened next, like how the other teachers reacted? Would Lockart hide everything from the other teachers? I have no idea...<br /><br />9) The school is incredibly big. But somehow, the whole school meets the trio right in front of the crime scene ""The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware""I don't really buy that.<br /><br />10) Why didn't the more experienced wizards stop the crazy ball during the Quidditch game? Hermione hinted that it would be dangerous to do so, to stop the ball, for the risk of accidentally hitting Harry. The most powerful sorcerers in the audience would have had no problem stopping a crazy ball. But finally, Hermione destroys the ball. Again, what a child prodigy.",1
878,6.0,"I have read the first two books and seen the movies. The first book was a great story, a non-superhero could handle an end-of-the-world-will-come situation in a kinda non-violent manner.

The Chamber of Secrets makes the audience know how deep the Harry Potter universe is and all the things within. it also had a good flavour to it which will make you watch this movie once you have started watching it and will surely make you a Potterhead if you love the magical world, very less movies are out there which are as perfect and as good as this one.",1

Maybe I am biased because I listend to the audiobook first so the first movie was exciting to watch because it was the first visual expierence I had after knowing the story from the audiobooks. Long story short, the first half of the movie was fun but the second half felt weak and the story was kinda confusing. At some point I wasn't quite sure if Voldemort was acutally Voldemort or not. The finale didn't do justice to the whole build-up.",0
884,,"This had to be the worst film I have ever seen at the cinema. I can't believe how weak this film was. A few friends and I decided to catch the late showing of the film as to avoid the crowds. The show started at 10......we left the cinema at 1am feeling bored, let down and very very tired. The acting was pathetic, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) is obviously getting worse with age. The first film he entertain and was easy to watch. But his performance in the Chamber of Secrets was thin and was barely held up by other cast members. The story is all over the place, going of in different directions and then bouncing back without conclusion to that particular thred. Immensely boring, badly acted and badly directed. I want my £5.20 back please. Lastly, Robbie Coltrane, what has happened to you. You were once a great actor. Go back to being cracker, it's better than being a giant hairy fool who looks up to half a**ed wizard ! James.",0

887,10.0,"This very enjoyable movie is actually even better than the first movie of the series.  All of the actors, especially the three young stars, (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) at the center of the film are obviously more comfortable in their roles as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively.  The story adheres as closely as possible to the wonderfully written book by J.K. Rowling.  While some of the details and events in the book were omitted and several separate scenes in the book were combined into one or two scenes, the true heart and hero of this particular story, Harry Potter, was nicely translated to the screen (and excellently played by Daniel Radcliffe, too.) The sets and special effects were well-done and greatly added to the I-so-wish-this-could-be-a-real-world feel and charm of the movie.   A charming movie that I highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel like a kid again while sitting in the theater!",1
888,10.0,Bruh this movie be making me simp for young voldy.,0
889,6.0,"I didn't much like the second Harry Potter movie. I think the blame lies squarely with Chris Columbus; Alfonso Cuaron should do a much better job with the next movie. Columbus never builds tension into his shots by holding them longer than necessary to communicate a plot point. His camera angles never seem to do more than tell a direct narrative. Unlike plays, movies can force the audience to view the actors according to the very specific intentions of the director, accomplished by the angle, the lens, lighting, etc. Columbus does this somewhat, but not enough.",0
890,10.0,I have read the book as well as seen the movie and i think both are very good in there own right.... The book as more to it and gives you more information...while the film on the other hand gives all the information in a smaller space of time and doesn't explain every detail from the first movie as well as explaining it further if that make sense... Daniel is brilliant as ever playing Harry. and hopefully will carry on to do so in the rest of the films....his chemistry/friendship with Rupert and Emma is shown on screen and off. I cant wait for film 3 and 4 to come out...i have read the books and would like to see the out come of the film...what bits are missing and also if they have added anything which makes the film more funny/different to the books....i have to admit that when harry potter 1st came out in 2001 i wasn't bothered about it..but someone advised me to read the 1st book which i got as a present because they told me that i would enjoy both the book and the film and i haven't looked back since now i just cant wait for the next..... i give the film and the book 10/10,1

892,,"I just watched the movie and I thought it was going well until the showdown. I suppose they just moved too fast.  Everything led up to this moment and it just didn't happen; or didn't happen very well.  But I love the storyline and the fact that they explain why certain events were shown so you don't think there is no reason for it.  Also, I would like to express my admiration for Ms. Rowling; she managed to get an entire generation interested in reading in these times where it is practically a force of nature to plop down in front of the TV or computer.  I wasn't even possitive my own sister could read until she came home one day with HP books in her arms and rambled on and on about them.  I almost cried... I need a moment...;)",1
893,9.0,"After watching `The chamber of secrets' I made a determination to myself: I will definitely go back and watch the next film, not only because this one is a pretty decent sequel to first film, it's because I think that Alfonso Cuaron will make a wonderful work. This film is as fresh and funny as the first one and the visual effects are so much better, the characters and the acting still goes strong and it's funnier than the sorcerer's stone, the only thing that I really hate about this one is the so CORNY last scene, everyone cheering for the Robbie Coltrane's character is just awful, it had nothing to do with anything! Forgetting that scene the film is in some ways better than the 1st one and I really enjoyed it!",1
894,9.0,"The second movie of the Harry Potter series taking you to the fantastic world of Hogwarts, i love it.it Even though many exiting plots were deleted while filming it is still a classical movie which is significant to see. This film is quite scary actually,Potter accidentally got the diary of Tom Riddle by the meantime finding himself as parseltongue which made him doubt himself of choosing to be a Gryffindor last year. This is a gothic film, odd people,a castle full of unknown secrets and secret creatures were all combined in this film. Watching it is a great film for adventurous audiences like me.",1
895,10.0,Go and see it if you haven't already.  This is one of the films that I will be watching many times.  Daniel Radcliffe is excellent!  That goes for Rupert Grint and Emma Watson too.

Chris Columbus has done an amazing work. The movie is very faithful to the book. Of course, some details aren't in the movie BUT the essential is here. All the fans can't complain !! This film couldn't be better. Another thing to notice is the HUGE talent of the entire cast of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe (oh my god this little boy has so much talent !), Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are completely fantastic... They've really grown up ! Tom Felton (Draco), Jason Issacs (Lucius Malfoy), Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart), Alan Rickman (Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Richard Harris (Dumbledore)... had made a great work too. They really know how to play the fabulous characters at Hogwarts. But, the most surprising was -for me- Christian Coulson, who was so amazing as Tom Marvolo Riddle.",1

It still followed the book fairly well and yet threw in little surprises of there own. Thats what makes a book/ movie brilliant. The special effects have upgraded from the lousy Troll in the first one to an absolutely spectacular Basilisk at the end of the movie. The humour was ten times better than the first and the acting was absolutely extrordinary. Chris Columbus did a marvelous job and I for one think he shouldn't resign. However time goes on and we'll just have to wait to see what Alfonso gives us fro The Prisoner of Azkaban.",1

And while I can't also said perfect for HP & The Sorcerer's Stone, it's still way way better than the successor. The adaptation from the novel is awful. I don't know what's wrong with it. It's almost exactly the perfect copy of the novel, everything.      (Could it be this is where the problem is? Movies have their own formula). Almost every scene in the novel are there, but something's missing. I don't know. I just can't feel the passion I used to feel when watching a great movie. Not that it's completely crap. No. It's fine. I think I can still give it 6 out of 10, but surely I will reconsider watching the next sequel while there will be many good movies at this kind of time of the year.",0

Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,Emma Watson gives us the exact characters of Harry, Ron & Hermione respectively. They are marvelous! What i like most in this film are voice of Dumbledore, smile of MacGonagall & Hagrid's Hut!",0
907,8.0,"Direction was better, acting was better, special effects were better than the first.Funny thing about expectations is that they are often wrong. I expected the Sorcerer's Stone to be great because of all the hype. I was bored. It was very disappointing. I go to the Chamber of secrets expecting another lackluster,less than state of the art special effects,run of the mill B movie and again I'm wrong. From beginning to end the movie had my full attention. It's one of those flicks that the smell of fresh popcorn,wafting with the fragrance of melted butter won't get me out of my seat because I didn't want to miss a single scene. That's big in my ratings book. The fist Harry Potter I think I went out to blow my nose. I just didn't care what happened next. Watching Secrets I couldn't wait for the next scene. Big difference in how good a movie is. I must tell you that I have never read any of the Potter books so I don't know how true the movies relate. I felt that I didn't waste $8.75. If you have some time on your hands go see this one. It's worth it.",0
908,,"The excitement dripping from my frosty autumn bum as I rushed in to find a seat at the latest Harry Potter installment, I found myself gleefully following along with the whimsical Williams trademark theme that chimed over the sound system as I sat down. I was excited at the possibilities and potentials this movie could deliver, and thirsty for the magic. The movie starts off promising enough, I was glad to be taken a little deeper into the world of magic that everyday wizards and witches use as we hang out with the Weasley's for a spell. But once at school, there is much the movie tries to accomplish, and it begins to crush under the weight of it's own ambitions (or the ambition of  Warner Bros). Kenneth Branaugh gives a delightful performance, as does the other heavy weights (Harris, Smith, Rickman, and the other elders) as usual. But I felt no connection to Harry. No sense of his struggles or his accomplishments. Rather I felt as if Harry was an empty vessel that was only the carrier of a great magic, not a great magician himself. The protagonists (even young Draco Malfoy) were all much more colorful and interesting characters than the fish eyed little good magicians running around with tears in there eyes and ""we shouldn't be doing this Harry"" look on their faces. I think the studios did a good job of casting and directing the villains, but can't we give some more life to the hero(s)? My next gripe is the music. Was John Williams not interested because the caliber of movie was significantly lower than the first? Was he too busy? Could they not afford him because they spent their budget on effects, yet couldn't even afford all the effects they wanted? (i.e- the phoenix reminded me of a stuffed robotic parrot my grandma keeps in the kitchen that repeats what you say while flapping it's wings and moving it's beak). The music that was ""adapted"" was a bit bludgeoning: all I could think of was the original scenes from the first movie they were taken from. The new cues (synth pads and ""spooky"" atmospherics) were a bit lifeless and repetitive. Could we not get anyone to write new music, people? The last half hour all I could think was ""Scooby Doo...Scooby Doo...Scooby Doo"". Now I have to sit here and watch all the loose ends tie up and come together while the evil plot is explained with painstaking detail by the recently exposed villain mastermind. Then the addendum -glee overload- when all at Hogwart's returned back to normal and cries of joyous triumph filled the air, the theater filled me with the stale stench of a sickeningly tidy little perfect package that didn't leave me with much inspiration or magic at all. I can only hope ""Chamber..."" does poorly enough at the box office that the producers learn to take a little more time and care with the next one. Don't rush it too much fellas...you'll go so fast you miss the magic.",1

It could have been a more exciting and thrilling movie if they followed the storyline better. Some crucial parts are left out. You can't feel how agonising life at 4, Privet Drive is.

We can only hope that when the reins are handed over to another director that the finished product will live up to its predecessors.

It wasn't nearly as bad, I must admit, as I had in preconception. So I was curious to see Chris Columbus pull a ""Home Alone 2"" and ruin the sequel completely... I was dead wrong. This is a very interesting, much more entertaining and much darker film than its predecessor. I would go see it again, as a matter of fact. Now that is terrifying...kids movies are...actually REALLY GOOD movies in their own right? Yikes.",0
918,,"i dont know about anyone else who saw Harry Potter, but i thought it was a lot like the other one, all of the same conflicts occurred, through the quittage, malfoy and even valdamort, basically the same conflicts arose only around a much darker story, which is the only thing i did like.  Harry Potter bored me to death, it would not get to the point, there were at least a dozen scenes that were just pointless and were put in just to please those who are sticklers about book movies. It seems to me, that Mr Potter is not a really great wizard, all of the situations that put him in perilous danger he is helped by others or by some odd coincidence. **SPOILERS** My easiest example about this would obviously be the scene with the spiders about to pounce on Harry and his friend, the car just come out of no where and saves them, even after spitting them out in disgust for whatever reason.  Also when hes fighting the snake the phionex comes out of nowhere and gives him this sword that has no explanation of its signifigance, and when he DOES kill the snake its a total luck shot, all he did was hold it up and the thing did the rest for him. But dont get me wrong i did sort of enjoy this movie, when i wasnt bored, pointing out the ridiculusly predictable plot line, or just flat out screaming for it to end.",0
919,9.0,"Simply put, Sorcerors Stone was a much more moral movie, yes, but the beauty of Chamber of Secrets is that it tackles issues rather than morals.  It does this in a way that you have to be paying attention to realize.  The strain between the Pure Bloods and the Muggle born children, that's as close as you can get to discussing racism without shoving it down a child's throat.  More people should think to utilize a child's perception of good and evil in order to show how the world can (but does not have to be) a bad place. The Chamber of Secrets can be at times, violent, and I certainly would have had nightmares if I was say, five to ten years old, but truthfully, the movies I remember most fondly as a child scared me, such as The Dark Crystal, or The Goonies.",1
920,7.0,"Some will argue that the first film was better. More will argue that this, the second outing of J.K.Rowling's immensely popular novels was better.",1
921,9.0,"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets - the much anticipated sequel to the 2001 blockbuster Harry Potter and the philosophers stone, in my view, is exceptionally better; better in every department, compared to the last one.",0
922,10.0,"I hated Harry Potter, but when I went to see the movie I just fell in love with it. I have read the book five times each, I have seen the movie about eight or nine times, and my room is literally filed with HP merchandise. This movie is such a compelling story full of mystery and excitement. The story starts as always, when Harry is with his aunt and uncle. He feels traped (which he later is by his uncle) because he has not recieved letters from his friends and is still treated badly by his own blood-family he has. When Dobby, a house elf, shows up in his room and warns him not to return to Howgarts, that a terror has been unleashed on mudbloods (muggle born). Harry ignores these warnings and returns to Howgarts, just to discover that a monster has been petrifing mudbloods throughout the year. When all the clues start adding up, it is up to Ron and Harry to capture the monster, bring Hagrid back, and get rid of all the rumors and evil that has been circling around his life. These is a story which all kids around the world will enjoy and cherish for decades to come. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10.",1
923,8.0,"This was better than Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone by far. Gone are the painful introductions of the first film, and now we just have the definately improved acting skills of the kids from one film to the next. Rupert, Daniel, and Emma are all great talents, and the Warners and Columbus are lucky to have them.",0
924,10.0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerts is the best movie in the whole wide world!!! No movie can out do this movie!! Spectacular! Amazing! The BEST! Dazzling!! 10 thumbs up!!! A rating of 10!!! A must see!!!! Awesome!!! Coolest movie!! Best of the Best! Incredible!! Amazing!!! Awesome!! THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD! NO ONE CAN BEAT THIS MOVIE!!!,1
925,10.0,Well i was not disapointed. This was a great movie from begining to finish i love this movie.  I dont know how some people said that this is not as good as the first.  Well they are dead wrong.  I enjoyed this one better than LOTR 2.  This movie never leaves you thinking whens the action.  This is probably one of the years best,1
926,10.0,"This movie ROCKS !!!! i just Loved it !!  i was a non Harry Potter fan, before the first movie, i hadn't even read any of the books and yet i loved it !! lots of action and excitement, and especially in the second one, lots of creepy parts .. it was well acted and i fully intend to buy the video , and i own the first one , and look forward to seeing the next installment , its a definite good time for all the family !! it totally deserves the 10/10 !!!",1
927,,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I found this movie to be quite enjoyable despite the lack of effort from Daniel Radcliffes preformance. I think he preformed terribley as Harry and is the worst actor ever. The film (like the book) was well written and the twist at the end was very cool (I mean TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE being an anigram for I AM LORD VOLDEMORT) nobody saw that coming. I found Jason Issaccs preformance as Dracos father to be superve and very realistic. I'm disapointed that they did not add more of the book into the movie, because if they did it would have made more sense. I am very much looking forward to seeing the next installment of the series I just hope that Daniel Radcliffe does not play Harry in the next one, hes the worst actor ever.",0
928,10.0,"Daniel Radcliffe came back and again made all us kids salivate. Rupert Grint makes us laugh even harder and Emma Watson makes you want to cry. All the actors did an excellent job. 10/10 for acting, 10/10 for words!",1
929,,"Quite honestly, this has been one of the worst book adaptations I have ever seen.  Granted, I haven't seen many, but it's the principle of things. I'm ever so glad that Columbus is not directing the 3rd installment of the HP series.  The imagery is nice and Chris Coulson is hot, so maybe that's the only good thing about this movie, well that and Professor Snape.  If you feel like wasting nearly three hours of your life, I'd recommend reading the book instead of seeing this movie.",0
930,5.0,I had really high hopes for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as well as for the first one.,1
931,,Chamber of Secrets is by far the best movie of the famed Harry Potter series. It depicts Hogwarts in its best form and majesty. PoA is not even half of it.,1
932,10.0,"The first Harry Potter movie broke some big records and started one of the biggest and beloved film franchise of all time. And this movie improved almost on everything the first gave us. In this movie you can clearly see that the main cast is transforming into great actors. Daniel, Emma and Rupert are really good in this movie, and so is the supporting cast too. The great new addition comes in the form of Kenneth Branagh who plays Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. He is one of the highlights in this movie, and is a great comedic element in it. He steals every scene he is in it. He's such a disgusting character but you cannot help yourself, and love that brilliant character. The story is more mature than in the first movie. I would call the movie a horror movie for children. There's a lot of twist and turns that keep you entertaining through this very long movie. And this is the longest of the Harry Potter movies, clocking at 161 minute. But you don't feel it, every minute is entertaining. The story is really well done, wrapped with suspense, adventure and mystery. The negativities I had in the first movie (little bit of 3rd act and CGI) are gone in this one. Every act in this movie is stable. The CGI is incredible improved, and not only that, but after 14 years, this movie looks absolutely incredible. The flying car scene is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. And the House Elf Dobby is incredible to look at, even in 2016. I would even dare to say this version of Dobby looks better than the Deathly Hallows one when it comes to CGI. And the final battle with the basilisk, again, firework for the eyes. This is Chris Columbus second Harry Potter movie, and the direction is, like in the first one, good. He knows what he wants. He's a great visionary director, a talent very important for a series like Harry Potter, full of CGI and action. The cinematography is improved too. This is a very good looking movie. But speaking about the technical stuff of the movie, the real winner is John Williams score. I said that the first Harry Potter movie had one of the best scores of all time, and John didn't disappoint this time either. Such a magnificent and beautiful score this is. And I have to mention this, this movie didn't get any nomination at the Oscars in 2003. This movie, without a doubt, was snubbed for Best Score and Best Visual Effects. This movie is almost without any flaws. The high quality of the movie sticks to the end. I only can recommended this movie to anyone. This is truly one of the best family movies of all time, and maybe the best Harry Potter movie too.",1
933,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is by far my favorite Harry Potter movie. In my opinion, it is the only one that follows the entire plot line except a few minor details. The deleted scenes add even more delicious detailing. If these scenes had been in the theatrical release the movie would have been that much better. Perhaps a reasoning behind cutting these is the movie would have been over 3 hours. Chamber of Secrets is already the longest movie in the series and to have a movie over 3 hours could make audience members' attention drift away (unless of course we're discussing Lord of the Rings or something like that). All in all, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the closest movie to the plot and while many fans don't find this to be their favorite movie I deviate from the majority of the fandom.",0
934,7.0,A very good movie! If you love the first movie than love you this!!!!!! Dobby is come to warn you sire...very good!!!I love this movie!!!!!!!!!

I love this movie!!!!I love this movie!!!You love this movie!!!you love the movies!!!I love the movies!!!!!!!You must see this movie!!!!!!!Harry potter is fantastic!!!!!,1
935,5.0,"I believe that the summery speaks for itself. If there is anything about movies that I simply can't stand, it's a movie that doesn't follow the book it is written about. And on top of that, this movie obviously allows a lot of creative license to the director, because he seems to have changed a lot. That said, it is obvious that he wants to give Harry a lot more credit then is really due him. In the books, we read about a boy trying to make it in a world he doesn't fully understand. In the movies, we see a young superman running around being rather self righteous and suffering from some sort of hero complex. If a movie is going to be the on screen version of a book, then it should remain true to the book. That may just be my opinion I guess...",0
936,6.0,Again this feels more like a kids film than other entries but there are elements working towards the darker tone of the later films. The acting has improved and some good set pieces. The final battle has some tense scenes and would have been out of place in the first.,1
937,,SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING,0
938,7.0,"Watched the movie yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. HP-COS was much better and darker than the previous installment. The graphics and special effects were well done and the CGI character of Dobby was also interesting. I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books yet, so there was no bias or expectations before watching the movie. I can now understand its immense popularity. I find it surprising that even though the world developes technologically, at movies, we still seem to prefer our wizards and elf's and jedi's and the magical alternative universe that they dwell in. Three of last years biggest hits were based on fictional alter universes, and it looks like the same this year. And take note of the increased comic book heroes being presented and succeeding. Real world gritty movies rarely succeed these days and true stories, almost never.",1
939,,"If you love Harry Potter, then you'll love ""Chamber of Secrets"". This has always been my favorite book, and the movie doesn't let down. The story and the pacing are very close to the book. The effects work very well, and seem to be more refined than the effects in the first movie. The basilisk is without a doubt the best effect in the entire movie. I can't believe we're going to have to wait till 2004 to see ""Prizoner of Azkaban"". You'd better believe I'll be there on opening night! Now bring on ""Order of the Phoenix""!",1

942,,"I just got home from the premiere of Chamber of Secrets.  I feel that too much creative lisence was taken with this film.  It was fine if you have never read the books, and were just watching a film, however it left many gaps that I am not sure how they will be recovered in the 3rd movie.",1

946,10.0,"I found that Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was a really amazing film: good actors, excellent visual effects, faith to he book... 5/5 without any hesitation... One only regret anyway: perhaps the script could have mentionned Tom Riddle's past more (the fact he's n orphan, he's been abandoned by his muggle father... His behaviour as Lord Voldemort would become easier to understand).",1
947,10.0,"I must say, in my opinion, the second movie was much better than the first (I did like the first as well however) because the first was an introduction and the second has much more action, and is more exciting.  The characters are also older and that also makes it better.  My favorite characters are now Oliver Wood, Malfoy, and Tom Riddle (I also think Ron does an excellent job in this movie and the other main characters are very good as well!!). I would like replies from other fans, tell me what parts you enjoyed, whether by reply or email, however if by email, specify who you are or I might mistake it for junk mail, I get tons!! AIM- bladerandahalf.",1
948,,"This movie is greater than the previous movie but there are some explanations that are not answered in this film.But the whole movie is really wonderful and its almost  same from  the book.Really great effects and all the cast are wonderful and if you watch it for the first time you feel a little weird to hear all the crack voices by Daniel and Rupert .The ending is really touchy where you can feel the true friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione.It is a well crafted film even though it is not perfect as the book but it's better than the first.",1
949,,"I read all three of the books last summer and working my way through Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. In an age of science and reason, it is still great to curl up with something magical full of mystique, Sorcerer's Apprentice with Mickey Mouse, from Fantasia 2000 is still great. A person is never too old to read great literature, in fact this kind keeps the reader young.",1

955,,"As the movie ended I was filled with a sense of well being, Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets is much better than the first film. Daniel Radcliffe is still finding it difficult to act naturally. Richard Harris however is his wonderful self. I was thinking these thoughts as the credits started to roll..... and then I realised that we will no longer see Richard Harris in any film or on stage again. I stayed until all the credits had gone, but no dedication (the final reel had proberly already been produced, I normally like most people stand up and walk away when the credits start, but this time I sat there till the very end, much to the annoyance of my friends, but I think we owe it to Richard Harris who disliked Harry Potter but did it wondefully none the less. Go see the film it was great (two towers will be the one to wait for however), watch the film, but as a mark of respect wait until the credits finish and remember a great talented actor.",0
956,9.0,"A great film for children of all ages both big and small.The film is over two and half hours long but time seems to fly by. There are plenty of great comic moments and along with lots of exciting action scenes. My 5 year old daughter Sarah, loved the film. She clapped and cheered and was totally engrossed in the film.",1
957,9.0,"The film was really enjoyable, more entertaining than the first and more of a plot line.",1

We enjoyed seeing the development of the friendship & how the characters worked together & helped each other.  The actors are very appealing ( now I can't imagine anyone else in those roles!)  The book is much better, and although they did have to squeeze a lot in , I felt that some issues were too quickly skimmed over.  Still, it's great fun & we're all going to see it again!(this review was a group effort)",1
959,5.0,"3 for the special effects, otherwise totally pointless and boring movie. Holes in the plot are apparent and the movie is full of cliched Hollywood jokes.

961,8.0,"I think Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets was a very entertaining movie, and i would very much like to see it again...I am sure I will buy the movie when it comes to the store....But the grate thing is that it is kind of a warmup for the Lord of the Rings. It is coming to local movies 18 of December this year.... But about Harry Potter, they have made the movie totally like the book, details are even there too.... My comment on Harry Potter is excellent entertaining, a typical evidence at quality movies are firstclass....",1
962,10.0,"Just got done watching the new Harry Potter movie and I thought it was great. Now I haven't read any other books but I kind of want to start into them now. Even though this maybe looked at a childrens series there is lots of stuff in it that I can love too. Now I'm not that old, only 22 but I love fantasy stuff like this. My mind starts to wander, actually my imagination starts taking over instead of reality. For those of you that liked the first movie I will believe you will enjoy this one too. Unlike most sequals I guess you could say aren't that great this one does continue the story line well but doesn't get boring or anything like that. But for those of you that have young children and are planning on taking them to this movie be warned that there are some parts that are pretty scary for a youngster. Although I don't have children I heard a lot of parents saying they're not so sure if they will let their young ones watch it. Hope this helps some of you on your decision if you will see it or not, I feel like it was worth it.",1
963,,"The movie was great...Not as good as the first one but it was still good. This one was longer, but it didn't feel like that. I loved all of the cool special effects and the scenery. Especially seeing more of Hogwarts. Now I know what the school looks like a little bit more. Was it just me or did any of you other people notice how the actors kept changing the way that Ginny Weasley's name was pronounced. It went from (phonetically) Guinea to Gin-knee depending on which actor said it and when they said it. I thought that was hilarious. Overall I give the movie 3.4 stars and I can't wait to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.",1
964,10.0,this movie is THE BOMB. despite hearing some things about this movie being bad I enjoyed it very much. it stuck to the book like glue. I have yet to see a person who did not like this movie as much as I did.I hope you people agree.,0
965,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provided a very enjoyable movie-going experience.  It moved at a quicker pace than the last Harry Potter film, and kept its audience on their toes throughout the film. However, as I looked around the packed theatre and noticed several little kids, I began to wonder how this movie could be aimed at such young children.  Scenes with giant snakes and spiders, messages written with blood, and ghosts will certainly be the cause of countless nightmares. What good can come of showing little children a graphic portrayal of someone slaying a giant serpent?  Or of a floor littered with bones?  Harry Potter kept the audience entertained, but at the expense of the kids that it was supposed to be for.  Hopefully, in the next installment of this series, the producers will be reminded who their audience is - the kids - and aim the movie more towards them.",0

967,7.0,"Arg. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie - hoping that the ineptitude displayed by Chris Columbus in the philosopher's stone would have been rectified, but I was horribly disappointed. Flashes of brilliance in cameos or effects and background details are overshadowed by poor handling of the young cast and jumpy leaps in plot. Kenneth Branagh, Mark Williams and Alan Rickman among others threaten to steal the show from the younger cast members amidst much improved special effects and scenery.",0

973,10.0,"This was one of the best movies ever made. I loved the spiders, Moaning Myrtle, and the special effects. I also loved how most of the actors seemed to slip right into their roles. The only complaint I have is that Daniel Radcliffe had slow reaction time with some of the special effects, but that just seemed to add humor to the movie.",1
974,10.0,"It was great to see a film where the actors mature with the characters. There has been alot of talk about the actors not continuing with the 4th film but why shouldn't they? As every year they film the movie they are one year older like, just like the students at hogwarts. In America teens are played by actors up to the age of 30. It added to the character of film for talented actors to take great roles, there was a great performance by kenneth Branagh which didn't upstage the young actors all this combined to give a more mature and funnier film than the first one. Bring on the 3rd...............",1

I was really glad they stayed true to the book and I was really happy with how the movie turned out. I think it lived up to everything it was said to be. IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME and I would recommend it to anyone...Harry Potter fan or not. <8-)",1
977,9.0,I love it I think it's even better than the first! The acting is great and the action everything seems so real. So if you're considering whether to see it or not I think you should see it!!! :)My fav character has to be Ron he's the funniest!!!,1

979,10.0,"I loved Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone. I read the book first of course and when I went to see the movie, I did not expect to see so much of the magical things from the book. I was surprised and pleasantly gratified. Well, moving on, I recently went to observe the new Harry Potter movie The Chamber of Secrets. The movie was wonderful! The loyalty Harry Potter had for Professor Dumbledore, it was heart warming. The Spiders seemed very real and the flying car was something I did not expect would be in the movie. Harry was very brave in the battle between him and ""Tom Riddle'.  I cannot wait until the next movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban.",1
980,10.0,"the film was amazing. infact it was even better then the last. I did not like the spiders, but that has alot to do with the fact that the graphics were so good they looked so real.(i dont like spiders) i dont know what else to say except if you have not seen it do it do it NOW.enjoy. :o)",1
981,,"Wow what a relief. As an avid reader of the books I was disappointed in the first film. However, Chamber of Secrets surpasses Philosophers Stone by miles, largely due to huge increase in acting ability and confidence shown by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and co. The screenplay is also more accomplished and funnier with less cliqued lines (although some still remain!). Kenneth Branagh is a superb Gilderoy Lockhart, oozing smarminess and vanity. Chris Columbus engineers some amazing shots in this film. The very first and the last especially stand out. Critics of the last movie said the film wasn't magical to watch, but Columbus has restored the magic in this movie. The special effects are slicker and more believable while Dobby, although not quite how I imagined him, grew on me. All in all a great cinematic experience.",1
982,,"I was persuaded to go to see this movie last night. Have you ever thought ""Life is too short""? If so go to this movie as it will make the 2 hours 40 minutes of it's runtime seem like ten hours therefore extending the apparent span of your life. Of course another way to look at it would be that it's a waste of 160 already scarce minutes. And it's just eaten another 10 of my valuable minutes writing this!! In summary, go to see it under one of two conditions. A) you are 10 years old B) you have extreme insomnia.",0
983,10.0,"A great film that exceeds the first as it is more of a movie than a straight copy of the book. The younger members of the cast have grown into their rolls and are all more convincing second time around. The special effects are good but the people are still the stars. Quite how they will replace dear departed Richard Harris I don't know as he excels again, but in every other way this augers well for the future films.",1
984,8.0,OK... this film is definitely worth seeing.  I don't need to say much about that.  Darker and better than the first.,1
985,10.0,"I wasn't a fan of the first movie and actually shuddered at the fact that I had to see ""Chamber of Secrets"", but I was so pleasantly surprised.  So much better than the first in my opinion. Also, seeing Richard Harris, the one and only, in his final role, obviously laboring through, still performing as only he could.  Well worth it just for that.",1

987,10.0,"this movie was definatly 100 times better than the first, but the 2nd book is also twice as good as the first book, so what do you expect!  but aside from storyline, the actors have matured SO much, it's nuts, the first movie they look so young, you can tell they've aged very much since the beginning of filming of the sorcerers stone.  they also have gotten much better at acting, and playing their respective roles, especially daniel radcliffe and tom felton.  daniel(harry) fulfills his role of victor/defender/hero MUCH better in the 2nd film, he is truly a hero, and did an awesome job. and i just love tom felton, he has truly made draco the little devil he is, but i luv him neway! fans of all ages will surely enjoy this film, it is hilarious, GREAT comic relief, but also SCARY, i jumped a few times, and i'm 19 and i don't get scared easily( not saying this film scared me, but i was started and some things in it are just creepy! ) it's great, i say the target audience, which would enjoy and get the most out of this film is definatly those ages 13-25 who've read the books, and in addition adults of course!  but as for the younger crowd, well i don't think they can appreciate the books, and the myths/legends/facts jk rowling draws everything from, or the symbolism/foreshadowing etc. not to mention this movie is definatly scarier than potter #1   THIS GETS A BIG 10 FROM ME. GO READ THE BOOKS THO!!!!!!",1
988,9.0,"Much better than the first movie, this 2:40 tome passes without much squirming on the part of the young ones. There are a few scary sequences during which your under-9 children might want to hold onto your arm but overall this movie moves right along with excellent visuals and tight acting. While the movie adheres rather strictly to Rowling, there is enough imaginative license to keep the adults amused while the kids enjoy it as well. Overall, this movie is the equivalent of tiramisu on the second day--much better mixing of ingredients and more subtle flavors. Enjoy.",1
989,10.0,"I went and saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets today.  I was expecting a great movie and my expectations were fulfilled!  This movie is great!  After reading the book, the movie kept to the book and matched what I had imagined! It was very exciting and there was never a dull moment. The effects were better, too!  I noticed a huge improvement  This movie, unlike most sequels, was better than the first!",1
990,,"As a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books I do not feel that this movie did the book justice.  I took my husband to see it, and spent the entire car ride home filling in all of the blanks for him. Once again, Hollywood has taken over and left the story by the wayside.  The exclusion of many characters left the story empty and undeveloped.  Taking away the History of Magic professor, who unwillingly told the story of the Chamber to the students in the book, left that task to Professor McGonagall.  This was totally out of character for her, as she would not want to frighten the students.  By lessening the part of Colin Creevy, and removing the girl who is later found to be Percey's girlfriend in the book, the film leaves out the feeling of the panic felt by the students in the book.  You don't feel their fear and uncertainty.  The film also leaves out Harry's isolation. The majority of the book is Harry's struggle with the whole school that had turned on him, which drives his desperation to find the real heir of Slytherin.  It also shrinks Ginny's part, as well as her crush on Harry. Without including how she was gushing about how wonderful Harry was in the journal, the film offers no explanation of how Tom Riddle grew to hate Harry and want him dead.  In the movie, Tom Riddle says that he took the name Voldermort because he would not keep his Muggle father's name.  That leaves the audience wondering how he could then be the heir of Slytherin.  It leaves out that Slytherin was from his mother's side and that his father left her when he found out that she was a witch.  But I must say the absolute most annoying part of the movie was the final scene, which had no part in the book where Hagrid returned and the entire room applauded.  It might have had more meaning had they bothered to include how half the school thought he was guilty, but either was it was pure Hollywood.  I do realize that in any film adaptation of a book things need to be left out, and I was even glad that many of the Lockhart scenes were excluded.  I just think that the overall story needs to be upheld so that the film can at least be understood for those who haven't read the book. All that aside, I still enjoyed watching the movie simply because I enjoy the characters so much.  For those of you who have not read the books, please to not judge them based on these movies.  Justice was not served.",0
991,,"This movie was amazing! Once again Rupert, Dan, and Emma did amazing jobs as the main characters. Gilderoy Lockhart made you laugh by just looking at him and moaning Myrtle was annoying and spooky just like she was supposed to be! The only thing we had negative to say about it was that they left out a few parts we felt were important and some parts of it were different than the book but didn't have to be. But ya know, it's HARRY POTTER!!!!! so it was amazing anyway! Go see it.",1

To my surprise it wasn't long at all because the movie kept me interested at every single second... it's really sad that the person who played Albus Dumbledore died two weeks ago.... otherwise the movie was the best that it could be!  Everything looked so real I'd advise everyone to go see it!,1

996,,"""Dobby has come to warn you sir.""-A quote from this story which I found very suitable for this movie and something I say to you now as a fellow moviegoer. I found this movie to be utterly boring myself. I found too many transactions that could have had different connotations, most of which only adults would understand. This in itself was the only entertainment i got from this picture. Maybe i was looking for something other than a reproduction of a childrens story. Not having read any of the books in this series, I can only imagine that the people who have critiqued this film found excitement from finding if the director had different interpretations than themselves. One thing I did not like was the fact that the only bloodshed occured during the conclusion of this movie. I found it to be a rude awakening from the childish jokes. I thought it was humorous how all of the children thought it funny when Dobby started inflicting pain upon himself and I wondered what this was teaching them. I don't want to spend all night talking about this movie and I know one critical review wont stop you from seeing the movie, but if you decide to see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I recommend you pay the matinee price.",0

1000,,"I had been ignoring the Harry Potter phenomenon that seems to be sweeping the country - both in the child and adult world.  Previous to seeing this second installment I had not seen the first film, nor had I read any of the books.  I must say that after seeing Lord of the Rings on the Big Screen, I go to the cinema not expecting to even come close to having the same cinema experience.  But I have to say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the closest film to it so far.",1
1001,9.0,"Chamber of Secrets is an excellent movie. However, like the Sorcerer's Stone, it falls into the same assumption that you've read the book. However, this movie will not disappoint fans and Kenneth Branaugh as Gilderoy Lockeheart is hilarious!",1

1003,,"As someone who knows the books cover to cover, this movie wasn't as good as it could be, but it's certainly not bad either. It's quite entertaining, the acting is much better, and the fluidity of the books finally seems to be coming out. Although Professor McGonagall is too old, Flitwick doesn't have the same energy as he did in the book, Ron (Rupert Grint) seems somewhat unlike himself and the moving staircases were a kinky touch, Potter fans will appreciate it nonetheless. I look forward to the movie version of Prisoner of Azkaban (mostly because of Sirius and Lupin) as much as I do the fifth book (the Order of the Phoenix).",0
1004,9.0,"Many have said that sequels hardly ever surpass their originals. Though this is true, it is not the case with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  In my opinion, this one was far better than the first. Don't get me wrong, i loved the first, but this one really was a lot better. What made this one better, i thought, were the special effects. In the first, they were good, but now they're amazing. In other movies where computer animation was used, you can tell that it isn't real.  However, in this movie, everything looks realistic. Anyway I truly recommend this movie to everyone. It really doesn't matter what age you are or if you are a Harry Potter fan. Trust me, it's worth the money!!",1
1005,10.0,"I watched this movie with my family and we loved it. It's great fun for all ages. It's scarier and funnier than the first.

I'd say its the ""Best movie Ever!"" 10/10",1
1006,9.0,"This Harry Potter (I won't bother to explain the plot - you all know it) is simply amazing. It surpasses the first one by several wand-lengths. Daniel 'Harry' Radcliffe is his usual brilliant self, but it's obvious that Emma 'Hermione' Watson and Rupert 'Ron' Grint are more used to being on a filmset now. They are both great, but I'll have to admit that I like Rupert the most. The expression on his face when he meets the spiders! Tom 'Draco' Felton is also great, and so are, of course, all the adult actors in CoS too. This time it's scarier (I was dangerously close to wetting my pants a couple of times), darker and SO much better! The difference between the two books aren't nearly as huge as the difference between the two movies. It totally deserves to be the box office block buster it may (and WILL) become!",1
1007,,"Of which the first one had. The first had been about discovery of this boy's true being and the way he handled it. This one, however, is a mystery movie, much more than SS was. The characters are older, taller, and slightly better actors from before, but that doesn't make up for how this film begins to draggggggg along middle-end of the movie.True to the book, but little things the peeved me off, like how arogog had tried to eat Harry, unlike the book where he had tried to attack harry until how he found out it was a friends of his masters. But I guess they needed a ""Run like hell"" sequence, so, whatever. I liked the ending where he had fought the Basilisk, but i never would've picture the snake to look more like a dragon. I give it 3 1/2 outta 5. That's good, right?",0
1008,10.0,"This film was a wonderful followup to the first year.  The characters stayed true to the book.  The effects were well integrated.  Most of the characters were well cast.  The only exception would be the choice for Gilderoy Lockhart.  Not that the Kenneth Branagh wasn't great, he just didn't fit the image I had in my head.  The other fans of the books and the movies made similar comments.",1

Now, when i went to go see the 2nd HP movie, you all can imagine that i thought it was going to be the same as the first. Choppy, mixed up and not that great. I prolly wouldnt have gone to see it, but my sister wanted to see it (shes 11) so i HAD to go take her to see it. I was so surprised to see that i liked this one! It had flow, more action, and it was just all around MUCH better than the first one! I even screamed at one point..i forget where...but i just got into this one. Well, that is my opinion.",1
1010,10.0,"As a huge fan of the books, it's a delight to see how closely both of the movies have followed them. ""Chamber of Secrets"" was exhilarating and enthralling from beginning to end.

I thought the acting was brilliant, and I don't agree that the leading child actors are getting too old for the parts. Surely they should age with the characters portrayed? Overall, a superb film!",1
1013,10.0,"Having read all four of the Harry Potter Books I looked at this upcoming movie a little more critically. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets did a fantastic job in bring the second year to life.  Chris Columbus the directed has been criticized for his focus on the special effects of the movie rather than the text of the movie overall.  I beg to differ.  Columbus's focus on special effects is one of the important things that brought this movie to life.  Bringing this book to life is no easy task and Chris Columbus has done an excellent job with his intense special effects. Daniel Radcliffe returns to play his famous role yet-Harry Potter. His two sidekicks Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) embark on another adventure where they investigate the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.  Let's face it, these kids are Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  They prove time and again how magical these books and movies are.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Potter's enemy does an excellent job making the viewer hate him and his family.  A final bravo goes to the rest of the cast: Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape), Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockheart).  The faculty and staff of Hogwarts that keep the students in line and on their toes at all times.  Richard Harris who played Albus Dumbledore.  He did an excellent job portraying the lighthearted but strong Dumbledore.  Harris will forever live on in our hearts as the one and only Dumbledore.  Anyone who takes on this role will have their hands full.  He will forever be remembered and missed.",1
1014,,"I notice that Harry Potter movies are getting ""markdowns"" because they dont totally fufill the book as everyone would like. I am one who agrees but think about it. You have 3 hours to make a movie that takes 2-5 days to read. You have to cut down a few scenes that arnt on plot. Most of the written words are how the characters look. So were getting it without realising it. This movie was funny, dramatic, heartwarming..Everything. It was a great movie. Movies arent ment to be word for word with a book..reading a book is fun..Watching it line for line isnt! Its fun to have changes, it makes the book more surprising to the readers of Harry Potter. Others say that it was ""plotless"". Book 2 is out of the Harry Potter book flow. We all know that. Book 5 is said to be the one that puts book 2 in the circle of books. It was more fast pace cause we know whos who and whats what. Get in the story and foucus most of the time on the big scenes. A childrens movie? Yes. A childrens book..NO! Im 16 and i have read the 4 books numerous times. I know older people who have to. Its more like a adults book that remind us about our childhood. Its on a childs level for them but its also on a higher lever for older people. Everyone of the actors did so well. Harry/Dan was so much more coragous. Hermione/Emma was a lot more forward and emotional. Ron/Rupert was just pure funny! Tom/Draco was much more malevolent and evil. Also with the other children/teen actors they did well. Every single one of them. The adult actors brought the tone and so wonderfully! Alan Rickman, Jason Isaccs, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Kenneth Branagh, Robbie Coltrain, and Shirley Henderson all did outstanding. All of the cast, crew and members of this did so well. I enjoyed the effects. Next time hopfully Quittich will be longer. Sad to see Chris Columbus step down but Im trilled for ""new blood"" to direct and see what will happen. Prisoner of Azkaban is most likely gonna top the first two. I hope so atleast.This is more focused around Hogwarts so thats a good thing. We get more in class and Quittich. Also Alan Rickman..who everyone wants to see more of.",1
1015,,"Saw the first twice. Liked it okay, but too mechanical. This has a much greater freedom and sense of fun to it. The young cast seems much more comfortable in their roles, especially Hermione Granger. The effects a great and the story moves along very well! I definitely recommend!!!",1
1016,,I thought Harry Potter was outstanding.I thought the first one was good but this was way better.I loved the spell fight.And anyone who dis liked it must have brain damage.Quidige was awesome.I am happy that Harry caught the snitch.But I think it should have been more like the book.And I think the snake was nasty.And the tree part couldn't have been cooler.You must go see it and lets pray that the new Dumbledoor is good because the last one kicked the bucket.We will send an owl to your house telling you to go see it.,1
1017,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the fast paced sequel in the Harry Potter series.  The young actors have matured in more ways than one, the older actors are still amazing, but what else is to be expected when teaming together Richard Harris (Prof. Dumbledore), Dame Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid). This movie is slightly darker than the first, but that's to be expected when there are disembodied voices and one gigantic snake.  The film introduced aspects such as new characters with a fluidity that if made like the first movie would have looked choppy and second rate.  This movie is absolutely fantastic and has me counting the days until the release of the third movie which will be the introduction of a new director and many new characters to the world of Harry Potter.",1
1018,,"I have to say that I am bit picky when it comes to movies, but the latest in the ""Harry Potter"" series has REALLY done something. Yes, the first one was fabulous, and it served a specific purpose (as did the first book) in totally immersing the audience in the majesty and mystical qualities of Harry's world. However, the ""Chamber of Secrets"" is every bit as dark and intense as the book. I have read all 4 books, and I think that the attention to keeping the important aspects of the book in the movie are CLEARLY evident. The actors do a great job in being what they are....kids. They are just as I imagined when reading the books, and the lighting cues that were put into play this time around really showed the ""dark"" side of Harry's ""gifts.""",1

1021,6.0,"Yes, it is indeed a very good movie. Both for movies in general and as a Fantazy Saga. But it has something that is missing or feels incomplete. Why didn't I feel as thrilled as when I watched the first movie? I actually felt a little bit disappointed. I think it has some problems. And the most of it has to do with the rythm of the movie. What I really liked with the first movie was rythm in it. The way it was cut and told was in fact - excellent! The way the characters were introduced, the way of telling the story with the camera which sometime really rested on the pictures. If it was a children's movie or not has nothing to do with if it was good or bad. It was indeed a really excellent handicraft. But this movie lacks the balance of the first one. Even if it is long, I actually think the movie would have been better if they made it even longer! Why? - The story and the characters are not introduced properly. The editing is faster then that in the first one and details which could have been exciting or funny gets lost or actually even destroyed because of this. It feels like that they could have done so much more with everything. In this movie I have no feeling for the characters. Not for the new ones nor even the old ones. Only a stupid owl and a Phoenix gets my sympathy. they were indeed the best with this movie!",0

Even though I would've liked it better if they hadn't cut out death day and Valentines day, it wasn't disappointing! It's sad that this is the last one Chris Columbus will be directing, because he did an absolutely  great job. Richard Harris should be proud this was his last movie. It was extremely funny how Ron (for some reason I can't put the actors name o_0) kept throwing up slugs. The only thing that annoyed me in the movie was how Tom Fulton kept saying Potter, it sounded as if he was trying to get rid of half his spit at the same time.  What also bothered me was Draco called Harry a ballerina (or something like that) yet during he duel he is more graceful then Harry. The amount of splits Fulton did, you wonder does he want kids.

Oh sure, there are parts that need to be cut or shortened up, but as the overall story goes, it was great fun.

Weak points: too long and sometimes slow-moving; poor direction of Rupert Grint, who spends too much time squeaking and looking terrified; hopelessly wooden acting of Christian Coulson as Tom Marvolo Riddle; disappointing and unconvincing climax. The noise level is generally high (sometimes excruciatingly so), yet some of the diction of the actors is not altogether clear. Not as good as the first Harry Potter film in my view, but worth seeing nevertheless. Marks: five out of ten.",0

1037,,"This book pulled more interest to me then others did. This is the only Harry Potter book i have fully read before watching the move. The fact that Harry is still younger and he is still figuring this whole wizard thing out is absolutely amazing. Harry is very gifted, Rowling's does very well with his character harry by making him still seem so definitely out of control, but somehow harry always finds a way to make the right things happen. As one of the most famous Authors out now because of these books Rowling's is still making books about this, he has built an imaginary world that kids will be reading about for years and years to come. Harry, Ron, and Heromine all figure out that the chamber of secrets has been opened and Harry must figure out all the clues to save his friends. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of 8, for it's full of exciting adventure and scary situations that only one wizard could over come. I have learned something from this book also its that no matter how hard something is as long as you stay brave and trust yourself to do the right thing",1

In this installment Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (played by Rupert Grint), and Hermione (played by Emma Watson) must fight to stop the genocide of the mudbloods. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ron, accompanied by two of his brothers, free Harry from his aunt and uncle's home where he is being held. Soon after the students return to Hogwarts something begins attacking mudbloods and Harry begins hearing voices.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione then set into motion a plan to find the Chamber of Secrets and try to destroy the monster before any mudbloods are injured. There are a number of similarities between the Chamber of Secrets and Lord of the Rings the Two Towers.  The most notable similarity is the underlying theme of racism.  Other similarities include the fight between good and evil and the use of magic.  In the Lord of the Rings each of the races believes its race to be superior and orc race trying to eradicate all of the other races. Chris Columbus directed both Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the first installment Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.  Columbus really sets the stage with the appropriate use of high contrast, low key, and three-point lighting.  Light and dark have very symbolic meaning and without correct use the movie would have lost much of its ambiance. It is very important in today's society that children learn about racism and the effects it has on others.  While education at home and at school are extremely effective tools in eradicating racism we should grasp all opportunities to teach this lesson.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is able to connect with children and addresses this issue without pressure.",1
1042,10.0,"computer animation lovers will definitely fall in love with this movie as the animation is some of the best ever (minus Lord of the Rings movies). HP lovers are in for a treat as this movie brings to life the characters in the best way (perfect guy for Lockhart, he really seemed conceited). better than the first film and and a much better understanding of wizards and the life at Hogwarts. like i said, a MUST SEE MOVIE for everyone.",1
1043,6.0,"The SFX were impressive, especially the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldn't tell he was CG by his bad creation, but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.",1
1044,,"i agree and really i think we see the movie that way is because we've already read the books and after that are expecting something like it when you see the movie. when u see the first movie its good then u read the book and its better than the book but if u read the book first u expect a lot of things out of the movie that wont deliver... and w/ the bad acting...not trying to stick up for them ne thing (but i do love the characters) but remember the people who casted them got the people best picked for the parts so...it could have always been worst. i also believe that as these kids do more or the movies their acting skills will get better, this is some of the kids first movies so it would be unfair of us to expect Oscar award winning acting u kno? i already think the actings gotten better since movie #1.",1
1045,8.0,There is a rule which say that a sequel is always going to be worse than the first film. But with Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets and Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers it is shown that a sequel can be equally good or even better than the first film.,0
1046,10.0,"A typical Harry Potter film, with stunning performances from: Danial Radclif as Harry Potter, Rupert Gritt as Ron Weasely, and the perfectly G-O-R-G-E-O-U-0-S-E , Emma Watson as Hermione Granger(her parents are the G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T artists E-V-E-R!!!!!!!!). And of course I cant forget to mention the marvelouse Richard Harris as Hogwarts Head Marster, Albus Dumbledor, and it was an extreme tragedy when Richard Harris died a little while after the release of 'Chamber of Seacrets' on to DVD and VHS. i think it is safe to say that Richard Harris made the character Albus Dumbledor what he is today. As a fan i can say honestly that, like other fans i await the release of the rest of the Harry Potter books on to the big screen, however I don't know how thay will replace the awesome talent of Richard Harris, but they will shurly be great films none the less. Thank you for reading my review on the movie 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Seacrets'",1
1047,8.0,"Chamber of Secrets is a bit darker than Philosopher's Stone (UK)/Sorcerer's Stone (US), and Daniel Radcliffe's acting had improved this time round (he was a little wooden in the first film).",1
1048,9.0,"The one main reason why I like this movie is : It is exciting, and keeps me nervous all the time. During the part in which Harry fights with Riddle, at first Harry is beaten by the curse & I really think that Harry would die. However, with the help of the Phoneix which is sent by Dumbledore, Harry finally can escape from the attack and be safe. In addition, the music, the vivid acting of characters, it all makes me thrill and as if I were in the scene, witnessing the whole incident. I think the music is well written and digital sound effect in the theatre is astonishing. I can still hear all the sound effects even when I am sleeping. Besides, the story fulfills the spirit and the ideal of youngsters: fight against the enemy and having mysterious adventure. I learnt that we have to be brave when we are in tough situation. Furthermore, we need to have confidence for ourselves and at last the good guy can beat the evil. Though we can see such plot and philosophy in other movies, but I am truly touched in this particular one. The story seems to be a mystery when people become petrified one by one. However, with Harry at the most important role, he solves the mystery by himself and fights against Lord Voldemort. Finally he wins and there comes a happy ending. I think throughout the whole movie, the acting of characters, the music, the set-up and the storyline all reach a satisfactory standard for audience.",1

1050,8.0,"If you thought the first movie was good than you will think this one is great. This is a great family movie. Both adults and children can follow this move with ease. This movie is not just another child's cartoon with unbelievable monsters like ""Monsters Inc.""; it is well-developed movie with great special effects. I personal have not read the book, but now after seeing this movie, it makes me want to read the whole series starting with the first one. My favorite character in this film was Dobby the mischief elf; he is mysteriously great in this film. It was apparent to me that Harry Potters (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson) has settled comfortably into their roles.",1
