0,9.0,"If you've read all the Harry Potter books, then you should know that, as the series went on, they essentially became an allegory for totalitarianism. Certainly one can see that in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. The three are now having to live almost in secret due to the almost fascistic takeover of the wizarding world by Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) minions. In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin's USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the ""other"" (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.",1
1,9.0,"A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate instalment of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. ",1
2,8.0,"As Harry and Ron and Hermoine and everyone else has grown up, so have the audiences with the Potter franchise. So it should make some sense that by the time the seventh book has come around that it's coming down to the wire: the big showdown between Harry and the Man-We-Don't-Speak- His-Name, oh, whatever, Voldemort. It's usually that the mid-point movie (i.e. Empire Strikes Back) is the darkest one, but there was a quasi-dark ending to Half-Blood Prince, so it makes more sense that the filmmakers take Rowling's Deathly Hallows and turn it into what it should be: a ripping good apocalypse yarn.",0
3,9.0,"Just for the record, I love the books(for a while Philosopher's Stone was a huge favourite of mine) and I personally like the films. None of them are masterpieces, but they are likable, entertaining and I think well made too. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with high expectations, there were many friends of mine who said it was brilliant and the best yet. After seeing it with my family last night I have to say Amen! This was a wonderful film in my opinion, and it does a very good job sticking to a mammoth story. I also think they made the right decision splitting it into two parts, if they hadn't the result I think would have been too rushed.",1
4,7.0,"It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.",0
5,10.0,"This is not a run of the mill series, but something which has been intricately planned for from almost the very beginning. With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo, where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince, things get a lot worst here from the start, where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic, before we see Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.",1
6,4.0,"Since we first heard of WBs decision to break the last book of the HP series into two books, we've all been asking ""is this required to give full treatment to the Harry Potter universe wrap-up, or is it just a ploy to make the studios more money?"" After seeing HP/DH Pt I, I have to say ""it's the latter"".",1
7,7.0,"I confess. I read the book about a dozen times in the past few years. It's not like I don't do anything else, but I do. In a year, I probably get through about 25-30 books. So reading HP and the DH was just something I was enjoying. There are clues in various places in the books, and you just have to marvel at how Jo Rowling tied up all the ends so nicely in the last one.",0
8,8.0,"Right from the very start, when the Warner Bros logo appears, this film feels different. The colours are gray and muted, the sound is a low rumble and even the famous theme from John Williams seems to have given way to a much darker drone. It doesn't even feel like a Harry Potter movie anymore. It makes the first Chris Columbus movies feel like they are from a whole different universe. And this feeling stayed with me right until the endÂ… For the last few instalments of the series (possibly from number 3 onwards) we've been hearing a lot of ""this one is darker"" type of lines being bantered about, whether from the critics, the fans or even the film-makers themselves. But it's never been more true than in this final chapter.",0
9,9.0,"The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.",0
10,5.0,"Even having read every ""Harry Potter"" book and seen every ""Harry Potter"" film, I still hesitate to call myself a fan. It isn't that I don't enjoy the world J.K. Rowling invented or the characters she created, but rather that my enjoyment of the series has always been transient. With sometimes years between each subsequent release, my memory of the litany of events preceding them is often shaky at best, and I've never felt particularly inclined to re-visit.",1
11,9.0,"After having seen HP6, I honestly didn't have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier, as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn't give you the feeling of a coherent work - I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However, I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.",0
12,8.0,"Ever since the release of the first Harry Potter movie in 2001, I've wondered how a TV miniseries of the books would have fared. The movies so far have had difficulties showing enough of the books' events within a reasonable time slot to keep the story flowing. They've all had to omit significant plot points, which has not only disappointed the more literal-minded fans but risked the integrity of the story. This was most painfully evident in the fifth movie, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" which awkwardly attempted to fit the longest Potter book into just 2 hours and 15 minutes of film. The result was a movie that felt choppy and barely coherent, almost dreamlike. The two best films up to now--the third and the sixth--worked in part because they took the most risks, often departing substantially from the narrative of the books, to the consternation of many fans. I was not one of the fans complaining, because I figured that as long as it wasn't a miniseries, the best approach was to interpret the story rather than present the events exactly as they appeared in the books.",0
13,9.0,"Up until now, I was convinced that from the 4th book onwards, Harry Potter-books had become too complex to make into film: Goblet of Fire was a sore disappointment. Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more, even if it wasn't a bad film per se (personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt they left out too much). Half-blood Prince -while visually stunning- did not capture the brilliance of the book. With ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", I think the makers have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that was both fun to watch for casual viewers while also catering to the needs of the hard-core fans who know the books by heart. The decision to split the movie into two parts may be judged as a financial one by some, but I'm convinced it was the only possible way to make this work. The movie was cut off at the perfect time as well, having the viewers yearn for more without being too abrupt.",0
14,6.0,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 1"" is the seventh out of eight Harry Potter films. It is the year 2009 already and the kids have considerably grown up, a lot has happened already and Potter and the gang get ready for their final battle with Voldemort. We have more evil characters than ever. Lestrange, Umbridge, Snape, Draco, Wormtail etc. (seem to) have joined the Dark Lord. The film is directed once again by David Yates, just like films 5, 6 and 8. It is written again by Steve Kloves who wrote all the Potter films based on Rowling's books except one. The film scored Academy Award nominations for its visual effects and art direction, but came short as always. Just no luck with the Academy for Potter.",0
15,5.0,I won't go into the story as there is too damn much to go through and anyone watching this film that has not watched the first 6 is wasting their time anyway. ,1
16,1.0,"My first attempt in watching this movie I fell asleep. The second attempt was more successful as I managed to stay awake. But what on earth did I just see. The first three HP movies were mysterious and magical. And as Harry matured he became stronger and skilled. After the third movie the Harry we see on the screen is nothing but a plot device. He is nowhere near as impressive and no match at all for any bad guy,in a believable way that is. So I haven't read the books,something tells me I do need to do that. But I should not read the books to make sense of it all. I judge solely on what I see on the screen. Why would the Dark Lord be so afraid of Harry Potter. Not once an explanation is given for it which I believe the books do (somebody told me). It really is beyond me that people can call this the best Harry Potter movie ever. Excuse me? Was there actually a plot? The scenes that were interesting were over before I could get into it. Please give this a miss. It is a waste of time.",0
17,7.0,"In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the ""children's fantasy"" genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation. ",1
18,3.0,"The ending is closer and the movies are worse. Still they are trying to make an action film out of Harry Potter, but what's worse is how the filmmakers clearly don't know what to cut. There is such a long time of... nothing. They do nothing. There's some dialogue but it's not always entirely insightful. And there's the weird dance scene and all that. Yes, those scenes how Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the run for a really long time, but that's really frustrating for the audience. How about you cut that and make this film shorter - or better yet - include some things that were in the books but were barely mentioned in the movie.",0
19,5.0,I guess I expected a lot more from this film - it's long and drug out way to long on unnecessary scenes like the wedding for example. I realize this is a two part film but to drag out the first film with a bunch of filler scenes really bored me.,0
20,5.0,"And so here it is finally. After nine years watching the prepubescent speccy wizard grow into a chiselled speccy wizard, the long, long climax is here. Kicking off what has become a fad in novel adaptations aimed mainly at screaming teenage girls (Twilight, The Hunger Games), Deathly Hallows splits the final novel into two 120-plus films. Whether this is to avoid condensing a mammoth, multi-character into one rushed, incoherent stand-alone movie, or to take full advantage of a multi- billion franchise that is soon to finally end, is up for debate (although a sneaky feeling tells me it's the latter). What is for certain is that a huge, dragging chunk of Part 1 could have easily been wavered. It's like director David Yates forgot that this series is supposed to be fun.",1
21,10.0,Almost a decade has passed since Harry first encountered Hogwarts. The long anticipated battle between Harry and Voldemort is drawing near. Hogwarts has become no more safe haven. The Ministry has set Harry as a fugitive. The beginning of the end has begun. ,1
22,3.0,"This is one of those movies that causes you to reach deep down in yourself and think. For example, I was thinking, ""Did I turn off the iron? Why did I pay so much for popcorn?"" I'm sure the producers were thinking, ""Hey, they are so far into it now, we can throw up any thing on the screen and still make buckets of money. But let's have Daniel Radcliff take off his shirt so they won't know they've been suckered."" Even if you're read the book and watched the other movies, the plot is incomprehensible. The movie consists of a bunch of action sequences strung together with no regard for the story.",0
23,10.0,"I would like to start off by saying that I am reviewing this movie as simply a movie - none of my opinions here will be associated with the book, and I will not discuss whether or not this film is a good adaptation of the book.<br /><br />If I had to pick a Harry Potter movie to watch at any given time, I will always suggest this film due to how different it is from every other film in the franchise. It is an excellent movie, not just in the Harry Potter series, but in general due to its cinematography, score, tone, and emotion.<br /><br />The tone of this movie follows the trend of the films getting progressively darker as they go on, with this film by far being the most depressing yet. Similar to the Half Blood Prince, this film has a dark tint to it, which I think was needed considering the light hearted nature of the first few films. It reminds us that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer kids, and the world is falling apart day by day. The stakes are higher than ever for the Golden Trio as Voldemort rages on.<br /><br />One of the biggest reasons I love this movie is because its main focus is on the trio, and there is some really good character development here. Ron gets some serious development for once, as we see him explain to a naive Harry that the war against Voldemort is bigger than just him and his world early on. We also see him struggle with the pressure and frustration of the trio's quest to destroy the Horcruxes, and the scene where he returns to Hermione and Harry is quite heart warming. We get to see Hermione try her best to be the glue of the group while Harry and Ron fight it out, but we soon see the stress of their situation get to her as well. It is amazing to see how far the three main characters have grown, and Grint, Watson, and Radcliffe give their best performances yet.<br /><br />This film has some of the best scenes in the series. I think the wedding sequence was done very well (despite somewhat cringe dialog between Harry and an old woman), as it reminds you that the main cast don't have any time for celebrations anymore. The following scene in a Muggle restaurant was shot stunningly, and the absence of any score really immerses you into the scene.The Ministry of Magic sequence is genuinely hilarious (Ron gets a little too into character), and is every bit enjoyable as it is thrilling towards the end when the three attempt to escape the Ministry. I love every moment of our trio's camping trip, and there are some really gorgeous landscape shots used as transitions. The chase scene through the forest is exhilarating, and again, the lack of score in the scene is gripping. The tales of the three brothers was beautifully animated, and is an example of the several risks that David Yates took in this film. The scene where Harry and Hermione stand in the Godric's Hollow graveyard is one of the best in the series and is quite touching.<br /><br />A lot of people dislike the infamous Harry and Hermione dance scene, but honestly, I thought it was great. It's an incredibly sad scene as we see how depression has struck our main characters; Harry and Hermione try their best to remember happiness after the devastating loss of their best friend, but it quickly fades as the two snap back to the reality of their depressing situation.<br /><br />The main criticism of this film seems to be that ""it's too slow"" or ""not much happens"", but I would argue that the people who make these comments are missing the point of this movie. This movie is less about the action and more about who Harry, Ron, and Hermione are as people and how they cope with their struggles (even though the action in this movie is great. It's a depressing film, and there are a lot of long shots of the three characters talking to each other because that's the point of this movie. The characters are depressed, finding the Horcruxes seems impossible to them, and as a viewer you experience their frustration. I feel like the production team easily could have made an action packed final film instead of splitting the last two books, but I'm glad they didn't because it allowed for excellent character moments. I am glad that Yates didn't simply go for the easy way out, and that he wasn't afraid to make a slower paced film. And no, this movie wasn't a ""cash grab"", because it is simply too good of a film to be.<br /><br />Lastly, I would like to point out that there is and never will be a franchise of the size of the Harry Potter series where all the films are at least decent movies on their own (some of them being outstanding). You will never see another blockbuster series eight films long that has as much artistic integrity as the eight Harry Potter movies, and that's what makes the Harry Potter films so special.",1

25,4.0,"After I'd seen the sixt Potter movie, I thought they would improve on the pace in this (part 1) seventh movie. But boy, was I wrong. I was so bored after the very well done beginning of the movie. Voldemort's meeting and the motorcycle chase were very exciting, but then it started again just like in part six...the very very slow scenes about how Harry thinks he's so alone and he and his friends don't know what to do...blablabla. Really, I have to see the second part of the seventh book, just because I have to know how it all ends, but the director is giving me a really hard time. I like the wonderous world of Harry Potter, but not like this. Personally, I think the fourth part was by far the most exciting of the Potter movies. OK, now let's sum up what I liked about this seventh movie: -The beginning (Voldemort's meeting and motorcycle chase) -The overall look of the movie (sets, lighting, etc.) -The Deadly Hallows story sequence -The casting. Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses Now, things that I didn't like: -The pace...ow my goodness. And I thought Gone with the Wind was slow or for instance Dr. Zhivago or Signs. -Ron thinking Harry has the hots for Hermione and fighting about it. Jeez...this was so forced. I mean, Harry already knew in the 5th and certainly in the 6th movie that Ron liked Hermione and Harry already had it going with Ginny. This was so stupid and boring. -How many items do they actually need to kill Voldemort. 7 Horcruxes that can be destroyed by a sword and than you also have the 3 Deadly Hallows. My goodness...in a computer game OK...but in a movie?! -When it became clear the neckless was making people angry I wanted to shout: ""Cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom!"" Damn, this was such a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. -And yeah, there we have it again...all those damn unoriginal references to WW2. As Basil Fawlty would say: ""Don't mention the war!"" -There were so many moments in this movie that it seemed like the story progressed simply by chance. -The introduction of Dobby again and his utterly useless and overemotional death. He dies and the movie tries to make us feel so sad because he was such a lovable and important character...NOT! Maybe in the books, but when you've only seen the movies like I have, Dobby's not really a character that I established an emotional band with during the last six movies. -The movie took itself too serious, but that's probably what the tone of the book is too. A little more wonder and innocence would have been nice. The humor was so scarce. As The Joker said in The Dark Knight: ""Why so serious?!"" ",0
26,3.0,"Gosh, I thought, trying to stay awake through the middle of the film, who puts a half-hour camping trip in the middle of a movie? Just maybe the answer is JK Rowling in her first try at movie production. Is that a spoiler to say so? I don't know.",0
27,5.0,"I've heard a lot of people say that reviewing the newest Harry Potter movie is a pointless exercise. By now, people have made up their minds regarding the film series. If they are on-board, then they'll see it regardless, and if they don't like it, they aren't going to make an exception for the newest one. That's fair enough, but it's not a sentiment I necessarily agree with.",0
28,10.0,"The most potent of the established rhythmic norms surrounding the previous six Harry Potter films was the inclusion of a stirring occurrence at the beginning to get things going, a more sedate and steadily-paced poignant build-up in the middle and a very rewarding climax at the end. This winning format also applies to the series as a whole: Philosopher's Stone serves as an introduction, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire push the saga along with great gusto, Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince reflect the escalating tensions and finally the two Deathly Hallows films bring things to a stunningly satisfying riveting conclusion. Fans have followed the series as the characters, the films, the books, the iconic actors and they themselves have matured bit by wondrous bit, and now they deserve a final stupendous culmination.",1
29,10.0,"I just got home from watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I will try not to give any spoilers, but I thought it was one of the best movies yet. I thought moreover that it was fairly loyal to the book for once, as far as it was possible. I thought the tension build up was very good throughout the movie, I liked seeing the characters being slightly more matured. There are some new kind of 'special effects' in the movie, which was kind of weird to me at first, but I guess it fitted the story. I can't wait to see part two , even though I know what will happen.",1

32,4.0,"Is it part art film? I'd say yes, in the better parts, it had something wise and melancholy going for it, rather like the book, but it was lost all too easily to the infrequent action sequences which neither impress nor lend any forward motion, aside from a particular part of the Bagshot/Nagini sequence making the audience jump a couple feet, and all without Voldemort. Meh.",0
33,8.0,"A lot slower paced than the others, which isn't a flaw. The acting and action is great. It is good to see some change within the characters but it felt like just another setup movie that leads into the big finale.",1
34,6.0,"I really wasn't sure what to feel watching this movie. Having read the book, I knew the story, who the characters where, and what was going to happen. But it was still emotionally confusing. There isn't really a moment in this movie where you're allowed to fully feel the moment of what is happening. For every moment that should be happy or triumphant, such as Ron breaking the horcrux, you immediately have a scene reminding the characters of the sobering reality of their situation. The story piles on hardship after hardship. The action move very fast, with some of the sequences I enjoyed in the book going by so quick I didn't feel like I had the chance to savor them and look for all the details I had waited for (the first chase when Harry leaves home, for example). And that's pretty much how it continued. And actually that's basically how the book went. So you can say that this movie was extremely faithful to the source material, probably as much as any film adaption ever has been. I think I was maybe looking for the movie to provide something that the book didn't--maybe to help me realize how I felt about this story which just seemed to happen, without allowing me to feel a proper release after all the buildup. I am excited for part 2, even knowing how everything will turn out, but this time I won't expect the film to solve any of my issues for me.",1

Trailing along are Jason Isaacs, Brendan Gleeson, Rhys Ifans and Alan Rickman with perhaps 3 minutes each, David Thewlis with 2 minutes and Timothy Spall with about the same.

36,4.0,"This is not a Harry Potter movie. It is a movie that has characters with the same names and faces but they are in an alternative universe, one created by David Yates starting in movie 5. In that universe, all the themes and ideas developed in the book-based Harry Potter mythology are gone. In its place is a story about an individual boy wizard and his teen friends. What happened to the great choices Harry has to make, like does he go after the Horcruxes as Dumbledore instructed or does he get sidetracked looking for the Deathly Hallows? Horcruxes are thrown in as a McGuffin, an excuse to take a group camping trip rather than as the key to the whole mystery: how do you destroy evil without destroying yourself. The Hallows are the great temptation that the animation in this movie beautifully suggests but then they are completely ignored for the rest of the movies. Remember that Dumbledore and Gregorovich once had a notion of ""The Greater Good"" and that idea did not die with the end of their friendship. Dumbledore tried to teach Harry that what he was doing was not for himself, it was for the greater good of all beings, not just pure-bloods, and certainly not just for teenagers. Okay, did you get any of this from this movie? NO, because it has all been washed out of the story and replaced with silly teen anxieties and individual relationships. How very sad.",1
37,8.0,"Though it can't avoid an element of place-setting as the over-long book is split over two films, this is less drawn out than I remember. The camping scenes are needlessly long, but the wartime, almost apocalyptic atmosphere is brilliantly constructed; the dread hanging over the central characters and ever-encroaching darkness is palpable; I found the litany of names of missing wizards on the radio especially effective. The influence of Tolkein is strong here also in terms of plot, themes and world-building.",1

The films have been breathtaking, brilliant, beautiful, with one of the greatest ensemble casts I have ever seen. They didn't just play their roles but single handedly embodied them. So I was excited and sad to see this second last instalment of the last great fantasy epic. How disheartening to discover that this was nothing more than a forced first part to the two part finale to squeeze more money out of the franchise. 95% of all the characters that made this series incredible are gone. The action, special effects, and brilliant fantasy is practically nil. I read several reviews on IMDb and some loved it and many hated it and the ones who hated it said the same things I thought about it. The starring cast spend the entire film 'warping' out of trouble and into forest. ""Harry Potter goes camping"" as one reviewer called it. The amazing supporting cast from previous instalments get virtually no time on screen and the entire 2 1/2 hour film could have been summarized into a half hour before the final film.

54,1.0,"I'm glad I am not the only one that thought this was the most boring - and worst of the Harry Potter franchise. That is dragged out over two hours made it worse. The three main characters had lost their spark and almost looked bored and tired themselves. There were some very dark undertones about death and had this been around when my kids were young, I would have hesitated to let them see this. Mind you I think they would have given up after the first half hour.",0
55,1.0,"Sadly, Kloves and Yates took Rowling's richly detailed character driven story and turned into an action film. I found myself surprised at the realization a couple weeks ago that I had just finished reading the last installment of the Harry Potter books for a third time. Admittedly, I have not yet read the first four books; coincidentally, the first four movies, I liked. The last three books, I've read and perhaps not so coincidentally, I was disappointed by the films for all three (so far - in as much as the last book has been split into two parts). Rowling's writings of the books are very rich in detail, detail which illustrates quite beautifully the nuances of the relationships that the characters have with one another and thus offer the understanding for the how and why of the characters' development. Key details in Rowling's novels set up plot points and history for the subsequent novels. In The Half Blood Prince, the movie, Ginny leads Harry into the Room of Requirement to hide the potions book. In the novel, Harry decides to hide the book to avoid having it confiscated after using a curse hand-written in the book against Draco Malfoy. The importance of this change is in the final book, when Harry is looking for the Horcruxes he recalls having seen the Diadem of Ravenclaw on the bust perched on the cabinet in which he hid the book. Now that the movie has altered this happening, they've removed the setup for Harry finding one of the final Horcruxes in the Room of Requirement. Details such as these go towards showing the definition of the characters themselves...how Harry is different from Voldemort is his remarkable capacity to love in spite of all that he has suffered. He cares for his friends, whereas Voldemort has no friends. The ""lessons"" that Dumbledore has with Harry in the sixth book are important for Harry to learn all that he can to understand Tom Riddle and how he became Voldermort so that he will know how to defeat him. In the movie, these ""lessons"" are completely glossed over and there is no great understanding offered into Riddle's background and history. Like the comment Dumbledore makes about Tom keeping souvenirs, this is a clue for Harry when trying to figure out what objects Voldemort selected as his Horcruxes. In the book, The Order of the Phoenix, the members of Dumbledore's Army communicate via the enchanted Galleons, no mention of this at all in the movie and yet this is key for how the students communicate whilst at school in the last book while waging war. I do understand that the films would be way too long if they all followed the books to the letter, however, let me offer Sir Peter Jackson and his translation of Tolkien's critically acclaimed classic literature into three fantastic epic films that do absolute justice the books with exceptional scripts and filmmaking. Yates and Kloves would have done well to pause for a moment and asked if they were making action movies or were they trying to tell the story of Harry Potter. To me, filmmaking is storytelling in its own right. Granted, a book depends upon the imagination of the readers' to create a picture with the words on the page, while film removes the necessity of imagination because the picture is painted for the viewer via the interpretation of the filmmaker. Yet, in my opinion, Yates took too much liberty with the stories and changed them without regard to how it limited the understanding of the characters, their development, and the choices that they made. I could go on and on because there are so many more instances where the details cut from the books for the movies diminish the robustness of the characters that Rowling created, but to what end really? There was no mention of the relationship of the House Elf Kreacher with Harry and how much it had changed after Harry showed Kreacher the smallest of kindnesses by giving him the fake locket. How Kreacher then starting cooking wholesome comforting meals for the three friends while they were doing reconnaissance at the Ministry of Magic. Had the filmmakers chosen to show the time that Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent going back and forth under the cloak one at a time; shown how they had to move every time they said Voldemort's name because it had been ""tabooed""; then Ron's defection and subsequent return would have been more logical, understandable, and forgivable. Had they shown in the last film that the students were fighting already when Harry and Dumbledore returned, introduced Fleur and Bill which sets up the wedding in the next film; shown the gravity of Bill's injuries, shown the strain for Tonks and Lupin. These moments were all in the books, and they are all integral parts of the story that the movies do not tell. The movies just barely skim the surface on these and many other points almost in arrogance with the assumption that a split second on screen is sufficient for the suspension of disbelief....in the case of a movie in the genre of fantasy, the suspension of disbelief is not so much the goal as is character development in the hopes that the audience is invested in the characters and wants to join them on the journey. This quality is missing from this film as well as the others that Yates and Kloves have done in the series. I want to say to them - it's not just all about the cool special effects gentlemen, the Harry Potter series is in fact an exploration of character, the depth of humanity in the face of death and the sacrifices one is willing to make for their friends and loved ones time and again despite tragedy; it's about the triumph of the human spirit and the capacity to love. See the film if you must, but just know, it's the missed the mark.",1

Many expeditions, adventures, and sad points in this story but as far as we know, Harry Potter after the Goblet of Fire, Harry POtter films have become darker, darker, and dark to the point I would say that this is not a fictional movie but a horror, fiction, thriller it will keep you wanting to have your hands over your eyes, waiting to see the next scene of death and more.

So many characters were left out, scenes were torn apart and replaced with ones that were only decipherable by a few key phrases, but I think the all around worst scenes of this movie would have to be in the scenes at Xeno Lovegood's house, the snatchers (greyback is completely cut out of the story line) the wedding (very quickly done with no time taken to really give it the beauty it deserved) and above all else, Malfoy manor when Dobby helps them escape. (Bellatrix bites into Hermione's arm the word mud blood and doesn't torture her, and she keeps her wand, and wormtail doesn't kill himself. Also fairly disappointing was any and all scenes in the black house. It was a very good movie, but not for those who were lovers of the book.

I'm a completeistâ€”I've read all seven Harry Potter books, and I plan to see all eight Harry Potter movies. I steeled myself: ""Just get through itâ€”the final one will be GREAT."" Well, I'm kind of disappointed that I wasn't disappointed. After all, the final book in the series is definitely not one of my favorites, and I knew the almost total absence of Snape, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts would certainly diminish this film. What we're left with is Harry, Hermione, and Ron on the run for almost the entire film, with prolonged cameos by heretofore minor characters. But what this set-up does (and more effectively than the book does, I might argue) is foreground the relationship among these characters and how it has evolved throughout the series. There is nothing childish about their complex entanglements with each other, and the intensity of their performances (especially Rupert Grint's) is very impressive. The film is, by necessity, incompleteâ€”the conclusion is more like a dramatic pause. And yes, the entire thing is one huge teaseâ€”but it's the best kind of tease, because you know there'll be a great payoff well worth the waitÂ…even if it is seven months away.",0

However this review is meant for those hardcore harry potter fans. I was very disappointed throughout the whole movie, not that the movie was poorly done or anything, but the one thing i felt was the biggest flaw in the movie was they kind of rushed everything and they kind of left some important parts to the movie, not just in terms of story line but emotional depth that you feel when you read the book but of course this could be my bias talking. I have heard some people who haven't read the book say this movie was fantastic so i would say that the movie does somewhat compensate for the rushed story line with a fantastic movie yet i was still not completely satisfied. I understand the previous movies were made before the 7th book was even published so its difficult for the writers and producers to get in the mind of J.K rowling and put in every detail that will be important later yet i felt that those details that got left out and that were squeezed into the 7th movie kind of made it seem like in order for it to be included they had to take out some stuff. For instance they barely introduced Bill, which should have been done in the 4th movie, and they barely introduce mundungus which should have been done during the 5th movie, so we kind of lose essence what kind of character bill and mundungus are, and i feel this detail is what made the wedding in the movie seem so unimportant which was actually an important detail in the book because the wedding did a lot of stuff for the story, by having krum it introduces Ron's jealousy in the story, and also provides detail about gregorovitch the wandmaker, and shows the controversy of the mark on luna's dad's necklace and also contributes to harry's curiosity to dumbledore's life. also in the beginning scene when they're transporting harry they made hedwig dying as a giveaway to the real harry instead of the explleriamus charm in the book which is more symbolic. anyways thats just some of the things that i felt shouldn't have been changed, there are a lot more. So my advice is if you read the book don't expect this movie to match your expectations because its understandable that they have to consider the audience that doesn't read the book, but overall i guess this movie was pretty good.",0

It actually could have been cut in half without leaving any important scenes out. When you're not watching Harry and Hermione sit around doing nothing, then you're watching Ron, Harry and Hermione sit around doing nothing. The scenes were soooooo drawn out, hardly any action, barely any special effects...just awful. I can't believe how many people said it was great on here because the theater I was in was packed and not a single person in there looked happy after the movie. I found myself paying more attention to the popcorn crunching noises, kids talking, and other commotion in the audience than I was to the actual movie. Plus I actually dozed off twice!!

Like all Harry Potter movies, the story makes sense, there are little to no plot holes, it has great acting and a great story. As it is the first half of a book, the story is quite slow and dragged on compared to other HP movies and for that reason it suffers.

On one side it was nice to see every aspect was covered with minute details but on the other side it got little stretched and boring. This time again, it was more story and less magic. At one point I thought I'm watching Lord of the Rings rather than Harry potter as the last scenery seems just like it! The graphics used in telling the story of Three Deadly Hallows was truly fantastic, I was just lost in beauty of those graphics. Excellent Job! Daniel Redcliff, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint did a fantastic mature job as actors. Overall, deadly hallow was an almost a perfect part 1 towards the ending of our Beloved Harry Potter.",1

Hermione confides that these woods are as she remembered, but ""We have changed"". Much has changed in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"". Gone are the days of innocence and the wonder of youth in the pursuit of true magic. ""Deathly Hallows"" veers dour and menacing. The Dark Lord Voldemort (charismatic evil Ralph Fiennes) declares, ""I shall be the one to kill Harry Potter!"" In this dark envisioning of J.K. Rowling's final book: It is now ""time to put away childish things"". David Yates expertly directs this, and the concluding Part 2, as he did in the previous 2 movies. ""Deathly Hallows"" is more craft than art.",1
114,1.0,"First of all I'm a fan of HP, have been since I was the same age the actors were when they started this movie venture because of J.K's awesome ability to write her world and bring it to life through them. However, I have never been a big fan of the movies because, obviously, they can never capture the true essence of the books. Key word: Essence; not every boring camping trip that happens. Although it's true the the bigger the books got the more the movies were rushed to get to key points and events. Although I'm trying to discern why that was not the case with this movie. I was truly and more irrevocable disappointed with this film as NOTHING HAPPENED! You spent most watching them camp and wander about and when you did reach the part where they destroyed the Horcrux it was so uneventful and disturbing. I'm sorry to say, but the image Ron saw was not needed to the full explicitly that was displayed. It makes me wonder how the actors felt seeing that; I mean yes, it is technically their characters and it was manipulated using CGI but still, was that really necessary? The 30mins where something ACTUALLY happened could have been incorporated into an actual film. This splitting the movie into two parts just to make more money from this franchise is despicable, especially in these economic times. We want something worth our money, not something else to waste it on and make us think we should have just splurged on those new shirts or something. I'd rather wait for it's TV debut on the movie network then either waste mine or my parents money on a 4-5hr movie where nothing happens for half of it instead of purchasing it like the other six. For shame, Warner Brothers and David Yates, for shame.",0

The deadly Hallows is better than the last in terms of action and intensity.

I have read all the Harry Potter books and this interpretation of the 7th and final book is very accurate and does not leave out any major detail,I know that a lot of people are upset that Warner Bros. decided to make this final book into two separate movies but maybe its better this way, it allows the viewers to get the most detail of what happens in the book, and it allows the filmmakers to express the most detail of the final chapter of the Harry Potter series.",1
117,7.0,Finally my review for the last installment of Harry Potter well part one anyway. First I would like to say how glad I am they released this movie in two parts. I personally think they should have done that with every book after the third if they did they would have been able to make it much closer to the book and therefore and much better and complete movie like this one was. The acting was the best yet out of all the movies and the story is getting very intense also it seems the writing has improved drastically with the dialouge and screenplay.,1

Not to mention losing a very old friend in the process. Ronald also nearly loses his mind which has him abandon the group only to reunite soon after. This movie holds a drastic amount of emotions which all can relate to. This shows what the wizards themselves are becoming, and some do not find the change all that appealing. Especially the Malfoy Family. Though encouraging and tempting the fates of Voldemort may be, there is a fine line between true evil, and those who are just bystanders. With Voldemort, his vision is to become the most powerful of all wizards, and Harry is nearly at his ropes end and losing hope. What a great addition to the most successful movies in history.

Whenever a new film comes out, there is always a certain criticism that a book fan will mention because of certain information or details left out of the film adaptation. Being the final book in the famous wizard series, this would always be the hardest book to adapt, so I was very relieved when it was announced that it would be split into two parts. Some might see this as an attempt to cash in money, but I honestly do not believe it was for that reason. The filmmakers care about this story, and being the finale, they care about adding in character development before the big action-packed finale. So after seeing Part 1, I have the obligation not just to judge it as a film adaptation but also as a film.",0

138,6.0,"It was unbearably boring, for nearly an hour & a half its just Harry & Hermione walking around & talking, not even talking about anything important. Every other character in the movie just shows their face once each then leaves, little to no dialogue at all. The entire film focused (if you can call it that! Most the camera work was jumpy & unfocused!) On Hermione & Harry w/ Ron kinda just hanging around not doing much. Too many unanswered questions they didn't bother to even try to explain, little to no new information at all was given, then it just up & ends out of no where. I know this was meant to be a tease to bring you back for the last one but if I wasn't a fan of the series I most likely wouldn't come back. It was a slap in the face to all the fans & an insult to all the other films. From what I saw you could basically skip this one & move right on to the last one without skipping a beat or getting angry and mad like I did. I've really liked all the other movies but this one was God awful & I do blame the director, just another example of Hollywood politics sticking it's nose where it doesn't belong. Clearly it was a ploy to create a money grab situation and completely ignore any effort to make a quality film. I've noticed even in the previews they show scenes that aren't even IN this movie but the next one. Making people, I'm sorry SHEEPLE, think their getting something they're not. Pathetic, simply pathetic. It made some bank over the weekend so it fooled acres of sheep. Since this one was so successful, I heard some executive remark that they should've broken up all the films into two parts. Apparently half would contain them talking and the other would be purposeful.",0
139,8.0,"This film is a nice break from the hectic pacing of the last ones. Ever since the third film, when 2 1/2 hours became much too short for an adequate adaptation of the books, the movies have been rather loveless attempts to squeeze just enough information into the limited time to allow for a superficial understanding of the main story lines. This one, on the other hand, takes its times, which is its greatest strength, and stays rather close to the book. On multiple occasions I was really surprised when another detail that wasn't strictly necessary to the main plot was graciously allowed its space.",1

But the Deathly Hallows part 1 broke the mould. It was a complete waste of time. I felt at times like I was watching a documentary about some bored kids camping in the woods. The whole film could neatly have been summarised in a conversation at the start of the second film so I can only conclude this film was purely driven by financial greed. While a book can get away with this vast periods of inactivity I'm afraid if you haven't read the book then it is incredibly tedious in a film. Unlike previous films, nothing really happens. I often go to the cinema and afterwards we discuss our ""favourite"" scenes. When we left this film someone asked me what I enjoyed about it and I actually struggled to think of something that happened that I could talk about it. My advice, if you haven't read the books, skip this and wait for Part 2 which I assume will be better. I did ask for my money back but I will never get those 3 hours back.",0

Instead I got Harry and Hermione zapping from one place to another with seemingly no purpose, little to nearly none plot or character development, etc. Also, there were yet more questions asked (instead of the kind of answers you'd like to find in a penultimate film of a very long franchise), and - to top it all - major characters died off-screen (who does that?), and again, I didn't really see what point this served.",0
146,8.0,Part 1 is not a bad movie by any means. It's just all the stuff fans want to see isn't until part 2. It is an entertaining film with a lot of good scenes particularly the ending as well as the fight scenes with the wands and when they move Harry Potter to a safe location. There are a ton of lulls in this movie particularly when they are hiding out in the woods and it's just the 3 actors on screen. You could see this as a cash grab movie but in retrospect every Harry POtter movie could have been split into 2 given how long the books are.,0

After the Half-Blood Prince, I didn't expect ANTHING from this movie, the adaptation from the 6th book to the screen has to be worst one I've ever seen in my entire life, I was truly disappointed, as I haven't been a fan of HP movies since probably the 2nd one. But I truly have to say that this movie blew my mind. Every essential, detailed part of the book is seen on the film, and it's perfectly introduced for the second part of it. I had honestly forgot how it felt like to compare things I've read from HP to what I was seeing on the screen, but I did this through the entire film. The movie is dark, which is contrasted by funny moments, is deep,is truly a flawless adaptation from the book and I couldn't be more pleased about it. I will recommend this movie to all HP fans and also to the people who haven't read the books because it is a great movie, and the actors are perfectly chosen and do an amazing job.",0

So I went in hoping that wasn't true and I was not disappointed. The whole movie just works - and it follows the book so closely, I couldn't help but be happy throughout. If you're an avid Harry Potter book lover who has been terribly disappointed by the way the movies only use the crux of the books, then this movie is for you. It literally starts almost the same way book 7 starts: ""The two men appeared out of nowhere.."" And it progresses in a way that's almost the exact same way it goes in the book except for a few things they removed to help in the progression of the story and some things they added to make the viewer understand what's going on. A friend of mine went in with me having not watched any Harry Potter movie. And after the question or two of ""what is a horecrux"" and ""who's this"" she got into the movie and now can't wait for part 2. This is the best one in the Harry Potter franchise so far. I give it a 10 because I love Harry and because this is one of my favorite movies this year. You should definitely go watch it!",0
158,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (2010): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter: First part of an exciting franchise conclusion. There is an interesting back story regarding what the Deathly Hallows refers too but symbolically is makes no real claims. The young heroes are older and the evil lord Voldemort wants young wizard Harry Potter dead so to avoid this Potter is put under protection. Eventually they are on a quest to destroy a locket that contains part of Voldemort's soul. Director David Yates is a veteran in these films and here he nears the characters closer to doom. The ending is a cliffhanger but a satisfactory one where self sacrifice becomes the norm. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter is at his most responsible as he takes charge of his life to face the inevitable. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasily struggles with emotions that cause friction but he renders his biggest victory when faced with deception. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is invaluable with her intelligence and well placed magic. Finally there is Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort whose presence is ominous in his search for a powerful wand that can out match Potter's. His final scene opens the door nicely for part 2. It also should be noted that Helena Bonham Carter plays one hell of a superb psychotic bitch. These films were always entertaining but young children need discernment before viewing. Fantastic special effects abound include an exciting motorcycle chase through the skies, looming large serpents, and an enchanting world full of surprises. Score: 7 / 10",1

I'm guessing more money vs. story, I mean come on, you know that Hollywood is bummed since these films are guaranteed money makers, and what a bad influence; it inspired Twilight to do so as well. Anyways I digress, since I've only seen each film only once and never read the books, I have to admit that I was confused throughout the film, thankfully I rented this one and watched it a couple of times, but to me, unless you're a die hard fan, this was the duller Harry Potter film I've seen of the bunch. This is basically the Harry Potter Project where the trio is just walking around the woods just trying not to get killed and learning how to survive.

By that point, the books were long past the simpler tales of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", and as a result they inevitably glossed over so many key parts of the series.

One thing is that every new movie there is something different they try and it either wins or fails. This movie had both. The win was focusing on the main characters more as grown ups than as kids and it really worked. I felt like I was watching more of an adult fantasy type movie. The fail was the use of action scenes. They tried the whole, ""shaking the camera"" to add special effect and more of the real to the action shots. This really took away from the film and even started giving me a headache. I am glad it was not in 3D because I probably would of passed out. The cast was still great and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson blossom with each movie. The rest of the characters are fun to watch as always and a joy to see act. This film is darker than most of the other movies and did have some more passion towards characters too. So I did enjoy how it was filmed, but not the shaking camera. One more Harry Potter to go and it is over.

171,5.0,"Well, we're on to the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, though somehow, despite the six preceding films and a forthcoming Part Two, it feels a little too soon. How can something still seem abrupt when it's been developing for almost ten years? One way, which I consider largely responsible in this case, is to procrastinate about developing the big bad. Voldemort enjoys an appropriately in-depth history in the books, though even there he moves in the shadows and rarely appears in the flesh, but in films he's been almost an afterthought. A victim of the constant trims and clips that have leeched depth from the print editions for years. I always figured they'd get around to him eventually, but now we're in the endgame and named characters are dying and it's quickly become clear that we aren't going to get much more insight than ""no nose / killed parents / generally mean guy."" Which is odd, considering how much care and effort went into defining and expanding the story's huge, diverse supporting cast.",0
172,7.0,"I've always had a bit of a beef with ""Deathly Hallows,"" the final novel in J.K. Rowling's lucrative franchise. My main issue is that nothing much happened (or, perhaps more accurately, nothing happened that the discerning reader couldn't spot from 100 pages away). Kill off a marginal character here, throw in a Christ allegory there. And don't get me started on that epilogue! Even so, I approached Part 1 of the final cinematic chapter with a mind uncluttered by prejudice or preconception. I've always thought the reins should have been passed onto a new director for each film, but David Yates at least redeemed himself for the rushed 'Order of the Phoenix (2007)' with 'Half Blood Prince (2009),' which chose its tone and then stuck to it.",0
173,,"I suppose it was inevitable. As J. K. Rowling became a phenomenon her books got less and less editing though they needed it more and more. With the cynical, money-grubbing decision to make two films out of the last book a similar thing has happened. The triangular friendship and love of Ron, Hermione and Harry provides the personal, human tension of the over-all story but we all know that it can't be resolved until the last chapter/reel. The consequence is this movie bloated with empty calories to deprive us of the price of a ticket bought more to say we've seen the whole epic rather than because we've been truly entertained. We get a few loose ends tied up and a brilliant animated sequence telling the back story of the Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately more of the movie than any narrative line can stand consists of the three young people wandering the English countryside to no particular purpose except to pad out the space between opening and closing credits. At best the film is an over-long trailer for the final installment. Poor Harry and his friends haven't been this badly served since the series wisely, thankfully jettisoned director Chris Columbus and his attempts to drag the series down into the hell of Home Alone with witches. The best I can say of this film is that someday, in order to sell more copies of the series, someone may re-cut the films and combine Deathly Hallows Parts I & II into something like a watchable film. I have no confidence in that, however. The fashion is to add scenes that were left on the cutting room floor and, usually, should have made it to the cutting room incinerator. I am a father of the children of the Harry Potter generation and thus once removed from Potter-mania. Still I also have a deep affection for Daniel Radcliffe's and his Harry, Emma Watson and her Hermione and Rupert Grint and his Ron. I have watched them grow as I watched my daughters grow. Thus it's partly out of fatherly affection that I dislike this installment as a great disservice to three young actors who have worked hard and deserved better.",0
174,2.0,"I'm a big HP fan; I have the books and I've seen all the movies, but I think this one was the worst of the lot so far. It's one thing to make a movie out of a book, but when you have Rowling material, don't chop it up! The first two movies were good, but beginning with the third, it's like the filmmakers just weren't into it; things began going down drain from there, and each installment kept getting a little bit worse.",0
175,,"I haven't always been kind to the film adaptations of the Harry Potter books because they always seemed to be missing something. J.K. Rowling created a world on the page that was robust and alive, populated by dozens of interesting characters and wondrous things to behold. The movies, mainly after the second installment seemed to miss the point. They always felt like Cliff Notes summaries. That's a complaint I've had with this series for about the last four installments. Yet, here we are at the end and at last they've gotten it absolutely right. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is the beginning of the end, the top half of a two-part finale that concludes in July. This is the best installment of the series, in my opinion, and the truest to Rowling's vision. Harry's destiny has been looming all along through some admittedly tiresome fore-bearings and now those portents of doom finally come to a head.",1
176,5.0,"There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the weakest entry in the Harry Potter franchise, which furthermore makes me doubt the weird decision of splitting this adaption into two separate films, since basically nothing ever happens in its 2 hour 26 running time.",0
177,2.0,"I used to love the Harry Potter movies more than most movies, and the reason to that is because they used to be magical, they felt like stories and fables. But the latest Harry Potter movies just down right suck. The reason to that is because they've lost all their magic, they've only reverted to CGI and seem to have put their focus there. The scenes look different from the other ones, the camera has a sickly annoying shake at most action scenes and the movie itself just hasn't got any intense moments at all. Plus after I saw it, I was expecting to somewhat understand the story, but apparently it didn't tell me squat. For example, I remember when they destroyed the necklace Horokrux which they'd got. After they had destroyed it, they said ""Good, now there are only four horokruxes left."" My damn question is, when he heck did they destroy the first three? One was tom riddles book and the other one was this necklace! Perhaps they did it in the Half Blood prince? If they did, them I must've missed it. But who can blame me? When the movie only was filled with over-dramatic scenes and an overdoing amount of CGI effects instead of story. So why blame me if I've missed it? But, let's get to a conclusion here. I didn't like the movie, nor do I recommend it to anyone who loved the first movies. I suggest you wait for Spielbergs animated series of harry potter.",0
178,6.0,"OK - they want to convey dark foreboding, and an air of mystery -- but Jeez -- staring at a black screen for half the movie, just doesn't do it for me. Give us a break and hire some electricians, spend some money on lights and power, and let us SEE JUST WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPENING, not just poorly lit photography. The first four films were enjoyable, but the last few were just not as good. Even after obtaining the dvds, and re-running scenes over and over to try and see just what was going on, these blacked out segments were not worth the effort. Couple that with the other annoying Hollywood technique of using jiggly hand-held cameras, and this last installment becomes a candidate for scrapping and re-shooting. David Yates, are you listening?? Don't waste film, talent, and time -- let us SEE your work, not guess at it.",0
179,6.0,"Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!",1
180,6.0,"I've always enjoyed the first Harry Potter movies up to the Prisoner of Azkaban, which in its time travel twist is in my opinion the best one of the series. However after that one every subsequent film has been progressively worse. That is the case with the Deathly Hallows (part 1) too.",1
181,1.0,"David Yates took the awesome fantasy world that Chris Columbus had began, and then ruined it with his dark grim atmosphere!",1
182,4.0,"My rating point is 4/10 (not so horrible). Some said it was a good story. Even my brother thought it was good. Between the seven Harry Potter movies I preferred the second and fifth one (I think). Like I said in my summary, it is not too much my taste. It was too strange. I never really fully understood the stories. Perhaps because I never read any of the books. Harry Potter isn't my kind. I will add only 1 Oscar for it for best special effects. The rest was so boring (sorry to say it). The actors are playing well. Harry Potter movies contain too much violent scenes. And it can make people very scarred. So I don't know if it is a good thing to add in a wizard film. Perhaps that's why I didn't appreciate Harry Potter. Good try anyway. Little kids shouldn't see this film because it is too violent and it is only allowed for 12 year old boys. I am fourteen, so I am allowed. It means that I am not a fan of Harry Potter films. Thank you for reading it! (it was an asperger review",0
183,6.0,"Whenever a Harry Potter book is converted into a movie (the name is enough to cast the magical spell on you even if you've not read any of Potter Books), the fans always have apprehensions. Read more to know why! As Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger prepare for their final showdown with Lord Voldemort and his brood of baddies â€“ which is stretched out to two chapters for the big screen â€“ we're thrust into an overcast world of fear, isolation and constant tent pitching in ""The Deathly Hallows.""",0
184,6.0,"Just watched this week and i'm not impressed with the film story direction. The series started out great as an all family can watch films but now this has been dropped for a miserable, depressing, drab direction which doesn't fit in at all with the other earlier films. I don't know what JKR is thinking when writing but maybe she was in a dark mood herself and took it out on Harry Potter? This needed the old spark of Harry Potter film magic but its too late now! How anyone would want to watch this film again is a mystery. JKR will hopefully take a break from writing and think about letting other authors write Harry Potter stories about Harry's earlier times at magic school which would be good to see?",1
185,3.0,"I'll start by saying i love the books and I'm impartial to the movies, but i thought this one would be different. Seeing as how they split it in to two parts i thought that would allow them to stay detailed and true to the book, this was not the case at all. Okay, so we all know that movies are never as good as the books that they are based on mainly because they tend to leave out the small details, but this movie completely betrayed the book. They missed so many plot forming concepts that the story seemed almost patched together, making many things forced upon the viewer in the form of awkwardly place bad script. I'll begin with my list of a few of the many things that they screwed up.",0
186,5.0,"The fantasy film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is directed by David Yates and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The film takes place all over the wizarding world.",1
187,5.0,"OK, watched Harry Potter's Deathly Hallows Part 1 last night. All I can say is, someone forgot to pay the light bill, it was a very dark movie. We missed almost half of it due to the darkness. You can see some movement, but you sure can't tell what is going on. We thought it must have been filmed in a cave.The parts we did see were good. Good acting as always, but it looked like Ron Weasley was working with 2 black eyes most of time. I don't understand why anyone would want to film a movie this way. It was almost like they were ashamed of the film, so darken it. We have purchased every Harry Potter movie and were extremely disappointed in this one. Hope Part II you will be able to see the whole movie, not just part of it.",1
188,6.0,"Worst of the Harry Potter series. The biggest problem to me seems that they wanted to save money on effects and actors by spending endless amount of time shooting outdoor forest fly-by scenes instead of including side plots and more special effects. The movie has about 30 minutes of outdoor scenes which could be completely removed. Also, there's a scene where Harry and Hermione dance that is supposed to be poignant, but I found it endless and pointless. I can't remember the last time I saw a non-musical movie which included a complete song. Usually they are shortened to show the highlights and move the story along, but not Deathly Hallows. I'll definitely not be too worried about buying the extended DVD! I'd actually pay extra for a better edited version.",0
189,1.0,"How can anyone say this was a good film? I like the books and the films are bearable because you like the books so much but this was just so poor. How has dan, emma and ruperts acting got worse in 10 years? Helena Bonham-Carter stole the show as Bellatix and showed the others how to act. Not once did i feel scared or sad for the characters, they seemed to move from scene to scene with no development!",0
190,7.0,"I have made a point of watching the movies, in order of course, and to say I have been disappointed is an understatement.Now I love fantasy movies and still think The Lord of the Rings Trilogy has yet to be bettered. I have found the HP franchise not good enough given the hype that surrounds them. That said I really quite enjoyed this first part of the final film - Daniel, Rupert and even Emma were so much better in this than the earlier films. The only other one I liked was The Order of the Phoenix even though it was about half an hour too long. The Deathly Hallows Pt 1 is a much more grown up movie and is the better for it. I would say it is even genuinely scary in parts. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is maturing as an actor and has had a difficult job carrying so many movies - if he had been no good then the whole thing would not have worked.",0
191,1.0,"I saw this movie yesterday, because my wife dragged me there. Yes, my expectations were not high to begin with, but I have been dragged to other movies before, including the first Harry Potter movie, so I thought I knew what to expect.",1
192,4.0,"Recently I have been watching the entire series for the first time and I have to say I enjoyed all the previous films. The 6th one though left a strange feeling that Rowling was running out of ideas and much of the good stuff was substituted with typical romance. I hoped something was stored for the final story but nope, a big disappointment here. The film feels like a really bad soap opera you are wishing to finally end but can't turn off because you are too much invested into the story. There is almost nothing to keep you entertained, the dialogues are especially lacking and there are lots of them. At the end I even started losing my sympathies towards the three heroes watching them running away from a mere gang of bandits (all of whom got disarmed by a single witch later) and even failing to do that. I mean come on, you are going to kill the almighty Voldemort and can't even stand up against those? And the elf being killed was the final nail in the film's coffin, so predictable and so cheap.",0

194,3.0,I've anticipated that being the last Harry potter they would divide this part into 2 separate ones (just like with the matrix) while in fact there is no other reason to do so other then make people spend their money twice.,0
195,7.0,"While the producers decided to cut the film based on the last Harry Potter novel into two parts as to maximize the revenue they could extract from the franchise, which has become the most lucrative film franchise of the last decades, the films that they made based on these two halves were quite good. They certainly weren't great films, unlike the Lord of the Rings, which was a truly great masterpiece of fantasy novel adapted into film. These Harry Potter films were competent but not masterpieces in any way shape of form. ",1
196,1.0,"The amount of cinematic bloat this movie has is enough to make any editor cry. Much like the order, this has practically nothing happening for 90% of the run time and all the important bits feel chopped into the smallest most condensed fractions of space that they could have given them. It's just flat out boring.",0
197,5.0,"I have read all the Harry Potter books, so I am familiar with the finer points of the plot. I am amazed at how people say that the film is faithful to the book. In my humble point of view, the movie really meandered here and there without providing any logical reasons for the actions of characters. OK here come the SPOILERS. The starting was good with the music of Desplat setting the tone for the impending dark times. But all the good work was undone for me with the scene for Harry looking into the broken mirror. He sees(or thinks he has seen) the face of Dumbledore and yet he is not even surprised..as if he has been seeing this every other day, it actually makes him look dumb. It is an important scene which links to later part of the movie. The chase scenes are pretty good but again, as Hedwig gives away Harry's identity (another departure from book) and Voldemort draws nearer, the spell his wand casts automatically seems to pass unnoticed by him (I said he's dumb..well,he's dumber). Boy, he never even asks anyone why did this happen. Given, he is dumb, is anyone sane enough to advise him to be in disguise during the wedding...apparently not. He just walks in full view and guess what, nobody's even surprised. I thought they might give Harry the credit of solving the mystery of RAB to show the brainy side of him but no, its Ron who just happens to wake up and show his rare genius. The story of Kreacher being used by Voldemort to the cave to hide his horcrux and the change of heart Kreacher had when the trio told him they were completing the unfinished task of Regulus Black was completely skipped. I think there was a lot of potential for laughs with the elf beating Mundungus but it too was wasted. Our dumb harry refuses to have any disguise on their trip to Godric's hollow as well though this time Hermione tried to put some saneness into his head but to no avail.(It would be better if Voldemort just kills this loser, he seem to be asking for it!). I was really astonished how far a character can be made to look foolish when Harry follows the doe Patronus without ever wondering who cast it and it may be a trap. But the biggest mystery I am yet to uncover is how those death eaters happened to be at the same place they disapparated to from Luna's house...they didn't even utter the tabooed ""Voldemort"" name.(Surely something to look for in part 2, perhaps?). I dunno why but Bellatrix wont use Cruciatus curse to torture Hermione but instead carves Mudblood on her arm and why did Hermione cry out so loud for this? After all, Harry bore all such trash in part 5 without any issues. They skipped the death of Wormtail as well. There really was no conviction and desperation in the way Harry takes out the broken mirror and asks for help. No doubt people do not seem to relate it to appearance of Dobby. There was a lot more missing in the movie but what really disgusts me is the way the director took liberty with some very important scenes that were vital to explaining the forthcoming events.",0
198,4.0,"This particular movie possesses many admirable qualities. Fine acting, exciting storyline etc. But for me the poor quality lighting of many crucial scenes out weighs all else and because of this I would give this movie a poorer than average rating. What good does all the rest mean,if you can't make out the picture? I watched the movie in high definition blue ray and scene after scene the lighting was terrible. I realize that the action took place after dark. Time after time I could not make out what was going on. I believe that the makers of this film and all of Harry Potter movies would be well served if they gave proper illumination to the scenes. I realize England can be drab and dreary, that wizards wear black and that they teach in Hogwart's dark chambers but consideration should be given to the viewer. I give you as an example, in the case of audio, how many of you have seen a movie in which within a scene horrendous noise is occurring, bombs are going off etc.? Yet, within the scene two lovers speak, perhaps one dying in the arms of the other and there is utter silence in the background as they speak. You are allowed to hear their conversation (literary license?)(perhaps need to tell the story). In the same way, the Potter franchise has often suffered with trying to set the scene with realistic light when what was needed was enough light for the viewer to make out the subject matter. Do others see it my way?",0

Yes there is more dialogue but that was to be expected, it's a long book. It didn't rush things, and added some humor to it now and then. Not entirely sure why the second one gets better ratings. I assume people prefer action over substance. The only real substance in part 2 is Snape's end.. other than that , part 2 is way too short. Totally missed the great elf uprising. Like someone hit panic after the end of this movie. Think Peter Jackson did it better splitting 2 movies into 3 on which it's based on a single tiny book and still made it worth while. (Hobbit) So of the two I prefer this one. Maybe this will change with time but the last movie is so utterly confusing I'd rather read the book again.

208,6.0,"I was quite surprised when I saw the critics had given this first part to the final instalment in the franchise three stars out of five, but I went to see it anyway, and I wish I could say I didn't agree. Basically Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is growing stronger with power, with the help of his dark army of minions, including Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) with father Lucius (Jason Isaacs), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and the many Death Eaters. To take over the wizard world the main threat is the chosen one who could end the whole thing, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is leaving his home with the Dursleys, Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) with the help of the Order of the Phoenix. All the members, including friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the elders at Hogwarts, Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), are willing to protect Harry even if it means death. With the help of the Polyjuice Potion, Harry escapes and those that remain hide at the Weasleys house, where the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) gives Harry, Ron and Hermione the items on the last will and testament of recently killed and still mourned Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). At the wedding of Bill Weasley (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur Delacour (ClÃ©mence PoÃ©sy) there is an attack by Death Eaters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione transport to London, where they find the next Horcrux, the key to ending the evil tirade. This Horcurx, a locket, is stolen at one point by someone in the Ministry of Magic, an associate of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), but with the Polyjuice Potion to disguise they get it back. The three friends then transport themselves to an empty wood to set up camp and hide from the evil forces, and also try to find a way to destroy the locket, which when worn can increase emotions, especially anger. While Voldermort hears of a legendary Elder Wand which he could use to kill Harry, Ron disappears after becoming jealous of Harry with Hermione, thinking that they are falling for each other, which they are not. Without Ron the two of them stay in the woods, they find out from Bathilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas) that the famous sword of Godric Gryffindor may be what can destroy the Horcrux, and they visit the grave of Harry's parents Lily and James, and Ron comes back to save Harry and destroy the locket. Next the trio visit Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans), father of Luna (Evanna Lynch), to learn of the symbol they have seen a few places, he explains it is the Deathly Hallows (the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility). After being captured by the Death Eaters, Hermione is slowly tortured by Bellatrix, with Harry and Ron in the wine cellar who are saved by Dobby (Toby Jones), and there is a small battle before they transport themselves out. In the end, Dobby was injured while transporting Harry, Ron, Hermione and one or two others, they bury him on the beach they landed on, and also Voldermort has found the Elder Wand he can kill Harry with, buried in the coffin of Dumbledore, to be continued... Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Nick Moran as Scabior, Sophie Thompson as Mafalda Hopkirk, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Michael Byrne as Gellert Grindelwald. The three leading young stars are still reliable, maybe particularly Grint, the idea of mainly the three of them on a road trip is I suppose a good getaway from the school, but all the other actors don't get to do much. The special effects are still great, the animated sequence telling the Deathly Hallows story is beautiful, and there are still some good action style moments, but I didn't feel as enthralled as the all four star previous films, but it is an enjoyable enough family fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Make Up/Hair. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Good!",1
209,6.0,"This seventh of the Harry Potter books transferred to the big screen continued the darker and more grown up phase of the development of the story. Unfotunately Harry Potter has been on the go for so long now with such long breaks between film instalments of the book that there is a feeling that it is being deliberately spun out just to keep the revenue stream for as long as possible. Harry Potter was unique and wonderful when it first appeared but I feel it is past its sell by date and remembering how it all started is a dim and distant memory. This episode has nothing to do with Hogworts School, the young (actually not so young now) wizards have left school and are seeking to destroy things called horcruxes which will in turn destroy the power of the dark lord Voldemort. This episode in the long epic story sees the final book being split into two parts, so we'll have to wait yet another year for the concluding part! There were long boring parts in which very little happened - the silent parts in a busy auditorium resulted in hearing all the distracting sounds of sweet papers rustling, people talking and other distractions which normal film sound tracks would have masked. Cannot help but feel the movie makers are deliberately spinning this out and much of this episode could easily have been condensed without losing the plot. Having said that it did contain much of the HP wizardry and the unique JK Rowling formula that has created the Harry Potter phenomenon over the last decade. I think it should really have run its course by now however.",1

I haven't seen a lot of movies but this one is definitely not one of the better ones. I think I'll stick onto the older movies again! They could also made it much shorter.",0
214,6.0,"With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody. Acting was superb like in every other film, probably because of the strong, British cast that has dominated the franchise over the years. The main 3 were again excellent and carry the film on their shoulders. Despite the good performances i found the characters in this film, not particularly enthralling and quite melodramatic at times. Yates' direction in Order of the Phoenix and again in this one is a bit off in my opinion and the tone was all over the place. The film is like a roller coaster, with giddy high points, either in the action or the tone, but there are also many low points with nothing in the middle. I respect and understand the decision to make this movie in the first place, trying to fit both part 1 and 2 in the same movie would be a catastrophe in many ways. That being said, it was very bland and boring at times, the beginning and end were pretty good but the middle of the film was just amateurish. The whole plot line with Ron is aggravating and completely out of character and the very little subplots it had were rushed and under-developed. Another complaint i had was the lack of chronological storytelling, scenes and acts could be easily switched without much change and the film felt disconnected. Overall, i think this film was still good and can see why people like it, but nothing compared to other movies in the series.",1

WTH are all these esoteric details that we were supposed to either know from the book or remember from obscure references in prior films? This is the laziness of a big brand.

I think Hermoine is the best person for the characters because she has a good sense of humor.. I loved Ron and his brothers and how they grew up a lot from the other harry potters.. i like Rons parents a lot and how they are smart and nice to their children.. Dobby is one of the best and awesome elf. I like helen Carter and the person she played she played a good part. Daniel Ratcliff is always the best at harry potter and the way he plays harry potter is always good. I want to see it on DVD to see the special effects to see how they made Voldermort.. I am definitely going to see the second part.. Just to see it and see if its as good as the one i just saw.,1

I haven't been paying the utmost attention to the series, but I have at least seen every film once. If you haven't, don't even bother watching The Deathly Hollows, because no attempt will be made to bring you up to speed with the story so far. Instead you'll spend the entire film wondering why so many famous and much loved British actors keep popping up with just a handful of lines of dialogue between them. It is a curious thing, but ultimately good, that so much time is spent with the film's heroic trio while people like John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs and so, so many more (basically all the British actors) are left to hover around in the background, largely left out of focus.",0

As soon as there is at least a bit of action, it is already over and the viewer can go back to see the tent at different locations ... The 7th book presented so many options to make a great movie out of it, but David Yates failed totally. But I do think it isn't his fault or the fault of the actors (they did a good job, given the bad script) - it is only credited to the fact, that JKR had too much control over everything. I think the second part will be a bit better, but only because of all the action and fighting and I think a lot of people only want to see the glimpse of the future of the main characters.",0

On the other hand, I found the final two books a severe letdown after hundreds of pages of rising anticipation, and the movies, while satisfactory, always seemed to be missing something.

The cinematography and acting is the best by far in this series. Even if this is a build up for part 2 it still has a lot of action in it, so part 2 is gonna be action packed with magic. This is the most mature Harry Potter movie and has a lot of dark tone to it for the better. Overall it's a well directed movie that got my attention almost all the way through, the set pieces, the direction and everything else was just mesmerizing. This is a engaging build up that is worth seeing even if your not really a fan of the Harry Potter books. I suggest watching the previous 6 movies although some maybe painful to sit through for some.

This beginning of the end for the Harry Potter series is a disappointment and apparently without the book the movie is unable to stand alone as a movie and instead becomes a disjointed, disconnected series of movie scenes that initially begins with fusion between a TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) action thriller and a junior version of BRAZIL (1985) and a retro-stylistic, parody version of the cold war, totalitarianism. The rest of the movies eventually almost becomes more like an expensive video game as Harry and company get to survive to the next level in a series of disconnected, random levels. Throughout there are logic gaps, omitted scenes that avoided much needed character, plot development.

Prisoner Of Azkaban took a more stylistic approach and managed to capture a medieval look. The Goblet Of fire (the first of the big ones) in my opinion was utter shambles. The acting was inferior to the others, the style seemed to attempt to copy its predecessor with little success and the comedy was forced, staged and unfunny. Order Of the Pheonix tried to cram a lot of story into a short space of time. Clever ideas and directorial sharpness kept it from falling the way Goblet had.

At one point I wanted to dub this film ""Harry Potter and the World's Longest Camping Trip"". Enough with the teen angst already. Although the impromptu dance sequence between Harry and Hermione is perhaps the film's one touch of humanity - giving the duo a rare moment to be kids, and not muggledom and magic's 'last great hope'. Dobby, too, is in rare form, with his CG denouement played out to perfection. But greed got the better of the studio and led them to stretch a single novel into two films.

David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is a handsome and sometimes harrowing film, and will be completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time. At 146 minutes, it confronts us with a roll call of the many, many characters in the series, and requires a nearly encyclopedic recall of the epic's previous chapters. Though I've seen all the films, there were times when I had no idea what they were talking about. Indeed, there are times when Hermione has to explain to Harry. The film opens with a frightening meeting of the Death Eaters, plotting the destruction of all three young heroes. Presiding is Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), his noseless face disturbingly like a snake's. Harry must be destroyed. That our hero survives after the myriad attacks on his life in the earlier installments does not speak well for Voldemort's minions, but this time they mean business. The late, beloved Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has left obscure clues to their whereabouts, leading to two observations: (1) Beyond a certain level of obscurity, a clue lacks usefulness, and (2) How extraordinary careless of Voldemort to leave missing pieces of his soul lying about. Setting aside actors from earlier films who have passed away (Richard Harris) or are no longer needed (Emma Thompson), let me just cite a list for those who know their actors: Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, John Hurt, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, David Thewlis, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Toby Jones, Simon McBurney, Peter Mullan and Julie Walters.

285,5.0,"The effects are of course, amazing, but really, this part one of part seven is so boring. The joy and youth of all the previous films are gone which is understandable, but the trio of protagonists, Harry, Hermonie and Ron have a road trip of sorts. Largely left to their own devices, I wanted Harry to wave his magical wand around and hurry proceedings up. The darkest and most glum of the films, Lord Voldemort is the personification of evil. He wants to take over the world, not just Hogwarts and the Ministry of magic. The acting is super, all casting is perfect with Helena Bonham Carter a standout. The anticipation of a big cliffhanger will be on the minds of all watching as the audience is aware the finale is not released until July. All I can say is the fireworks have yet to be lit. Take in an extra choc-top this is a sedate film to say the least, however, fans won't mind a bit. There is a clever animated sequence that explains exactly what the deathly hallows are by the way, over all, slick but slow.",1

303,7.0,"It's the beginning of the end. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a major departure from the previous films. This movie is a lot darker, more violent, and thankfully, scarier than most horror films out nowadays. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are finally seventeen. They are now ready to take Dumbledore's mission to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, which hold his soul. As the trio tries to hunt down all of the Horcruxes, they mature and discover just how much they've grown emotionally and romantically. The numerous scares work thanks to the wonderful visuals, musical score, and cinematography. Like the other Harry Potter films, there are few action scenes, but when present, they are well-choreographed and completely engaging. The characters are further developed, revealing new relationships as well as some intriguing secrets. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson deliver their best performances yet. Each one of them gets their moment to shine and prove why they deserve to have great careers after this franchise ends. The director and screenwriter were terrific in making this film more mature then its predecessors, but several flaws place it below the best of the films (the 3rd, 5th, and 6th in my opinion). Too many awkward scenes are present, and the usual touches of humor are placed in the most inappropriate moments of the film. The plot as a whole will feel tricky and confusing at various points throughout the film because far too much is happening at once. Additionally, the pacing feels a little off. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a solid but uneven penultimate entry to the deservedly popular franchise.",1

I liked the part when they infiltrated the Ministry of Magic for the horcrux, when Harry finds the sword of gryffindor in the pond and him seeing the patronus, the story of the Three Brothers and the Hallows, how dark and disturbing Hermione's torture was (which you can't help but cringe at which means that the movie does it's job well), how they handled the death of Dobby, and the overall cinematography. David Yates and all of the cast yet again do great with the story and script that they were given!",1
306,5.0,"So, did they split Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two movies for money? Or did they do it so they didn't leave anything out? Either way this movie was boring, and I mean really boring. The movie follows Harry, Ron and Hermione seeking out the remaining Horcruxes to once and for all defeat Lord Voldemort or, well, it's supposed to. For the most part it's just them sitting around a campfire, no joke, a journey that would have been done in a ten minute montage in the other Harry Potter movies is stretched out into three quarters of the film. The movie also expects you to have read the books, it often takes onto another scene or portion of the film without explaining what's going on whatsoever, it goes from the wedding scene, to the streets of London to them going on a camping trip/journey without much explaining of what's going on. I have also read a lot of reviews saying this movie is the most action packed of them all so far, which is not true at all, in fact, I would argue that this is the least action packed. Really nothing much happens through the whole film, there are three scenes I think where Death Eaters attack, and they're quite fast and are over quickly, and just as the movie starts to pick up, it ends! Which is ridiculous since the movie goes for two and a half hours. This movie was a bore and a let down too, nothing much happens throughout and it's very slow paced and seems to drag on. The movie is only saved by some good performances by the lead cast, and a quite witty nod to the 'Twilight/Harry Potter war'. 5/10, 2/5",0

In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels.

319,10.0,"Three years ago, the world held its collective breath as it flipped through the pages of the the final installment of JK Rowling's epic 7-part series, seeking the satiation for a curiosity that had all but consumed them absolutely for years-who would live? who would die? and what would become of the survivors? Thousands of theories and counter-theories later, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows revealed the answers at long last (some of which had already been predicted); but it wasn't just the resolution of sub-plots and character arcs and the solving of long-standing magical mysteries that gripped the reader, but above all the sheer epic scale and scope of this saga within a saga that spanned virtually the entirety of the fantastic realm spawned by Rowling. Needless to say, while the novel positively GLOWED with cinematic potential, adapting an epic such as this does present unprecedented challenges...even more so when one takes into account the Harry Potter film series predilection for liberally eliminating significant plot elements from the novels in hopes of condensing the stories for accommodation in a 2-3 hour time span. Now, the same clearly couldn't be done with the Deathly Hallows-the minutest elements were of paramount importance to the overall plot and couldn't be safely done away with without running the risk of completely butchering Rowling's story. To this end, the film-makers wisely decided to split the book into two films...And after a long wait Part I is finally here and it certainly surpasses expectations (then again, it is pretty much EXPECTED that an HP film WILL 'surpass expectations'...) The very first aspect of this film that strikes you is that it sends a message. A very strong message that the wizarding world has changed-for the worse. The trademark WB logo we see at the start of the film is shown to be rusting...in stark contrast to the glowing WB of old; much like the circumstances of the characters have taken a turn for the worst. Death Eaters are perpetually swirling about in the skies, waiting to attack members of the Order of the Pheonix when the slightest opportunity presents itself...Voldemort has taken control of the Ministry, using its official authority and power to hunt down dissidents to his fascist regime of pure-blood supremacy...and Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced out of the sanctuary of their homes, on the run in the wilderness, with barely a clue as to how they are to accomplish the crucial task their deceased mentor Albus Dumbledore left them-finding and destroying the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) that anchor the Dark Lord to life.",0

Characters and actions related to the next part where eliminated, creating a hole in relationships and even our feelings from some characters (i.e. Sirius Black).

326,8.0,"Likes: The 3 main actors did some of their best work, they have really grown over the years and fleshed out these characters to an impressive degree. They provide the most emotional scenes of the HP films. The direction is great, providing the most realistic of the films and a great layer of dread and suspense over everything. The few moments of comic relief are effectively subtle, I enjoyed the lack of silliness and slapstick gags. The beginning with Hermoine making her parents forget her was well done and powerful. The ""heist"" section was fun and interesting. The Voldemort dinner was effectively chilling. Great stuff all around in the scene where they finally destroy the horcrux. Hot evil Hermoine is hot. The action chase in the opening was great. I liked the multiple Harry's and the humor that provided, and the visuals were cool during the flight on the motorcycle. Really awesome camera work and cinematography, providing visuals that furthered the sense of them being all alone in their quest. By not having to rush things the audience gets a much better feel for the frustrating setting for our heroes. In the brief time he is on screen, Alan Rickman once again makes Snape one of the most engaging characters in the series. This film is up their with the best produced entries, quite a feat considering it goes up against the magnificent Prisoner of Azkaban. While I wouldn't say it's the best technically made film, it's probably second best. I've enjoyed seeing the series get darker and more atmospheric as it goes. For the first time there is actual realistic danger towards the characters, which adds a lot.

340,1.0,"This movie attempts to show the 7th installment of the Harry Potter series in a solemn and depressing view. I watched the movie yesterday with friends, feeling that the 6th movie was reasonably good in telling the story faithfully in mood and conversation. The 7th movie part 1 leaned too heavily on the ""dark and depressed theme"". It fails to capture many of the other moods in the first half of the book--any attempts at humour are quite half hearted and don't bring out the flavour of interaction between the characters in the book(happiness and some liveliness even when Ron returned--all very sluggish and lifeless and even the anger from Hermione was half- hearted). There are also unnecessary scenes--most prominent is the dancing between Harry and Hermione--it contributed little to the plot. Furthermore the interaction between the characters is stiff(supposedly ""depressed"" but failed to integrate with character personality). In addition, some scenes are dragged out and conversation is sparse and when there is conversation it is brief and hurried. I suspect, to give the illusion that the story is progressing at a normal pace, character interaction appears slow but changing between scenes is rapid and each scene is short. The 3 main characters have also lost their personalities--although there are some brief attempts at regaining them. I am also appalled at the usage of Dobby to attempt ""comic relief"" but is totally out of character with the Dobby in the book. I also felt the movie portrayal of Dobby, particularly the lines, to be--no other word for it--cheesy. However, there are some good parts--portrayal of Ron's struggle with the locket is well done, I think and so is the ministry heist. However, the magic is poorly done and Hermione is often sporting a different set of incredibly fashionable wear every scene. The movie gives the feeling of having many shots taken but edited and cut, then strung together by blending blackouts. I really wanted to enjoy the movie but am very let down.",0

Towards the end it got more interesting when someone you don't expect manages to save the guys which I liked.

Each scene was carefully crafted -Loved how they did the part about the Beetle Bard's Tale of the Three Brothers.. They could have just glossed over this back story like how they completely massacred Half Blood Prince - but they didn't. Splitting them up into 2 movies is THE ONLY WAY to capture the glory and intricacy of the book! I found the HALF BLOOD PRINCE to be SUCH a disappointment that I almost lost complete HOPE of every watching a good movie of JK's AMAZING HARRY POTTER series. Now, I just can't wait to watch the final movie. HATS OFF to David Yates. Well done... You've made a HARRY POTTER FAN so proud!",1
345,9.0,This is a very good film. The three main characters try to find the horcruxes to beat Voldemort. It has a good story but a slow screenplay in parts which keeps you bored a little in some moments. Other than that it is a must watch is you love Harry Potter.,1

347,7.0,"The focus is on Harry, Hermoine and Ron, on their quest, with just a few scenes involving any others, and Valdemort is back, but still on the peripheral. And the three carrying around that horcrux as it sucks the life from them and makes them turn on each other is reminiscent of the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, and not the most entertaining time I've had watching a Harry Potter movie. Things are downright dour! This is a kid's film?<br /><br />Still, it's not totally bad. The scenes with Valdemort show him to be a great villain, as he feeds one of the teachers to his snake, and the beginning has a thrilling sequence with a bunch of Harry Potter look-alikes, and the end, where Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lastrange tortures Hermoine and the elf Dobby shows up to save them all, but they pay a price, were also very good.

348,9.0,"Part 1 of the final chapter in the Harry Potter series, ""The Deathly Hallows"" comes back with a more darker look, and new plot-twisting elements involving the search of the remaining horcruxes. Now, this happens to be another personal favorite from the Harry Potter series. Mainly because of its new two-part plot, the new stunning effects, and gives us flashbacks of the previous films by bringing back Dobby the House Elf, Dolores Umbridge, the Dementors, the Golden Snitch and many other memorable Harry Potter icons. Also, the movie had the most drama and intensity than the others had so far. This movie makes you waiting on what will happen next, and takes us back with some memorabilia, and it will give us reminders of the previous films, so we never lose sight with this spectacular series, and I hope all of this continues later in Part 2. So there's only one more movie, and there are more horcruxes to find, and a huge battle will be taken place where it all began. Will you see the final Harry Potter? I'll take that as a ""hell, yeah!"". Well, that's what Harry Potter is all about! Drama, suspense, and let's not forget the magic.

The sound mixing and sound design are incredible again. If there's one thing the Harry Potter series has done really well consistently, it's the sound mixing and design.<br /><br />4.

However, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 relapses because it isn't fundamentally driven by emotions. Despite its bleak narrative, it's an adventure with tonally inconsistent solutions. That rocky blending of lightheartedness with maturity is a key downgrade. Plus, Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is an incomplete episode because it lacks an ending. No core themes or issues are resolved. Some will forgive that since it's a series, but all films should have individualized conclusions (early Potterverse is a great example).",1

I offered my opinion that the author, J.K.

So far I have only enjoyed ""The prisoner of Azkhaban"" and bits a pieces of others, but this one is the first I like a lot from start to finish. It is much more mature than previous ones, just like the trio of heroes is getting more mature. There is no cheesy dialog or childish jokes or sub-plots, the violent bits are done well and the use of music is excellent - sparse, economic but very efficient. Yates is not afraid to have several slow moments without any music, and I liked it. The short story about 3 brothers is a surprising gem of animation in itself. And despite being grim and sad, the film contains quite a lot of delicate humor. The acting is good, especially from Helena Bonham-Carter, the girl playing Hermione and that old silent lady historian, who has a short, mute but very effective appearance.",1

There isn't really anything that inappropriate in this movie, it is only PG-13 because of violence (which isn't even that bad) so you could bring your children if you wished 5. The action scenes are well done. Although sometimes they can be difficult to follow, they still include the suspense you want them to in order to elevate what happens next. And if you cant follow them...it's a book and movie that is largely based on action, why would you be watching it then? 6. Even if you're not the most die-hard Harry Potter fan, you should be able to follow along quite well without even having read the books. (Although I have read all of them, that part is coming from my numerous friends who also saw it) 7. It is difficult to make a movie based off of a book, because people always complain that people who haven't read the book can't follow along, or that people who have see that they've left out details, but with the plot of J.K Rowling combined with the directing of Yates, it works out nicely.",1

The film is really emotional this time around a lot of characters die. For example Dolby the house elf dies and it's really sad to see him die the way he does I almost had tears in my eyes. And if you do not like snakes then do not see this there are two major scenes that involve a snake the first one is at the start of the film and this scene is rather creepy and disturbing. The second scene has a jump scene so if your scared of snakes then don't go. The movie has a little bit of blood in it.

405,8.0,"I almost forgot that I was watching one of the Harry Potter's movies. I feel like in a different universe compare to its predecessors. Thiz last grand epic is still directed by David Yates who was unknown Director before his involvement in the 5th film ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in 2007. Actually, Yates has ever tried to implement thiz kind of atmosphere into the 6th film ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) which is dark and gloomy with more realistic approach. But back then, it wasn't supported by attractive storyline. Thiz is the finale of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world when everything is about to end. The villain Voldermort (upssÂ… I mean You-Know-Who) gets stronger than ever. Harry Potter and his two loyal friends Ron and Hermione have to find hidden Horcruxes in order to destroy the dark lord himself. The movie starts with the doom element and dark impression everywhere, and then enters into Special Effects extravaganza, just like the previous prequels. The story as we know it before, it is centered on Harry, Ron and Hermione. Thiz chapter explores the unrevealed relationship further and for the result is something very different. I think I can see what happens here. Yates tries to lock them up alone in the same room, and then see what could possibly happen. For the first time in thiz franchise, Yates has shown us that Harry Potter's movies aren't just always about Special Effects exhibition, but also about the depth of its characters. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has done everything he can, to show more mature emotions. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) improves his acting better than ever. Emma Watson (Hermione) has grown up to be a beautiful and gorgeous girl. She obviously has the most promising career in the future. The heavy caliber Supporting Cast members are also in solid performances such as Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and even Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Yates himself explores every possible technique that he could find, like flash back sequences, racking focus, bird's eye angle, hand-shake camera and even graphic animation when he reels of ""The Tale of Three Brothers"". The animation is artistic, enjoyable and mind-blowing. I ever hoped that Guillermo Del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth"" {2008} and ""Hell Boy"" {2007}) would be the Director of thiz last phenomenal epic. With his resume it will be perfect! But that never happened. Each of us has been growing up with thiz franchise. The franchise itself certainly manifests being more than just the movies, but it's also becoming the part of our culture in thiz generation. It is ""Wingardium Leviosa"" to the highest level, ""Expelliarmus"" all the bad factors, and it surely won't be ""Obliviate"" for a long time, it will be ""Lumos"" brightly until the end. Can't wait to see that flat-nosed monster being defeated at the end! ",1
406,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, directed by David Yates, was a highly anticipated film, with some great moments, but David Yates seemed to have missed on the potential this film had, making it feel somewhat underwhelming. The way the film was structured was pretty messy, because they felt the need to split this into two films. Most events felt underdeveloped and unfinished, having no real pay off, because they needed to fit so much into this film, for Part 2 to work the way they wanted it to. Part 1 can only stand on it's own, due to the tie ins from the previous films, because it took all of the set up hits, to create just an action-packed finale. When Yates went off the source material, that's where the film takes it's dips. The stuff he throws in, just feels like unnecessary filler, because it has no real meaning to what's going on. Other than that, David Yates managed to stay fairly true to the source material, creating a nice mystery, with great stakes, and a really intriguing adventure. The pacing of the film as fine at first, then became more of a slowburn film, and it threw off the excitement this film had to offer. The tone Yates set was probably one of the darkest, and unsettling yet, almost having a slight horror vibe.",1

410,7.0,"This is the first Harry Potter movie which refers to a part of a book and not the whole. This may have to do with the fact that the last book of the series is quite long or with reasons of profit or possibly both. It is a good movie in general with aspects of fairy-tale, modern angst, Kafkaesque interiors and Orwellian situations, as well as poignant scenes of family relationships or even subdued and latent eroticism.",1
411,7.0,"This is my least favourite one. As much as I love Part 2, I really don't think this should have been split into two films. Just make a 3 hour epic the finale you COWARDS. No but seriously, the pacing, particularly in the second half, is just too slow for me to really get into it. I still like the visuals and the story overall, and I would say that the performances of the lead three are probably the best that they've ever been. They've truly come into their own as actors, and it's great to see that. I do wish Ginny got more screentime aswell, but that's been an issue since the 5th film so that doesn't bother me anymore. I still really like where they went with Draco, and the opening action sequence is really enjoyable, and sets the film up really well. So whilst I don't love this as much as some of the others, I still appreciate a lot of elements within it, and at the end of the day I do enjoy it.",1
412,,"I saw Harry Potter last night, and I have to say that I was extremely impressed. Splitting the movie into two parts was the best decision that could have been made for the seventh book. They fit in so many important parts and they were able to be extremely detailed in the story line. At first I was skeptical because the first half of the book was a good read, but sounded very difficult to portray on screen. I mean, who wants to watch them wander around lost with no idea of where they are going for the whole movie? Somehow Yates pulled it off. I was glued to the screen for the whole 2 hrs and 20 minutes of the film. I thought the acting was superb, the sets were AMAZING (Malfoy's Manor being a highlight in my mind), and the music did a great job in adding to the emotions of the characters. (The ending with Dobby comes to mind). This is definitely the best piece of work they could have done, as far as staying true to the book.",1
413,7.0,This must go down as contender for longest film title although I think Borat may claim that crown. So we are nearly at a close! 7 books and 7 films later with one left and finally we can put Harry Potter to bed for a good nights sleep. He needs it.,1
414,6.0,"While the opening is as thrilling as it is emotional, the story grinds to a halt after Harry, Ron, and Hermione are separated from their friends and family. The inclusion of several drawn out subplots make it unclear whether this final chapter needed to be split into two parts at all.",1
415,10.0,"First i wanna say that this is not the best Harry Potter and that the only reason i gave it ten is because it's a Harry Potter movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a whole lot of fun and also the most faithful adaptation so far. Unfortunately, that's the problem right there. I'm not sure it was such a good idea to make two movies out of it. They found a part in the book that could be suitable as an ending and they decided to make two movies instead of one. That way they make more money and that way they stay more faithful to the material. However, that part they found good as an ending didn't work well as one. I would say that the only person to blame for this is David Yates. Even though i usually like him as a HP director and i appreciate and am very found of that dark tone that he brought to the series, with this one he made a big mistake. The final 'fight' scene was way too short and way too simple to be a 'final fight' scene. The entire movie would have been a lot better if it was made a bit differently. All needed to be done was to make it a bit slower, and by doing so longer, and a bit more with an attitude, so to say. The entire movie, because of it, really left a hollow impression. Either you read the books or not, you can just tell that it's not finished-that there's something missing.",0
416,9.0,"This film is very underrated in my opinion. Many people online see this movie as the set-up for part two, but it is also so much more than that. I just don't think this movie should be remembered as ""the time they just wanted more money,"" because in my opinion this movie is fantastic from start to finish. We literally start off with one of the best action scenes in this entire series, and end it with one of the saddest deaths. Overall, this movie is designed to hype everyone up for part two, but also succeeds as a great movie by itself.",1

419,1.0,I had to make this review because its really frustrating of how drawn out Harry Potter is. If anyone saw Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince we know that movie was way too long and they just cut out the most crucial parts of a story. Now if they wanted to do that then why split two parts for the last movie when you could of left it to just one or add in some parts you missed out from the Half-Blood Prince to clarify things. It's all about milking money from the franchise.,0
420,5.0,"Here's what's wrong: a novel sells billions of copies, and then the director thinks people want to see their interpretation (which means they sacrifice important plot points for their own tepid inventions). How do you exist with a head so big? Anyway, here's the plot, Harry Potter doesn't realize it, but Darth Voldemort is his father. And! If Harry can only take the apparently alternate-lifestyle Sam with him to the top of the volcanic mountain and throw in the ring, then the annoying emo chick with the pale face and the vampire fetish will die, which will bring about peace in The Middle East and erase all memories of the Telletubies. But, before they do that they must spend 2/3rds of the movie camping in England, living off of stolen canned boiled food (which is a major contributing factor in the grave dental challenges to the people of that island).

424,9.0,"this movie is defidently one of the best potter movies of the series. it was a very well done potter with all that you need in a movie. it had dramatic scenes that were very well done by the three kids. now there grown however in those scenes they really showed that they can act and can act very well. it also was a very funny movie. it had funny moments however some did not quite fit in the movie. the best part of the film was doby came back for this one but would suffer a terrible fait at the end of the movie. also worm tail was in and Lucius malfoy came back but only for two scenes. speaking of which Severus snape. one of the greatest characters in the franchise only got one scene in the whole film. he should of got more. like you heard he became headmaster of hogwarts but they didn't show it. instead they mentioned it on a radio harry Hermione and Ron had on there journey. they should of showed it. also i didn't like that almost all the scenes were just with harry Hermione and Ron. maybe 45 minutes out of the two and a half hour film had other people with harry Hermione and Ron. and some of the scenes with just Ron harry and Hermione dragged on and got boring. they could of filled that with a lot more things. like snape becoming headmaster and the audience finding out about what is going on at hogwarts. who's there, who isn't. other than that a very entertaining film that makes your emotions go crazy. see it.",1

So let's start with the plot. I mean the screenplay because we all know that the book is as awesome as hell. The screenplay is ... well not so good. I mean it's not bad either but it could of been so much better. They deleted scenes which would take couple of minutes but would add so much. And there's nothing bad about a long movie(yeah we all remember LOTR don't we?). So yeah that's that also they for some unknown reason change some lines. Like when Ron gets all angry and is about to go he says ""I sow you to the other night"" wheres in the book he said ""I got it you choose him"". I mean JK knew what she was doing and her lines would always be better than those of the dude who rote screenplay. OK, now that we're over with that - effects, yes of cause special. I've got to admit - there pretty cool. Of cause it's no Dark Knight nor Inception though it's understandable since Nolan wasn't around (dan it). Acting. It was pretty good. Rupert Green rules as always. Atmosphere is not as good as in the book but whatever. So all in all it's a good adaptation and you've got to cheek it out. You know you would anyway it's a bloody HP we're talking about.",0
426,8.0,"A lot of people have claimed that this movie was boring and slow. In my opinion it's a masterpiece.

427,9.0,"The six previous Harry Potter films were good in their own right, however part one of the seventh installment is director David Yates's masterpiece (since he took over the series with The Order of The Phoenix in 2007). Yates targets a more adult and grown up audience in this film, however, it is a very familiar audience and gives the original fans of the series a more contemporary film that has developed with its fans themselves. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson's acting talents have matured after being together for so many films creating flawless chemistry. They help create an entirely different dark and evil atmosphere. The film delves deep into the realms of while inserting the comedic antics along to lift the audience up along the way. Therefore, leave the kids at home and prepare for the series' best chance for an an heard of best picture nomination. Yates sets the tone of the film right away with the words of Bill Nighy's character Rufus Scrimgeour, ""These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.""

432,9.0,The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first Harry Potter movie that is not set in Hogwarts as Harry Potter is on a quest to find and destroy all the Horcruxes. This does not dissipate the excitement and in fact it has improved the story as the main characters are not bound by anything.,0
433,6.0,"The first five ""Harry Potter"" movies all have one significant thing in common. Regardless of the plot, the ending is conclusive. Obviously, it's clear the big picture is not yet complete, but this one, this particular installment in the huge franchise is nicely ""wrapped up"". Discoveries may have been made, tragedies may have shaken our heroes' world, but for now, it is over, and they're all happy and at peace. As are we, the viewers. Then ""The Half-Blood Prince"" arrived and something was different. The ending was different. This time, regardless of how big the events depicted in the movie were, the ending was a strong way to make you immediately want more.

So after reading all the books, and watching all the movies up until this point, i must say.....it's just okay. I don't hate them, but i don't love them. To me, they just fall right in the middle. To this day, i will never understand those damn ""Twlight"" movies, but i can understand how someone will become engrossed by these fantasy tales.

438,6.0,"Steve Kloves seems to always drag his Harry Potter screenplays to as far as he can, getting worse and worse towards the end of the saga. This movie makes few of the basic mistakes of screen writing, over-explaining stuff that don't need explaining and vice versa. It was all alright for the 1 hour mark of the movie, but then the slow dragging started. Poorly written lines, scenes that didn't quite make sense unless you've already read the book, some conflicts that in the end didn't matter, at all. Next time, show, don't tell.",0
439,9.0,"It is a shame that Warner Bros decided to split the franchise into 2 parts, but that was however a very smart move. Even though the movies were made to satisfy the fans, but its main reason was to make more money with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. We'd watched all three of them grow for a decade, now to think that they're all adults and the franchise is going to be over soon, it is an odd feeling to say the least. The wizard world is corrupting because Lord Voldemort is back with his powers. Even the Ministry of Magic has to hide. The movie takes us on a journey with the three friends rather than giving us a battle between Harry and Voldemort. This is the number one reason fans are complaining about: there wasn't enough action and adventure. But in my opinion, the movie is just building tension for the next one. Even though the film doesn't give much on action, the acting is perfectly where we want it. The three friends give it their all but standing out is Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and his evil companion Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter). The make-up part in the franchise is always mesmerizing to see. These artists must've worked really hard to have Voldemort's face looked like that! Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 does not disappoints at all, not with its fine acting and brilliant make-up.",1

It's just so hard to take it seriously, because you don't feel any danger and for that don't really care about the characters either. Deathly Hallows should be the grand finale of Harry Potter saga, but manages mostly to bore you with its endless running sequences that seem to go nowhere. Every now and then Harry and co stop on their tracks and speculate things, just because the plot requires so.

This entry takes maturity to its next level to a point where the whimsical magic of previous films have now completely evaporated evolving deeper and deeper into non lit places (sorry, just trying to avoid using the much overused ""darkest episode yet"") But I'll be honest, as much as I enjoyed this film, I suspect this will be my least repeated viewing film in the series. I have watched all the previous films more than twice (and for the record I love every single film in the series including the much criticised first 2). But this one is much more slowly paced, which is not my complaint, in fact I loved the pacing, its the fact that it wraps up hardly any story thread in such a slow manner, that it its re-watchable factor is very low. Yes it is Part 1 of 2 but still, with any chronicle series, I expect at least 1 or 2 sub plots to be resolved. Here, I cannot think of any sub story strand being resolved. But I will watch it again, just not as many times as the others which offer a more all round complete package of entertainment and complete narrative.",1

But recently, I gave it an honest effort, and boy, was I surprised. As a summer blockbuster, it falls flat on its face.

This is a magical world with limitless potential (to a degree) and there isn't a whole lot of creativity at all. It's basically as if they're all firing little magical crackers that knock people out. The worst offender was that chase scene through the forest, which was almost made me sick with its horrific camera shaking and random crackers being launch at trees.

459,7.0,The end is near and now the power of Voldemort can clearly be traced out. This installments majorly focuses on the climax which is near. Henceforth the sole attention is paid to the action sequences. What I believe is that the movie is stretched without any reason just to produce another installment. Nothing much important happens in this part and the major part is left for the last installment. All the questions which were aroused in Half Blood Prince are majorly left unanswered. This is a let down again and the producers now are greedy for another one clearly. The romantic relationships are more focused without any importance just to cover up the running time.

460,9.0,"It's sort of unfair to have to do a review to the Part 1 of a movie since there were a lot of plot threads left hanging (as intended) but for the most part, it stands on its own as a fairly decent film. It's probably one of the most faithful in terms of adaptation to the novel (with a few extra scenes added in for emotional and dramatic effect), which has the dual effect of being very good for the fans but not necessarily the most coherent for people who haven't read the books.

I love how Harry, Ron, and Hermione has now grown and they are fully youth. Voldemort is my favorite character because his acting is so good. This harry potter was different. It wasn't like the other harry potters where they always go on the train and go to hogwarts. I personally thought this was a bit similar to lord of the rings. Where in lord of the rings they have to return the ring back to the Mount Doom, this is similar. In this, they have to find the Horcruxes.

The painting of Phineas Nigellus that they took from Grimauld Place was not in the movie and this is how Snape found out were the trio were to pass the sword of Gryffindor on to them which means that they will probably make up another reason for how he found them in part 2 2.

Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.",1

483,7.0,"""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" follows our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as they set out to find the seven objects, known as Horcruxes in the film, that will evidently destroy the evil Voldermort. It is a extremely difficult task since not only are they hidden in unknown places, but also the knowledge on how to destroy them is unknown too. There is also one more person who faces an extremely difficult task too, director David Yates. Can he possibly make a Potter movie that not only takes place out of the familiar Hogwarts and is much more dramatic still lovable to J.K. Rowling's fans? David Yates has surpassed Christopher Columbus in terms of handling the reigns with the popular series. Columbus up until now was the only one who directed more than one Potter film. The third film (Azakaban) was directed by Alfanso Cauron and the fourth (Goblet) was directed by Mike Newell. Yates, then came in and handled the fifth (Order), sixth (Half-Blood Prince), and finally this film, that has been split into two parts. The reasoning being because nothing is being cut out of the this time around. Fans rejoiced when they found out they would be getting a five hour conclusion to their beloved series. Yates has said to have brought out the maturity in the series that it needed. Under his eye, the films definitely have more of an adult feel to them. Signs of the change were present the second ""Order of Phoenix"" started with Potter's evil cousin, Dudley, finally got what was coming to him. Even before Dudley came face to face with one of the most feared inhabitants of the wizarding world, you could sense something terrible was bound to happen. Yates perfectly nailed the sense of dreariness through the flushed out colors and perfectly placed camera angles. Then in ""The Half Blood Prince"" he created a very sympathetic character out of Horace Slughorn, with the help of Jim Broadbeant. Here, he keeps the same gift for creating dread and despair. One of the first scenes in the film, a poor ex-teacher at Hogwarts, hangs in the air while Voldermort's crew discusses their next move. We know, as does she, it is just a matter of time before she bites the dust. It is detail like this that make these films establish the dark tone that Yates is going for.",1

But however, the reason I gave this a 8 is because the film was perfect, awesome, fabulous, exciting and marvellous.The first part of the everlasting series marks the point to a final war and opened up the penultimate chapter to a whole new level.

While this is not all that appreciated by fans of the books and critics, this is probably what has kept the Potter film series as enduring as it has, appealing more to mass audiences than hardcore viewers. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" finally breaks this trend and boldly steps away from the action and humor (but don't worry, there's enough to keep the pace up) to give us a much-needed character study of the main trio that has been, mostly, missing since the third film.",1

It just made me wonder, ""Where are they going to go now?!"". But then I remembered that it wasn't the end. I had to give it a 10/10. I didn't expect much of the movie. It is kind of like the movie Inception. It keeps you wondering. Every I watch it, my brain keeps on spinning with questions. The movie was completely amazing! I am SO going to see Deathly Hallows Part 2. The questions that run through my head are something like: are they just going to stay there? What is Voldemort going to do with his new wand?

503,6.0,"Part 1 of one book a terrible trend. I look for things to like about the movie, and there is plenty of good.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is great, probably on of the better segments in the series. The opening scene, establishes the bad guys even further, and is almost funny with their dark humor.<br /><br />From then on we reach our main characters and follow them the whole time, which gives us the opportunity to dive more into our main characters in isolation with each other. The scene with multiple Harrys is very fun and leads into a good action peace, with chaos in the air, and it has consequences with Mad Eye Moody's death, which affects Harry later when he tries to leave. Harry, Ron, and Hermione soon are thrown into an adventure together to hunt down and destroy the horcruxes. The mystery is well paced until they are thrown into the woods.<br /><br />When they reach the woods the plot slows down. In the second half of the movie they learn of the Deathly Hallows and figure out how to destroy one horcruxe and get no clues to more.<br /><br />The movie's climax is escaping from the Malfoy Mannor and Doby's death. Which if this were one movie it would be anti-climactick but it is two parts and it would be better to enjoy them as one then as two.<br /><br />The Harry Potter movie's get progressively dark and this one is. The characters are more depressed, the world seems like it is crumbling, multiple characters died. The scenery in this movie is great, all the locations the heroes reach on their endless trek are beautiful. The movie is amazingly shot. The movie has humor sprinkled in a solid amount.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are amazing their performances have obviously improved with their age. The 6th movie and this one do a really great job of building up Ron and Hermione's romance, I don't know how it takes them 8 movies to get together.<br /><br />Voldemort has been slowly built up over the course of all the movies and with this movie I was time for him to take his final form, character wise.<br /><br />Doby and Luna have always annoyed me, but I can look past it. It is tragic that Doby dies saving Harry, but he was written out of a few movies and mad it less impactful.<br /><br />A second viewing of these movies as given me a deeper understanding of the plot and I have come to see the build up to and give context to the story.<br /><br />I like this movie it is Ok. It has a strong first half and a weak second half, and fits well as a prelude to the exciting final chapter.",1
504,8.0,"While watching movie, in few places I had doubts about this movie. Not that movie ain't great, but that many scenes that were actually important to movie story were cuted out and few that actually don't matter nothing were included. Take example of Kreacher's story, and the scene when Harry and Herimiona dance in the tent (actualy, that scene is never written in book). So, what's more important ?! To see their knowledge of dancing, or to understand Kreacher's life (actualy, when Kreacher crush down on the ground of being overwhelmed with happiness was one of most emotional scenes in the book). That's one minus. Then, the story about entering the Ministry was, softly said, terrible. I mean, in one moment they realize that they should go to Ministry, and in then they're there ... However, when we throw away these few misleads in movie, we get one great movie that warms us for epic finale that will cast out the mightiness of the Harry Potter to maximum. Still, I'm a bit afraid of the things they might throw away in second part. ",1

The fact that the story is completely focused on the mythical trio is something that personally made me even more fond of the protagonists.

My biggest concern with this, prior to the screening was the idea of David Yates directing. I personally find him rather boring, BUT with Deathly Hallows he actually hits the nail on the head. There's some really awkward moments, but overall it's more than a solid entry to the series. The reason I think Yates has made a success of this is because it's so different. It's a road movie.

Half blood prince was good too but I dint find it very good either. I wasn't really happy that Yates is going to direct the last two but he has taken me by surprise. Rupert Grint portrayed the role to the tee. So did Daniel and Emma. Daniel was absolutely great in some scenes and Emma looked drop dead gorgeous. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was better in this movie than the previous installments and Dobby, u brought tears to me eyes. It had a lot of action and Nagini's scenes deserve a special mention for creeping me out ;) Starting with Hermione perform Obliviate, the seven Potters chase sequence(very funny then action packed), the wedding with the news ""They are coming""(Goose bump giving), the ministry sequence with Umbridge(Hilarious + pulse raisin), the camping sequences (scenic), the horcrux destruction(woooooh!), the tale of the three brothers (nicely portrayed by animation), the Malfoy Manor(thrilling), Dobby's death(tearful) and finally the end which makes u hungry for more. Go grab a ticket!!! The fans of the movies as well as the books are going to love the movie completely :)",1
516,8.0,"If you enjoy the other Harry Potter filmsÂ…even if you just like the books of Harry PotterÂ…you'll love this movie! This was part 1 of a two part series of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" I honestly expected this movie to be action packed with all wands blazing with war...mainly because until now...I didn't know what the books were about, lol. Now that I know what the books are about, it's easy to see why the first movie was not as action packed as I originally thought. This movie was demonstrating that, even through the most difficult times...true friends will always be there. Interestingly enough...there were a few awkward scenes in the movie with the character Hermione and Harry. I'm not going to go into detail, because it may ruin the movie for you...but I'll just say that it seems like they are trying to form a love triangle with Ron, Harry, and Hermione. I could be wrong...but the movies seem to be headed that direction. Overall...it was pretty amazing! Definitely something you do NOT want to miss while it's in theaters!

517,,"I was disappointed by this movie on first viewing, I'm not sure why. One of those little things bothered me that I couldn't quite put my finger on. However on second viewing I absolutely loved it. I loved how: it started off with Hermione instead of Harry for once, your eyes were drawn more to Rupert Grint than anyone else (or at least mine were, his brooding was quite eye-catching), Ron and Hermione's relationship is gradually building itself up, the 3 brothers story was animated, Harry danced with Hermione (not in the book as far as I remember but a brilliant touch all the same), Dobby's shoes were awesome and it ends with a huge cliffhanger. The only problem with it was it missed out the ghoul in the attic that Ron said was his replacement in the book whilst he was off with Harry and Hermione (when it shows him looking grumpy and staring into the distance at the start after Hermione's opening it could've shown him sorting out the ghoul or at least mentioned it so it seemed like he was contributing the group effort. Or something!) and it also missed out a crucial line from the book which would've been very useful at the time after he destroyed the locket. Harry said: ""She's always been like a sister to me, I thought you knew."" or something along those lines.",1

520,7.0,"The problem of the Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is evident from the title: Part 1. There is no climax in the movie. The story is left inconclusive as it should be since it will be concluded in Part 2. I could understand if Part 2 will be released within 4 to 6 weeks so that we can watch them back to back. Now we will probably forget about the despair that the trio experienced and Part 2 will be baseless. The main problem of the all HP movies were the unclarity of the reason of the evil ones. I did not read any of the books but just watching the films I never got the mega plan of Valdermort. Why he was evil, why he was killing all these people? And more importantly why all these people are following him. Now we have a better idea. Valdermort is the Adolf Hitler of the wizards. But still, Hitler and Nazis had a socio-economic motive. We do not understand why these bad guys do not like the others. However, I must add this is a very beautiful movie. The scenes, the emotions and the character development is very successful. It feels more like a European art movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. This is a general trend. The story was also secondary in Avatar. You must watch the movie if you are familiar with the series but do not expect too much from the story. I really hope that the DVD will be available before Part 2 release so that we can refresh our mind before watching it. Finally, I believe the scene that Harry and Hermoine was making out was unnecessary and too graphic. This is still a children movie and it was too much for 7 year-old.",1

525,9.0,This movie has some faults but maturation of the subject matter and its treatment make this better than many other sequel films. It displays a great transition from mid to late teen subject matter and perspective to one of a person that has fully left childhood behind.,1

528,2.0,"This was very unsatisfying to watch. Very depressing. Resorting to crude sexuality rather than the mysterious forces of life, magic, which was prevalent in the sorcerer's stone. The true pandemic of our time is the depression and lack of depth, which is in this movie.",1

530,2.0,"If I do have a criticism here, I do agree that the pacing is rather slow. I think it started and ended brilliantly, it was the middle where it dragged with a lot of admiring the scenery. As beautiful as it was, it didn't admit much to the story.",0
531,9.0,"Yates, in his wisdom has handled the transition from Hogwarts to the real world masterfully. The magical threesome, Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown up before our eyes and in DH their sense of isolation, confusion, triumphs and defeats feel as though we are not outsiders watching but a participant in their grief. In DH there is little to celebrate, even less to laugh at- but the sense that life is not all smiles and easy most of the time is real and that is what makes DH magical. ",1
532,8.0,"Harry Potter, a.k.a. the boy who lived. We have seen him grow as in the previous 6 movies and here in the deathly hallows, the end is coming. Part 1 is a really good. So far one of the best of the series, however this has 2 problems. First there is not enough magic as in the other films which lose the wizard touch to the film and two, when Belatrix marks Hermione, it reminded me of the Holocaust, when they marked the Jewish prisoners. I have to say that, that scene should have not been portrayed because it might be offensive to people. However the movie is so well explained you could understand it. Overall the movie is really great, and the cliffhanger in the end leaves me wanting for more. Luckily part 2 comes out soon.",1
533,10.0,"I was thoroughly excited at a new film despite the fact that the last 3 instalments of the series were, at best, disappointments. Potter fans want Potter films of the book. The apparent Hollywood imperative of making movies somewhat different from the books has pervaded the last attempts at adaptation of J.K. Rowlings masterpieces. The last one was mostly a love story between Ron and Hermione, which was, at best, a sideline of the books. Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that most books, if truly transferred to film, would likely result in exceedingly long movies, movies such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" managed it quite nicely. It is clear that there are going to be things left out. But one would imagine that writers and directors would be somewhat more careful in the surgery than they had been with ""Goblet of Fire"", ""Half-Blood Prince"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"". I walked into the theatre with anticipation. I walked out satisfied. The reality is that they did have to cut things out. There likely could have been a few more minutes added to keep some of the cuts in, though I suppose that everyone will have their own ideas as to what should have been put back. But the most important aspects of the story and books remained in the movie. There were lots of smiles, lots of laughs and lots of jumps too. The villains were villainous, the heroes heroic. Harry Potter fans will know precisely what is going on. Those who have not read the books may be confused or unable to follow what is happening or why. But, as a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed it immensely. It was, in my view, far better than several of the previous instalments and is at least as good as the first two movies directed by Tim Burton. When J.K. Rowling says ""he got it"" when talking about the directors interpretation, I can finally think that she isn't just supporting the studio who has added to her fortune.",0
534,6.0,"How would you not want to, but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - The most awaited film premieres in 2010. Beginning were only waiting for the true film fans, and the usual audience had no idea that he would soon find himself in the fascinating world of dreams. Shrek's waited all this and would like the final, but even the most devoted fans wanted to see exactly Potter. And Harry was one competitor in this unequal war, but the Twilight that time had a crowd of anti-fans, and, frankly, the film failed. Oh yeah, by the way half of all those special women not so long ago fanatic from the boy in the glasses, hence the conclusion: all waiting for Potter. To laugh, to surprise, to pass the evening to see half-naked Radcliffe. In general, the reasons are many - the movie alone. And this movie before you.",0
535,7.0,"So, here we are: the beginning of the end for the Harry Potter film series - and there are both good and bad things to say about this first part of the last story. The film's main flaw is that it drags a bit in certain parts (like the portion in the Ministry of Magic, and a few individual scenes besides that) and makes you wish the characters would get on with whatever they're doing: some more editing definitely wouldn't have gone amiss. Meanwhile, some other parts, like Dumbledore's background and Grindelwald, are covered minimally, which may be confusing for someone who hasn't read the book.",1
536,9.0,"I read so many reviews and heard so many people saying that the Harry Potter franchise did not need the last book split into two movies, and that this one is way too slow to be enjoyable, but since the last book is the most important one and contains tons of information, I personally like the way they adapted it on the screen. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is definitely not full of action like the other movies, and there is a lot of camping and slow scenes, but every single scene leads to an important detail which is used later on in the franchise. The whole adventure of collecting the horcruxes is way more interesting with camping and thinking of the next location/move. Other than that, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a huge improvement as a picture. The movie generally looks way better than the older ones and with the darkening of the story, the acting became way more dramatic and attractive.",0

539,4.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 1, is the 7th film of the series, and I have to say it is the best one so far. All the sets, clothes, special effects and actors are great once again, and there was a little improvement on the script and on the direction, which makes this film a little less clumsy than the first six. Also, since they decided to split Deathly Hallows into two movies, that gives them plenty of time to tell the story, and they remain more faithful to the events of the book than ever.",1
540,8.0,"David Yates is credited for having pushed the Harry Potter franchise down a shallow gutter. The last 2 movies in the series were an average fare compared to the previous versions, but with the new Harry Potter movie, he manages to push it all behind, and he might have just brought the franchise back to its glory again. But be warned, if you proceed to watch this movie without having followed the previous movies, or at least have failed to read the books, then this movie will be clear to you as a person who has just been cast the 'Obliviate' spell (which in HP terms, purges a person's memory). Another piece of advice, this movie is much more mature and darker than the previous movies. What started out as a fantasy for kids has moved to the next level and taken over the mantle of a wholesome movie for all the fans of the franchisee.",0
541,9.0,"Although not my favourite book of the series, I do think that this is the best film yet.

However, from my personal point of view, even though characters like Voldemort have explained their backgrounds, the reason why they created voldemort's character is generally good and well-founded. The whole novel is very logical, and every plot is reasonable. Some of the hints are buried for a long time, but they are basically explained.",0

I think the next movie is going to be awesome for sure but this one was kind of boring to me and it also ruined the movie a bit that I watched it opening night and there were so many annoying kids screaming and wearing annoying costumes, trying to say the lines at the same time as the characters on the screen, etc, why do that?",0

To me it seemed like a shameless attempt at milking as much money out of the moviegoers as they possibly could. However, after having seen both of the final films, I now see that it was really the best course of action that the filmmakers could have taken.

It was just one random scene to the next, never explaining anything. Forgive me, this is my first review. For the first time I feel it necessary to tell someone how bad this movie is.

The trailer fooled the viewers that there is a dragon in it. I saw the movie and there was no dragon. Boycott this film it's not worth it. Maybe J.K. Rowling got lazy making the ending. She's the worst director ever. She ruined her movie. I hated this movie cause it's boring and it has no action. Watch Iron Man instead.

A lot of people think that making the 7th installment of the franchise into two parts was a bad idea but i highly disagree. A lot of the book elements were kept which i thought was cool. The only problem I had was I wanted to see more of the Dursleys in the beginning but none the less. People are always complaining that the movies take out important parts or parts that they love so when the directors and writers finally come up with a plan to fix this problem by making it a two parter, people don't agree. Being a reader of the books I though this was an excellent idea because it allowed for better pacing which really was good.

There is just too much in the book to condense into one movie, unless one makes a 5 hour movie. I have loved the casting for this series from the beginning, watching Harry, Hermione and Ron grow up has been a treat. I have read, more than once, all the books and Deathly Hallows is my favorite, and the movie I just finished watching is a credit to the book. Yes, there are changes, some threads (minor) missing but the spirit, the atmosphere, is all there. I particularly enjoyed Rhys Ifans portrayal of Xenophilius Lovegood, quite believable. The photography was outstanding and the apparition scenes fantastic. They came across better on screen than they did in my imagination. I keep reviewing the book in my mind, looking for a flaw or an error in the movie and I can't find one. I recommend this movie and am eagerly awaiting the second part.",1

There is just something about this film that leaves you with an amazing happy feeling but an eager feeling for the second one .

556,10.0,"This is a movie that should not be missed. It has it all, action, adventure, and fantasy. This I think is a bit better than part 2, simply because it has more action, and more suspense, which I love in movies. Many scenes that just give me the chills, although it is animated and on the ""unrealistic"" side of things. Such as when Ron gets shot by some spell and you see his skin on his arm is gone, and Hermine uses something that she puts on his arm, and you hear a sizzling sound. The ending of the movie is really good, and gets you really pumped up for part 2, when Voltemort (don't know how to spell that) get's the most powerful wand in the world. There are many scenes that make you tense up, and makes you feel as if there is a spider crawling down your back.

As the film begins you know from the first minutes that you are going to see a different, mature and dark movie. As it progresses and it comes to the end you realize that every expectation has fully delivered and maybe exceeded. Well, all i'm saying is that this movie has it all, comedy, action, adventure, drama, fantasy, suspense, mystery and even a bit romance. What else can the audience ask for? And also (for me at least) this part reflects the quality and the awesomeness of the second part. I hope and i believe that the second part will be this good or maybe even better, why not? So all Harry Potter fans (and not only) prepare for the biggest movie event of this year, cause this is going to be sooo amazing and memorable!",1
558,8.0,I thought that I'm a big H.P fan until I started to read the books. The movies was done so nice and great. In this part I wish if they added some of the things in the book. Like the letter from his mom to Sirius. Or like the time they went to the ministry of magic and saw Mr.Wesily. And like the radio station. I think it was essential to show that they are not alone and friends and family still with them. But in general the movies and the books made such a wonderful masterpiece.,1
559,9.0,"From the beginning I have been a fan of the movies. I never had the interest to pick up a Harry Potter book. OK OK, I'm lying I did read ""The Goblet of Fire"" and enjoyed it very much, but the first movie is what really got me hooked to J.K. Rowling's magical world. ""The Deathly Hallows Part one"" is certainly a departure from the rest of the series and is a breath of fresh air. Even though I loved the Quidditch matches, and the fun times at Hogwarts, I honestly did not miss it watching this film. Yes, they are grown up and the film itself is quite dark but there is room for some wonderful special effect sequences and comedic moments that aren't forced and arise from the situation. I love how each character has evolved and in this one the actors really have to dig deeper to convey their emotions. The acting is definitely better in this than any other Potter film, and the clear stand out for me was Emma Watson. I think artistically she was always the underdog when it came to acting. For me she really did steal the show in this one. The pacing of the film becomes a bit slow in the second act but it's never boring. The characters struggles amongst each other are quite fun to watch. David Yates has really captured the spirit of Harry Potter and the urgency it needed before it reaches its spectacular conclusion. We will have to wait til July 2011 for that, but for now the first part will have to do. Another wonderful extra to this film is a fantastically animated story explaining the story of ""The Deathly Hallows"". It was a real treat!",1
560,6.0,I love the this movie but I was disappointed in the Sky Battle.I think that was too short in the film. I don't understand the film makers. They had enough time for that scene. What do you think about it? Moreover in my opinion the dance scene was unnecessarily in the film when Harry and Hermione were dancing at the camp. They had to cut off this scene. I was so embarrassed by this scene I love the Harry Potter books and movies very much but I am waiting for more from the last two movie. The music was amazing. I am always listening this theme. In my opinion this film could be more powerful. In the next movie the battle was also too short.,1
561,5.0,"Throughout the Harry Potter films my main problem with them (other than the writers terrible opinions) is that they have quite bad pacing which is to be expected from adapting an extremely long book into a film but this film and it's continuation suffer most of all of the films because of it, some of the lore is interesting in this film but it honestly isn't very interesting as a film.",0

The First part of the Deathly Hallows movies works beautifully as a normal movie while being a fine addition to the Harry Potter movie series, though the movie changes the tone of the series dramatically as if the Goblet of Fire didn't do that enough. The movie does cram a lot into its running time, end in a cliffhanger and rely upon coincidences quite a bit but still manages to be a good movie because of the amazing acting and writing, making it a highly recommended movie.",1
563,8.0,Finished watching this movie for the first in an imax theatre or maybe they all are anyways the movie did its best to be honest to the book still steve kloves can't help but jump around as many scenes as he can even though the movie is 2 and a half hours long and the screenplay by steve kloves is good he should focus more time and effort acting was a s good as usual and of course laughs flying around the theatre whenever rupert grint would crack a funny one it also has some mature scenes of advancement such as hermione and harry dancing in the tent and when ron is trying to destroy the horcrux and in that horcrux he sees his worst fears it was definitely a good time in the theatre the movie does seem to slow down a little on certain scenes and then rush on others but im a die-hard harry potter fan and it was worth the trouble to get to see this movie,0
564,5.0,"Starting off Daniel Radcliff is really short. I'm anti twilight and this franchise is going down the same path, coupled with the fact that Rowling went mills and boony on the last two books this movie is really disappointing.

565,9.0,"The very first thing I'm glad about is that fair amount of justice is done for the book .I was worried if Yates would spoil the movie like Hp- 6 , but Good Heavens !! He didn't . Its the darkest ever .I'm really glad that they decided to give it in two installments . Now about the performances . The Trio have done well irrespective of the heavy burden of carrying the whole story . The battling of emotions between the three is portrayed really well . Now the screenplay . The seven potter's scene is funny and gives a really nice mood for the beginning .Te Sky battle Of'course is a big plus . But still , i wished it extended a bit more . The journey of the three through the rough is very interesting . The Sword , Godric's Hollow , Bathilda , Xenophilius , the quest for the real locket in the ministry ...everything is right in place as it was in the book . Dobby's end is very touching . The movie is dark , brilliant , adventurous and even funny in a few places . The story of The Three Brothers is very creatively crafted .The ending leaves you desperate to for the next part. Its a perfect ending for a terrific opening . Overall - a great movie and Thanks to Yates for going by the book .",1
566,9.0,"the film is loyal to the book without being boring. It has the right atmosphere - very dark, much tension, but there are enough funny moments to change the mood in the right time. Visual effects are stunning as they should be, wouldn't expect anything less than that. as a huge H.P fan, I'd say the film is highly recommendable.",1
567,8.0,"Bill Nighy is a perfect introductory character. He's the perfect vampire, although they could have touched his factions more like described in the book. Really prepares you for what is about to burst in.",1
568,10.0,"The progression of the Harry Potter movies getting steadily darker as they go along, from the charming and innocent Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to the dark and emotionally intense Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is well documented. But Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 goes a step further. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 takes the series outside its Hogwarts comfort zone and on the road. And the Wizarding World is now in the midst of a full blown war. While many of the events that occurred in Half Blood Prince setup the war, now this IS the war. With Harry, Ron and Hermione unable to return to Hogwarts, and, in any case, having to fulfill their mission for Dumbledore, the vast majority of Deathly Hallows Part 1 is set with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the road on the hunt to find and destroy Horcuxes. Thus, this movie is very different from any other in the Harry Potter series. While all the other Harry Potter stories either are school stories or at least have elements of school stories, Deathly Hallows Part 1 has none of that. Instead, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a more like a quest story. We get to some very familiar and beloved characters in a totally different type of setting and story. This both gives a freshness to a familiar series and makes this movie unique within the series. This is a major positive and adds another element to the Harry Potter series. It was also quite refreshing that this movie had none of that retarded romance garbage that was unfortunately included in the previous three Harry Potter movies. This movie keeps its eye on the ball and rarely strays from what's important to the plot. There aren't really any significant cast or character additions in this volume. Instead it's all about those characters we've loved for a long time. Daniel and Emma are fantastic in the lead roles and Evanna and Ralph Fiennes are splendid in their roles as Luna and Voldemort. And Helena Bonham Carter is delicious in her role as Bellitrix Lestrange. The most notable newbie is Bill Nighty as Scrimgouer. While this character does play some important roles such as giving Harry, Ron, Hermione the bequests Dumbledore had left them that proved important late, this character received too little screen time for his casting to be that important although Nighty does a good job in the role. The pacing is appropriate for the story being told. It is slower paced than its predecessors but the story being told here calls for being told at a slower pace much of the time. The music is good. I still would have preferred John Williams to have scored the entire series but the score here is high quality and appropriate to the film. The very best part of this movie is its awesome special effects and visuals. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a beautifully shot film with some of the best production quality you will ever find. The cinematography is perfect. The filmmakers threw an 80 yard touchdown pass with their production work on this movie. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. Most of the main events are included and portrayed faithfully. The main thing that book readers will notice lacking in the film is that there is much less focus on and less of Dumbledore's back story than in the book. I have no problem with this as the movies have always (rightfully) chosen to focus on Harry's story when doing the book to movie transition so issues less about him get less play. A change that I really liked was not using Polyjuice Potion for the Godric's Hollow trip. This made that part of the movie have more meaning and feel more genuine. You can really feel it when Harry says""This is where I was born. I'm not coming back as someone else. The movie is highly successful at bringing out emotions and this is most obvious during Dobby's death. This is a very moving scene. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older as this movie has some violent parts, including the torture parts at Malfoy Manor that are not appropriate to be seen by elementary school children. Dobby's death is also too emotionally intense for those below middle school. Faithfulness to the book: 9 out of 10. Casting and Acting: 10 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 11 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10.",1
569,5.0,"OK, I've not seen part 4, 5 and 6. I've seen the first three and now, almost, the last one. I know the backgrounds, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie was boring. The first 15 minutes and the last couple of scenes were good. The rest was an accumulation of nice forest shots and teenage bickering which once again confirms this is not an adult universe.",0
570,10.0,"I went For the afternoon show of deathly hallows pt1 but not with great expectations... as one of my friend who watched it earlier didn't liked it much. But the opening sequences only thrilled me!!!The great Warner Bros logo came out with much improvement in animation. There were very good points - as they followed the book , The visual effects , the acting and the Nagini close in was very terrifying!!! The locket scenes were well done and I literally cried at Debby's death.Radcliffe did a pretty decent role as did Grint and Emma.Just wanted that they should have shown the death of Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody. How could the have missed that!!!",1
571,8.0,"When I first discovered that they planned to split the final book into two full movies, I was pleased. While I understand the necessity of selectively editing the content of a book when it is adapted to the big screen, I was very disappointed in what the production team decided to leave out of some of the movies...particularly the last three. The decision to essentially make ""Deathly Hallows"" a 5+ hour movie split into two parts gave Me the hope that they would start the finale with Dumbledore's funeral and restore some of the elements previously dropped. ",0
572,5.0,"Well, when the rating showed 8.1/10 then my reaction was are you kidding me? What the movie has got only special effects and nothing else. The acting is nothing but average. The plot is not continuous - nothing happens for an hour and everything happens in 5 min. Then why the hell make a movie of utter rubbish for 165 min. And finally the dialogues, well I have seen better in B-grade movies. Only one thing I want to add and well, it is a request (or to put it strongly a demand from an irate movie lover) - can I have my money back please? Or rather pay me for going through such a disastrous ordeal! Definitely not looking forward to part 7.2.",0

Although the Movie missed many interesting Scenes according to Book like ""the presence of Viktor Krum in Fleur & Bill's Wedding"", ""Some scenes after the capture of trio in Malfoy Manor"" & ""Some talk during Death Eater Meeting at Malfoy Manor"" but it successfully delivered Dark, Thrilling and Suspense.

OK maybe less is left out from the book but I found myself looking at my watch and asking ""come on when is this gonna end?"". A few hours ago i was hyper-excited about this movie, but after seeing it I felt ""well, not a bad movie bet not a good one either"" So this is just my own opinion but as a viewer who does not know the story I felt bored an it was way too slow. Also I'm about to read the book and I'm planning to see the movie again afterwards, so if i have the opportunity I'll write another review from the perspective of a reader.",0

While the other film felt original this felt like i was actually watching lord of the rings with harry potter characters. It felt very rushed and had a fast pace which the others didn't have. Many Characters would either only briefly appear in the film some not at all and other were only mentioned in dialog. I have to really question the originality of the story harry having to travel with companions to destroy the horcrux's to defeat the dark lord.... wait where do i know that from ohhhh that's right frodo had to travel to mount doom and destroy the ring to defeat the dark lord, i knew that sounded familiar. Maybe you have to be a harry potter fan to enjoy this film but either way it is the worst out of all of them, but anythings better than twilight!",0

Yes, there are a few parts that move somewhat slow, but that is how it was in the book. The scene at Godric's hollow was just like I imagined, it was amazing. The ending is sad and keeps you on the edge of your seat, and there is comic relief. The midnight showing was great, and I would recommend it to everyone for Part 2. The plot is deep, the acting is great, and this is by far the most faithful movie to the books. Overall, not the most entertaining entry due to some of the lack of action, but it is by far the best.

In the scene where Ron is about to destroy the locket, and he sees Harry and Hermione taunting him, then kissing, all of a sudden they are both naked, caressing, and making out. I was horrified, embarrassed, and totally furious. I go to reasonable lengths to keep pornography away from my family, and there it was on the big screen in a Harry Potter movie! Unbelievable.

595,10.0,"First of all it's crucial to mention that I have grown up reading Harry Potter books. Since my 11 till now Harry Potter is an important part of my life. OK. It's easy to call me a nerd but I assure you I am not. When I first read the Philosopher's Stone I awaited to watch its movie. I admit I liked it, although many themes of the book were out... As the films were coming out I understood that the script-writer and maybe even J.K. Rowling was up to destroy all our love to Harry Potter's world. For example, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blod Prince"" was my favourite one of the series as a book, but the film really disappointed me. But, let's move on to that movie. When I was reading the epic finale of Harry Potter I was amazed and truly anxious that when it would be transfered into the big screen it may be worse than the 6th one. I WAS WRONG!!! The film kept me from the beginning. A marvelous opening sequence -even better than the book's I think-. But, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not watched it yet. Believe me though, the one quarter of the film will make you cry!!! There were some things that differed from the book (Xenophilius Lovegood's appearance, lack of Krum's argument, different way of catching Harry, Ron and Hermione in the woods) but it didn't matter. It was all excellent. I think it's the best of all Harry Potter films. HARRY POTTER MANIACS THAT'S THE FILM WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR",1
596,,"As the film progressed, the storyline got better. However, just like the last few Potter films, the beginning seems abrupt as if the viewer just jumped into the middle of a scene without proper introduction. Granted, I have not read any of the novels with the exception of the first, however, I shouldn't have to have read the books to have a clear beginning, should I? My main complaint about the Harry Potter films in general is the lack of good character development of the emotions between Harry and Hermoine. Each of the characters seems disconnected from one another, particularly the three main ones. This is totally unacceptable. Characterization can make or break a film. The feelings the characters have toward one another must be depicted and fully explored. I realize I haven't addressed much about the plot but the editing, sound, and scene development are all superb. I look forward to the final installment. The franchise will be missed, indeed. One final comment: there are aspects of dialog not heard that are shown in closed captions. I highly recommend viewing this film with closed captions turned on. I don't know why this is so - that the dialog is missing yet visually shown.",1

I may name myself a real fan of Potteriana, because I adore all the parts (as movies, as books) of it and I think everybody will agree with me, that Potter's world and the main theme of the saga are very wonderful, interesting, sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's enough sad, but, in total here's a great story for all the family...",1

Neither, when I left cinema. Well, OK, new movie of Harry Potter may serve the real Harry Potter fans with new movie to see; once, twice and then that's it. Real movie for fans is to see for 45 times! No impression! Moments of movie were exciting, filled with music but as a whole movie I'd say it was boring! Harry Potter wasn't supposed to be boring! All the books are masterpiece written like once in a while! And not to mention differences between book and movie. It's normal to see abnormalities, but so many? Like I was watching whole new story! That's just wrong. If I would not be such a fan of writing J.K.Rowlings I'd rate movie 5/10. It was just made for money! Still hoping for the very good last part of it.",0

606,10.0,"I liked this Harry Potter movie a lot for one basic fact. It followed most of the book! Most of the movies cut out things in the books that ""weren't important"" or didn't pertain to the plot. I liked this one because they took the time to look at the book. The reason they made the two movies is to satisfy those people who always complain about how the movies don't include everything in the book. I read other reviews were they say it was boring. Well it is what happens in the book. The beginning of the book is basically them moving through the woods looking for horcruxes hence why this movie is mainly in the woods. I liked that it drew out this part because it let the characters of Ron Harry and Hermione develop more. The only thing that I didn't like was how they didn't make Remus as big a focus as he is in the book. He is the last connection to Harry's father and I felt like they should have made him and Tonks bigger players in this movie. However other than that I really did enjoy this movie.",1

Although every nook and cranny could not be filled as with a book, the motion picture does an excellent job of capturing the fear, angst, passion, and depression that are so very easily displayed in the novel. The Actors have all matured wonderfully and it really shows that they are trying to earn their way legitimately as actors in the world. No longer able to ride the role of a child or adolescent, the 3 are sent off on their own as adults, completely responsible and alone. The film captured each character's... character really quite well. What we witnessed in the theater were by what seemed by all senses, real emotion.

Just saw this movie today. And I have to say this movie is definitely good, and also it entirely varies from the previous parts and it has been directed in a satisfying manner by David Yates. It is wickedly humorous, funny and dark at the same time. But the main difference from the other parts is that this movie is really slow paced. This movie is the darkest than the previous ones, because Lord Voldemort has regained his power and is deadly than ever. Harry ,Ron and Hermione are the only hope. There is no more Hogwarts in this chapter. All the three are grown up. They have to find their own way in the world to destroy the 7 horcruxes. ",1

Why did he have that thing on his forehead and who was Voldemort? I didn't really understand what the muggle was looking for and why he was banned from the underground place with the statues. Finally, what was Doby, was he like a kid or something, and if so why can he talk so well or did he have a defect that made him short. That was the only far fetched part of the movie, except for the magic, but I liked it. I hope they make another one.",1
622,10.0,"OK thats the 2nd time they have blown the International Statute of Secrecy to smithereens but apart from that this movie numbs you, goosebumps you, sends a shiver down your spine (like Dementors are nearby). A thrilling, very gripping and the loyalest to the great novels yet, this movie is a definite must-see. Lets start with the story; as I said it's very (almost completely) loyal to the book, you don't have to worry about that. Gripping, oh and BTW the Tale of the Three Brothers is filmed beautifully. Its very creative. Number two, is the acting of the three most likable stars, Daniel Radcliffe is politely and tauntingly replying to all those skeptics and critics that he's really grown into a marvellous actor and that he'll never ever be stereotyped. Rupert Grint has portrayed the brooding, friendly, a bit double-minded and the deepest fears of Ron Weasley as though they are his own, from now on versatility has a new meaning - Rupert Grint I am still recovering from this girl who I don't know why is trying to blow me away, apart............anything Emma Watson has shown that she's the top girl in Hollywood for a reason. She's attached to Hermione Jean Granger like they are Loving sisters and for that matter she shuts up those blabbing mouths that had been critical of the fact that she once thought of leaving the series and never fully or truly came back. Believe me I am not biased but these three are future Hall of Famers. Tom Felton hasn't had much to do yet cause Draco's major portion is the second part as is Ralph Fiennes's but I know they're gonna be great. The rest of the cast including everyone from Dobby to the newest Potter Cast member - Rhys Ifans (Xenophilius) and also Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), were an absolute delight to watch.I was so much absorbed in the movie that the 148 minutes of this fantabulous flick flew by like 20 minutes or so.",1

628,10.0,"Before the movie, we talked about how much more fun the Harry Potter franchise would be as a TV show, because that means that each season could be dedicated to a book and use anywhere from 12 hours to 17 hours to tell the story of each book. And some subplots could get their own episodes, like the various love affairs. This would have the benefit of resolving that storyline while isolating it from the darker happenings, and avoiding groaningly awful situationsÂ… On a TV show, you can have entire episodes that only minimally advance the main plot, but fill in the necessary color and resolve subplots. There's so many things that are half-explored that could, on a TV show, get an entire episode or two all to themselves.",0
629,10.0,"I LOVED IT. Not only has it been my favorite Harry Potter movie and was able to surpass HBP (which I thought was very hard), but it has been my favorite movie of all time. Like all harry potter movies have been, but this one was justÂ…. Incredible.",1

If you don't know what's been happening in at least the previous 2 or 3 films your lost chemosobe. I fear you would be so lost in this dark adaptation of one of the most read books of the past decade. I loved the end where Voldamort takes Dumbledoor's wand... Epic scene. I'm very happy with this movie, and will probably watch it several times before it leaves IMAX. Don't let anyone tell you you should wait for the blu ray. This is the best movie I've seen in the franchise yet and My pick for the best picture of the year. It has best actor written all over it. Daniel and Emma have really evolved into great actors over the years and there performances had better not be overlooked award season.",1

632,9.0,"As a die-hard HP fan, (meaning I've read every on of the books, some multiple times), I was more than satisfied with the this film. After being slightly disappointed and longing for something after the last couple of films, David Yates has brought the initial ""magic"" to the movie franchise that I haven't completely felt since the second film, The Chamber of Secrets. The ironic thing, however, is that this film was a MAJOR departure from the first few. As I'm sure any fan has noticed, the movies have gotten increasingly darker and darker, and this was no exception. Because the series has reached its highest point of intensity, this movie is exempt from familiar screen-shots of Hogwarts, jolly trips to Diagon Alley, Quidditch, the Great Hall, and even the familiar, ""cute and magical"" melodies often heard at the beginning of the films. The Hogwarts ""crew,"" (Neville, Cho, Seamus, Dean, etc.) are only shown once in the whole film, and only for a brief scene in which they chased off Death Eaters. The whole movie chronicled Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for horcruxes, enlightenment of the tale of the Deathly Hallows, and evasion from the Death Eaters, who are now stronger and more than ever, having taken over the Ministry of Magic.

634,7.0,"I was impressed as always with the film itself but it could have been cut down to a much shorter film. The layover in the different locations got a bit boring. I'm guessing without doing any exact timing it could have been cut down to at least under 2 hours. I'm hoping the final part will have a bit more action and less milling around. I would rather sit through a three to four hour single part film then have to wait 8 months for the final part. The old epic films when we'd sit through a 3Â½ hour film with an intermission would be perfect for this finale. They could have combined both parts, made it in 3-D and had a brief intermission.",0
635,7.0,"I have to say that I was quite disappointed with The Half Blood Prince. I expected it to be much darker and it failed to succeed with that effort.

636,10.0,"Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. The acting was fantastic. The trio plays their characters exceptionally well. Emma and Rupert was outstanding in my opinion. As for Daniel, well lets just say, those two has outshines him this time around. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was a very standout character, Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour certainly look like a lion, Helena's Bellatrix was menacing and torturous as ever, Snape was being himself like he always is, Lucius and Narcissa also plays their supporting role well (I love it when Narcissa shivers as Dobby was making his speech). However, I do think Ryhs Ifans's Xeno was 'over cooked' compare to the Xeno in the book.The Harry Potter series has inspired generations. I grew up with the books and the movies. As I grew, the characters, both fictional and actual actors grew with me.I am so impressed and excited about the accomplishments of this series.",1
637,9.0,"A very nicely executed film, remaining true to the book where possible- although changes made from the book were usually for the best to work on film- such as the limited use of Polyjuice Potion in the film, purely because it doesn't work on-screen very well. The use of Hedwig as the trigger for Voldemort's appearance was a much more successful way than the use of a spell. Much comedy was used throughout- but mainly from Ron or Dobby, who dominated every scene he appeared in (adding much needed tension relief to the plot). Steve Kloves has adapted a much more down-to-earth feel to the Harry Potter franchise in his screen-play of the book, but could be argued that it has lost some of its younger audiences due to heavy underlying issues and complicated plot, which can be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. Saying that, they did cut lots of the unnecessary sub-plots that are in the book, but fans may miss some of these 'meaningful' moments from the it.",0
638,10.0,"After HP6, I was beginning to worry that the HP films would turn into another example where we see the motion picture doesn't match well with the novel. I must admit that I am revealed after seeing this installment. The film was very well made and inline with the book. The emphasis given to different events is distributed in a good balance. You see a very good mixture of fear, confusion, and that slightest hope that the characters always keep with them. The psychology of every scene is wonderfully executed. I felt like I am also going through this journey with the characters on the screen. The division of the book into two films was a great idea and where it is split into two is perfectly chosen. You want to see more but you also feel like ""yes, part one is over, let's see the rest next year"". Congratulations to everyone in the cast.",1
639,9.0,"The best harry potter movie till date. It has amazing camera-work and the story has been shown beautifully. The good thing about this part is that it follows the book and thus would not disappoint the Potter fans...!! The locations that have been used for shooting are a treat for the eyes. This part of the movie is about creating the base for the last part. All the stories have been told, everything has been explained and now only finding the remaining horcruxes is left to be shown in the finale which is expected to set a benchmark. The stage is set....!! The performances are of top quality and the characterization is brilliant. The movie also doesn't miss out on comedy and makes the audience giggle even between some very serious scenes. There is one slight suggestion for everyone, try reading the book once before going for the movie, its more enjoyable that way. Eagerly awaiting the second installment....!!",1
640,6.0,"I wont go into too much detail as to why I'm disappointed with this movie. That being said, I still remain disappointed. There were some points in the movie I did enjoy but the pacing, in whole, was dreadful. Much like the last Harry Potter film. I don't know why we needed to see HP and HG dance in a tent. Was that really relevant? The flow was so slow, when something finally did happen, I forgot to care about the most important aspect of the film, imo, the characters.I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this franchise. David Yates Maybe??? I am sure, however, that I would not advise my friends to spend $25.00, per couple, to see this in the theater. Definitely a ""renter"".",0
641,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 is automatically very different from the previous films. Why? Firstly, at no point during the film is it set at Hogwarts where the other films have been centrally based. Some may not like this change of scenery, however I do because it gives a sense of freedom (and growing up) for the three protagonists. Again this next installment of the saga gets even darker with more deaths, fights, snakes and torture. There is a reason why such films are placed with a certificate of 12, so I suggest that youngsters should not be taken in less you know they can cope. Even I jumped a few times with the appearance of the snake. Again this Gothic feel adds to the sense of growing of age and freedom, as the three protagonists get a feel for what real life is like after leaving the relatively safe haven of Hogwarts. Dangerous; particularly if you are the infamous Harry Potter or are friends with him. Many people have been disappointed with the film, saying that not as much occurs compared with the other films, however, don't forget it is only part 1, and all those who have read the book will know that we have saved the best 'til last, and that this film is setting up for the explosion as the series concludes. So please wait until you have seen the second part before you make your concluding opinion of the film, because some things may not add up until you watch the second. Part 1 focuses mainly on the three protagonists, their relationship with each other, and the task that Harry Potter has put upon himself, with the help of his friends. The film also shows how wicked Voldermort and his other death eaters are, particularly Helena Bohnam Carter, who plays her part fantastically.",1

Deathly Hallows part 1 however seriously failed to meet my expectations. The film starts off with and awesome shot of Bill Nighy promising magic and fun and a battle between teen wizards and the gestapo, what we get however is 2 hours of extremely slow paced plot dabbled with wizarding fights. Don't get me wrong I LOVED some of the parts though the parts that I did love were so few and far between that at times it seemed like a chore to watch. I understand that this film was setting up everything for part 2 and that they wanted to split the book into 2 fairly lengthy films BUT this really wasn't necessary if it meant losing the thrilling nature of the film. I would've been perfectly happy to sit through 3 hours of fast paced frivolity compared to 2 hours of dribble that MAYBE will pick up in part 2.",1

The only effective scene in this was when Dobby died. I think they should have cancel having the last 2 movies in 2 parts. And make just 1 movie which is actually exciting. The movie has pretty good acting and fun moments, but there is no chance that I would even consider watching it again, or even downloading it. I was very disappointed after and couldn't believe that I actually wasted money to see this rubbish. There was nothing interesting in this movie. I give this movie a 5 out of 10. Btw.

649,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, is the third Potter film to be helmed by director David Yates. Since Yate's catastophe he called, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" got bad reviews, he kicked it up a notch, directing beautifully in, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". This time, in Deathly Hallows, he kicks it up about 12 notches. Beautifully filmed, this Potter film is without question, the best. The film really is brilliantly acted as well, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint really give it their all in this sometimes emotional and dreary entry. Radcliffe is still mediocre though, and we can't help but feel that his acting is kind of weak at points. But Helena Bonham Carter's over-the-top Bellatrix counteracts that weakness, even though she is in the film for only a small period of time. Alan Rickman as Snape, is barley even there in this film. We see him once in the film's killer opening sequence, but then he vanishes.",1

This is the darkest Harry Potter film in my opinion. My other problem was that there was not much magic and imagination in this one. I missed the quidditch matches and enchanted things. This film was all about traveling and hiding. I eventually got bored watching the trio travel from place to place, setting up a tent. Don't get me wrong, this is a great film (as all of the Harry Potter movies were). Despite the negative things about this movie, there were a lot of positive things as well. There was comedy and tons of action. And I love the little cliffhanger at the end. Overall, pretty good movie! Totally recommend it.",1
657,,"I absolutely love this movie; from the chase scenes to the heart stopping moment when you believe something big is going to happen it is brilliant. I have to admit that even though I am in love with this movie some of it was a letdown, the whole movie was about going camping and these teenagers going through hormones, and searching for clues like Scooby-doo but slower because they were hardly getting anywhere. I like the way that they confront their fears but did anyone else see the lord of the rings connection? I mean seriously 'copyright', this horcrux is just like the one ring - it causes people to get angry and makes then sort of evil inside (when Ron was wearing it and couldn't take the horcrux's power, he thought Hermione was in love with Harry = awkward) I'm telling you someone has to tell J R R Tolkien about J K Rowling coping ideas.

It was everything in it, drama, action, mystery, comedy, but the drama was the best for me. The strong relationship between Hermione, Ron and Harry is emotionally strong and absolutely coming through the screen so you can feel it, like I did.

662,8.0,"The problem with adapting a book like the Deathly Hallow, the final story in an incredibly rich fantasy saga, is that after 7 films and with so many characters and elements introduced, it's near impossible to bring it all together for one final satisfying film. Indeed the flaw of the films as a whole is that they've inevitably lacked the same depth as the source material and the filmmakers have at times rather neglected non-readers of the book by failing to explain certain things, something that is perhaps more apparent under Yates' direction. As a film however, Part 1 is a very good attempt and possesses as much magic and charm as the series has always had whilst trying to be something uniquely different. Director David Yates has been perhaps unfairly criticised in the last film for focusing so much on the characters instead of paying attention to specific details in the plot (contradictory I know) but here in Part 1, Yates finally seems to have struck that balance.",0

But I took some friends with me that didn't read the books, and for the most part didn't watch the movies. Now these friends I took actually had troubles understanding what was happening, and it was at that moment I realized that this is the first HP film where they made it not to help the general public understand, that they stayed true to the book as much as possible and the subtle changes they made actually fit, almost exceeded the book in a sense.

The movie is brilliant , it has everything it needs to be a good movie but without being your typical blockbuster . It gives the viewers what they want and it gives the readers what they want. It has thrill, action and suspense. It's grim but not to grim, it's dark but not to dark.

In conclusion, this movie did had some good action and some funny moments, but if you were to choose between this and a party, I would choose the party because the director made 3 crappy films in a row, and although this was better than the crappy 5th and 6th films, it was still on my ""waste of my time"" list. I certainly hope that they won't screw up part 2, because if those kids are getting millions of dollars for this crap, then someone's gonna get sued.",0
688,,"Has a bunch of flaws. Probably not the best potter movie.!! Not as magical & graphical as the first.. Not a movie i would recommend first time potter movie watchers, The fans will watch it anyway....:-) Personally i feel, The movie needs to be edited a lot.. people expect some flashy spells and wizardry on the screen.. Not the trio hanging out in forests and scenic locations.!! Nope..'prisoner of azkaban' still remains my favorite... I speculate a better part 2 though.!! As to conclude and to add a few more lines, for the site won't let my review be less than ten linesXD..6 stars for the movie..it would have been more if harry made his eyebrows a bit thin..",1

692,7.0,"I've been watching Hollywood movies ever since I came to this world (*sarcasm*) and I always concentrate on two aspects of the movie, the acting and dialog delivering. This past week I've been going over the whole Harry Potter series watching three young kids become teenagers, their acting, expression and confidence improving with every epic episode of the series. Taking into consideration the latest of the series ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part I"" there were a lot of new faces as compared to the previous episodes. The good thing about the movie was the storyline that mostly revolved around Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Some of the acting scenes were really exceptional but I was a little disappointed in Rupert and Emma's acting. The reason being, I couldn't see the same enthusiasm and passion which they portrayed in the previous episodes.",1
693,6.0,Saw the first show along with my wife who never read any of the Potter series but was infected with my enthusiasm for the first day's show. Throughout the movie I could not stop thinking how she would be feeling as it is impossible to appreciate any scene if you have not read the books. There is where LOTR triumphs.,1
694,9.0,Have followed the franchise religiously so far.. this one is better.... Really better. ,1
695,10.0,When i read that people say that this wasn't loyal to the book..I'm in shock. They split this up into 2 parts. How is that not the MOST faithful adaptation to the book? As a movie and book adaptation..it's the best out of the series. The actors were superb..the visuals were stunning..and the directing is better than ever for HP films. This is top notch film making. You may have to know a lot from the previous ones to understand what is going on. There is a point at the movie where it gets kind of slow..but it helps tell the story..and it is only about 20 minutes. I had high expectations for this and the movie exceeded those expectations. I can't wait to see part 2.,1
696,9.0,"Watched the movie and i must say it is indeed a very good movie.Boring sometimes in scenes but they catch up.Although i must say that i expected more from this movie and it was not that good.If this part 1 is good with all that road trips and limited action what we expect from part 2 [ to those who read the book may understand my point battle of hogwarts,theft from gringotts so many deaths and action and interesting facts revealed like snape was double agent and more]",0
697,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 is automatically very different from the previous films. Why? Firstly, at no point during the film is it set at Hogwarts where the other films have been centrally based. Some may not like this change of scenery, however I do because it gives a sense of freedom (and growing up) for the three protagonists. Again this next instalment of the saga gets even darker with more deaths, fights, snakes and torture. There is a reason why such films are placed with a certificate of 12, so I suggest that youngsters should not be taken in less you know they can cope. Even I jumped a few times with the appearance of the snake. Again this Gothic feel adds to the sense of growing of age and freedom, as the three protagonists get a feel for what real life is like after leaving the relatively safe haven of Hogwarts. Dangerous; particularly if you are the infamous Harry Potter or are friends with him. Many people have been disappointed with the film, saying that not as much occurs compared with the other films, however, don't forget it is only part 1, and all those who have read the book will know that we have saved the best 'til last, and that this film is setting up for the explosion as the series concludes. So please wait until you have seen the second part before you make your concluding opinion of the film, because some things may not add up until you watch the second. Part 1 focuses mainly on the three protagonists, their relationship with each other, and the task that Harry Potter has put upon himself, with the help of his friends. The film also shows how wicked Voldermort and his other death eaters are, particularly Helena Bohnam Carter, who plays her part fantastically. Unfortunately I thought that as they have two film to make from one book, that the film would not skip over or just briefly show certain events and aspects of the story. But, it does. For instance the film does not explore why Lucius seems almost weaker and more afraid of Voldermort than he usually has been in the other films. Overall, I thought it was a very good film, not the best I have ever seen, but certainly one I would like to see again. Having read the book, I cannot wait until the second part comes out as I think it will be the best one yet. :)",1
698,,"Announcing an end to the Potter series, this is the first of two parts of the final chapter of the enigmatic Potter franchise. When i went to see this movie i had no expectations at all. but i came back with some from the second part of the same. the story unfolds quite smoothly although some parts take quite some time to play out. David Yates is surely in the stage of evolution and will definitely supply a string of good films if he does not loiter in there for too long. he has tried to embroider a childish story with maturity, and the effect is worth noticing. his efforts are let down by the weak characters and their childish emotions which is no doubt expected of them at their given age. but the trio hardly look like 16 years old and look more like nearing 20. the atmosphere is impeccably built from the beginning of the film and Yates does not fail to generate the thrill with a few well conceived and naturally enfolding action sequences.",1
699,10.0,"My expectations were already very high with this movie & pleasantly the movie exceeded it. I am glad the movie was shot in two parts, doing full justice to the book. The director maintains the sombre mood of the book throughout the movie. The chase sequence where Hagrid and Harry escape the death eaters is awesomely shot(which makes the wait for the sequel even more painstaking). I still wish Voldemort had more screen presence. For people who have not read the book, the scenes where Voldemort is shown conversing with Ollivander & Gregorovich might be a bit confusing. But you can never expect the movie to capture the full essence of the book. The three protagonists finally get a chance to display their acting prowess. Ron and Hermione are brilliant and Harry does well too. Lots of people keep dying in the movie & unlike the 6th part, this movie gives due respect to all those events. The end is particularly heart touching. The movie kinda ends abruptly setting up things brilliantly for the epic finale. Cant wait for it anymore.",1
700,7.0,"Having been a fan of the books, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. For those who have never read the books it will be a good movie, slow at places but worth seeing. However I felt when watching the movie there didn't seem to be reasons for what they were doing, they just seemed to automatically know things, such as Gregorovitch was a wand maker. Also I thought an important part of the book was that Voldemort's horcruxes were in objects owned by the founders or that they were in places that were important to him/been to. This movie they seem to be groping in the dark and they keep repeating that the horcruxes could be anything? It just seems strange as how would they be able to find anything if they didn't know anything about them or any idea what they could be? Again with the added scenes, they could have been replaced by some scenes that they missed out in the book maybe? I mean from that movie it almost looked like Harry had feelings for Hermione. In saying all the things that was wrong with the movie there were many positive aspects as well. The movie portrayed the desperation and despair that the world was after the ministry has fallen and Voldemort has taken over. The scenes when they go to the Ministry and at Godrics Hollow were really good and the scene with Dobby at Shells Cottage was extremely well done after being such an important scene in the book, the movie did it justice. Overall the movie was worth seeing and I can't wait to see the final movie of this fantastic series...shame we have to wait till next summer for that!!!!",0
701,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 is undoubtedly that delicious dish which Potter fans around the globe have been waiting for...Script writer Steve Kloves has done an excellent job in this film....He hasn't failed to capture even a single significant event from the book....Potter maniacs must be rejoicing to watch on screen what they have been visualizing for more than 3 years......the real acting skills of Dan, Emma & Rupert has been exposed...they are simply superb as a team!!!!....At times it is a 100 times faster than 'the half-blood prince', and at other times it's a 100 times slower than the 'half-blood prince'. Several incidents which are not told in the book have also been included,which make the movie even more enjoyable....There are some breathtaking scenes that are more thrilling than any of the ones in the previous six movies.....Those who haven't read the book will surely find it extremely difficult to comprehend the storyline since it's much much more complex and trickier than the previous ones....After watching this movie, a true harry potter fan would feel pity for those who call the franchise a non-sense obviously because they don't have any idea of this epic story....TO ALL HARRY POTTER FANS, YOU'LL REGRET LATER IF YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE OF MISSING THIS ONE....this one sets a fantastic platform for the epic finale...it's just disappointing that we'll be able to catch it only after 8 months.....LONG LIVE HARRY POTTER!!!!!",1
702,4.0,"At the outset, I have to say that I went to see the movie with hardly any expectations as like all Harry Potter movies, the ending is always the best part, where the various disjointed characters and acts come together to create a spectacular finale. So in stark contrast, the viewer knows that this movie is not going to reveal the final symphony and that is a spoiler as the viewers know that this part will be dreary and boring; mostly due to the original script of the book. The fact that Deathly Hollows is considered the weakest of the Harry Potter series does not really help this movie. On top of that, the story meanders away from the flow in the book and leaves the viewers with a sense of Jamais Vu.",0
703,10.0,"Harry Potter story took a turn and came out of the world of fairy tales into the real world with realistic real-life emotions and problems, while still giving the viewer the amazing and cruel world of dark magic. This movie is scary, this movie is suspense, this movie is romantic. It keeps you on the edge of the seat and makes it hard to wait for the conclusion of the series. Ralph Fiennes is kicking butt, but what is also apparent is how a small boy Daniel Radcliffe turned from an insignificant child franchise actor into a world class award worthy talent. Ron Weasley is over-acting as always, but it works for him in this one. A tragic death of an imaginary character ""Elf"" was so meaningful and foretelling that it watered my eyes. A story about the deathly hallows, was like a movie inside a movie. It took a viewer out of the Harry Potter movie into a different world (different both artistically and thematically) - it was a brilliant spark of genius imagination of J.K. Rowling, and would be worthy to watch just by itself.",1
704,9.0,"It's the film moment of the year that we've all been waiting for â€“ Harry and his wizard gang are back for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" to fight crime once again in the world of Wizardry. We all expected the film to have us on the edge of our seats, chewing our nails down to the skin, and for the those that got up at midnight to get the book back in the days, probably crying. I can't lie I was on the edge of my seat, nibbling away, only to be severely disappointed that the film is in fact in two halves. I never got chance to reach the crying phase, should there have ever been one! Although the film makers did give us warning, I still felt some kind of conclusion was snatched away from me, being an avid book fan and all.",1
705,5.0,"This really is nothing special whatsoever, after Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince, I thought the film would have escalated to have much more suspense and a lot more action. I left bitterly disappointed. A brief synopsis of this very poor mess of a film is that Harry and his friends now go and find horcruxes and intend to destroy them, however they spend the whole film looking for one. This is nothing more than 2 hours of them camping in the forest, a very small battle with 2 wizards who nobody has ever heard of and a brief stand-off at Malfoy Manor. You should see it just to know what is happening if you haven't read the book. However if you have read the book and do not want to be disappointed - do not waste your money. It is nothing more than a money making strategy, this film is by far the worst Harry Potter film ever made. It is so bad that I sometimes forget that it was even released, I sometimes catch myself saying "" It's been ages since the Half-Blood Prince was released wasn't it? "" and my friends would reply with "" I know, but they made Deathly Hallows part 1 didn't they back in November? "". I barely recognise it as a film, it's more of a trailer for the part 2 if I'm completely honest. 5/10, poor, but not awful. Boring film, too long and too tedious. David Yates is going to have to give us something very special in part 2 to wash the away the horror of part 1.",0
706,10.0,"First of all the movie was the most awesome of the big novels. I mean the director always has to change screenplay for big novels because of their sheer size. The Potter fans who only watch the movies and never read the novels will find every movie awesome but for the ones who read the novels and come to watch the movies, they will always be a tad bit disappointed. This one was not that. David Yates had the tough task of making a movie out of a book which for us fans holds a special place in heart. He did a great job of it and hope something good from the second movies as well. There are one or two disappointments but overall very spine chilling and enjoyable especially the dangerous scene where Hermione is left to fend off against a group of pure blood supremacists. The scene where Dobby dies was as emotional in the movie as in real life, but the burial was a bit incomplete. The actors have grown in stature as their characters too. Emma Watson did very well in her emotional scenes and the guys were good too. For me the best movie out of the lot. Waiting for the DVD's to come out now.",1
707,9.0,"This is my favorite Harry Potter movie by far and it stays as true to the book as can be expected. I wish The Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince had made the same effort. It's a very dark film, but it is very satisfying for a Harry Potter fan who has read all the books. It's nice to see the characters really mature and we get to see a lot of the characters from Goblet of Fire. This is not a sappy Twilight film with the Happily Ever After scenario, since the two franchises are always being compared. Every moment of happiness is hard won and it's fleeting at best. There was not a sound in the theater because everyone was so caught up in the film. Since I don't want to spoil anyone, I will leave it at this. I can't wait to see the final installment!",1
708,6.0,"Another Harry Potter movie which is definitely much better than the book! No offence to Ms. Rowling but her writing since the Goblet of Fire, lost its heat. The Deathly Hallows is a movie which should not have had another part. Its a money move by the producers which makes an otherwise good movie into a waste of time. The gore factor has been increased with also in increased dark-nature to the movie line. The movie's first half seemed like it was there just to fill in the 146 minutes of Runtime and it was horrendously boring. If this wasn't a money train people would've easily made the movie into 1 part. The acting as usual is beyond sucky, with no expressions other than 0.o by all the actors except for Ralph Fiennes. One time watch in your Cinema hall. I wouldn't recommend the 3D version as the normal one gives one a headache as itself. Fanboys need to look at the movie without bias.",0

711,6.0,"This doesn't make me want to see part II. It just drags on forever, very slow. At least an hour of this should have been left on the editing room floor. By far the worst of the series so far. I need 10 lines to be able to submit this, so let me just say, save your money. There is nothing about this one that needs to be seen in a theater. There was two and a half hours of my life I wish I had back! Not a good movie. Moves along like watching paint dry. They should hurry up and get the next one out, it's already hard to believe Daniel Radcliff is under 30 years old. Save you're money. Save you're money. Save you're money. Save you're money.",0

Here the characters find themselves in a completely new, unfamiliar environment. They get out of various dangerous situations with the help of their ingenuity and magic. Romance is developing more and more in the series. Some turns came as a big surprise to me. The eaters are becoming more dangerous and the main characters face many dangers. We see a lot of references and past characters. In general, the film is very good!",1
718,9.0,"One of my favorite movies is Harry Potter. It is a whole series of movies directed by Chris Columbus. The first film was released in 2001 in the United Kingdom. The movies are based on the books by Joan Rowling. The story is about an orphan boy living with his uncles and aunt. On his 11th birthday, Harry unexpectedly discovers he has magic and goes to Hogwarts. There he meets Hermione Ron, and the main events of the film take place with them. The setting of the movie is simply mesmerizing in its beauty, the delightful scenery, the flying around on broomsticks, everything immerses you in this magical world. I really like these movies and recommend them to all people of all ages.",1
719,9.0,"As a Harry Potter fan, this was a long anticipated watch for me. I was so excited to see this film and had high expectations. Needless to say part one of the deathly hallows exceeded my expectations. First, this film is for sure PG-13 for a reason because Harry and his trio go through and experience older situations and there is a lot of death in the movie. Yate's ability to make the book come alive is unreal, and the plot had all of the fan favorites: romance, thriller, and adventure. I feel like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint completely transformed into their characters and brought me into the movie with them. I was able to feel the emotions in the scenes because of their amazing acting ability/range. Also, the background music choices were so fitting for the movie, they couldn't have been better. This film has crushed my heart and put it back together with the amazing acting and cinematography. Beware Harry Potter fans, tears will come... Go watch this movie!!!",1

There are many small details and scenes that only a true Harry Potter fan would be able to recognize. I am very glad that the producers decided to split the Deathly Hallows in half... this is obviously needed to really capture the magic of the novel. Not only is this movie accurate, but as a film, it is pretty stunning! The cinematography is simply marvelous! The acting is superb! Being a teenager, I feel as if the characters have grown with me... the film series has grown perfectly with its generation, which gives many viewers that much of a greater experience! I laughed hysterically, I watched in horror, and I cried (all of which I did while reading the book). Cannot wait for Part II, and once again be THAT kid that goes into the theater dressed up not like Harry Potter, but a true Hufflepuff, specifically Ernie McMillan. Keep it coming!!!",1
722,,"David Yates's adaptation of Deathly Hallows is perhaps the best HP adaptation I have seen to date, comparable only to Cuaron's third, visually enticing installment. Here, in Deathly Hallows, Yates experiments with mood, making a film that is truly gritty and entertaining. Not once do we, the audience, forget the dangers that the main trio are in. Every shot of this film is sprinkled with gloom and intensity, as is appropriated since the novel is no different. Firstly, I must praise the performances. Never had the trio given such nuanced performances. Gone are the days when Hermione bossed her two buddies around with her snobbish remarks and prudish sneers; gone are the days when Ron was regarded as mere comic relief; and gone are the days when Harry was just a mere wide-eyed boy, marveling at the beautiful expanse of his world. Emma Watson now plays Hermione with a sense of conviction and realism, Rupert plays Ron as a relatable human being capable of feeling a wide variety of emotions (including a keen sense of jealousy), and Dan plays Harry as an average guy who happens to be coping with the reality of his circumstances the only way someone of his age would know how. I like how Yates manages the scenes between the three, giving their friendship a great deal of depth. He is finally given the time to emphasize their dialogues, which--overall--enhances the character development.",1
723,8.0,"Well, I've read all of the HP books and I'm a huge fan. The movie received an 8/10 from me, and even though it was a great movie, there were many things that were left out. The first time I went to see this movie with one friend; eventually, I had seen it 4 times within the first two weeks because friends of mine who have *not* read the books did not understand, so I returned and actually had to explain why this was happening etc. I feel like more emphasis should have been placed on a certain character who is crucial in part II, and a character who should have died wound up surviving. How they will explain that in Part II is beyond me. Visually, it was breath-taking. The acting, superb (of course!) You can really feel as if you're THERE while on the journey. It is a bit of a tear-jerker for the sensitive people, but mainly because you realize that this is the movie before the **very** last one and you know it's coming to an end :P Some characters took on the role of others, which is expected in book-to-film adaptations; I loved this movie, however I feel that people should read the book before going to see it to really grasp what's going on. Then, many things from the previous movies will make sense and you'll be able to understand it better. I feel I shouldn't have had to tag along and commentate on the movie 4 more times -__-. Still love it though, because I'm a Potter fan :)",1

Sitting in the movie theater, you do not realize that you have been watching this amazing movie for well over two hours until it cuts to black and the credits begin to roll. Harry Potter fans, such as myself, know that this is only the beginning of the battle and all the crazy confusing battles are not until the latter half. Where the split the film is a good decision, but it leaves the viewer dying for the second part; probably great planning on WB's behalf. Well done. It is lacking something though, but as someone who read the books I'm going to believe that something is missing, but overall it is an amazing adaptation.",1
726,4.0,"One of the great joys of the Harry Potter movies has been that I've been able to take one of my grandnieces to see them. She loves them. However, she just turned 11 and so won't be able to go to this one. Why? -- because of ONE scene that did NOT need to be done the way it was.... the hallucination would have been just as effective in making it's point if the CGI version of those involved had been clothed, and the film could have been PG as the others have been. I enjoyed the movie, until that scene and all I could think of is ""oh @#$%, I won't be able to take her to this one and she's going to be seriously bummed""... effectively diminishing my enjoyment of the rest of the film and almost leading me to walk out of the theater. That one scene took away a lot of the audience by blocking out kids who've seen all the ones before it. Shame on the producers for not taking them into account when making this one. They effectively thumbed their noses at a good section of potential audience, and I hope the box office on this one suffers for it. If you decide after making a series of PG movies that the next one in the series should be rated so that a good portion of your audience-base can't see it, you deserve to have your wallet suffer for it. There are now a slew of kids all across the country who are seriously bummed (right before Christmas no less) -- why? Because some moron(s) decided that it doesn't matter if they're old enough to see this movie or not -- even if they've seen all the previous ones in the series, they didn't count enough to take into account... idiotic, short-sighted, and even into ""mean"" IMO.",0

The acting of the main three characters, Harry - Hermione & Ron is absolutely splendid... with a special mention of Emma Watson who has truly lived up to the character's reputation.

The most exact scene from book to movie was probably when Harry has to dive in the pond to fetch the sword of Gryffindor and Ron must save him. I thought I must have scene that scene of the movie somewhere else, but I haven't which is great for Harry Potter fans.

I have had my reserves with the previous installments in the series, noteworthy being OOTP.... but this truly is what we have been waiting for over the last decade.... Deathly Hallows is what I have believed Potter films should really have been.. it's the best one yet out of the franchise ... Not only does it capture the book in the most loyal manner possible, but also excels at instilling the spookiness that needed a cinematic wizardry of the level which Yates seems to have pulled of fairly well... Now to transpire a novel of such spellbinding excellence is no mean task; much of which is quite evident in the first scene of the movie itself..if you have grown to associate with the characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione, you would find yourself with moistened eyes in the first scene itself ( my sis had few trickling down her cheeks) ....this has been said over n over again in hordes of review ...but the trio truly come of age in this one.. the subtle moments of love... the value of friendship and above all, the magnitude of sacrifice friends make for each other .... underlines the moral that JKR has woven intrinsically throughout the series...

737,,"i've been looking at these rankings for two years and I don't get the fascination with POA, and why people rank it so high. as a fan of the books and movies since the first book came out, i've enjoyed watching the characters get older, and the tone grow darker, more serious and more emotional as each goes on. none of the movies are bad, but let's be serious, starting from the bottom, the last 3 in line are sorcerer's stone, chamber, then POA. they're too young! how can people have a movie that doesn't even have voldemort in it (POA) as the #1 ranked constantly?? the introduction of voldemort in goblet of fire, sirius' death and dumbledore v. voldemort in OOTP, dumbledore's death in HBP? these movies are way more better and contain so much more action and meaningful and memorable moments. the more older they are, the more darker the story becomes, the higher i rank the movie personally. here's my list top to bottom:",1
738,9.0,"So i must start by saying that I am a huge fan of harry potter! Now, the evolution of the harry potter films has been a continuously tarnishing event. In my opinion, from the POA and on the movies were beginning to be terrible. No character development and limited magical experience. In HP and the Deathly Hallows part 1, another factor stood out. The fact that characters were not dressed in shabby clothes finally got out. Why did they insist on having the characters dressed like hobos. Anyways, I had definitely lost hope in the movies since i saw order of the Phoenix and half-blood prince. This movie rekindled my desire and love of the films. I thought breaking the book in the two parts was pivotal to contained most of the plot. At first I was afraid it would be a bust because it would not contain the battle of Hogwarts and I thought it would be Harry , Ron and Hermione just walking in forests the entire movie. I was wrong. Deathly Hallows part 1 contained a balance of action, drama and of course magical display. The struggle of the protagonist is so evident and illustrated extremely well. I need to see it again. and if you haven't, you should really consider it. The films are no longer suited for children but a more mature audience, so give it a try. If fantasy isn't your scene, this contains a great plot line anyways and its very possible you will enjoy this movie. The ending is a great cliffhanger and set up for what I am sure will be the greatest and of course the last of the Harry Potter films.",1
739,9.0,"i saw the preview show yesterday,,,i cant wait for the next part....story was wonderfully depicted on screen.....all HP freaks watch it ......climax is not rosier but its adequate to create enthusiasm for next one ... on brief--",1
740,8.0,"This part of harry potter was,as always,good on the acting,environment etc,but on a whole it was a downer. I had very high expectations but didn't meet the repo. Almost no action sequences were its worse point. 2D version has nothing to offer except proceeding in the story. This movie was only like a setup for the second part. Some scenes were like action with Nagini,breaking the Horcrux etc were worth watching.For those who have read the book,this movie becomes even more of a disappointment.For those with patience,it would better to wait till the second installment and watch both together. I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. The soul of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak countryside to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes.",0
741,10.0,"The 7th film by Harry Potter franchise is not just good.Is more than this.This adaptation of J.K. Rowling's work of art looks a mix of emotions.I cried,I laughed,I feel all the emotions that I had when I read the book in 2007.The details that they put in the film can look unnecessary,but for the ones who read the book,they know that details are everything.And beyond this,the special effects,the art direction,the direction,and all the technical things in this film are Oscar worthy,seriously.The academy ignored all the films,but this one worth attention,cause it's a perfect film.I totally agree with Warner when they decided to do 2 parts for this book,cause in this way all the book can be transformed in a motion picture.If i wouldn't give an 10 to this film i would be lying,cause this is a masterpiece.",1
742,10.0,"deathly hallows is a sheer winner in all grounds,dialogs are apt,the music is brilliant and has a sense of growing danger to it,the performances are fabulous specially Emma Watson is delicious to watch and the cinematography brings out the isolation and loneliness of the trio.. there is no more quidditch no time for fun except one or two perfectly timed humorous lines...",1
743,8.0,"Now this movies seems to be spit on by some, and just loved to the core by others.And people are lost to why this seems to be happening. I think it's mostly from the people that have read these Novels, and who have just watched them. That seem to be saying these to totally different points of view. To the ones that say it was awful. Seem to think it was slow and nothing really happened. But to the ones who say other. Are finally happy they stayed to the Novels more then the other movies.",0
744,9.0,"Far better than 'Half Blood Prince' a tighter more up to date feel about it. Sarted well and set the tone The Durleys leaving - well done. Malfoy Mantion - good feel to it. Inside the Ministry - good choice. Though tweaked from the book it all worked really well. Some parts are left out from the book, or just hinted at, but enough to keep fans happy. I loved the books and thinks fans will be pleased. Everything worked, and flowed smoothly. A couple of bits were added,or slightly changed and I can see why. Doby and Kreacker looked more detailed and less puppet like,. And Snape had washed his hair (new wavy wig?) nice...lol. Really good..............could hear a pin drop in the cinema. Really looking forward to the next one.",1
745,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 1 is the best movie I have seen in 2010, I might sound prejudiced to those who aren't ardent admirers of the series. Firstly one shouldn't compare books to movies, because if one does that, he ends up finding flaws in the movie version. This film is so different from other parts, so much better, so huge. Firstly, it was the first time that everything was outside Hogwarts, there were overwhelming moments. People tend to call these later parts Dark, which is very shallow of them. I mean of'course, it has to be dark; thats what the book is all about. Its Dark, its tough, its everything that the last one should have been and the first part of the Deathly Hallows turned out to be the same for the movie series. David Yates has been phenomenal in directing the last 3 movies, i so desperately wanna watch the last part now, i mean there is so much more to come, it will be so much better. Watching the movie was like living in it, living each and every moment of it, just like it was while reading the last book. Daniel Radcliffe was his best, Emma Watson was so graceful and brisk at the same time, Rupert Grint was good, all 3 looked so good together. Harry and Ginnie's relationship also matured but the chemistry wasn't as good as Ron and Hermionie's. Billy brought his charm, shame that there wasn't anything more left for him. I will definitely watch it again.",1
746,,"I went to see it with my expectation very high and I was afraid that the movie would not fill my expectations. But to my surprise, it has meet my expectations and it has been better that what I thought. The movie is highly entertaining, there are many action scenes. Also there are some scenes that are slow-paced but they are not boring at all. This scenes are very interesting because it shows a new part of the characters that was never shown before. The visual effects are stuning and the movie has everything: drama, lots of action, horror and comedy. I really liked the end of the movie it left everyone in suspense. This is by far the best harry potter movie yet and I am waiting anxiously for part 2. Everything in the movie was perfect: the acting, the scenery, the visual effects, the script, the cinematography, EVERYTHING!!! I have just arrived to my house after seeing the movie and I am already waiting to see it again tomorrow and again and again on other days. I highly recommend it and I encourage people to go to the cinemas and to watch a PERFECT MOVIE!!!",1
747,10.0,First i feared movie will fail to the expectations of readers. But It was wise decision to split the movie as in past in 5th and 6th movie story part was neglected due to length.,1
748,9.0,"In some ways it is always tough as a filmmaker to watch the Harry Potter movies when they first come out. As a writer/director and avid fan of the books, I already have preconceived notions in regards as to how I would film certain scenes, as to how I would write certain scenes, and as to what I would cut or accentuate to make the story a cinematic reality. I didn't get to direct this movie (which that would have been a dream come true), but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a cinematically satisfying experience on its own terms.",1
749,9.0,"After watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows yesterday, 'pleasantly surprised' would be an understatement. I went in expecting it to be as poor as the Half-Blood Prince (missing and altering key information, butchering Dumbledore's death, etc.) and as a Potterhaed, I appreciate that I am very hard to please but this just makes the fact that I give this film 9 an even greater achievement for David Yates (who I feel ruined the previous film). The film has many touching scenes with adrenalin-pumping action and comedy as well. For example, when Hermione (Emma Watson) is tortured, her piercing screams seem to rip through the viewer's heart as well. It was an outstanding display of her acting ability. There was also the dance scene between Harry and Hermione which didn't feature in the book so it feels somewhat awkward for big Potter fans but in terms of film-making, it's outstanding. By using this dance, Yates almost seems to clear the air between Harry and Hermione, passing unspoken words between them but it also makes it clear that they don't feel 'that way' about each other. The scene in Godric's Hollow is also very good. It doesn't quite paint the picture of warmth that's in the book but prefers to seem more cold and distant which slightly reduces the shock a few minutes later. The chase through the sky (and road) at the start is truly exhilarating on the big screen and you truly feel how hectic it is. I don't wish to 'spell' the whole film out to you but these scenes aren't even necessarily the best ones.",1
750,9.0,"To write a review about Harry Potter is risky, as if you critic it too much then you may have the whole of the British public on your back. For years the books and films have been adopted by the British as something to be proud of, the franchise being added to the likes of fish and chips and Eastenders. Happily after watching the film I found myself relieved, as it lived up to the hype that has surrounded it for the past weeks. The last book in the series, 'The Deathly Hallows', was widely regarded as the best. It was also seen as one of the longest and most action packed. The decision was therefore made to split the film into two parts, rather than have the final memory of Harry Potter being that it was rushed. But what a decision that was, the first part left viewers drooling at the prospect of another instalment. The Deathly Hallows: Part one does not let down its true fans or the casual cinema goer, an achievement of huge proportions. To satisfy the taste of both the general public and the Potter fanatics shows that David Yates has done his job perfectly. He stuck to the book as a guide, making sure he satisfied the desires of the old fans, as well as adding enough action and drama so that any age can pop in and enjoy the experience. Personally the film has re-ignited my passion for Potter, bringing back memories of the books and of the range of emotions the series makes you feel. Sitting in the cinema and looking around at the people aged from 18 to what I'm sure was a woman in her late 70's, you could tell that to some it was just a film. But to others, it was a lot more. It was the start of the end, an ending to a series which has encapsulated the imaginations of a nation. I can almost guarantee that 90% of people in that cinema will be buying another ticket when part two hits cinema's in 2011. I think that is the most impressive thing about The Deathly Hallows: Part one. It doesn't matter who you are or how involved you are in the series, chances are you will end up watching it at some point. (Or being surrounded by people that have, and ending up knowing the storyline anyway).",1
751,10.0,"First of all, i want to say that the critics don't like it mainly because this movie WAS NOT MADE FOR THEM, it was made for US HARDCORE/BOOK FANS, whoever didn't like this movie either didn't read the book *cough*critics*cough*, or are asking for way too much from WB. Now, Wow I can not begin to explain how proud and happy and relieved i am of the entire cast and crew of this movie! This movie was PERFECTION! PERFECT SCRIPT, PERFECT ACTING, PERFECT DIRECTION ( could've been better in some parts but i'm not complaining) The thing that struck me the most was the acting, it just BLEW ME AWAY, especially Emma Watson. This girl absolutely outdid herself and i for one feel that she deserves some kind of award or recognition for this, i really really think so! Hermione's character stood out MILESSSS away from the others - Ron as well, with Rupert's always perfect performance- her emotional depth and finally getting into Hermione's SKIN is just perfect, it's the Hermione we've all been waiting for. The adaptation is also perfect, or the CLOSEST thing to perfect, from all the movies in the series, HANDS DOWN. It put full exact scenes from the book, with almost the exact same dialog, some of them i even mouthed them while hearing them, it's a huge shocker, a huge pleasant surprise, and i can NOT wait to watch this and the next one back to back!",1
752,7.0,"To begin I have not followed with the series of Harry Potter movies that have come out since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" in 2001, but I was fascinated with this newest edition to the series ""The Deathly Hallows"" mostly from what others had been saying and the idea that the film would be split into two parts. So after deliberation, I went and saw the movie. To be fair, I did enjoy the film, from start to finish I was intrigued by the events that transgressed and began to get an understanding of the characters. I was a little slow in understanding the plot of the movie but gradually got a small idea as to what was happening. The actors all do a fair job with their roles and character development was one of those moments where the writing truly impressed me. The foreboding scenery and visuals aided to enhance the seemingly hopeless plight of the characters and some of the dialogue further added to the mood of the film. However, I do have to say that the film really isn't the same for one who first comes into the series. One really must have seen some of the other films to truly grasp what's going on in this one. There were times when I thought that I knew what was happening in the story but then quickly began to question myself after something else happened. Sometimes I couldn't really understand the dialogue and that left me feeling a little confused, which persisted throughout the film. In conclusion I have to say that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" while entertaining, was just alright to me. For those who have seen the other movies might think that this movie is great, but I just didn't get that same feeling. However, I will say that the film did get me interested in the series just from seeing this film and I can safely say that I am looking forward to seeing part 2.",1
753,8.0,"The beginning of the end and what a beginning! Not only has this film got suspense it has a truck full of humour which lightens the whole film up. With this film the sad bits make you cry, the funny bits make you laugh and the scary bits make you jump.",1
754,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is absolutely spellbinding; a full-blown fantasy epic with the magic, heart, and characters we have come to love over the last decade's worth of Harry Potter films. However it is a different world. For our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer bound to the safe haven Hogwarts once provided, but are on the run, trying to find the Horcruxes to defeat Voldemort.",1
755,,"This movie was really well done. I loved the editing, the music, the acting, the costumes, and set pieces. I would highly recommend this movie. The ending was really sad and dramatic. The script was really well done. the director was excellent. Helena Bonham Carter was the best. Emma Watson did a fantastic job. The pace of the movie was not too rushed. They adapted the book very well. It's to his great credit that Yates can keep these slow-paced scenes captivating and then easily switch to the comfort of a well-timed joke or intense action scene. Despite an emphasis on these characters being lost, both directionally and spiritually, Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 1 is still a movie that knows how to have fun. It just always mixes in the thrills with the sorrow. You can have a high-speed broom chase, but not everyone will make it out unscathed. You can have a funny and thrilling heist scene, but there will be the undertones of Nazi Germany. It's a movie where a scene can begin with someone getting flushed down a toilet and end with a critical injury and yet somehow it all works.",1

758,8.0,"This is a very good movie and I'm not really a good fan of Harry potter, but in this movie the directors capture my attention with amazing special effects. Also the history has a lot of comic scenes and then BAM an action Scene. So I recommended this movie. Also the effects in 3D are very good. The directors make an excellent decision to divide this movie in two parts because in the end you will want to see the final part. Actually I have to see the other harry potter movies because I don't remember a lot of details of the history, so I have to spend some time to see them.

This is my personal favorite Potter movie ever, It has the best acting yet and very amazing special effects. The actors are amazingly great and very well cast but have been from the beginning. This part of the series has just the right balance of effects and normal movie acting. Radcliffe has done an excellent job of being harry and always has but it is shown greatly in this movie. Watson is a very great actor and does an amazing job with this film. Grint has always been a good actor throughout all of the movies in this one though he does a superb job of portraying the character well.",1

Then I realized the story was left out.

The book itself is the story why do they have to leave things out? ",1

The only one that follows the book better is the first one and thats the only because it is short and has the least amount of important details. This one includes everything you need to know, and they end it at a great part. some people don't like where it ended but I love it because it leaves you thinking. The only part i don't like is the way they portrayed Dobby dropping down the chandelier at Malfoy Manner. in the book he uses magic to to do it, but in the movie he unscrews it and it just makes it weird after reading the book like 21 times one way and then seeing the movie another way. But over all its a great movie and I really recommend it.",1

'There will always be a next one'. Nope. The reason we will all feel different in the cinema on July 15, is because this is the last one.

771,9.0,"Okay, so after reading some of the reviews here, I have a couple of responses before getting to my review of the film. First of all, David Yates is a director, not a screenwriter. I'm sure he's included in the process, but people need to stop blaming him for the random things thrown into the movies (Bellatrix setting the Burrow on fire in Half-Blood Prince, for example). His job is to direct the actors, not write the screenplay. Leave him alone. Second of all, J.K. Rowling has been part of the process since they started making the films, and she's been happy with every adaptation. If it's good enough for her, it should be good enough for the rest of you since she wrote the whole series.",0
772,9.0,"I was definitely surprised. It really got that darker tone as it was supposed to get. It stuck well to the book and as a fan I really appreciated it since the Half-Blood Prince wasn't that good. It was really exciting, building up to part 2 amazingly. The acting was excellent and the screenplay was well adapted. The visual effects were amazing as always, adding to the magic and the dramatic Harry-Voldemort fight scene. The only thing that bothered me was the beginning of the movie. Dudley's and Harry's heartfelt goodbye was not included which I was very sad about since it's their final goodbye and peace offering in the books.",1

774,5.0,"Having just seen this movie yesterday (05/12/2010), I can honestly say that it was exactly what I expected it to be, except for its darkness. Compare this to the first movie in the series and there are more similarities to Star Wars than Harry Potter! I think JKR is trying to get us to leave the theatre in a cloud of doom and depression, as it is so dark. Having watched all the movies to date, I felt like most people that I had better watch them to the end. I wish I hadn't bothered. Don't get me wrong though, these are good movies all of them. But they are so unlike each other, I don't remember my five years in high school being so different every year in succession. They should be seen as seven, (sorry, eight!) different movies and not a series. The worst part of all of this though is that yesterday I paid the full price at the theatre to watch half a movie. Oh I know Warner Bros is suffering as there are only a finite number of HP movies, but I am not a rich man and nowhere near as rich as anyone who has anything to do with this movie! Making it in two parts, no let me rephrase that, making it in ONE part and splitting that into two and charging two fees for one movie is a big con, the book wasn't anywhere near as big as 'The Order of the Phoenix' so there is no need to split it up. Even my partner felt that a lot of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor as it just dragged on and on. Now of course this will become a new thing, I have heard that there are other big movies to be made in one part yet split into two. Come on Hollywood! I want to support you by visiting the cinema and buying genuine Blu-ray Discs, but I am not like yourselves, made of money!",0
