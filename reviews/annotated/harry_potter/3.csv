0,6.0,"Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.",1
1,9.0,"''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is the best of all Harry Potter movies of all(at least until now),and also the only one that I gave a vote bigger then 7. As all my Harry Potter comments, I need to say again that the book is so much better and has much more details who are important in the series, but this is the first of all movies who really deserve my applause. The effects are better, the cast looks more comfortable in their respective roles and even being a summary of the books,''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' finally was a good movie. Of course that since the fourth book is very big, many, MANY parts are not showed in the movie,including details about the relationship between Cedric and Harry and also when Harry was in the Quidditch World Cup.",1
2,8.0,"I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox",1
3,8.0,It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.,0
4,6.0,"While Prisoner was a step forward I alway felt like the film adaptation of Goblet was a step back simply due to time. Goblet really should be longer to cover all the stuff going on here. Yes, we have the games but in order to do that right the whole movie has to be about that. There's not enough time to explore all the other stuff going on here, the relationships shifting and adapting, the mystery of what's going on. None of this feels more epitomized than in the relationship of Ron and Harry. Best buddies up until now and yet, suddenly they're fed up with each other. I understand the reasoning of it all but it doesn't feel like the film is allowed to live in that enough to make the reactions feel reasonable or earned.",0

6,8.0,"This fourth installment of J.K. Rowling saga , once again our friends Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) , Ron (Rupert Grint) , Hermione (Emma Watson) are at Hogwar school and their enemies Braco Malfoy (Tom Felton) , his father (Jason Isaacs) along the dark forces , the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemor . Besides , appearing the ordinary teachers , such as : Minerva (Maggie Smith) , Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) , Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) , along with a meddler journalist (Miranda Richardson) , Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) , a new rare professor (Bernard Gleeson) , and , of course , Rubeus (Robbie Coltrane) .

7,6.0,"Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.",0

9,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.",1
10,9.0,"Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.",0
11,4.0,"I have to say, I'm really disappointed in how this film turned out, especially in comparison with how great the book is. In my humble opinion, studios have to face up to the fact that two and a half hours is no longer sufficient to capture the scope and power of J.K. Rowling's universe.",0
12,8.0,"I'd hate to face the task of condensing a 700 page book into a movie - even a two and a half hour movie, but they've managed pretty well with this installment of the adventures of Harry Potter.",0
13,1.0,"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie and the part that's really wrong are the characters. 1000 words aren't enough to explain everything so I'll have to be brief. The worst character is Dumbledore. What version of him Kloves & Newell see I have no idea.. I mean, have they read the books at all? Would Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards alive manhandle one of his own students, especially his favorite student? I should think not. Would he use Harry as bait to lure Voldemort out of hiding? Same answer as above, NO. Gambon can't play him to save his life, Richard Harris could, he had the twinkle in his eyes... something that makes Dumbledore so special. Gambon just comes off as a lunatic.",0
14,7.0,"First of all, I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book, and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get, but they were entirely unexpected.",1
15,8.0,"As a huge fan of the books, we have to keep this in context. This is a movie, there is no way it could have included all of the book. I use the movies as fillers between the books, entertaining, but just fillers. That said, there were some glaring omissions that are vital to the next book. Why did Mike Newell extend the dragon scene, but leave out key characters? - because mistakenly Hollywood thinks that such exciting CGI is more important to the fans of the books than expanding characters and plot details. Wrong. But we will go and see the movie anyway.",0
16,6.0,"-=-=-=-SUMMARY: The movie leaves a lot to be desired. It nails its dark ending, but the rest of the film is disjointed and without substance. Why? It puts a little of everything in, rather than a lot of a few things. ""Star"" characters Krum, Fleur, Cedric, and Cho get the shaft in a big way -- but at least it looks pretty?-=-=-=-",0
17,5.0,"My girlfriend is a huge Harry Potter fan, so she eventually roped me into watching this cinematic train wreck.",0
18,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a film directed by Mike Newell. With every instalment of the series, my anticipation for the film also increased. And I can say even with the fourth instalment, the excitement is never reduced.",0
19,1.0,"The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly, if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book, but only seen the previous two movies, s/he would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot, but rather the rather single-minded story of the three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one-dimensional, which is unfortunate; even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy, no magical lessons, and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared, but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious: Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body, but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map, no late-night encounters with Moody, no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship, nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series, I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics, such as a hedge maze without any traps, only shifting walls and evil roots, an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball, and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old, bumbling fool, rather than the clever, most-powerful-wizard on the planet, the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams, completely removed the second house-elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup, and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban, but never explained his escape. Finally, the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch, Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims, and the potential for an amazing cliff-hanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle, was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps, and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot, one did not become attached to the characters, and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good, but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie.",0
20,3.0,"First, the good news -- The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done. ",1
21,7.0,"First, a confession: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a Potter fan, so I felt something of a fraud as I sneaked into a media screening of Goblet of Fire while many bona fide devotees have had to wait it out.",0
22,8.0,"the fourth Harry-Potter-film (and the first to be directed by an Englishman) is a fun ride. Not for the youngest fans, perhaps, because like Rowling's novel it marks the point where Harry's story transforms from a children's tale into darker, maturer fantasy. In this sequel, Harry's arch-enemy Voldemort rises again and, as the movie's tag-line has it, ""dark and dangerous times lie ahead."" ",1
23,5.0,"I found this installment of the Potter series hard to follow, and frankly, dull and boring. The ""extra"" characters from other schools dilute the ""feel"" of the film. It departs too far from the magic as it pertains to Harry Potter's life and destiny, and relies too much on special effects.",0
24,10.0,I had the privilege of seeing the newest addition to the Harry Potter movies last night. I must say it was an awesome movie. Definitely the best of the Harry Potter movies so far.,1
25,4.0,"The fourth book in the HARRY POTTER series is by far the best, offering up a ton of adventure, excitement, danger, death, and heartfelt emotion and easily surpassing the previous three entries because of its darker, more epic feel. Sadly, GOBLET OF FIRE the movie is a real disappointment, a film that goes through the motions without offering any real heart to the proceedings.",0
26,4.0,"Both of us agreed, the Goblet of Fire was a soulless, mechanical, disappointment. The latest Potter movie has no humor, no wit, and substitutes frenetic action for plot and dialogue. The characters seem made of cardboard, being moved about by the director to advance the plot. There is none of the subtlety, or wit of the first movie. None of the character development and advancing friendship between the main characters of the second movie. As the Potter movies advance, they have steadily deteriorated. These movies now absolutely are not for children under 16 and are largely a waste of time. Special effects do not make the movie any more. We give the Goblet of Fire two thumbs down for sloppy script, lack of intelligence and substitution of mishmash for coherence.",0
27,3.0,"I know I'm going to make loads of enemies by saying this but I just don't see why everyone is going nuts over this film. There are billions of biased Harry Potter lunatics out there who would give this film 10/10 before even seeing it, even if the director did nothing but wipe his ass on the celluloid. That isn't the case, but it's still one of the most boring films I've had to sit through in a long time.",0
28,,"So this is the new, long awaited Harry Potter, the adaptation of the fourth part of the legendary magical book series. I've been waiting for this movie for, let's say a year now. And from what I've heard, seen in the trailer and the MTV Making of I was optimistic. Even more so because Mike Newell directed the film who also did one of my favourite films, ""Four weddings and a funeral"". And yes, I had high expectations. ",1
29,2.0,"Ever seen those companion books for kids that come out around the same time as a movie? They are mostly filled with big pictures and little explanation about what actually happens in the film. Goblet of Fire is basically the same thing - only opposite. It is a picture-book-type movie that has been made as a companion to a book already released. It offers no explanation to the plot (rarely even provides a plot), and is filled with lots of big pictures that only make sense if you have read the book.",0
30,5.0,"I went to see this movie this afternoon and to be honest i was expecting disappointment as happened with the other three potter movies but i wasn't quite expecting what i saw. I am a lover of the books and have read them all many (10+) times (ex HBP) and hate it when important bits of the plot are cut. I think in terms of effects and general film making the film was good, the acting from the majority of the cast was also excellent, however i feel that the movie moved too fast and didn't really explain what was going on. If you've seen the trailer you have pretty much seen the movie. Much of the Plot involving Rita skeeter was cut (i think we only saw her twice) which i find very disappointing as it sets up the fifth book and the ""harry is crazy, look at what was said about him in the prophet last year"" plot. One surprise for me though was Mad-eye-moody, after seeing the trailers and photos i was dreading him being played as a joke character with his mad eye but i was very impressed with his character and performance although i did notice the lack of CONSTANT VILIGANCE. Overall i think this movie could be used as a 'look what i can do with my computer' movie. In my opinion if you want a good plot and more than one comprehenseable storyline you should go read the book.",1
31,7.0,"I must say I am extremely sick of this movie, though not for conventional reasons. Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.",0
32,1.0,"I absolutely HATED this movie. As a movie that is supposed to not have anything to do with the great book that is attached to it, it is entertaining, but because it carries the ""Harry Potter"" emblem to it, I will scrutinize it to the very last detail that bothered me.",0
33,3.0,"This film was directed by Mike Newell, of Four Wedding's and a Funeral (1994), and Pushing Tin (1999) fame. Here we see his interpretation of J.K. Rowling's novel The Goblet of Fire. His career mainly consists of T.V. Direction, since 1964, and a smattering of movies. ",0
34,2.0,"The only thing that was in common between the film and the book was the characters names!!!! I appeciate the fact that the book is indeed rather long and showing its entirety in the film would be impossible; but it feels as if someone has simple read every other chapter and made the film; this film should have been another hour longer!! The beginning of the book has simply been removed from the book and we start about one fifth of the way in, so those who have read the book will be annoyed from the start. Out of all of the Potter books the goblet of fire was by FAR my favourite, and from what I have read, the favourite of most, and so I had high expectations from the film, and was castastrophical disappointed. I went to see the film which some girls who had never read the books and they thoroughly enjoyed the film, as did the small children who were in the cinema. Credit were it is due though, the special effects are better than the previous films, and generally the acting has indeed improved, and for this reason I have not given the film a 1 rating, though I was tempted.",0
35,3.0,"I can't help, but to compare the Harry Potter movie to the books. If you want to re-write the books don't call them ""Harry Potter"" anymore.",0
36,10.0,This is a awesome Harry Potter Movie It is really pretty well done with a dark and spooky feel It almost made me wet my pants and I'm 28 years old. Yeah there is some stuff left out that was in the book but there is plenty of action and effects. Its a must see for all fans of the books and movies. This movie is the best of the series to date. I can't wait for the DVD to find out if there's anything added that was left out of the film. This movie is best on the big screen. The young actors are growing up well. I'm afraid that pretty soon they will be too old for there roles in the film. I know some people probably won't like this film too much and its not for the really young kids but Its a great film and I would not miss it for the world.,1
37,4.0,"Before I hear the ""You can't expect it to follow the books"", the people who seem so firmly set on this was a good movie, best yet, and that it did the book justice I have to ask why.",1
38,7.0,"Goblet of Fire is of course, well done and beautifully shot. Not having read any of the Potter series, I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all. From what I have heard, many underlying plots and characters may have been skipped to streamline the movie and keep its focus, so the readers might be disappointed, I don't know. ""Fire"" is darker than the rest of the movies. Seemed to lack some of the humor that gave the previous films some levity. Great storyline, fabulous effects. LONG though. It's about 2.5 hours long, so make time for it. It's worth it to watch and goes quickly. Throughly enjoyed it, but not my favorite of the bunch so far.",1
39,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film of the first four. The tone is darker, the acting is better, and so much more. There is only a small minimal problem that is no surprise. This time around, Harry enters his fourth year at Hogwarts. His name got entered into the Triwizard Tournament and he must compete. Little did he know that the tournament will lead to eventual trouble with a wizard who been gone for thirteen years. The acting is better in this film. Radcliffe is more appealing as Harry. Watson overacts a bit too much, but she did OK. The supporting actors like Gambon and Rickman are fantastic. I also liked the music in this film. It has a nice sound to it. The only problem is that some subplots were left out. I wished to see the Dursley's, Dobby and Winky, Charlie and Bill, the visits to Hogsmeade and Sirius, and the midnight argument with Moddy and Snape. Other than that, this film is sooooo much better than any of the other films. If I could, I would rate this film a 15/10, but I rate it a 10/10.",1
40,,"During the previous three Harry Potter films, a showdown between Harry Potter & Dark Lord Voldemort was always hinted at but never quite fully conceived. In ""Goblet of Fire"", however, that confrontation does indeed finally take place and vaults the series to new heights.",1
41,1.0,"I was unhappy with movie III. I am aghast at this movie. Where to start? The beginning is usually a good place. Choppy. This movie was even choppier than the first one. It starts appropriately with the dream (of course the dream is not accurate to the book), but Harry is already at the Burrow. I guess there wasn't enough money in the budget to pay for Molly, Bill, or Charlie since none of them are in the film. Same goes for a little Quidditch, there isn't any. How can there be a Quidditch World Cup and no Quidditch? Ludo Bagman, where is he? Bagman is essential to the twins money sub plot. Money for the twins, how are they supposed to leave school toward the end of the next movie with no money (There was no mention of a monetary prize for the winner of the tournament)? How is Harry supposed to get any information any more, Sirius kept Hedwig? Then again Sirius must not be too important since they couldn't even do the fireplace scene appropriately and didn't have him, not even as a large, black dog at the end of the film. Then again Harry never went to the hospital. Fudge and Dumbledore do not have a parting of ways. I just wonder if Steven Kloves even bothered to read book 5 or discuss it with J.K. Rowling before butchering the screenplay for this movie. I just can't see how there can be an Order of the Phoenix that makes any sense when all of the set up was cut from the fourth movie. I know they can't have everything in the book in the movie but the overall story arc has to be maintained. I wonder what J.K. Rowling truly thinks of this film. I know two things for sure, I want Chris Columbus back directing 6 and 7 and I want Peter O'Toole for Dumbledore.",0

43,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is hands down the most fun and entertaining movie of the series in between the beginning and end. It's cool because it's kind of it's own stand alone film within a film within a series. It has plenty of magical ties to the books and the Harry Potter universe. You also see brand new characters introduced who only continue to improve and shape the series. Finally, I loved that it continued to intensify and evolve the series story line to make it much more dark and sinister. It's no longer just a kids series, rather one for any type of audience. Absolutely fun and great movie.",1
44,6.0,"The only experience I have had with Harry Potter is the first film. My spouse reads the books fanatically and sporadically sees the films. A number of my friends also do both. I've not read the books and not really kept up with all the movies, but I can say that I really enjoyed this film. Like the first, it was well made, intelligent, and visually interesting. Nevertheless, don't expect to get it all if you haven't kept up with the books, and if you have, don't expect to be given it all. Movies can not be as rich as books - especially lengthy and well written ones.",1
45,1.0,"I've never read the books, and they may very well stimulate the imaginations of children all over the world. That's commendable. BUT as a movie series, these movies have been mediocre at best. This latest movie, Goblet Of Fire, is the worst yet. It's slow paced, the characters are either not interesting or completely annoying, and the movie is so dark that it's impossible to see things sometime. The biggest problem I have is not with the film itself, but with the actors' thick accents, quick speech patterns, and tendency to whisper, it's impossible to understand what they are saying half the time. The movie does have some noteworthy sequences though. Harry's face off with a dragon is very exciting. An underwater rescue is also very good, with some amazing special effects. A sequence involving a huge hedge maze that makes the maze in the Shining look like child's play, is exciting, but possibly way too scary and violent for young kids. It's rated PG-13 for a reason. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, but I gave the movie a chance because my kids wanted to see it, and I was very interested in seeing the Superman Returns preview they were going to show before the movie (and that looks INCREDIBLE). But neither I nor my children were at all impressed. For our money....ZATHURA was FAR superior. Stick to the books kids, I'm sure they are far better than this drivel.",0

Easily one of the better books of the entire series by JK Rowling (including books 5 and 6), the darker and scarier take on the story was welcomed by fans of the films and the books everywhere as Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco) attempts to attach his name to an ever-growing franchise.

I'm a huge fan of the books, and highly recommend them to anyone who loves to watch a character grow through a series of novels. I have to write, first of all, that I miss Columbus as the director. His vision of Harry's world was beautiful. And that's probably the main issue with why Warner Brothers went with another director for these ""darker"" movies further on in the Harry Potter series. I also understand that Rowling really enjoyed how the director Newell crafted this movie, and agreed with what he had to cut out.",1
52,7.0,I thought the movie was great. But there are a few things missing that were in the book. If you haven't seen the movie I advise you not to read this. For example Dobbi and Winky were not even mentioned and they were in the book quite a bit. Also Syreus was only in the movie for about 1 minute and that was very disappointing. There were so many differences from book to movie that I can't possibly name them all. My advice is to see the movie before you read the book so you don't feel disappointed. I went into the theater really looking forward to a few particular things that were in the book. And when they weren't shown I remember thinking who the heck wrote the screen play.,0

54,4.0,"I have to say that I disagree with almost every review posted here. I traveled for an hour to see the movie at midnight, for the first showing. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film. How disappointed I was. I must say that I think that the fourth book is perhaps the weakest in the series, but it is still a good read. The movie, however, was by far the worst yet. So many important details were left out, the movie raced along trying to fit as much plot into two and a half hours as possible. Of course there was excitement, funny moments,and talented acting. But overall, the plot moved so quickly, that one barely felt any connection to the characters involved other than what has been built up from the last three movies and the book. The Yule Ball was ridiculous, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was overly dramatic. The challenges in the Tri-Wizard Tournament were rushed through and the other competitors characters were not built up. You barely know, yet alone feel anything about Viktor Krum, Fleur, or even Cedric Diggory. The special effects were great, but could not make up for the loss of the ""magic"" felt in the books and other movies. The final scene with Voldemort was well-done. Scary, suspenseful, exciting.

I really, honestly do not know what to say about this film. It's beautifully made, yes. The acting is much improved, yes. But the unbelievable liberties that were taken - what are you meant to say about that? From the off, Harry's dream about Voldemort etc is horribly altered by adding an unrelated character - it may not seem that important, but it is. And Dumbledore - I think Michael Gambon is an exemplary actor, but to see Dumbledore lose it with Harry in such an uncharacteristic way was dumbfounding.",1
56,10.0,Now that the other BIG fantasy series has finished (Lord Of The Rings) with 3 films.It was time to see if Harry Potter could carry on past 3 films and get closer to the number the books are going to finish on (the books are meant to finish by book 7). The Plot:,1
57,9.0,"Coming at the exact center of a seven-book series, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" represents a turning point for both its hero and Rowling's writing in general. Harry's youthful innocence is replaced by the moody complexities of adolescence, even as his arch-nemesis Lord Voldemort transforms from a vague, shadowy threat to a very real evil presence in the wizarding world. The moral issues hinted at in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" become even more prominent: good people die, heroes are flawed, and even the saintly Dumbledore proves to be only human. The film version of ""Goblet of Fire"" reflects this, and, like all movies that capture the essence of its source material, is a delight to behold.",1
58,8.0,"This is my favorite of the four movies so far. The pace is brisk and keeps the action moving along nicely. Thank God the director realized that we don't need so much unnecessary exposition. Although that stuff might work in the book, for a movie, it just sets it up to be long and boring. It's already assumed that we know who Voldemort is, that they live in a magical place, that the students go to class. There is little time spent on whimsy and the wonders of the magical world. There isn't even a scene with the Dursleys. And that's perfectly fine. You shouldn't be watching this movie if you haven't seen the previous ones. Whatever exposition is given, is for anything we don't know about and the plot itself.",1

No offense to the other books before as they were great too, but this is the story were its not so childish and the characters are becoming more mature and serious about their futures. the movie does a great job on its special effects, acting, and all together the direction movie went. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat with all the action, suspense(the dragon scene were especially good), and drama.If your a fan of the books, then I highly suggest that you go see it.",1
62,7.0,"This just goes to show that these films are merely based!!! on the brilliant series that is the Harry Potter books. Again Fair play to the actors, they have matured and acted better than ever in this film and i thoroughly enjoyed Rupert Grints portrayal of Ron, for me it was him who somehow kept me in the cinema and reminded me of some of the brilliant scenes in the book. The first problem with this film is that almost the whole film is dark and disturbing, like the last half hour of the prisoner of Azkaban. there are hardly any light fun moments, any that were, were cut from the film. for example, Dudley's huge tongue after eating Fred and George's sweet prototypes for their future joke shop.",1
63,8.0,"Easily the best and the funniest in the Harry Potter series, this film really is brilliant! What makes it as well is its intensity. The danger factor has been enhanced from the book considerably, as evident in Harry's battle with his dragon during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. The book merely has Harry riding around a bit to avoid the dragon but the film has the dragon breaking it's restraints and following Harry around the school's turrets in an attempt to roast him alive. The action is definitely better with the special effects used in the telling of the story rather than overused.",1

I knew from the very first instant of this film that it would be outstanding in every way. As opposed to the kid-friendly, John Williams tinker-bell score that sounds so similar to ""Somewhere in My Memory"" the movie begins with a much darker variation on the Harry Potter theme. The opening shot follows a snake to the crypt of the Riddle family and a statue that looks ominously like a Death Eater. I adore this first shot so much because it lets the viewer know that right away this film is going to be a lean, mean thriller. And thankfully, the opening scene of Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew, from here on known as Wormtail, and Barty Crouch Junior, immediately immerses you in the ""magical world"" as opposed to the ""real world"" of Harry's dreadful relatives, the Dursleys. Thankfully, the Dursleys are absent from the beginning of this film, and the story begins with Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys journeying to the Quidditch World Cup. Right away we realize that that opening scene was just a dream, a dream sequence that would become a dramatic motif throughout the rest of the film that often unifies disparate elements into a thriller format.",1

Yes, there are far too many characters, probably more so than in the first three films, and of necessity most of them, especially those introduced here for the first time, have little or no dialog and are not fleshed out. Also, Hermione and Ron are more relegated to supporting characters than before. Still, the movie works on a number of levels, as pure adventure, suspense, and with a couple generous dollops of horror.",1

The music was OK (although Patrick Doyle used a lot of violins) and the Mcbeth sisters were excellent! Of my part I think that this is the best of Newell (Mona Lisa smile was boring!!!)and I hope him to direct another Potter movie. My rate is 10/10, i'm glad to say that it deserved it :).",1

The book was fine, and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story, only trim it down for runtime.",0
76,1.0,"A fabulous film -- if you haven't read the books. Really exciting, and nothing left out -- if you haven't read the books. However, if you have read the books, it is a complete and utter disappointment. I went into the theater thinking, 'This shouldn't be too bad,' but, after seeing what they did to Mad-Eye Moody (i.e. the HUGE BLACK STRAP) I wasn't all that thrilled. Dumbledore - completely out of character. During one scene, he actually shakes Harry and yells in others. The Albus Dumbledore of the books is a wise, calm old man, not a raging but clueless crackpot. Many things are left unexplained; such as Neville's fear of the Cruciatus (sp?) curse, and what exactly happens to Barty Crouch (senior). Of course, if you have read the book, you know exactly what is going on, but as an innocent movie-goer who has never even glanced in the books, you are left wondering. And as Emma Watson already being quite pretty, the supposed transformation when she appears at the Yule Ball is muted and almost nonexistent; it simply that she put her hair up. All house-elves are not mentioned at all. S.P.E.W. is gone (though, despite it being a interesting subject in the book, it wasn't particularly important to the story). And it is Neville who gives Harry the gillyweed, instead of Dobby. Of course, that still works quite well, as Neville is so good at Herbology. But, did anyone think that Voldemort was far too jolly? Or is that just me? 'Oh, Harry, I'd almost forgotten you were there!' Can you honestly picture that coming from the great Dark Lord's mouth? There were many other examples during that scene; it was extremely annoying. As for the Dark Mark appearing in the sky, it comes too late. The tents are set on fire (where are the people suspended in the sky?) and everyone is running. Yes, that's reason to be scared, but surely the Dark Mark appearing is far better. So, after everyone has left, who should come along but Barty Crouch Jr. Then he fires the Dark Mark into the sky, and the producer thinks, 'Oh, good. We've got that in the story; people shouldn't complain.' Nope; wrong. He fires it a bit too late. After EVERYONE has left he brings out what should have started the terror. How stupid. (And it was also disappointing when they only made one comment that might suggest who won the World Cup. I'm Irish; I would have been very pleased if they had made that a bit more apparent. While we're on the subject of Barty Crouch Jr., I will bring up that his character totally changed. Instead of being this sniveling, scared young man who calls out to his father in desperation only to have Barty (senior) say, ""You're no son of mine,"" we have him as a weird, explosive monster who comes up and licks his lips at his dad and is all, ""Nyehehehe. Hello, Father."" The 'son of mine' line only works if you make Barty (Jr.) a proper, terrified, misunderstood boy. And Sirius. Gary Oldman makes no actual appearance; how do we even know that it was him who was talking to Harry? And that was done horribly. Instead of Sirius's head appearing in the flames, we have a grotesque thing (that did not look anything like Sirius) popping out of the embers. And also, when Harry sends off his letter to Sirius at the beginning, it is clearly marked on the front to go to Sirius Black. But how ridiculous! His letter could have been intercepted, and then everyone would know that Sirius was somewhere nearby, and that someone (if they weren't one of the people who knew either Harry's handwriting or Harry's owl) was in contact with him. But, as for the acting and the special effects, it was all fine.",0

This was a fine movie and all involved with its creation and presentation to the big screen for our enjoyment deserve kudos.

We didn't see David Tennant have his soul sucked which was rubbish, for goodness sake, get it together with amateur acting man!! I wasted my money and I certainly won't be buying this twaddle on DVD.

Harry's dragon scene was added to not like the book the dragon does not land on a roof or chase harry through the country side ...

But The Goblet of Fire takes the series down the drain, completely. In an age where special effects are seen in every second film, i really wanted more in this movie than the special effects. The book had so much more to offer, and in the hands of a better director, this movie would have had so much more to offer. But instead, what the viewer is given is a back of the cover summary of the book. For some stupid reason, the entire World Cup match isn't shown in the movie, and all of a sudden (after some crap at Hogwarts), we have the three stages of the contest with nothing really filling up between each stage. Alright, the one star that i have given is for the climax of the movie, where Voldemort really is well depicted and enacted.

However it has had 3 movies in front of it who have made almost all of the design choices for it. the film future for the potter line is fairly well set in stone. The looks of the sets and costumes will not change in the future which stops this moving from fulfilling its artistic potential, but that is problematic of all book-movie conversations. What is left to be artistic is the directorial view (i.e. camera motions, filters, lighting levels, staging etc.) this film (as well as Prisoner of Azkaban) is darker than the rest, which sets it apart and gives it it's ""unqiue factor,"" that is the element that sets it apart from other films of the same type. most interesting to me is the study one can do in plot line. if you have not yet read the books and you are a artistic individual i would recommend you not read any more books till you have seen the movies of them. to many people this is an unconceivable thought but please listen to my logic. first off i have read the first 3 books and am reading the 4th now. every time you see one of these films there is always going to be someone there who read the book first and these individuals all sing the same chorus of ""they cut so much out!!"" this is true. However if you ask those who have only seen the movies they will say they understand the harry potter plot line. that is because while Rawlings books are very entertaining and have many many side stories and interesting facts about her wizard world, her book s are still largely ""fluff."" and that is why i made my recommendation. you can see these movies make coherent plot lines out of these books and not included every detail. looking in-depth at these changes after you have seen the movie makes both the book and the movie better in my opinion. this study in plot analysis will give you a more keen mind to what makes a story and what doesn't. i encourage everyone to try this, if you still can, and your movie going/book reading experiences will become much more enjoyable.",1

Her 4th book was decent enough but bloated, presenting a challenge to any adaptation, and I can't say this film was completely successful. There are many times where it felt disjointed or rushed. On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes makes for a fierce Lord Voldemort (kudos to the makeup department), and the challenges the adolescent wizards are put through provide a dark contrast to the scenes of teenage awkwardness and the humor the film goes for.

Plus, nothing happened to her at the end. If these movies are to be the standard for Harry Potter movies to come, true fans should be disgusted. Dobby, Winky, Ludo Bagman, Hogwarts classes in general, other students, the Dursleys, Ton-Tongue toffees, all gone.

114,7.0,"While 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' are both generally regarded as good films, ''Empire'' is generally considered to be vastly superior for taking the series in new directions while ''Jedi'' just provided more of the same. I feel that this type of relationship can be applied to this Harry Potter film and the third entry, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. The third film gave a whole new darker and more adult look to the series with a considerable amount of style. This fourth film carries on that style but fails to improve on it; as the director, Mike Newell does not add any touches that are distinctly his own. That's not to say that it is a poor film. It is well made, with excellent makeup, superb interior decoration and special effects that are as impressive as usual, but it is in no way up to the standard of the third film. The new music by Patrick Doyle is quite good also, in the same style as John William's famed composition, but with sensations of its own. The film still does have its flaws, and those who have read the book have also complained about it being the first poor adaptation in the series. It is not too well written either way, with too many love subplots that add up to nothing by the end. The plot also feels rather reduced to just sporting events. Directing-wise, the film often feels too busy, with much of the action looking like it is just for show, and although the cinematography is epic scale and grand, it tends to make the film feel too much like a roller coaster ride. It is yet again reasonably entertaining and engaging to watch, despite its drawbacks and its extreme length. It is full of parts that are amusing and interesting effects. It simply just is not too praiseworthy as a follow-up to the superb 'Harry Potter and the Prison of the Azkaban'.",1

Goblet of Fire is great movie version of the book - sure they've had to chop loads out but it still manages to capture the spirit of the original and bring it vividly to life... For me this is where the Harry Potter films change from spooky children's fiction to supernatural adult fiction based in a children's world.

Mike Newell's hamfisted direction pales in comparison to the nuanced and adult work of Alfonso Cuarón, and Newell's trite work more like the dull and insipid films of series originator Chris Columbus. Michael Gambon looked bored and embarrassed, which at least was better than Daniel Radcliffe or Emma Watson, whose incompetence only becomes more glaring with every passing film. Rupert Glint was upstanding as ever, but was likewise hobbled by an utterly facile, idiotic script. The film is too long to hold even the most ardent fan's attention, but the film's most important failures all center on its relationships with its source text and its audience. As far as the source text is concerned, Rowlings is not a particularly good writer, and fidelity to her text is not an ambition to champion. Many of her scenes are awkward enough in the original, let alone graceful when translated to the screen. Some are outright stupid, retarded, substandard according to any conceivable model of drama or narrative. The audience is another matter. This film simply is not designed for 14 year olds. The film reads younger than the previous two, whereas the entire point behind the series is for the material and the audience to grow together.",0

Though not a literary reference, Harry Potter's emergence is reminiscent of another dark hero in ""Batman Begins"". In that movie, Bruce Wayne's mentor Ducard tells his charge, ""The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act."" Granted aside from both movies being Warner Brothers productions, the analogy is not that far fetched. Director Mike Newell's fourth installment of the Harry Potter saga is the series' darkest and perhaps best. Harry (wonderfully played by Radcliffe) acknowledges and reclaims his greatness albeit reluctantly. He battles great evil and his own fear and insecurities through sheer willthe will to act. The evolving Radcliffe embodies his Harry with the right balance of vulnerability and courage as his character believes the best in others while acknowledging his own demons. Mike Newell masterfully crafts his hero's journey reflecting the great storytelling of author J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore advises young Harry, ""Soon we must face the choice between what is right and what is easy."" ""Harry Potter"" under the guidance of Newell does right.

133,5.0,"'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is a decent film adaption and succeeds in being the best that it can be. The film did leave a lot out, but some of this was not as relevant to the story, and a lot of the details were taken out completely. However, the film does not lose its focus and the audience should be encouraged to read the book to get the extra scenes and information that cannot fit into the film. (I suggest that the book be read anyway, as both the film and the book compliment each other.) 'Goblet of Fire' is not my favourite Harry Potter story. It is one of the darkest stories, but the book seems to lose itself in an over-indulgence of events. The film avoids this and keeps a better focus, in my opinion. Horomones play a major part of the story as well. The main events were the three games and the ball. Both the film and the book seem to fail in an overall goal, and there seems to be less direction. It's really just from one game to the next and who can get a date for the ball, and who has a crush on who. It does not make the best Harry Potter story, and I missed the strong relationship between Harry, Hermione, and Ron. And, I did not care for the introduction of the new characters. (Realistic although it is for children to fall out with their friends, I missed the charm of the old novels/films and the adventures that the three main characters got themselves into.) Despite its flaws in a lacking story and some poor acting (disguised by some good special effects and other distractions), the film is worth watching. I'd even say that they've done a pretty good job with the adaption of the script. Not the best, but it's worthwhile.",1

Goblet of Fire is the first Potter movie rated PG-13, to fully embrace its racism metaphors, and to adopt a filmmaking style into its framework. Prisoner of Azkaban was more artistic, but Goblet of Fire absorbed that artistry into the Potterverse structure.

I appreciated the fact that while the prior films had somewhat slow starts, this one skipped over the horrible Dursleys (seriously, WHY do they keep sending Harry back to his abusive relatives?

The whole cast including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are great in their roles. The rest of the talented supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, and Brendan Gleeeson who also turn in admirable performances but they lack screen time only showing up for brief appearances here and there. The pacing was a little slow at times too but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Ralph Fiennes does a decent job with the brief cameo role he has near the end as the evil Lord Voldemort. He's nearly unrecognizable and Fiennes definitely makes for an imposing villain but he like other characters lacks screen time. Besides the pacing the film seems to be juggling too many characters a problem some other movies have had as well (Spider-man 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine to name a few). With it's flaws aside though this Harry Potter is a good film to watch.

The cutting out of lead characters from the original films seemed like a major mistake when I first read it, but ends up being one of the best things about the new Potter film. The lack of the dreaded Dursleys and of Mrs. Weasly only help put us in th mind of Harry Potter as he becomes more of a teenager and less of a child. The only character missing that would help is that of Sirius Black who is you hear narrate a letter and see a computer generated face but is barley in the movie. The acting and direction are both really great the standout performances are by Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody, and there's a major surprise in a great performance by Emma Watson as Hermione who has seemed slightly lost in all the other films and never really worked before. The visual effects are some of the best ever put on film, the only ones that could match it at all are those in The Return of the King, War of the Worlds, and Revenge of the Sith.

After seeing this, though, I see the writers and director do not have the finesse required to make necessary cuts/changes and produce an even mediocre movie. The acting was the least believable that I've seen in a while (and that's including Zorro 2 by the way). No one made a dramatic pause or was able to say even a simple undramatic sentence without some huge physical gesture. Dumbledore's walking around the Goblet of Fire when the champions were announced reminded me of the Ferengi in an early episode of Star Trek the next generation where they were dodging around and growling for no apparent reason. The characters were mutilated beyond recognition (with the possible exception of Harry because they just can't do that), like Dumbledore being more of a hothead and forcing Harry back once his name is called instead of the serene scholar who cares about his students and would never do anything resembling manhandling them. Victor Krum reminded me of the roast ham at Thanksgiving dinner yesterday except the ham was smarter, better looking, and had more lines, a complete contrast from the star of Bulgaria Krum was in the books. I could go much farther in the intense hatred this movie has inspired in me but the box says I have a limit, so I'll wrap it up.

The Quidditch World Cup was glossed over, Winky and Ludo Bagman were eliminated, no SPEW, and the third task was quite different (no sphinx!), but what was there was good (especially the beautiful cinematography).

177,7.0,"There was much to like about this movie, but the thing I must state is that I thought the portrayal of Dumbledore was completely against the character and is irresponsible. He would never lose control like that. If you go back to the book, he uses the same lines with Harry, but he is described as asking them calmly. What is up here? Don't these people read the books? Harris's death was very unfortunate, but for the franchise it's proving deadly. Gambone is so off track that I was offended. I wonder what JK thinks? If I were she, I'd be livid. Too much was also omitted from the end where we are set up for the controversy surrounding Voldemort's return and this made the ending fall flat. Where are all the reactions to what Harry has reported? It was a let down ending.",0
178,10.0,"This is without a doubt the best Harry Potter film yet! There were many funny moments and the special effects were excellent. When you compare the story with the book, there were big gaping holes in the plot. There were also major changes to the plot line that I think ruined the story. Also many of the background stories/information were left out and a person who has not read the book may be left confused. I do understand that it is not possible to fit everything into two and a half hours but certain information are important for the remaining books. However, all in all the film was great and I enjoyed it very much. If the next one is anything like this one, I am definitely looking forward to it.",1
179,1.0,"At last the best book in the series gets onto the big screen. Was it worth the wait; No! It was a waste of time, I wish I could get my two and half hours back. The film leaves out all the great scenes in the novel and presents us with a film a ten year old made on his IMac. The acting however is great however miscast should be the word used to describe it. Ralph Fiennes, a great actor, is not right for Voldermort. He in my opinion is too nice. If it wasn't for JK Rowlings stance on an all British/European Cast, the character would have been greatly realised. In my opinion either John Malkovich or Willen Dafoe would have been amazing in the role. Miranda Richardson, despite giving a great performance as Rita Skeeter, is just too pretty for the role. If you grew up in England during the 1980s, many would know that Richardson was a pin up, and in my POV still is. Brendon Gleeson however is perfect casting for Moody, he has the appearance and the behaviour. I hope he continues. As for the kids, Radcliffe gets worse as time goes on. Whilst Watson and Grint have 'Wasted Talent' written over their CV's, I hope they leave the Hogwarts set and enlist in another production. Robert Pattison as Cedric Diggory surprised me with his performance, shame he isn't younger cause he would be fantastic for the Harry Potter role. Whilst Katie Leung as Cho Chang is beyond description since she is rarely seen, also she's annoying. Overall this film lacked all the imagination that made the book great. Not recommended for either HP fans nor for the uninitiated.",1

181,10.0,i thought that the film was really good well worth my money i thought they did really well with all the things going off it was excellent. i also thought the actors and actresses were very well chosen and worked well with each other. I thought voldermort was very very good because nobody ever seen him before it must have been very hard to for-fill every ones expectations. I thought it was funny and it kept you wanting more. my favourite part was when they went into the maze and ' mad eye moody 'pointed the way he should go. Like i said before it is a lot a peoples favourite book and there was a lot a expectations for the cast and crew to fill and they did it beautiful. When it said you have to fill 10 lines i thought it would be really hard but it was very easy finding good things to say about the film i also enjoyed the bathtub sense. Joanne Topiing ***** 10/10,1

184,7.0,"Concise edited highlights, although what was kept in was done very well. Although the film is two and a half hours, there are some very abrupt cuts from one scene to another, and a lot is out of sequence. That said, there are some scenes which are directly from the book, while others are similar but missing a key point - when the boys are oggling the Beauxbaton girls, Hermione has a good retort - ""if you too would like to put yours eyes back in"" instead we just get a shot of her looking annoyed. One or two changes which I liked were the dance lessons, and the rebirth of Voldemort. Some of the things I disliked were very obvious mistakes, like Voldemort having normal eyes, the cup being made of crystal instead of silver, Amos having no beard, a lot of missing characters, wormtail cutting off his hand with no reaction, he should be writhing on the ground in pain and so on. I dislike changes being made to the story for no apparent reason. There is very little in the books that would not work on screen, and having read Steve Kloves scripts for the first three films I think he did a very good job. Pity we did not see his script on screen. I still think each book should be done as a mini series to cover all the details and bring to life jo's wonderful dialogue.",1
185,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not only the most technologically advanced of the Potter films thus far, but also the most entertaining. Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Donnie Brasco) is careful with the structure of his film, and keeps the pace moving steadily along. He balances CGI animation (such as a breathtaking underwater sequence) with tender emotional moments involving broken friendships and broken hearts. I did not like the first three Harry Potter films, yet I found this one to be a rather pleasant surprise.",1

188,1.0,"The movie series seems to follow the books, on a far lower level. While the third movie finally showed some character development and well-done plot instead of drawing by numbers some scenes from the novels, everything collapses in this fourth installment. This is partially due to the necessity of omitting lovable subplots which saved the novel. In the movie, the stupid main plot becomes clearly visible - a way to big machinery is installed for reviving Voldemort. Instead of capturing Harry at so many possible situation, or just turning his left shoe into a port-key, the evil secret agent employs incredibly involved tricks to teleport Harry to the cemetery where you-know-who wait for his reincarnation. This comes along as a boring CGI-hopping that lasts almost three hours. ",0

191,1.0,"This movie sucks. The book that bears the same name (but is totally different) is where the series turns from good to great. The movie is where the series turns from okay to BAD. The very first scene departs from the book by adding another person in the Riddle house. The entire part about Harry being home and the Weaslys coming to take him to the Quidditch World Cup and him staying at their house is gone. They move the group from the top box to the nosebleeds for the movie and cut out Winky and her theft of Harry's wand altogether. They show none of the quidditch game, don't show the mascots, and instead of the kids running through the woods and having a confrontation with Draco (which is big in the book for character development), Harry just falls down and gets kicked outside the tent. This is just what is screwed up in the first ten minutes. I actually left the theatre after the dragon broke its chain, chased Harry around campus and then went King Kong on one of the towers. What happened to the dragon, you might ask? Nobody knows. Evidently it's just sleeping down on the grounds somewhere. Hopefully the director will read this page and realize that he needs to quit and never direct another movie again. Ever. Especially not one that ruins a great book.",0

193,1.0,"This movie was the worst Harry Potter movie so far! I can't see how anyone could be satisfied with it. Those who have read the book couldn't possibly accept the important details that were left out in favour for dragged-out, irrelevant scenes. Those who haven't read the book couldn't possibly enjoy the movie either, for so much is left out that it is impossible to correctly follow! Very important scened that are left out include The Parting Of The Ways, where it becomes very clear that the Ministry aren't going to believe Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort, Dumbledore telling Snape and Hagrid to go on their separate missions, any adequate explanation about Barty Crouch Snr or Jnr, and how and why they got into the situations they were in, the winner of the Tri-Wizard Tourament, and there is very little screen-time for Sirius, which means the audience can't see the relationship between him and Harry, which is very important for the events of The Order of the Phoenix! Many more scenes and information have been cut out that really needed to be there, and my advice it to stay away from all the movies, and just keep to the books!",0

I love seeing how these artists have used their imaginations to portray the story by using different means, a screen. Many Harry Potter fans have shown anger and disappointment towards Warner Brothers for not making the movies like the books. They don't realize that that would be almost impossible. Though many of us raving fans would love a 4 hour long movie, the general public would not, therefore resulting in the movies not making nearly as much money as they do now.",0
197,10.0,"This film is in my top 5 movies of all time and the rating is EASILY a 10/10 in my opinion. This movie is consistently great throughout, never has a dull scene. I would say it has about the same amount of twists as Prisoner of Azkaban, it is just as surprising as the 3rd movie. But what makes the Goblet of Fire truly special was that it had roughly the same level of action in it as Deathly Hallows Part II and it was more surprising than Deathly Hallows Part II and on par with Prisoner of Azkaban in that category. So already Goblet of Fire is the better movie on the first watch but watching a genuinely great movie is almost always nearly as good as watching it for the first time for me.",1

That may be why I was so disappointed after actually seeing it. The main problem with ""Goblet of Fire,"" is that Director Mike Newell tried to condense way too much into a two hour movie. I know this has been a criticism of the previous films, but I have never agreed with it until now. There is no way to include everything from the books into the films, and in most cases the cuts in previous films have been just. However in this case, the book was way too long for a two hour movie.",0

Daniel Radcliffe is good but very similar to the last film. He's a good actor but I don't think he is strong enough to lead the franchise. Ironically the real leads are the outstanding supporting characters, such as Alan Rickman's Snape and especially Maggie Smith's McGonagall. Michael Gambon is good but I'm still thinking of Richard Harris when I read the books. Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody is amazing as is Ralph Fiennes as V.... He Who Must Not Be Named!

The ferret scene was absolutely, my favorite! Madame Maxime wasn't as good as I expected, but the girls from Beauxbaton's were cool. The sons of Durmstrang were awesome! I loved them, and Karkarof was dead on. Moody was awesome, no one could have done it better! The build-up to the Quidditch Cup was spectacular, but you don't get to see a character that was introduced, and I had wanted to see. And you don't get to see the Quidditch Cup. Voldemort's sign was awesome, but they changed around some minor plot points to fit into the movie. The Yule ball was okay, but again, the changed some minor details that I had wanted to see. The tri-wizard Tournament was fabulous! I loved all the ""things"" that went with it. It was done extremely well. The graveyard scene was perfect! I can't say more than that, but your expectation of it, will be met and/or exceeded. I guarantee it. I am a huge Harry Potter book fan, and I loved this movie. It probably shouldn't be watched by younger kids or those who get nightmares easily, but I took my niece, age 11, and nephew, age 9, and they loved it.

I was really hoping to see something fantastic in this movie, because it had the story of the fourth book, which is in my opinion the ultimate one from the series. but I was disappointed to the maximum!!!! why?? because it's nothing like the 4th book!!!!!!!! for god's sake, even Hermione's dress was pink when it was blue in the book! they just took the major and general lines of the story, like harry, Hogwarts, the Triwizard Tournament, Durmastrang & Beauxbatons, 3 challenges, Cedric dead and Voldy comes back! and that's about it!!it goes much too quickly from one action, one bump in the road to another and for those who haven't read the books, it will be awfully hard to understand something! I didn't even notice when i was standing in front of the first task! it all happened too fast!things are totally different and they didn't follow the book AT ALL!!!! after stating so many times that they tried to be loyal to the book, i thought they really had been....well...i was wrong! i have 2 major discontents that bugged me through the movie!!1. Ludo Bagman doesn't appear at all....and he was a rather charming and important character in the book. 2. Michael Gambon does a poor, a very poor job....he didn't understand Dumbledore's character at all! Dumbledore is supposed to be calm, rational, not impulsive and yelling at students that Cedric is dead or to harry whether he put his name in the goblet of fire! and Dumbledore is surely not supposed to be this wacko genius who sits on the floor and talks to harry about very important stuff! god...if that was indeed Dumbledore in the book, i would've been happy when he died in the 6th one!!! But it's not!!!! Dumbledore is the guardian, the best wizard alive, the only one who can protect harry against Voldy and he shouldn't be yelling or spitting life theories on the floor!! i hate Michael Gambon for transforming the character into such a loser, literally, i wish they had a chosen another actor! so, as a conclusion, you should go to the cinema and see it, but don't have high expectations, like i did! it will only get you down ever worse!",0

Anyone following the movies only, will have problems following along as they move so quickly. You do not have a chance to enjoy the type of depth that the previous movies portrayed. For example, during the first 10 minutes, you go from Harry seeing the vision of the caretaker, to waking up in a bed at the weasly's. Then after being woke up they are out the door and going to the port-key. The Dursly's and Weasly's are to me an important part of tying the movies together and giving us a home base if you will. Compared to the book, you miss the weasly's trip via flu powder to get Harry and getting stuck in the Dursely's fireplace, and it exploding to reveal the Weasly's. And what about Dudley, eating that thing that makes his tongue get extremely long by one of Ron's brothers and then the showdown where Auther Weasly tells off the Dursleys. That scene would have been most enjoyable and would add a little comedy as well. ",1

I was particularly concerend about this movie because there was so much material and so many subplots that all seemed relevant that I wondered how it would be done. I agree with the fact that making two movies probably would have cost too much and may have ruined the series (ala matrix) BUT there were a few key details that were integral to the next book that were left out. Without going too much into that, its evident that the acting of the 3 main stars has vastly improved and to be quiet honest this movie would have failed without them. If you watch the movie from the beginning you can see that not only have the characters developed but so have the actors. Their working with very limited material and they do a heck of a good job. I will not say too much of the directing because the previous two directors took many liberties and Mike Newell is no exception. To be quite honest I think it lived up to my expectations and not more. If we want to go into technicality I would give it an 8.7/10 but its just easier to round up.",0

They cut out too much important stuff that supports the next book and it seems like they rushed through this. The cemetery scene and the first task with the dragon was depicted well, but they kept out the 2 house elves, the Dursleys and Mrs. Weasley, and I didn't like how Dumbledore or the Madame was portrayed. Understanding of course that time is not on a directors side, but information and detail was definitely lacking. The main three are still great together and thankfully they kept the twins more involved.

221,3.0,"As hyped up as this movie was, i was extremely disappointed. I am a huge fan of the books, and a fan of the other movies. I realize the director and writers had only a short time span to work with(even the most devoted harry potter fan would not sit through the 9 or 10 hours the full book would take up in movie form) but even so,they left out extremely crucial pieces of the plot, and instead of the intricately woven plot that Rowling put together in the book, the movie was summarized into a few jarring, disconnected scenes which barely captured the very essentials of the book. And even this wasn't very well thought out. The scene where Barty crouch jr. is revealed is the place in the book where everything the reader has been wondering about is suddenly pulled together as voldemort's ingenious plan is slowly unraveled. Instead in the movie, when the time comes, nothing the viewer didn't already know is revealed. And now for those of you who are shaking their heads at my comment and saying ""they did a terrific job with what they were given"" even you can't argue with my next point. They altered the very personalities of two main characters. For the observant ones out there i'm sure you know I'm referring to Cedric Diggory and Albus Dumbledore. Lets start with Diggory, in the book he was known as a kind hearted, noble boy who always did his best to be fair(a bit of a pansy in my opinion, but maybe thats a little harsh) in the movie, in the scene where harry and Cedric are desperately sprinting towards the cup(minus one giant spider....but i'm done complaining about all the things they left out) Cedric not actually *shoves* harry out of the way as he runs, not giving harry a backwards glance. And as they approach the cup together, instead of looking at harry with a mixture of longing for the cup and thankfulness to harry for saving his butt, he snaps at harry to take the cup with seemingly nothing in his tone but regret and anger that he feels he now owes the cup to harry. thats not the Cedric diggory readers of the series have grown to love. And albus dumbledore was much more fierce and violent than he is in the books. the whole purpose of dumbledore is that he is quiet, calm, and above everything. almost godlike(before the 6th book) in this one, when he discovers Barty crouch with harry in the end, he actually *throttles* him with his bare hands and asks to know where alastor is. This type of muggle violence is so uncharacteristic of the real albus. So all in all, quite disappointing movie, although i will say one thing. Daniel Radcliffe and his crew have come a long way. The fact that this movie was a total travesty is by no means the fault of the crew, who did an excellent job. And looked very good doing it. (I'm referring mainly to the ill fated Cedric diggory. may he rest in peace)",0

I cracked up at the scene when Ron puts on his ""dress robe"" and Ralph Fiennes did an awesome job -- they couldn't have found anyone better. While staying mostly true to the plot lines of the book, this movie (and perhaps the book as well) exchanged some of its magical awe for more grown-up ""teen angst"" conflicts between the characters.

225,4.0,"It's taken me 15 years to write a review, because the disappointment still stings. This film is god awful- the adaptation, acting, pacing, tone, music, and mostly, what is responsible for all listed, the DIRECTION. Newell admits the book was so long and tedious, and he should not have been given the project. He answers most questions that were revealed over the course of the novel in the first 20 min, leaving little mystery to uncover. The music distracts and doesn't measure up in the slightest to the genius Williams composed for the first 3. And after Azkaban, which was impeccable, Newell tried to compete (admittedly) with the previous director, rather than build on his work. Newell focuses on being loud and exciting, leaving no real nuanced character development. His direction to the actors is abhorrent. He had Dumbledore do a 180 from books and films to be constantly angry, leaving the peak moment of Dumbledore's at the end, where he's actually furious, anticlimactic. Hermione overacts, as well as others, uncharacteristically for the actors. David Tennent's Crouch Jr is so bad, I was surprised to find out what a stellar actor he is, and the changes in his storyline are unforgivable. The best pieces are cut or unnecessarily changed, and the pacing is a mess. The second and third tournaments are shown back to back, which is jolting. And then the end is just the trio being oddly optimistic, clashing terribly with the context, as well as the source material. I. Just. Hate. It. I wish it could be remade.",0
226,5.0,"As an avid HP fan I must say that the movie was huge let down. I mean the director or the scriptwriter...have completely missed the point of the book. The book is not only about how Harry wins the Triwizard tournament or how Lord Voldermont returns....yet it seems as though thats all the movie is about. All the interesting interactions of the characters have been cut for adding unnecessary mindless (however spectacular) action. The movie is VERY CHOPPY and never allows the viewer time to actually register any of the events. Though overall the movie was not at all what I expected here are some of the things that I really hated: Cheesy dialogs like Harry saying ""I love magic"" when he sees the tent for the Quidditch world cup.",0
227,7.0,"Having seen The Goblet of Fire twice now, and enjoyed and thought much of it by the way, I am having disappointing thoughts that, firstly, a film of this length is not allowed an intermission of perhaps five minutes as was given in lengthy films in the past. The experience became a marathon for my bladder and bottom near the end and actually drew my attention away from the experience I was supposed to be having. Secondly, I am now convinced that the book, being so lengthy, should have been turned into two films, the second perhaps released a month after the first. That's not been done before? So what? The series is so ground-breaking anyway that not much speculation would have been needed for it to succeed. Because, amongst my general satisfaction overall for the film, I was nevertheless disappointed that so much was omitted from the book. However...as much as I enjoyed it, I am beginning to see the series as a vehicle (not a showcase) for our well-known British actors who seem to be 'jumping on the bandwagon' of its roller coaster and much deserved success I may add. These inclusions of famous faces, to me, draw attention away and prevent me from becoming completely immersed into the story. Perhaps its an age thing but I would have liked to have seen more unknowns in it, ones with no associations from previous films. One further complication as viewed through my speculative eyes is that it has become 'darker' as almost everybody has noticed. In my view and from a children's book point of view, this diversion from the original shows a lack of imagination and creation and furthermore, I believe, reflects the problems we are having in our present day societies. Therefore, this then becomes less of a fantasy which could be described as groundbreaking and a modern classic, and more about an author's unrealised fears. I think the film took itself too seriously. It is plain to me where JK Rowland is going. Beware Ron Weasley! Molly Cutpurse www.mollycutpurse.com",0
228,7.0,"Last night I went to go and see the midnight showing of the latest installment of the Harry Potter film series. I must say the graphics and special effects were most impressive, and the details were magnificent. But this movie does NOT do the book justice, anyone who is a true fan of the books could tell you that. The sheer volume of information that was left out of this movie almost made me sick. They cut out several highly important characters from the book, such as Winky the house-elf, Ludo Bagman, The Dursleys, and Molly and Percy Weasly, but yet they had time to add in nonsense scenes that never occurred in the book. One of the greatest blows was that they did not even show the quidditch world cup being played! The merely introduced it and then switched the next scene. The rapid switching of the scenes was to become commonplace throughout the movie, and I feel that if I was not already overly familiar with he books that I would not be able to understand it. If the studio would have made it into two movies and not tried to cram the 600+ page book, it would have been one of the most stunning movies of this year. but as it stands, it is a disappointment to the book, and to Harry Potter fans everywhere.",1
229,8.0,"I saw this film with a friend who had not read the book and she was (understandably!) rather confused! It is very much the fourth film in a sequence and expects some prior knowledge from its viewers. However, I don't think this is unreasonable - you can't keep explaining the rules of Quidditch! ",0
230,4.0,"Maybe it was just my high expectations after enjoying Prisoner of Azkaban so greatly, but my wife and I were both disappointed by Goblet. The plot seemed to be something of a rehash of Azkaban, Harry wasn't much of a hero (people did things For him and To him, but he didn't do a whole lot to prove what a great guy he was), lots of plot threads were included that didn't seem to be needed (we haven't read the books, but it's painfully obvious when something was included ""just because it was in the book""), and there wasn't enough teen angst, which was by far the best part of the movie. Less of trite snoopy reporters! More wistful puppy love! Also, there seemed to be a LOT of logic flaws--many things happen that don't make sense or don't go anywhere. Maybe they're explained in the book (in fact it seems quite likely). Maybe they'll be explained next movie. It's pretty annoying to have to wait two years, if that's the case.",0
231,10.0,"This movie was incredible. Not only in the story line itself, but also with the effects and performances of the actors. The movie sucked me in from the very beginning. I jumped at some parts of the movie and almost cried at the ending because Daniel Radcliffe gave such a powerful performance. While the movie was not exactly like the book, I am not in the least bit disappointed. They did a magnificent job in presenting Voldemort. And everyone is making a huge deal out of the PG-13 rating. Younger audiences will probably have very little trouble dealing with the graphic images, especially the ones who have read the books. It had a good balance of suspense, character growth, and humor. While this is the darkest of the series so far, it was somewhat lightened by the constant humor (i.e. Mad Eye Moody and Professor Snape). This is the first movie to show real growth in the characters, a developing love story and a preview of the trouble yet to come forth.",1
232,10.0,"I cannot count on one hand how many times I had read the book. I absolutely LOVE the book and I had very high expectations for the movie. I agonized with myself how in the heck were they going to slim it down to under 3 hours, but they did it. Like the last movie, I expected major plot aspects to be left out of this movie. I feel that Prisoner of Azkaban (POA) left to much important details out to focus on other things. Don't get me wrong though it was a good movie but don't get me started on what they should have included.",0

234,5.0,"The latest rendition of the Harry Potter books is not quite as intriguing as the last three. While the casting and acting remained excellent, there were several poor directorial decisions that ultimately contributed to weakness of the film.",0
235,10.0,"The Goblet of Fire was the first book in the Harry Potter series that I actually read (i know, lets start at the very beginning a very good place to start - you don't have to say it) and it soon became the best book that i had ever read. Even when i went back to the start and read all the other plus the 2 most recent, the Goblet of Fire still remains for me my fave book! So it was with trepidation that i approached this movie, even though i had loved the past 3 films i had felt that nothing had come close to the excellence of the books! In my opinion, not only was the Goblet of Fire the best book i had ever read but now in my personal opinion the film adaptation is the best film i have ever seen! From the moment we see poor old Eric Sykes die a horrible death (he probably deserved it for all those crappy 'sykes' episodes) to the stunning yuletide ball, to the dragons, merpeople, beautiful beauxbatons, hunky durmstrangs, and the sublime maze scenes - this film was a f*****g cracker! Go see it, even just to see mmmmiiiiissss Jones (Frances De La Tour) from Rising Damp as the elgant Madame Maxine or even just to see Daniel Radcliffe topless he he Once again, go see it",1
236,7.0,"There was an opportunity for the 4th installment in the Harry Potter franchise to be nothing short of great. But I simply can't agree with those who have given this movie a high review, and here's why: As suggested by others, in order to bring a 700+ page book into a 2-1/2 hour movie, some (or a lot) of story elements would have to be deleted. Normally this isn't an insurmountable problem. However, in 'The Goblet of Fire' story, it is exactly those 'extra' elements that make this story wonderful. If there's one thing anyone who has read most or all of the J.K. Rowling books knows, it's that there are no unnecessary, unimportant, or otherwise 'extra' elements in her stories. That is one of the key reasons the books are cut above everything else. The end result for the movie is that we are left with an extremely jumpy storyline that simply follows the critical path, providing the viewer with only the most basic information to keep the plot moving forward. There is absolutely no in-depth character development whatsoever. The book was FILLED with wonderful character background history, especially the Professor Moody character. The movie barely scratched the surface. In addition, there was little or no continuity between the major scenes, and almost no feel for the passage of time. This was supposed to be an entire school year, but other than the changes in the weather, the audience would never know it. For anyone who's been to Disneyland, the best analogy I can think of is that this movie is like taking a trip to Disneyland, staying only 2 or 3 hours and only going on the 3 biggest rides - then rushing back home to heat up some microwave dinner. Now, absolutely that beats a trip to the dentist. But when you get home and think back to all of the things you missed, will you really be satisfied with the experience? I wouldn't . . . and I wasn't. Look, the bottom line is that these books (starting with Azkaban) needed to be multi-part movies, similar to Kill Bill Vol 1&2 or the last 2 Matrix movies which were actually one movie broken into 2 parts. Azkaban needed to be a 2-part movie and 'Goblet of Fire' needed to be 3-part. What really blows me away is that the studio doesn't recognize this. It couldn't have taken much more (if any) production time to make a 6 or 7 hour 3-part movie. In fact, I wouldn't doubt that the cutting room floor already contains the other two movies. Ticket sales would be just as high for each of the 3 episodes as it would be for the one (as proved by the Matrix), so why not maximize the studio profit and the audience viewing pleasure by giving this movie the full attention to detail it truly deserves?",0

241,9.0,"What a grand movie, and what a relief that the cinematic Goblet of Fire captured the spirit of the Potter books this time around! Unlike the screen version of Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie ""gets it"" with regard to what is and is not important. While almost all of the book's sub-plots had to be omitted, just about everything important made it into this film, even if the way it was included was altered slightly. The changes were believable and the none of the essential elements of the story were lost. I add my voice to those declaring Goblet of Fire by far the best of the Potter movies.",1
242,5.0,"First of all, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie, and I would have rated it a 10 if not for the following reasons. My favorite characters, other than the main ones (Harry, Ron and Hermione), were completely left out of the movie. The scene with the Dursley's (in the book, when the Weasley's come for Harry) was so great, it should have been in the movie. I was really disappointed about not seeing Dobby or Sirius. Okay, maybe they aren't absolutely necessary, but they are both pretty important in Harry's life. I would rather sit through a longer movie that includes all the essential parts of the story than a shorter version with outstanding special effects.",1

246,7.0,"HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the latest Harry Potter adaptation, director Newell takes a new kind of breed into the most popular movie series around.

Rowling's books makes the big screen.",1
247,10.0,"I thought that this was by far the best of the Harry Potter films. Yes, they had to reduce certain parts of the story in order to make the film and acceptable length, but the editing was done well. The only short coming to the film was the fact that the director left out a scene in which the characters announce that the Order of the Phoenix is being called up to fight Voldemort - however, this omission does not hurt this film the way that the omission of the explanation of the names on the Marauder's Map hurt the third film. Apart from this being the only real shortcoming, this film exhibited a higher level of humor, truly British in its nature. The fact that Mike Newell is the first British Director most likely has some part in this. I found that the theatre resounded with laughter on numerous occasions throughout the film. The characters also seemed to blend together in a more seamless manner than they have before. I feel that it would be in the film maker's best interest to keep Newell on for the remainder of the series. This is the best acting thus far that I have witnessed on behalf of the younger actors. The only recommendation that I could make would be to include the adult characters more. Such wonderful actors are cast in the supporting role - I would love to see them with more air time.",1
248,8.0,"Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione(Emma Watson), and the Weaselys attend the Quidditch world cup over their summer break, but it is terrorized my a large amount of Death-Eaters shortly after the match, showing signs of Voldemort's loyalty.",1
249,9.0,"I liked Goblet of fire better than Prisoner of Azkaban. Though it could have been longer and not skipped so much. The music was perfect and the scenery around the castle was enchanting. I will go to see it again this week because it was great. All in all the film is well done and believable. Mad Eye Moody is a little to funny looking to be frightening to an adult and Dumbledore seems less mellow than the book shows him to be. The dragon challenge is exciting but only showed Harry and his dragon. The Underwater rescue was the best of the three challenges in my opinion. The Yule Ball is fantastic, the young ladies were so sweet in their gowns and the young men were so typically uncomfortable. Rita Skeeter is very well done and the quick quotes quill was really neat. I did not like how tall they made Madame Maxime look, though her character was well done. I really missed Winkie and Dobby, after all they were important in the story. The maze lacked the Sphinx, the Scroots, the giant spider and the magic mist that turned Harry upside down but it was certainly scary enough to make up for it. The death of Cedric, the battle with Voldemort(he is really creepy looking)and the scene when Harry returns with Cedric's body are excellent. Cedric is almost a prince charming in many ways. At the end I though it sad that nothing was done with the sending of Snape, Hagrid and others to prepare for the Order of the Phoenix reorganizing in the next book.",1
250,10.0,"You could say that the other 3 movies are just fun kid movies compared to this one. Things get more personal and serious. In the other films they would let little mistakes and things pass, but in this one, there's no messing around...You already know the characters, so this movie doesn't take much time to just show them hanging just having random conversations. Instead this movie is non-stop intense straight to the point action. Amazing is what it was, AND LONG TOO. Long in a good way, some long movies are bad, but ones like this that are very informative the whole entire time, with intense action a long side that are why movies are made.",1

252,9.0,"For me, one of the most exciting series of movies is the 'Harry Potter' movies. Being a moderate fan of the books (I read 1-4), I found it hard to read them all. I wanted to, but they are just so long and time consuming. To be perfectly honest, I really don't have the time to read them, so I just go see the films. No matter how long they are they never drag and they always hold my attention which is very, very rare for any film no matter how long. Going to to the latest installment 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', I had extremely high expectations that got met for the most part. I was expecting 'Goblet of Fire' to be so much better than 'Prisoner of Azkaban' since they keep getting better, but actually I found 'Goblet' and 'Prisoner' to be equal in quality. You could say I was a tad disappointed, but even still, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is an amazing motion picture that never, ever had me bored during it's entire 2 hour and 40 minute runtime. I was absolutely enthralled from start to finish.",1
253,7.0,"Well, it looks like WB decided to save some money on production of this one. They probably thought: ""Hey, the fans are addicted already, they'll go see it anyway."" So, they cut some corners. What a shame! It is understandable that the book is too big to fit into one movie, but cutting plot lines and abbreviating should still produce logically complete picture. But this one -- looks like they overdid it with the cutting. It looked like they made it a set of visual illustrations for the book. Spectacular, but incomplete and quite incomprehensible without reading it.",0
254,1.0,This movie is so bad for fans of the book. They just have stuff not explained and I can't say it here because it would be a spoiler. The movie is boring and all the scenes that were so great in the book are either shortened or not exciting or scary like in the book. The worst thing is it keeps not setting up movie 5 and now movie 5 will probably be terrible but not as bad as this because this one was really bad! What I liked was the 3 actors Harry Hermione and Ron. They were better than ever! That's almost all the movie has good. Even the tri-wizard stuff is not that exciting. Dumbledore acts weird and mean and nothing like Dumbledore has ever acted. Wait until you see Dumbledore you will be shocked he is like a jerk! I wanted to love this movie because I'm a Harry Potter fan and love all 6 books and I loved the 2nd and 3rd movie and thought the 1st movie was even pretty good but this one is just bad.

258,9.0,"I had a great time watching this film. I'm always concerned that book-to-film adaptations will lose a lot of the finer points of the book, but that's not the case here. The writing team very nicely trimmed the fat of the book and even enhanced it as they realized there are six distinct acts of the narrative, and the rest is non-essential. The only noteworthy plot ""changes"" are that Barty Crouch Jr appears in the first scene, and the third task definitely changed (no cloud, skrewt, or sphinx). No house elves either, so anything that Dobby or Winky did was assigned to someone else. They also chopped a ton off the introduction (gimme more Mr. Weasley!) A couple other quick complaints: Hermione becomes a bit of a tramp (Ron, Harry, and her Ball date all seem to be getting some) and Dumbledore displays a violent temper (Richard Harris is sorely missed - Gambon's comments about Dumbledore show he's not in tune with the character). The lead-up to and the Yule Ball scene were hilarious - boys and girls are so dumb at age 14. The new cast additions are all great: Mad-Eye Moody is magnificent, Rita Skeeter is correctly abominable (but underused) and you can't help but have a huge crush on Cho Chang. The tournament tasks are appropriately breathtaking and the graveyard scene is equally creepy and exhilarating (what a surprise, Ralph Fiennes is great). I'm thrilled they got this one right; good luck making a movie of the 5th book.",1

My daughter(who is only 3) loved all the scenes (Yes, she was wide awake throughout the movie!!!)! I'd say this movie is definitely for kids (and the kid in all of us!). Harry and the gang growing up to be adults and their love interests were well rendered. Radcliffe as Harry was charming and so was Ms Watson, who is blossoming into a charming lady. Ron did n't seem to have too much to say in this movie I think. Lot of puns on him though!! Poor Ron!!! ",1
260,5.0,"I am beginning to wonder if this movie franchise is becoming ""the thing to do"" directorially speaking concerning the last two HP ""efforts"". I feel that the dignity of the series is getting lost in dollars and cents. Watching GOF, I could not help but feel as though I had grabbed onto a port-key and was whisked forward at breakneck speed, seeing one scene painfully blurred into another. The book (which is a favorite in the series so far for many, myself included)is very detailed and I am sure anyone would sit through a three hour GOF to see on screen what their mind's eye saw as they read the book. Not that another half hour would cover everything in the book but at least the viewer might not feel as though they've been shot out of a cannon landing head first in a soggy Quidditch field. The scope of the GOF story is a tremendous epic and I agree with many fans that way too many vital details have been left out completely. This is a shame because many of the subplots lead into the next story. Most disturbing, especially if you are a fan of the book is the fact that some of what is shown on screen has been altered unnecessarily. For what purpose? Yet, the feel of this story and the series does come across on screen. ",0

However, it was an excellent bet and gave fairly good results, with the film to show a marked improvement and the first use of massive and impressive special and computerized effects. It's also the first film where we see Harry Potter and his friends as teenagers they already are, a brand that comes up, very quietly, in the book, but Newell explores in this film, where the action and fight scenes also become more intense.

This movie was also the perfect length. Every scene was well done, and I think the director did a fantastic job. Also, many teenagers along the female variety found some of the guys in here very attractive, including myself, but that's not really relevant.

The special effects, the actors' performances, the music, EVERYTHING makes this movie the best I've seen in many years. I insist that you convince everyone to go with you and watch the movie, even if you have to see it 20 times, it'll be worth it.

The CGI effects serve the film beautifully but never take over. The direction and pace of this film is perfectly done.To my mind Mike Newell solves a problem that Peter Jackson never quite solved with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which were always headlong, breathless races against time. 'Goblet'never feels rushed and 150 minutes is the perfect length for this film. The climax is very satisfying because it is not a big bang; by allowing the three co-stars a human moment of recognition of their own changes to be the last word in the film rather than a pyrotechnical climax, Newelllets us see who these people are becoming and sets the stage perfectly for the next entry, The Half-blood Prince.

274,5.0,"I wonder if they thought we wouldn't notice? Where were Dobby and Winky? Winky was an important part of the film especially regarding Barty Crouch Jnr. I was also quite disappointed that in the pensive scene the trial was never properly explained, and other characters that will become important in future were completely missed. Hagrid is back as caretaker and not care of magical creatures teacher as he should be, and the part regarding his parentage is glossed over completely. Blink and you missed it. The annoying Rita Skeeter was so insignificant i wonder why she was there. My personal opinion is that it was maybe too big a book to take on, there is really just too much missing. Finally the maze, where were the magical obstacles to overcome? Agreed a talking sphinx could be troublesome, but what about Hagrids Blast ended skrewts? Surely someone could have come up with something !",0

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the summit, the best direction and music, they knew the next one was suppose to be a success, so why spend more money! lets make a cheap movie, it will make us rich!!! The script was OK but it was unnecessary to show the first scenes with the tournament, it could have been better to focus on the goblet of fire itself, more interesting scenes there. Brendan Gleeson was superb, the only that was really good one, really. It was shocking the change in music, I was used to John Williams good instrumentation.

279,7.0,"'The Goblet of Fire' is the most traditionally exciting (a maze, dragons, mermaids, flying horses) of all the Harry Potter books, so expectations for this film are greater than for the other films. I expected to see Screen magic. Once Mike Newell had decided which plots to omit completely he should have made up for loss of comedy (Dursleys, House Elves), proved to be a success in the other films, but he didn't. The result is reminiscent of Director Chris Columbus's handling of the 1st film, 'The Philosopher's Stone', which was almost impossible to follow unless having read the book first. Of the three Directors to make the Harry Potter films, it was the Director whose first language was not English, who made the most complete and professional film - what does this mean?",0
280,1.0,"I have liked all the movies so far, but this one you could tell they left a lot out and/or changed the story because they were too lazy to tell it right. I am a strong supporter of making a movie as long as it needs to be to tell the story right. Setting a certain length and trying to squeeze material in is just downright sloppy. Mike Newell has only proved one thing to the world with this movie -- he is not ready to play with the big boys. Stick to your sloppy B movies Mike. Stay away from making movies that have the potential to be masterpieces. If the next movie, which thankfully is being directed by someone other than Newell, veers away from the storyline in the manner Goblet of Fire has I would say the Harry Potter series is essentially doomed at least for those of us who have read the books and see what a mess Newell made of it so far. Tell the story the way Rowling has told it, tell it in the same order, and don't change things to make your job easier. Sloppy sloppy sloppy!!!",0
281,5.0,"Whilst I recognise and applaud the visuals in GoF, fans of the written word will be disappointed at the shoddy shoe horning of the, admittedly epic, storyline into such a short space of time. Characters such as Snape, Malfoy Jnr, McGonagall, Hagrid, Rita Skeeter are pared down to the bone, whilst others such as Winky, the Dursleys, Bill, Charlie and Mrs Weasley have been completely left out. The Quidditch World Cup has inaccuracies (the Weasleys should be seated in the Top box with the Malfoys), Rita Skeeter's many articles are reduced to only one, Barty Crouch Jnr does not appear at the beginning with Voldemort and Wormtail, the Death-Eaters did not turn the campsite at the QWC into the war zone depicted in the film. And so on. Probably the worst bit of 'plot changing' was having Michael Gambon (a very poor Richard Harris replacement - ever heard of Peter O'Toole?) actually grabbing Harry and almost assaulting him during the ""did you/didn't you"" put your name in the GoF scene. Dumbledore never touches his students like that and makes much of it when other teachers do it in Order of the Phoenix. All in all a sad disappointment for the discerning JK Rowling fan and, judging by the various comments heard in the cinema immediately after the end of the film, easy money for Warner Bros. 5 out of 10 is perhaps, somewhat generous.",0

This is without doubt the best in the series so far. the other films will have to be the best ever made to beat this! Some of the scenes were amazing from the Quidditch game in the large arena to the chase in the massive maze at the end. The acting is superb from everyone. There was not one performance in this film i did not enjoy - they were all equally brilliant! Another reason why i loved this film is that i did not think The Prisoner of Azkaban was that brilliant.

I was really disappointed at how pathetic voldemort was, come on hes suppose to be this mighty person but he was portrayed as this higher pitched man. i was expecting booming low or something frightening. There was definitely a lack of character development everything was like event event event and just kind of lost its magic for me in the process.

Mike Newell has apparently no idea what belongs in a good Harry Potter Movie, it's a good thing he's not directing the fifth one. The following aspects of this movie are very wrong: 1. the story, a person who hasn't read the book can't follow and a person who has thinks the movie's worthless. 2. The visual effects, even I can make a better blue key image of Harry flying a broomstick, for crying out loud. 3. The director, a word of advice, NEVER MAKE ANYTHING EVER AGAIN !!!

289,7.0,"It is impossible to make a movie based on a book that will please all fans, but you have to wonder if any of these directors or writers have looked at the books, because how can you direct or write something that you know nothing about? Why can't Rowling write the scripts? Even if attempts are made to make a film that doesn't resemble the book, it has to resemble something. Fans don't like this because the book has been gutted and newcomers haven't the slightest clue what is going on because nothing explanatory has been added. Action and suspense have been enhanced in the last two movies and now it is coherence that is fading away. The movie looks great. The first two challenges were good, the scene where Sirius Black's face appears in a pile of ash was brilliant, and casting Ralph Fiennes and Miranda Richardson as (the snake-like) Lord Voldemort and (the sleazy) Rita Skeeter were acts of genius. The problem is that you could put the greatest director of all time in the seat and if he doesn't have a view on what he is directing and a great script(damn you Steve Kloves) than he will fail. This should have been the greatest Harry Potter film yet, instead it is the weakest since Harry Potter and The Sorceror's Stone. I don't care if J.K Rowling or Daved Yates's version of Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix goes into movie theater's, as long as there is somebody who takes this stellar cast and makes a fine movie out of this pivotal book.",0

For me all movies are below Harry Potter.,1
293,10.0,"Prior to seeing 'Goblet of Fire' I have never read any of the novels. I was just a fan of the movies since their debut. But after watching 'Goblet' I was finally convinced to start reading the series. That's the effect this film had on me and now I'm very much into the Harry Potter world. I can see that this one was rushed more so than the others, I wouldn't have mind if it was longer, but unlike me most people would object. I think what is most satisfying, especially to someone who never read the books before is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and everyone else is growing up and the problems they face are getting more serious. I've seen 'Goblet' three times now and I plan on seeing again it on IMAX. So for those who are already avid readers of this Rowling series, it does cover the important points, but they are rushed. And for those who are just movie-goers who could care less about the actual book itself, I think you're in for a real treat. Plus, I thought Cho Change (Leung) was a cutie, just how she is supposed to be, hope to see her the next one.",1

I recognized a very deep character change / alter, which is totally new in the Potter movies (I watched 1,2,3 directly afterwards). The characters grew up and mutate into young sentimentally people with many adventures and creatures and particularly magic. What can I say, it's truly the best Harry Potter movie ever, and I hope the next will get even better, what I really doubt. It's kinda weird, but I think it couldn't be done any better, so i recommend it for everyone - young and old.",1

At times it really scratches the surface without explaining what certain things have to do with the plot of the story and like the others, and not a great problem, it's overlong. The scene with Voldemort seems like it should be in a completely different film. However, unlike the others this is getting greatly more grownup; it has a wonderful romantic presence and has a great deal of emotion and grunt to it. Brendan Gleeson is fantastic as the latest teacher Mad-Eye Moody and so is the, more cameo, appearance by Miranda Richardson.",1

That Quidditch match at the beginning of the novel seemed unnecessary and the film cut out the Dursley scenes completely.

305,,"I went to see this film at Vue at 4:00 today and I was really hoping for entertaining Potter film - I got one but the price for it was a very rushed film. My main criticisms for this film other than it was too choppy is that Emma Watson's acting became a bit too over-the-top at times, and as much as I admire the girl, it just has to be said. I also found some parts to be laughable(mostly with Emma in them) when it wasn't meant to be. An example of this is the over emphasising of her points she makes with her eyebrows and how she acted in the Defense Against The Dark Arts lesson scene when she answered the question of 'Unforgivable Curses'.",0
306,1.0,"This movie was possibly the second worst movie I've seen in my entire life (only Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was worse). Not only did they fail to cover the nuances present in the book, but the acting was just plain dull. Sirius Black only appears once in the entire book and only through the flames! He's supposed to be staying in Hogsmeade in a cave! The problems with Rita Skeeter were downplayed dramatically as well, as were Harry's problems with his scar and Voldemort. To the director/screenwriter: don't cut so much. If the movie gets too long, oh well. If you're going to make a movie based on a book, you need the nuances that are present inside the book.",0

I don't think he would act that way but it's only a book,not reality^^'Still the movie was good.

But the movie is wonderfully made and this is the first Harry Potter movie which has emotions in it. It is dark, dangerous and sometimes keeps you at the edge of your seat. The scenes are really well shot and the appearance of Voldemort in the graveyard is one of the most spectacular scenes in the movie. The movie shows us that Harry and his friends have now matured. It brings out the best in the actors and actresses. The movie has it share of humor as well and Ron is hilarious. The relation between Ron, Hermione and Harry is very touching and the wail of Mr. Diggory rings in your ears several minutes after the scene is over. The movie in true words is Magical.",1

As an avid reader, I never expect books to measure up to movies, but as long as the essence is caught, I'm good. Part of ROwling's magic is to insert details (seemingly small ones) at various parts in various books, and turn them into a larger story line later. I feel like the next movies are going to have to be dramatically altered. WIthout going in to all huge parts left out and all the ""twists"" from the original story that other reader did, suffice it to say that the whole think went by in a blur. No significance was given to anything. You don't feel passionately about anything! Not the fact that Harry is Prentiss (because of the absence of Sirius), not the struggle in the tournament, nor his developing crush on Cho.

If the book hadn't been written, sure, the movie would be fine. BUT the book was good enough and they went and butchered it.

There are several glaring omissions in the storyline, which will be readily apparent if you have read the book. I thought that it was a complete waste of time introducing the character of Rita Skeeter (Richardson), with whom very little was done. Dumbledore (who should really be called Bumblebore by this time) is very superficial throughout, leading me to wonder if it's directing or just Gambon's performance. I know the book is very extensive, but in all fairness to the film, in order to sell the story, maybe Warner Bros. should not be so afraid of giving it the Peter Jackson treatment and stretching it to over 3 hours instead of 2.5.

Yes, I know some of you thought it was great, and some terrible, but we must all realize that, this movie would have never covered the whole book unless it was about 36 hours long. I really wish they would have explained Harry's connections with Lord V. and Cho more. They completely left out Rita's secret, and what was that part with the Horn Tail chasing Harry about? AND!! when i found out they were leaving out Dudely's scene I almost didn't want to watch it.They also left out Winky, how can you leave out someone who connects the plot, without Winky there is no Barty Crouch Jr. mystery. But these are just my own probs. with this movie. I was pleased to see that this movie made me laugh, somethings within the movie really will have you rolling. I loved Ron's attitude, and Hagrid's scenes too. I really don't think I could ever be mad at anyone's attempt to create a Harry Potter movie, at least the director tried and I can see how hard it must have been, ...I guess. I really wish they would have just made the movie 10 hours long, then none of the true Harry Potter fans would be upset. Oh well what's done is done, we just have to hope the director for Harry Potter 5 will read these comments and make the next movie better. I hope they do start making the movies 10 hours long, I think it would really be cool to see if someone could really sit that long.

They changed so much of the story so if you are looking for the books you will most likely want to walk out. Besides that the movie was extremely rushed jumping from scene to scene with no continuity. If you aren't going to do it right what is the point in even trying. The first two tasks are at least sort of like the book, but the third was the stupidest thing I have ever seen. It looked like the maze was just trying to eat them all. They left out the importance of the unforgivable curses and are turning the point of the movies to love stories. The love stories are supposed to be played down in the series cause they give nothing to the overall point of the story. The graveyard scene was the only part of the movie worth watching. ",0
331,9.0,"The book was one of the best and most intense in the series and while I think they left out too much the movie was still epic. Dumbledore bothered me the most. I mean, what? When did Dumbledore get so hyperactive? Where did that wise, calm Dumbledore go? But, about the ending, they totally nailed it! This ending is a big game-changer in the series and when you see why, you'll be shocked. After that, nothing is going to be the same again. It's gut-punching and also terrifying for children. But enough about the ending, you'll see it for yourself. CGI is great and now it really looks realistic. The dragon and underwater scenes were spectacular! And don't get me started on the maze. There are also some teen problems in this movie. Obviously, they are not kids anymore but it's really fun to see them grow up. The Yulle Ball part shows that the most. About the actors, I can only say something about the new ones because the others are great as usual (except Gambon who wasn't bad but over the top). Brendan Gleeson is great as Mad-Eye Moody. And David Tennat was scary in a good way. John Williams isn't the composer anymore but Patrick Doyle did such a great job in this one. While Williams' score was more magical, Doyle's was pure epicness and makes everything more intense. And Mike Newell, as a first British director in the franchise was great. While it could've been more faithful to the book (but then it would be really long) it's still awesome and epic.",1

335,6.0,"I recently saw the 4th Harry Potter movie and i must say i was disappointed. Though it was very entertaining to watch i felt it did the book no justice. Not only did they leave out a lot of information that was provided in the book, they changed many scenes as well. I know that this was necessary to fit the book into a 2 hour and 30 minute movie, but like i mentioned before i was disappointed. They changed the entire maze at the end of the movie, Harry's dreams regarding Lord Voldemort in the Riddle house, and even the entire situation regarding Mr. Crouch. Overall i feel that the Harry potter movies should begin to be filmed like Lord of the Rings. With the length of the books they should begin to film these movies at a duration of 2 hours and 59 minutes, as well as release an extended addition to explain more of the movie in detail. If i didn't read the books i would have loved the movie, but since i know all of the information that was changed and left out i can only give this movie 6 out of 10.",0

337,1.0,"One thing I'd recommend to every person who votes HP-4 as the best in the series, or anything but a disaster, would be to go back and watch it again or, more importantly, read the book at least few more times to get a sense of the story, characters and many other elements,... Dumbledore, Voldemort and... almost every other character in this film are portrayed as though the director had never read any of the Harry Potter books in his life. I watched the film only once and will never watch it again... unless, I really want to torture myself with a type of pain that any cruciatus curse would ever deliver to a tasteful person's mind. P.S. Most likely the worst Harry Potter movie ever!!!",0
338,3.0,"I'm mad sorry. but this movie was trash. i don't want to seem mean. but to make a movie based on a book which a gazillion read and then change the whole ruddy story isn't much of a good idea. personally, i was immensely disappointed with the fact that 3 important characters where missing, and not only that but around 20 scenes or so which will definitely effect the rest of the movies weren't there. where was bagman? dammit guys, he is a big part? ooorr winky? she basically sets the base on the point of the movie at the quidditch world cup! and dobbie!! where is he? smoking? he jacked the gilliweed not neville! sigh...

340,10.0,"Well I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and I read GoF probably 6 times before this came out. Overall this was a great movie. There were many things I loved about this movie. For Voldemort, Mad-Eye Moody, Cho Chang, and Cedric Diggory, they picked extraordinary actors, they were exactly like I had imagined them. Even though it wasn't in the book, the scene with Ron and Professor McGonagall dancing was very funny. I loved the scenes with the 3 tasks, they were done exceptionally well and they were great! But in contrast to the things I liked, there were also some things I didn't like. For example: The beginning was very confusing to people who haven't read the book. They don't know who the old man was (the old man was Frank Bryce by the way, the Riddle family's gardener, but the Riddles had been mysteriously killed, and Frank Bryce now looked after the house). They also changed the whole Quidditch World Cup scene to where almost nothing happened like it should have, and the house elves were completely cut out! But they couldn't put in everything! For how long GoF is (734 pages I think, not 100% sure, that number is off the top of my head) they did awesome and I give it a 10!",1
341,5.0,This fourth movie presents almost totally new genre in Harry Potter -movies. This ain't any more a recollection of the events taking place during the WHOLE year. Movie itself is a very good one but it concentrates way too much on the competition leaving behind all too many characters and incidents. I read somewhere that there were plans to make the fourth book into two films. Why on earth they didn't!?! This is no longer a Harry Potter -film if you compare it to the first three; This is a film of Harry Potter's one adventure - as if someday there would be films called 'Hermione Granger and The Decline of Dobby' or 'Doing Time With The Dursleys',0

347,6.0,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is film number 4 in the series and probably my 3rd favorite. Films number 1 and 3 are still better I believe. It is directed by Mike Newell (""Donnie Brasco"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), the only film by him just like with Cuarón previously. It's adapted by Steve Kloves as usual from Joanne K. Rowling's novel. The film was Oscar-nominated for its art direction and it is the first movie that does not start at Potter's home with his aunt and uncle.",1
348,9.0,"First let me say that I have read all the Harry Potter books. I am not biased as far as the movies go because that is a totally different deal. Watching the film though, I felt as if I was watching it in fast forward. The film felt rushed. I understand that there is quite a bit of material in the book to sort through and bring to life in a film but had I not read the books I would have been totally confused as to how to follow it. I brought along with me to the theater an assortment of friends and some have read the books and some have not. Those who had not could not follow along at the pace of the movie and kept asking me questions throughout it. Some who had were still totally confused. I liked the look of the film, was blown away by it actually and the special effects as well but as far as the storyline goes, it felt rushed through. Thats why I gave it only an 8 because I felt they could have done a bit better. I'll have to see it again though to pick up anything I missed.",0
349,8.0,"I miss Dumbledore. Whether he was the first or the better the movies are not the same without Richard Harris as Dumbledore. The twists in the screenplays are upsetting. Just leave it out if you feel you have to change it. When was Barty Krouch ever with Voldermort at the old Riddle house? When did Neville get so smart that he coached Harry? I must admit that the action sequences in the tri-wizard tournament were very well done and looked very real. This Movie was definitely not as bad as ""prisoner Of Azkerban"". I guess it's hard to make those choices to decide what goes and what stays and you mind gets cluttered and you put some of your own stuff in since you bought the rights anyway.",1

351,9.0,"Let's start off by saying it is not the book. No movie ever will be able to contain all of the glory and wonder of a book, particularly J.K. Rowling's wonderful literary gems. What is managed in the movie, and I would say more so in this than the previous three, is all of the essences of the story are present, even if a great deal of the text is cut.",0
352,10.0,"I saw The Goblet of Fire on Friday, and I will most assuredly see it again before the week is out. I was very impressed with how the director and producer kept the movie very close to the book, though they did have to change a few things (those who have seen it and read the books know what I'm talking about). I eagerly await the next installment. I think what really made it nice for me was the fact that Quidditch was finally back in the movie! Yes, it wasn't for very long, but it was there nevertheless, and that was one of my main complaints about Prisoner of Azkaban. And lets not forget the fact that Hamish from Braveheart is Professor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody; that made my day right there.",1
353,5.0,"I mean, these books are so crammed full of character and incident, how can they possibly be adapted to a two or two and a half hour film? I think the screenwriters did a better job with the last film--I never felt lost or saw gaping plot holes. This time, there's so much stuff that needs to be introduced and new characters to take the stage, that it just feels rushed and incomplete somehow. The whole first hour or so is primarily exposition and is so sketchy that those who aren't intimately familiar with the books might be lost. The movie takes too long to get going and when it finally does warm up and get exciting, blink, and it's over. I'm not one of those purists that thinks every little incident and character mentioned in the books has to be translated to the screen, but I think they might have tried to do too much this time out. We've got a very busy movie that doesn't really have a strong narrative arc leading through it. Again, I much preferred Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to this muddled mess, though it does have its strengths, notably Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Next time out, they're going to really have to work harder on a screenplay that streamlines and clarifies the story, or else they're going to have to go the other direction and give us a three-hour movie.",0

However, as I sat down in the theater and the events of the movie transpired, I closed my eyes for a few seconds following the initial scene at the Riddle Mansion. All of a sudden the film is at the Quidditch World Cup.... what? This is the main shortfall of the film - it is rushed, relies far too much on tacky transition devices, and feels overall like a chick flick, not at all congruent with the darkness of the third film. The film rushes from Harry's dream to the Quidditch World Cup, completely bypassing the Dursleys.... okay that much I suppose I can understand, it's a slightly tedious and unnecessary event... but then the Quidditch World cup is shown within the span of two minutes. What the hell's the point of even introducing it then? All of a sudden the entire camp of wizards is obliterated by people looking like the KKK (uh, those are the Death Eaters, I suppose?) and are only alluded to by a barely mumbled line from Arthur Weasley... the whole subplot of the elf Winky is left completely out, thereby basically ruining the whole point of the twist later on. Oh, not to mention, the Dark Mark is fired up in the air when nobody's around on the camp grounds. Way to forget the bloody point of the Mark, Kloves.",0

I really loved the other movies so i was totally disappointed when i saw this latest one.There really isn't any one thing i didn't like...it was a whole bunch of crap all rolled into one to make this a stinker...ah well lucky for the franchise there are more to come to help forget this one. Apparently i need to write more lines...so what else can i crap on for this horrible movie. Acting was terrible all round... those twin guys are about as cheesy as they come...,0
361,7.0,"While I did enjoy the movie it did the book no justice. There were 5 major characters who were almost completely left out of the movie, there was no lead in at the end for the next movie, they tied up no loose ends, and excuse me by why are the Weasley twins in classes with Harry, Ron and Hermione? There were so many things that they could have done better that would have only taken moments... and although it added humor the dance lesson with Professor McGonagall was completely unnecessary... I was extremely disappointed with this movie by the end. I'm glad I saw it because it is still after all a Harry Potter movie... and I guess if you've never read the books it was probably a really great movie with a really great story but for someone who knows what happens all the twists and turns of the book this movie really left something to be desired... I don't feel it did Rowling justice... I really don't especially compared to the first 3.",1
362,6.0,"I love the Harry Potter series and was excited after reading all the positive reviews after the premier. Unfortunately this movie is a dud. It was so choppy in it's presentation of the book, and I can't fathom any reason for some of the ridiculous, time consuming, changes they made. The Dragon/Golden Egg contest of the TriWizard Tournament was just lunacy with the changes made. All the cool computer graphics and the mashed together scenes left very little room for getting to know the characters and develop them further (other than as action heroes). The best part of Prisoner of Azkaban was the character development and storyline. GoF is almost entirely short visual scenes, very little dialog and a fast paced action. The flow was definitely and problem and I hope they don't use director Newell again. They should also fire the screenwriter. The only upside is getting to see some of the scenes from the book acted out. If you are a HP fan then you can't help but enjoy the film, however it's disjointed-ness and odd changes from the book will leave you feeling cheated out of what should have been a much better picture. The ending was poorly done as well, the director/screenwriter just couldn't seem to capture the same mood that existed at the end of the book and instead decided to make changes that left you feeling like you hadn't heeded the warning label on your allergy medicine.",0
363,8.0,"I saw the movie last night and it deserves being watched. I really enjoy the film as a H.P. fan. However, this film is really hard to understand for people who haven't read the fourth book, so if you haven't read the book you most probably won't like this movie.. for readers it's just another fun and a new question: ""How will be the next film?"" On the other hand, Mike Newell couldn't improve the quality of the film as much as Alfonso Cuaron did. I think that the directors' understanding of the characters were quite different from the book; especially Dumbuldore was seemed to be were angry and excited unlike the book in which he was usually calm. My other disappointment about the film is the final of the film. The scenes in which Voldemort appears lacks being scary and exciting especially when compared with the scenes full of Dementors in the third film. In short surely a wonderful movie for readers but for others???",0
364,1.0,"I understand when you need to squeeze a book into a 2hr film, you have to change things, such as trimming details and simplifying the plot.

In Prisoner of Azkaban I felt that Dumbledore's performance was uninspired at best, in Goblet of Fire he was hyperactive, constantly seeming weak and deferring judgment on important matters to others.. I feel as though Richard Harris was far better because he played the role in a way that oozed confidence. I felt as though he was in control of every situation and would allow it to play out as it would with the confidence that good would prevail. In a word, he was wise. Wisdom that comes from experience. The actor who plays Dumbledore now does not convey the confidence or control that I feel Dumbledore (as portrayed in the books and in my mind) possesses. Richard Harris was a Dumbledore that was as constant and steady as the North Star, this Dumbledore seems more like a weak and fragile old man who doubts himself and his abilities.",0
367,4.0,"First, let me say I understand that it is impossible to make any book into a movie without bending the storyline(s) and/or reducing subplots. This is especially true for books as complex as the Harry Potter series, and I think the director -or whoever makes those decisions- did a fairly good job stripping the ""Goblet of Fire"".",1
368,9.0,"This is a simple situation of J.K. Rowling having written more than could be squeezed into the movie. I personally was rather looking forward to seeing the Quidditch World Cup and the full opening ceremonies and was quite disappointed that it felt as if the first 6 chapters went by in a matter of a minute and half. More so than in any of the earlier Harry Potter movies, you really needed to see this movie after having read the book otherwise you may find yourself lost at various times through out the movie.",0
369,5.0,"After a brief respite of cinematic respectability with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", the Harry Potter series is back squarely in the well-traversed realm of pointless over-the-top special effects and achingly obvious character development. The third film in the series had lifted it from the drek, had made something special out of this series. I have to admit I have not read the books, I don't know if the quality of the books follows the quality of the films in any way. But I do think with this story, ""Goblet of Fire"" could have been much better, more substantial in some ways. For instance, it doesn't seem to know what to do with Ron and Hermione. They pop up every once in a while mainly as distractions to Harry's quest. There is a too lengthy sequence involving a ball-room dance (yes, there really is) and then we don't see them for what seems like a half hour.",0
370,5.0,"I am one of those people that has read all the books too many times to count, so I suppose I have an eye for things they may leave out. Although this was my personal favorite of all the films, it definitely was NOT because it was faithful to the book. The special effects, the acting, and the script was probably the best out of all four films, but it was the least faithful to the series we all know and love. Yes, I cried when Cedric died, and I was freaked out when Voldemort was revived, but through the whole movie, I felt myself thinking, ""Oh my god, I can't believe they completely cut Winky the House Elf from the entire movie!"" or ""Okay... if I had NOT read the book, I would be confused out of my mind right now..."" They cut so may important events from the story, and so many vital facts, that most people leaving the theater (that obviously hadn't read the book) were heard saying, ""So wait, what was with that one scene? It didn't make any sense."" And many of the things that were explained, were very discrete, and were hardly noticeable because of the speed of the dialog, or the tone of voice. Also, they attempted to condense a 734 page book into two and a half hours, making the movie seem too choppy. I know at one point the director was considering cutting it into two films, and making it have two parts. I think that was a much better idea; it would have made it flow through better, and seem more natural. I think that later in the series, they will look back at what they left out and realize that people will have to use the former films as references for future occurrences. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is probably the most important book to the series, because of the many proceedings that lead to important events in the future books, and it certainly didn't seem that way by the look and feel of the film. That is why I only gave the film five stars out of 10.",0
371,7.0,"I have to say, this movie was not how I expected. It was so fragmented! They left out so many things that I really would have liked to see. The acting was terrible (especially on Emma Watson's part.) She was such a spaz! Can you say 'overacting'? I would say that Ron Weasley did a really good job of acting though. I think he was the best of the 3. If you are expecting this movie to be fun and good for kids, you might try thinking again. Voldemort was so evil looking, and ran and acted so evil. It was quite eerie. And the death eaters were pretty scary too. But for the most part, it wasn't especially scary. It was just that part with voldemort (which lasted about 15 minutes) and the part with the death eaters which only last a few minutes. I have a bone to pick with the fact that so much of the book was left out. (((***SPOILER***)))they didn't show ANY of the World Cup tournament! I mean, come on! We all wanted to see that, did we not? Yeah, sure, they show them getting all seated and cheered up for the quidditch match, but then, just as the competition began, the freaking scene ended! They didn't show it! (((***SPOILER***))) Also, they didn't even show Cedric Diggory's funeral! COME ONE PEOPLE!!! UGH!!!!!!!!! Anyways. Yes, I am over being mela-dramatic. :-) But anyway, it was pretty good for the most part, just ridiculously fragmented. Don't see it if you get scared easily though. It's pretty dark.",1

The essence of 'teenager' distilled perfectly, minus the spots....did they get CGFX'd out? I can't believe they ALL had perfect skin. Loved the Phelps twins, the true Fred and George, Very good.

The special effects were amazing as usual, but they cut out WAY too many crucial elements to the story line...They changed WAY too much. I realize that many things need to change from book to movie but...These changes were just pathetic. Not to mention the fact that this Dumbledore is HORRIBLE! I realize that there will never be another Richard Harris, but...Is there No one that can see the vision of Albus Dumbledore as he did? As Mrs Rowling has written him?

376,10.0,"Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. It's definitely on my top 5 films of the year list. Having never read the book I just went into the film and took it for what it was. My wife on the other hand has read all the books and was saying that this book which the film is based on wasn't very good. So I guess my expectations were not to high. I was wrong. This is the best Potter film yet. It's funny, exciting, well written, well acted, and sometimes just down right creepy. This time around Harry is entered in a tournament that his school, Hogwarts is hosting called The Tri-Wizard Tournament. This is a dangerous tournament, that even the best and brightest wizards that attended Hogwarts have lost their lives in. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is terrified as well as his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Herminee (Emma Watson). Harry enters the tournament an extreme underdog. Goblet Of Fire is just fun, plain and simple. The movie is awesome. We also get to see what big budget CGI looks like when it's done right. Something George Lucas should have done when releasing the new Star Wars films. The Harry Potter films are everything and more than these new Star Wars films should have been. Don't get me wrong I loved Revenge Of The Sith but Phantom Menace was terrible and Attack Of The Clones, though better when I've seen it again, still lacks in quality. The Potter films have everything the original trilogy had. Character development and a great story. When Harry is fighting for his life against a deadly dragon you feel scared for him. When Herminee yells at Ron you feel mad at Ron as well. When Ron feels dumb for doing something idiotic you feel embarrassed for him. This is what made the original Star Wars trilogy characters great, and the same formula goes into the Harry Potter films. That's what makes them classics. The only issue the films can run into is the three main characters aren't getting any younger, and this could pose a problem. In January they begin filming the 5th movie Harry Potter And The Order Of The Pheonix. I imagine the filming of the 6th film Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince will begin shortly after that. J.K. Rowling has begun writing the 7th and final novel in the series, so that should be adapted to the screen rather quickly. I just hope it doesn't get rushed, but in the same vein I don't want to see anyone else play Harry, Herminee, or Ron. Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. Once again a wonderful world of imagination comes to life before your eyes. These films will be held in the same light as the original Star Wars trilogy. Just great, great, movie making. On a scale of 10 I give Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire a 10. This film, unlike the last 3 is rated PG-13, and it deserves it rating. It's much darker and could scare little kids. The tag line to the film is ""Everything Is About To Change."" Yes it is and believe me folks when I say, Change is good.",1

379,3.0,"I would like to personally thank the director for ruining arguably the best Harry Potter book and making it into not only the worst movie of the series, but a pretty awful movie in general. By eliminating essential plot points and characters, such as house-elves and Mrs. Weasley, we miss the intricate world that JK Rowling created. This film has been reduced to merely the three competitions of the tournament and the rise of Lord Voldemort. We miss out on the richness of the characters and their relationships. Harry's friendship with the Weasley family is one of the most touching aspects of the series and it grows to become an essential part of Harry's character as he discovers that he can create his own family to draw strength from. Plus leaving Sirius out almost completely reduces his importance as well, and has ruined a great deal of set up for the fifth installment. Additionally, I just find it offensive to Rowling's fans to completely change the plot of Goblet of Fire. The ending of Goblet of Fire is completely surprising, and the film maker has changed it to be completely predictable by introducing characters at inappropriate times and eliminating others. The mystery in Goblet of Fire is completely absent from the movie. Albeit, the humor in this movie is enjoyable, but I'd rather the director not have included his fabricated dance scene and stay truer to the book. The editing and timing of this movie was choppy. Most of the scenes were extremely cheesy, I was laughing during the dragon battle rather than worrying about Harry. Also, the degree to which the characters were portrayed inaccurately was painful. The movie was reduced to mere events and no overall plot. Overall, this film was a huge disappointment and I left the theater wishing they could remake it to be true to the book.",0

I know fans were divided on ""POA"" and I was definitely in the ""hated it"" camp with the reason being how many important elements were left out, and not just nitpicking little items but key ingredients.

381,9.0,"After the third movie, I thought the fourth won't match up to it. But, lo and behold, it was, in my opinion, the best Harry Potter adaptation yet. It was faithful to the text most of the time, which is great because it gives the other people (who haven't read the book) the opportunity to watch and understand it based on the real story. It is fantastic how the movie people were able to add humor and romance to it. The visual effects were AWESOME. I, as a reader, couldn't imagine it any less than the effects they showed on screen. It was a little disappointing, though, that the Quidditch World Cup wasn't shown fully. But the presentation of the leprechauns (of the Ireland team) was enchanting! (too bad they weren't able to show the performance of the veelas). I was also a bit sad that they didn't show Bagman and all the other important characters (like Dobby and Winky) although I commend the cast for their excellent acting. They are indeed growing up (Radcliffe, Watson, Grint, and the others) however they still are the perfect actors for the characters of Harry, Hermione and Ron. No one can do it like they can. Cheers to another great Harry Potter movie! Hats off to the actors and to the people who worked behind the scenes, you've done a marvelous job. Overall, it was a movie definitely worth watching and would be an outrage to miss.",1
382,10.0,"I am sure that it was very hard to take a 735 page book and turn it into a movie, but in my opinion they did an outstanding job. They did have to cut some parts, but they left in the important things.",1
383,5.0,"One of the greatest successes of the series (a term that I think is more appropriate than Harry Potter's hackneyed and bombastic saga) is that it ""grows"" along with its potential readers. That is to say, a supposed model reader who with 10 years old read the first book in 1997, would read the last one with 20 years. And that tender infant that vibrated with the antics of Potter and his friends has grown up and has learned that in the world there is terrorism and war, love and sex, differences and injustices; therefore, one of the great merits of J. K. Rowling is that his series moves from the carelessness of childhood to increasingly mature and rugged issues.",1
384,4.0,"What was Mike Newell thinking when he turned down the original idea of having two long films for this book? This one, despite its wonderful performances by Gleeson and Fiennes and yes, at last, even Radcliffe, is a dismal failure. And it's all at the feet of the director who chose to leave out many scenes which were important to the next book, and a few that were important even to this one.",0
385,7.0,Honestly?,0
386,7.0,"I'm in two minds about his film... I thought it was rather good in places (e.g, the bathroom scene with Moaning Myrtle, it was great to see her again!), but it did have a few terrible bits (e.g, the Goblet of Fire, I mean, come on Newall, it's meant to be similar to the Holy Grail, a 'roughly hewn wooden cup', not some random antique chalice!). Having said that, the Phelps twins did pull of some spectacular acting, as did Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the others...except Emma Watson... I feel her acting has suddenly deteriorated (her 'Ron, you spoilt everything!' scene was a over-dramatic and whiny... Not exactly the way one would expect Hermione Granger to behave...). Michael Gambon irritated me in this film; Dumbledore wouldn't treat Harry the way he does in this movie... I was also disappointed with Ludo Bagmans disappearance... but David Tennant redeemed the film a little with his wonderful performance as Barty Crouch Jr. All in all, I think this movie is fair, almost the same quality as the second, outstripping the third by far (I didn't really like the way the director created that one...), and a generally good film.",1
387,6.0,"I'd have to say, if you haven't read the book don't go and see it. It misses out so many crucial details that if you don't already know the story you will be completely lost and confused. New characters that are prominent in the book are given their own scene to be set up in honour of the original story but only appear for about 5 seconds in the rest of the film (Rita Skeeter as an example).",0
388,8.0,This movie was actually not that bad. I thought it would be the same like the third one but its not. good thing they changed the director.,0
389,6.0,"This latest installment of Harry Potter was a bit of a letdown. First off let me declare that I have never read any of the books (and probably never will; I have more important things to read). I also never read Lord of The Rings either. The point being that I don't think it's necessary to read any books that have been transferred to the big screen. A movie should be able to stand on its own. The first three films were quite engrossing with all the special effects and intriguing characters but this one shifted focus too much between former and new characters. The threat of Voldermort returns yet again and it's getting pretty old. Harry Potter still has no composure whilst Ron is just as idiotic as he's always been. Hermoine is growing up but there's too little focus on her. Some parts of the movie were quite difficult to understand too. I get the impression they think we would have or perhaps should later buy and read the book. I don't really have a problem with these kids growing up on screen and don't believe it's the reason why this movie was not as interesting as its predecessors. The reason it wasn't as good is probably because too many scenes are wasted on trivial matters instead of developing characters and good dialog. In a way, it's similar to the new Spider-man movies where he just can't decide what he wants to be and takes the 'good guy' thing too far. Harry better shape up and get something going on with Hermoine in the next film. And they should kill off Ron in the next movie.",0
390,3.0,"The first two Harry Potter films were and are ENCHANTINGLY MAGICAL! Although a little rough on the special effects, they greatly improve from the first the the second films. The third movie, Pisoner of Azkaban, was a much darker film, and lost some of the luster and magic. It even had some evil connotations that were not in the book and should not have been in the movie, shrunken heads, spinal-column candle sticks!!!......Not what I would have expected from Hogwarts.....The extremely poor recasting of the HeadMaster Dumbledore further dragged the movie down (even given that Richard Harris is a hard act to follow)....... Even so the third movie worked and was enjoyable to watch.",0
391,10.0,"Acknowledging first that I am a big fan of all three other _Harry Potter_ films to date, I strongly believe this is the very best of the lot. While I do miss the house elves, seeing Harry's 'family' in the Muggle world, and many other interesting details, characters, and scenes that weren't adapted from Rowling's fourth book, I feel the director and screenwriter did an admirable job of pulling hundreds of pages of text into a movie less than 2 1/2 hours. Beyond that, the action scenes, such as the extended version of Harry outsmarting the dragon in the movie, are wonderfully constructed and shot. And the amazing foreboding of the climatic scene in the graveyard leads to a masterful translation of that quintessential moment in Harry's life: he finally gets to 'speak' to his loving parents but only a point when his life is at its greatest risk, when he doesn't even get to say goodbye again in the swirl of light and darkness. The young actors are getting better ever time out and their supporting cast keeps adding more talented actors. This is an all time great adventure fantasy film.",1
392,1.0,"IT WAS HORRIBLE. MY GOD...MISERABLE!!! it was the most pathetically terrible movie I have ever seen in my life. The director and screen play writers deserve to stripped of their position, and disgraced, tarred and feathered in public, shunned for their miserable ideas. They have forever made themselves pathetic in my eyes. I HATED IT. Dumbledore had a temper and yelled at harry, ruined his personality. There was no dobby or winkey, no weasly family except for those at school, no ludo baggman, and they didn't explain anything, it went from one thing to another without explaining anything. IT SUCKED!!!!!! They missed the bulls eye by a infinite amount.",0
393,8.0,"I saw this at 10.00am on the Friday morning of the 18th November and was so excited beforehand! And to be honest, I don't think I was disappointed. I thought the film was fantastic, and certainly the best one yet.",1

396,8.0,"OK. I'm a Harry Potter fan, nevertheless, I'm a fan of good cinema, so unlike most of the reviews here(who are either biased pro-Harry or biased against it) I will be as merciless & objective as I can. Here we go.",1
397,9.0,"Everyone, this is the best Harry Potter yet. Everything you want, there's more of. You have to be focused to understand some of the narrative, but it all pays off. The Goblet of Fire is easily the most intense and most involving of all the films yet and I, personally, do not envy the director of the next film. What makes this film greater than the others is that Harry tackles everything in this film. From his friends, to relationships, and to his greatest fears, Harry's screwed at from all sides. I would be surprised if you, as a Harry Potter fan, did not enjoy this excellent film.",1
398,10.0,"This is definitely the best movie. Not just out of all three Harry Potters, but one of the best movies I have seen. It is good because not only are the actors better and more skilled at acting, but they are starting to become actual good at acting their parts. Not that they weren't before, but they are a lot better at it now. It was sad at many parts and I admit that I did cry. It was scary as well to see Lord Voldemort and his evilness being brought upon Harry. It was very funny as well, the funniest one yet. It was interesting to see the characters starting to like other girls and boys. It added to the all around goodness of the movie. Although it wasn't exactly like the book and they left out many parts and altered others, it was still very good. Try not to be disappointed, those of you who like the book to be exactly like the movie. But if you have never read the book, you would be puzzled and you would be even more puzzled if you hadn't seen the other movies. I overall think that this was one of my all time favorites and I can't wait to see it again. It is a must see to many people. Those who are Harry Potter fans and those who are not.",1
399,10.0,"I have seen all 4 of the Harry Potter movies, and they keep getting better and better. By far, this one is the best. You may already know the story, but for those who don't here it goes: Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament. He doesn't know who entered him, so he just faces the tasks at hand. I won't go any further. The special effects were dazzling, and the story was just perfect. Potter fans everywhere will enjoy this film. I can't wait for the next movie in 2007. It may be a long wait, but it will be totally worth it. This is the first Potter movie that has gotten a PG-13 rating, and I can see why. Kids younger than 10 may find some scenes too scary. So parents, take your older children to see this new film, and enjoy it!",1
400,6.0,I loved the first three Harry Potter movies and have been looking forward to The Goblet of Fire. But this movie wasted some great material. For instance...the arrival of the ship and the flying carriage with no warning or subsequent explanation. My wife had to ask me what they were for! It seemed like most of the dialog was shouted and rushed. There was almost no character development and little interaction.,0
401,4.0,"This film deserved its mediocre ratings. This film is horrible from a production stand point, a music stand point, and acting stand point, a writing stand point, a directing stand point.",0
402,8.0,"This was the first Harry Potter film to be rated 12, it is certainly much darker than the previous three films as well, so the adults will be just as captivated as the younger audience members. Basically the fourth year at Hogwarts is going to start, but before this Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Weasley family, go to the Quidditch World Cup, but of course Harry is not safe there as dark forces are nearby. When the three friends return to school, they find out that it has been chosen to hold and host the The Triwizard Tournament, a big event tournament where three magic schools compete against each other, Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. All contestants who take part must be over seventeen years old, and it is usually three names that are spewed out, chosen from all the names in the Goblet of Fire, but Harry is shocked to have been chosen as a fourth champion. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) says he has no choice but to take part regardless of his age, facing the three difficult challenges to play, Ron thinks he wants the attention the tournament brings so refuses to talk to him. The first tasks sees the players facing a chosen fire breathing dragon in a rocky arena, and they must retrieve an egg it is protecting, this egg will also contain a clue for the next challenge. In amongst the tasks, meeting new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher Professor Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Ron knowing his jealousy was wrong and apologising to Harry, the three friends and the other three champions, including Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), attend the annual Triwizard Yule Ball held on Christmas Eve. The second task sees the players have to swim is the Black Lake to save ""something precious"" submerged under the water, Harry gets some Gillyweed to breathe and grow fins underwater, he comes second in this game. The final task sees the players have to travel through a giant hedge maze, many of the walls collapsing around them, and the person who gets to the middle has to retrieve and win the Triwizard Cup. However when Harry gets there, he encounters not just the cup, but he faces with old enemies Peter Pettigrew aka Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), but also a baby creature grows into an adult Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), and kills Cedric Diggory. In the end, Harry escapes Voldermort and near death, and he is really upset to have his friend Diggory dead, and have to announce to everyone that the Dark Lord is back, so there will be dark times ahead. Also starring Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape, Dame Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack as Bartemius 'Barty' Crouch, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, David Tennant as Bartemius 'Barty' Crouch Jr., Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle, Robert Hardy as Corenlius Fudge, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, Jarvis Cocker as Band Lead Singer, Adrian Rawlins as James Potter, Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Eric Sykes as Frank Bryce, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley and The X Factor's Paije Richardson as DA member / extra. The acting as before is good and reliable, the story is near enough straight forward, and of course the biggest star, the special effects and action, is fantastic, I said once that this was the darkest film of the lot, I still sort of stick by that, but it is an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Art Direction, and it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Make Up/Hair. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!",1
403,10.0,"This movie was killer. I know that there are people out there that get all agitated because certain things get cut out and whatnot. But that doesn't make the movie any more or less good. This movie was the best on thus far. In fact, they only get better with each one. The first two were good, but they were very kiddie-friendly. With the characters becoming teenagers, the stories have matured and become darker. Yes, there are things that are cut out, but this will always be so. If you've read the book, forget all about it while watching the film. Just view the film as if you had never heard it before. You will find that it is a remarkable film. The characters are as dimensional as they need to be. The story is told well. And who really cares if Dumbledore shakes Harry. It's not in my character to shake people, but if it were me, I would have beat Harry down. Yes, it's out of character, but it's not out of the question. This film is great. Go see it if you haven't already. If you have, go see it again. If you have read the book and keep comparing it to he book, go back and see it over and over until you can view it without comparing it to the book at all. You will find that this is one of the best films of 2005. Now I can't wait for OotP.",1
404,4.0,"This is the film I was worried that ""The Two Towers"" was going to be. Amazingly long, overdrawn at the drama bank and without a parcel of sense in the pacing department, this film hobbles along on the crutch of great visual effects, and its name brand.",1
405,3.0,"If you read the book, prepared to be disappointed. The movie was 2-1/2 hours compared to the previous 3-1/2-4 hour Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban and the book was twice the size of any of these books. They left out more of the story than they put in. This was like buying a Porsche and not getting the body. There will be people that will like the movie, probably because they never read the book. They were slim on effects. They must have really had a tight budget to leave so much out. Some of the previous films were so detailed, they were like heavy Cream, but Goblet was like was like Skim Milk, white water. Maybe Warner's has decided that the Harry Potter films are no longer a good franchise to invest in. I wonder what J. K. Rowling really thought of this one. Probably only her close friends and family will know.",0
406,5.0,"First, let me confess that I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, so my perspective on the movies is entirely based on the movies as they stand on their own. I've seen all the movies, though, and this was the first I felt was disappointing. Granted, I don't know to what extent the problems were in the book and to what extent they are problems in the film, but here are my thoughts:",0
407,5.0,"This one had its moments, but almost nothing was explained, and I'm of the opinion that shearing unnecessary plot points entirely is a much better idea than leaving in just enough to satisfy the readers, because by splitting the middle you please no one. I haven't read the books, (before it is suggested I should tell you that I have absolutely no inclination of ever doing so) and it seemed to me that the filmmakers took it for granted that everyone in the audience had read them. Film and literature are different mediums and books and movies must each stand on their own, so in this respect particularly the film was a failure. The movie was overly long and yet there were a ton of plot holes, which are almost mutually exclusive problems in general; it felt both rushed and run down at the same time. This is a shame following on the heels of the last entry in the series which was an excellent piece of juvenile fantasy, no doubt owed to director Alfonso Cuaron, who directed A Little Princess, which is one of the single greatest children's films ever. He was a natural choice for the material. Mike Newell's only asset seems to be that he is British. While he did direct Four Weddings and a Funeral, everybody seems to forget that he also directed Pushing Tin and Mona Lisa Smile and a half dozen other real duds. Spielberg had expressed interest in directing this entry, and his offer was declined. Say what you will about Spielberg, but the guy knows how direct juvenile fantasy films better than just about anyone on the planet. I think they bungled it on this one. I didn't hate the film, but I was severely disappointed as the subject matter could have touched on a myriad of important life lessons, but came off like a soap opera for kids, composed of hackneyed ideas, snail paced and missing footage. I'm sure most will disagree, as this is a series of films that lures sycophants like pollen does bees. I say the emperor wears no clothes. I'll go see the next one probably, but I hope that they get the right director for the material, and they hire a continuity person who has not read the book, and allow that person to sit with the editor thus allowing for a truly objective eye to uphold the integrity of the piece.",0
408,4.0,"The short and long of it... Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Should be called Harry Potter and the Next in a line of movies that are too long especially for a sequel-sequel. No way should anyone have to watch this movie this long. Acting was decent, however the scene stealer doesn't speak (you'll see). Special Effects are good-enough to keep you from walking out. Liking this movie hinges on details from the book(hope you read it) and how you relate them. One of the movies hopefully intended successes- it reminded me of everything I hated about being a fourteen year old boy. Don't worry if you're over fourteen and female it will remind you of everything you hated about being a fourteen year old girl. Nevertheless, I have seen much worse and paid more to see it. My suggestion wait until 2008 and watch parts three,four,and 2007's part five on DVD at home where you can take solace in the fact that you are no longer fourteen.",0
409,6.0,"Judging by some of the reviews here you'd think this was a masterpiece though to be fair others tell it like it is. And I am coming to it cold without having read the book. There are good moments, especially the first half hour and the first contest but then the film flags dreadfully and never really recovers. Not only is each contest less exciting than the one before but there is an interminable sequence around the school ball which hammers the same point time after time after time: yes teenagers suffer social embarrassment and yes so do older folk but we don't need huge swathes of repetitive screen time to learn this again and again plus endless scenes of clichéd whimsy. This whole section could have come down to 10 minutes max (it feels like five time that length) and left more time for the story which is often confused and suffers weird time jumps.",1
410,7.0,"Although the pace of the movie seemed a bit too fast, I guess it was actually difficult to condense the 636 page book into a 150 minute movie. The graphics used were excellent, and seemed quite realistic. I felt it was a good movie for the one who's read the book, and had a background (seen the previous movies). If not, he/she's gonna have a tough time trying to grasp whatever's shown. The casting's also pretty decent, especially in the case of Cho Chang, Parvati/Padma Patil, Madame Maxime, and Rita Skeeter, and they've lived up to their characters. I was shocked at the non-inclusion of Winky, the elf, and also at the fact that Barty Crouch Jr. was shown conjuring the Dark Mark, when in the book, it has been kept as a secret. They've also not included even a hint of S.P.E.W, the House-Elf Liberation Front, the fact that it's Moody who saves Harry Potter from Snape's office and takes the Marauder's Map, and a lot more (for those who're wondering what all this is, go read the book). But again, it would've been next to impossible trying to include all this in a 150 minute movie. To sum up, it's a very good effort.",1
411,5.0,I along with some friends were really stoked about this movie coming out. We reserved tickets almost 2 weeks ahead of time for the opening weekend and choose the best theater in St. Louis we could to see it. This was a monumental book of the series and had a number of subtle plot threads and twists all the way throughout. A lot of these threads were snipped to keep the movie from running 3+ hours but so much was cut it was almost as if I were seeing a different story from the book.,1
412,9.0,"Wow, I loved the movie! It was so exciting and a real feat in terms of condensing things but making it still understandable to the audience. And I was thinking, yes! that was how Rowling should have done the book. The book contained a lot of flab-- it takes them how many pages to get to Hogwarts? As happens when a writer (director or anyone else) gets so successful they feel they don't have to listen to an editor. The Harry Potter and Cho thing was actually done much more believably in the movie. Lots of people told me the movie was really dark and scary but I actually think the last one was more disturbing with the Dementors. I actually found the filmed scene of the graveyard part not as disturbing as it was in the book. In the book Voldemort comes off as this gross bloody fetus thing and Wormtail hacking his arm off...I liked how it was down in a fairly non-freaky way in the movie. I still think Rowling kind of has trouble making the love stuff not come off cliché in the Potter books. I think Mike Newell did an excellent job with the actors. I've been keeping my eye on him since his early BBC stuff and he seems to strike the perfect balance in tone with the movie that I think works really well. Alan Rickman was absolute perfection as always of course! Loved the bathtub scene...heheh something for the girls at last and all the inuendo and humor. Definitely captured the humor of the books. (Too bad that element has been getting a little lost of late). The dark mark thing-- I always thought it would look more like a brand than a tattoo. The maze could have been cooler as well.",1
413,6.0,"After over a year of waiting and much publicity, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was one of the most anticipated films in recent history.

Fortunately for us, ""Goblet"" completely lives up to its hype.",1
414,3.0,"I must say that I was sorely disappointed with this film. As an interpretation of the book, I think it was a good idea to cut out any details that were superfluous to Harry's specific story. However, the script and, more to the point, the direction, is simply a random collection of unconnected events. As a result, this film is a choppy, disconnected and clumsy collection of snippets from the book. There is almost no continuity in this film. Important scenes have no buildup and seem to happen at random. The pace is constant, never allowing the movie to breathe, and, as a result, the underlying themes that are so important to the story never surface.",0
415,8.0,"When I saw this film with my family last night, I couldn't help feeling that I had already seen it. Unlike many film sequels, it doesn't leave me with the feeling that I've been handed a grab-bag of leftovers. It was well acted, with excellent special effects, and even having a horde of middle-schoolers wielding cell phones and darting back and forth to talk to one another in front of us didn't keep me from enjoying myself. I've just seen it already.",1
416,9.0,"Mike Newell is a great director and some of his movies really made me think good of him, but The Goblet of Fire is not one of them. He is the only little flaw of this movie, because he never loved Harry Potter as much as the other directors. He never read the books and it feels like he did not enjoy making The Goblet of Fire. Because of his directing, this movie made some major mistakes that triggered many fans who read the books. Still, basically every other element of the movie is a masterpiece, equally as the rest of the series. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is generally one of the best plots in the whole franchise, and the movie is made so good that it holds you focused the whole time. I enjoyed every single second of this masterpiece and I got impressed by the improvement of the acting of our main characters. Emma, Rupert and Daniel grew up a bit and this is the movie where they start taking their job way more seriously.",1
417,8.0,"Very entertaining. Yes, lots was missing from the book, but its not as if it diminished the major story line. The special effects were great and the humor in this one really helped. There were some scenes added that helped with the humor. If you expect the movie to be true to the book you will be disappointed, but for someone who has never read the books it would be great. Even if you have read the books, its a good movie, done very well. This movie has lots of good information, but you aren't bogged down with so much information as you are in the books. This one is much more entertaining than the last. It really holds its own.",1
418,8.0,I for one love the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling. I can't wait for the 7th book to come out! But I hate it when movies based on books do not measure up to the original. This movie however is an exception. Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed by this flick. ,0
419,5.0,"Admittdly, with my 41 years of age I am not the target group of watchers which is supposed to be addressed by this film. I am, nevertheless, fascinated by J.K.Rowlings novels, her incredible imagination and as a fanatic movie fan I also enjoyed the movies. I have to say, for me this is not the best movie of the series yet. It is certainly very hard to put on over-600-pages book into 2h 40 minutes film(I wouldn't have minded to stick around for 20 minutes longer) and that for certain things it had to be decided to leave them out for the greater good, but when I saw the movie for the first time I thought ""What is this....?"", especially the first half hour. I think is is very much o.k. for the film to get more ""adult"" as Harry and his friends do so too and I think it is very much o.k. for action scenes to be fast. Thats what they are there for. but all in all the pace of the movie is far to fast. the first 30 minutes are like ""O.K., we have to mention that and that and that.....o.k....done...next....!!! For someone who hasn't read the book it is very hard to follow at all. Except a few scenes it is all made as though everyone is in a constant hurry. Professor McGonogall and Professor Snape seem like puppets with only a few lines. The worst in Prof. Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect Dumbledore. Her was quite, mystifying and a total authority figure. Michael Gambon is constantly acting like a total fidget. The scene where he asks Harry is he really didn't put his name in the goblet, is disaster. I can only imagine how Richard Harris would have managed. There are hardly scenes in which you have a feeling of real characters and depth, which should be the case in a coming-of-age story, which the books are as well besides being a fantasy and adventure story. For me so far, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best one. I think it is really enchanting and magical and whatever the outcome of the last book, I do hope that Alfonso Cuaron does at least that one again",0

It has been a mammoth task for Mike Newell and his crew to put together a 500 page book into a 2.5 hrs long movie. And he performed the task admirably. Whereas the first movie, was pretty good, the second disastrous, the third being a good once but kept the hardcore book fans wanting for more, this one would surely fulfill everyone's needs. All the important parts including some well invited comic relief is included.",1

With ""Goblet of Fire"", I found myself confused, especially towards the end of the movie, because I did not know the significance of everything that was going on. I have had to seek out my nephew who knows all the books by heart to explain why something happened. I still enjoyed the movie, and I liked the darker tone of the film compared to the other 3 movies. I will have to either read the book or wait for the next movie to fill in some of the gaps. Maybe the fact that the book had a lot of subplots that needed to be cut out to fit into one movie took away from the cohesiveness of the film. So as a non-reader of the books (that is my loss), I give the movie a lower score.",1
424,2.0,The film was a complete disappointment. Below i have listed just some of the problems with it.,0
425,5.0,"This movie could have been great. It had amazing potential. But director Mike Newell squandered that potential and hacked this wonderful book to bits. Granted it is a huge tome and cuts were necessary, but the story could have been woven back together much more seamlessly in capable hands. Instead, it felt disjointed and rushed, almost as if Newell had a checklist: Quidditch World cup...check, Dragons...check, Voldemort...check. The imagery was fantastic and the world of Hogwarts is growing ever dark, as it should be. However, the characters seemed flat and devoid of any depth this time around. There was plenty of action but little emotion. The one bright (dark?) spot in this film is Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldemort. Perfectly evil and inhuman and sufficiently creepy, Fiennes did an excellent job. And the kids are getting better with each film. Unfortunately, all the talent in the world couldn't save this movie. As others have summed it up, great visuals, horrible content (or lack thereof, rather).",0

427,10.0,"As a graduate student in education, I have found Harry Potter to be excellent pieces of literature to utilize in the study of different topics featured in social studies. Not only does Harry Potter provide teachers with suitable material to teach about discrimination (Civil Rights Movement), slavery (The Civil War), and genocide (Holocaust), but he also allows children to digest lofty concepts that would have traditionally been left to the college professors and adults.",1
428,1.0,"I just saw this movie and it stank. For all of you HP book fans, save your money. The movie cuts out so much of the book, it is unbelievable. I understand that the whole book couldn't be in the movie, but they skipped a lot of the things that make the book great. Whole events are skipped right over. Certain exposures are left unexposed. For all of you people who have never read or seen a HP movie, don't let this be your first intro to the world of HP. The only good thing I can say about this movie was it's graphics- they are definitely getting better. I really don't have anything further to say but this database wont let me send this if its not a certain length.",0

430,7.0,"Well I have never considered myself a Harry Potter fan-at least not a ""real"" one. Up until a year ago-i wouldve equated by knowledge of Rowling's world with that of a muggle's.

Eventually I went on to read all of the Harry Potter Books and have found (despite the fact they're clearly wrriten at an easily accessible reading level) they are quite enjoyable stories.",1

433,2.0,I have seen all the Harry Potter movies that are out now. Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire was a Disappointment to say the least. I understand completely that they cannot put everything that is in the book in movie. But they could have at least not cut so much of the book out of the movie. They cut so much out of it that I had to go back to the book just to find out what was missing because it didn't fit together the way the scenes jumped around. The beginning of the movie left out why they were going to use a port key and where they were going. It just left him asking questions as to why they were doing anything they were doing. Didn't explain why Krum was such a big deal. Which is also at the beginning of the book.,0
434,6.0,"Harry Potter finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but he is distracted by recurring nightmares.",1
435,4.0,"This movie suffers because of some questionable choices. Thankfully, some of Newell's crazy ideas didn't make it into the film. His idea was to burn down the Forbidden Forrest during the First Task. Even though this stupid idea didn't make it into the film, the final version of the First Task was a disaster. They stated that Dragon Tamers were there to ensure safety of the Champions, yet they still thought it would be a great idea to let the dragon leave the arena to create an ""edge-of-our-seats"" experience. I couldn't help but cringe. And over the period of filming, Newell was complaining how he had to read the thickest book in the entire series, how it was hard to get through and so on. If you want to make a good adaptation, don't let people who don't have a deep connection with the series direct the movie! It's absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />Next, I had problems with how they portrayed Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. In the films, it looks like Beauxbatons is school only for witches, while Durmstrang is a boy school. This doesn't make any sense and I had a lot of questions which brought me out of the movie. ""Does this mean that French wizards have to go study to another country? Or is there another wizarding school in France specifically for wizards?""<br /><br />The Second Task was easily the best, but there were still some problems. I loved how they filmed this underwater. The entire Task was great, but after they had gone to the surface, I couldn't help but ask: ""So, the audience was just sitting there for the entire hour?"" Same goes for the Third Task. But this isn't only the filmmakers' fault, JK Rowling forgot about that part too.<br /><br />The books are liked by so many because they are magical mysteries. So, naturally, I didn't like the fact that they took this element out of the story. In the books, there were subtle clues that someone was impersonating Moody, while in the film, we knew this information by the halfway point.<br /><br />Now onto the Third Task. I was hoping to see the obstacles. Sphinx, Blast-Ended Screwts and many others. However, I was let down more than I thought possible. The only obstacle were hedges. Yes, that's right, hedges. That's not scary nor challenging! The Third Task was supposed to test the Champions in various ways to make sure the best one won. But here, it seemed very random and luck-based whether you found the Cup or not.<br /><br />Other than that, I had other complaints but this review is way too long for that. But I couldn't leave without mentioning the infamous line: ""Harry! Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?"" Dumbledore asked CALMLY.",0
436,5.0,"Let me begin by saying I haven't read any of the books, nor do I plan to, so I'm judging the film for what it is by itself. Basically, after having seen it twice, I remain unconvinced. It lacks the stylistic and narrative coherence of PoA, which remains easily the best of the 4 present HP movies. The first half of GoF in fact was a major disappointment: it seemed HP had fallen to the level of the next thirteen-in-a-dozen CGI action movie, and I expected Bruce Willis to turn op any moment. Sure, the special effects are more than a few notches up from the now endearingly clumsy efforts in part 1, but as we all know by now special effects alone don't make a movie. Fortunately, the second half is rather better. Beautiful imagery all through, and believable and touching emotions accompanying the much anticipated ""Death"". I wish, though, that Radcliffe and Watson would act with a little more spontaneity; maybe HP should stop clenching his jaws all the time? There is a lot of humor in GoF too, which in a way is nice, though incongruous at times. It's also a symptom of this movie trying to be too many things at once. The rock-band at the Xmas ball was one tongue in cheek joke too many, IMHO, and detracted from the believability of Hogwarts. Believability, on the whole, was my main problem with the film, and I suspect that may well be J.K. Rowling's fault rather than anyone else's. Of course the HP stories require ""suspension of disbelief"" - but that does not imply that all sense of logic and consistency can just be thrown overboard. Just a few of my niggles:",0
437,8.0,"Well, they certainly did their best. The effects were excellent, the actors delivered what was needed at the exact moment and it stayed semi-close to the book. Although many things were left out, I can't say that I was surprised, because the book is 734 pages long. That would probably make for a 12 hour movie. There are more things that they should have added, but even without Dobby and Ludo Bagman, it was very entertaining. However, i would recommend reading the book before viewing the movie so that you can understand what is going on during the movie. It will make the inner workings of the plot make more sense to you and help you enjoy it more. All together, i enjoyed the movie and hope everyone else does.",1
438,8.0,"This was a great movie. It managed to turn a 650 pages long book into a 2 and a half hour long movie, and it does so spectacularly.

440,10.0,"This film is truly remarkable. Fabulous clean edits, good use of colour, a brighter and more cheerful look than the last, but a dark story all the same. It deserves its 12a rating, as there are some scenes that even I found disturbing. Fiennes Voldemort is truly terrifying, but harder still it is to see Cedric Diggory die. Moving most of all is the scene in which Harrys parents come back to him in a beautiful vision, the moment at which my eyes watered! This film has everything- romance (cho was very well cast and Likable), edge of your seat thrills (the maze) and heart wrenching sadness. All the actors have come of age, including character Harmione who has stopped whining (appears that in this film, thats Rons job). JK will be delighted to see the book so well framed, but a word of warning to fans of the literary Potter- there's no Hogsmeade and very little Sirius... for he is star of the next movie. This installment of the saga will go down as the greatest, mark my words. Simply beautiful.",1

Maybe I had high expectations seeing as Goblet was my favorite of the books, and based on what I had seen of pictures of the film, as well as reviews from fellow fans...I went thinking that, like PoA, sure there'd be some stuff left out, but that overall, it was still going to be a good adaptation, and an enjoyable movie.",1

I wisely decided to view this film on the weekend after its release, in fear the mob of Harry Potter fans flooding the theaters. After seeing this movie, a great sense of disappointment engulfed my heart. I, being one of those obsessive fans who annually re-read the series, was outraged because Mr. Newell simply did not do justice for the beloved book. It was quite obvious that the director was in a race against time to try and fit everything into the movie. It ran at such a fast pace that I could scarcely begin to enjoy one scene when it suddenly jumped to another. Also, I cannot begin to speak of the great irritation I felt every time a portion of the book was left out, mind you these were parts that I enjoyed. At the end of the movie I was just so greatly relieved that the agony was over.",1
444,8.0,"Finally we have got a Potter flick that somewhat meets our high expectations! Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire captures the drama of the book and makes for gripping, flashy cinema. While some goof-ups are apparent in the film and some important sections of the story have been omitted, the film , on the whole is quite good to see. With the III instalment of the story been a pain to watch, the IV movie restores back the good quality that must be associated to every Potter flick. As this is the flick where The Dark Lord returns, it is certainly a very eagerly awaited one. I must say that the Dark Lord's resurrection is splendidly shown and does give due respect to JKR's visualization.",1

This broader coverage of the world creates a deeper connection for viewers. Through the continuation of great characters' stories and the introduction of new ones, we fall in love with these characters and begin to understand their goals. If John Williams is one of the greatest music writers in modern history, Patrick Doyle is the perfect successor!

449,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is awesome. The story is the best from every sector. Considered perfect The start of the battle, adventure, action that has come into play due to the fact that in this sector Hogwarts has organized a Triwizard tournament. Tourmemt and other magic schools are also participating. Each school will send a representative to compete in this magic tournament. The age of the participants must be at least 17 years old, although Harry is not yet. Reached the criteria, but he accidentally entered the competition. This creates a lot of turmoil because the life expectancy line that Dumbledore, Head Professor of Horgwarts, has a dash. There's no way a child under 17 can deceive, causing the whole school to think that Harry lied that he wasn't doing it, and Harry's best friend Ron became jealous because he thought Harry wanted to be a hero. That's a really crazy idea for me. It frustrates me a lot with Ron's stupidity, but it's understandable because it's Ron Lol, and it leaves Harry out of nowhere. I'm so sad. Ron is seriously bipolar in this regard.",1

The new characters weren't fleshed out at all, overacting marred many of the scenes, and I feel sorry for the director of Order and the Phoenix, because they'll have some job getting the ""Harry's an unstable liar"" storyline in. I can't believe they didn't show what happened to Barty Crouch Jr, as it is CRUCIAL for what happens in Book 5. There were SO MANY things wrong with this film: 1. Dumbledore. Why is the cool, calm and kindly Headmaster with a sense of humour completely freaking out over Harry's selection and pinning him to a wall? This isn't the character we know and love in the books.",0
452,1.0,"It is rare that a film lives up to the book, quite understandable. Any spectator & Harry Potter reader is aware of it. But how much you can indulge? I don't comprehend how Rowling could agree on this script. The movie is a disaster. And I see Kloves get the job for the next part as well? If I was a producer I would not give the dude any job ever again. From a magnificent plot tailored by Rowling he managed to make some atrocious and puzzling B rate movie script. Obviously cuts leads to some alteration of the original plot. Still things make you wonder and frown, or even worse, you want to scream ""what the f**!"" Why on earth the shy, mysterious and rather subtle Krug was made into a testosterone pile of muscles? His romantic relationship with Hermione stays, yet it is made completely ridiculous – listen to that and hold on your chair firm, at some point Hermione tells Harry (about Krug) : victor is more of physical being.not particularly loquacious. WTF???????? You won't see a trace of house elves, thus the whole Barty Crouch Jr plot was altered. You won't hear about his relation wit his father, you won't hear his confession explaining various mysteries accumulated along the storyline. And best of all, he pops in 1st scene of the movie, in the room where Voldermort is discovered by the old housekeeper. In the scene when Harry experiences Dumbledore memories Crouch Jr isn't even on trial (wtf?) . He's denounced by Kharkaroff and appears like a possessed fanatic shouting and screaming... Raping the plot isn't the only thing Kloves managed. He also managed to add stuff of his own (God forbid him ever write a script again) – like the 1st task scene where all sudden the dragon instead of guarding the eggs comes off flying and chasing Harry all over Hogwarts. 2nd task, since there is no Dobby, brings Neville giving Harry the gilliweed, apparently a rare ingredient, which of course Neville got outta nowhere. 3rd task is a joke, NOT ONE creature appears in the maze, just wind and mist. No sphinx, no spider, nada. The movies is full of bad written scenes and things happening deus ex machina. Harry finds Barty Crouch dead (again creative touch of Kloves... sigh) and goes to tell about it Dumbledore, but never actually does! (lol?) The 2 schools arrive at Hogwarts, a scene of cheering and interested looking students, yet the tournament wasn't even announced. You won't see an inch of quidditch except a short glance on teams entering the stadium during the world cup. Of course , no Veelas either, which rapes in its turn the whole Fleur Delacourt intriguing charm aspect. Hagrid brings Mme Maxime to show her the dragons, she shouts ' Magnifique!' while you don't see any dragon yet, they are in crates and only then few moments after break out... Karkaroff is showed entering the room with the goblet of fire, yet his involvement in the plot is never revealed. We are to think that he did put Harry's name in it. If he didn't , why he ever entered that room so sneaky way at all? Fact that Karkaroff runs away after the 3rd task is not even mentioned. Dumbledore runs and shouts like an enraged nazi... When Harry talks to Moody in his room, the chest moves and shakes suspiciously (hint for morons added by Kloves) We got a dancing lesson scene, not in the book, which Kloves obviously found of more added value that all the things he shamelessly cut out already. Weezleys don't appear for the 3rd task at all. There is no argument, no developed scene between Dumbledore and Crouch which would explain what problems will be facing Harry, Dumbledore in the next part. Rita the paparazzi, animageus? Nope, you wont even know. I pity people who came to see this film, not having read the book, because they might be confused and lost, and I pity all HP fans for having endured this. If Reader Digest rewrote Harry Potter, it would be not bad as this. And from what I hear the next part is even worse. Read the book, it's fantastic. Watch the movie at your own risk. Few weeks passed and I still can't shake the disbelief you could make it so bad.",0

First of all, many scenes were jumpy and I didn't know what was going on. Basically, if you haven't read the book, good luck in figuring out what happened in some parts. Even though I read the book I still had trouble following the story. Second, it seemed like the movie missed crucial parts of the book, and instead inserted pointless dialogue and unnecessary comments. Many scenes left me thinking, ""...What?!?"" Third, it seemed like the director was more focused on graphics rather than the plot itself. Again, there were many unnecessary things that the movie didn't need. I was also looking forward to quidditch and the tournament, and was VERY disappointed. In collusion, I did think this movie was okay for all the information that needed to be covered. Other things in the movie: The boys need to cut their hair. The style in this movie is much different (it is a different director) and I preferred the last director. Also Dumbledore, to me, came off as rather rude and rough, COMPLETELY different from what he should be. That is all.",0
458,1.0,"Right after watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire I had to just laugh. Why? Possibly because the film I had just seen was more absurd than magical. Possibly because the acting was so bad. Perhaps it was because the story was generic garbage, or the climax was pathetic, or because it was the same boring plot line that the other Harry Potter books followed. Then again, the most likely reason I was laughing was to soften the blow that I had just wasted seven bucks on this unimaginative, uninteresting, and completely forgettable motion picture. It is not a masterpiece as you have been constantly told, nor is it a good movie or even a mediocre one. It is nothing.There is no heart or soul to this film. There is no substance to anything happening on screen. Don't waste your time on this movie, or the Harry Potter franchise. You'll save yourself some time, your brain, and seven bucks.",0

The directing is good and there is a good mix of thrills, more sinister bits, and comedy. Some of the bigger scenes are breathtaking, such as at the quidditch world cup. Sadly the actual game is completely cut, and this is very disappointing. The film does contain a lot of scarier moments, and does deserve its 12A certificate.

461,9.0,"In reading this review, do not misunderstand: I loved the movie; but only as such: a movie. I did not love it as an adaptation. The whole of this movie was not a true adaptation; Great elements were left non-existent: The Weasley twins, Fred and George, and Mr. Weasley, arriving by Floo Network, and giving Dudley suspicious candy that has a nasty reaction (in Dudley and his parents point of view)on Dudley. In my opinion of the scene, it is hilarious, which adds to my disappointment; this was something that saddened me, to see that this was not in the film: I was anticipating this scene, among others, to be in the film, and found that they were not. The biggest mistake (and I cannot fathom how it could be overlooked), was the Tri-Wizard tournament winnings: They are, in the book, to be given to two particular members of the Weasley family (Fred and George) and this was not within the film; to someone who has not read the books, but has only seen the film, it would seem that this isn't a big deal, but it most certainly is: These winnings are what fund the twins' future endeavor, and should have been placed in the film. Why is it that something so short could not be placed in the film, like the Dursley's scene, yet we have an escaped dragon, and a lengthy battle, when this does not happen in the books, yet no simple scenes that really did exist in the books? I was OK with the idea that the Quidditch World Cup was short as is was--at least it was there at all-- but some things should not be omitted, and this should have been two movies. For once, I would like someone to step up, and say ""no more cuts for adaptation. Everything stays."" As a film, I love it.. please understand that; The movie is great, I enjoyed it. I am merely disappointed in yet another adaptation left somewhat dry.",1

The film is very funny and remains , in that way, faithful to the book...

However, enormous mistakes are made. the beginning is very disappointing, the most important informations are not given (we don't know, for example, that the house is the house of Voldy's parents...). We only see Sirius once, no one seems to care about what happen to Barty Crouch ( the one with the mustache) after he is seen unconscious in the woods and after saying over and over that the weird sisters were played by Jarvis Cocker and two radiohead members you only get to see them once. fortunately, the songs they play are brilliant. Finally, the end sucks.... everyone is happy and doesn't seem to be troubled by what just happened at Hogwarts....Mike Newell saw the funny aspect of the book, the incredible humor of JK Rowling (which is already good) but he missed the darkness of the book. Columbus had made a massacre of the books because is only interest was to focus on the story.Alfonso Cuaron had seen the atmosphere and the poetry of the books and that is why his movie was closer to the Harry Potter spirit and remains to that day the best harry potter film... The only director who could have seen the real pain, the real darkness that is in the 4th potter book and that we find again in the 5th and 6th book, is Tim Burton. When I read the books, it was like reading Burton's universe, his dark humor, his characters. Only his visual genius could have made a perfect adaptation of Harry Potter. Harry Potter and the goblet of fire is not the story of a boy who feels like an outsider because he doesn't know how to ask girls to dance with him. He is a teenager who has to face death and the dark side that is in him. Lord Voldemort is not just some crazy psychopath, he is Harry's double (through all the books Rowling shows us the similarities between Harry and the dark lord). Just like catwoman is divided by her two personalities Burton had already expressed that duality, that's why it's a pity that no one offered him the chance to do it one more time.",1

No one wanted to know how he escaped from a prison only 1 person has gotten out of? MAJOR plot parts were left out when other parts could have been shorter. Like the dragon fight and the ballroom could have been cut in half. The left out the whole part of Barty SR house elf and the end was a bit of a let down. Also left out the part about Rita Skeeter being able to transform into a bug and spy on people and when Hagrid asked Madam Maxim if she was half giantess.

I was glad to watch the movie, but very disappointed with what the directed and producers decided to do. The book is so massive now that the movie should of been two parts. Not only that, but the book was a major turning point in the series. The first three were mainly back story, but in the fourth, we find out a lot more about Harry and the other characters as they grow up. I also agree and wonder about why they let Dumblerdore lose it? He is always calm and it was very out of character to have him shake Harry. They really should of known better. I think many more people will be disappointed like me.",0

Now, lacking the history of reading the three previous books, this might be an observation already accepted by those who have read them prior to watching the first three movies. But for me, this was quite literally one of the worst film adaptations I have ever seen in my life. This film carelessly left out some of the more interesting and key elements of the book.

However, due to my experience in the cinema last time (what idiots think that 4 year old kids will be able to sit still in a cinema for almost 3 hours?) I decided to get it on video this time. Although I was a bit unsure as to the relevance of the opening Quidditch scene (it just seemed to jump right into it then move on) it did mark the start to what was an enjoyably dark film with a good pace and enough substance to hold my interest. The story is a rather long winded way of getting us closer to the conclusion of the story and, I suppose, looking back on the narrative it does play like just a load of set pieces with the elephant constantly stood in the dark corner of the room.

This one is big on special effects and action and although it touches on the characters' emotional issues it never addresses any of those issues in depth. This is unfortunately a typical Hollywood blockbuster type of movie that lacks the charm of the prior Harry Potter movies. There is no uplifting feeling to any aspect of this movie. When it's over, it's simply over. Certainly Azkaban was not as charming as the first two, but Azkaban replaced that charm with a definite edge. Goblet lacks that edge. Since the cast was excellent, with the exception of Michael Gambon who continues his lethargic portrayal of Dumbeldore, the blame must fall squarely at the feet of new series director Mike Newell.

He's the Nosferatu of the ""Potter"" series, but with a further sense of dread that is the unwavering sense of pure evil in such a world of wizards and magic. But Goblet of Fire isn't just about the evil, or just put-on evil by way of a curse or other dark forces at work, though it's in this that the film works usually at its strongest and most surreal points. There's a whole section dedicated to a new form of competition: get the dragon's egg in the Triwizard tournament.

491,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005): Dir: Mike Newell / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robert Pattinson, Michael Gambon: Fourth film in the series regards achievement in a plot about wizard schools competing in a tournament. Although one wizard per school can compete, Potter's name is revealed to much controversy. He is the youngest to compete in a tournament that involves dragons, an underwater sea world, and an overwhelming maze. Director Mike Newell handles the material well as the third director to tackle the series. The special effects are breathtaking with flying horses, dragons, ghosts, mermaids, and other images that spark the imagination. Daniel Radcliffe returns again as Harry who undertakes perhaps his most difficult task. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger may be discovering romance. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is given humorous moments involving a dance. Robert Pattinson is added as one of the tournament finalist who has clothes ties with Potter that lead to an electrifying climax. Michael Gambon provides the wisdom and authority of wizard Dombledore. The films exist to bring the J.K. Rowling books to life. Perhaps discernment should be given to young children before viewing its creepy atmosphere. Otherwise this is a pointless exercise in imagery is what keeps the goblet's fire burning bright.

493,9.0,"Serving as a sort of transitional period both thematically and in terms of story, re-introducing the 'big bad' of the series in a big way, this darker feature doesn't pull its punches and is all the more successful for it. The score isn't as iconic in 'Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire (2005)' and not all of its emotional beats hit quite the way they're intended to (although most do). However, its interesting twists and successful set-pieces amplify the dangerous aspects of this 'wizarding world' while changing the franchise forever. It balances its tone pretty much perfectly; it's perhaps the funniest film in the franchise but it's also properly grim, even somewhat scary. Its finale, in particular, is surprisingly ballsy and emotionally affecting. As a whole, this is an enjoyable and genuinely thrilling adventure that gets properly tense, too. 9/10",1

495,8.0,"I thought Sorcerer's Stone was a faithful adaptation of the first book. I thought Chamber of Secrets was better, even though it is probably my least favorite of the books. And I thought Prisoner of Azkaban was outstanding and the best movie so far. I was worried that with the constant changing of directors, the movies wouldn't feel connected, but my fears have been for nothing, since Alfonso Cuarón brought the vision I had hoped the first two movies would have, and Mike Newell continues down that path with Goblet of Fire. While the first two movies had more of a clean and friendly look, the last two movies have turned darker and more mystical, which makes sense considering the story lines are getting darker and more serious. In Goblet of Fire everyone is hitting that age where girls (and boys) become more important and feelings stir inside that you don't understand. One of the problems (in a good way) with having read the books numerous times, is that I know when things aren't there, and when things are changed. The first difference comes almost immediately when a character is shown in the first sequence, who is only mentioned in the book. I do however understand why he was shown, since there isn't a narrative to keep him in the minds of the readers. He needs to be shown so that you can recall him later on when he pops up again. I'll admit at first I was worried that this was a precursor to how the rest of the movie would be, but for the most part, the script was faithful to the book. Screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written the first four films, but is taking a break from the fifth movie before coming back for the sixth) knows the story so well that he can easily shift from Dobby saying something to Neville saying something, and have it not only make sense, but still be acceptable to us die hard fans. The major points of the book were in place, save for the Quidditch World Cup, which was compressed into a few minutes. We see the aftermath of the World Cup, we see all three Tri-Wizard tournament challenges and we see the Yule Ball. If you ask any of the Harry Potter faithful, I think we'd all say that those are the biggest set pieces. At the same time, the story line of Mad-Eye Moody is well done, as well as the continuing romance-to-be of Ron and Hermione. So from a book-to-movie point of view, I thought the script was well written and still faithful to the book.",1

497,9.0,"I really hate how they make Dumbledore's character appear weak and less ""all knowing"". The original Dumbledore was perfect, more like the book. Even though a wizard as high up and smart as Dumbledore is, he still has some fault, but he doesn't show it. He is the pillar for everyone around him to look up to, to know what to do and to trust him b/c of that persona. I just don't like how the actor in this movie portrays Dumbledore. I know it's also how it's written and directed though so it's not all on the actor. In the book, Dumbledore would have never attacked Harry and had any doubt that Harry did not put his name in the Goblet. He knows better! And throughout the movie it continues, his uneasiness and concern shows too much weakness for such an intelligent and crafty wizard.",1

The only way I can see how it can fit everything in the novel in one movie is to make it two parts like they did with ""Deathly Hallows"". And even than it probably wouldn't be enough probably. But maybe it should have been around 3 hours in order to fit as much of the stuff in the novel into the movie. Daniel Radcliffe didn't grow up so well, the younger version of Harry Potter was just simply more likable. Emma Watson on the other hand is growing up nicely and starting to get more likable. I still can't get used to Michael Gambon playing Albus Dumbledore. He just lacked the charisma and the certain aura the previous actor that passed away was able pull off the person you just have to respect presence. But most of all lacked the connection between the other characters. Not a fan of the books of this franchise, but I gotta admit this movie is missing a lot of creative and clever parts from the novel.

It has spectacular action sequences, amazing visual effects, and great set designs. The music score, while not as good as the score in prisoner of Azkaban, is still very pleasant. Daniel Radcliffe definitely shows an improvement over Prisoner, but still has some problems. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint play their character exactly how they are supposed to be, and I found that Hermione seemed much more bossy and over-protective in this film than the 3rd, which is more Hermione-ish from the books. Brenda Gleeson was perfect for this role! Some of the characters could have been further developed, like Fleur or Krum, but overall, a hugely entertaining and magical Potter film. The pacing, although fast, does not have the fluent steady tone of Prisoner's pace, or the wonderful cinematography or visuals.

I thought that the movie made Harry out to be a blubbering idiot. In the books, Harry actually spent a lot of time practicing spells and learning new ones to prepare, while in the movie, it showed nothing of what Harry actually did to get through the Triwizard Tournament. The maze for the Tournament was terrible! Where were the challenges that lurked around every corner? Where was wit needed to reach the center? All they did was run around to escape the ""blowing wind"" and ""roots."" Terrible! Dumbledore's character in the movie seemed much more sinister and downright mean.

512,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's much more complex than the previous three were, it has a very different story that takes the characters beyond the floors of Hogwarts, the last hour of the film kept me at th edge of my seat and had more suspense than the other three films combined. Another aspect that makes it stand out is how much the characters mature and grow, we see different relationships develop between them and also some changing, the dynamics between Harry, Ron and Hermione are significantly different, they now have a more complicated friendship that they struggle to hold together, which makes the audience support them even more. The only thing I felt this movie was missing was more time for the supporting characters to shine, the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, who have been terrific in the past and still shine here, feel very underused, whenever we see them we feel as if there is more to come, but there never is, even Michael Gambon's screen time as Dumbledore felt very limited, I couldn't help but feel there was a little too much focus on Harry. As we see the characters grow we also get the same from the performances, all the actors shine even more than they did in the first three, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson truly understand their characters and deliver their roles with pure class, and are joined by a fantastic supporting cast that includes Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Timothy Spall, David Tennant and, of course, Ralph Fiennes, portraying Lord Voldermort, this series Darth Vader, for his first time, and after being teased for three films we are not one bit disappointed by the first stand off between the lead protagonist and antagonist of the series, it was a pure delight.

515,7.0,"19 November 2005. There is too much for one movie to do justice to this new edition of Rowling's book. While there is plenty of action and humor, the substance, the character development is missing oftentimes. I couldn't really get into any of the characters from the other invited schools. These new characters are so stereotypical and bland as to be poor dressing for the movie and their exploits are practically ignored. Even Harry doesn't seem to be all there either - with so much that he has been through, he doesn't seem to have grown up or matured all that much as would be expected. Hermoine's character doesn't seem to have a lot to do, except date and show that she's growing up. Even at the end, when something terrible happens to an important character, it's difficult to really have much sympathy. This convoluted and sometimes confusing new edition is difficult to follow at times and not all the dots seem to connect up. Overall, the movie was interesting, the effects nice, yet the fun intensity seems missing. And literally most of the magic seems to have been left out, Harry seems to operate as if he has forgotten much of what he has learned from previous books. This dazzling, gorgeously gigantic display sputters some when the dense content of the movie is presented to a much more highly anticipating audience. Seven out of Ten Stars.",0

517,6.0,"The good news is that it is better than the previous installment (Prisoner of Azkaban). The bad news is that it's not as good as the first two, which had a sense of freshness and wonder about them. It does a nice job of evoking the Hogwarts environment but is undone by too many characters, too much plot, and too much special effects. To fully appreciate this, one must have read not only the book it's based on but the previous books as well. The Rowling books manage to be ponderous and silly while taking themselves too seriously; these qualities, unfortunately, have been faithfully transferred to the screen.",0
518,,"I enjoyed the first Harry Potter for its novelty but found it quite forgettable, and slept through a good part of the second one. The Prisoner of Azkaban, number three, began to get more of my attention, with its clever introduction of the element of the time paradox, plus the realistic blurring of the line between good and evil, in both Sirius Black and Professor Lupin.

Goblet of Fire, with a new director in Mike Newell, continues Alfonso Cuaron's darker and and more sinister tone, pitching Harry against a whole new range of beasts and dark wizards, but it's the section around the middle of the film - where Harry and his ever-present friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must find dates and attend formal dance the Yule Ball - that delights the most and brings the very best out of it's still-young actors.",1
524,8.0,"This film should have been in two parts, there is so much missing and I think the investment would have paid off (We all know we would have paid to see it). I do sit watching and wondering whether it only makes sense, because I know what's not being said from reading the books. I actually think in about 5-10 years we will see a TV series version and I hope they fill it with all the good bits that are missing, especially from this film. There is so much that is unexplained or altered for the film, that it's easy to get a bit lost. Trying to explain everything to anyone who hasn't read the books as religiously as I have is not always easy, but they all have so many questions.

The rest of the film is just another piece of adolescent rubbish that has no depth or a sense of reality.

All in all though it was done very well. didn't understand why they missed out stuff in the maze but those moving bushes were scary and when Fleur gets dragged under was also creepy. Thought Voldormort could have been scarier. I think that Mad-Eye was fantastic, funny and really a good character. Thats about it!",1
528,1.0,"I haven't read any of the books, but this film was mind-blasting crud. This was supposed to be about a competition between wizards. Where was the difficult magic, or the dangerous spells or finger-chewing danger. The competition seemed to be decided by who could run the fastest. Now here's my suggestion. HP in a dark forest. The sound of the pubescent wizard-munching monster draws near. HP casts his mind back through hours of magic lessons and remembers the spell that might help. BUT he needs to gather all the ingredients for his potion. Imagine the atmosphere as all is nearly ready, but he cant find any virgins blood. Just then Hermione appears. HP pricks her (snigger) and adds her blood to his potion. NOTHING!! ""I I I I dddon't understand"" stammers HP as the monster crashes into the clearing. ""Sorry"" says Hermione, blushing.

Far worse, the evil Lord Voldemort returns to try and claim vengeance against the heroic young wizard. Imperfect but very entertaining entry loses some momentum in the middle as it gets sidetracked by a distracting subplot, but other than that it's a visual smörgåsbord of magic and craftsmanship, and has an exciting, edge of your seat climax. Never quite as rousing or awe-inspiring as the Prisoner of Azkaban, but a fun-filled adventure just the same, with enough joy for young children, and enough edge and sophistication for adults. ***",1

537,6.0,"I am not a big fan of the HP film adaptations. My problem is not so much that they cut a lot of material from the books or that they change things, it's that they fall into two categories: either they're slow-moving and preoccupied with every little detail from the books to the point of tedium (the first two films) or they go through the story so fast that those who have not read the books have no clue what is what and what is going on. Goblet of Fire falls into the latter category. It rushes over so much of the book, explains big concepts at mach speed, and refuses to spend time on character moments to help us connect to the heroes better.",0

541,9.0,"In issue 107 of Total Film, in an article about 2005's summer blockbusters' commercial success, it was said that if Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had been released during the summer, we would have witnessed the ultimate box-office war: Potter vs. Star Wars (Revenge of the Sith was the most successful movie among those listed in the magazine). That article's author was right: it would have been a huge battle, since both HP4 and ROTS are the best episodes of their respective franchises (actually, ROTS shares the title with The Empire Strikes Back) and both deal with more mature situations and characters, as evil is about to make its triumphant return. And in the case of both movies, the PG-13 rating was justified, the darkness factor being doubled compared to previous installments (in the case of Goblet of Fire, we've also got a few puberty-related gags and dialogues which aren't exactly suitable for everyone). But enough with the Star Wars comparisons, let's talk about the teen wizard's individual merits.",1

543,5.0,"I have to say i was a little disappointed when i saw the film as critics and friends had been saying how well it kept to the book and managed to cut down the story to the essentials. I found that by cutting out all of those elements the film was reduced to a piece that felt forced along at too fast a pace not being able to linger on any important part of the story for fear of over-running its alloted time. By cutting out so much of the book the film lost some of the spirit that has made the books such a refreshing, ingenious and popular series. The fact that the actor they found to play Harry has about as much talent and charisma as a block of wood also doesn't help the film either. The only thing i can say for it is that it had fantastic visual effects and very appealing 'eye-candy' in the forms of Pattinson and Ianevski and that the closing 15 minutes did a little to redeem an otherwise unsatisfactory movie.",0

The movies were originally made for all types of people, age and preference wise. There was fantasy, adventure, romance, horror, etc. This movie was based on adventure. And for anyone who has ever read the books, this movie was NOTHING compared to the book. They left out so much from the book, that they are going to have to do some re-editing somewhere, because information that they left out, some of it was vital to the next book/movie. As just a movie, I would give it a low rating as well. For someone who had never read the book, it was very confusing. My best friend had never read the book, and the first ten minutes of the movie, she was leaning against my arm and asking me what the heck was going on. All in all, it was a major disappointment and I hope that the next one will be made closer to what the original three were.",0

The movie is very fast paced with a lot of amazing action sequence that are very rememberable. The whole cast does an amazing job acting as well. It goes deep into the very exciting story it tells while also building up the development of the main characters' emotions and chemistry between each other. The unexpected climax, which would normally be a bad move in any other story, was flawlessly built up to throughout the beginning of the series and plays out unforgettably with the tragic ending that leaves the audience in suspense. Also, the beginning of the film was crazy rushed through. Many scenes felt rushed and the scenes that felt rushed were important moments.

554,10.0,"I was a bit worried with so much missing from the movie, that this would not live up to the Harry Potter name. I was mistaken. Although yes, it is true, there is no Mrs. Weasley, The Dursleys, Dobby or Winky, and even the introduction of the older Weasly boys, Director Mike Newell did the best job possible with the limited time he had. The effects were great, as expected, and the movie flowed very well. The movie could have been longer just because it really didn't feel like a 2 hour and 20 minutes movie. One thing I greatly enjoyed was that someone finally got the idea of Fred and George. They screen time must have doubled from the first three movies combined. A lot of funny moments and Fred and George were a part of them all. It's just too bad they didn't have Percy in there as I would have loved to see Fred and George cut him down as they do in the books and movies past. All the main scenes from the book was pretty much done to form. Ralph Fiennes nailed the performance of Lord Voldemort and I would not be surprised to hear a buzz start with Brendan Gleeson being nominated for an Oscar as Mad Eye Moody. Miranda Richardson caps off the great performances with her portrayal of Rita Skeeter. If I had to make a complaint, the only one it might be is that Rupert Grint was hard to understand at times, however, it was only in very small doses. It is fine to take children under 13, although there is your standard violence, but nothing compared to Lord of the Rings. There are a couple of deaths, but only one is shown and it is not bad. A little flirtation, like when Moaning Myrtle is floating around as Harry is taking a bath, but the little hinted jokes really won't be noticeable to kids. Only other ""iffy"" issue when it comes to sexuality, oh, maybe Hagrid in his slow dance with Madame Maxime, but if you can't handle a butt grab, you probably didn't plan on seeing the movie anyway. Oh, and a lot of people were confused by Neville Longbottom being upset as he saw a spider creature get tortured. It is brought up in the pensieve that Barty Crouch Jr. tortured his parents, but a lot people didn't put the two together. Enjoy!",1
555,,"On the fourth cinematic outing for Harry and his chums, we have a third director (Mike Newell) and a darker, scarier approach (which attracts the first non-PG certificate). All the familiar characters are back at Hoggwarts, but - with the exception of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) - the established adults are given only minor roles, surrendering the floor to Alastor 'Mad Eye' Moody (played with verve by Brendan Gleeson). At the heart of this adventure is the Triwizard Tournament involving an airborne dragon chase, an undersea rescue, and a devouring maze which provide plenty of challenges for Harry and excitement for young viewers, although an non-reader of the books (like me) can be confused at times.",1
556,9.0,"The movie was GREAT! No doubt about it. However, someone like me who has read the book filled in the missing details as we were watching the film. What the film needed was a couple of key scenes that would explain some things a little more to the people who did not read the book. If the director had added in the capture of Rita Skeeter, an explanation that Harry did win the Tri-Wizard Tournament, formally introducing Gabrielle as Fleur's sister, the Minister Of Magic refusing to believe Dumbledore that Voldemort is back, and maybe even show some of the Wizard World Cup final. it would not have been as confusing to them. I think they were too adamant in sticking to the 2:45 time limit. Other than that the other cuts that were made (No S.P.E.W., No Dursleys, etc.) were OK with me. The visuals were outstanding. I'm hoping that an Extended Edition will be released.",0

After some disappointment with Prisoner of Azkaban I was holding my breath going into this movie, but it not only met but exceeded my expectations. It is not an exact copy of the books which I know did disappoint a few people I know but I also understand there is no good way to make a 734 page book into a movie and keep a movie audience interested, esp., when a portion of your audience doesn't necessarily read the books. However I think people need to remember that this movie is an adaptation, which means it takes the major plot ideas and uses them for a different medium.",0
560,,"Unlike its gorgeous predecessor ""Goblet of Fire"" is quite an ugly movie, with a very dull, plastic look to it. Surprising, considering it was shot by ""Twelve Monkeys"" and ""Brazil"" cinematographer Roger Pratt, who seemed to have been in his ""102 Dalmatians"" mode while shooting this. Mike Newell does an okay job directing the film I guess, he gets the tone right and the film is not boring at a gargantuan 157 minutes. The screenplay by Steve Kloves is again a rushed narrative jumping through as many of the big setpieces as possible. I suppose it must have been hard to adapt this lengthy book (which is my favorite or second favorite of the series), but Kloves didn't do a very good job of it as far as I'm concerned. It's basically setpiece-humorous coming of age aside-setpiece on repeat. The performances vary in quality but most of them are good-very good. With a prettier aesthetic I may have been able to forgive some of the flaws, but the film still entertains, staying at the level of the previous installment albeit with very different strengths and weaknesses. The overwhelmingly positive critical reviews at the time aren't hard to understand, it was the most human and emotional of the Potter films at the time and I recall the set-pieces dazzling on a theater screen, but it's just okay on second viewing at home, failing to capitalize on the huge jump in quality in both the source material and films from the second to the third installment and continue in that vein, instead leveling out.",0

The acting has certainly become worse in some areas here and there. Ralphe Fiennes does'nt really seem to be sincere as he looks unthreatening and pathetic when playing Voldemort. Not scary at all.

Nothing in this movie was ever going to top that emotionally riveting scene. Every man's dream - a mixture of childish innocence, youthful beauty and understated desire, who could deny she embodied at that moment, every aspect of sought-after femininity a man could crave? The film hit the heights in places - the computer graphics for the Quidditch World Cup.

Also this sequel lacks good intro which previous sequels had better.

As for the rest of us, well, since we don't tend to be HARRY POTTER fans in the first place, this choppily edited, disjointed, CGI-heavy kiddie adventure tends to leave a very unsatisfying taste in the mouth. I honestly am not sure who would want to see this. Whatever money it makes, it presumably makes off of those who read the book, and few others. And those who read the book are not likely to recommend it to others, nor be repeat viewers. I predict the studio is going to experience a dramatic downturn in the box office take on the final three movies. (An easy prediction, actually, as I am a former film reviewer.) Also, the leads are becoming less appealing as they grow older.

The film was also scary, so younger kids beware. The parts that were left out of the book were cleverly weaved around to make the plot workable.

576,10.0,"I have three favorite Harry Potter films. Ever since The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Harry Potter films lost their cute. They turned over to the dark side. In this Potter film, Harry, Ron, and Hermione return for their fourth year. Harry has been having dark dreams about THe Dark Lord(who is finally in this film and he doesn't disappoint. He is played by the fantastic Ralph Fienes). Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is entered into a tournament that he can't compete in. It's called THe Triwizard Tournament. He's underage. But he has to compete in it because the rules say he has to. Two other schools, from Beaxbatons and Bulgaria, will compete against Hogwarts. Robert Pattinson from Twilight makes his debut as Cedric Diggory, who is also representing Hogwarts. Also this year, they will be having The Yule Ball, a dance of some sort. Harry also has feelings for Cho(Katie Leung), who returns in the Order of the Phoenix. Of the three kids, Hermione is the only one to get lucky.

577,3.0,I've never been so disappointed in my life. Watching that movie made me feel like I was on drugs because it was so sporadic and had no continuity. I understand that there was an immense amount of material to squeeze into one movie but it could have been handled so much better. Basically if you hadn't read the book you would have had no idea what was going on. The only good part of the movie was from the point Harry and Cedric grabbed the Triwizard Cup portkey until the end. I hate this director with a passion. I honestly think I was shaking my head through the movie more than I was appreciating it. And to think I believed the movies were getting better...,0

One major plot flaw is, that Mad Eye Moody (or Barty Crouch Jr.) could have handed Harry a portkey whenever he wanted, Harry wouldn't have had to take part in the Triwizard Tournament. Any object in Mad Eye's study could have been transformed into a portkey and the only thing Mad Eye would have had to do is to have Harry touch it while having a cup of tea with him. It would have saved him all the trouble of getting Harry through the tournament and he could have done so at any time throughout the whole year. ",0

It looks startlingly good at times - especially good are some of the beautiful touches in the cinematography, and Miranda Richardson invests her character with an excellent blend of the comic and the sinister. Wisely, parts of the book - especially the interminable Quidditich World Cup - are slimmed down, meaning the long-running time doesn't drag. Speaking of Quidditch, it really does seem to be a sport invented by someone who doesn't understand what makes the competitive sport so appealing to so many; its brief appearance in the film means we don't have time to dwell on that. The climactic tragedy is genuinely moving, sealing a film that works very well.",1

However, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' feels like a collection of short clips. Each sequence seems disconnected, not fully developed, ended abruptly, and moved to next sequence so hastily. I understand it's more than difficult to have all the stories in the book, but connecting each story can be smoother. Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore is the worst. He did not read the book for sure. Adaptation from novels can change the story based on director's convenience and preference. Totally acceptable. However, changing the character's characteristics without any justification is no-no. Dumbledore should be calm among anything. He is a father figure in the book, but he is a worked-up Tournament referee and narrator in the film. Gambon's Dumbledore is angry, loud, and maniac all the time. He almost ruined the entire work.",0

As for computer animation and action scenes they are perfect, but I m tired of such films which have flooded the world.

600,7.0,"Although this is a good film, it unfortunately hearkens back to the adaptation technique from the novels of the first two films rather than trying to be a film. Whereas Azkaban really had a beginning, middle, and end, and thus kept the pacing going, this film doesn't and for that reason it seems to be many scenes strung together just to keep the plot going. This makes for a slower pacing and makes the 2 1/2 hours seem like MUCH longer. The problem really is, since this is movie number 4, it has to rely on the previous 3 films and that makes the plot more complicated (thus having to tell more in the same amount of the approximate 2 1/2 hours for each film). In fact, they had to cut a LOT out to even make it possible to keep it at 2 1/2 hours and regardless it still seemed too long! Hopefully, with Order of the Phoenix, which is a long book like this Goblet of Fire but has a shorter plot overall, they can avoid this problem. And as a side note, although Patrick Doyle did try his best with this score, he isn't John Williams and I hope Williams does find time to score the last 3 films in the Harry Potter series. 7 out of 10.",0

605,,"Okay, lets start it off like this. So far, THIS is the best Potter movie! Amazingly done, Mike Newell has nailed the series! Comparing him to the other two Potter directors, Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron, Mike seemed to be more familiar with the boarding school style, and has he ever done a fantasy movie before? What would you call two of his other films Donnie Brasco and Pushing Tin? Mike was pretty much a starter in this genre, and he sure pulled it off nice enough. What's amazing about this one, is that it does not focus on only ONE thing. In the previous 3 films (which weren't that bad, but still) the majority of scenes would end with Hermione saying something along the lines of ""Harry! I found another clue on why Sirius Black wants to kill you!"" No, this one added more on the maturing students, the Triwizard tournament, friendship conflicts and so on. The Radiohead guest appearance was amusing and funny to watch the Hogwarts kids partying like everyday teens. The only thing that bugged me about this was the amount of screen time for Sirius Black. He had more moments in the book, and technically you didn't see Gary Oldmans real face, all he had was a CGI face in the fireplace. A little disappointing, especially to the Gary Oldman fans. Well that pretty much covers the movie, 10/10!",0

614,7.0,".....and, short of making a 6-hour film, a condensation is what this film is. The script must have been absolutely rotten to write. What to leave in? What to leave out? JK Rowling's books are so full of totally imaginative magical things and creatures. But they left in enough magical moments to make the film work. The film is executed beautifully. Some of the art department's work, particularly the Yule Ball set, is stunning. Wardrobe also did a fantastic job on all the finery for the ball. The young main characters, now seasoned actors, are coming along in their acting abilities. The adult actors, as usual, are terrific. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape scares me every time I see him! The direction is first-rate. Overall, a very enjoyable film. I'm not going to complain about what was left out. When you try to make a 2-1/2 hour film from a 700 page book, some things just gotta go. I did want to see what a blast-ended skrewt looked like, though! Very little of real import was left out of the film vs the book. I believe that anyone who follows just the films should be able to keep up. Left in, and so importantly so, is the young wizards growing up. Their relationships are now taking on more adult-like characteristics. They are (in some cases, rather reluctantly) discovering the opposite sex. They're moodier than before. They're, well, they're Teenagers! I did think that the special effects in this film left me feeling that they should have been much better, and that's my major complaint about the film. The mood of this film, while having a lot of lighter moments, turns very, very dark toward the end. Death is now reality for the students of Hogwarts. Readers of the books can just fill in the blanks and embellish the film with all the little goodies that there just wasn't time for. I'm looking forward to the Order of the Phoenix! I just wish they wouldn't make us all wait so damned long between films!",1

620,8.0,"Directed by Mike Newell Harry Potter and the goblet of fire it's Harry and the gangs forth years as they start it off by attending the the world quittich cup, it's raided by deatheaters the followers of Lord Voldmort. While the ministry keeps it under wraps Hogwarts host the Tri-wizard Tournament where three Schools compete in a series of deadly challenges. All at the same time Harry begins to suspect that something not right within the Tournament. The Goblet of Fire has always been one of my favorite, it serve as the climax of the series essentially. It's always stand out because of all that goes on with it. The biggest takeaway are the tournament and the Yule ball. Harry and the others are getting older they start to take more interest in things such as the opposite sex and relationships. Which lead to a lot a funny moments that add the the relatability as everybody doesn't really know how to approach the situation the boys and the girls. It starts to show more how they all develop more. Harry himself is a real dork in this film and it great, pretty much the majority of the school ostracize him. Even Ron for no reason pissed off at Harry for being in the tournament . I guess it's to make it seem like he's just jealous of being like the third wheel in a sense. However it not the first time you've seen Harry in the spotlight. It really comes out of nowhere and just makes Ron look like a dick the first half. Hermione does offer some encouragement to Harry. Who's probably like the only one in the movie who actually admits that she's worried for him. They do begin to start to throw implications between her and Ron more subtle. The current cast all still manage to get their moments whether it's Fred & George or Snape. Who probably has one of my favorite moments where he's just smack Ron and Harry upside the head. The new characters mad-eye moody play by Brandon Gleeson is rather interesting character. I have to say when I first watched this film he most definitely stood out, without a doubt the most bizarre character in the series. Out of all the dark arts teachers he most definitely stands out the most. Although I'd always prefer Lupin more considering that he just had more of a personal connection to Harry and his parents. In addition with Cedric Diggory(Robert Pattison) the only Hufflepuff in the entire series of any significance. Before Twilight he was in Harry Potter, and the screentime he has not bad. I have to say though I've always never felt like him and Harry really had a connection. They honestly don't really interact that much with each other. It's also nice with the other champions you get an idea more what is what other wizards are like outside of Britain. This is really the only film before fantastic beasts to address that. Finally the tournament the challenge themselves are still great to watch. The set up of the first task is up there's just such an absence of sound and build up. You know what's coming and then all of a sudden boom this dragon just flies out of nowhere spewing fire . It really sets the tone that yeah these challenge are legit danger, and it's not just a game. The dark murky water of the Black Lake. It actually feels like Harry is at risk. The third task I've always felt was the weakest and I think everybody agrees. Especially if you read the books or done research you know that there's supposed to be all kinds of creatures like a Spinx and Boggart. However none of that's really made it into the film. Knowing that it's honestly disappointing when the previous challenges had dragons and mermaid's. Of course the biggest payoff to this film overall is the ending *spoilers* that is the outcomes of the tournament all orchestrated by his followers Voldemort finally returns. Ralph Fiennes actually in person in front of the camera you just feel the presence that has been build up to this character and now you finally see him and it's like we're in trouble.",1

624,1.0,"I went into GoF with relatively high expectations after the commendable turnaround work of PoA. After 2+ hours, I left the movie theater feeling rather... empty (and questioning whether I really had just watched a movie at all). Although, I realize the challenges that the screenwriter and director must have faced in adapting such a lengthy book, the effort was glaringly unfocused. The main theme of the 4th book was the Triwizard Tournament, yet the movie gives almost no emphasis on the overarching event besides the spectacle itself. Character development was sacrificed for special effects, and much of the core interaction seemed contrived. My main criticism is that unlike the seamless flow of PoA, GoF essentially carried itself from scene to scene with cringe-worthy transitions if any. And while the acting of the Gryffindor Trio has improved somewhat, the overall effect still left much to be desired. If forced to make a comparison, I would say that GoF is still better than SS and CoS but a definite regression from PoA. Ultimately, it felt as if the movie wanted to do everything at once and ended up doing almost nothing quite well enough.",0

This movie boasts all the amazing visuals and thrilling excitement of the previous three movies. Some fans of the books may be unhappy with what was left out of this film. (Editing a 700+ page book into a two and a half hour movie couldn't have been easy!) While quite a bit from the book was left out, what was left in the movie will not disappoint. Gleeson makes the most of his debut, and becomes a standout character. And the appearance of Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort will be a landmark for this movie franchise.

All that said, I kind of enjoyed the first few movies but it has taken me a long time to get around to this one. The effects were terrific for the most part,but the way the film was put together was less than appealing. It seemed to be an endless parade of scenes which had little relevance to the scene that went before and certainly did not drive the story forward. It was very boring and tedious, made worse by Emma Watson's amateurish performance, breathlessly declaiming almost every line - could Mike Newell get nothing better out of her? Daniel Radcliffe was very good in it -I still think he was a great choice for Harry as he has to carry the movies -if he did not work, neither would the films. Rupert Grint was treading water, both in his performance and script-wise. There was not much for him to do. Brendan Gleeson was a great addition to the cast. On a more positive note I was suddenly hooked by the final half hour. The graveyard scene, when Ralph Fiennes finally entered the action, was superb.

I liked the idea that there are other wizarding schools and they compete in a competition. It was interesting to properly see Voldermot in the movie and looking forward to seeing him in the other 4 movies where we all know Harry is going to humble him.",1
634,9.0,"But that doesn't really bother me, this is the first Harry Potter movie to be rated PG-13, which is a little harsh considering what happens. I've seen more violence in a plan PG movies in the old days. The rating board is too strict, it's time to reform of dissolve the rating system. Other countries don't blind fold children from he very world around us. that's just stupid. Anyway, about the movie, the characters are all there, I like the new character of Madeye. Now Harry has to face something more terrifying then giant three headed dogs, men with two faces, giant spiders, giant snakes that kill by looking at you or even fire breathing dragons, asking a girl out on a date. That's one terror he may not be able to face. Anyway, I didn't like the fight between Harry and Ron, good friends shouldn't fight over stupid things.",0
635,9.0,"Harry Potter doesn't seem to disappoint. Once agian just like the other films, The Goblet Of Fire gave more and more to this franchise. Though not as good as The Prisoners Of Azkaban, this film still ups all the things it needed too. It built more character development for all the characters in the Harry Potter world, it showed new wizards from places other than Hogwarts and it was way more dark. The inclusion of Robert Pattinson, David Tennant, Brendan Gleeson and now Ralph Fiennes thoroughly introducing himself as Voldemort was awesome as well. Overall this was a more darker, sad, sports filled films then the last three. But that doesn't make it bad. It is quite a great film.",1

638,8.0,"When the first Harry Potter film came out, I was still in high school. The day I saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire at the cinema was towards the end of my first term at university, a few months full of new experiences and learning to be independent. My friends and I took a drive down to the nearest multiplex to see The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe - and when that film was over, we spontaneously decided to stick around and see Goblet of Fire in the afternoon. At the end of the day, I considered The Chronicles of Narnia to be the better film, as Goblet of Fire - once again under a new director, Mike Newell - had felt quite clumsily adapted. Watching it again now, the flaws I recognised on the first viewing are still evident, but I do appreciate the whole thing a little more.",1

I'm able to forgive liberties with the plot because I realize that this is a movie, and if I wanted the entire plot, I could just read the book again. What makes movies successful adaptations of books is if they capture the mood and the themes of them, not the story word for word necessarily. Too many people disliked the film simply because it left too much out. If they put everything in, the film would be 5 hours long and would have cost $500 million. So I'm able to put up with stuff cut out.",0

When Alfonso Cauron took over for Chris Colombus with the third film, he screwed up the style, but now Mike Newell brings the style back to its roots.",1
642,8.0,"I've just come from seeing Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire. I Love'd it!!! I have a few nitpicks though. Firstly, The Weasley's were cut! I was looking forward to seeing for the first time Bill and Charlie, it would at least make sense that Charlie meet Harry because of the Draggons being shipped. but no. I wished also that they had shown The Quiditch World Cup! because I think it would have added to the film. I know it would have made it longer, but who the hex cares!!! It would have been great to see some Quiditch!! I was glad the twins had more screen time in this film, they were hilarious!! I wished though, that Harry giving them the money for their joke shop had been shown, not to mention Rita Skeeter and Draco's team up was cut! I liked how this film dealt with teenage Romance, going through the motions, and it got a lot darker. The Re-birth of Voldemort was a key moment, it is one of the great moments in Cinema History I must say. I thought Ralph Fiennes was amazing and completely encompassed the character. One of my favorite parts was when Harry's parents came to him in Spirit form and spoke to him, I was waiting for that and it came out perfect! the actors were wonderful as always. I especially loved Robiie Coltrane as Hagrid, He had a little romance in this film it was so funny when he was dancing with Madame Maxine, and she was taller than him! lol Great moment! I loved Daniel, Rupert, and Hermione as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The Yule Ballwas Great! I loved seeing Viktor Krum with Hermione! They were great in this film as always. I Loved Neville!!! he was awesome and really funny! I was glad he got more screen time this is more like Nevilles movie! I also liked seeing Draco but I wish he had more screen time, this is why I liked Chamber Of Secrets more, More Draco and it was more thorough, Christopher Colombus may have been a bit boring, but at least he was thorough and there wasn't much cut out of the films, Wheather or not there would have been as much cut out of this film if he had stayed on? We will never know. However Great Story, great Special effects, great actors this is a great film in the series.",1

Make Harry and Hermione like each other till the Order of the Pheonix? That's a good sign. But still, the Goblet of Fire focuses on Harry getting a date!

Wow, now that's what I call a Harry Potter flick. This actually my second favorite film in the series because of its new mind-twisting and well-learned plot, and new characters including Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, and the incredible Ralph Fiennes as the Dark Lord Voldemort. Anyways, ""The Goblet of Fire"" has its interesting moments with comedy, drama, action, romance, and a little bit of everything. That's what makes this movie a little bit more interesting, and shows that this particular film finally leads into more darker areas, and the series, then continues to more Potter flicks that have become more darker in the making. But dark movies are kind of what I like to see for some reason, and watching Harry Potter involved in all of this, is what I want to see.

The creature/ costume design, particularly of the dragons, mer-people, grindylows and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), were simultaneously creepy and terrifying.<br /><br />5. There is fantastic chemistry between Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger).<br /><br />6.

654,,One of the things most people grasp about the Harry Potter series is this. It grows up with it's readers it doesn't dumb itself down to it's audience it assumes that if you're there watching it then you must know everything you need to and it starts off at a breakneck speed not breaking once. There is a nice subplot involving Harry And Ron finding young love for the first time and there is the Danger of the Triwizard Tournment in Which Harry has been entered without his consent. The movie delivers on all points and Again Michael Gambon fills The LAte Richard Harris's Shoes as Dumbledore in this his second movie Gambon Owns the role and performs outstandingly. This is the movie that sets up the rest of the Harry Potter adventures in order to understand them you must see Goblet of Fire watch it and be amazed.,1

The series seems to be shedding its original ""childrens movie"" feel and is all the better for it. Some great characters join the established ones, and we finally get to see Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. This is also the point in the story where the books started becoming much bigger, and I must say that there are moments where it is very obvious that corners were cut and plotlines where streamlined to fit it all into a film, as it does feel disjointed at times.

I saw the preview (at 10:50) but it wasn't really worth it (finished it at 1:30am) If you've read the book, you'll be a bit disappointed. The main reason is other characters are excluded (like the rotten Durselys) and Katie Leung only makes a few brief appearances and says a few lines, which is a big disappointment. People flock to see Harry in action with the ladies, and what do you get? Nothing, she's just a gimmick. One of the book's main focuses is Harry's interest in Cho Chang, which gives the film it's cute appeal (and why most flock to see it)But instead, we have to witness the hate and hostility between Hermione and Ron, who has a seriously dodgy haircut. And come on, 2 and a half hours? Sure, the previous films were as long, but it seemed to go by quickly, this film just seems to drag on, Columbus and Cuaron did it better.

I've been a fan of the books for a really long time, so I had some high expectations for this movie, and I'm happy to say most of them were met. I really liked all of the humor injected into the film, especially the scene where Snape keeps whacking Harry and Ron with the books while they discuss dates for the Yule Ball (hysterical!) My only problem with the film was the rushed feeling in the beginning and the end. It might have been better to make two films, but this is still by far the best of the HP movies!",1

If you ask a non reader what the best Harry Potter film is, most will probably respond with Goblet of Fire. That's a rare trait in a movie. To the mainstream audience, Goblet of Fire is the definition of a summer blockbuster (though it was released in November). It has far and away the most and best action of any film of the series, and is a beautiful movie in its production design, music, and other technical aspects, but on a direction level, it's weak and on an adaptation level, it's even weaker.

It's just too bad that Newell's execution at dramatic points is not as good as Cuaron's. The acting is as good as ever with everyone in fine form especially Fiennes in a powerful part. Rowling's charming storytelling is still alive and well, but the characters have grown in this chapter. This causes more teenage hormones to come out, which plays against the dark, ominous fantasy. Newell does not combine the two well, so the two become uneven and lack balance. Newell gives a good effort, but he simply lacks the power of Cuaron's previous storytelling.",0
672,8.0,I was interested to see how on earth any writer & director was going to manage to condense such a large novel into 2 1/2 hours of film. I think they did a sterling job. They did the only thing possible and eliminated almost all of the sub plots paring the story down to its bare bones. I disagree that any who had not read the book would be left adrift. My son hasn't read it and found no fault with the continuity and enjoyed the film very much. As the story gets 'darker' in content with each new book I was not surprised at the 12a (UK) rating and wondered if the last one will have to be an 18! :) I have no complaints to make as there is no way that you can ever do a completely faithful version of a book. How can you when you are dealing with a completely different medium? Well done to all the cast and crew for a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait for the next one!,1

Now it seems like nothing else happened except for the Triwizard Tournament. The main characters had like one class during the entire year. They should've made the movie longer. Three hours may be a long movie, but it's better to make it long than make it seem like all this happened in few months instead of one school year. Seasons barely changed!",0

""Goblet of Fire"" is a refreshing, dark film that moves the series and the characters forward in a natural way.",0
675,8.0,"This movie easily has the most changes in terms of book-to-movie out of the four movies thus far. However, while there were many changes, this is also based on an incredibly long book so I totally expected it. Out of the changes, however, only one really bugged me. I hated what they did with Dumbledore's character. After Harry's name gets called by the goblet, he goes absolutely berserk in the movie and even shoves Harry. This never even almost happens in the book and is so outside of the character established already that it felt wrong. Nonetheless, if I try and look at it strictly from a moviegoer's perspective, it was probably the best of the movies so far. The acting was better than in the prior three, the plot progressed more smoothly, and the effects seemed better... especially the dragon sequence. While I wish they would've stuck more closely to the great book, they did do it justice. I would say I only deducted 2 points from the 10/10 maximum for the change to Dumbledore's character and for the fact that there seemed to be a couple of points in the movie where I would've missed what was happening if not for having read the book already. It's easy to get ahead of the movie somewhat if you already know the entire story so I might be exaggerating this effect somewhat but I thought it stood out. Still, this was a very good movie and I look forward to finishing the series.",0
676,6.0,"Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. I realize going into this I shouldn't expect brilliant acting from the kids, Daniel Radcliffe in particular, so the moments of below par acting aren't what turned me off to this movie. The main problem was that the characters were changed. Dumbledore lost control, something I would never have pictured him doing in the 4th book. Cedric was made out to be more of an ass than he is in the book. The storyline about Weasley's Wizard Wheezes was CUT! Now it's possible to have this line come back in the next movies, but much harder because there were never any mention of Triwizar winnings, so Harry never gave the 1000 Galleons to the Weasley twins. I realize there are time constraints for a movie and they can't show everything in the book, but they wasted time by adding new and unimportant things. Instead of Harry simply facing the dragon like he does in the book, there's about five minutes of him struggling without his wand. When he finally gets his broomstick, the dragon breaks free, and they go racing around the rest of the castle. It shows off the new technology we have for making special effects, but it doesn't further the story. Also, there was no point to show the students have a dance lesson, except for the sole purpose of getting an audience laugh when Ron has to dance with McGonagall.",0
677,7.0,"I can't say I was overwhelmed. I will emphasise this isn't a bad film, but it didn't blow me away; at best it succeeds in being slightly better than average. The roots of this film obviously lie much more in the previous film than the first two; this is defiantly a good thing, it reflects the changing tone of the book towards more sinister overtones. The castle is shrouded in dark clouds, 'Dark and difficult times lie ahead', indeed.",0
678,10.0,"Once again, the Harry Potter books receive a hugely successful film adaptation - with beautiful effects, good acting, gripping plots and situations and the great John Williams score. (However, this film was not composed by John Williams - but the score still was good.) But this film is probably Potter's best adventure yet - the film's 12A certificate is justified, and shows that the Potter films do not need to keep within limits. The ending is powerfully done, the underwater scenes in the middle are done eerily and with no flaws, the film once again stays loyal to the book, and the scene in which the Quidditch World Cup was attacked was not only done action-packed, but also harrowingly. This was probably the least forgettable of all the Harry Potter films - I sure do hope that number 5 will live up to the reputations set by this and the others, and that Sirius' death will be done in a way that is greater than anything in this film. The DVD release was worthy of this great film. The Goblet of Fire had a sharp script, beautifully done action sequences and effects, good acting (which proves that Richard Harris' death has not destroyed the film), and good direction - another huge success for the boy wizard. A stunning job! 10/10",1

For her, Goblet of Fire just omitted too much of Rowling's book and fluffed the parts that were left. I didn't mind it so much, though I haven't read any of the novels (I'm over 18) and for that reason the film seemed to me OK - though a little patchy and let down by Radcliffe's half-grimace, half-gurning style of acting.

Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",0

689,7.0,"This movie, about Harry Potter who finds himself competing in a hazardous tournament between rival schools of magic, but that he is distracted by recurring nightmares, is a decent fourth installment of the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011) with some different turns in several ways. First of all, the movie is mainly about this tournament, but the inner story is slightly different from the previous ones, I think. The relationship between Harry, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were changing. They were usually cooperating so good together, but as soon as they split apart in some ways, things got easily wrong. They fought and got jealous, but in reality, they were afraid of losing each other because they knew that things suddenly got really serious. They were everything for each other, and one mistake could change it all. It's kind of hard to watch because they are the perfect trio. However, the tournament itself was alright, but it takes up much time in the movie. A tournament has several rounds, and when the first round begins, you know there will be more, which is quite predictable in the long run. Anyway, I'm glad the tournament ended in a dark way, that Harry met Voldemort in his newborn, true form, and that Harry didn't win in a heroic and cliché way. So overall, a decent movie with a good ending.",1
690,10.0,"Yes, this was a beautiful adaptation. And you can clearly observe the fact that the director was English. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a bit too Mexican, while the first two films were simply American-like blockbusters. Though all of them were good. The main actors are giving a more mature interpretation of their characters, unlike Alfonso Cuarón's version where they were more rebellious and ""cool"".",1
691,,"Mike Newell's attempt to darken the tone of the Harry Potter franchise in 'Goblet of Fire' is welcome. Out go a number of the more tricksy background CGI embellishments, and a greater attempt is made to develop Harry's character. The opening is genuinely creepy, and there are more opportunities for Daniel Radcliffe to interact with, rather than react to, other performers. Ralph Feinnes as Voldermort is gleefully grim, works well with the young lead, and it would have been nice to see more of him. Newell references many a horror movie to good effect, but this, essentially, is where the film falters: the characters and the plot just aren't distinct enough to penetrate the darkness, and the inevitable lesson-learned  about the finality of death  is somewhat undermined by Harry having just survived his latest encounter with Lord V through the intervention of his long-dead parents (not to mention an odd bathroom encounter with the increasingly randy  disturbingly so as wee Danny's 16 and Shirley Henderson is 37  Moaning Myrtle. Radcliffe is a more confident presence than in previous ventures, but he doesn't have sufficient presence to carry the film. All in all a game attempt at redeveloping the franchise, and occasionally visually interesting  but let down by an insubstantial script and characters.",0
692,2.0,"I don't know if this is actually a spoiler but where were the house elves, dobby and winky? Also, Harry never sees Barty Crouch Jr. at the World Cup, why do they need to change that, it doesn't make sense to me. Also, They sat in the minister's box at the world cup, not in the highest seats possible, why change it? And since when was there a spell that propels Harry out of the water? Also, the dragon doesn't chase Harry around Hogwarts, in fact she stays close to her eggs because she is a nesting mother, that's right eggS plural, not just the golden egg, this actually presents more of a challenge than a dragon that is willing to leave her eggs. The only good scenes I thought were the graveyard scene and the opening scene, I though Voldemort was very well done. But what was with the maze? First, the maze is not the size of Rhode Island, it was contained within the Quidditch field, thus providing the stands for the viewers. Also, there was more than just wind and crazy branches in the maze. Where did the Skrewt go? Where was the Sphinx? Where was the fog that inverted the world when Harry walked through it? I also thought they should have put in the imperius curse, Moody putting it on the students, because that's a pretty cool part, the process in Harry's mind that is. I thought they could have made the movie 4 hours long and made it more true to the book and no one would have complained, I would have been happier. Also, what's gonna happen with Fred and George in the next movie, they didn't get the gold that Harry gave them in this one, so how are they going to start their shop? The grounds also make no sense, it seems like they just make up parts of the grounds that will fit the movie that aren't there when they first show the grounds in the movie.",1

Finally a half hour later the feature presentation starts I'm dancing in my seat as we see the WB shield fly at us and then the opening two minutes later my jaw drops and I ask ""who the hell is that?"" well I figured it out then the movie went down hill from there too much was left out of it.",0
694,8.0,I thought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best of the series. I was probably wrong.,1
695,6.0,"Before i move into a whole bunch of negativity towards this movie, i'll say that the special effects were great and they are probably the best i have seen in a while. If your hoping to read a good review on this film please do not continue reading. First off I can't say it in any nicer way so... Dumbledore sucked. It was the completely wrong actor to get for the role. His voice was horrible, his personality was very unlike the Dumbledore we read about in the books (which are one of the best series) and whats this stuff about when Dumbledore chokes Harry when Harry's name came out of the goblet. Yea Dumbledore seemed very calm. The lenght of the movie was just a shocker. The book is large and i don't expect them to fit it all in but it could have been possible to make two parts to it instead of just cramping random stuff in. If you have not read the book it will be impossible to get the story line. One of the things that disappointed me most was that the situation with the Dursleys didn't happen. It's such a laugh in the books and the movies where the Dursleys have something horrible happen to them. Instead they had to cut it out and just start of with Harry at the Weasleys. Hermione in this one was so over dramatic and she spent half the time upset. Shes not even like that in the books. I believe in the previous movies (which were excellent) she did a way better job. Overall i think this movie is really unsatisfactory and its nothing compared to the books.",0
696,8.0,"I saw the film on the day of release. i was so excited and couldn't wait much longer so i was glad to get tickets (the last 2). But i was disappointed with the fact that there was no Mrs Weasly or Ludo Bagman although the way the film is panned out he isn't needed. but it is very rushed in the beginning the rest of the film is a bit mixed speed, slow in places but rushed in the next. I know that they had to fit a long book in to a watchable film but there are some things that they cut they shouldn't of like how Barty JR became Prof Moody it was never explained clearly why he was Moody and not really Barty JR. and they didn't need to do all the flying around the roof tops with the dragon (but it was good) i'm also upset that there was actual swearing not just the normal ""Bloody Hell"" i did enjoy it but it wasn't to the book totally like they promised so if u want it to the book you may be disappointed",1
697,7.0,"Yeah it's a very good Harry Potter film. It's great when a movie can do a proper adaptation of a book whilst creating its own sense of creative expression. The dark nature of the film is pretty great, breeds a serious tone to the film that makes the story so much more meaningful.",1
698,5.0,"We all know that turning the pages of a book into a movie isn't easy, and this movie is proof of that. I have watched it many times, and I deeply regret the pages of the ""goblet of fire"" with so many good and interesting details, but when it comes to a movie, it's just a mess of confused and confusing events. Hogwarts is a wizarding school with a thousand years of tradition, and putting so much ""Muggle"" stuff in a movie, even the traditional costumes of real-life countries, a rock band? This is too much for me to accept. If he wanted to make a teen romance movie, Mike Newell could have made another one he liked, but instead, he ruined the Harry Potter saga. The confusing details, the absurd and boring dialogue, is just too much for an HP fan from part 1. If there's a bright spot in this movie, it's the interactions of the young characters together, those things still impress me. But as for the content of the movie, it's too boring for me. So much nonsense happens in the movie, like the part where Hermione encourages Harry before the underwater test, a dialogue that couldn't be more boring. And it doesn't make any sense. And then Professor Snape - who is not gentle and sweet but lets strangers sneak into the secret room to take all the valuable potions of herbs and feel nothing? And the funniest part is the part where Harry saves Cedric from the vines that bind him in the last maze, according to what happened, if Harry hadn't saved him he would have lived. Cedric following Harry doesn't help the development of this story. The director simply let Cedric die for nothing lol and indirectly turned Harry into a fake and a murderer. And even Harry didn't feel anything about it after that. Ridiculous. And the fact that Mad-Eye is actually the villain is also not well represented in the film, viewers are confused when following this character even though everyone knows it is the fake teacher after all. If they want to turn Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody into the villain, they should make the viewers feel that they are watching a logical story, instead of cramming meaningless lines for the characters. Lord Voldemort was too stupid to miss killing Harry just for the sake of a fair duel. In short, I'm pretty disappointed in this part.",0

In addition Goblet of Fire remains my favorite book, in my opinion the piece where Rowling is at the height of her literary prowess. So, for me, this movie had the deck stacked against it.",1

The movie could have been longer, but it did not have to be, Newell took so many liberties with the book, extending key scenes unnecessarily, ( task one- the dragon was ridiculous ), when he instead could have developed the ""story"" more... funnily that's what I thought a directors job was!! The scene with Sirius in the coals of the fire was not only wrong, completely, but overly long with a 30 second end that could have been used elsewhere, I just cannot put into words my despair at seeing the might of Hollywood fail so utterly in continuing what has become one of the most eagerly awaited and popular series of films for years. I can only hope that the next in the series is a step back to PoA which was masterful. And that whoever directs keeps sad old Michael Gambon in line!!",0

But there must be some kind of through line between them all, don't you think? Each film can't be shifted so drastically from one set of characters and Hogwarts settings to another! This movie is almost like it was made in a parallel universe/sound stage! Maybe I'm missing something. And don't EVEN get me started on the music!",0

Nobody will look back in 50 years and say ""wow that was excellent writing and film-making"" unlike Lord Of The Rings trilogy or the early Star Wars movies. But just my opinion, and a few I went with. For the young kids though, probably a good time I'm sure. Just too scattered, rushed at times and slow at others. Pacing is off for sure. Overrated reading, and Definitely overrated films I think. Could of used a 20+ minute time cut for pace reasons as well. But it's all a matter of opinion. Peace 'n chicken grease.",1
711,3.0,"This movie is extremely fast-paced and if you haven't read the book, odds are, you'll be confused out of your mind. If you have read the book, you'll be disappointed beyond belief not only because how much is left out, but what the movie's main focus is on: comedy and romance. The most built up scene in the entire movie is the Yule Ball sadly. The acting is far too over-dramatic and it does not have the same ""feel"" of Harry Potter as the other movies had. The plot and main storyline of the story is left to be in the background as unnecessary comedy, drama, and romance scenes are added in and extended whereas parts such as the Quidditch World Cup, Ludo Bagman, the Dursleys, several classes, and House Elves (just being a few) are left out entirely. I haven't looked through too many comments on this movie though I don't doubt that there are a few people on here commenting about how much the movie had ruined the book. That is to say the least, but the movie needs to be looked at as a movie itself and though it is packed with action and humor, it's main mysterious and dark plot line are thrown to the side for special effects and drama. I found this movie very disappointing because when I was watching the previews I finally had a feeling that they had finally got an HP movie right, but only found it to be the worst of all.

714,5.0,"Now let me start off by saying I haven't read any of the Potter books. But this was the worst HP movie I have seen so far. First of all, a large part of the mystique of the hp movies is that based on the scenery, you can't really tell what century or what year all the events take place in, but you usually have an old-time feeling throughout. However in this movie, there is even a scene with electric guitars! It made it feel too modern and ruined the mood for me. Also, there was too much action and almost no relevant dialog. I say ""relevant"" because there was plenty of talking that had nothing to do with anything. Also, I thought the Tri-Wizard tournament challenges were supposed to be uh, CHALLENGING? well in my opinion Harry got through them WAY too easily. Also, throughout the film there are so many parts that don't need to be included, and there are parts that you THINK might play some role later on but they don't, and you just end up getting confused. Of course i'm still a loyal HP fan but i'm hoping the next films are more similar to the first 3.",0

I missed so many wonderful scenes like the Quidditch World Cup (they didn't even say who won!). The storyline was crowded into too short time, one action scene by other.

The ball scene really didn't seem necessary other than to show that hideous frock Weasley had to wear. This one not as strong as 1-3, but I think it's better than 2.

Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't all that bad, butsome things really bothered me (*don't read if you haven't seen it yet and don't want to know what exactly happens*) When the movie started I was really excited. After five minutes I was sitting there, scratching my head. I wished I had the book with me, because I was like ""WTF is going on?"" Some of the beginning scenes seemed really unconnected to me and much of what happened in the book wasn't mentioned at all. Because of the choppy flow the beginning can be a bit confusing to those who have read the book many times and even more so to those who haven't. After another 10  15 minutes I relaxed and started to enjoy the movie. I thought it was pretty good until the Dumbledore-grabbing-Harry incident occurred. I must say that I was a bit shocked. Dumbledore was always portrayed as a friendly, grandfatherly figure. In this movie, Dumbledore was an old man with anger management problems. Not quite what I expected. I don't really blame the actor (even though I don't like him all that much) Some of the acting in this movie was a bit rough and overdone, most noticeably so when Ron and Hermione fought after the Yule Ball. Still, Radcliff's crying was *much* better that in the last HP movie (a cringe-worthy moment if there ever was one) and most of the actors were cooler (ahem*Neville*ahem). You can really see how they're growing up. I'll be really sad when they get too old to play the characters... Despite being the first PG-13 rated movie in the series I thought the humorous scenes acted as a really good counterweight to some of the more violent and scary occurrences the movie presented, making it darker than the others but still light enough. The graphics were good, music acceptable... (I must admit that the band at the Yule Ball surprised me and I'm still having mixed feelings about it.) Another thing that disappointed me was the absence of Ludo Bagman, who I really wanted to see. I'm glad I got to see Rita Skeeter -played by Miranda Richardson who was very convincing as the annoying (but funny) reporter. Another thing I noticed immediately was the lack of Voldemort's red eyes and (my personal opinion) the actors voice that kind of didn't fit with my image of the evil Dark Lord. ",0

While the plot is interesting, the movie suffers from the same affliction that ""Lord of the Rings"" developed, namely an over-reliance on prolonged action sequences and special effects. It is worth the price of admission to see it in the theater for the special effects, but it is an emperor without clothes and does not live up to the pre-release hype.

This was the only time in the first four parts that Harry had ended bleakly without the honor of victory. The troubled drums were unstoppable before this. The Quidditch World Cup camp fire, the black devil mark in the air, the top three competitions, this is destined to be an unsettled year, whether outside or in the soul , Harry met Laura Qiu Zhang, and the ignorant heart began to bump into the deer; Hermione met the Quidditch champion Krum and performed the Cinderella-style legend.

It is kinda dark and the third task is a tad bit scary. But the movie rocked!! I wanna see it again soon. The actor who plays Cedric Diggory is very hot, and so is Victor Krum. Hermoine looks so pretty at the ball. It is hard to remember that Harry and the others are only 14 years old because the actors look so old. They have grown up so handsome and pretty.

From here on out everything is a lot darker, and it still keeps some lighter moments to keep the tonal shift gradual. And whilst this isn't quite my favourite of the films, I still think it's pretty great. The visuals aren't as good as Cuaron's but they're still really interesting. The Triwizard Tournament is a really interesting setup for a film, and whilst the tasks aren't exactly great spectator sports (watching an empty maze and an empty lake doesn't sound particularly fun for everyone else) but they work really well on screen, and Mad-Eye Moody is yet another entry into the iconic Defence Against the Dark Arts Teachers. Ralph Fiennes also kills it as Voldemort and there are some really great jokes in here too. Despite being one of the longer entries, the film never felt boring or like it was dragging at all, and as I said before I just have a fondness for this story in particular. There are some questionable moments (DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE), and I do find it weird that when Mad-Eye is in the next couple of films we are just expected to treat him as a character we already know when, per the twist of this film, we've never actually met him.

Radcliffe and Grint are slightly weaker than the previous films as well, though Emma Watson has got to be the best of the teenage stars, as she convincingly portrays Hermione Granger unlike her earlier ones.",1
741,3.0,"i really, really wanted to like this movie. i love the books, as most people do. but. i don't know. just everything was not quite right. i know they had time crunches and its hard to get everything from the book into the movie. but. some things, it's like. it wouldn't take any more time to do. i really wondered if the director actually read the book. first off, the traditional HP music wasn't there. i love the music, and i think that the music is REALLY important. and when Cedric died and when harry came back from the graveyard, the scene didn't evoke any emotion from me. i cried when i read the book, but, i was like...um? this is corny music. also. Dumbledore's whole portrayal. he just seemed so agitated in the movie. he couldn't control his emotions. in the book, its not like he suppressed his emotions or didn't feel the guilt of everything that was happening, but in the book, a lot of is was shown through the eyes. and that he was a strong wizard...so he wouldn't get so frazzled. (for lack of a better explanation) i just didn't think that Michael Gambon did a good job at portraying the essence of Dumbledore's character. the acting on a whole... i just didn't like. as the story progresses (the books) the books are darker and darker. and i don't think Daniel, Rupert, or Emma really did a great job at it. it seemed forced. i don't know. you didn't feel the pain nearly as much as you should have. or how much of an impact it had on me in the book. it was superficial, you could say. they showed like...almost nothing of the World Cup and wasn't Barty crouches Jr.'s hair blonde? and i thought Moody's hair was dark brown. it wouldn't have cost THAT much to get actors with the color hair that was correct. there were just so many little things that didn't go parallel to the book. oh yeah. and Barty Crouch Jr. wasn't even in the first scene with Wormtail...in the maze, i mean, the maze was pretty cool, the helicopter scan, but, i mean. what was the thing with the moving bushes? i don't ever recall there being any hedges that strangled people. the spider, the sphinx, or the sparkly field wasn't there. but devil's snare was there. and that wasn't in the book. the graveyard scene wasn't even that intense either. when the reflections of all the people Voldemort killed came out, i remember in the book, they looked almost solid, almost real...but i could hardly see what they looked like. oh and they didn't show Bertha Jorkins come out. they left her out the of the movie totally. everything just didn't seem to scale very big. i mean. the crowd before they went in the maze....it seemed so small. it seemed more like a circus room with the band. oh and the lake looked more like a river. and the landscape didn't even coincide with the book. when harry looks in the pensive at the scene with his father, they were lounging around the lake on grassy knolls besides the lake. i don't know about you. but. those cliffs don't look like you could chill on them. maybe i'm a purist about the movie. but when there are so many blatant mistakes...even with small details. i liked the other three movies, just not this one.",1

744,4.0,I saw the movie yesterday at 6:20. The books get progressively darker. The movies do not. Too much was cut. The plot was all but missing. If I hadn't read the book I know I would not have followed the story. It's not a complete waste of time but it could have been done so much better. Basically a let down. The new Dumbledore comes off as more crazy than an eccentric genius. He is supposed to be the only person who Voldemort ever feared you're left wondering why? The plot was also not really resolved it just ended. I think one of the problems was that the people who are making the movies are still trying to target the younger audience but their audience is first off getting older and second these are not children's books. Rowling has said repeatedly that these are not children's books. The movies should reflect this. With more content the problems with the movie could have been fixed.,0
745,9.0,"This latest installment of the Harry Potter series is by far the best of the series so far. The characters and the school become a much more realistic view of adolescents and teenagers and dealing with life, love, and relationships. Harry Potter purists will definitely find holes in the plot, but ultimately the changes made were for the betterment of the movie. Newell does an excellent job at limiting changes to what was necessary to fit the time constraints, and most Harry Potter lovers will be able to forgive him. All in all, the movie has suspense, love, and laughs... and makes for a very entertaining time.",1
746,7.0,"First, I never read any of the books and I was not happy with the other 3 movies. I agree this was the best of the 4. But as it was with the other movies, I went because everyone claimed this is such a good story and each movie following was supposed to be darker and better. I know I am going to be in the minority but I am not impressed with the movie. It was indeed darker but not much else was different.",1
747,9.0,"This is the Potter movie that finally does justice to the book! Although several subplots were cut out, this movie still follows the 734 page book great! I saw this November 1st at a preview screening and wasn't expecting that great of a movie; boy was I wrong. This is by far the best movie in the series! It has great acting, great special effects, and a good plot (the best one in the book series). As for the pace of the movie, all I have to say is to be sure to be on time to the theater because this movie picks up right and the beginning and is a none stop roller-coaster ride. This movie mixes in humor very well for being the darkest one of the series, I often found myself laughing out loud at certain spots. Not to give anything away, but this movie is dark. If you are thinking of taking a young child, I would give you the advice that if they could handle the violence in Revenge of the Sith then they will have no problem at all with the violence/intense images in this movie.",1

I can't imagine how confused were persons who didn't read the book. The movie seems like a supplement for the book, instead of independent work. And there's more.... Harry Potter is not an action hero. Some stuff he does in Harry Potter movies are more far-fetched then Master Chuck Norris' and Steven Seageal's action moves, even though he has magical powers. I have a feeling that creators of this ""movie""(looks to me like long trailer), were trying to show much in short time, and ended up showing nothing. They should have done it like Kill Bill. In two parts, or a mini-series.",0
752,8.0,"The Harry Potter series just gets better and better. The first two movies weren't particularly to my liking, but at least the second one tried to include some darker, more interesting ideas. The third movie was absolutely excellent. The new director truly managed to capture the dark, slightly comic feel I've always expected from the Harry Potter books, but the third movie had some disappointing factors, including a confusing plot, loose ends and plot lines opened by the movie but left open, and weak performances from the kids in what were meant to be very dramatic scenes. The fourth installment, featuring yet another new director (Mike Newell, of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Donnie Brasco' fame,) improves on the disappointing factors that affected the third movie, and is a winner from the start.",0

Fleur and Krum had virtually no lines, and they just stood there half the time. Sirrius was almost completely absent too that was up with that? And did anyone find that little interaction between Rita Skeeter and Harry in the ""broom closet"" to be very VERY weird, especially on Skeeter's part? I really like Ralph Finnes though.. brilliant casting choice. And Cho...Wow.... just freakin' WOW!

Upon waking up, we see Harry at the Weaslys, spending time with his friends, Ron(Grint) and Hermione(Watson). Just 14 minutes in, we're back on the train for another year at Hogwarts. This year, Hogwarts is playing host to a legendary event, the TriWizard Tournament.

Everything that was not included were what I would consider make the book that extra bit special. The parts that were lucky enough to be included were good. I suggest that for anybody who really liked the book and has not yet seen the film that they do not go to see it as it will ruin something that you like, as it did for me.

Despite the absence of a few plot lines from the book (which had to be removed for film length requirements), the movie flows well and very, very quickly through the storyline of the book. Though Newell won't be directing the 5th movie (the directors are starting to look like the Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers in their shifting frequency) because he didn't want to deal with wrapping the 4th while starting pre-production on the 5th, I certainly hope he'll find time in his schedule for the 6th.",1
760,10.0,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a very good sequel to the films before it. The plot revolves around the big Triwizard Cup tournament and the 3 events that take place. It's a very interesting premise for a great movie with an awesome third act!,1

Furthermore, some of the good action scenes in the book, like the maze, are done very badly in the film. The whole maze scene lasts about three minutes, while in the book it lasted for half a chapter and had A LOT more detail. In the maze there was no blast-ended Scroots, no Sphinx, no Acromantula, and the maze decided to eat the champions instead. harry and voldemort are supposed to rise in the air. the world cup was completely retarded and it didn't even occur. and durmstrang and beubaton arrived 5 minutes into the movie. in the book winky was accused of cunjuring the mark and in the movie winky doesn't exist. this movie is incredibly retarded and i hate it.",0

Earlier, there was the delight of discovery, of exploring a realm full of quaint and whimsical features, with a dash of scary stuff now and then that soon passed. You wanted to go there! But the books and films bogged down in endless episodes of sheer horror and violence, the world of Hogwarts became gloomy and full of lurking menace, and onscreen we saw very ordinary-looking teenagers struggling through a shadowy, often terrifying world largely devoid of beauty and humor, with no apparent hope of any real change. An ominous lingering dread blunts the few moments of fun. I wouldn't want to go there! Splendid production values, of course, but overall these leave a bitter, decayed taste in one's mouth.",1

The Tri-wizard tournament is awesome! It also looks very realistic if you tell me! It's just one big adventure, where you can really dig in to. And I understand why Harry falls in love with Cho Chang! She looks great! I can't wait to see harry potter 5, because it seems to me that every new book is even better than the previous one! Great job J.K. Rowling and all the actors and directors of the movies! I love Harry Potter!",1

Not having read the book first and just seeing the movies, I have to say that Goblet of Fire was the best out of all the Harry Potter movies. It made me laugh, it made my cry, but most of all it made me intrigued. I enjoyed the movie very much, and I'm not speaking as a fanatic of the series, but as movie goer who enjoys watching generally good movies. I gave the movie a ten because I believe it deserved a ten. It was amazing: the special effects were awesome and the acting didn't seem like that of young actors and actresses, but of experienced and talented artists. I enjoyed the movie very much and I recommend it to everyone.",1
768,7.0,"This movie was all about Harry, Ron and Hermione. They got all the screen time. Which was good and funny at times, with Ron and Hermione having some awkward interactions. However this was at the expense of telling the overall story of good vs evil. Both in the book and in the movie the dark magic just comes in too late for me. This needs to be present in a much clearer way. Harry has the odd moment of his scar burning and his reocurring dream.",1
769,9.0,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is my favorite Harry Potter movie. There I said it. The reason is simple; it is the transition from a light magical adventure to a dark and serious fight. The first two were colorful and adventurous with a touch of evil. The third was different and a fresh twist to the plot. The fourth is the middle man and most important in the series. It is the first movie rated PG-13 in the series and you can tell it gets serious. This is The Goblet of Fire.,1
770,6.0,"I've always been pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to the Harry Potter movies. I do love the books, which have always been top-of-the-line fantasy. The movies, on the other hand, have straddled mediocrity. The first two felt quite empty, but the third brought the series up a notch with a great new atmosphere and a much darker tone. We could only hope the fourth would continue with this train of thought.",1
771,4.0,"""Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire"" is more of the same, ie it bears no difference at all with all previous Harry Potters. But was it an original recipe in the first place ? Hell, no. This is basically ""Wizard of Oz"" adapted for the age of Playstation, ""Labyrinth"" on steroids, ""Neverending Story"" on a high budget and produced by Steven Spielberg etc etc. In fact there's only one quasi-progression and that is a large dose of generic melodrama, as our young heroes approach teenhood and discover love. Cue dramatic strings. A meaningless and uneventful remake of Wizards & Warriors crossed with ""Gone with the Wind"" that deserves to go by unnoticed. Save your money.",0
772,9.0,"I'm glad to say that I'm not disappointed in this one. HP1 was okay. I haven't read the book when I saw it. HP2 was awful. It's the worst Potter film for me. And honestly, I was slightly disappointed in the first viewing of HP3. But then, the more I watch it (on DVD), the more I realize that the third Potter movie was the best of the three. In terms of storytelling and character development, Azkaban is far better than the first two. The Harry-Flying-With-Buckbeak scene is one of the best scenes IMHO. It is emotional and the music is great. Now comes the fourth in the series, The Goblet of Fire.",0
773,9.0,"I'm not that big on technology as a whole, but IMO this film was a turning point for the franchise when it comes to special effects, it was beautifully done.

I just have one question though: what's with the haircuts?",1
774,9.0,"This movie is on an equal level compared to most of the other Harry potter movies. It is the most comparable to the 3rd part. There is a very similar feeling connected to it. Probably because they are only separated by 1 year from each other. The 3rd and 4th part are more mature, but less funny. In the 5th and 6th part, the movies change even more in that way.",1

776,7.0,"Harry Potter is the fourth movie of the Harry Potter franchise and this time Harry Potter must survive three dangerous tasks after his name gets put in the Triward Tournament. For what its worth this movie isn't actually that bad when I watched it, but there are some improvements that it could've made. Harry Potter and his friends are now teenagers then they were in the previous three films so now that they're older that means the danger and destruction has increased as we see Voldemort making his comeback and sending a message. However, I couldn't help but notice that they focused on that a lot as if I was watching some 80s or 90s high school movie. And we do get that, but it takes a really long time to get there. I feel like the writers for were split into two teams. One team creating the action and tension building and the other for creating humor, however the humor falls flat to the point where it falls flat. I know that this is supposed to be a kids movie and that you have to add some humor to the franchise so it's not one hundred percent dark and gritty, but come on at least don't try so hard. I felt that they didn't focus enough on the Triwizrd Tournament as it did deliver the danger, but they could've at least cranked it up just a little bit. I remember the book describing the Triwizard Tournament and adding details here and there that we didn't see in the movie. Overall, I will say that it is entertaining to watch and I don't hate or think it's the best one in the franchise, but it could've been better.",0
777,5.0,"This movie if one could call it a movie was somewhat depressing for many facts some being that jumps from section to section with incredible space there is no build up to any kind of climax. Newell screwed up horribly on this and should be fired, in my opinion combine the abilities of Chris Columbus, and Alfonso Cuaronin the fifth one to hopefully recover from the tragedy of this film. I will admit though that some of the scenes were very beautifully done but that does not make up for the constant go - stop motion of the movie. Bloody horrible. Bah. In there attempt to not make the movie to grown-up is blasphemy the characters are growing up so must the characters in the movie. The movie only flows at the end so if you want to waste money on watching it over and over and say its the best yet, would be tarnish the good book. All in all the movie is maybe 2 stars tops 2.5.",0

This movie just seemed to be a bit darker, it's not a big deal but it kind of messed the movie up for me. The biggest thing was the lack of logic in the movie. The dragon's weren't supposed to leave the arena, it was safely guarded. Now we have people making jokes about Hogwarts being unsafe when that was never the case. They just wanted to entertain the watchers with beautiful visuals but it never made sense. A lot of things weren't right like Dumbledore's personality and how the maze was changed up.

What about the killing of Crouch Jr. and the ministry not believing that Voldemort is back? This really has upset me because this was my favorite book in the series and now my least favorite of the movies.

After all, no Tolkein to compete with, so all the fantasy buffs must surly come to this movie, right? Well, things have changed, as Hermione (Emma Watson) points out. CGI is no longer new, it can be seen in virtually every movie. So a film director, when choosing CGI, must decide whether or not to put more emphasis on it, to compete with the special effects of Tolkien's Secret Son Peter Jackson and his film ""King Kong"" or to put emphasis on the story, and compete with the allegorical story lines of Tolein wanna-be ""The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe.""

In fact Goblet almost makes the first movie (and almost any recent movie that's heavy on sfx) look like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. In fact, I'd say these movies are starting to look as good as Lord of the Rings, but just starting. It really is a beautiful picture to behold. The establishing shots are truly majestic and the tighter settings are well detailed.

This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation.

Watching the movie, it seemed overall the same than the first. Then I read the third book (the best one), and noticed that the adaptation was a little rushed and mostly like a summary.

I am afraid the rest of us, not meeting that criteria, are left hanging out to dry. This was another example of lots of CGI, but little emotional connection with the characters. There was also a noticeable lack of action, at least, compared to the previous movies. I am not a slavering Potter fan, but I did find all of the other movies entertaining. Since Rowling has absolute control over the movies, I can only assume that she intended this one to be realized in the way that it was. The CGI is stunning, but the story, pacing and emphasis leave much to be desired. There is no excitement when he fights the dragon - none when he is running in the maze - and not much more when he faces Valdemort. What happened Harry - have you been snorting fairy dust? I think this movie goes wrong for a general audience, but does very well targeting young girls. Goblet may fair better on a second viewing or on cable or DVD. It was interesting to see everyone older, but nothing was ever done with those possibilities.

796,2.0,"First of all, I am a great fan of the Harry Potter books. When I see a HP movie, I expect it to live up to the books, even if it isn't necessarily the exact same. Goblet of Fire miserably failed to live up to the book, which isn't even one of my favorites of the series. The most crucial plot line of the whole story wasn't even properly explained. That would be the whole thing with the Crouch son and his father. One of the most important scenes is when he is interrogated by Dumbledore and confesses everything. I understand they have to skip parts, but that was the scene that explained EVERYTHING that had happened for the last year. This movie was really about the special effects and not the story lines. The scene with the dragon was highly unnecessary and kind of boring seeing as how it dragged on Way too long. They also left out important things such as Rita Skeeter being an animagus, seeing as she comes back in the next one being blackmailed by Hermione. Winky was very important too, but seeing as they decided to forget about that whole storyline i guess it doesn't matter. Ludo Bagman wasn't that important but still, to not even mention him? They are going to have a very hard time with the next movie, trying to fill in the holes that were dug with Goblet of Fire. The next movie will be confusing for non book readers because they weren't told what happened in the this one. Also, the guy who plays Dumbledore is AWFUL. Not saying hes a bad actor, but he SOOO isn't Dumbledore in any way. No way would Dumbledore grab Harry by his neck, even the Dumbledore from the movies. And what the hell was with that maze? How weak was that? If i put aside my feelings over the movie compared to the book, it still wasn't good. If you want to be awed by special effects and thats it, this may be the movie for you. But if you want a movie that has a fully developed story line, you will be disappointed by this movie. Worst of all of them. Truly not the spirit of Harry Potter.",0
797,6.0,"Damn. Just saw it. I think it's actually the best of all the films, until now. But, yeah, a GREAT BUT. It's not really a movie about the book. Its just a movie INSPIRED by the books, at least, thats what seems to me... Crucial characters aren't there, and the story is extremely different than the story from the book. For an example: The Quidditch Worldcupmatch, is gone. Only an intro, and then you'll see Ron and Harry celebrating. And, Dobby and Winky are also not there. During the whole movie, they aren't there!! And Dumbledore is I am Sam meets Jack Sparrow. Since when is Dumbledore an aggressive gay? There are two things, what make the movie worth seeing. The first is the great soundtrack. And second, Emma Watson. Damn, she's hot. The reason why my rating isn't a one out of ten, is that the story is so brilliant, and the specials are amazing. The acting isn't awful at all, it is even pretty good. So, go and watch the movie, but don't expect the greatness of the books...",1

Even within the imaginary world of the storyline, things don't seem to make sense. The main mover of the plot is a gruesome tournament among wizard schools which is over the top and doesn't serve well as a basis for a plot. What did I expect? I thought this might develop from the earlier charm of the first movies to something more thoughtful as far as story, development of character, and development of the fictional background for these stories.

811,,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was my personal favorite movie in the series for a long time. It has some great scenes, the underwater lake and return of voldemort are amazing examples. With a suburb original soundtrack I think is better than any other in all 8 films. Unfortunately where this one falls flat is the logic of the story, it goes past the point of just saying ""because of magic"" as a reason for how certain things work and defies common sense. One example is when Barty states that Harry is under a magical binding contract to stay in the tournament although later we see Dumbledoor discussing whether they should pull him out. And even worse they decide to do nothing. Speaking of which, Dumbledoor.... he is way too out of character constantly shouting, it directly contradicts the Dumbledoor in past and future installments of the series. Also why was the dragon able to so easily escape from its chains? And for the latter two events what was the point of the school showing up to sit in spectator chairs if they can literally see and do nothing the whole time. And then comes the various cliche moments scattered throughout. Another disappointment, not necessarily with this film but with later ones are the characters that were never brought back. Of course condensing such a big book into a feature-length film was always going to disappoint some fans, but it still would have been good to see some of them return.",1

It seemed to me they followed the way of the awful Lord of the Rings stacking separate episodes of the book in a senseless sequence and filling screen time with enormous special effects. Well, now I should admit I was completely wrong. Goblet is a quite tense movie. It has its own pace, breathing deep and breathing hard running intact with the action. And then the details are what pleased me most. They are the point of any movie, ""words"" of movie language. And the creators of Goblet managed to put the book into this language and not to spoil the main plot line. The only weak point I noticed is that maturing of the heroes goes somewhat apart of the action. Still this does not spoil the movie much. I rank it 8 and believe Goblet is keeping on the way Cuaron had chosen with his Prisoner of Azkaban.",0

It showed amazingly well the problems of adolescence, and I can't tell you how many times people in the theatre were ""aaawwing"" and ""oooing"" when Cho couldn't go to the Yule Ball with Harry, or Ron gave Harry a look that rivaled with that of a Basilisk. The special effects were not especially spectacular, but they were very very cool. And the movie, although very dark and being the first in the series to be rated PG-13, was very humorous throughout, right up until the point where Harry, Cedric, Krum, and Fleur entered the final task by going into the hedge maze. The scene where Voldemort comes back was incredibly well done, and so was the scene where Harry and Voldemort's wands connect and the ghosts of Voldemort's kills come forth from his wand. I thought it could have used a little more dramatism. When Harry brings back Cedric with the Triwizard Cup Portkey, and he yells at everyone that ""Voldemort's back!!"" amidst cries of anguish over Cedric's death, the movie seemed to lack a little bit of the importance about how HORRIBLE Voldemort coming back was.",1

828,6.0,"I only give this movie a 6 out of 10 because it has to do with the Harry Potter series which I am dedicated to. I really felt that the movie missed the balance between the heartfelt comforting scenes contrasted with the darker elements. The film was quite dark and harried throughout, any fun and happy scenes were drained out of it. It felt very edited at times kind of like the most recent disappointing Star Wars trilogy. Like that trilogy it lacked in genuine character development that was evident in the first three HP movies as well as in the books. HPGOF was my favorite HP book but this movie is by far my least favorite of the films. With all of that said, there are some nice elements and decent acting in general. I quite enjoyed the dragon scene in the triwizard tournament, it was really scary and exciting, as was the end of the movie. I just wish they had taken more time to build emotion rather than just going from one point to another. Even with Cedrick's death I wasn't really that moved, where as in the book it was quite startling. The film really needed to be made into two movies and SLOWEEEEDDD DOWWWNNN to do justice to the book. The other complaint I will say is the new Dumbledore really doesn't capture the character the way the original actor from Movie 1 and 2 did. The new Dumbledore is very aggressive and almost violent at times. From reading the books, I always thought Dumbledore had quite a bit more self control - he was wise and balanced not so hectic. All in all, the movie was entertaining despite my criticisms, certainly better than most of the crap that is released to theaters these days. Here's hoping the next film is better.",1

832,10.0,"The tradition is not broken - the 4th Harry Potter movies is the best one yet, full with terrific action, dazzling plot twists, stunning visionaries and typical ironic British sense of humour. Dan Radcliffe is great. I have always liked how he portrays Harry Potter, but in the 4th movie he is simply amazing. If he is so young and can shows so well the emotions of his character, he has a bright future ahead of him. I wish him well. He deserves it. But the other actors were very good, too. As a Bulgarian I can't help, but feel proud with our boy Victor Krum. He looked like a tiger in this movie, dark and dangerous. And the dragon, oh, the dragon! Finally someone to show how a dragon should be made! His chilling fight with Harry was extraordinary. My only complaint is about Voldemort. He looked too disgusting in my opinion. On the other hand this is what Voldemort is - a wizard, who thinks himself great, but actually is a pathetic cruel creature, which takes pleasure only in suffering. Overall, the 4th Harry Potter is the best one yet and tied with ""The Revenge of the Sith"" as a movie of 2005. Kudos for Dan Radcliffe, Mike Newell and the others, who created the magic!",1

I know to some, this represents value for money, but any film that lasts longer than it takes to fill your bladder is a definite no-no for me on the big screen, simply cos you are going to miss something and whats the point of that. Short of being dehydrated and drinking nothing for the best part of three hours you will need a bathroom break. Will be a superb film just like the others on DVD, this is cos there's a pause button at home if only there was one for the big screen lol! The bit that sticks in my mind, is during the first challenge when harry falls off his wand broom and the dragon claws its way across the castle roof, absolutely stunning graphics and a great all round film.

As for the acting, it was alright, but the fight between Ron and Harry was a little boring, and I didn't realize that Hermione would be so heartbroken over the Krum/Ron situation-- she cried! But I loved the bath scene with Harry... except for Mrytle-- she was just being sad and pathetic there. I do think that they did a very good job with the maze scene, but Voldemort said Dumbledore's line about love, which made me sad.

I'm 14, the age of Harry and his friends, and i find the movie very real and something i really can relate too. I mean, the books are obviously, fantasy, but it's about characters that you know and love so much and them being not perfect is part of what makes Harry Potter so great. I'm not saying that the first two movies weren't good, but i think it just doesn't have that key aspect that the 3rd and 4th ones do, but especially the fourth. In the first ones, I would say, ""Wow, well there's something that will never happen to me!"" but in the fourth one, some of the things in there have happened to me and those around me. But, of course, what also makes this movie absolutely amazing is, of course, the acting. I have to say that I was immensely and pleasantly surprised when i saw what great actors/actresses this trio has turned into. Especially Daniel Radcliffe. I'm not saying the others aren't brilliant as well, but he's the one that is holding this whole movie on his back. He, of course, is the actor who plays Harry Potter. He did a job very well done. And, of course, the special effects. Everything was so nicely done. When Voldermort returned, you could see his backbones and ribs, and every bone move when he was re-born, and it was all done with the computer. And the dragon was absolutely magnificent.

Nothing really big. Actually, I think that PoA was more pivotal than this one. However, the movie was actually pretty good. I did like Goblet of Fire, but it's my least favorite entry in the series. But, I liked the way the movie was quite a bit. If the actors could just freeze time, and stay looking this way until the last one is released, I'd like it. They look great in this movie, and their acting is at the top of their game. Ralph Fiennes is scary, noseless, and awesome as Lord Voldemort. The whole graveyard scene was awesome, and I think it's better that they stayed on the ground when Priori Incantatem takes place. The special effects are great, and the movie is all around wonderful.

857,8.0,I saw this movie yesterday and it was in one word:great! The first half of the movie was like a comedy as there was lots of jokes thrown in but after that things got dark. I found the scene when the statue was holding Harry and Voldemorts rebirth from the baby into a horrible evil man to be done well.Also the challenges that Harry faced in the triwizard tournament were very cool.I especially liked the first challenge when the contestants had to get the golden egg from their dragon.At one stage I thought Harry was not going to complete the challenge but he did.Also I liked the maze challenge as the item they touched was a port key and led them to Voldemort and then Harrys friend died. The acting was average at first but got better and the effects were very well done. I highly recommend this movie but be warned parents please do not take little children to this movie as it will scare them and they wont be able to concentrate for 3 hours.,1
858,10.0,"If I would pick my best movie i would pick this movie. I've heard people say a lot about it, then i watched it and thought it was the best! Daniel Radcliffe and Lord Voldemart Rocks! Here are some things you should know when you watch it! Spooky Action Suspense I rated it 10... for those 3 things! Hope you like it! Harry Potter and The Sorcerous Stone was 0k... Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets was fine... Harry Potter and the Prisnor of azkaban was excellent... and now the best movie ever Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire... I can't say but it just rocks!!! The only part I liked was of course... every part of the movie! From hours to millisecond's!",1
859,8.0,"It would be impossible to film the whole of the book in one movie. It would end up being a trilogy, however people have still been moaning that there was heaps missed out. All I can say is thank goodness the Quidditch world cup was glossed over. There is only so much Quidditch one can take. I actually found the last movie left more important stuff out. I had to explain to my husband a few details last time but this time he said he got the gist of it but found that not a lot happened (Which is true I suppose).",0
860,3.0,"I am begging on me KNEES to have Chris Colombus come back!!! I am so horrified and angry at the new director. He went WAY too fast. In the beginning, Mr. Weasley was supposed to send Harry a letter, telling him he will pick him up for the World Cup, then Mr. Weasley comes by floo powder to come pick Harry up. None of that happens. They start with Harry already at the Weasley's. Also, the World Cup lasted less than 5 minutes!!! They didn't even show the veelas nor Winky-which is a key character in the next books. Overall, the crew skipped practically 1/3 of the book..And made the rest up!! They were also supposed to figure out why Rita Skeeter has been able to get all that gossip, she a flippin animagus...she turns into a beetle. This is the worst Harry Potter movie yet.",0
861,9.0,"Let me start off by saying this: my review is NOT about how well Mike Newell left in every minute detail from the book, or how much the screen writers had to leave out. This review is on how the big screen adaptation captures the spirit of the novel while coming alive in its own way on film. That being said, ""The Goblet of Fire"" pulls off a feat I thought was impossible and it compresses the hefty book into a two and a half hour movie. It's brilliant.",0
862,3.0,I was disappointed from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I doubt that even if I have not read the book in advance I would like it. It doesn't offer anything new  and I have to say that I was bored till its end. The length of the movie is more than enough to allow more detailed representations of the events in the book.,0
863,9.0,"This movie was fantastic. The story is great. The effects are cool and the acting is cool. Danial Radcliffe is doing fine, Rupert Grint overacts, Micheal Gambon just isn't Richard Harris, and Ralph Fiennes was way off. I don't think that him running around was the smartest choice. Also, I was not too happy that they left out Barty Crouch Jr.'s fate. The star of the show though, is Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody. He was zany and wild and he was excellent. Plus when Harry brings back Cedric's body is a very depressing scene. The tasks were cool and the Dark Mark was fun, but I will always get a kick out of Moody turning Malfoy into a ferret.",1
864,9.0,"It took me a while to like this film. Five years and four viewings to be exact. When I first saw the film, like many other ""Harry Potter"" fans, I held it very accountable to its source material, so, naturally, the film did not hold up in my view. However, thanks to a few years of time and a push from a couple of friends who felt they considered this the best of the ""Harry Potter"" films, I decided to give ""The Goblet of Fire"" a clean slate and rewatch it. Lo and behold, I was surprised how much better the film played out.",1

I really like how it really relates to the book where for some movies if they have a book, they never go along with the book, but this one definitely does! This is a great movie for anybody! I think that if they didn't have such phenomenal actors and actresses this movie wouldn't be half as good as it is! This is a really good sequel to the third book! Once I saw Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire I wanted to see it over again, it was definitely a really good movie! Everybody else in my family loves this movie so it is definitely good for all ages! In conclusion if you haven't seen this movie you definitely should!",1
868,7.0,"GOF left out the things about HP that make it great- that's the real problem- Hollywood always makes sacrifices but this seemed more like a theme ride than a thoughtful, dark representation of the book. It did seem rushed from one action sequence to the next and all of the details that make the world of HP come alive for a reader were missing from the film- mostly. It isn't possible to duplicate a book in a film but this didn't even try- it used SFX instead of plot and character dev- shame. It is ironic that CC stayed really faithful to the text of the first 2 books but was lambasted for being too boring- but the books and characters have changed from the beginning - each director has tried but there was clearly no respect for the source material.",0

874,3.0,"It was a terrible, awful mistake not to convince Cuaron to direct this movie. Mike Newell obviously has a VERY different vision of what a Harry Potter movie should look like - think Baz Luhrman for tweenies - and he was obviously unwilling to sacrifice any of that vision for the sake of consistency. There is no reason why he could not have filmed the sequel to Prisoner of Azkaban in his own style while remaining true to the central characters, as directors have done with the previous three films. Instead, he directs GOF as if it's part of an entirely different series of books, resulting in so many inconsistencies and loose ends that the film becomes unwatchable.",0
875,10.0,"This movie is indeed, the best out of the series yet. The Harry Potter movies are getting better and better each time! :) Mike Newell for PRESIDENT! He has done a great job directing GOF, and the actors and actresses are brilliant in this movie. Dan, Rupert and Emma are improving in their acting and they're much better in this movie. Harry looks so dashing in his dress robes! Ron is as funny as ever. Hermione is pretty and elegant in her pink dress. Fleur is really great, i think they did a great job choosing Clemence as Fleur. Viktor is as i expected, or even better. Cedric is by far, my favorite character in this movie! He IS SO SUAVE and handsome :) and i think Robert Pattinson has done an excellent job portraying Cedric. Cho is pretty and sweet!

880,9.0,"I went to Harry Potter and the goblet of fire on the premiere 18.th November in Norway. I have read all the books so far and was looking forward to this movie, but I got a little disappointed for the first time. First of all the plot from the Quidish world cup, when the dark mark appeared was changes too much from what happens in the book. So that just made it to bad. We also got introduced to the real bad guy to fast, in the book it takes longer time, and we can not know who made the Dark mark at first, here we new right away. That spoiled much of the excitement of watching the movie. And for the second reason characters who was important for that plot in the book wasn't even mentioned in the film. We did not meet the Dursleys, we did not meet Mrs.Weasley, the house-elfs and they where important I thought at least.",0
881,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best films of the year and the best Harry Potter movie. As I fan of the books, I knew I had high hopes that this movie would great despite all the changes. I was not disappointed. Newell and Kloves do an excellent job translating the 734 page novel into a two and a half hour movie. The theme, despite being the darkest yet, has some humorous parts that balance the movie well. The performances by the three young leads Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson was amazing and captured the teen angst of the movie, as were the performances of the other young actors. The adult performances were done well, especially Brenden Gleeson who was amazing as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody. As great as the performances were, the special effects are equally amazing. The three tasks and the epic climax will leave people in awe at not only how well done they are, but for fans of the book, how well they are translated. If there was one disappointment in the movie, if you could call it a disappointment, was the music. Patrick Doyle's score was good, but it was no John Williams. All in all, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazing movie that is a contender for best film of the year.",1

883,9.0,"I went to see the fourth harry potter movie yesterday and i found it rather intriguing. I am a harry potter's books fan and i was very disappointed at the fact that Winkie never showed up, the fact that important explanations were missing and personal relationships poorly explored. All I got from the movie, let's say 80%, was action, the tournament occupies the screen for most of the time. But, and there is always a but, the scenes that were filmed were great, flawless, powerful. Newel made a great job, but i must say that the script could have been better. Rupert is great as Ron and Emma was a surprise, as for Daniel.. he grew up..as an actor and as a boy. I believe that the actress casted as Fleur could be more magnetic, i couldn't see none of the Veela's blood in her, except for the fact that she is blond... It was in my opinion the best HP movie... but I considered it a high treason to the book. As I say... I couldn't make up my mind...",1

There were less creatures than expected, but for the few that there were, You know who included) were all really well done....The directer of this film should be shot and replaced by the previous director of the Prizoner of Azkaban. I know that sounds harsh, but watch the flick and find out for yourself. It's a fun movie if you're not a die hard fan of the series.....but i wouldn't stand in line for an hour to see it.

889,10.0,"I watched this film last night and I was awestruck by how brilliant it was. I was worried after comments on the film that they were going to leave out a lot of the important bits of the book but I think they did the book justice. There was so much emotion in the film and not once did I think 'oh my god they have left an important part out'. They include all the teenage feelings with Harry, Ron & Hermione and the ending was the real climax of the film. I was annoyed to see that a report in a paper I read said that 'Daniel Radcliffe's acting is still as wooden as his broomstick'. That I can assure you is not true. He has grown on the films and has made the character his own. I will say that he has done a marvelous job in all of the films and especially GOF. As for Emma Watson, she is a pleasure to watch on the screen and she gets better every time you see her. Rupert Grint is another charm to this movie. His quirky comments and reactions are enjoyable to watch. I would like to see these three complete all the Harry Potter films as I do not think that the films would be the same without them. One good side is that as the actors get older and the stories get darker, it will bring more of the adults to the cinema. I'm 21 and I love reading the books and watching the films. I think JK Rowling has created a brilliant world of imagination for adults and children to enter into and the film makers have done a great job of making the films from this. My overall verdict is that this is one film that you do not want to miss. Even if you have not read the books, you will understand the film with no problem. My congrats to the cast and crew on making this spectacular, thrillingly enjoyable film.",1

892,1.0,"I looked forward to this installment of the Potter series with anticipation and hope that the magic in Rowling's story would be present. The film fails in this because it the story is told up front and close. All depth to the story is fuzzy and blotted out. Missing are countless characters in the storythat effect Harry Potters life. The Ghosts, Dobby, The Dursley's, Mrs. Weasley, and as always Peeves the Poltergeist. (In my opinion, if the dragon scene had been presented as Rowling's wrote it, there would have been time to add some of the MIA's.) Key elements of the story are missing, other elements are incomplete, and the director and the writer have taken great liberties that are uncalled for. People come to see Rowling's story visually expressed; anything else is a waste.",0
893,7.0,"This is a great movie overall, even though it does waver quite a bit from the book. The three tasks were done very well, and the whole atmosphere of the film matches that of the book, which I always think is important.

894,,"Having read the first three books and being thoroughly unimpressed, I was unsurprised by this film. Knowing before-hand that John Williams was not continuing his role as composer for the film, I should have expected that any charm the earlier films had held would evaporate with this fourth instalment. The story itself is incredible enough-why would any school permit a tournament in which students are so frequently killed?-but compounded with the seemingly tacked on sub-plot of romance which is never completely fulfilled, the film itself ends up being an incredulous piece of garbage, even within its own setting. While the film looks extremely impressive, the set design is not enough to distract from the flailing plot and the unconvincing characterisations",0

There didn't seem to be much talking either. I wouldn't have minded having an intermission for a two-part film, and I don't think Harry Potter fans would oppose either. The music wasn't as captivating as the other movies, which is probably because John Williams didn't compose the music for this film like he has in the other ones. I do hope that he does for the next film. I wasn't a huge fan of the other movies, but they were better than this one. I think that if you are a hard-core book fan, you will probably be disappointed in the movie since it is missing so much. If you only see the movies, be prepared to be completely confused. Decide for yourself if you like it or not, but I was highly disappointed.",0

The acting is impressive giving that the actors who play students have never acted in anything before this series ever (few exceptions). It has a good mix of action and special effects and living life as a teenager. I was however disappointed on the quantity of content left out that was in the book: The Dursly's, Dobby, The Quidditch World Cup (they never actually showed the game), Karkarof's Fleeing at the end, Hagrid's Blast Ended Screwts, and probably many more things that I can't remember. The maze sequence was a little messed up cuz they didn't have the 30 foot spider or any creatures or spells to test the contestants skills, they simply had the maze try to eat them or something, I dunno. The climatic grave yard scene wasn't exactly as I expected it, but still extremely good, exciting, and suspenseful. I'm glad they decided to go all out and make this installment PG-13 because if they hadn't, the grave yard scene would have been pretty crappy. I think they should have made it longer, or even into 2 parts to extend and add some scenes like with the Dursly's, the World Cup, and the Veritiserum scene with Crouch Jr./Moody. I saw it in IMAX which made it better than it probably was (big ass screen, and 12,000 watt surround sound system). If you're a die hard potter fan, you may be a little disappointed, but this is a very, very good movie. See it.",1

The 2 best in the series so far after the Sorcerer's Stone.",0
903,7.0,"I enjoyed watching the newest Harry Potter film and recommend you view it as well. Overall, the movie captured the main points of the novel, but left out the factors that led to them. Such as the house-elves. The house-elves played a key role in the novel and because they were taken out of the movie, several scenes had to be altered. The actors and actresses were superb! I was a little shocked when Dumbledore seized Harry the way he did when his name came out of the Goblet though, because in the novel, no such reaction took place from Dumbledore. Aside from that one scene though, everyone was great. I impress my recommendation that the next 3 novels be released on film, containing the actors Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe, and actress Emma Watson. They all fit the description given by Rowling and are wonderful. As well, the new characters, Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory, along w/ their schoolmates and Professors, Mad-Eye Moody, and so on, were terrific! These movies will be cherished for ages and keep up the good work!",1
904,,"It's no easy task, adapting a 700+ page novel into a film that can be viewed in a single sitting. When producing Goblet of Fire, the studio originally intended to split the book up into two films and release them a few months apart, a la Kill Bill. Director Mike Newell talked them out of this idea, and condensed the book into a single film, which moves at breakneck speed, cuts out at least half of the sub-plots, and still manages to run over two and a half hours.",0
905,6.0,"Yes, I liked the special effects. Yes, I liked the improvement in skill of the actors. However, the director needs to be slapped around for allowing the Dumbledore character to be completely misrepresented. He is supposed to be a calm, level, even-tempered ""rock"" for Harry in his times of trouble. This character needs meds. How very disappointing. I took my 12 and 13 year-old children to see the movie tonight and none of us were happy with the film. Of course, HP fans will need to see it. However, we all believe that it lacked depth, went WAY too fast through important background material, and neglected the sub-plots beyond forgiveness. In summary, we were all disappointed in the film.",0
906,4.0,"I had high hopes for this latest instalment of the Harry Potter series, most especially after the superlative production of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with Alfonso Cuaron at the helm. Cuaron's film was a genuine cinematic treat, often visually stunning, darkly atmospheric, strongly-acted, emotionally satisfying with a realistic central theme charting Harry's personal growth and his evolving sense of identity. Emma Watson was excellent here as Hermione, and her scenes with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), most particularly during the brilliantly directed Time Turner sequence were a stand-out. There were multiple visual clues, gags, motifs, clever filmic transitions to delight during this film, ensuring a multi-layer narrative - more than mere popcorn action and trite adherence to the book. ",1
907,5.0,"The screenplay for this movie really ruined it for me. There were major things missing and things in it that weren't even in the book. I re-read the book again right before going to see the movie - big mistake. Why didn't we see more of Ron's other brothers? Michael Gambon was way over the top, he plays Dumbledore like he hasn't read the books. Where was Winky and Dobby? What happened at the end with not revealing all the Deatheaters, like Crabbe and Goyle? These are just a few of the things left out that irked me. The last hour of the movie felt like a bunch of false endings, it didn't flow well at all. Honestly, I felt like this one was just churned out to make a buck. I hope this isn't indicative of how the rest are going to be done.",0
908,4.0,"So I decided to rewatch the series and for some reason, I didn't remember this one being so bad. But it is. Everything feels rushed and emotionless. This film would have benefited from having two parts. Emma Watson was clearly poorly directed because instead of getting better as an actor, she got worse in this one. Ron is reduced to a silly comic relief, the outsiders, like Fleur and Krum, are just there, barely have any developments and you couldn't care less about them. The bad acting when CD died was painfully long to watch, the most believable was CD playing dead. Dumbledore has some obvious anger management issues. The quiddich world cup part was so lame, if they were going to do it like that, they could have left it out and explained it through a conversation. Snape forcing Harry and Ron to look at their books, for exemple, was really juvenile and a scene wasted. Could have focused more on Ron and Hermione, his reaction, something, because if I hadn't read the books, I would not understand that he was jealous, since their interaction in this movie basically doesn't exist. They are almost acquaintances. Tons of scenes make no sense, like Cho acting like she really likes Harry but five minutes later she is the most important thing for Diggory? Wut? Hermione to Krum? They barely spoke, there was no evidence of their relationship other than a commentary ""That's why you spend so much time in the library"". Seriously, bad script, bad direction, bad acting... too bad they can't redo it.",0
909,7.0,"At first blush the movie comes across well; but by the end you are left feeling you watched a highlight reel. Others I have spoken with mentioned getting restless in the last 45 minutes; which they hadn't done in the previous movies. The movie has great special effects, is sufficiently dark to equate to the book; but simply does not maintain a well-edited flow of a story. Granted, the movie needed to cut a good portion of the book to fit into the time constraints. Sadly, the choice of scenes and script did a mediocre choice of what to put on film.",0

I've seen them all now and I have to say that the Goblet of Fire is definitely the best film out of all of them thus far, by far!!! Because the book is so long, the filmmakers obviously needed to leave some things out (Dobby and Winky for instance) However, the changes they made worked great with the story! The film was exciting, dramatic, and incredibly emotional. The adult actors are spectaculor, the children still need a little work, but they are getting better with age. The Yule ball is unforgettable and the Triwizard Tasks leave you dreaming that you too could get through Platform 9 3/4 hop on the Hogwarts Express enter your name in the Goblet of Fire and have the chance of eternal glory! The wait was worth it-the movie is absolutely spectacular",0

914,9.0,Just seen the film & thought i had to write a short comment about it,1
915,8.0,"When I went into the cinema to watch ""Goblet"" I was a bit scared. Everything they wrote in the German newspapers was not at all positive. And I couldn't really imagine Mike Newell directing a Potter-movie. But from the first seconds of the film to the last letter of the credits it was just unbelievably breath-taking. Newell created a completely new Harry Potter. The first two movies were very typical fantasy-adventures. The third one was just dark and sad. But ""Goblet"" is a perfect mixture of humour, teenage-conflicts, but also action and thrilling scenes. I was also delighted to see that the acting-skills of the trio improved dramatically. They took the step from child to adult. Same did the entire movie. ""Goblet"" is no fairy tale any more and deserves the rating PG13. The last thing that remains is the soundtrack. I was shocked at first when I heard, that John Williams wouldn't write this one. But once again I was positively surprised. The important themes of the previous 3 films remained, but there are many new elements. And they are just.... good! The only negative fact to mention is that some scenes are rather short. That's why I rate this film with 9.5 out of 10 points. I am delighted to say that a Potter-film finally reached the level of the books!",1
916,,"This is a most favorite film of Harry Potter series for me. Although it is long, it does drag on. it has a nice, tight feel to it. ",1
917,10.0,"this movie was way better than all of the other ones. and for those of you loyal enough to know that the third movie was the next thing up from rubbish will be happy to know that this one knows how to be loyal to the book and still be different. it's just right, I knew Mike Newell would do it!! there wasn't anything that I could say ""they should have done this"" to. I love the content of the film, the acting in the film and the directing of the film. I would go back and see it a thousand times. people were cheering with joy after the movie was finished. this movie touched every emotion, as it should have. I left the movie theater and started screaming because it left me feeling so satisfied. there are parts that are a bit scary, but overall I give this movie the highest rating and my props to Mike Newell.",0
918,5.0,"My son and I had been looking forward to seeing the newest Harry Potter film, but right from the beginning I began wondering if I was in the right theater. We were looking forward to seeing the Dursleys reaction to the Weasleys showing up in their fireplace and Dudley eating the ton-tongue coffee: gone. Harry's excitement regarding the World Cup: gone. Crouch Jr in Harry's dream, what was that? Albus Dumbledore would have never yelled or pushed Harry about, not would he have sat himself down on the steps nervous and fretful, he appeared feeble minded. I must say at this point of the movie, I was ready to go home. I was disappointed not to see Sirius Black, and I don't mean the few raise embers in a fireplace. (Not convincing)",0
919,6.0,"I am an avid Harry Potter fan, but I have to say that this movie did even come close to the book. I think it was in part due to bad directing. The beginning scenes zoom by and goes straight into the action. Anyways, this movie tries to stay very true to the book. Tries. Most of the important things and a few details are all in there, but it seems as though the director was racing to cram as much as he could into the movie, instead of focusing on giving it a sensible storyline. Each scene was given only cursory attention, even if they were extremely important. For example, lets take the Quidditch World Cup. We don't know where they're going until they actually arrive, and even then the name is only mentioned once. There is no quidditch action, it goes straight from introducing the team to showing the kids in their tent after the game. Even I was thrown off balance for a bit. Then, all of a sudden, there are these black KKK guys.",0
920,5.0,Loved the first 3 HP movies. Enjoyed them 100% This one was just OK. It could have been much better. My biggest problem is technical editing and transitions.,1
921,7.0,"I felt quite a bit disappointed after seeing this movie and spent the whole car ride home arguing with my husband about the quality of the film. If you are looking for a lot of great special effects then this is the movie for you, if you actually read the books and are looking for the film to replicated the feel of the book then you will most likely be disappointed. It seemed to me that the director was to caught up with making the audience go ooh and ahhhh over the effects that he forgot about the story. I did like that Warner Bros. didn't try and P.G. rate this film because then it would have just been awful. Little Harry is not so little anymore and I was shocked at the number of children under age 6 in the theater, most of whom were completely uninterested or scared by the film. As a fan of the books first and the movies second, I must say that this has been the biggest Potter disappointment to date. I just hope that Warner Bros. finds a better director for the next film that will actually work in some type of underlying story to go with the special effects.",0
922,10.0,"Just when you think this series is all about magic, you get hit by an emotional carpet bomb, making you think you were watching a heartbreaking, yet inspirational drama. The acting continues to get better as we watch our 3 kids grow up and especially Harry, he might have aged 10 years in this movie. CGI continues to get better while still some questionable decisions though. This is where the plot thickens and gets you ready for what's to come, but don't be afraid if you shed a tear or two in the final moments of this amazing film.",1
923,8.0,"This movie was extremely well put together and few movies have displayed the quality that I have seen in this one. The movie keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat from beginning to end. Especially if you haven't read the book before. The only flaws I found in this movie were that it was too short, leaving out a lot of scenes I would have liked to see from the book, and that Hermione appeared to be on an emotional roller coaster, at times displaying acting brilliance and at times taking it over the top. The other problem I see is that sometimes the director made Harry seem sort of weak. In the dragon scene, Harry had almost no problem taking the egg from the dragon, but in the movie there was a great deal of struggle for him. Although I understand that this is just good action, I would like to see Harry get more credit for his power, he is the one who is Voldemort's nemesis. Especially in the graveyard scene, where they didn't show him resisting the Imperius curse, and when harry was escaping he was taking down Death Eaters in the book as he ran, but in the movie he just fled, and the Death Eaters didn't depict as much fear of Harry Potter as I had interpreted from the book. However, albeit its flaws the strengths overcome them and make this movie the BEST movie I've seen in my entire life. The action was outstanding, the storyline was true, and there were no large alterations from it. I loved the Ule Ball and all of the events from the Triwizard Cup. The raging hormones of the teenagers was hilarious, and contributed to a large portion of the humor from the film, if not all the humor. At this point, I would give the movie and 8.5/10, but what brought the movie to a 10/10 for me was LORD VOLDEMORT. He was amazing, every bit as evil as I had expected and every bit as powerful. He was probably the best part of the movie for me, and the reason that I was so excited to see it. This movie was outstanding, very well directed and an edge of your seat action/comedy/drama/mystery movie, the likes of which I have never seen before.",1
924,10.0,"In this movie, we see the Wizards world is an international one, with students from France, Bulgaria Ireland, so it stretches far beyond Hogwarts. It is also the movie that introduces Robert Pattinson, now a well known British actor from his Twilight series, then an emerging acting star. It still features the all famous, brilliant actor of the British cinema, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. The story grows a bit darker, it introduces some teen in love plots, as such keeps in pace with its audiences, that has grown, and wants a book and a movie that responds to their life, and I think this movie and book does come to this exact desire.",1
925,8.0,"This is the first Harry Potter movie to be directed by a British director. Mike Newell takes the helm , and produces a visual feast of wonderous special effects, and drama. The first three movies, have all been fantastic, and faithfully followed the story, almost to the word. Upon watching ""Goblet of Fire"", I actually found myself being disappointed. From the first scene, there are subtle changes made to the story, so they can keep the film at a reasonable run time. In fairness, the book is almost three times as long as previous ones, so the film could have made the 4 hour mark, however, for those of you that have read the book, will find these ""changes"" quite annoying. It ruined, unfortunately, my enjoyment of the film. But if we gloss over that, and focus on the good points.",0
926,4.0,I went to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire this morning and was very disappointed. What there was of the book that made it into the book was excellent. The movie bears very little resemblance to the book. The 3 tri-wizard tasks were featured to the exclusion of almost all else. The house elf line in the story was left out altogether. There is a brief scene or two at the world quidditch championship but for the most part the early chapters are pretty much ignored. This movie would have been much better had it been 4 hours and included most of the important stuff from the book rather than leave it out and making the movie a hollow shell of the book. Save your movie watch it on DVD.,0
927,,"In general, this movie was better than the others. The tasks were amazing to watch. The Yule Ball was done nicely. I'm upset by the lack of Dursley's, and the non-existent Quidditch World Cup, but I understand that certain things needed to be cut.",1
928,7.0,"First off, I really like the Harry Potter books, and I have enjoyed the first TWO movies (except for the relationships). I especially enjoyed the fourth book in the series, the Goblet of Fire. This review was made based on my viewing of the Goblet of Fire: Sounds/Voice Acting: 8 I enjoyed the sounds but the voice acting was somewhat...hilarious as more and more is being discovered. I noticed some spelling errors on the scriptwriters behalf, my most favorite being prof. Mcgonagall(sp?) about how the Yule Ball being on Christmas eve ""NIGHT"". Now that was pretty enjoyable. At times I could barely understand whats going on from the quiet voices and at others so loud...The only thing that made up for this was the main voice acting performance, in a class of their own.",1
929,6.0,"This time i was surprised with the result that WB gave me. And again, i say that i don't care how much was cut out of the original book. I am taking this as a film, not as an adaptation. Yes, this one definitely is darker and more adult, bet are they going to say that before every HP movie? Of course, but with time it will stop working, and HP will be making barely 300 000 000 dollars, because this film was already PG-13, which is pretty silly, because HP is already a kids classic, and now it is stolen by an attempt to attract more people to the theaters. I would call that a brutal attempt to make extra $$$. But, dammit, it works! Now, i will tell you why this film could disappointing for those, who also take this as a film - first of all, the acting. It's not really terrible, but it's not convincing. And how D. Radkliff got to one of the top spots of the IMDb ""Best And Worst Polls of 2005"" as best actor, is beyond my understanding. It is just impossible for 16 year old to play a 14 year old! YOU CANNOT FAKE PUBIRTY!!! Radkliff should have understood it. The same goes to the other actors. And now we come to the special effects. Same old, same old, one year CGI, which will seem really crappy after a few years or so. And again, this is just an entertainment movie, that definitely overrated and taken far too seriously.",0
930,7.0,"Let me first start out with a confession: I am a 47 year old Potterhead, who has read all of the published the books way too many times. My four kids, ages 11 thru 18, come to me for answers to their Potter trivia. I'm just this side of obsessive.",0
931,6.0,"I loved the previous films and even more I loved Joanne K. Rowlings marvelous, funny, witty novels... I thus had great expectations when I went to see this movie and was to some extend disappointed. The book being the best of all Harry-Potter novels and all the good reviews made me even more interested...",1
932,9.0,"I don't know what to say about this film, I love it very much, the story is super compelling, completely different from the ones of the other films in the saga. I really liked the fact that there were the three schools competing with each other, or I found the challenges of the race very entertaining, also for the mystery that each one has. The opening scenes of the quidditch cup were done beautifully, the overall special effects of the film are amazing (I really liked how the dragons were made). This film is also the crux of the ""relationship"" between harry and voldemort, the point where things really start to get complicated and aggravated. Obviously I recommend this film (and in general the whole saga) to everyone, in particular for this reason it is important to know that the story and the narrative are valued more rather than the action and the logical and mysterious connections.",1
933,10.0,"My favorite scene in the movie is when Snape (Alan Rickman) Wacks, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) several times over their heads. Another scene that I liked in the movie is when 'Mad Eye' (Brendan Gleeson) changes Malfoy (Tom Felton) into a ferret. I will always remember that scene as ""Draco The Amazing, Bouncing, Ferret."" I think if they had Julie Walters as Molly Weasley in this movie it would have been jut a tad bit better. They missed an important points in this movie, like for example, Harry giving his money to the Twins for their joke business or Sirius being at Hogwarts after the 3rd task. Am I the only person here that realized that they used a different actress for Angelina Johnson?. They messed up where Fred (James Phelps) Asked Angelina (Tiana Benjamin) out to the Yule Ball. In the the book he asked her out right in the middle of the Gryffindor common room, In the movie he asked her to the Yule Ball in the Great Hall. The Phelps Twins do an amazing performance as the Weasley Twins in this movie portraying them just as I imagined in the book. I rally like the scene when McGonagall (Maggie Smith) teaches everyone how to dance. You have to see the movie to get what I liked about the movie. Angelica Mandy does a perfect Gabrielle Delacour, just as I imagined.",1
934,9.0,The fourth installment in the Harry Potter series sent me on a thrill ride of emotions. The director did a wonderful job of balancing the humor amidst the horror of the events that took place in the film. It left me anxiously awaiting the next film too come.,1
935,9.0,"Being a bit of a potter fan i was kind of waiting for this with baited breath. One reason for this being the tri wizard cup, wanting to see it transfered from page to screen is a must see. Another reason being that the third, the prisoner of azkerban was my favourite book in the series but a bit of a disappointment as a film. This film does not. It excites everyone, from child to adult. If I had any negative comments it would be that the film does miss a lot out of the book but what do you expect seeing the book has about 700 pages. Also rupert grint is still up to his over the top face poses, but hey never mind. Mike newell does an excellent job at directing this, dark chapter in the series. And when i mean dark, i mean dark, this is far to scary a film for youngsters and even has a certain sexual chemistry building between its characters as their obviously going through puberty. The effects are brilliant and the acting is great, but even though Gambon is flawless in is version of dumbledore, I can't help but miss Richard Harris.This is the best of the film series so far and I feel that it will be better than the next as nothing much happens in the order of the phoenix until the last chapter. Bring on the rest though, as potter is most likely the greatest magical adventure series of our lifetime",1
936,6.0,"Many reviewers and message board users have mentioned that this movie was disappointing to avid fans of the books, and the defendants claim that the book had to be cut and we fans shouldn't expect for every little subplot to be mentioned. I felt, however, that the movie was disappointing *not* for what it left out, but for what it put into the film.",0
937,8.0,"Considering that the director had to remove a huge chunk of the back story in the book in order to fit all the important elements into the film, this film works surprisingly well. Some of the deletions, for example, the long-winded story of the missing witch, are probably an improvement, while others, such as scenes with Dobby and SPEW, are understandably not included. The story of Crouch and his son is greatly truncated but nevertheless well-done - particularly the scene where Barty Crouch suddenly realised who Moody actually is.",1
938,7.0,"I write this shortly after The Order of the Phoenix came out on DVD, so I'm going to dispense with commenting too much on the film itself because chances are most people already know what they think as far as this film goes.",0
939,9.0,"It's just not possible folks to put the WHOLE book into ONE film, so lay off the gripes about what was cut etc. This is great - the essential elements are all there, unlike POA which left out a VITAL element, i.e. the identities of Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail and Prongs (although interestingly Pettigrew is happily referred to as ""Wormtail"" in this film). The film is really dark, and scary, and moved us to tears at the end. What more could we hope for? Voldemort is the stuff of nightmares - I'm glad my kids aren't small any more, we would have taken them and regretted it. As it was, we all enjoyed it A LOT and recommend it to Potter fans and non-fans alike. I want to see it again soon.",1
940,10.0,Omg!!This was the best one yet.,1
941,9.0,Only because I have seen the Fifth movie. I loved the Goblet of Fire in it's paper backed form. And I loved what they did with the movie adaptation.,1
942,5.0,"The movie was a disappointment. I understand that the book is far too long to incorporate into a movie but, I hoped that what little they picked out from the book they could have tried getting it right. The headmaster Dumbledore was completely out of character behaving more like a angry old man rather than a calm and wise old wizard. Voldermort turned out to be a joke with his rock singer like antics. They got the 'slit-like' noses, and the 'high pitched' voice though. But he looked anything like the most evil wizard of all. Who picked these guys to act anyway? As for the plot, there were some agonizing moments in the movie such as the quidditch games which started, and then never ended. Sort of a clear message to the viewers saying: ""Sorry folks we've got to finish up this movie and we can't put in everything. Moving on to other things in brief...."". Well I'm sorry, but the show length was 157 mins long. That's still less than 3 hours, and if you include a scene at LEAST complete it. Pretty bad work Mr. Director.",0
943,7.0,"Well overall the movie was good with a good mix of teenage problems, scary stuff and humour (Hagrid's love life springs to mind!!) But on the other hand i won't be taking my 8 year old to see the movie firstly because i think the scenes with Voldemort are too scary and there's too much swearing for my liking. I know Ron swears in all the movies but there was more in this and i know it's a 12A but all the same she's pretty grown up for her age.",1
944,8.0,This is definitely the best movie out of the series. This installment has more emotions and a good story. I'm not sure that the future movies can live up to this installment.,1
945,10.0,"I think the story and design of the Goblet of fire is the best in the Harry Potter series. Harry is designed to participate in the Goblet of fire competition, go through difficulties and dangers, and finally witness the resurrection of Voldemort. It's also the key to open the dark plot behind.",1
946,1.0,"What the heck were the producers and director thinking? This move was the equivalent of a bad haircut- choppy, incomplete, and completely unprofessional. I love the book series Harry Potter, but this movie doesn't even come close to the others(yes even the first two cheeky ones.) For example, It skipped over really important things like the house elves, Winky at the world cup, and S.P.E.W. The only 2% worth watching is the graveyard scene. Ralph Finnes is excellent as Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore is portrayed in this movie as an arrogant, angry, bitter old man, who yells at Harry and doesn't believe him. While the cheeky three(Harry,Ron, and Hermione)have improved as actors, but all the actors direction is bad. I would NOT see this movie unless you are a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, but other than that don't see this.",0
947,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire are both the most wonderful works, no matter how wonderful the plot is or how colorful the characters are. The movie also shows that Harry's wonderful adventure is coming to an end. With the resurrection of Voldemort, he must quickly grow into a fighter warrior.",1
948,8.0,"After the brilliantly dark Prisoner of Azkaban directed by Alfonso Cuaron, my expectations for the fourth Harry Potter movie Goblet of Fire were very high. All directors bring in to the soup their own spices, and I was excited to see Mike Newell's (director of ""Four weddings and a Funeral"") handiwork with the world's most famous boy wizard. And my high expectations were pretty much met.",0
949,8.0,"I loved the movie! I know somethings were left out or changed, but it was great! ",1
950,,"As usual they've produced yet another fantastic HP Sauce (as I like to call it) movie. However I felt this one did not live up to the standards of the other films, or the book. It wasn't bad but it could've been better. ",0
951,5.0,"I was very excited about this movie and very interested to see how they were going to fit 700 pages of novel into 2-3 hrs on the big screen. Well, now I know... they take a little bit from each chapter, flash 10 min of it on the screen..then go on to the next ""random"" scene. I found my self getting very frustrating to know how important the scene was and what was about to happen, just to be whisked away to another point in time. The actors did a good job though it seemed that Dumbledore was very different from the book. This time around they took many liberties in straying from the original storyline. It is definitely made for people who read the book, people who didn't were getting lost at certain points in the movie. I almost think they should have made it a 2 parter. It had so much potential but was very disappointing.",0
952,4.0,"The plot is as good as in the other movies, since it is based on the book. However, I wonder what was the director thinking? Several important facts of the book are missing, while other scened that are only briefly or not mentioned at all in the book are played. The movies seems to be made of several short scenes, that for someone that never read the book do not make any sense at all. It is understandable that lots of cuts had to be made to fit such a large book in only one movie... but they could at least have tried to create a movie in which there was a clear connection between the scenes and accessible for everyone(not only to those that read the book). In conclusion: very disappointing and illogical!",0
953,7.0,"There have been some films that have done the books justice. Top of my head, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption were turned into great films. And while Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire isn't a complete waste of a movie, as an avid fan of the books, I have to say I was disappointed.",0
954,8.0,"The movie: I would rate it as Good instead of Excellent. I would rate POA excellent! After Alfonso's direction, Mike's direction was back to Chris' structure. The movie was NOT boring...no, not at all... but the book has been chopped away! There is NO quidditch at all - that is played - just the players making an entry. There is no Madness of Mr Crouch, no WINKY! The other champions' games have been snatched away - and Fleur has been made to look quite silly!! She becomes a weeping, hysterical woman in the Maze. I wonder why they did that to her character... (This is all a hotchpotch of my thoughts so bear with me - after 10 hours of being in a theatre it sort of makes me run rampant!) Ah, so where was I?",0

956,3.0,"I suppose making a film strictly for the 12-14 crowd is fine, but then how can you justify including such disturbing imagery? An adult certainly won't enjoy it; there's no plot as such, and anyone with an attention span of more than a few minutes will be dreadfully disappointed.",0
957,10.0,I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it.

959,8.0,"The fourth installment of the Harry Potter books / movies proves to be the darkest yet. With a growing cast of characters (this time, Ralph Feinnes joins as the rejuvenated Lord Voldemort), the HP series continues its momentum and in a big way! With the 3rd director of the movie series, Mike Newell (after Christopher Columbus for the first two and Alfonso Cuaron for the third), putting more serious tones at the appropriate times and injecting humor in the unique (though sometimes unnecessary ways, like HP's scene with Moaning Myrtle), he stays true to the spirit of the Goblet of Fire book.",1
960,10.0,"This is the first out of four Harry Potter films that are PG-13. Yeah, we don't know the rating of the 8th and last one yet, but it's obvious it will be PG-13. Anyway, the 4th Harry Potter film is a good movie. It gives us new charters, and a competition! You'll see it when you watch the movie. But this movie does have good humor, action, terror, etc. This movie has a PG-13 rating, and it does deserve it. It has I believe 6 swear words which may make your young ones uncomfortable. The last fight scene I think is the scariest and your little ones may be traumatized by Voldemort's new look and The Death Eaters. It will scare them seeing some one die, (this is the first Harry Potter film were someone dies) and seeing one of The Death Eaters cut his hand off and cut Harry Potter which does show a lot of blood, will most likely scare your young ones. I would recommend this film to children 10 and older. Younger ones may be able to handle it, but most definitely not 6 and younger. I have a 6 year old, and this movie gave him nightmares. But, I do think this is a good movie with lots of good fun. This film does end pretty much Part 1 of Harry Potter. I take the Harry Potter series as a two parter. The first four films Part 1 and the last four films Part 2. The end of this movie is the beginning of some of the darker Harry Potter films that little ones will find scary. SO, you have watched 4 out of 8 Harry Potter films. The first half. Now get ready for the epic climax that is the last 4 films! Now go out and get the 5th one!",1
961,10.0,"This film eliminates a major flaw of the previous films. The narrative shouldn't be a tool to tell the Wizarding World, the Wizarding World should be there as a tool to tell the narrative of the CURRENT entry. This entry has its own, self-contained storyline; its own unique concepts are explored rather than further exploration of the bigger picture. The problem with some film series is the first film is the beginning, the next film is the middle, and the last film is the end to one story rather than being three stories with their own beginnings, middles, and ends.

I'm going to have a great time anyway, but it's not going to be just the same as the book."" ",1

It's all well and good to say that the filmmakers had to cut out a lot to shorten it, but the film suffered in many ways. The opening scenes whirl by in minutes and Ron and Hermoine are left out in the cold a little bit. This was a movie I recommend seeing but here are a few potential ruins for loyal Potter fans. 1. Ron and Hermione are secondary characters.",1
965,9.0,"Do books ruin movies, or do movies ruin books? If you can get past the vast amount of material that didn't make the cut for Goblet of Fire, then the answer will hopefully be neither. If not, then I sure hope for your sake that the Narnia movie stays true to Lewis. Being an old Tolkien hand myself, I am able to appreciate just what a good job the writers did compacting a truly enormous book without losing the important points. Were there no faults? Au contraire, Fleur. Characters were not nearly as developed, scenes lacked some of the humor, impact or exposition that a novel allows. Some key points in the book were changed since the explanations were too lengthy to even consider. It was still far better in that sense than Prisoner of Azkaban, where I felt anyone who hadn't read the book must have been tearing their hair out (which raises the question, do people who don't read HP books see HP movies?). I can definitely say that this is the best Potter movie so far, at least in my opinion. I will always prefer the books, but that is me and I don't presume for a minute that everyone agrees with me. My wife was very disappointed, even though she really enjoyed the movie, and said that ""it was like watching a slide show of the book"". Fairly accurate description. So do books ruin movies or do movies ruin books? Is the glass half empty or half full? Why ask why? Just enjoy the drink and when it is empty, pour yourself another.",1
966,1.0,"Each of the first three movie got better till this one hit the fan. NO Dobby, NO Ludo Bagman NO Winky, no Dursleys, NO Veela, NO Leprechauns, NO world cup match matches, NO Mrs Crouch, NO Malfoy-Potter conflict, No Spew, NO directing-Mike Newell is a hack made obvious by NO acting-Harry has only 3 facial expressions and Ron has 2, but Dumbledore was the worst, Harry is as white as Michael Jackson. The script (by Steve Kloves) was so poor there is no evidence he read more than the Cliff Notes. The students for the other schools looking like idiots (a boring girls Synchronized swimming team and I goofy bunch of boy scouts with sticks to make tiny sparks with) so very sad! The Casting Team had to be both blind and deaf because their choices nearly leave me mute. The special effects (especially the Dragons) are good but is the only saving grace to this rotten film.",0
967,8.0,"I love this movie so much but it definitely has issues. it leaves out so so so much from the book, some of the best parts. it also feels way too rushed and there's hardly any character development for the golden trio. the quidditch world cup is built up so much and then we don't even get to see it. the second and third tasks in the triwizard tournament are done well, but the first task doesn't make any sense...it got way out of hand which didn't happen in the book, and hogwarts would have never allowed it in the first place.",1
968,10.0,"This movie was great. I walked out of the theatre and was nearly willing to walk back in and see it again had it not been 10pm. The acting in this movie felt top-notch to me. I feel that Dan, Rupert, and Emma have all immensely improved in their acting abilities, giving a much more natural feel to the performance. And of course, the supporting cast was excellent as always, especially Miranda Richardson (Rita Skeeter) and, as always, Alan Rickman (Snape). Now, before I lay out my complaints with this movie, let me start by saying that I am an immense fan of the books and have read each one numerous times. I am all for having a five hour movie that further encompasses more of the book, yet I have come to expect the reality that such a treat will most likely never come (Although an extended edition, like in the Lord of the Rings series would be great). My main gripe has to do with the time of the movie. Yes, two and a half hours is a long running time, however, for this movie, an extra half hour would have been plenty to overall round out this film. In several scenes, it was noticeable that the actors had rushed their dialogue. Classroom scenes and various non-plot related scenes, the ones that give the books their flare, were missing. And finally, a major part of the book, at least in my mind, was the Quidditch World Cup, yet, where was it, if somewhere besides that short clip of nothing happening. The least they could have done is a five minute scene of highlights of it. Besides these gripes, minor compared to the remainder of the film, I would whole-heartedly recommend seeing this film. Now you'll have to excuse me, for I am leaving to go watch it again.",0

970,6.0,"Hey Guys.. I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. HP Books that is.. and not the movies so much. This movie was good from a movie-for-non-hp-reader standpoint. But from a perspective of someone like myself who's read all the books 10 times, a lot of things just do not make sense.",0

972,,"I saw Harry Potter around early December when normally I would've seen it on opening day or weekend and the first half of the movie I thought it was okay but now that I look back on the overall film I thought it was good. The book was amazing so the movie should've been to. After the third HP greatly disappointed me (I still liked it but it could've been SO much better)this really made me get excited for the rest of the movies. Why did everyone make a big deal over the visual effects? They were nothing compared to Star Wars 3 or even War of the Worlds. They certainly weren't worthy of being nominated at the Oscars. Although I can't imagine how War of the Worlds was and Star Wars wasn't. Anyway it was a great Harry Potter film with some decent acting here and there from Brendan Gleeson (shouldn't have played Mad-Eye Moody), Alan Rickman (has a much more brief series of appearances in this one), and even Daniel Radcliffe. An excellent film. I think I'll buy it. It's worth it but rent it first because you never know you may hate it. Overall this film has it all. Romance, a journey that seems to never end, the test of a friendship and much much more!",1
973,7.0,"I give the movie seven stars. It did what it was supposed to do, and it did it well. The third movie was spectacular AS A MOVIE, but this was simply a well done adaptation.",0
974,3.0,true harry potter fans will NOT like it!!,1
975,10.0,"Spoilers? This film is lacking much from the book--it left the Dursleys completely out. It only shows the death of Frank Bryce in at least three minutes, and the dream of this is bothering Harry. Right after that, it cuts to Harry in bed, being awoken by Hermione to go to the Quidditch World Cup, Ron invited him. They cut the game quite short, but you at least get to see Victor Krum, an amazing player. But the camp is distrupted by Death Eaters, Vodomorts followers, so they have to get to school soon after the attack. But at least it has everything for the Tasks. When Harry Potter enters his fourth year, two other schools compete in the Triwizard Tournament, three difficult tasks, one student from each school in it. But, someone put his name in the cup of people entering, even though he was an under-age wizard. Now he has to compete in the three deadly tasks, with only his friends for hope.",1
976,2.0,"Having been so thoroughly let down by the previous three movies, I waited a long time to see this one. Not for its big-screen release, not for the dollar theater, not even for the DVD release... I waited until I could borrow it from the local library. I didn't miss anything.",1
977,8.0,"I can't wait to get back into this magical world. As for what ""Harry Potter"" is, I should not introduce it again! Is that ok? ! Although speaking by common sense, again strong IP also has the user that cannot cover.",1
978,7.0,"I might be more enthusiastic about this movie if I had not seen the previous ones first. Indeed it might have come across as the best yet if viewed in isolation. However, the fact is that most people watching this movie have already seen its predecessors. The cinematic magic of Hogwarts has been extensively explored by three other movies, so another long sequence of Harry flying around the castle pursued by a dragon quickly palls. Also, as a previous reviewer noted, the movie skips over some areas so fast that you need to have read the book to know what is going on (the romance between Krum and Hermione, for example) while lingering over special effects that add little to the story.",0
979,7.0,"'Goblet of Fire' isn't my favourite of the Harry Potter books, but I've been eagerly awaiting the big screen version of the book like every other Potter fan. I saw the movie last weekend at a preview screening and I really enjoyed it.",1
980,6.0,Spoiler alert This is probably the worst to date of the adaptations. Though visually astounding I mean did they had to devote almost 15 minutes to the ball when in the book was briefly described I mean even the after party. The movie loses the feeling of the book The other 3 champions were the best of the best of their respective schools truth be told the only reason Harry passed most of the tests was because Voldemort wanted to take him out of Hogwarts and fake Moody was helping him in the book he clearly reflect that he had to be out of his mind to compete against older already OWL certified wizard. In the picture the other champions as depicted as fools almost as clueless as Harry. The scene at the labyrinth seemed kind of plain when in the book he was casting spells against creatures to defend and continue.,0
981,2.0,"Although the HP series is quite entertaining, this movie is an exception. It has no plot. All the time I knew what will happen next, exactly and precisely, this movie is exceptionally predictable.",1
982,7.0,"I just seen this movie at a matinée performance, and I did like it, but a fair warning, there is a great deal of plot holes. The beginning starts with the dream from the beginning of the book, then, whoosh!, right to leaving for the world cup, at the world cup, WHOOSH, the death eaters tearing apart the camp, Whoosh again, to hogwarts and the tournament. After all that, it smooths out. It has great character build, but it could've been better. Great animatronics, and great CG animation. Acting could've been better, and some scenes were wishy washy, but it did rather well for the movie it was. Quite comical when the Mad eye Moody turned Draco into a ferret. Yule Ball was good, and the great hall kinda looked like that ice hotel from Die Another Day. 7/10.",1
983,10.0,"Never have I experienced a book translate to silver screen where it was ""Deja Vu"" It was just as I imagined when reading the book. Must keep the current production staff...OUTSTANDING JOB!!! and I was quite happy to see the relationship of the kids back on screen, Prizoner of Azkaban slaughtered the bond between the main characters, but it is back with The Goblet...Thank you! The special effects are outstanding, the actors have really grown into there respective characters. I will be going again this week on request by my 4 year old son, who also loved it.. He is a huge fan, and has been since he was freshly 2. I personally don't think it is dark, as the news is reporting, and find it acceptable for any HP fan, Adam fully understood what was going on. I highly recommend this film for anyone with an imagination. However if you are taking a young one, you may want to give them a heads up on what to expect, just so they won't be in your ear constantly. 10 Stars for this one..Can't wait for The Order to come out now..",1
984,8.0,"This was fantastic compared to the first three Harry Potter movies. Those I just hated (especially the third one; Cuaron did a terrible job), but this was amazing.",1
985,10.0,"My son has grown up with the books, and I've always brought him on opening night to each of the first three movies (which we also have in our DVD collection.) He just turned fourteen in October which was apropos for the release of this movie. Of course again, having been enchanted by the first three films, (expecially the last Cuaron sequel,) I again brought him to opening night. Wow, being 48 and a big lover of the LOTR movies, I was absolutely enthralled! All of the characters were so much more fleshed out. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have grown so much as actors as well as just, well grown! I think that's why so many more adults can access this film on a more common ground. Sometimes we forget what it was like to be a kid, but we never forget puberty. NEVER!!! ",1
986,,"like everyone else of my generation I was a huge fan of the books, but as they fade from my memory it's easier to enjoy the films on their merits alone. I'll say this for the harry potter series: they're entertaining. of course, so were the books; jk rowling's success is all the more extraordinary when one considers what a thing of the past reading has become; even in the 90s I remember the majority of my friends being more interested in the Disney channel.",1
987,9.0,As of last night I have seen Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire twice! I have to say that I was a little scared to see this film because of the fact that they (the screenwriters) had to cut down an enormous book into a very short script. Well they did it. The movie is absolutely amazing! Steven Kloves did such a great job adapting the book to the film. As of now the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Potter film released: the acting was very well done by the main trio and as well as the adult cast (Snape was particularly humorous) and the way the Mike Newell brought his experiences to the movie was amazing. It is certainly a lot darker in this film and I loved it. All in all a must see by any fan of the book!,1
988,1.0,"I love this series, but this movie confused me. I was really disappointed. Perhaps the world created in the previous movies was not to Mike Newell's (the director) liking, but entirely changing the world (except for the ricketty bridge) in this movie really detracted from the flow and interest. This change was the first of many that seemed unnecessary in this film, both from the previous movies and from the books. While the dragon scene was exhilarating, there was almost no connection in that scene to the book, which I thought was a better story. Also, the Clock tower, which was forefront in the previous movie, was changed--WHY? This movie was also very choppy, I understand it's a long book, and therefore difficult to compress into a movie, but I have been told by those who haven't read the books that they couldn't follow it at all. Would it have been that bad to add an extra half hour if it would have made it smoother? Come on here, the movie and books have almost a cult following. On the other hand, I was impressed by the use of facial expressions to portray the emotions which could not easily be displayed in a movie, but beyond that, the movie was horrible.",0
989,9.0,"The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous instalments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvellous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.",0
990,10.0,"Those that read the book would understand how good the movie was. But, I have to say that Dumbledore doesn't have the charm he's supposed to have. I hate the guy playing Dumbledore. It's not that the actor did not do a good job, it's just he doesn't quite fut into the character. He doesn't have the serenity the kindness in his eyes as Dumbledore should have had. The first person to play the role of Dumbledore was perfect, but unfortunately he's not among us anymore. I feel that the person who played Gandalf(Ian McKellen) in LOTR would fit much better for the position of Dumbledore. But, overall the movie was excellent. The cast did an excellent job. I recommend everyone to go see it.",1
991,7.0,"I was kind of scared this wouldn't be as good because the time limit, but I was Impressed from a new director, like in Harry Potter 3, Alfonso something, didn't do that great. But when seeing this, I couldn't wait to see the fifth movie.",1
992,7.0,"Firstly, I don't think it's a horrible movie. It's just that I've come to expect so much more from the Harry Potter movies.",0
993,1.0,"I have always been a huge J. K Rowling fan. Have waited anxiously for the release of this new film! Read lots of review online about the film before hand (Did my homework). As usual, some rated the film A++ and some D. I figure out that it can't be that bad. After all, it has a great story line. It was pissing cats and dog in Britain last Friday. However, i braved the thunderstorm and freezing subzero temperatures to make my way to the cinema. The film was a HUGE, MEGA, GIGA disappointment! I felt like crying after watching it. Mike Newell (the director) killed all the magic there is to the film. It was meant to be a magical story!! A dreamlike story not one full of battles!!!! If i wanted to watch Lord of the Rings, i would go for LODR and not Harry Potter. My guess is that Warner Bros wanted to aim for adult audiences as well as children. hah, who would have guessed that the film was rated 12A instead. It is like turning Cinderella into a night with Paris Hilton! This is not right! All there was, was battles and battles and battles. I would name it Kingdom of Heaven 2. Other than that, when was it even mentioned in the book that Harry and Ron's brides wore SARI to the ball. No offence to the Indian culture, i love ethic clothings but sari and cheongsam in a world of magics seem a bit too far-fetched! Hello, it is not halloween. The prom dance seem more like a world cross-culture ball than a wizard's ball! Michael Gambon who played Albus Dumbledore just must have either not read the book or decided that he was a better author than J. K Rowling. He killed the headmaster of hogward! As far as my memory serve me, I remembered Dumbledore as being cool and calm in all situations. No all panicky with a screw up face most of the time. He was meant to be kind and fatherly. The only actors that played their roles well were Ron Weasley, Harry Porter and Hermione Granger, Professor Snape and Lucius Malfoy. Mike Newell blanked out all the parts that made the book special like sweets that were not just sweets but with spells in them, the ghostly pictures in the halls, the fat lady that guards the door and what happened to the Nicholas the headless ghost? I guess they decided that he was dead and wasn't worth it. By the way, did anyone notice how dark and gloomy the film was most of the time? Makes you think that the producers were going to save of lightings. Well, even with the soaring prices of electricity, i am sure the public would understand if they utilised a little more electricity. Afterall, they made $1.06million on the opening day. I am sure they can afford the utilities bill.",0
994,6.0,"I think the movie was okay. The only things that I was disappointed about was Dumbledore's act wasn't really the character as described in the book. I saw the part where he was shaking Harry when he thought that Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire. I mean I thought Dumbledore was suppose to be wise and calm! This story didn't show that at all. Dumbledore seemed bitter in this movie. Also, I really hated that the movie definitely skipped so many important parts. The movie was lacking many scenes from the book. I understand it's too hard to put that altogether into one movie. But the solution is..that they should have divided it into TWO MOVIES. There were too many IMPORTANT scenes left out. I was excited to see a lot of those scenes and disappointed when they weren't shown.",0
995,4.0,This remains my least favorite translation of Harry Potter to the big screen. The book was basically hacked to pieces and re-written into a stock action-adventure movie. So much of the wonderful detail and substance of the book were abandoned. The original idea to make this into a two-part movie was spot-on. That would be the only way to tell the story effectively.,0
996,10.0,"The newest harry potter came out yesterday. I saw it at a 4:30 showing. All I can say is Wow! I didn't read the book, but I don't think it makes a big difference whether you read it or not. I was funny, scary, jaw dropping and action packed.",1
997,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of the best of the series. I found it pretty entertaining, especially i am in the middle of preparing for final exams. It captured most of the main points of the book. The Triwizard Tournament was accurate, even though some parts were missing. Near the ending the graveyard scene was very detailed, considering it is such important turning point of the Harry Potter series. It was very well done and true to the book.",1
998,1.0,"I can say some with certainty that this movie was as faithful as a married woman in a roadside motel. There were no explanations as to why certain things happen or didn't happen. Other things are left out completely which is understandable given the size of the book, but in this case not really. There were several holes in the storyline. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were as stiff and bland as ever. Plus the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore has proved to be the biggest blunder in the Harry Potter series so far. He's too energetic and he doesn't have any gravitas whatsoever. After GOF, I don't know if I want to see the next one.",1
999,9.0,Very Phony News,0
1000,6.0,Everyone I know that has seen this (7 so far)has been disappointed. Not all have read the book but all share the same disappointment. One of those that saw it with us commented that it seemed like a rush from plot point to plot point like someone was checking off a list.,0
1001,1.0,"Personally, as a movie fanatic and a HP book lover, I am sorely disappointed with all of the HP movies. Casting Daniel Radcliffe as the main character must have been the stupidest thing in the world to do. Mr. Radcliffe can not act, can not cry, can not do much but stand there repeating lines as from a script. I do not know why he was nominated (along with Emma Watson) for a Critics' Choice Award for his part in The Goblet of Fire, but I know one thing for sure, the only reason Harry Potter is even receiving attention is an international phenomena that has gotten too popular for people to notice the many flaws in the entire fandom.",0
1002,6.0,I have been eagerly awaiting this movie as I was so enthralled by the first three movies. I have to say I came away a bit disappointed.,0
1003,7.0,"i thought that this was probably the best movie yet, but there was a lot missing that was/is crucial to the series. **if you have not seen the movie or do not wish to read some spoilers about it, do not read any further.** now, i know that it is hard to condense a 700-something page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie, but still, crucial parts were left out, and it will be interesting to see how they fix it in the next movies. for example: -Dobby and Winky were left out completely, -Ludo Bagman wasn't mentioned at all -barty crouch Jr. was introduced too early, -not enough trials were in the scene with the pensieve, -they never said anything about Rita skeeter being an animagus, -sirius black's role was only a face in the fire, -Albus Dumbledore wasn't the loving, kind headmaster as in the first three, -hermione (emma Watson) was very melodramatic and sounded as if she were going to cry throughout almost the entire movie, -no blast ended skrewts in the maze, -no spider in the maze, -no sphinx and riddle in the maze, and, worst of all i think, -the Quidditch World Cup was not shown! other than this, i thought the movie was exceptionally good. i especially liked the soundtrack. i think Patrick Doyle deserves two thumbs up and a smiley face for such good and fitting music. and the special effects! oh...my...gosh! wow! they were extraordinary! kudos to the special effect people for making this one of the best parts of the movie! i think that the underwater sequence especially was marvelous! the maze itself was good too. i especially liked how the hedges practically ate people when they fell! that was cool. overall, i give this movie 7 out of 10 stars.",1
1004,,"This movie is the forth of the Harry Potter series. This situation is that the Triwizard Tournament is held at the Hogwarts. This tournament is usually three players chosen in each three famous magic schools compete for immortal glory. And, Harry is also chosen as the forth player, because he is picked out by the goblet of fire. So, Harry decides to entry the competition and do his best. He can clear two trials fortunately. He enters into the last trial, and he is transferred to a grave, touching a trophy in the third trial. He meets Voldemort there. Voldemort gets his original power back, so Harry cannot defeat him easily. Harry manages to escape from him. However, Voldemort will chase Harry until killing him. I feel this movie's special effects are so good. And, I want to watch the next.",1
1005,4.0,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was directed by Mike Newell and is the fourth instalment in the Harry Potter franchise. It follows Harry and depicts his struggle with the Triwizard Tournament and the adolescent challenges of his everyday life.",1
1006,7.0,"This was a pretty decent film. Again, a lot of gaps and changes from the book to simplify screen viewing, but I still feel that showing Barty Crouch Jr at the start was unnecessary.",1
1007,8.0,"Given that the atmosphere of the Harry Potter films changed and became darker as the plot went on, after the third film it was clear to me that the fourth film should be even darker, and yes, this is a dark film (dark for Harry Potter standards, that this is Fincher's film of course I would say that it is not dark), but nevertheless to my great sadness it is devoid of all this gothicness that was plentiful in the third part of the film. We have these various events, plot twists, flashbacks, Voldemort's resurrection and oh, no, that boring competition. Well, if it wasn't for so many of the plot, I think the movie would have been considerably better, but then again, this movie is second best Harry Potter movie so far and the third best in the entire franchise.",0
1008,8.0,"Well overall I think that it was rushed I mean personally I think it should have been 3 - 3 1/2 hours instead of 2:37 minutes. anyways I gave it and 8/10 because I thought the special effects were really good, the actors/actresses did a good job acting in most of it (just a few places I thought to be overacted), and because I looked at from more than one point of view which gave a little understanding as to why they left certain parts out. Although I do think that they did leave out a few very important parts and changed a few parts in ways they shouldn't have. But for the sake of not spoiling the movie for others I wont reveal parts that they should not have changed or parts they did.",1
1009,9.0,"This is a brilliant film for all the family,it has a masterpiece of special effects.",1
1010,3.0,"Mike Newell has done a fabulous job in destroying the film.The film is too fast paced and doesn't follows the book on many occasions.Anybody who hasn't read the book will not understand what's going in the movie.Many subplots from the book, which makes the book a great read are missing in the movie.This includes Rita Skeeter plot,Fred and George plot,there is no mention of Bertha Jokins.Also the character of Ludo Bagman is missing from the film.Inshort they have changed the story at many places.",0
1011,6.0,"I guess it's too late to replace Daniel Radcliffe, but from the beginning he was never a compelling on screen presence, and that's a shame. The owlish Harry Potter deserves an edge Ratcliffe simply does not possess. So, every Potter movie including this one seems to have involved spinning some very expensive plates to distract us from this fact. Here are the best special effects money can buy (the Quidditch match is the set piece and is the most satisfying), some rather disconcerting sexual innuendo about Harry's belongings in a bath house, Ralph Fiennes as the evil version of the English Patient (wow, that must have hurt his nose), and the dawning realization that purely through an accident of birth, Harry Potter will prevail over every evil that befalls him. For some reason I find this depressing rather than inspiring. It must go back to my proud American notion that you are not born into greatness, you much create it. Whereas in England, you're stuck for life.",1
1012,7.0,"Emma Watson is lovely but really could have done with an acting coach on this one. Rupert Grint is unexpectedly, to me at least, shaping up to be a fine actor. One can only hope that he can make the transition once the Potter series ends.",1
1013,8.0,"I went to see this over the weekend and I wondered how close it would be to the book, considering it was only a little longer that Sorcerer's Stone. I walked out happy. The special effects were great and real looking. The adult actors were very good, especially Michael Gambon, who I thought he was better in this one than Prisonor of Azkaban. Even though he isn't as good as the great Richard Harris, I thought he did very well. Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe were better in this one than the others, especially Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson really got on my nerves as Hermione in this occasionally. She seemed to act too melodramatic sometimes, but she was all right. As a fan of the books, I think Steve Kloves did better on the screenplay on this one. Even though many things were taken out and it felt a little rushed, everything went in place all right. I'm glad it was rated PG-13 because the story gets a lot darker as it goes on. I thought Voldemort looked pretty cool, except I still can't remember why he was a little half-human midget. Anyway, I wouldn't really recommend this to younger children because of some language, Frightening and violent images. Overall, I think this is the best Harry Potter film yet, and made up for some of the mistakes in Prisoner of Azkaban. I have high hopes for Order of the Phenoix.",1
1014,10.0,"I had pretty high expectations for this movie. I went to see it the day before Thanksgiving with my older sister and younger brother who have pretty much read all the books. I must say, even though it wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be, that didn't stop me from loving the movie. In fact, I loved it so much, sometimes I forgot it was supposed to be scary. The special effects were great. The story was excellent, as were the performances by the actors and actresses. My top 10 favorite characters from this movie were of course Harry, Ron and Hermione, Alistor ""Mad Eye"" Moody, Hagrid, Cedric Diggory, Fluer Delacour (I hope I spelled that correctly), Lord Voldemort, Albus Dumbledore, and Viktor Krum. Moody was absolutely hilarious, especially when it came to ""teaching Malfoy"". Ron was a character who often had a kind of sense of humor that was dry and at the same time warm. (Spoiler Alert!!) I liked the scene where Harry and Cedric come back to the arena after the graveyard scene. It was portrayed very well. It was so sad I wanted to cry. Cedric was a cool character and he was very nice despite all the popularity he was getting after the champion selection. Fluer was a good character. I was afraid for her sometimes, (Spoiler Alert!!) particularly when she received her dragon for the first task and the last task, the maze. Viktor was very well-mannered. I wasn't phased by what happened to him in the maze. It wasn't his fault. Hagrid and the whole thing with Madame Maxime was quite funny. Albus Dumbledore was able to show a side to him we didn't really see before: nervous, anxious, confused, and frightened. And last but certainly not least, Lord Voldemort. My, my, what a character. I loved Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. He commanded my respect and attention in this film. As the director stated in an HBO first look special for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Ralph Fiennes is ""immensely well suited"" to play this character. He was creepy and a great form of evil. By that I mean I actually liked him being evil. Even just the look of him sent enormous satisfaction of the character into my body. I couldn't wait to see him again when I went to see the movie again two days later with my best friend and his family. To summarize this, I came out of the theater both times very pleased and very anxious for the film to come out on DVD. I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.",1
1015,8.0,"I am happy to say that the Goblet of Fire truly made up for the disastrous Prizoner of Azkaban. Mike Newell brilliantly guided the cast into a realm that no other Potter movie has been. There was a new level of chemistry among the acting group, which made me love them all the more. ",1
1016,10.0,"First and foremost, this is NOT a kids' movie. This is a story about a boy who is the target of a very ruthless, very violent, and very frightening killer. As Harry grows older, his problems grow more mature-themed, and Goblet of Fire is the major pivoting point. To parents who think they can just send their kids off to the theater for a cute little Harry Potter movie, be warned that you'll probably want to see it yourselves first before making that decision. This movie is scary. There are scenes of torture, mutilation, death, implied gore, and a bit of sexual innuendo (""What's got your wand in a knot?""). This movies is rated PG-13, and is about one slip of a mermaid's hair from being rated R. When I saw it in the theater, the outside doors opened at least three separate times so a parent could remove their child from the movie's influence.",0
1017,7.0,"This movie takes the caracters into the adult world, it shows all the danger that exist outside the school and in involves the characters, in this movie we learn that the world can feel like fun and games, but you have to be careful because the games can get too real and dangers.",1
1018,8.0,"I thought the film was one of the better of the four made. They missed many other plot lines, for example the whole ""Hagrid's mother is a giant"", there was also no mention of Doby or Winky. Another difference, some may considered unimportant, is at the end of the fourth book Harry gives his prize money to the twins, this does not happen in the film. I think that it does not set up the Twins joke shop idea, therefore, Malfoy doesn't have any where to go in order to get the blackening powder thing he uses in the 6th book in his plan to let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts and ultimately Dumbledore's demise. But I do understand various other plots may have been missed out due to time constraints, as GoF is a fairly lengthy book. ",1
1019,7.0,"I am a huge fan of the books and i have been waiting over a year to see the film. So there i am the first showing at my local cinema, all hyped up and.... i have to say i was slightly disappointed. I know they wanted to make it into 2 films because of the length of the book and i think they should of. Or made it at least an hour longer. Were they worried that people wouldn't see it if it was longer? Come on, everyone wants to see Harry Potter.",0
1020,,I am a big fan of the harry potter books and have read all the books at least twice as well I have been following the movies. Anyways Chris Columbus did a mediocre job with the first 2 that would appeal to all ages but mainly kids under 15. When I saw the Prizoner of Azkaban I was more impressed with the movie itself but less impressed with how accuratley Alfonso followed the book. Nevertheless the acting and even the the whole tone of the movie was darker this darkness in TPOA was passed on to the Goblet of Fire. I personally was very impressed with this movie and felt it had a much better flow then movie number 3. Unfortunately the Goblet of fire was my favourite book and I was looking forward to seeing some of my most anticipated parts from the book. For people who have read the book I think that most people who would agree with me that it was vital for the movie to show the scene in the book in the Hospital wing with Cornelius Fudge deniying that Voldemort is back considering that is so important in book number 5 god knows how they'll play that one out. Also many people I talked to were mad about not putting the house elves in but I disagree. If winkee cast the dark mark in the movie it would ruin the whole darkness theme. What I thought was more important was not putting the Dursley's in or not showing Harry giving his Triwizard winnings to Fred and George to start their joke shop. Anyways I've said enough about the book. The movie was great otherwise all the kids have vastly improved in their acting we finally got to see the Ron is not just a comical character and Dan's acting in the graveyard was fantastic. Like most people I agree that Allen Rickman is Proffeser Snape exactley. I just don't quite agree with giving Michael Gambon the part for Albus Dumbledore. He just dosen't have the Dumbledore touch that Richard Harris had. Anyways I give Harry Potter and the goblet of fire 8/10.,0
1021,3.0,i have to admit the film may be good if you haven't read the book but if you have it is a big disappointment as they miss out bit that many people would love to see. i mean i no they cant have everything in there as it wouldn't end but even so. i also think that the new Dumbledore isn't very appropriate for that role as the other actor (r.i.p) was a much calm soft and gentle character but this actor plays him as a loud in the film he Even pushes harry up against the wall and shouts at him even in the 3rd film he was like that when the fat lady disappeared when he was telling people move. it would have been alright if he had started off like that but even in the books he is known as the soft gentle loving figure.,0
1022,8.0,"This movie is by far the best movie so far. After getting used to all the changes that were made in the 3rd movie, the fourth movie is a blast. The first thing I have to say is ""VOLDEMORT RULES!!!"" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor). The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies. I can't say much about the story because there's nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that's to be expected with all films that are based off of books. All in all this is a great movie that deserves to be bought off the shelf and watched over and over and over again.",1
1023,3.0,"Before The Prisoner of Azkaban came out, I had wanted to see the potter films as each one came out and due to a DVD glitch shortly after the release of the first film, I decided to wait. Not long until the third film was hitting the the theater I watched the first two movies on DVD then headed out to see Azkaban. I was pleasantly surprised and I was now a Harry Potter fan!!!!!! Last night I saw 'The Goblet of fire' and I was..extremely disappointed. I am a movie buff and I know movies and this latest installment of Harry Potter was beyond sitting still. I was squirming in my seat to stay awake. I kept saying to myself that it is going to pick up and hit it's stride. Now the special effects were flawless however. Each seen in which special effects were obviously used were spectacular. I'm still trying to find out why this movie was getting duller and duller but am still in shock as to how it came to be that way for me. At times there were jokes that did make me laugh but they were too sporadic and seemed shoved in there. I heard that this film was the darkest of them all and most realistic. Maybe that was the problem for me. The magic was now gone and it seemed to take itself way too seriously. I'm done with my review because I don't want to seem like i am bashing it because I'm not. I just disliked this film and i advise each future viewer to go into the theater as seeing this as a stand alone film.",1
1024,10.0,"OK, I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series. The first three movies, I thought were pretty good. When I went to the Goblet of fire, I was amazed. You will hear from a lot of people, that they left a lot of the book out, which is understandable, considering that the book was 900 pages long. If they put every little detail in, the movie would have been 4+ hours, which is a very long time at the movie theater. But don't worry, the extended addition will add a lot more to the movie, so that the die-hard Harry Potter fans will be happy. The movie was more intense, which made a lot better. They showed a good bit of all of the important stuff, such as the Triwizard tournament. He who must not be named. LOL. The Rita Skeeter drama. So on, and so forth. This movie was great to see, and I recommend it to everybody. Go see it.",1
1025,6.0,"Of all the Harry Potter films so far, this is the one with the worst problem: it is truly /the/ most poorly edited film I've ever seen. Usually, one pays little attention to editing in a good film. In a film where the plot is not well-known, the editing isn't as noticeable; this is never going to be the case with most well-known adaptations of fantasy stories like the Potter series. Familiarity with the plot points make the scene transitions seem more, not less, important. That's where this film loses me.",0
1026,10.0,"This movie is truly enjoyable. I have seen it twice (yes, I am a Potter fanatic, so I might be more than a little biased.) However, both time I seen this film the entirely audience had an excellent time. Parents were not bored, and enjoyed some humor and a truly interesting plot. Children had some jokes placed in the film for them, along with some amazing visuals for everyone. Two small children did cry during the appearance of Lord Voldemort, but this film is not to violent for most children over the age of 5. Fans of the series will be delighted by some small touches placed n it just for them, and people who are not fans of the series will still be given a cinematic treat.",1
1027,2.0,"Personally, I choose not to recommend this film for anyone who is a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter series. OK, Richard Harris is dead. Condolences. But Michael Gambon did a terrible job as Dumbledore in this film than in the third. Seriously, someone bring in a better cameo. The film was rather rushed. They didn't really follow the storyline completely and made this a disappointment to J.K. Rowling's adaptation. Why are they making Ron shaggy all of a sudden? The classic use of the school, the characters, the lighting, and such has been lost as compared to what was used in the first two films. I was surprised to see that Brendan Gleeson was chosen to play Mad-Eye Moody, but the bad thing about this character was that they had to use a holder for his eye instead of just using special effects and enlarging his actual eye. The Yule Ball was OK. The introductions to the other two schools were OK. The dragon-fighting sequence was the only best point in the film. They made it more extensive, which was good. One character that I thought they were going to bring back was Dobby the House-Elf, because he was re-introduced in the book. The maze sequence was bad, mainly because the players were only attacked with lively leaves than the monsters that they encounter in the book. Most of the plot was missing, the acting was terrible, some of the action sequences were bad, and I was disappointed to see that no special features were added to the DVD edition. I didn't like this movie (or the third, or the fifth, and I am sure that I'm not going to like the sixth or seventh). Not entirely a proper recommendation for all you fans out there, but I guess you'll enjoy whatever suits you. I really don't know.",0

The third one could just be a different film not even based on the book they forgot so much. Now the fourth one could've been good but everything is just rushed. Well, what do you expect from a 734 page novel in to a 156 minute movie. They did leave out a bit of stuff but for the most part left a lot in. All the good parts take about 4 minutes to explain and then they jump to next scene.

1034,7.0,"I was really curious to see this movie. I had been waiting for it for months, I had seen all the trailers, I had looked up every thing of information about it...And then the day came I got to see it. It was the 1st of December 2005. I went to the cinema with a couple of friends, expecting very much...well, I've got to say that I liked it very much, but it was also quite disappointing. The whole film, especially the beginning, went so fast, you could really see they had to hurry a bit with making it...it was really, as actress Emma Watson said, going like 'tsjaktsjaktsjaktsjak', the scenes didn't really fit together, they were all standing apart, if you know what I mean. But this got better in the second part of the film. I liked the second part better. The Yule Ball scene was awesome (it was really my favourite): I was really impressed by the beauty of the set, though I already had seen it in the trailers...Emma Watson, whom plays Hermione Granger, could be given the prize of 'Most Beautiful Girl of Hogwarts' Yule Ball', she really looked stunning in her beautiful pink dress. What can I say about Emma Watson: I am such a huge fan of her, so it's normal I'm prizing her, but she really HAD such acted in an outstanding way. I liked the line 'Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you' very much, it's such funny and nice. What I want to say about the three young lead-actors in general (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma) is that they've really grown up. Daniel is sixteen years old, Rupert is seventeen and Emma is fifteen. Remember the time they were only eleven! Such wonderful how a kid can grow up...they've also grown in their way of acting. Such very nice. As I said, I liked the second part of the movie better as the first part. The Task-scenes were quite spectacular, I thought the Dragon looked quite real (I know, dragons don't excist, but I mean real in the way of a real creature). It was quite exciting, and so were the other two Task-scenes. The maze-scene was very nice...well-acted, and scary...the graveyard scene was even more exciting and scary...and in a way quite moving, I don't know why...I thought Robert Pattinson, whom plays Cedric Diggory, acted like he was death really well, it was such scary! One of the last scenes, where whole Hogwarts is sitting in the Great Hall, and where Dumbledore is speaking about Cedric, was moving too. Then something about the director, Mike Newell. A month after I'd seen Goblet of Fire I saw 'Four Weddings and A Funeral', also directed by him. I thought this film was wonderful. I won't say it's better as Goblet of Fire (I can't help it, I'm a fan, though GOF was disappointing), but I will say that Four Weddings was just directed better. So we don't know: maybe Mike Newell's a better director for comedies. Overall, I thought this movie was very nice, moving, scary, funny...but also disappointing.",1

1036,7.0,"Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, carried the series into a whole new dimension - that dimension being the thickness of the volumes. Almost twice the length of its predecessor this mega-tome was always going to be problematic to condense into a watchable movie. For my money, Mike Newell's result is a valiant, but predictably rushed and uneven affair that will leave fans of the series disappointed at what was left out, but that will also leave newcomers (if there are any people still in this category out there!) bewildered as to what on earth is happening. The movie felt exactly like the edited highlights of a much longer movie that had been roughly pasted together. As a side effect of having to race through the story, there is no time to develop any real depth in the characters, which is unfortunate. (In most cases, anyway: with each new episode I grow ever more irritated with Daniel Radcliffe's wide-eyed and mumbling performance as Harry.) Interestingly, the one character who displays any real passion is Voldemort, played by Ralf Fiennes, and I look forward to seeing more of him.",0

Yes the book was better every book is always going to be better then the movies. I say that I was very happy with this movie and can't wait for the next ones.",1
1041,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantastic movie and a more than worthy addition to the Harry Potter movie series. Ironically Goblet has always been my least favorite Harry Potter book. This movie isn't the most faithful to the book but in this case that benefits the movie. The book contains too much recap of previous stories, too many trivial details, and too many unnecessary subplots. The movie is much better paced than the book thanks to the removal of much unnecessary content. The filmmakers mostly made the right choices about what to include in the movie and what to omit. The main parts of the book are about the Triwizard Tournament and Voldemort's return. All three Triwizard Tasks and Voldemort's return are included so we're in good shape already. Other important scenes such as Moody's first class, the opening chapter, and Dumbledore's speech about Cedric are included. The only thing I would have done differently is that I would have omitted the Yule Ball and instead included more of Barty Crouch Jr's backstory. The Yule Ball is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the plot or the story. On the other hand it would have been nice to have seen the movie explain more of Barty Crouch Jr's backstory such as how he was smuggled from Azkaban, how he came to return to Voldemort, and how he came to be at Hogwarts. Barty Crouch Jr is an important character who is underdeveloped in the movie. Overall I think this movie was well structured. The casting and acting are outstanding as is always the case in Harry Potter. Amongst the newbies Ralph Fiennes gives an awesome portrayal of Voldemort. That graveyard scene really captured the darker tone the series is starting to take. Voldemort truly feels scary here. And Brendon Gleeson's Mad Eye Moody is so goddamn entertaining. So the new cast members fit right in with the high quality actors in this series. The special effects and visuals are awesome. Obviously the production quality is top notch. But there's more to it than that. The way this movie was made really captures the venture into darker territory Harry Potter is starting to take at this point in the series with its darker colors and cinematography compared with the previous Harry Potter movies. The settings and environments also help capture this. This movie knows what it is and where it is going and brings that out well. Andi really enjoyed how they made Voldemort. Patrick Doyle's score is good but nowhere near as good as John Williams. It's a shame that Williams couldn't score all 8 Harry Potter movies. The score heard here is good but a noticeable step down from John Williams classic scores on the previous Harry Potter movies. The pacing is mostly good. However the Yule Ball scene really drags on. When I watch this movie on DVD I skip ahead from Harry and Ron making up in the aftermath of the First Task to the part where Voldemort says ""Let me see it again."" and the movie has a much better and more enjoyable pace without the Yule Ball. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older. The emotional intensity of Cedric's death, the entire graveyard scene, Harry having to carry Cedric's body back through the maze, and Dumbledore's speech about Cedric are too much for elementary school children to handle. Faithfulness to the book: 5 out of 10. Casting and acting: 10 out of 10. Music: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Overall: 8 out of 10.",1
1042,6.0,"After the very good ""Prizoner of Azkaban"" HP attempts to keep to it's title, but unfortunately they placed their priorities wrong. I watched this film before I read the book, I didn't like it then and I don't like it now that I've read the book. Unlike the story suggests from the dark third one, ""Goblet"" focuses more on flimsy teen relations, and less on the evil that is growing around the school. At the end of the film, the most evil villain in the series is reincarnated, except through the tangled web of teens fighting, teens crying, teens going out, teens being stupid, this ending is diminished, at this point you say to yourself, ""who's this Voldemort guy who's being reincarnated?"" Then you have to remind yourself: ""Oh yeah! he's the evil creepo who's attempting to murder the main character and take over the world!, yeah I remember him!""..... urgh. The movies plot is mostly taken over by two of the main characters squabbling over going out and such, and if it's not taken over by that, it's consumes by Harry's conflicting emotions over his school crush Cho Chang. OK, if you're a female teen who likes chick fliks you might like this, but if you're an actually fan of HP it's next to impossible to take this one seriously. Well, there you have it. Goblet of Fire, you either like it or you don't, there isn't much of a middle ground to this situation. Oh well, at least they get it right in the next installment.....",0

1048,10.0,This movie is a must see film!! It is very exciting and humorous as well as frightening in some parts. The special effects are amazing and very realistic. Daniel Radcliff is great in this movie he shows deep emotion and determination in his role as Harry Potter. I would recommend this to anyone over the age of 10 as there are some scary scenes that would give younger children night mares. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time as it was a very gripping movie. However the movie is a quick and not as spread out as the book. Even though it is 2 and a half hours long. That is the only fault in this brilliant movie I would go and see this movie time and time again! One of the best movies of 2005!!!,1
1049,9.0,"Year 4 turned into movie is more satisfying than Chris Columbus's version of year 1 and 2. Prisoner of Azkaban, year 3 is where the story gets darker and more realistic. Prisoner of Azkaban had a ground hog day touch to it. I found that Harry Potter has stopped being a kiddy adventure from year 3 onwards in the sense that it has got more adultish and realistic. This is due to the fact that the characters are growing up allowing them for more mature and logical actions . Chris Columbus made the 1 and 2 movies very cheerful in tone, bright and just apt for the kiddies. The story at that time (year1 and 2) had the gang as little kiddies (which is what they were back then). Azkaban changed the trend. And in here Mike Newell (from Four Weddings and a funeral fame) creates a realistic movie in so far as the stunts and violence goes. Harry suffers bruises, people die ,and real death looms. This in part also because the story is writtent that way and also because the director chooses to emphasize that the movie and adventure is entering a darker tone. The cinematographys uses a dark charcoalish shade informing us of the impeding doom to come. The cinematography is as Gothic, operatic and grand in scale as Azkaban was. The Yule ball is a nice interlude from the tri-wizard tournament and is reminiscent of high school proms. Lovely book and a lovely movie. The complaint that movie is not true to the book is utterly stupid as you cannot faithfully translate a 700 odd page book into a movie. So you compress, and these guys have got it right. They compressed the right bits. At the end the 700 pg book has to work as a piece of film seen in over 2.5 hrs. And it works just right.",1

There is really nothing in the book that suggests that in this installment the pace of the action has to be stepped up like this.

Only very few scenes in this movie still have that quality, such as the one with Sirius talking through the hearth fire.",0

Dumbledore went senile. gone was the calm understanding man who had been harry's mentor. he couldn't help harry he was too busy yelling at, shoving and strangling harry. they also left out parts that would be important in the next movie like him giving the gold to Fred and George. that will raise the question 'where did they get the gold from to start their joke shop?'

After seeing the trailer for this movie I knew that it would be another great Harry Potter movie and I was right. The acting in this movie was fantastic. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, and all of the other actors did a great job. The CGI in this movie was unbelievable and I can't believe how well it really stood out. This movie has a good amount of action in it but mostly in the parts where Harry is competing in the Triwizard Tournament which gets pretty exciting to watch.

The film shows the emotional changes the three heroes go through even though every part of the book was not included in the film.I can't wait to see how the fifth book is done.

1062,10.0,"Having seen this film I was impressed with everything about it. The special effects, acting, music, locations etc were brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so. However, what annoyed me was the omission of certain bits from the film. Understandably, due to time constraints- keeping the film a manageable length, they could not include everything. I saw the stadium scenes in the trailer, and with these looking so spectacular, was hoping for a little more of that. However they barely focused on the Quiddich match at all, leaving out little details here and there such as the house elf Winky and her wrongful punishment for crimes she had not committed. We don't see her at all. In the book she comes with Barty Crouch JR hidden so he can watch. However he becomes free of his fathers constraints and it is he who conjures the dark mark hoping to scare both muggles, witches, wizards and especially those Death Eaters present who did not suffer in Askaban for Vodemort, like he did. He remains at large due to everyones belief that he died in Askaban some years previously and the fact that Winky was caught with the wand that did the spell. She covered up for him by removing the wand as he lay stunned and hidden from view. At Hogwarts, there is great speculation about the triwizard tournament and the contestants. Nosing around for store is one Rita Skeeter, journalist, busybody and gossip for the Daily Prophet. Inexplicably she is able to get great stories from inside the school despite being banned by Dumbledore. How does she do this? It is never mentioned. She sees harry collapse in Divination and declares him unfit for even attending school let alone the tournament. She catches Hermione with Krum and proclaims them to be an item, noting Hemione's taste for Quiddich players- him and Harry. We see, in the film, Hagrid and Madame Maxine talking about themselves but this scene remains unfinished. In the book we see Harry and Ron stuck outside listening to them, make a horrible discovery, that Hagrid is a half giant and so must she be. She denies it of course knowing that giants are fearsome, mean and violent and she'll get a reputation as being that to, or at least people will hate her or withdraw their children from her care. However, Harry and Ron are not the only ones listening in and the next day the front page of the Prophet has a full page article about Hagrid and his half giant status. How did she find out thinks Hemione who soon discovers the answer- she is an Animagus- that is, she can turn herself into a beetle and fly around picking up juicy tid bits about Hogwarts. Anyway. Go see the film and enjoy.",1

The story is really interesting and different this time, because two other magical schools, Beauxbatons from France and Durmstrang from East Europe, are visiting Hogwarts. The three institutes organize the Triwizard Tournament. There's one champion from each school who fights for the win. Of course, somehow, Harry is a champion, too, even though Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff is chosen before. The result is that there are four champions. All have to withstand three tasks. That's the beginning of the plot.",1
1066,10.0,"This, in my opinion, is the best harry potter yet. the first one was good, but i just don't really like the first ones story that much. the second one is the second best out of the four. it was really done well, and the anamatronics looked so real. the third was very good, but didn't seem lik a harry potter type of movie. this one, however, was just like i pictured it. it had so muc action in it. it had al the characters in it, and the tasks were the best you could make them. my favorite scene was the dragon scene. it was done like the books, with more. the only thing this one lacked was that it didn't have as much of of the story as it should have. there should have been an extended, 3 hour release that had more in it still a great movie 10/10",1
1067,6.0,"harry potter once again failed to live up to the books! the world cup match should have been an amazing thrill ride and was let down by the fact that it was more or less cut out. sections were cut that shouldn't have been and bits extended that shouldn't have been. also if you hadn't read the books you could quite easily have been confused by this film...once again it was a Hollywood blockbuster filled with crap and really poor acting. Ralph Vines Valdamort was terrible he was not even scary. I'm sorry to say but four the forth time i have been let down by people making the same mistakes. I'm sorry but even J.K.Rowling will be let down by something that could have been brilliant, also where were half the characters this time, just because you got the three mains doesn't mean the rest go out the window! DID you even read the books! i have to say i am upset that there was no ludo bagman no winky no dobby no bill or Charlie no durslys no Mrs weasly very little serious no buck beak, what about Rita skitters ending? i pretty sure she was a bigger character, dumbeldore was really poor...there was no hogmede trips does ginny ever speak? and I'm sorry but get someone who can act to play harry and hermione, ill say this though Ron wasn't bad and the best bit was when Ron told harry to ""p*** off"" i can no believe you let me down again! who ever wrote this film adaptation should not work in films again!",0

1069,1.0,"This movie should be a bomb... But it won't because of the popularity of the books. I've read all the books and just like everyone else, buy it on the day it's released. Then usually have it completely read the next day. The first movies were also less than spectacular, but the story line in this movie leaves you wondering, ""What happened to the rest of the characters? What of the house-elves, S.P.E.W, Padfoot meeting in Hogsmead, etc... What happened to Dobby? Did they not want to go into post production and make a little CG character? At least he was in the last one. They made short work of the first 12 chapters of the book, condensing them into about the first 15 minutes of the movie. You never see the twins Fred and George do anything more than try to get past the age line. Didn't they have a lot more candy and stuff? Didn't Harry give them the $$ to start their joke shop? There wasn't even a mention of the prize $$ in the movie at all! Don't these people read the books before starting a film based on said book? Basically my opinion is don't waste your money seeing this in the theater, even though I know you will. Next time, I'm waiting till it comes out on free TV like the others are now.",0
1070,7.0,"The movie faces the inevitable drawback of trying to fit in what actually was worth 2 movies into one.The book was huge , full of action and events.And so when they tried to fit all that in around 2 and a half hours , the movie , especially the 2nd challenge and the final duel with Voldemort had a hurried feeling to it ,as if it was originally scheduled to be long , but some heavy editing was done on those counts.So , before u know it , we have Voldemort arising ,calls the Death Eaters, chats up with them (just to register the fact that Lucius Malfoy was one of them), turns to Harry , slithers and challenges him to a duel , and then we have the wand connecting thing, the ghosts appear , and wham! before u know it, he's escaped. we get a feeling that this turned out to be too easy for Harry. on the positive side , the whole movie has a good dark feel to it, just as it should be.also , the first challenge with the dragons is simply superb.

1071,10.0,"This was the BEST MOVIE EVER. I thought that, after the 3h movie, I was going to be disappointed. First: I thought then that was the best movie ever and second: how do you put more than 500 pages in 2 1/2 hour? I didn't see the third movie in theater because it was in the middle of my exams. But this time, I couldn't wait until the DVD came out. So I asks some friends and at the 28th December, we went. When the trailers before the movie started I had this weird shiver all over my body. It was horrible, I thought I was going to explode. Even when the movie started I was still nervous, my Coke had to support some serious claps. The tension, the waiting, it was worth is all. I mean this movie was great. Romance, action, friendship, humor, it was all there and they managed to build the tension in that strange way until you actually couldn't take it anymore. I've seen a lot of horrors and thrillers in my life, but the only movies i've ever turned my head were 'House Of Wax' and 'Final Destination'. So when I came out of the building I couldn't believe it: me, I 15-year old girl, turned her head while watching 'Harry Potter'? At the end, it was deadly quiet, no one did make a sound and everyone had tears in their eyes. I've never experienced a silence that was so filled with tension. My best friend was even eating her popcorn bag (that was really funny).",1

1073,8.0,"This movie is by far the best movie so far. After getting used to all the changes that were made in the 3rd movie, the fourth movie is a blast. The first thing I have to say is ""VOLDEMORT RULES!!!"" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor). The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies. I can't say much about the story because there's nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that's to be expected with all films that are based off of books. All in all this is a great movie that deserves to be bought off the shelf and watched over and over and over again.",1
1074,8.0,"For all the things they had to cut out, the director really had his nerve throwing in the stupid things he did - specifically the goony dance numbers of the entry into Hogwarts of the other schools (to say nothing of the disgustingly gratuitous breast/rear shots of the Beauxbatons girls). I understand the cinematic need to differentiate the schools, but was it really necessary to change the other 2 schools to same-sex schools? That struck me as a weak, cheap ploy. The costumes and attitudes (which were terrific choices) enough would have worked - the director should have had some faith in himself.",0

Also it had many funny scenes and characters that are more mature than the previous films. Although it was a great film, I was disappointed by the fact that many elements included in the book , were cut in the movie. I'm sure that this was necessary so that the film wouldn't last more than 3 hours, but I would like to see , for example, how Harry's opponents ,in the triwizard tournament, dealt with their dragons .

I blame the director, he hasn't got the chops for this. Much too much of this film was left out, even if you haven't read the books. There was NO character development and what was filmed turned out to be a jumble of a plot. It was not at all coherent. Nothing made sense and I don't feel that it moved the story along well. I'm just glad it's over and I hope the next director at least is aware of this story. I wonder if it wasn't a bad idea to change directors for every film, too many divergent visions.

1083,5.0,"I just finished watching this movie, and I must say that I am extremely disappointed by it. I am not so much disappointed by how much was left out, because with a book the size of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, portions must inevitably be left out in order to produce a movie that one can watch in one sitting. (It wouldn't have hurt, however, to have added another 30 minutes to the movie (for, say, plot development). I am confident that even with a 3 hour movie, Harry Potter fans would have still turned out to theaters in droves.) ",0
1084,5.0,"I am an adult male (some would argue...). I fell in love with the Harry Potter books. I was very afraid when they were turned into movies. I hated the first one. The second was better. I thought POA was downright fantastic. It paid it's dues to the book, but was told in it's own form and style. .......Possible Spoilers for POA...... The whomping willow was fantastic. Bucbeak scenes let me feel as if I was flying. There was an overall comprehensive theme and feel to the movie. I think number 4 just fell flat. It was a good movie, but didn't have any of the feeling of the third. The YULE BALL was better executed on the Warner Bros. web site than in the film. It just lacks any real connection. The relation with Serus was nice. This film had so many opportunities to connect, but fell terribly short. The students from the other schools were merely walk-ons. I was just really disappointed. I was so excited by the third movie, this one really let me down. I enjoyed the fourth book far more than the third, yet the third movie was so much better. Oh well, let's hope for the next one.",0

1086,9.0,"This film is definitely a great Harry potter and of my favorites. There's a pattern i have noticed in the series that the films are getting darker and more thrilling each time. This one is very dark and i loved how they had a great mix of the triwizard tournament and then the ball i thought that was brilliant. The actors are very much grown up and better actors. What i didn't like is Dumbledore in this one, he seems to vicious and is the complete opposite to the original dumbledore who was very layed back. I liked how we saw Voldemort properly again.",1

1088,10.0,"Why do you people compare the Potter books to the films? I mean they're totally different things. I thought that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the best Potter film so far. Whoever thought that the film wasn't long enough or that they missed a lot of the book, FINE but I suggest you have a go at directing the film yourself and then we'll see how you could turn a 636 page book into a normal lenght film. As a huge fan of both the books and the films I think that you could enjoy them both without comparing them. I mean in the Goblet of Fire, Radcliffe's performance at the grave yard was absolutely stunning. I could almost feel the pain and fear myself. He just proves he's a real actor with every Potter film that comes out. Grint's just perfect for his character and Watson is so bossy, you can feel Hermione in her. To anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, I suggest you do because it really is a truly fantastic film and don't compare it with the book.",1

1091,8.0,"It is hard for me to judge the quality of a Harry Potter movie. Simply because I am in love with the book series. For me watching the Harry Potter movies are like reading very entertaining spark notes. They are there simply to remind me of the world of Harry Potter. This is not saying that they are horrible. In fact the movies are a great sample of the magic of HP. Having said that the fourth movie is no exception. It does a great job bringing to life the events of the Goblet of Fire and for the most part the emotions as well. However, it is difficult to squeeze a 734 or so page book into a 2-hour and a half movie. It just can't be done. Some of the characters as well as a large amount of the beginning chapters had to be cut out strictly for the sake of time. The first 30 minutes of the movie fly by and I remember sitting in the theater praying for the pace to slow down. Luckily it did, and once everyone in the theater took a breath, we were all able to start enjoying the movie. Not to expose too much of the movie and to let you make your own judgments I will end this review here saying that if you are a fan of the book series then I would strongly recommend you see it, you will not be disappointed.",0
1092,7.0,"This movie could have been the best but it is way too choppy. I don't know if the director or editing is to blame. This is Mike Newell's only outing as an HP director and the editors for the movies change quite a bit, so that is hard to say but I would have to argue for some of both. Anyone not very familiar with the books will probably get lost at various points of this movie simply because so much has been cut. I would say a minimum of two reads of the book are required to keep pace with the movie gaps. A few points that maybe adding 20 min on the movie and fleshing out a few areas would have helped with (this was a big book with a lot happening): some brief explanation of the Quidditch World Cup before dropping us in it and maybe at least a few flying passes of the game, fix the messed up arrivals of the two visiting schools (very chopped up), include the weighing of the wands with the important information about Fleur's heritage, there's also the plot change in how Harry gets gillyweed which I've never really understood why they changed it from the book, next there is the sudden arrival at the start of the third task with no introduction to the maze before to offer any transition. Then there are whole facets like SPEW that are cut that I guess I understand don't add anything to the main story, but purists find it hard to see them gone. One small thing that was added that I love as an all time favorite bit of acting from all the HP movies was the small scene with an annoyed Snape in the study hall when the trio are discussing dates to the ball. Genius acting by Alan Rickman. Overall conclusion is I really wish I could see an extended cut.",1

Now if you haven't been hidden in a trunk for 3 years, you would know that there's been a bit of a teenage phenomenon with a certain vampire series, Twilight, starring a certain handsome vampire that girls seem to be nuts about.

And subplots are great, but honestly books are always better than movies.",0
1101,7.0,"The most disappointing of the first four movies for a number of reasons, GoF is a good movie though significantly different from the books. I wouldn't be bothered too much by the differences with the book, but it is important to recognize that there are some crucial aspects to the story that one can't change or ignore. In any story of the genres associated with this story (coming of age and fantasy), until the end of the story, the young and growing hero learns from a mentor who is the intellectual fulcrum of the story just as the hero is the emotional fulcrum. We experience the growth and the emotional upheaval of the story with the hero but are comforted (just as the hero is) in the guidance of his/her mentor. This setup allows the focus to dwell on learning about the world the hero inhabits and the various tools needed to survive in that world. The mentor represents the storehouse of all knowledge about the world that we enter, inhabit and learn about (along with the hero). Thus the mentor also represents a sense of stability of the world. Only when the hero is ""ready"" is this stability removed and this is done usually by the loss of mentor or loss of contact with the mentor. For those who are not into fantasy and/or coming of age genres, consider the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings. (LoTR messed it up a bit as well, especially in the 3rd movie, but nothing so major.) The most disappointing feature of GoF was that both the emotional and the intellectual fulcrums are muddled. This results chiefly from the characterization of Dumbledore. Gambon gets the lion's share of the blame. Kloves and Newell are also to blame, Newell in particular for not restraining Gambon at all. It looks like they were all cheering for Dumbledore to lose all his marbles. Dumbledore in this movie is haunted, confused, scared, lost and so on - all that Harry is supposed to be! So, all sorts of dynamics in the movie are misplaced and there's a sense of chaos. May be they wanted to convey chaos, but we are supposed to feel Harry's sense of chaos, not that the entire wizarding world is lost. That happens in the future. Besides, as long as Dumbledore is around, there ought to be hope. That's the general idea. Here it's confusion galore! This weakness is major, because it shows that the people behind the scenes possibly don't understand the genre as much. That does not bode well for the rest of the movies.",0
1102,10.0,"I thought it was the best of all the movies so far. Probably because it can only get meatier now that they've reached the growing up, coming of age point. With the kids now teens and getting to do all that bumbling stuff over women that some of us can relate so much too.",1

The dementors are supposed to move like Mike Myers in Halloween or something! But, as bad as the 3rd one was, it was better than the 4th. The 3rd movie didn't have those really annoying things like the 3rd one had (Flying dementors, Tom the Innkeeper being a hunch-backed retard), but this movie just was bad. There wasn't anything good about it. Don't wast your money watching this movie. Heck, if you get to see it free, don't.

The direction in this movie--especially when compared to the first three--was incoherent and ignorant. It's as if Newell (the director) never even bothered to read the book or learn about the characters. None of the secondary characters are developed, and essential plot is removed to make way for childish little jokes and gimmicks. My biggest upset in this film was the way Dumbledore, a calm, collected, and brilliant man, came off as nervous and hostile. When I saw the scene with Dumbledore shaking Harry and yelling at him, I was disgusted. This is the only bad Harry Potter movie thus far. As a final thought, I think I should say this: I hate you, Newell.",0

One person posted a comment that she was disappointed about the bathtub scene when Moaining Myrtle joined Harry in the tub.

Where is Dobby and the other house-elf? And so many inaccurate things that I can't remember all. I read the book many times and hoped that the movie will be great too, but it's not even good.

I was not much of a Harry Potter Fan till I saw the first two But this one turn me into a believer. I love it so much that I bought the hardcover 6 pack. After reading the Book I see a few things were missing but overall it was still a very Good adaption. Though the Dragon Scene plays out better in the Movie then it was written in the book. And the Maze scene is not as exciting as it written in the book. There are some key elements missing from the books that is explain in the dialog of the movie so you have to listen carefully to everything that is said But overall it is still a 12 for those who have not read the books. Now I own all 4 movies and I can hardly wait for the 7th Book. I would like to still give it a 12 out of ten but I have to drop it back to 10 since I read the Book,1

Of course if everything would have been published the movie would last about five hours, but at last they could have put in the house elves and Hermione's organization. This movie is not dignified to be called Harry Potter. All the Harry Potter movies that were made by Chris Columbus are a thousand times better than this rubbish.

1112,10.0,I think this is one of the best Harry Potter movies there are and I have been waiting a long time for this movie and I thought that he was hot in 3rd movie and when I saw him in the 4th movie I thought he was out of this world. I thought that Ron Wesley was not that bad ether. I also thought that the maze part was really tense (I guess that I just HATE mazes because I got stuck in one once).I think Daniel Radcliffe is just the coolest guy he skateboards and so do I. I just can not wait for the 5th movie because I am sure that Daniel is going to twice at hot as he is in the 4th movie.When the movie was done I got on the computer when I got home and printed a whole bunch of pictures I had fun.

1114,10.0,"Harry potter and the goblet of fire is by far the best move from the Harry potter series. It not only talks a bout common teenage issues like, dating, asking a girl out for a dance, but also the magic and dark side comes to a climax. Lord Voldermort reappears as a vile, mutation of snake and human, full of hate towards Harry.",1
1115,8.0,"I know that the book was so long that some things had to be cut. However, it seems to me that whenever a cut is necessary it is always the softer, 'sensitive' and humorous side which gets it, leaving and even expanding the ""action"" i.e. violent side. All of Hermione's activities to save the house elves which are very funny sequences are omitted. But even worse, the manipulations which necessary to eliminate the roles of Winky and Dobby in the plot were not only complicated but made much of the Barty Crouch Jr stuff inexplicable. If I had not just reread the book, I'm not sure what I would have made of the whole thing. On the other hand we were subjected to that whole flying dragon thing which was not in the book and minute after minute of swimming thru mer-people and thrashing thru hedges. Those sequences could certainly have been shortened especially since the whole thing was so truncated that the tasks seemed squashed into each other. This is the third ""classic"" (Pride and Prejudice"" and ""OLiver Twist"") I've seen this year in which the director made perplexing choices in cutting. However as I always say, ""Any Harry Potter is better than no Harry Potter""",0

They couldn't explain anything in this movie.We can't even understand Hogwarts is a school,because all they care about is special effects and action scenes(including the extremely ridiculous fight between Harry and the Horntail).Most of the non-readers I spoke thinks Harry and Hermione are going to end up together!None of them understood what Priori Incantatem is! Ludo Bagman was not included!Most of the important scenes were cut out so they could include some ridiculous things.You can do better! Although I'm also a Lord of the Rings fan and never supported the fact it was being filmed,I have to give credits for Jackson's adaption,which was almost exactly the same with the book of masterpiece except some of the included scenes that made me angry in the Two Towers.My point is,it can be done!You don't have to change every scene in the book!!!

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a rather loyal fan of Chris Columbus'renditions but this one takes his work and matures it. The PG-13 rating is well earned and this movie is not for young children. Mike Newell's interpretation of J.K. Rowlings spectacular world is beautiful and logical. Unlike the last movie, Newell doesn't take the tried and true fans far from the original work. In fact, very little liberty was taken except to cut out what was not necessary. Also unlike the last movie, viewers who have not read the books will not find themselves confused by a lack of intelligible plot. One does not have to read the book to follow along this time. This movie has every aspect right and fans will not be disappointed. (That is, if you can take Daniel Radcliffe's mediocre acting.)",0

1131,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a solid adaption of the book. While everything was extremely condensed and at times missing transitions and a little bit episodic, the movie is full of action and some very funny puberty moments. Daniel Radcliffe improves a lot and delivers on the heartbreaking scene at the end of the tournament, and Voldemort is properly creepy and at times terrifying although I'm not sure the horror of the scene lives up to the one in the book for this viewer at least. The change of the maze was a brilliant touch as it is now very scary in the film and transitions very easily into the graveyard sequence. I don't agree with all the changes, especially how the movie feels very Harry/Hermione centered and how Hermione is portrayed (or is that just Emma Watson's overacted performance?) though a very very fascinating interpretation of Dumbledore that asks some necessary actions about his choices. Overall, the film is a good translation of the novel, and definitely fast-paced and amusing. The visuals are stunning, and the new composer adds freshness to the score. Miranda Richardson and Alan Rickman really stand out and give very funny performances. The film series seem to really be moving in the right direction, first with Cuaron's innovative direction, and now with Newell's continuation of Cuaron's world but moving into his own funny (dare I say more British?), fast-paced direction.",1
1132,8.0,"I loved watching these films, I love how every little detail all relates to one another. One of the final scenes when Cedric and Harry meet Voldemort, I think is one of the best in the entire series.

It becomes very powerful when Harry returns with Cedric's body. How everyone is cheering when they return only to find out the tragedy... one of my favorites! 8/10.",1

In the book they talked about how Barty Crouch was going insane and HArry left Victor Krum with him to go meet Dumbledore to help...however this was not shown and somehow no one (who maybe never read the book) would know what happened to Mr. Crouch. Also I remember reading about how BArty Crouch Jr. escaped from Askaban with his mother drinking polyjuice and exchanging places with him and she going to Askaban for him. I don't remember seeing that and somewhat the movie scenes were unclear. As I said again...no one shows how Mr. Crouch Junior got out of Azcaban or where or what happens to Barty Crouch.",0

1140,9.0,"Greatly enjoyed the film but could not at first understand why the quality of the music was so poor. I assumed that John Williams had been suffering from Potter overload, so unimaginative and repetitive was the score, until eventually the credits revealed the explanation, he didn't actually write the music for this episode of the saga, although a Williams theme from previous episodes was used endlessly and, apart from moving it into a minor key, almost without variation. For me, so much of the special impact made by the screen images and action in the first three films was enhanced and intensified by Williams' magical (literally) melodies and scoring, that the lack of those vital elements in the Goblet of Fire were deeply and disappointedly missed. Does anyone know why he didn't work on this latest film?",1

1143,9.0,"OK I have been reading what most people who did not like the movie have to say and all they are doing is moaning and whining about how good the book is and how much the movie sucked. OK before you start talking trash about a movie that was adapted from a book learn what it is like to try and adapted that said book to a movie. It is a major effort to adapt something, anything to a movie. Not to mention Goblet is one of the thicker books lets keep that in mind. That is the reason why the first 2 were more true to the books because that wasn't as much material to adapted duh, it has nothing to do with the directors, just because people have never heard of a director doesn't mean that he/she is a bad director (I would think that being old enough to write a review that people would be old enough not to hold such child-like concepts of directors/movie making.) It being so thick and long they did not have time to worry about such minor characters like the ghosts. I like the ghosts, I think they are a nice comic relief in the movies , but they do not drive the plot. Not the mention when you read you read at you own pace you control the pacing of the story, so therefore you think things are going to happen a different time then the screenwriter and/or the director does. People who are fans of the books before the movie have to understand that the movie cannot and I mean cannot be a word for, carbon copy of the book when it is a long piece of work like Goblet. The movie and book are two different things. You also have YOUR idea what it is and that is different for what the screenwriter can or should do. In addition with what the reader thinks the movie should be concerning characters, once again that is what the actor thinks the character should be not you so stop whining! ",0
1144,7.0,"This fourth Harry Potter movie did a decent job of condensing such a large book. As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, several plot lines and characters were left out. Most notably, no house elves, Dursleys, Veela, Rita Skeeter the Beetle, Hagrid's blast ended skrewts, and the Barty Crouch story. The movie crushes the first 150 pages of the book into about 10 minutes and after a very short International Quidditch match finds itself at Hogwarts in which students from other wizarding schools are also arriving for an extended stay and a chance to compete in the Tri-Wizarding Cup.",0

Dumbledore is now an overbearing, shouting, authoritarian instead of the thoughtful, soft-spoken genius he is in the books. Moody, while not bad, was very different.

That is where I believe they were wrong. This was a great movie, however to do the book justice and give credit to the actors abilities to bring life to the story... another 30 minutes or so I believe would have given this movie the depth and strength that it needed. Leaving characters out completely and not giving more intense interactions between Ron and Harry may have just made this movie not be one of the great ones. Don't get me wrong, what there was, WAS GREAT, yet I as a fan wanted more. I am a huge fan and love the books and I truly hope that the last several movies will give this wonderful series justice.",1

I cant say the same however for the movies, the first three i thought were...OK...but there was never the magic so to say that i saw in the books. I always wanted a little bit more from the movies. This movie however i feel broke that trend for me. When i first thought about them making this book into a movie my first thought was how the hell are they gonna pull that off. I honestly think that they did. There approach to this movie was to cut out a lot, and focus on the huge parts, i love the small parts of the books but i realized that they couldn't make that into a movie without it being 97 hours long, not that i would complain to sit threw a 97 hour long movie. They even managed to cut characters roles by combining their role in the book with other characters in the book. I.E. Doby + Nevil. Although i wish that the small stuff could have been put in, i think that the result without was great. I think that it would have been acceptable to add 20 minutes to the movie to make each task just that much longer, but i know that the typical movie audience wouldn't want that. I think these kids are really starting to get good at this whole acting thing. Nevel for example, man was i impressed by that kids acting, he had few lines in the movie, but man did he get to me.",0
1154,1.0,"I admit, I've only seen one of the other HP movies and have read none of the books. After seeing this movie, I'm glad I haven't wasted my time with any of the other movies/books. First of all, the filming was poor at best. Too many shots directly into the sun and hard-to-follow motion scenes distracted viewers from the pathetic plot. The story was missing crucial elements, and even though I forced myself to sleep through the second half I'm glad I couldn't understand the first part. For example, the movie starts with what you assume is a dream, and then all of a sudden six or seven people are touching a boot and flying. Why? No one really knows. The fun doesn't stop there. Moments later the city of tents is burned down by someone after a game no one bothered explaining and soon the wizards are competing in some contest with a bunch of people that haven't been introduced. C'mon, I know a little about the series, but some sort of introduction would have been nice. I award this movie no points, and may the director never find work again.",0

The chemistry between the main characters is brilliant, you can feel the ups and downs of the friendship between Harry and Ron, and also Ron and Hermioni. This is an ""edge of your seat"" movie.

In these respects, the way the film was adapted from the book was excellent. Other highlights for me were the underwater scene and the dragon chase.",1

All the scenes for the tasks were just incredible and exactly how I imagined them in the book. The creatures were just absolutely phenomenal in this film.

The only problem with it is the sheer volume of information that is cut from the book. But yes, I do understand that a 750+/- would make a very long movie, I still thank that even another half hour of screen time would have made it better. You cannot imagine my sheer disappointment with the Quidditch World Cup. A lot of subplot/trivial info was cut as well, like Fleur Delacour being part Veela, the Dursleys, or Rita Skeeter pestering Harry, Ron and Hermione terribly, and Skeeter being an unlicensed Animagus. There was even extremely important stuff cut out, too. Like Professor Trelawney not prophesying that Voldemort would come again.",0

The entire series is true to the writer. When watching the movie you see more from the book than you hear, just look around each scene. GOF was a difficult book to translate into a movie. As we go further into Hogwarts years, the more challenging it becomes to give everyone everything. If there's a any constructive criticism to state it would be that there was a missing connection with Sirius. Sirius' relationship with Harry was a strong GOOD and Hermione referencing to reporting to Siruis just wasn't enough but I can understand only referencing since that probably would have made the movie another 45 minutes long...of course, that would have been fine for me.",1

1165,8.0,"Bearing in mind my commentary on the previous three parts of Harry Potter, I can say that I am glad that this fourth part made my idea come true, that this film needs to be taken seriously and completed as soon as possible, so as not to remain trapped in the world of children's viewers. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire finally returned to the movie screen after a short break those interesting events and mystical events of the world of magic and the whole idea of JKR regarding the competition of three schools in which Harry Potter is suddenly involved. All praise for that. The plot of the movie holds attention and is really so beautifully blended with the characters and the story of Harry Potter itself, which easily gets its culmination. I wouldn't have any excessive objections to this part of the film for the simple reason that after the first part of the film, a sequel was finally made that looks like it, but with a better script, dramatic quality and an increased mystical and unpredictable level. The small objections that I might single out concern the evaluation of the characters themselves, where we neglected the first love relationships between the main characters who kept that childish approach and they need to be taken as soon as possible because the first love and feelings for someone do not look like that. They are a little more complex, more painful and more serious than what is shown. I will take the concrete example of Ron and Hermione. No matter how much they go in that direction to show their potential love as interesting and beautiful, the effect that is given is that Hermione is forced to fall in love with Ron. On the other hand, Harry and Cho Chang are portrayed as a necessary comparison of Ron and Hermione , and Harry is portrayed as a very big coward. The death of one of the more striking heroes is a great choice because the seriousness of the theme and the reality of the film rises to a higher level. But either way, in the next sequel I expect a more serious, darker, and more realistic evaluation because it's a good way to bring this film to the perfect evaluation it deserves.",1
1166,3.0,"It's a very good thing that what most people remember about movies and the like is the first and last things they see, because ""Goblet"" is one of those movies that has a mostly forgettable middle.

Brilliant moments featuring Matthew Lewis, the Phelps twins, and even a shining moment or two from Emma Watson are swallowed up in that great hulking plot mechanism known as the Triwizard Tournament.",1

What fun. If you see this movie, you are invited to a contest of champions and you'll face great danger. If you can't see it in theaters, it's not too bad,because it's on DVD on March 7,2006! So you have to watch this movie. It's the only one that show Harry Potter surviving 3 extremely dangerous tasks,only one that show's Mad-Eye Moody in it, and it shows a lot more when you see it! Even though it's PG-13,it still is good for 6-12 year old children.It might be scary for little kids.

1169,9.0,You really need to have read the books to understand this movie. Its a great way to market the books and make the 3 people in each country who haven't read the books buy 10 copies each! Its like Greek drama in this fashion - Greek theatre goers knew the beginning middle end and continuation of every comedy and drama that they watched - just like the majority of the people who went to see this film. Its a great visual expression of the book and it particularly captures the stumbling panic that Harry felt competing in the Goblet of Fire with everyone pushing at him from every angle (better even than the book did). The SFX are awesome and i loved the Hungarian horntail. They removed the exact right elements to translate the book and make it work on the big screen. The first 40 minutes or so are very frenetic and rushed though the last 2 hours more than make up for it when the movie finally settles into its stride.,1

Some people were even taking pictures of the screen when the ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" title came up on the screen. So what is with worth the wait?

Many important parts of the book were not considered on the movie, and when it comes to adapting books, this is important! The director has to consider the plot! He should read the books again before working on a new movie.",1
1173,,"I never thought it could get any worse than the last piece of Harry Potter crap The Prisoner of Azkaban , but damn was I wrong! First off, I have the book, but didn't read much of it (since it wasn't good and am not a fan of the Harry Potter books (I got it as a present and I was trying to be generous). So, I'm not the guy to give you those ""book-to-movie"" comparisons. Now, on with the damn review! The Goblet of Fire wasn't Harry Potter at all! Not that many creatures or magic is seen (which is a load of crap), and is way more of a love story! No, I'm kidding you! Goblet turned out being a fantasy love story at Hogwarts. Harry loses best friend, tries to get revenge, his crush Hermoine (and don't give me any crap that he doesn't like her) falls in love with another man and he is now depressed. Let alone, he's in a god damned Triwizard Tournament (which we don't see much of, just hear about it a lot and see some off-court punking). This ruined the whole damn movie! Sure, Prisoner was a big pile of flaming dog crap (you know, the kind you leave on people's porch) and left a stench for miles. But, at least that stayed to the Harry Potter tradition: The magic and the creatures. Goblet destroyed that by slapping in some sappy bullcrap that made me crap my pants worse than the time I had that ""weird and unusual"" dream about Joan Rivers *shudders*! I hated it! Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane, Ocean's Twelve ) was ruined here! He too had a love interest *breaks out in laughter*. Sorry, I just don't see him in a relationship. I can already imagine the date: ""Hey, you wanna go to my house and I can cook up some ""special"" potion for you?"" God, I just don't see it happening (though I just did). Anyway, like I said, Hagrid was ruined here. He gets a lovebird (which, like mentioned before, is laughable and disastrous). But, worse than that is his lack of screen time. What the hell? This guy is an icon in the Harry Potter franchise, and you just give him a few scenes and give him his pay and a big-ass bucket of ""Popeye's"" chicken. Damn! There was also a disturbing scene in which Harry is getting a bubble bath (wtf?) and that ghost chick that hides out in the bathroom , but I'm not getting into that because I'm already having nightmares about it. And I haven't even gone to bed yet! This movie was just a putrid mess! Harry Potter magic and creatures are replaced with sappy love story and Hagrid gets a crap taken on him by the producers! Not worth the almost three hours length.",0

1175,8.0,"I would have given the first movie 4. Watchable, but just barely. The second a 5, dragged down by that god-awful ending. Third movie a 6 1/2, a definite improvement. This one scored a solid 8. It honestly left the other three in the dust, if you haven't seen this already go and see it! The beginning of the movie was very well done. I have to say that the fan in me was a little disappointed, wanting to see scenes that I have poured over in the books many, many times, but I squashed that little voice down, knowing that seeing those scenes probably would have been a disappointment in itself - one the movie would be unlikely to recover from. Yes, it would have been nice to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, but it does not add to the story so would be unnecessary distraction, and the Death Eaters more than made up for any shortening - they were frightening, the scenes were chilling in their realism, the terror and the racial persecution. I also have to say I'm thankful to whoever left the house elves out of it. Winky may have served her purpose in the book, but Barty Crouch Jnr. was far more sinister without her interference - as he should be.",0

This is by far the best one for adult viewers and still appeals to the young people as well. My son and I both agree that this is the best one so far and I hope that next ones will be as good. The movie has a tight storyline as expected and the cinematics are superb. The only complaint I would have is that the story was cut up so much to make it fit into the time line of the movie. If you are interested by the movie, I would recommend reading the book to get the whole story. As a matter of fact if you are interested by the movie and haven't done so yet, read the stories from the beginning.",1
1180,1.0,I have started to watch the movie i commend the actors in the movie and the book has brought my family closer together. But the Goblet of Fire is a disgrace to that book and the essence of Harry Potter fans. I was insulted when Dumbledore actions when that IS NOT DUMBLEDORE. The actors were perfectly cast. I adore Harry Potter and I am a complete NUT about them. These books got me to read again. Movie 1 and 2 held the essence Movie 3 lost some of that and 4 was a total disgrace I commend you the actors and you J.K. Rowlings for bringing the greatest book to me and my families lives. Unfortunately the movie makers have as usual have ruined the essence that they KNOW should be there for their own BS in time restraints. Here is a hint MAKE ANOTHER FREAKING MOVIE PUT IT INTO PARTS you IDIOTS. DOES it work well lets see it worked with Lord of the Rings it worked with Stephen Kings IT it worked with Robin Hood. Hmmm maybe it is you not the fans that might want to rethink things . Like i said i adore the books. The movie is i am sorry to say is not good at all.,0

The opening was excellent, excellent, as soon as I was thrown into that opening like the book -- I was hooked again and could remember every nuance of the book -- it was a brilliant opening!

Between 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and 'Goblet of Fire' you see the former having almost no mention whatsoever of the evil Lord Voldemort, whereas the latter closes with his dramatic return. While I prefer the third BOOK to the fourth BOOK, as far as the movies go, Daniel Radcliffe and Co. have, with the film version of Goblet of Fire, topped the Azkaban movie, which I never would have expected.",0

What I mean is this: one cannot disclaim one of the movies solely based on the fact that it was different from the book or less than a mirror image translation. The chasm between novel and screen is a difficult one to cross.",0

Although this movie is a lot darker than the others featuring the return of Lord Voldemort and then death of one of harry's friends, But it was overall a great movie! I thought that this movie wouldn't be any good because lately the director of each movie has varied...but all directors stuck to the books, well most of it anyway, As a big fan of the book i was slightly disappointed by all the stuff that was missing although all the vital stuff seemed to be there, if you only want to watch an exact interpretation of the wondrous books then this isn't it, it tells the story just a well as J.K Rowling wrote it but in less detail.",1
1187,3.0,"I really miss director Chris Columbus. This version of the Harry Potter books was a tremendous disappointment. The house elves, important to the story, were left out of the movie altogether. The development of the other Triwizard Champions was severely limited. While I cried over the death of Cedric in the book, the movie version was hardly emotional at all, since Cedric was portrayed as a minor character, and not adequately explained. Same thing with Fleur and Viktor. They were both very minor in this adaptation. We did not get to know them or care about them, at all.",0
1188,7.0,"I saw this film the night it was released, and I had been waiting a very long time for this one, and what I expected to see was a masterpiece. What I got in return was a choppy and rushed film. The scenes were too rushed, a lot of major plot points were missing that should have been there, and the scenes that needed to be cut were there instead. The Tri-Wizard tournament was good, but there were things in those tasks that were importantly missing, and parts added that were never there in the first place. Now, nevertheless, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stands as the best book turned movie in the Potter franchise. Some reasons: The new director, Mike Newell, is the first Brit to direct a Potter film, and he brings some good humor and visuals to 'Goblet.' His ability to create a world of happiness and darkness at the same time was remarkable.",1
1189,8.0,"I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured many thrills, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy, but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and didn't play a great role in the film. This movie also managed to balance the gritty, darker tone and the comedic aspect incredibly well and left me completely enthralled throughout the duration. The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. The reason i find this film so good compared to others in the series is once again the plot. It manages to capture the magic so well, as well as making it different from others. The action is done incredibly well and the final scenes are a masterpiece. I was on the edge of my seat throughout and believe the cinematography will hold up for many years to come.",1
1190,9.0,"The movie is about Harry Potter's fourth year in Hogwarts and that means we're going to see more troubles. It's so nice to see the kids growing up, especially the Weasley twins. They are the clown of the show and their appearances on screen are awaited. This year's highlight is the occurrence of the Triwizard Tournament held in Harry's school. Students from other wizarding schools came to compete. When Harry became one of the contestant, people's reactions varied from envy to worry. He had to work his way on this without the usual help from his pals. Meanwhile, he was also haunted by his recurring nightmare about Lord Voldemort.",1
1191,6.0,"I just attended the midnight screening of the movie here locally and left feeling very torn as to how I felt about it. If you are a big fan of the movies you are going to love this one, it has everything you could want in a Harry Potter movie and everything wraps up quite nicely. If you are a fan of the books however you are going to be left with a big hole in your heart as this leaves out entirely too much of the story for it to resemble the book. Normally I wouldn't care if a movie strayed from the book, but this one not only strayed, it changed major plot points and left very important material out entirely. I'm not going to name specifics of what was left out and what was left in, or even go into detailing why I'm mad about them being left out, because I don't want to bash the movie, because it was done well, and I want to be sure it does get credit where credit is due. I am interested to see what happens next though, I have just started reading Order of the Phoenix, so I'm anxious to see if any details that were left out come back to haunt the film-makers, though I have a feeling that Steve Kloves wouldn't allow anything to be cut that was important to the overall story-line. But through all of this it is very clear that Mike Newell, though talented and is successful in making a great movie, definitely missed what the focus of all the books is and how the characters should behave. I doubt that the book was read by the director beforehand and doubt further that if it was read that the others were read along with it to get the point of the series and what makes them good and engrossing. I'm glad I saw the movie, and I will get the DVD when it comes out, but I will keep notes handy to explain to friends that watch it what all REALLY happened in Hogwarts that year so they don't miss the important things along the way.",0
1192,7.0,"I beg you to replace Michael Gambon or to modify his character because his acting is ridiculous and it humiliates the figure of Dumbledore at the same time. He has NOTHING in common with the character of the book and I don't understand why it was needed to change his features. It does not influence the length of the movie and I don't think it would require more money to be faithful and consequent to the original character. Why was it necessary then? Please, explain, why did they turn Dumbledore into a clown!!! As opposed to the first actor I mentioned in my opinion Ralph .. was the perfect choice to represent the unique character of The Dark Lord. His acting abilities made him absolutely appropriate to provide the audience with the characteristic features of the original figure of the book. In the question of authenticity I would highlight the performance of Alan Rickman ,Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Ralph Fiennes. I believe they personalized the characters of the book in the most ""loyal"" manner",0

Personally this is my favorite book of all the series and obviously some of it had to be cut out. I think that Mike Newell did an exceptionally good job. He cut off parts of the book but made it so that it would be understandable for people who have not read the book. I loved the movie. Very sad, yes, but that's Harry's life in general. Its the first time a movie gets me as emotionally involved as Goblet did. Ever since it started until it ended.",1

I know they can't put everything in the movie because the books were so long. I was hoping they would put in the house elves again, I loved Dobby in the second book and film. I was also hoping they would show Bill and Charlie Weasley joining there family to the Quidditch game. I was hoping to see Oliver Wood again, I loved him in the first two movies. Overall it still was good. The directer and the producers did a great job keeping to the book.

I literally almost cried at one very crucial scene that is going to affect the rest of the movies from there. I wished I saw the look on the readers's faces as they read that particular part. This movie being nominated as worst work, whatever poll on this website is rubbish! Movies like Wolf Creek and Narnia should be on that list.",0
1199,4.0,"If you did not read the book, there is no way you will understand what's going on during the movie. I think the director made the assumption that everyone has read the book, and therefore left out explanations of why some things happened. I mean I understand he can't include everything from the book, but he left out some pretty significant parts, like the house elves, Ludo Bagman, etc... And when the director strayed away from the book, he created scenes and dialogue that weren't very good at all. And none of the scenes were very effective because I don't think any of them were longer than 5 minutes except for maybe the dragon scene. I definitely think that this book should have been split up into two movies, and I hope that is what they do with the next book.",0

The previews looked no more than cute, and when the film premiered on HBO I tuned in, and for two hours I lived in Harry's world.

The movie is set in Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, amidst the Triwizard Tournament that the school is hosting. The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and the final image of Lord Voldemort matches the description in the novel perfectly. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is - by far - the BEST Harry Potter movie so far! It's much more than a series of action scenes put together: there's heart and a journey towards personal discovery that Harry must follow. Stunning!

The additional footage of Harry's dragon challenge left me wondering, ""Did I miss that in the book""? (Of course not, since I've read it 4 times.) There's just one thing- was it trick photography, or was the actress playing Madame Maxime REALLY that BIG????? The movie soft-pedaled the resulting friction between Albus and the Minister of Magic, making it difficult to fathom the animosity that prevails in Order of the Phoenix. The absence of Sirius Black in the final scenes is a disappointment; however, some things HAD to be cut to avoid too much fiscal heartburn at Warner Brothers.",0
1207,6.0,"I know that to put the whole book into the movie would mean that it would go on for hours and hours but I was quite disappointed at how much they cut out. Especially Hermione's spew campaign with the house elf's. The scene with Voldemort coming back it drags on and on. The yule ball scene is good, the dress robes look exactly like they should. I don't know why but i think that Durmstrang academy was a co-ed school in the book. The maze in the tri-wizard tournament was well done but it wasn't how I imagined it. Bill and Charlie are never shown in the movie and i thought they would because of the dragons. It was a good movie where I was interested pretty much the whole way through.",0

Besides, what they did was fine. You just have problems. True the movie was fast but they really had no choice. So if you have such a problem then don't bother people with your bad attitude. Do you not realize that the number of people who like the movie far outnumber the people who don't like it?

When Cedric dies it is very tragic and almost makes you want to cry because the acting at that point by Daniel Radcliff was excellent! The only reason it is PG-13 is because the dragons might scare little kids, but honestly, tell your kids to cover their eyes and they should be fine. Overall the movie was great and I think J.K Rowling would be proud to be associated with the movie!",1
1214,3.0,I went to see this movie last night expecting the film to be as great as the book. The first scene in riddles house was great but after that it just went down hill. Many things were cut from the book that should of been in the film just for the sake of character development but instead were sacrificed just to show the tri-wizard tournament and ILM's special effects. That's pretty much all the film was was the tri-wizard tournament. Most of the effect were cheezy as was the unneeded humor. It had the problem of putting to much information into too short of a film. This had the potential to be a great film if it would of focus more on the book or maybe if they would of split it into two films.

Another thing that makes me have a little hate on the film was the director (Mike Newell), he complained about the book in every interview saying it's so thick and so long, I wouldn't want a director who complains about the book. He's great with the kids and everything but he originally planned for Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest during the first task and have the dragon burn it down after it got loose of its chains, even a 7 year old heck even a person with half a brain would know this is the worst idea ever since it's Rowling's favorite part of the Hogwarts grounds and there are too many magical creatures to count. Although it is a good film I'm not saying it's complete garbage but there are a few things that make it seem like the type of movie to have some more hate than the rest. Sorry if I sound too rude but this is all just my opinion and If you have a different opinion that mine, that's ok! Everyone's opinion is different and I don't have judgement.",0

The past 3 movies have done a respectable job (though seem to stray from the original story with each progression).

More time should of been spent during the events that occurred between the challenges. On a positive side, the scenes of the tasks were very well done and I enjoyed them.

The movies are and accessors for the books, and that is the same reason why they must be as accurate as the books, and this time (only in this movie because the past ones are very well adapted) they just didn't that spot. I read the book, and I loved it, and in the movie there were some parts I was completely lost, there were parts missing, many parts missing. It's O.K it was a matter of time, but hey, if you need to do a 3 hour movie, or break it in two, go on. But please just don't mess the story.

1221,7.0,"First of all, I'm a big fan of the HP books and have read them all. I went to this movie (with my children) with very high anticipations considering this was one of my favorite of her books. However, it was clear in the beginning this wasn't going to be that kind of movie that stuck pretty close to the book.",0
1222,10.0,I caught an advanced screening of this movie and I absolutely loved it. It really takes a British to film it accurately. It's a shame Newell only got 1 million to direct...he deserves double what Chris Columbus got (10 mil for the 1st film).,1

1225,7.0,"So the latest instalment of the Harry Potter series is among us, and to be honest, it is a bit of disappointment. Mike Newell seems to have missed a trick and this film, is one of the weaker adaptations from JK Rowlings epic series.",0
1226,,"this cost 308 million? why? the last one was way better, this one looked cheap. for the average movie goer who isn't obsessed with harry potter, its not that great. you may get lost. and what's up with the Russian love interest of Hermione. ill say this, there were some pretty funny parts. which was good, but honestly, the last movie was better, style wise, etc. some of the special effects in this one weren't even that great. they should have made this into two movies. no debating. but i guess they don't need to appeal to the average movie-goer. there's enough potter book fans that it doesn't matter. also, i swear to god, one of the death spells Voldemort casts on Harry is Abra-cadabra. the competition was cool. that's about it.",0
1227,6.0,"As I attended the first showing of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire last night, I found myself trembling with anticipation. Admittedly, I am an adult Harry Potter junkie. My husband and I own all 6 books in hardback and all 3 movies that are currently out on DVD. We were among the first in line at our local theater to see Goblet of Fire. However, my anticipation quickly dissipated as the movie began. My first disappointment came when Mike Newell chose to quickly cut to the port key on the way to the Quiddich World Cup. He chose not to preface the Cup at all and left anyone not as familiar with the books as I am incredibly confused. I heard numerous rumblings around me of people who were already lost at that point, less than 5 minutes into the movie. I felt that the movie continued to disappoint in the minute details that Newell chose to alter to suit his needs. One that stuck with me at the time and continues to stick with me the morning after is his decision to put the Patil twins both in Griffindor house. This is not true to the books; it is mentioned in the very first book that even identical twins don't end up in the same house. I am also disappointed in the way that Hermione was portrayed in this film. I feel that instead of being the valuable Harry Potter friend that she's been in the last 3 movies, she was depicted as being a tag along. Emma Watson was given very few scenes in which to give viewers the true essence of Hermione. The scene at the end of Yule Ball on the stairs is a fleeting example of her talent used sparingly. I was disappointed too to see that Mike Newell had completely changed the look of the Griffindor common room. Although it has been featured only a few times in the past 3 movies, it was a shock to see him make changes to such an important place. All-in-all, I feel that this movie was good and lived up to the Harry Potter name...but, didn't do the book justice. It's impossible to cram a book of this magnitude into a couple hours of film. Although I am not advocating making the film longer or making it 2 separate movies, I am stating disappointment with the decisions that were made. As previously stated, I feel that this movie in its entirety left to chance that viewers were extremely familiar with the Harry Potter legend and with the Goblet of Fire book itself. I do hope they don't make the same mistakes with Order of the Phoenix, which should prove to be an even bigger challenge.",0
1228,10.0,"this was in fact the best one so far what do you think my favorite part was all of the challenges they were (in the words of Glen Quagmire and Peter Griffin) Giggity Giggity Frickin Sweet! I have no idea what to write because the comment box won't let me go any less then 10 lines so ill talk about the characters Fleur DeLecour (sp?) was pretty hot as with the rest of that school (except for the headmaster) So was Cho Chang, And am i retarded or did anyone else not know that the Patil twins were Indian????? any way i think thats 10 lines so ill stop now bye bye.... OK crap thats still not enough so ill say that the special effects were Frickin Sweet, Acting was Frickin Sweet, and if you are gonna go see the movie DO NOT go to a show where there will be a lot of young children because i went to a sneak preview and there was tons of kids and they would scream at the scary parts and uggggggghhh i wish i could have seen it at a different time so thats all the time i have for today so until next time same black hair same black channel good night everyone",1
1229,9.0,"I was a bit concerned going in. How would a 600+ page book translate into a 2 hr and 37 minute movie? After seeing the film, I have to say that they translated it admirably. They obviously skimped on some of the details, but less noticeably than in Prisoner of Azkaban.",0
1230,5.0,"This movie was entertaining in some of its scenes, but in many of them I was disappointed. They added too much to a certain scene or too little to others. I don't think they should have been concerned about a time limit because Harry Potter fans would have watched it no matter how long. Just how King Kong is 3 hours long but still fans went and saw it. I was very disappointed to find out that they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup. And also in a couple of scenes they really messed up the plot. I do not see how they are going to continue some of the important aspects of the other books into the next movie with the plot being played around with the way it was. They showed the dragons very well. The certain competitions were also well created.",1
1231,8.0,"well, first off i must say that i am a huge fan of the books, all six of them, and thought the first three films were, at best, disappointing. Some faith in the franchise was restored upon the release of the third installment, though they have really hit the money with this one. From the moment it started i was in, totally hooked, enthralled in this masterpiece. I loved every second of it, and also loved how the director had shaped the film, it was as if i was forgetting that it was just 'the fourth one', and accepting it as a very smart, tricky little mystery/thriller/comedy. Performances, especially from the not-so-young-anymore, were great. This film captures the essence of the series perfectly.",1
1232,,"This Harry Potter movie was the worst Potter movie I have ever watched. After reading the book numerous times and then listening to it on Books on Tape even more, I was expecting something amazing, something that would surly surpass the first three movies. Yet, this movie fell dismally short of used toilet paper. I felt sick after seeing it. I had been looking forward to it since I first heard about it. But again I was let down. There were so many important and relevant characters that were not only left out, but completely ignored. These characters are paramount in the development of the story and how this story leads into the next. I cannot believe that J.K. Rowling even Okayed this script. Is she so concerned with money that she would not stop something so terrible? Where are her morals and beliefs, especially when it is her hard work being put on a movie screen for every one to watch? I have been reading the reviews of this movie on CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, and Google and all the ""move critics"" that have written these reviews cannot stop raving about how wonderful this movie is. Do they know a bad movie when they see it? Did these movie critics even read the book? Do they have any idea what is not happening in the movie? And who is not in it? Or are they so busy with making sure that they sound good that they don't want to step on any one's toes? Where are their stones when it comes to criticizing? That they choose to kiss ass then actually report the fact that the movie sucked is pathetic. This movie sucked. This director sucks. If you want to know how a person will do in the future, look at his past. His past movies sucked, this movie sucked, his future movies will suck. If he is directing any more Potter movies I will refuse to see them and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Stick with the book. Hollywood does not know how to anything correctly. 2 and ½ hours of crap. 2 and ½ hours of watching a half ass-ed director slash and hack at an amazing book and butcher the imaginations' of children is unbearable. Worst Potter movie ever.",0
1233,6.0,"Can't say I'm impressed with either the Director or the writers. Compared to the book, this movie is like reading Cliff Notes with Dislexia. I understand you can't do everything...wait, no that's not true. This book could have been translated perfectly in a four hour movie, with intermission. I would gladly have paid double for a ticket to see a GREAT movie versus the hacked flick I saw. The majority of the movie seemed small, condensed and rushed, like Luke warm Happy Meal without the prize.",1
1234,,"I just got back from the opening night of Goblet Of Fire in Canada and i loved it! I mean it can;t get much better, except maybe the beginning could have been longer. After when Harry goes to Hogwarts, it doesn't seem rushed at all. I love Mad Eye, perfect casting by the way, and the Triwizard Tasks worked out perfectly. Ralph Fiennes is just amazing acting, but the thing that got me a bit was Voldemort. He wasn't as scary as i pictured, but it still wasn't totally disappointing. Anyway this movie is the best out of all movies, and definitely one of my favorites. This movie will definitely make a huge opening, and will be loved by Potter fans everywhere!--10/10",1

Even they left behind some things of the book, the movie is still excellent, with all the story, characters, and special effects.

1237,7.0,"Ah, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The film marking the beginning of a new era of Harry Potter films. We see the series take a turn into darker territory. Harry Potter is still played by Daniel Radcliffe, Ron's still got red hair, Malfoy is still being a horrible person (or should I say ferret?) and there's a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for the fourth year running. All in all, it's a pretty normal year apart from the tournament. Yes, the Triwizard Tournament. With a name like tri-wizard you'd expect three wizards, but no, they've thrown you off and given you four. It should be such a memorable film. We have the grand Yule Ball, the huge Quidditch World Cup, and the dramatic ending with Voldemort being reborn once more and fighting Harry, and losing (again!) But is it as memorable as it should be? No, it's just forgettable. I remember the first film, when Harry is introduced. I remember the second, when he's still a good character. But it's becoming less about the main character as it goes on.",1
1238,8.0,"Great Harry Potter movie. For those (who are most of us) who have read the books, this movie cuts out about 40%, where part 3 cut out 20% and 1 and 2 cut out less than 2%. This is because the books have gotten bigger, and the directors have changed.",0
1239,9.0,"When asked what I thought about Goblet of Fire, I responded, ""Better than the others, and I loved them!"" Mike Newell did a fantastic job! The movie opens quickly, jumping right into the action. Within the first fifteen minutes, we've experienced Harry's nightmare, the Quidditch World Cup, the Dark Mark, and the Hogwarts Express. Not once did I feel like the movie should have been moving along faster.",1
1240,10.0,"Wonderful special effects and sets make this film a great event worth watching. Part of the fun is how much the series allows you to be part of the characters' lives. Such as, how they are becoming obviously, more mature. I highly recommend this film. Another fun part of this film series is how different ideas and objects are introduced. The school is the same, but there are new characters which we learn about as we watch. The fantasy of a person flying in the air with a broom is enchanting, however, it is just that, a fantasy. The sadness I felt as the story unfolded was a little unsettling, but it was just a story, of course. The costumes were, as usual, great, and Maggie Smith was wonderful as one of the professors. The other actors were fabulous in their roles. Have a great time watching!",1
1241,10.0,"Excellent attempt at summarising the book... however, as I usually find,the plot was somewhat scant and could actually be disjointed at times. Some of the brilliance that is JK Rowling obviously had to be compromised, with some of the book's sub-plots being completely omitted (as obviously necessary). Lets face it, who has the money to make a six hour movie to include everything? Radcliffe's performance is wonderful as Potter. Snape is almost completely lost as a character. Dumbledore seems to have lost his powerful presence somewhat. A lot of the tension in the book is just not here. The final scenes, however, are truly magnificent.",1
1242,10.0,I loved this film it was excellent and the scenes to the end were amazing i give it 10 out of 10 everyone should go and see it the effects and acting in this film are brilliant i definitely recommend it they managed to get quite a lot of stuff from the book into the film whoever decided to take on these films are truly amazing it was definitely worth making all of the movies and i also hope there will be many many more to come cant wait for the next one keep them coming Many thanks to JK Rowling for creating these amazing books i am currently collecting a set of them they are brilliant to read anywhere and you just cant put them down once you pick them up they seriously have the best story lines,1
1243,5.0,"I had VERY mixed feelings after watching Goblet of Fire. As someone who's nuts over the books, I highly disagreed with the direction the director pushed the movie in. The movie would have been SO much better (perfect even) if, instead of piling on joke after joke about the yule ball and hollywoodishly (is that even a word?) over-dramatizing the first task, things more central to the overall plot were included - the introduction of Bill Weasley, some buildup to the excitement of seeing the quidditch world cup, actually SHOWING the quidditch world cup itself instead of just the opening (which was in itself very flawed compared to the book), Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts, Rita Skeeter's Animagus status, the Sphinx in the final task, etc etc. Not saying I didn't laugh at the jokes (ron saying ""bloody hell"" at the beauxbatons' entrance sticks out), or that I didn't appreciate the amazing visual effects - just that I wish the movie focused more on the rest of the story than the yule ball. oh, and I forgot to mention, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is simply ingenious. I couldn't even begin to imagine someone who could play the part better, and his appearance was EXACTLY how I imagined Voldemort would look. Overall, it's still an entertaining movie and definitely worth your money; but it seems like it was made for the people who have only seen the movies and never read the books.",0
1244,10.0,"I was very exited for this movie, because a love the other 3, Askaban was my favorite and still is. Goblet of Fire has a nice story, but in the movie the story got a little to confused, the effects was nice, the dragon rocks and the battle between harry and valdemort is priceless. But why I'm not very happy with this movie? Mainly because the acting of the 3 kids was awful, they were so bad that I want to die. And where the hell went their magic? the thing about this movies that was so cool is that they always are together no matter what, and in this movie they seem far away from each other, sorry Potters fans, but I got out of the theather with a leg an a arm missing, the movie doesn't delivers for me.",1
1245,5.0,"Why, oh why are people giving this film 10 out of 10????? I am confused, did they watch a different film? Surely anyone who is a fan of the book could not give it 10, purely because of the amount left out. I concede that the content that was there did the book justice, but so many of the sub-plots that made the book interesting were non-existent.",0
1246,,"This is by far the most embarrassing installment of the harry potter films, not that I enjoyed any of the others. What really annoys me about this film, and I mean REALLY annoys me is the completely wooden performances by the lead characters, and how Daniel Radcliffe has become the UK's most valuable teenager is beyond me. Stirred up by the success of the books, these films are riding purely on the parental pester power from pre teens alone, and the release of these films is such an allegedly major event that parents feel they can't deny their kids. What is also obvious from watching this film, ( well when I say watching, i mean catching the film between me falling asleep in the cinema), is that the director is packing to much CGI and action into the film when it isn't needed. What happened to the directors of films such as Run Lola Run and Lord of the rings, who use their obvious talent as directors rather than just budget to create a great film.",0

1248,7.0,"I just got back from seeing this film. So far, its the low point in the series. I blame this more on the fact that they tried to cram a 700+ page book into a few hours.

However, I can easily see how my fiancée, who hasn't read it yet, thought the film jumped around and felt disjointed.",1

The movie ended abruptly and certain areas never explained as in the book. I expected more of harry. But expectations never fulfilled. The boy wizard stayed as boy wizard. Not a bit of heroism. He was always afraid never seemed to be confident. Hermione was less ecstatic in this movie and her role was very much minimized. New characters have added spice to the movie with fresh talent. Too much hype was created before the movie was released. But it failed to sustain the hype. If it had been any other ordinary movie from Hollywood, i would have rated 10/10. But Rowling's Harry must have lived up to its fame and name. So i rate it 7.",0
1251,8.0,"I'll throw up my hands and confess I HAVE NEVER, EVER READ A HARRY POTTER. This placed me at an immediate disadvantage when watching this movie (though I have watched all the previous instalments with a cool, but interested eye). Nevertheless, along I went, and found myself thrilled, chilled and, er, spilled for the duration. Although the oddly speeded-up pace of the opening (the Quidditch World Cup hardly gets five minutes more than sufficient to impress an audience with awe-inspiring CG) jarred me a little, once the film had settled down and found its pace I was spellbound. The darkness is really closing in at Hogwarts, and finally a Potter movie has stopped patronising and started actually trying to be a film for adults as well as tots (who will be snivelling at the sight of the hideous, evil Voldemort, made even more sinister by Ralph Fiennes' superb turn).",1
1252,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a very good movie! It shows Harry in his fourth year of Hogwarts where he is mysteriously entered in a contest that he knows nothing about. Here in the tournament you have Harry being tested physically, mentally, and emotionally. He gets hurt a little bit when he asks Cho Chang to the Yule Ball and she turns him down, because she has a date already. Then on top of that you have fire breathing dragons, evil mermaids, and a maze that ends up with Cedric Diggory ( the other contestant from Hogwarts) dead. He was killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort after he was reborn by Wormtail(Peter Pettigrew, or the person that betrayed Harry's parents in the third installment.)Overall this movie is very good but not for the younger audience at all. With three people getting killed it is not a kid friendly movie.",1
1253,10.0,"this film is brilliant! its the best of all 4 so far!!! The action and the music just bring the magic to life!! definitely worth watching at the cinema rather than waiting for the DVD. its not exactly like the book the film is some what different. but after watching the film today its made me want to go read the book again!! go see it and experience the magic 4 yourself:)the film is put together really well and the actors cast for there individual roles portrays the characters just how you vision them in the book, characters of the film has to cederic diggory or hermione granger there outstanding. the only bad thing about the film is dumbledores dodgy changing accent!! just go see it!",1

1255,8.0,"I recently saw the Goblet of Fire and was blown away by the film. The director did an excellent job of conveying the mystery and darkness now befalling Harry onto the big screen. As for the actors themselves; it was their best showing yet. I was especially pleased by Emma Watson's performance. She has noticeably matured as an actress since the last film. I have not even mentioned the most stunning part of the film. The special effects were magnificent. I caught myself with my jaw hanging five or six times throughout the movie in awe of how masterfully the ideas from the book were brought to life. If you're a Potter fan, this is a must see.",1
1256,7.0,"Okay, first of all, I'd just like to say that I really liked this movie even though I rate it seven stars. I rate it that because Voldemort had no hood on and he was barefoot.Plus he didn't have red eyes and he looked like some regular guy with makeup on. I also rate it seven stars because I think it should be rated PG! My cousin told me the graveyard scene was scary. ",1

Now I haven't read the book, but the opening 10 minutes was totally unnecessary. With that extra time they could have shown all of the dragon tasks. Hated how the movie felt like a few days rather than an entire school year, like the other movies did. Wish Hagrid and Hermionie would have had a larger role too. Liked the flirtation and frustration Hermionie showed towards Ron.",0

I am sure we will purchase the DVD when it is released, but it will only be to complete the series.",1

1262,5.0,"Let me first start out by saying Book 4 is my favorite so far from the series. I was extremely excited, yet scared about what they were going to do to the book when adapted for the screen. Well let's just say all of my fears came true. I gave it a five only because the movie if standing alone is good to watch, but from a fan's standpoint (being compared to the book) is horribly saddening. I know it's a huge book and there is a lot of information in it, but there was so much that they could take out of the movie and replace it with more story and character building time. Examples (spoilers): In the beginning what is Barty Crouch doing there with Lord Voldemort and Wormtail (that's supposed to be secret till the end), and why weren't the Weasley's and Harry (where was Bill) in the Minister's box at the World Cup?? This made the Weasleys look unimportant. At the World Cup that's where they should have put in moreaction, instead the scene is gone in like 60 seconds, they are all celebrating and then boom the Death Eater scene which was CHEESY!!!! No muggles were tortured in this scene, which I feel shows you the true intensity of the Death Eaters. Next we are on our way to Hogwarts and so are the Durmstrangs and Beauxbatons. Now I can understand why they rushed this part. Let's get to the fun stuff. More Blah, Blah, Blah... The Tri-wizard Tournament was way off base from the true text, the whole fight with the dragon was way tooooo stretched out (where's Charlie Weasley?)and the fight with the Grindylows was not at the end of the second task, but in the beginning. I felt the director was trying too hard to make the scenes intense, but there was no need you were already on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens to Harry. The third task is the most disappointing-they were supposed to test their knowledge and skills, not run around and try not to get sucked in by the maze bushes. The Voldemort re-birthing was okay, but that's where they should have extended a scene. VOLDEMORT IS BACK, hello this should be the most intense part of the movie. The whole movie is built up around this ending and all I am saying is, that's it???? Ralph Fiennes is a wonderful actor and I expected a lot more from him. The make up sucked, you could tell it was him. Voldemort shouldn't have a cuteness to him. My last complaint is the end-wait a minute was there an ending-do not know because it was rushed by sooo fast I wouldn't be able to tell you what happened unless I had read the book. I loved the first two Harry Potter films, that is what got me hooked on the books and becoming a fan. The films stayed true to the books, even though people think that they were childish-they were and so were the books. I became disappointed with the third movie. It begins a series of omissions that made the books. Yes these books are long, but if adapted correctly Harry's story will be told just as it is in the books. Plus I believe that true fans will stay and see a long movie....The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was long and stayed true to the books, even though there were story lines omitted it did not affect the heart of the book. I think it's time for a new screenplay writer (Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens anybody??), it needs fresh blood. Also is there a reason J.K. Rowling is letting her books be butchered?? The director Mike Newell was good, better than Alfonso, but there was just a lot missing. Okay I could go on forever, but here it is in a nutshell. Go and see the movie you will enjoy it, but if you are a fan of the book set everything you know about it aside, because well you will be disappointed. I am looking forward to book number 5, hoping they will do it justice and make a long movie with a true storyline.",1
1263,9.0,"Although its one of the least accurate to the books, second to half blood prince, the cinematics of this film are perfect. it really captures the magic and the fear of the dark lord in perfect balance.",1
1264,3.0,"This was definitely not an HP standard film. At least the others followed the books somewhat closely. This was way off. For example, in Order of the phoenix, Dumbledore says to Umbridge: ""I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores."" Yet in this movie he is quite happy to manhandle Harry himself. They completely changed the scene with the dragon. Since when did Harry have a mad scrabble across the castle roof trying to escape the Horntail? They ruined the maze as well. Hedges that grow evil roots and smash together? Please. I wasn't too happy wit the portrayal of Mad-Eye Mody, either. He didn't make me think of the portrayal of Moody in the books. He wasn't battle scarred or missing half a nose. And a metal shoe for a foot replacement? Where is the famous clawed wooden foot I have come to recognize? Where are the skrewts? Do we ever see Rita in her beetle form? There are so many things wrong here I couldn't list them all on a twelve foot sheet of paper, using the tiniest print possible.",1

There were many mistakes/goofs in the movies that, believe me, are nearly impossible to notice, and it seemed far too short.

1266,8.0,Wow! Got to see the movie on 11/14/05. It has by far been the best Potter movie to date. It's really neat to see these kids grow up right in front of you. The performances of all the main actors only get better with time as do the special effects. Although the film carries a PG-13 rating I would recommend not taking children under age 8. Reason being that some of the more frightening moments in the movie would absolutely scare a child. If you read the book you will know what I mean. There are heavier dark forces at work here so hence the scarier scenes but done very tastefully. Oh yea don't forget the movie is almost 3 hours long.,1
1267,,"I didn't start enjoying the Harry Potter series until movie three came out . The first two movies were good, but not fantastic. The third movie was the first one in the series to be fantastic. Azkaban set the bar for the next movies in the series to be amazing and that's what the Goblet of Fire is; it's amazing. The suspense and fear you feel for Harry when watching him preform the three tasks captures the mood of the novel perfectly. Also, the final scene with Harry in the graveyard is by far the best ending scene in any Harry Potter movie to date. The actors are maturing along with the movies and I can't wait to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix after watching this. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a perfect score would have to be the Yule Ball scene (drags on a tad too long). Other than that, Go Harry!",1

(to say the least) but overall i was fascinated and i'm all excited about the next film - Order of the Phoenix. Daniel Radcliffe was again amazing!!!!!!!! unbelievable. my favourite scene was the dragon scene i loved it to pieces!!!!!!! legend film and Daniel Radcliffe - what a fit hot guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love him so much. i mean i am so harry potter's number 1 fan!!!!!!!! they've been great and i don't want them to stop. i was very sad and on the verge of tears when Cedric died and even more so when his dad started crying - that was awful. love you Dan Radcliffe and the gang you were magnificent!!!!!",1

They also have amazing digital and CG effects. Perhaps the best things about HP films is that each one seems more amazing than the next, and the films have the same magical lustre as the novels, despite minor plot trimming.",1

1271,,"One thing that I really enjoy about the Harry Potter series is the fact that even though the movies are set up in a fantasy like world, the characters develop a sense of growing up. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the characters develop teenage habits and start become attracted to other people. Much like real people in our world. So even though the series is fantasy like, the audience still gets characters that they can relate to. The characters developing into adulthood is not only thing that develops in this movie. As suggested by it's ""PG-13"" rating, the movie is more dark, frightening, scary, and violent. I mean, maybe Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire isn't the worst ""PG-13"", but some smaller viewers might not be able to handle or understand the developments in this new entry. The movie opens with Harry having a bad dream in which an old man is murdered by a figure that is completely unrecognizable (his body is blocked by a chair anyway). Harry, Ron, and Hermione then continue a new year at Hogwarts were the Tri Wizard Tournaments are being held. The Tri Wizard Tournaments is were champion students from every magical school compete for the Tri Wizard cup. Only if a student is seventeen and is chosen from the Goblet of Fire, can they compete in the tournament. Oddly Harry is chosen from it and is made fun of by all the schools (and his) for cheating the Goblet of Fire. Even though Harry doesn't want to, he now must compete with the contestants Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, and Viktor Krum in dangerous events including dragons, a maze that closes from the end up, and weird fish like creatures (not so dangerous actually). However, as the Tri Wizard competition progresses, odd events happen that link in the end to Lord Voldemort's full return. For me, it wasn't the graphics or the plot or directing that made me so happy about this film. Like I said, the thing that made me most happy was that characters were so easy to relate to because they developed into what real teenagers would be like. Even look closely at the characters. Harry develops an attraction for a girl, Hermione develops into a beautiful young girl (attrating Viktor Krum), and Ron spawns a form of jealousy over Hermione. Maybe this may not be one of the most important key elements in the film, but I think it was pretty important. Overall: A- ",0

1273,10.0,"I am a fan of the books and for me this movie was a bit disappointing in some parts. First the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was a terrible decision. Especially the scene after Harry is selected as the fourth Triwizard champion is badly done, when Dumbledore walks in, he does not handle the situation calmly and carefully as in the book, in the movie he seems rash and by shaking and shouting at Harry he makes the situation seem far from the one portrayed in the book. Richard Harris was much better in the role of Dumbledore, when he was in a scene you knew that this is a very wise and cautious wizard with a calm and majestic presence as is portrayed in the books. Apart from the change in actors, Dumbledore's wardrobe seems to have also gone downhill from the second movie, in Goblet of Fire just like in the Prisoner of Azkaban Dumbledore looks like he is dressed in rags compared to the robes Richard Harris was wearing in the first two movies. Another badly done part of the movie was the maze. For those who have not read the books the maze probably looked amazing and I agree it had some good special effects nonetheless compared with the book it was a bit boring. The maze was meant to test different abilities of the champions, like the sphinx Harry had to overcome in the book or the upside-down charm. The maze in the movie had none of these elements and I think this was one part that could have definitely been improved with some work. Despite its flaws Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire had some spectacular special effects, I especially liked the Dragon scene, it also had a good flow and it was never boring. The Yule Ball scenes were also excellent. Maybe someday someone will take on the task to create a Harry Potter Series which will follow the books 100%, I am sure there are a lot of Harry Potter fans out there that would like to see the things they read about to come to life. I would highly recommend everyone to go and see this movie, however my advice is to first read the books and create your own ideas of what it should look like before seeing someone else's images on the screen.",0
1274,6.0,"I'm probably one of the few people on this planet that's not bothered to read the telephone books posing as fantasy novels.

1275,10.0,"The very, VERY best movie made of the Harry Potter books. My favourite book was No.3, but I didn't think the movie of that one was nearly as good. However this one has exceeded all my expectations. Although I enjoyed the book, I did think it could have done with some decent editing as there was a lot in it which didn't really add to the story. The movie has pared the book down to the actual storyline and as such it's made SUCH an improvement. And although it is quite long, you don't notice the time passing because there are always things happening. The CGI and special effects are absolutely wonderful. It left me quite in awe (a bit like LotR) at the type of things that they can do these days in movies. I laughed, I cried, I loved! If you haven't seen this movie yet, go - NOW! Oh, and it's a must see on the BIG screen.",1

1277,8.0,"This Harry Potter was maybe my second or third favorite movie and my second favorite book. The tasks are a little rushed, like the dragon task and the maze task. I think our main wizards are starting to peak in puberty, when they start, you know, like-liking other wizards in the movie. Ron likes Fleur, one of the Beaubatons students, Hermione kinda, sorta likes Viktor Krum, but the movie doesn't make it obvious. And last, Harry likes Cho, who rejects his offer to the Yule Ball, and the camera is pointing at her for quite a bit of the film. The Yule Ball is not what I expected and the movie down-sized it a lot from the book. I especially liked the part of this scene when Fred(or is it George?) threw the paper wad at Angelina to ask her to the Ball. But those two had really long hair. But, I may be the only one thinking this, Cedric Diggory, played by Robert Pattinson(EEP!!)was so massively HOT. His looks in this movie were 100 times better, because he actually looked like he had blood inside his body. But overall, this movie was and 7 and a half stars, which rounds to 8. thanks bye",1
1278,8.0,"Dumbledore's death in book six may be open to debate, but there is no doubt that he was brutally murdered in movie 4. I'm not quite sure whom Mr.Gambon was portraying but it was not the serene and profoundly wise character Albus Dumbledore (and I would be lying if I didn't say I found that more than a little distracting). Couple this with the abbreviated portrayal of the World Cup and you have my two biggest complaints about this movie. Did I miss the Dursleys, Weasleys and Sirius? To be sure. Would I have preferred more details? Absolutely. But I felt this movie managed to hold its ground despite the changes made. And in all honesty (despite all the fuss) there were certain things that really should have been left out; Winky and S.P.E.W. being at the top of the list. It is hard to imagine, even with two separate movies and a total of four hours, how you could explain a race of people who enjoy servitude, don't want freedom, and become angry or fearful with anyone who tries to help them achieve it (even one of their own). I barely grasp this concept within the confines of the 734 page storyline. Suffice it to say that including Winky (a modern day throwback to Prissy from Gone with the Wind) could only be described as celluloid suicide in this day and age(think Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars fame). In this case Mr Newell made the right decision and should be congratulated for doing so. Some things REALLY are best left to the printed page.",0

Movie number 3 and then I really started to feel that I was on a fast moving train. Now, Harry and the Goblet of Fire is a lightning bolt! Best movie of the series so far.

I have read the book several times, but still wants to see the happenings on the big screen How Lord Voldemort stops Harry from getting the Triwizard cup How someone gets killed (can't reveal the name - guidelines) .what happens to Hermione, how will she find her date in the Competition, what about Harry's infatuation, will he find someone good? What happens to Ron? All these questions are haunting  I really perceive this movie as an occurrence that excites the senses. A phenomenon!

1282,1.0,"I planned on spending a night of my Thanksgiving break home from college watching one of my favorite books be put to the screen. Instead of seeing a book portrayed as a movie, I saw a movie portrayed as a Sparknotes guide. It touched most of the scenes in the book, but it put many out of order, and for those that were put in the correct order, they simply didn't flow and had poor connecting transitions. I felt that this movie to portray highlights from the book rather than being the book itself. The worst part about it is how bad Dumbledore was portrayed. He did not match the loving sage that Richard Harris gave us and that J.K. Rowling describes him as. Also, the whole rise of the dark lord was skewed, and it should have been one of the covert themes of the movie, but it didn't become what was the main point of the book until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Overall, I had to explain to many people why things happened when the movie should have depicted it better.",0
1283,8.0,"I read the book and I didn't think it was one of the best books. But this movie definitely is the best so far. Its close to the book but they have left parts out, which are I suppose for the better. No one really wants to watch another quiditch match when they know how the winner will be. I watched it at the weekend with my girlfriend and we both loved it. We talked about it for ages afterwards(Sad). There is a lot to talk about. The movie is long, but its one that you actually want to sit though. But yeah the acting of the 3 main actors has improved. The visual effects in this movie are stunning. And there are genuine funny bits in this movie. The newer spells are really cool. I give this movie 10/10. It really does deserve it. Go and see it now!!!",1
1284,9.0,"Supplanted Prisoner of Azkaban as the best in the series. These movies just keep getting better. Just hope they can finish the series before the actors and actresses grow too old and we end up with a 25 year old Harry playing a 17 year old high school kid. Great work from beginning to end. Only gripes may have been with some of the special effects being somewhat forced. Hermoine has definitely come into her own, going from an effective supporting character to a excellent leading woman. Ron continues to play the bumbling side kick, but the interaction between he and Harry in this one just didn't seem real. Overall, the supporting characters, teachers, villains all add to an overall fantastic journey in the world of Harry Potter.",1

Unexpectedly, Harry gets chosen to compete there, even though he is too young. He goes out on the missions, and it is very interesting to watch his progress during the movie.",1

The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far!

I actually wanted to leave after the first half hour...I was bored - BORED! With Harry Potter! I LOVE Harry Potter, and this one was awful in comparison to the other three. I went to this movie with the expectation of being mystified and taken aback by the wondrous magical things in this world in which everyone, child or adult, likes to get sucked into for a couple hours and pretend that they are a part of. It's such a fantastical world. Well, the only magical thing in this movie is that they had their wands out a couple of times, I think. That was about it. Everything else was just the magic of the bad evil powers coming after them...no mysticism or awe to it...just the bad guys around every turn. In short, it was an action movie - sexual innuendos included - with a slight magical twist.",0

First of all, the whole thing seemed rushed, although it was better than the previous ones, but there was still something about it that seemed like they were trying to get through it all in time. This also made it seem like it took place in a really short amount of time, much less than a year. But if that was the case? Why did they have so many extra bits? Like the graveyard dream? Or the AWFUL scene where the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang people came into the hall, or the whole flying all over Hogwarts fighting the badly done dragon scene. And they cut so many good parts, like Rita being an Animagus. Plus, they seemed to want to save money by cutting Dobby, the Dursleys, and Mrs. Weasley from the movie Another thing was the LOTR-esquire scene with the music and everything. Oh, and the hero- ifying harry. JK Rowling does that enough in the books. Like having Harry be the only witness to the dark mark? It just seems like they're making him into an even more wonderful, wildly talented saintly person then he really is. Having said all that, I really liked Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, and I adored Ron and the Weasley twins (of course). And this was, hands down, the best HP movie, which says a lot about the other three (what I thought of them, anyway).",0

And the dragon seen was totally SO not in the book! There are main characters missing (Charles & Bill Weasley) and they had made Hermione Granger looked as-if she is boy crazy!! Oh, and Fleur Delacour was a blond! Wasn't she suppose to be part Veela? Where is the silver hair? And if you think you don't see enough of Hermione (about total of 10-15 minutes of screen time), then you will see a lot less of Ron! Or anyone else for that matter! Should I continue??

1298,3.0,"After the fantastic adaptations of the previous books, Goblet of Fire was a huge disappointment. So many subplots and characters were left out that what remained had huge holes in it, ideas dangling, vital events chopped to nothing or a teaser at best: such as the Quidditch Cup and the DeathEaters march while torturing the Muggles above their heads, etc. It was unsatisfying and I wish they had stuck with the original plan of a 2-part movie to better capture the genius and style of Rowling's series. I missed seeing the tiff between Hagrid and Madame Maxime over his suggestion that she might be part-giant, and you couldn't really grasp the extent of Harry's isolation from everyone, including his closest friends, that year. As he is getting older and closer to fulfilling the prophecy, things are getting harder, darker, and more lonely, and being a teenager sucks. On the upside, the Horntail scrabbling across the minarets of Hogwarts after Harry and the scene in the graveyard with Voldemort were fantastic. The scenes of talking to Sirius in the fireplace and finding out the truth about Mad-Eye Moody really reminded me of the book and were effective.",1
1299,9.0,"As many Harry Potter fans do, I have mixed feelings about Mike Newell's 'The Gobelt of Fire'. I will therefore list my view on the pros and cons; _Pros *Neville's character was enhanced in this film by some brilliant acting from Matthew Lewis; we see some real depth from his character that I thought wouldn't be shown until the fifth installment. *Daniel Radcliffe's performance; anyone who ever doubted this guy's acting range and crying abilities will be blown away...very blown away. The scene where Harry is crying over Cedric's dead body is done incredibly well, a strong improvement from Harry's infamous crying scene in 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. Radcliffe is no longer the reactive, wide-eyed kid we knew; he now IS Harry Potter. *Rupert Grint's acting abilities were strengthened in this one as well; he gives a lot of depth to Ron in the scenes where Ron is jealous and angry at Harry. he proves that he can be funny as well as dramatic. *The fact that the characters really are all teenagers; and still in awe of the fantastic wizarding world. *Brendon Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody-he's a scene stealer. He totally owned the role, and gave a wonderful rich portrayal, making the transition from 'Mad Eye' to Barty Crouch Jr. very smooth. *The special effects were much better than I expected; they will NOT fail to impress. The Quidditch World Cup, the dragon scene, the second task were all stunning eye candy. *The leaving out of potentially awkward scenes, such as S.P.E.W and Winky. I personally thought that the earlier Dobby scenes and other creature scenes such as the Biting Books were awkward and distracting. This film was more mature and focused. *This movie does lack the artistic rich tone and style that Alfonso Cuaron brought to 'Azkaban'. However, I still think that 'Goblet' is the best film yet. -The Cons *This film feels incredibly rushed, even to readers of the books such as myself. It could have been handled more smoothly I think. *Characters like Frank and Cedric were undermined and watered-down. You end up having no sympathy for either character when they are killed, especially Cedric. Instead of the polite; humble gentleman that the book Cedric is, the movie Cedric is cocky and shallow. His character is hardly shown with Harry or Cho, leaving a hollow awkward feeling when he dies. There is no touching on the tension between him and Harry about their struggle for Cho and the Triwizard Cup, yet their strange bond. Their relationship was portrayed disappointingly, saved only by Radcliffe's magnificent crying scene. *Emma Watson's acting. I think she's putting too much of herself in this role. There is too much snorting before and after her lines, and when she reacts she gets an glare. Too much over-acting here. In 'Prisoner' she did a fair job, but I have yet to see her act to the standards she did in 'Sorceror's Stone'. Hermione's character was saved only by the Yule Ball scenes and the Avada Kedavra classroom scene. *Too much Harry/Hermione and not enough Harry/Ron. While we all acknowledge Radcliffe's and Watson's chemistry, it is important to remember that Harry and Ron's relationship is so much stronger than that portrayed in the films, which is a shame. *Finally, those classic bits which all Potter fans wanted in that got out, such as the Weasleys/Dursleys, Rita Skeeter as a beetle, the weighing of the wands, and the explanation of the Veela.",1
1300,10.0,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is without a doubt the most exciting book of the entire series, and Mike Newell's film adaptation certainly does it justice. Maybe it's because I'm biased (after all, it's my favorite book), but not to sickly exaggerate, it seemed to do so much more than parallel the book in adventure and detail, that it was hard to blink or find the motivation to reach for the popcorn. Being a mere two-and-a-half hours, there were obviously some parts that were cut, such as much of the Quidditch World Cup, S.P.E.W. (including Dobby and Winky), Hagrid's and Madame Maxime's story and Rita Skeeter being an Animagus, but it would've unnecessarily slowed the dramatic pace the rest of the movie was going. The acting, in general, was marvelous, especially the main trio, Moody, and the Weasleys. The marginal exceptions were Dumbledore, and ... dare I say it, Lord Voldemort, although that might be a bit harsh on Michael Gambon and Ralph Fiennes. Yet the normality of Voldemort and the dullness of Dumbledore still slightly dampened the superbly written ending; but all in all, this film is definitely worth waiting hours in line for.

That was the scene where Harry's name is shot from the Goblet of Fire. In that scene, Albus Dumbledore catches the piece of paper and says Harry's name, but then he yells it as if he is angry with Harry. And, though he might be, I feel this scene contradicts the personality that J.K. Rowling has created for Dumbledore. Not once in any of the books released so far has Dumbledore ever raised his voice to anyone. Even in the fifth book when Harry is rampaging his office after Sirius's death, Dumbldore does not yell. I found it a bit disturbing when the character I had come to know through reading the books took such a drastic change in the movie. Dumbledore has always been described has having patience, and even Harry gets upset with how calm he can be.",1

I resent losing the last chance to see Quidditch...and championship level at that! Please calm down Our Hermione! She is too shrill and you are losing her character. I've read the books repeatedly and listen to the audio-books weekly. (""Thank God for Jim Dale!"" Listening to him perform these books, I feel that I've seen the movie already!) I need to see Sirius! Gary Oldman is an impeccable actor and this character is sorely needed. Besides, you need to develop Harry. It would have been better theater for Moody to perform the two Unforgivable Curses on the spiders but do the Imperious Curse on the students so we could see Harry fight it and throw it off! It's in the book and he is a great wizard, you know! Please get some focus about these films. Are you trying to honor the story or just using the thinnest veneer to make money? Haven't you realized you will make the money...just give the story a fair treatment. I sure hope people who didn't read the book understand Priori Incantantum! Besides, it was boring to watch that dragon flying all over Hogwarts which Dumbledore wouldn't have allowed anyway! The champions are being protected, you know.

1305,5.0,"To start, I will admit I am a bit of a purist. This harry potty movie is very thin, and loosely based on the book. The movie seriously lacks any dialog, character development, or for that matter, plot matter that was originally in the book. Just about the only plots that weren't chopped out were the tri-wizard tournament and Harry's confrontation with Voldemort. Virtually everything else was eliminated or changed to fit this hacked rendition. Even the tournament lacked the essence portrayed in the book, as if it were just another everyday event in the life of Hogwarts. Several characters are missing, and character personalities are changed to fit the new story. If you are looking for a movie about the original story, this movie isn't it. If you are just looking for another blah action thriller with poor acting, zero dialog, and very little point, this is your movie.",0

I always thought they picked all the wrong actors, the child characters became chartoonish and slapstick, and the screenplay is some of the hokiest, most clichéd stuff written (Especially the first film).

1310,6.0,"I have to say first of all that I am a die-hard fan of the books, I own them all (as well as all the movies on DVD). I started out watching the movies and then began reading the books after I saw Prisoner of Azkaban. I don't know if it is because this is the first time I have ever seen a movie after I have read the book or not but I was truly disappointed in the film. I keep reading about how everyone is so impressed with the screenplay and adaptation of the book and I think they are totally wrong. I know that everything is totally different in the story from this book on but the movie and the book took totally opposite directions. There was no character development, the film focused solely on the Tri-Wizard tournament and the return of Voldemort. Not that these things aren't important but they don't matter if they are the only things happening in the movie. We should have been told about Barty's son and his whole story when he was captured. As well as dozens of other sub plots that were just ripped out of the story. What about the Quidditch World Cup? And Winkey the house elf? And Neville didn't give Harry the gilly-weed, Dobby did. This movie left so much to be desired. I hope that Order of the Phoenix is done better or they get a different director or screen writer. If anyone out there agrees with me please let me know because I feel like I am the only one that feels this way.",1
1311,10.0,"All the Harry Potter movies are very good, but this is by far my favorite. The acting was as great as it has always been, the special effects were brilliant, and all the tasks were done very well. One of the major improvements I found was the humor. ""Goblet of Fire"" is funnier then the first three movies put together. The fourth movie is also more mature then the first three, as is the book. It's interesting, not to mention hilarious, to watch the characters turn from children into young adults. Daniel Radcliffe has given his fourth outstanding performance, and has also become a great deal more mature himself. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" deserves four stars and 10 out of 10 points! It was an absolutely brilliant movie!",1
1312,10.0,"This movie was so incredible it is hard to even know where to start. First the adaptation of this book was so wonderfully done, everything that was important or worth knowing from the book was mentioned. The actors are growing and so are their talents, making anyone fall so deeply involved with these characters. The visual effects, well spectacular is the only word that comes to mind when describing anyone of the marvelous scenes. Mermaids, dragons, enchantment all around, only some of the few wonderful things one can expect to see in this film. The suspense that exists in this film, more than any of the other films grabs at your attention through the whole movie and never lets go even to the end. The sarcasm and wit of the film stands out so much, it makes the film enjoyable for the adult as well as the child. Mike Newell kept right along with the dark theme that one saw in the previous Harry Potter film, but takes it to much greater depths. This film had every emotion ranging from humor, to fear, then jealously, and sadness, and most of all satisfaction at the terrific job done to this film. I will definitely see it a few more times because it was so far the most memorable movie I have seen all year. Well done to everyone involved with the film, and anyone who has yet to see this movie, don't wait this movie is so excellent it will have you writing a comment on it.",1
1313,8.0,"Those of us Potter book fans who were upset with the things left out of Prisoner of Azkaban had better face the fact - they are not gonna fit everything in these films! Cut out the Dursleys, Herimone's (slightly annoying) house-elf liberation plans, and a few basically unimportant characters, and there's where hardcore ""purist"" Potterites went crazy.",0
1314,4.0,I have recently started reading the books and yes I'm well aware that the movies are never as good as the book. Though I'm very disappointed in this one. The first three films did a decent job staying true to the story but when you get to this one they significantly cut back many key details to this particular book. This one was always one of my favorite in the series cause that was when I felt like the movies started getting really good. Though I am glad to have finally read the book cause there is so much that they leave out of the movie.,1
1315,9.0,"When Mike Newell, was given the option of making two films out of ""The Goblet of Fire,"" some might say he did a dangerous thing by going against it. In order to make it possible to make the one book, into one movie, the only thing he could do, was take out the bulk of the sub-plots, centralizing the movie on the main theme. A dangerous thing certainly. This was a big change, and he would face the possible risk of an angry reception, if he failed to meet the audiences expectations. But I think he did. And did wonderfully at that. It took quite a bit of courage to make the decision, to cut the book down, and Mike Newell certainly had it. But now, lets look at what made this film, so good.",0

I literally had goosebumps from the beginning till the end of the film. The 12a rating evidently implies that the trio are kids no longer and they have grown-up. It was good to see the film done by a British director for once as it is a British novel. The visual effects (especially the dragon and underwater scene), were realistic. However, I felt that the dummies used in the underwater scene looked unrealistic and nothing like the actors. I also felt that the maze scene could have been improved (i.e. in the novel, there were several magical creatures in the maze, unfortunately in the film there wasn't). The quidditch world cup proved disappointing also as it was only on for 5 minutes. I also was disappointed about the fact that some characters were either not included or had little time on the screen (i.e. Mrs Weasley, Winky and Dobby, Ludo Bagman and Sirius Black).",0

But no World Quidditch game (Except the opening and the party after wards, celebrating a victory) thats just pathetic. The Special effects are some of the best i've ever seen. But other than the dragon sequence, they are not used to there full potential. The maze sequence should of been intense but comes out seeming lame, Run away from the attacking plants? lame. While in the book there were fantastic creatures harry had to face in the maze, none were found in the movie version.As said before, this movie is average at best. WB seems to not have been able to find a balance between these movies being entertaining as well as sticking close to the material. Movies one and two were close to the material but boring, movies three and four were entertaining but no where near the original books. Plus they REALLY NEED A NEW DUMBLEDORE. I know that Michael Gambon is one of the greats but he does not make his representation of harry's fatherly figure very, well, fatherly. there is basically no difference between Dumbledores representation, and Snapes. So they need a better Dumbledore.",0

The only thing that bother me is that the character of Dumbledore is odd and aggressive, which is very hard to really process, Dumbledore in first two films is completely different and guess what I liked and found him more convincing, not this angry Dumbledore, I have no clue why he portrayed that way. Still movie war on par with Chamber of Secrets, at least for me who haven't read the books.",0
1325,5.0,"I've never bothered to read the book and I guess that might be why I didn't get a single part of the movie. The movie was way too fast paced for the viewer to catch up. Hardly any characterization in this movie, and the magical touch to the first 3 films was just lost in this one. Every time I started to understand something, something else happens. I was also quite dissatisfied with this dumbledore, no longer so wise and powerful-looking as he was, acting quite annoying actually. No more dursleys, no more train to hogwarts, like how they started off with in the last 3 movies, probably wasn't in the book, but just creates that gap that viewers need to connect to the characters. Not enough classroom scenes. Too many new characters introduced in this fast paced film. Neville Longbottom has gotten way too skinny to be the troublesome pesk he was. the film was so fast, cho chang just didn't fit into the movie, harry's crush on her was too sudden, leaving the viewer confused at parts. (Not to mention she's not as pretty as she was in the book.) Overall film too choppy and fast paced, and not enough connection with the viewer, or with the last 3 films.",0
1326,3.0,"This is my favorite book. The book has so much detail, so many stories within the main story and so much excitement that defines the main story and next books. Sad to say that they include in the movie maybe half of the book and another person on this site said it best when they where upset about this movie not being two movies. If they did not want two movies go for just one long great tale of a movie. I sat through 4hours of Lord of The Rings and did not want it to end. So no matter what I say the bottom line is it is no comparison to the book and it makes a cheesy love/ adventure movie about a fairy tale world. Read the book and watch the movie only to see what they think the details look like (even though they didn't go by a lot of the books details). Keep in mind no great book can ever be turned into a great movie.",1

1330,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantastic film for any age at all. It has comedy, action, and a great storyline. This film is a must see. We start off with Voldemort himself, but not really AS himself. This particular volume of the series is about his return, and the addition to some very vital characters. The basic plot is that after an odd mishap in a tournament of the wizard world, Harry must endure himself in three very hard and mature tasks.",1
1331,4.0,"Adapting such a large book into one movie must have been difficult, but I think it could have been much better. The Tournament and Harry and Ron fighting pretty much filled the entire movie. Narrative structure was missing; I would never anticipate or understand the ending if I hadn't read the books. Also a lot of weird directorial decisions; some shots were so dark it was difficult to tell which character was which. Also confusing was why every scene with Hermione and Harry seemed shot to make it seem like Hermione is in love with Harry, which readers should dispute. I was also confused by some sexual comments, which are not part of the book. Hogwarts seemed more like a high school with magic wands than a wizarding school. Overall I was disappointed by how much of the story was missing and more by how the spirit of the story was missing.",0

I was surprised by all the negative reviews on here. Whenever you watch a movie that's based on a book, you need to remember two things. 1. This is a movie that's based on a book. 2. This is not the book, it's a movie, so enjoy it for what it is, not everything it's not.

It's just that, in order to cram that big book into a Hollywood time frame, too much had to be dropped. Moreover, the background scenes in the beginning had a choppy look to them--it almost felt like they were going through with a razor blade and shaving off frames at the end of it to make their time. The overall effect was far too choppy to quite enjoy as much as I have the last few. Even the climactic scenes just felt like they never quite resolved. The director should have just split them up into two movies like he was originally intending. Besides, that way they'd make twice as much money.",0

In my opinion it was the most suspenseful and throughout the story it was full of action, romance, humor, suspense and MOST IMPORTANTLY a mystery. Yes the best part about the story is the mystery surrounding the man who put Harry's name into the Goblet and what the motivations were behind it.

My favourite scenes were when Harry is selected for the tournament , the Maze the Underater scenes etc,even at 41 I found some parts of the film quite scary . Best of luck to David Yates who's directing the Order of the Phoenix , but this will be a tough act to follow.",1

I would recommend these movies and books for most age groups, though not the very young (under 10) as they are a bit intense and get more so as the books go on, the battle between the dark or evil and the light or good has always been a serious one that gets quite gritty as it goes on... this series is no example.",1
1349,10.0,"There is a saying that the books are always better than the films based on these books. I beg to differ. Only a few years ago, around the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", I got caught in the magic created by an amazing woman, J.K.Rowling. I wanted to read the book first before seeing the story on screen. After that, I knew I would be addicted for the rest of my life, though never experienced anything like that before. I suppose Lord of the Ring fans know what I'm talking about. I've read all the books, several times, seen all the films, several times, and just can't get enough of this wizard and his friends. Is there a difference between the books and the films? Of course, since these are two totally different media. It's almost impossible to film the whole book and therefore necessary to leave certain details out. The authenticity is however, thanks to the author herself, because of this, remarkable. If the first three were jewels, this one is a diamond. And diamonds are this girl's best friend. The film is a roller-coaster ride filled with excitement, humor (thank you Weasleys), tension, amazing acting performances, friendship, terror and even romance. If I had to describe the film in one word, it would be impossible. Although ""magical"" kind of sums it up.",1
1350,9.0,"This was the best Harry Potter movie so far (however not by much as the first two movies were also great). Daniel Radcliff certainly has developed as an actor. While in the third movie he was completely unsure of himself, in this movie he is certainly holding his own against some of the best Brits in the business not to mention Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, both of whom are excellent. The story adaptation is best that it could be, given the sheer complexity of the book. The special effects are great. The only thing that I could find wrong with the movie is Micheal Gambon's acting. I think he has Dumbledore completely wrong. He screams and yells and acts bewildered where the word that I would associate with Dumbledore is ""calm."" Richard Harris had Dumbledore down cold and I wish Micheal Gambon could learn a little from his example.",1
1351,8.0,"I give it 10 not because it's one of the greatest movies of all time but more cause it's the best out of four. I really didn't imagine before that this fourth movie will be this dark. The maze and the graveyard scenes are amazing. It's dark, thrilled, and stunning. It's not the same as I imagined but it's way better. I love it. It's true that it doesn't show the wondrous wizard world. It's more to the main story, the Triwizard Tournament. But it doesn't disappoint me cause I'm afraid it will be boring instead. But maybe if Mike Newell could just show the Quidditch Cup a little more and Harry-Sirius interactions (which is very important cause we all know what will happen on the fifth). It's two and a half hours. I don't mind if it's three. Lots said that Daniel Radcliffe has improved much, and I agree. It's very comfortable seeing his acting. Rupert Grint shows the same old Ron. Emma Watson is the problem. Both Dan and Rupert act in a comfort way, but Emma seems so tense. And that makes their acting looks imbalance and uncomforted, especially when they appear at the same scene. I think Emma gives too much energy. While the other casts, well.. I must say that no wonder Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors. He's so great. He's a perfect Voldemort. Both his movement and voice stunned me, though he appears only a few minutes. Brian Gleeson is also great. But I'm a little disappoint 'bout Madame Maxime. I imagined she has the appearance sort of Hagrid. Cause I believe in the book it said she's big not tall. And Michael Gambon as Dumbledore.. I'm sorry but I still love Richard Harris. The cold war between Harry and Ron is shown different than the book. Rather than showing Ron's sad and jealousy, it's more to comedy (in a good way). To me, Harry and Ron look like a couple who had a fight. It's very hilarious. The other exciting thing is Fred and George. They didn't appear much on the last three movies. But here, they did a big contribution making audiences laugh. Despite my great enjoyment of this film, I have one question. How did Barty Crouch Junior escaped from Azkaban? Is it dementor who help him? The film doesn't explain it, probably they forgot. Well anyway, I still love it and I hope the fifth movie can fill the missing holes.",1
1352,8.0,"From beginning to end, I felt that the production team did an excellent job. It was all almost exactly as I imagined it when I read the book. From the beginning when Voldemort murders Frank, I felt immersed in the story all over again, as I did when I first read the book.",1
1353,8.0,I had pretty high hopes for the new potter film after the success of prisoner of azkabam so it was probably never gonna live up to expectations. It came pretty dam close but there were still some lingering problems.,1
1354,8.0,"I had heard from many fans that this was the best of the series so far. After seeing it, I have to agree with them. It is definitely the best movie so far in the Potter series. The action scenes are well choreographed and the computer-generated imaging doesn't take away from the story or the effect. Radcliffe is starting to mature as an actor, though he still has some room to improve. Unfortunately there are a few points from keeping the film from being 'great'. Michael Gambon simply doesn't embody the spirit of Albus Dumbledore the way Richard Harris did. Emma Watson is a bit melodramatic in this film...it appears more like she's acting in a school play than an international blockbuster film. Lastly, (and this was very difficult to put my finger on for quite some time) since the movie was scored by Patrick Doyle (and not John Williams) it just isn't as strong. This movie is definitely a must-see for genre fans and movie fans in general. If the Potter franchise can work with Gambon and Watson and improve the musical score...the next installment 'Order of the Phoenix' might achieve the greatness that 'Goblet of Fire' just missed.",1
1355,9.0,"Finally, The fourth Movie! In a word, it was awesome! True, it omitted much of the sub plots of the book, it stuck to the story, though focusing mostly on the triwizard tournament. the special effects were good and especially in the three tasks. though they could have tried to fit in some of the creatures, monsters etc. in the maze, as of all the tasks the third one was the shortest (in film time). the confrontation scene between voldemort and harry was really great, it was the exact copy of jkr's description. and not to forget the yule ball, in which hermione looks fantastic. though i was disappointed by Dumbledore's reaction o Harry's name coming out from the goblet, that is so totally not him as described by jkr. yes, the fourth movie definitely seems to be the best so far,not perfect,but much much better than the 3rd. overall i rate it a 9 , a must watch for harry potter fans.",1
1356,4.0,"Direction of the movie is quite pathetic. It looks as if we are watching a compilation of trailers. The focus of the movie is completely missing. The sets in the movie were spectacular and the build up to the each of the three tasks was alright but the tasks themselves looked pretty ordinary. It seems that they had big plans for each of the tasks but then had to cut them short because either of the money constraint or time constraint. One of major disappointment for me was the entry of Voldemort. One would expect that such a great moment in the story should have been made to stand out and have an impact on the audience but for me it looked ordinary just as any other scene in the movie, there wasn't enough thrill in that scene. At the end of movie, i was thinking of what have i seen in last two and half hours. I can just sum it up in 4-5 sentences. I have already read the book so i knew what is happening, but i doubt if somebody who hasn't read this book would have had any clue of what's happening in the movie. It looks as if they have tried to put in little too much within a short span of time. Underwater task is the only one which has done justice to the book. The acting of the child actors has improved considerably. But the charismatic Dumbledore was missing. He looked vulnerable. He should have looked calm and composed as he is always. I would like to ask the director to take an inspiration from ""Lord of the Rings"" and make the movie with the same sense of grandeur without compromising on time and money.",0
1357,7.0,"In my opinion, this fourth installment of the series is good, but not great. What struck me as its most obvious weakness is the script. Of course, there is far too much material in the book to put it all into the movie, things had to be left out. But what is now left is nothing more than a series of highlights from the book without a proper connection, characters are not given enough screen time to develop and to really make an impression, their motivations are often left unexplained, etc.",0
1358,9.0,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Unfortunately, due to time-constraints a lot was cut from the book to the movie. However, it is still a very good result and I was extremely pleased afterwards.",1
1359,10.0,"After the last fiasco I was prepared for this, the second longest book, to be hacked about to the point of banality like Prisoner of Askaban. I needn't have worried. This was great. The young actors have improved beyond belief - clearly they are taking their opportunity seriously. The special effects are just amazing. It is not possible to choose a particular scene which is better than the rest since they are all just terrific. I did like the dragons, though, and Harry's chase with the Hungarian Horntale was spectacular. The entrance of the Beauxbatons and Darmstrang pupils was just brilliant as was the Quiddich World Cup. Of course, with a book this long and a three hour slot, some bits had to go but, unlike Prisoner of Askaban which literally 'lost the plot', Mike Newell managed the virtually impossible task of keeping the story on course. In short, its hard to pick a particularly outstanding bit as it was all outstanding. From beginning to end it bowled along at a breakneck speed and I exited the cinema three hours later wondering where the time had gone. Lets hope they get Mike back for the finale!",1
1360,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is easily my favorite film of all time. The special FX, the acting, the musicalmost everything was superb. I only had a major problem with Michael Gambon, who plays Dumbledore. His interpretation of Dumbledore is appalling; he is just a headmaster, and almost violent (like when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire), he's not the Dumbledore that Richard Harris was. If I had my way, Gambon would be sacked immediately. He actually said in an interview that he hasn't read the books, and he has no interest; he just reads the script and does what he's told; there's no interpretation. Basically, he's just in it for the money; people like that shouldn't acting, because acting is interpreting something to make it your own performance. But enough about Gambon; the rest of the movie was terrific. Patrick Doyle wrote one of the best musical scores I've ever heard. Mike Newell took Steve Kloves's screenplay and worked wonders with it; he is the first actually accomplished director this series has seen, and it shows. The FX were wonderful, good enough to rival those in King Kong. The acting was superb, ten times better than in Prisoner of Azkaban. Rupet Grint and Emma Watson were great, even better than in the first three films. Brendan Gleeson was perfect as the eccentric Mad-Eye Moody; David Tenant was excellent as Barty Crouch Jr. Alan Rickman, as Snape, was great, as always. Jason Issacs was excellent, as he always is, as Lucius Malfoy. Katie Leung was great as Cho; Miranda Richardson was hilarious as Rita Skeeter; and sadly, we see very, very little of Gary Oldman, who was great in Prisoner of Azkaban. But my favorite performances were by Timothy Spall, as Wormtail (perfect choice!), Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory (he was charming, and handsome, and it was heart breaking to see him die near the end of the film!). Daniel Radcliffe, who actually had himself cry to film the heartbreaking scene when Cedric's body is brought back to Hogwarts, was superb. His acting has improved so much over the years; he was absolutely amazing. But, as much as I loved Daniel Radcliffe's performance, the performance that stole the movie, and, in my opinion, the greatest performance by any actor, of all time, was Ralph Fiennes as the evil Lord Voldemort. The makeup and digital effects combined with Fiennes's sinister performance made the graveyard scene absolutely terrifying for me to sit through; he was better here than even in Schindler's List! If any actor deserves an Oscar for best actor, it would have to be Ralph Fiennes (unfortunately, the snobs at Hollywood fail to acknowledge true magic like the entity that is Ralph Fiennes these days). Forget about Brokeback Mountain; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best movie of the year.",1
1361,10.0,"I have watched this yesterday, finally after a long waiting :) I thought it will be a very long movie, but in fact it is only 2.5 hours. This movie is very good :) the animation is smooth and very alive, I like the part when Harry had a fight with the dragon :) really good. But Dumbledore is a bit too young and too funky I think, it made him seem not as wise as usual. Overall, this is a good movie, funny and make you laugh from the beginning till the end. Watch the part when Ron is getting shock after he asked Fleur to go with him to the bow :D:D:D very funny. Too bad the time is too short, only 2.5 hours, so many details are not exist in the movie. you got to watch this movie!",0
1362,10.0,"I didn't want to go to see the first movie with my father and my 12 year old son because I didn't think that it would interest me. I fell asleep when I took my son to the second one. But then, I bought the DVD's and I realized that this is one of the best movies series ever made. I'm 46 years old now and have seen GOF 3 times in the theater and I just bought the DVD and watched it after American Idol. The young actors in this series are absolutely superb. I can't say enough about this series except to say that Ms. Rowling is a bona-fide genius. The story lines and the action rival the Star Wars franchise. I love the books but I don't read the book until I see the movie because of the effects the movies have on my heart and my mind. Just to close, Dan, Rupert and Emma take a bow. You are all going down into movie history.",1
1363,10.0,"The first thing you have to remember before going to see this movie is that it will not even compare to the book. Technology, personal interpretation... whatever. It'll never be the same. That being said, of all the Potter movies this was probably my favorite. I was a little skeptical going into it, wondering how it was possible that GoF was such a long novel and here it was in a 2 1/2 hour movie.",0
1364,8.0,"First of all, i would like to point out that i would have enjoyed this movie so much more if i had gone to see it with someone who would've liked it too. My friend dislikes everything basically, and so she hated Harry Potter too. I have to say thank you to her though, for actually trying to last through the movie. But i don't believe i enjoyed it to the full extent because a movie is hard to enjoy when the person sitting next to you is bored. I'll be glad to see it again soon and enjoy it so much more.",1
1365,8.0,"First, I must say, that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an exceptional movie that will be enjoyed by any fan of the series. Also, it has to be understood that in a two and a half hour film, it is quite impossible to cram in the side-stories and the tiny details that made us smile in the original novel. In my personal opinion, the Harry Potter movies shouldn't just stand alone, but the viewer must have read the book as well to understand exactly what is going on. With all of that said, let me begin.",1
1366,8.0,"If you enjoyed the style of Prisoner of Azkaban, as compared to the previous two movies, then I feel that you will enjoy Goblet of Fire even more. Prisoner of Azkaban was critically acclaimed because it managed to deviate from a strict translation of the book. It took a risk by adding little jokes and extra scenes that were necessary for a movie adaptation. Goblet of Fire does this even more, and I feel the result is really quite a good fit. I am sure Newell gave the kids loads of freedom in choosing how to act our their parts, and the result is that the scenes among the students seem completely genuine, believable, and entertaining.",1
1367,10.0,"Okak, I thought the movie was absolutely fantastic! Daniel Radcliff's acting was a lot better then it has been in the past, and the tension between Ron and Hermonie was great. The thing I didn't like was that they cut Dobby, Ludo bagman, And Ron's older brother's from the movie. I realize they had to shorten it for time purposes, but if they needed to make it 3 hours, then it should have been 3 hours. It was by far the best out of the four so far. I can't wait to see how they develop the characters in the fifth movie.",1
1368,7.0,"The last two Harry Potter movies were very forgettable. They seemed to be too much of an impossible adventure as opposed to a story. They didn't follow the book very closely and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The Goblet of Fire, with a new director, seems to be a cut above the rest. Yes, the terribly awkward dialog is still there. They try to suck as many cheap laughs out of Ron Weasley and the Weasley brothers as possible, and it gets old. Harry is a terrible actor, Ron is even worse, Hermoine is way too dramatic to be considered realistic. Yes, those last second miracles are still here. Harry finds himself about to meet his certain doom and then WOOSH! Someone comes dashing in to save him at the last second. That situation seems to be reoccuring over and over in the series, but we are used to it now and have to grudgingly accept it. Despite the gaping holes, they are not as big holes as the first three movies. I really enjoyed the direction, the film came off much darker. There was more attention given to little details, and some excellent shots of scenery, etc. The graphics seemed to be much improved, although still very cheesy at times. If you didn't like the first three movies don't worry. This one still has some of the basic mistakes, but is better at the same time. You should enjoy it.",0
1369,4.0,"OK, I have not read the books. I have seen the first three films. I have no idea why everyone is saying ""this is the best yet"". I literally had to fight falling asleep during the first 2/3 of the film. Now, granted, if you are a huge Potter fan and if you just can't get enough of seeing the little darlings on the screen with no plot, dynamics or emotion, then this is the film for you. In an attempt to make the film more ""adult"" or ""real"" the first 20 minutes is filmed very very dark...darn near maddenly underexposed. Special effects and yada yada are all first class, which is what we would expect. But, hey, what about a compelling story line? That would definitely help out the effort.",0
1370,3.0,"I can't fault the devotion of the cast on this movie, but I should have waited for the DVD to go half price in the Walmart bin. The movie tried a LOTR move by cutting out everything but the main ""Harry"" moments. I could deal with that, but in the end where Harry asks about the wands, Dumbledore just says ""Well, those things happen."" No explanation, nothing. At least in the first movies there was a point where the audience could figure out what happened. This movie is clueless and pointless, leaving more questions than answers. I was shocked that the script even included the mention of the Longbottoms' demise so folks could understand a little of Neville's reaction in the Dark Arts class.",0
1371,8.0,"Ever since the age of 11, I have been a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books (Im registered on probably 20 fansites and read the books 30 times. each) and went seeing the first film with an open mind. I thought it was quite impressive with strong performances from Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson, (Hermionie) even when they had to say such squirmingly awful things ('holy cricket!') but there two things that really annoyed me- Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and the script.",1
1372,9.0,"Well, many of you are upset that they should have made two movies instead of just one. Some of you are upset that they left so much out, but you must realize people...this is a big blockbuster movie, all they want to do is make a lot of money, and make the general public happy! This movie though was by far the best out of the series...the special effects, the actors, everyone, it just made me euphorically happy. Although a lot was left out, they can't make one book into two movies because these actors would be WAY to old for the next movies. They're too old already, they'd be 50 when they're suppose to be 18. I just had one question for this movie, what was with the sexual tension between Harry and Hermione? I mean they really didn't play up Hermione and Ron in this picture...you got the idea that she was upset that Ron didn't ask her...but Hermione was really vibin' with Harry....will my dreams come true? Will harry and Hermione ever get together? Also, one more thing that was bad about the series is that Ginny is way to young. It's hard for me to see her as a lover in Harry's eyes...it's like he's being a pedophile. BUT this is just trivial matters in the series...if you want to have some fun at the movies and want to see it again, again, and again...GO SEE HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE! I would also recommend it in IMAX because it was incredible to be consumed by Harry Potter. :-D",1
1373,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an excellent film, and not just because of the vast amount of eye-candy to be had on-screen. At last the Potter-Empire has found a director that is not obsessed with his own self-image. The film is dark, given its content, but without the over-dramatic, poorly-lit, and cinematic-Xanax affect of PoA. I appreciated Kloves attempt to keep in several key-aspects of the film, even if some parts were lacking--like the entire Quidditch game from the world Cup and the Weasley twins being privy to Harry's Cup winnings. The film also skims over Rita Skeeter's role and does not, at any point, allude to her ability to spy on people in beetle form.",0
1374,7.0,"For fans of the books you will not be disappointed with gof, all of the most memorable and important moments of the book have made it into the film (although some scenes have been altered for the film which may anger purists). Unfortunately, almost everything else has been cut from the film. depending on your patience this is a good thing however as the film runs 2.5+ hours so there is already an awful lot of material here. the story is more mature than the previous (which you've probably already hear 100+ million times by now) but this is good. All of the scenes where the students struggle with the opposite sex are quite entertaining.",0
1375,5.0,"For starters, as a movie, this is easily the best of the Harry Potter movies so far. The acting has obviously improved from the first three and the scenery, breathtaking in it's own right, stayed consistent with prior movies (unlike the scenery from Chamber of Secrets to Prisoner of Azkaban). The special effects made the movie seem otherworldly yet believable and the characters had a depth that was somewhat missing in previous installments.",1
1376,7.0,"First thing i have to say is that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film by far, and the choice of Mike Newell as director has paid off, giving the movie a darker and more well knit and composed feel than the movies by Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron. But if you're a fan who's read all six books then prepare to be disappointed as the book has many elements and characters that are left out in the movie that might leave some shocked and annoyed, but is sometimes necessary in a movie adaption that was already stretched for nearly three hours. As a reader myself, i enjoyed the interesting interpretation the movie gave for the characters and some of the scenes that i had awaited eagerly to see on film, but was disappointed at the lack of involvement of some important characters in the fourth book, and the slight sensation that everything was being rushed through, the most obvious example being Barty Crouch's death left unexplained, as well as the manner in which Harry escaped from Voldemort being left unexplained too. Overall, i recommend it for both fans and interested cinema goers, and i can't wait for the next movie.",0
1377,10.0,i went to see the fourth film on the opening day at the 2.00 o clock and was completely blown away from the movie it was brilliantly acted and shows a new side to the story its filled with action thriller packed and shows the world how good magic can be it does does deserved a 12a certificate I'm 13 and bits in the film would make me jump but apart from bits from the books being missed it was a brilliant film it also shows a very sad side to the movie and there is also many funny bits to the film Daniel Radcliffe brilliantly acted the part of harry potter he has proved he deserved the part there is also a lot of new characters and you see how harry and his friends have grown since the 1st movie looking like proper teens so i would recommend every 1 to see the film to see how brilliant it actually is,1

More Sirius would have been nice however. Also this is the first well- paced movie in the franchise. Something is always happening and they have cut out the irritating scenery shots from the earlier movies. There are thankfully no gratuitous shots of Harry and Hedwig. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all play their parts well to the extent that Watson's over- enunciating didn't make me want to throttle her and I actually feel something when Harry is in the graveyard.",1
1380,8.0,"This movie was absolutely ridiculous!!! They left out many major details that I feel were crucial to the plot. The Quidditch world cup was very disappointing I feel. I was not pleased at all. The Yule Ball was probably my second favorite part, and then the tournament did please me at parts, but not much. I feel sorry for any person who wastes their time going to see it. If you wish to still see it go and see it. I really hope you enjoy it more than I did. It was also supposed to be kind of scary; I jumped one time throughout the whole entire movie and I am a very scared person. I jumped the whole entire time through ""War of the Worlds"" and I jumped one time in this movie. Pitiful? Tell me about it! I did like some of the stuff about it like the effects were amazing. The cast couldn't have been better, and I feel like it was just overall an okay movie. I rate it 8/10!!! That's all I feel it deserved.

(I heard the reason was that they're getting to old for the parts.) And again I'm not sure whether this theory is true or not. If so, I believe that not having the original cast would be lame because you pratically grow up with them. I work at a movie theater so I work with a load of movie freaks. They know everything when it comes to movies. And the rumor going around was about Harry Potter. So once again, does anyone know if the original cast will be playing in the movie after the one that comes out in 2007? If anyone knows if this is true, please inform me whenever possible. Thanks.",0

This one does not though it is so rushed and chaotic at times that it assumes that all have read the books and can follow what in the world is going on. Prisoner of Askaban was creative inventive and a clear case of someone doing everything right from the use of soundtrack to spell bounding lighting and visual effects. The opposite is true of Goblet of Fire. We are sadly back to square one with the films back to the paint by numbers approach that still can't save the director from getting lost in his own jumbled mess of a film.",0

If i hadn't read the book before i saw the movie, i probably would have liked the movie a great deal, but i did read the book, and i am beyond disappointed with what i didn't see in this movie. Sorry to be so negative, but my thoughts about this must be told. Indeed there were many entertaining parts that made me laugh, indeed there were quite a few scenes that were very emotional, but even the 3rd movie was much closer to the book than this movie. Also i must say that the director made it to where the scenes kept jumping around, and that things went way too fast and it was hard to keep up with what was going on. And by the way, i thought that they did very well with the graveyard scene, the way they made Fiennes look depicted exactly what i was imaging voldemort while i was reading the book.",1

The one part they didn't show was that Snape accidentally killed Barty Crouch Jr, but they didn't put that in there. Also, in the book Dobby got Harry Potter gillyweed, not Neville. I wish they had Dobby do it. The special effects were really good though. And when Voldemort rose again, that was scary. I can't wait to see them all and read the very last book. My favorite part in the movie was when Harry was doing the first task with the dragon. I kind of with that all 4 movies had the same director though, cause they there would be similarities. In the 3rd movie, Harry's firebolt was black. In the 4th, it was brown. Professor Flitwick in all 3 had crazy gray hair and beard. In this one is hair was black and tidy, no beard. The pictures on the walls looked just like normal picture. I know I said this was the best movie so far, but why am I dissing it?

1396,7.0,"Harry Potter is back, looking slightly more grown up and with an even more dodgy haircut. I must be one of the only people who think this but for me the film was a let down, the reason for this was for me the film did not do the book justice there were bits of the film that were just skimmed over and seemed irrelevant, the bits with Rita Skeeter for a start, which are much more important in the book. The biggest problem is that the writers have tried to cram as much as they could from the book into the film as possible. There is also the problem that in the book Harry starts to deal with teenage emotions, this is important for the character development but isn't dealt with very well at all in the film, maybe this is because the prime audience for the film is around 8 years old. Which brings me to my final point. You gotta remember who this film is for, ultimately it is for the kids and they will love it, it will indeed keep them occupied for a good two hours or so. They don't care about emotions or exact references from the books and this will be just as good as reading the book if not better. For me though even though the films main market is children it could have been so much better. I mean look at what they managed to do to the Lord of The Rings.",0

I am also not thrilled with the actor who plays Dumbledor- definitely not as good as the original. My husband who has yet to read any of the books, loved the movie.

1403,4.0,"This movie left so much of the back story out and it failed to live up to the hype the other movies created, I wish I would have waited to see this movie when it came to the Dollar Movies (.75 a person for the first showing). The movie opens with Harry's reoccurring dream, scar burning he wakes to Hermione's Voice. They Take the port key, To the world cup, where they left out the entire match if you didn't read the book you would not know who had won. This movie just got more and more disappointing as it went on. My advice to harry potter fans is wait to see the movie when you can rent it or if there is a dollar movie in your town, seeing this movie then would be a great way to spend an afternoon.",0
1404,9.0,"Unfortunately, Harry Potter and the Globet of Fire is a very long book, too long to adapt it and make a movie that has all the trama that the book has. The people that has read the book knows that Dobby, the house elf, also appears on this movie. There are also other characters that appear on the book, and were not mentioned, like Winky, that is another house elf. But the movie in general was a very nice adaptation from the book.I can say that it's better adapted that the last movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Daniel Radcliffe keeps doing better and better, and so being richer and richer. His actuation is the best of the movie. I hope the fifth movie (The Order of the Phoenix) will be much better, and I would also like Sirius to appear a little more in the movie.",0
1405,10.0,"Well for starters , I'm a big fan of Harry Potter. I love all of the Harry Potter series , I've repeated watching them for like thousand times already, so far Goblet of Fire i've only watched about 5 times (one from cinema the rest from DVD ) . During 1st time when I went to the cinema with my mom to watch GOF, I was so exciting , I was really keen to see the film. But unfortunately throughout the film there were this 4 little BUGGING kids sitting behind us , TALKING throughout the whole film. They were talking about Richard Harris death and now have change the new Dumbledore and rumors about Daniel , all sort of rubbish ...and during the part where Harry almost caught the dragon egg, the four mad kids went screaming their lungs out shouting :"" Ahhhh !! harry get the egg ! get the egg ! "" Jesus ,i was sure those people nearby were staring them with these fierce gaze , so does my mum....But anyway back to the movie , I din quite understand when I got out of the theater , probably cause of those kids. I felt a little disappointment of the show , coz i think its a lil rush at some part, is like showing this scene for a while and suddenly boom ,comes another story. As too I din quite know what was it the show was trying to say , but in the end I still got home , still thinking, reading preview, that sorta thing. ",0
1406,6.0,"Now I will start this off by saying that the movie was without a doubt good, but for reasons I will name later on you will realize why it is that I gave this movie the score you see above.",0
1407,10.0,"Seriously i believe that this Harry Potter movie is the BEST out of the 4. So for all of you people that are so pick with whats not in the movie well DEAL WITH IT...its not like they can film the WHOLE book because there's too much, so really just live with it and stop being so critical about everything. Because so what if its missing something who cares? well not a lot of people that actually don't pay attention in comparing the movie to the book. Anyways, i thought that this movie is the best because it had Awesome acting from Daniel Radcliffe(Harry Potter), Emma Watson(Hermione), Rupert Grint(Ron Weasley), Micheal Gambon(Dumbledore) and everyone else. This by far had the most action, horror, drama and Teen hormones in it, which made it good. All the action scenes were impressive and magnificent. The horror was pretty awesome too because in the last 3 movies we didn't see a lot of horror. Now the Drama...so much going on in this movie..it's either drama with friends or drama with love or drama with enemies or just plain old drama, and i think that a lot of the teenagers that saw this movie noticed drama between the characters..well at least i did. Let me just say that this is a great Family movie, action movie, magical movie i've ever seen. They really portrayed the World Quidditch Cup well, the 3 tasks that the 4 champions had to do were very impressive and action filled also, and then the love relationships were also portrayed well. Well i would go and see this movie! definitely i mean i've seen it twice so far and there are more times to come! so go on and watch it! except i probably wouldn't go see it if you bring a 3-6 year old kid along...because of all the horror and stuff.",1
1408,5.0,"To clarify, I'm a big fan of Harry Potter and I'm hoping I won't be bashed for this, but in comparison to the movie I vastly prefer the book. I dropped cash like it was no object to watch the advanced screening and walked out feeling strongly disappointed in the film.",0
1409,10.0,"i've been waiting for this and few minutes before watching the movie i just had to realize..maybe i expected too much...even if the story and the different parts got darker and darker, this one was supposed to be special and i couldn't afford a bad version. Finally i had a lot of contradictions with my mates, where's dooby?No much details with the dragons, Rogue is totally out of the subject...but it works. But Riddle is exactly as i imagined in the book, it's a very sharp and fine version. Actually, the first thing in my mind was planning to get back to the theater later on. The worse thing will be to wait until the next one... The best so far....",0
1410,10.0,"This movie was so much better than the last! I felt that nothing crucial was left out like the last one. I think everyone who has read the books needs to see it. The special effects were awesome too. The dragon scene was so cool and so lifelike. Also the underwater scene with the mermaids was pretty cool too. Oh and the funniest part was when Malfoy was turned into the ferret. You will have to see it for yourself but its hilarious! At the ball, the teenage angst between Parvati, Ron, Hemione, Harry and the other Patil sister was amazing. You could almost feel it. I definitely recommend this movie. People, see it!",1
1411,10.0,"I was blown out of my seat with this one. So many emotions were mixed into this film to make an excellent 4th HP movie. All the disappointments I had with the third movie were cancelled out with this one. Where to start! Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) has grown up so much since the 1st movie, and so has his acting. He is able to bring out his emotions on screen, especially at the end where sorrow is at it's highest. Rupert Grint (Ron) does his usual excellent comedy role and absolutely nails the jealous side of Ron as friction creates between him and Harry. Emma Watson (Hermione) does a great job, acting mainly as Harry's support in difficult times. Romance appears to be in the air with Harry falling for Cho Chang, Ron drooling over Fleur Delacour, and Hermione and Viktor Krum enjoying each others company. New characters include 'Mad-Eye' Moody,new DADA teacher, which is portrayed perfectly by Brendan Gleeson, Rita Skeeter,a reporter, who is reduced to causing a stir rather than complete havoc like that of the book, Igor Karknoff, head of Durmstrang, who seems to have a hidden agenda and Madam Maxime, head of Beauxbatons, who also is falling in love. Snape and Sirius appear briefly in the film. But it's not all fun and games for Harry and friends as the Tri- wizard tournament begins to be used as a killing attempt and Harry falls into grave danger.Who to trust when evil returns is a mystery. Very scary footage causes this film to have a higher rating of PG13(USA) PG12(UK)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a must see!",1
1412,10.0,"Trust this movie is a MUST. The special effects, fantastic. The acting fabulous and the actors looking fabulous as they are doing it. For all the girls out there- the young male actors have changed dramatically and the new ones, like Cedric and Viktor, they are looking very, very striking, so scream when you see them!For the guys as well, the girls from the French school of wizardry are not looking too bad themselves. There is one more thing that was forgotten. The comedy in this movie is sometimes subtle and in others times pretty obvious that you have to laugh. I honestly recommend this movie to be bought on DVD; I mean I'm going to be one of first people to buy the movie on DVD. There is a reason why this movie is rated PG-13^_^. Have a nice time at the cinema!",1
1413,10.0,"I have been a Harry POtter fan since 2000, when I was first old and smart enough to read the books. HP took me into a world I never could dream of, until then, that is. I spent so many hours dreaming of what it all looked like, rereading again and again. When I first heard they were going to make films, I was elated. They were extremely close to what I had imagined, down to the last knut.",0
1414,10.0,"When I first thought about this movie, I was very concerned about the task that Mike Newell faced in making a 700+ page book into a movie, AND make it last less then three hours in length, but after seeing it, I realized that it is definitely the best so far.",1
1415,9.0,"This movie is the best Harry Potter movie yet. As I watched this film and had already watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban I could see how truly awful the first and second movies were. The best decision the producers have made was to pull Chris Colombus out of the directors chair, it has become less for children and more for all ages. I was extremely disappointed when I saw Harry Potter and the Philosipher Stone because the setting was all wrong, Hogwarts was all the sudden on a field but not in the mountains.",0
1416,10.0,"well, i think harry potter and the goblet of fire is the best movie so far!! it has a wonderful content and besides all the actors have done soo well. boo to all the hp haters. it is better than the other harry potter movies because the kids are mature in this movie. they are no more kids. all the tasks have been shown in a wonderful way. the first task, the underwater scene and the maze. it starts off as harry's fourth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardy. the dark lord is coming into power and sends some of his death eaters to the quidichh world cup. and next the triwizard tournament is introduced. harry's name is taken out of the goblet of fire unexpectedly. he has no choice but to participate. and so the story goes on and hogwarts is the champion GO HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!!",1
1417,7.0,"I walked into this movie, expecting very little. And that's what I got. The acting was fine, the affects where magnificent, but it lacked the heart of the first three films.",1
1418,10.0,"I am a huge Potter fan. I saw this movie at the midnight showing. Well worth the wait and money. Acting was great, and awesome cinematography. I felt the tension throughout the entire movie.",1
1419,6.0,"I believe that the director left too much out of this movie. The story line, of course if you are a good Harry Potter fan, is excellent, but so many good things were left out. He could have added more little facts and details instead of leaving it to the bare minimum. Take Doby for instance: He was a semi-important person in this movie and they left him out completely. I'm not trying to say it was a bad movie or anything. I think it was a very good movie, just not what it should have been. I hope they will use a different director on these next movies. The first director was the best in my opinion. If time was such a concern for this new director, than he shouldn't have taken on the task of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.",0
1420,10.0,"Harry Potter just makes a spot somewhere inside of you that rings out: ''This Movie Rocks!'' A classical, made with a little inspiration from the famous writer J.K Rowling. The actors were chosen perfect, the make-up, hair, clothes, everything was designed perfectly, and nothing should change. This movie was based on the 4th book of the series, where there are 3 Triwizard champions all from different schools. That is, until the Goblet of Fire spits out a 4th name, which is none other than Harry Potter! But who did it? Surly Harry couldn't have...you must be 17 or older to enter...was it an older student? A teacher? I know. I've Seen The Movie In Theatres 46 times. But I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't. With an excellent plot, you must have excellent actors/actresses. With Harry Potter you get both. I feel so sorry for those Children whose parents do not approve. But I have something to help you out: The POPE himself, said that he recommends Harry Potter! And Guess What?? So Do I! Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire comes out on March 7th 2006, so that's your chance!",1
1421,6.0,"What a coincidence that the same time I was starting to lose interest in the Harry Potter books, the movies start to take the same nose dive off of their Quiddich Broom. The movie makers have created some amazing scenes, such as the Dragon chase scene, but the rest of the movie, as well as the plot, seems so tied together with what they can create they do not bnother to think whether or not they should create it. I must admit that I have only fallen asleep in one other movie in my life besides this one, but this one had me snoozing long before it was finished. I think JK Rowling needs to focus more on the quality of her books rather than the quantity of pages. That way I will only have to sit through 1 hour of her crap next time and not the full three hours she attempted to keep my eyes open.",1
1422,7.0,"It was actually better watching it on DVD than at the cinema, it just seemed to fly by at the cinema without any REAL content. However when i settled down to watch the DVD i found that i missed quite a lot of information originally.",1
1423,3.0,"The first half hour of the movie was paced like a video clip, in which many parts had the only purpose to cite small excerpts of the first hundred-some pages of the book. The clips themselves had no connection, no harmony and, worst, they failed their sole purpose in deviating A LOT from the novel, interpreting some scenes in a, IMHO, doubtful way.",0
1424,5.0,"Think of James Bond as a TV series, so every movie has familiar characters but a whole new story. The trouble with Harry Potter is that its more like a mini series, with only 1 story (watch out for the bad guy whose name must not be spoken). This isn't enough to sustain me for 4 films. I blame J K Rowling and her impotent editors for the lack of plot, because in actual fact the movie makers have done a pretty good job.",0
1425,5.0,"Well, there are just the main plots of the book in this movie, but the charm of the earlier movies is completely missing, since the director concentrated too much on the special-effects-gimmicks. The sequence with the Quidich world-championship was a real mess, the stadium didn't look like the described one in the book at all, Twinky is completely out of the story, Mrs Weasley is completely missing and so on. There is a sequence with Ron dancing with Profesor McGonagall, that was intended to be funny, but isn't mentioned in the book, Harry was hunted down by the Horntail dragon throughout the campus, just to show how good the animators are, aargh, I got to stop it... Frankly, I can only hope they go back to Chris Columbus as the next director.",0
1426,10.0,Possibly spoilers - But more of a warning....,0
1427,10.0,i thought this was a well filmed film i thought that they have outdone themselves once again. as i thought the last one was good i thought this one beat the rest by a long shot. what can i say they keep getting better. i think that the actors were better and the special effects were better as well. i liked the bigger more interesting story line. it had loads more action it seemed liked the action never stopped.i found Ron especially exciting to watch as i find him funny and a non stop funny character.i like the fact of widening the wizards away from Hogwarts i found these new characters great to watch as they were new and different. can't wait to see the next one.,1
1428,6.0,"The one major aspect about these movies is that if you do NOT read the books, you will enjoy the series. So I will comment it on these aspects. First and foremost, the acting skills of these actors have truly progressed in the years. However, the scene transitions seemed to be rushed. In the first 10 minutes, it progressed to a nightmare, to a portkey, to a one minute tournament, and then a riot, and then a completely obliterated camp, and then a train, and then hogwarts.....SLOW DOWN! Getting rid of the Dursley beginning kind of ruins the pattern we are used to. Also, the graveyard scene was much too short and these sudden transitions ruin the feel of the movies. It seems they are just pushing all the scenes together and it wasn't edited well enough. So for all this, I give the movie 7 out of 10 ON A NON-BOOK Comparison.",0
1429,8.0,"I throughly enjoyed the movie. If you are only following the movies themselves, all four flow together in the storyline. If, however you have read the books; several omissions seem glaring. I thought the movie definitely displayed teenage angst quite well. Having watched the movie several times,(I own the DVD),in the maze scenes does Krum/Stan have any injury to his right hand? His right hand appears to be bandaged. I thought creating the Great Hall into a ice castle was the perfect setting for the Yule Ball. I throughly enjoyed Ralph F. portrayal of Lord Voldemort. He was frightening and fascinating at the same time. Also Harry's scenes with ""Myrtle"" in the bath were wonderfully amusing,again playing to teenage sensibilities. I am now awaiting the release of ""Order of the Phoenix"" in 2007.",1
1430,9.0,"I've now watched the film several times, and although a number of the scenes are different to those in the book, they certainly do not spoil the enjoyment of the film. The different slant on the way the maze was done, and the extra added scenes (the dance lesson with McGonagall and Ron is particularly good - I think Rupert Grint has a real future in comedic roles) were great. The three main actors are definitely growing into their roles, and the speculation after the first couple of films, as to whether they would not stay to do all seven, is proving to be false. I'm glad, as I would now find it hard to imagine anyone else in the roles! The only disappointments for me were the lack of Quidditch World Cup action, and that some of the characters from the book (Ludo Bagman, Amos Diggory) were either completely different from how they were described, or missing completely. My one hope now is that, like the LoTR trilogy, that they think about releasing a 'director's cut' version of each of the films, as they must have LOADS of extra scenes!",1
1431,10.0,"I am a complete and utter die hard fan of the Harry Potter series and i have to say that this is the best movie yet. Although i adore the other 3, this one is in a different class of its own, with the acting and special effects. I have to point out some bad things as well. The one thing i was genuinely disappointed about was the fact that only one classroom scene was in the whole movie. that is what i liked about the other films, we got to see them in actual school surroundings. Anyway i definitely wasn't disappointed with the action scene particularly the 3 tasks and Voldemort's reappearance. wow was i scared when i first saw Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. and even though i have read the book and i knew what was going to happen i did shed a tear when Cedric was murdered. Although things went a bit too fast and for non-readers of the series they will be confused at times, Mike Newell did very well for such a long book. Of course i went and pre-ordered the DVD as soon as i could and watch it at least 3 times a week!",1
1432,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet! It doesn't really fit it's PG-13 rating but it is more violent than the other 3. Even though they cut out a lot of the good parts, it was still excellent. The only bad part is that Voldemort's nose looks retarded (well.. he doesn't really have one). Any one else writing a review about this movie please give a good rating because it deserves it. Whoever likes Harry Potter will love this movie. I must warn you though the graveyard part is a little scary for younger children.The dragon part also is a little violent. But it still is a superb movie. Thanks! I hope this review is helpful to you.",1
1433,8.0,"This movie is good if you think of it as nothing but as a form of entertainment. However, if you were expecting an accurate adaptation to the book, you're out of luck. No Ludo Bagman, Bertha Jorkins, or Winky. It spoils who shot off the dark mark, which means the many mysteries of the book basically only go down to who put Harry's name in the goblet. They even spoil that Barty Jr is disguised as Moody because they added the snake tongue that wasn't in the book! If you've read the book, this movie is probably a 5 or 6 out of 10, but since I'm just judging the movie it's good and enjoyable enough to get an 8.",1
1434,8.0,"Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is back in a new year, new attitude of anger, ""BIG"" surprises and the one we all hate Lord Voldemort (Ralph Phines) has come back himself, stronger than before and waiting to kill Harry with his anger of revenge. Harry's (Radcliffe) life becomes a little more complicated with a new crush and strange happenings. This all starts when Harry had a dream about Voldemort (Phines) getting stronger. He then discovered along with his 2 best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) that not only was Voldemort getting stronger, but also had a way of killing Harry when his name was mysteriously put into the Goblet of Fire and then was also picked to participate in the Triwizard Tournament.

1436,8.0,"It was truly worth the wait ! The new Harry Potter movie has all the elements to captivate the young and the adult simultaneously. The characters have grown up very suitably with the actors themselves. The special effects are good but can't help feeling that the movie failed to reach its potential in this regard. Possibilities were endless, couldn't they show something more incredible ? May be the next one will !! The only disappointment I have after viewing the movie is regarding lord Voldemort's return. His return was awesome and long-awaited. But, the fact that a 14-year-old boy successfully fought him head-to-head (even if for few seconds) and managed to escape, somehow lessened the aura of darkness associated with Voldemort. Couldn't Harry just escape without taking him on ?!!! That would make me wait for the future battles between the two with a lot more anticipation. Here lies a hint of disappointment ! However, Ralph Fiennes seems to give a new life to Voldemort in the true sense. Casting could not have been any better. Even though the movie runs for more than two hours, I never felt it was too long. On the contrary, I felt sad while leaving the movie hall. Why ? Because I will have to wait another couple(?) of years to see the next one !!",0
1437,10.0,"Everything about this movie has made me love the Harry Potter franchise even more. The special effects were outstanding. The acting improves for each film. The pace was fast and satisfying. Although I am not a fan of Mike Newell and his directing, he has turned this movie into something I was not expecting at all: a thriller. I was very impressed with how they handled the editing of this film. Each scene in the film was necessary and they didn't add anything silly or pointless. They left out the right things and kept the right things. These movies keep growing as they progress, and I can only hope that the next film is even better. The movie also kept its darkness, which I am very happy about, and I hope the films continue to appeal to an older audience. Bravo!",1
1438,6.0,"I have given this film a 6 because as a Harry Potter fan, I must admit this film did well in visualizing scenes from the Goblet of Fire book. However, viewed as a cinematic work it was very disappointing. The characters of Fred and George are more prominent adding a lot of comedy to the film, but almost all of the jokes were dependent on them, most of the jokes being slapstick. With Harry being 14 years old in this film, obviously there is going to be a new adolescent sexuality to his character, but that was the main topic of the film when he wasn't battling a dragon or casting a spell. Some scenes with this new sexuality lasted precious minutes past their prime, leaving no room for the amazing older actors such as Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. Emma Watson was adorable as Hermione in the first film, but now she doesn't seem to be able to portray emotion without melodramatics. The main problem with this film, however, is trying to fit a some 600 page book into a 2 1/2 hour film. The book was well represented, I have no beef as a Potter fan about that. But trying to fit in all these pages lead to the most blatant explication imaginable. Film is a visual medium with sound attached. In intro screen writing classes, the number one lesson is to show not tell, which Steve Klove seemed to completely ignore. All the questions that arise during the film are nicely and neatly explained with a dull conversation between Harry and one of his smarter companions. He hardly finds anything out for himself. My advice, wait until it comes out on video, that way you can fall asleep in the comfort of your own home.",0

When i found out that this movie was going to be 157 mins long, i was like, ""What in the world."" Now, i'm not letting this movie down. I think they did a good job in making it. We see a darker side of harry potter in this movie. But how could they take a 756 page book, and turn it into a two and a half hour movie. If i was the one writing the screenplay, i would have made it longer. This movie is a whole lot better then the first three, although the third one remains my fav. ",0

1441,10.0,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and this is absolutely my favorite book out of all of them. So it stands to reason that I would be far more critical of this film than the others. I thought for sure when I went in to watch the film that it would the kind of movie I would not be happy with. You know, criticize the whole thing until I didn't enjoy it at all anymore. But that didn't happen thank god! It's my favorite film and my favorite book. My favorite film all time actually. I can't wait for the next one.

1443,1.0,"Ralph Fiennes was alright, but the director ruined his scene. I don't like that he took great parts out of the movie, but I can understand it. I do not understand why he completely demolished the climax of the movie. The director had Ralph talking as fast as those guys at the end of a car commercial. Also, there was absolutely no transition to the scenes in the movie. It went straight from the bus to foreign schools arriving at Hogwarts. I did think that they did okay with the first and second tasks. The third task was just sad. Oh no, vines. Anything but vines. That couldn't get a five year old's heart pumping. Emma Watson's acting has gone way downhill. Her cry scene after the yule ball was almost as bad as Harry's in POA after he found out that James and Sirius were friends. I would say the best part of the movie was Alastor Moody, but when he turned into Barty Crouch Jr, they included nothing except Dumbledoor saying that they were short a prisoner. If you have to take a scene out, do it. But don't ruin the scenes that you put in. If you see this movie, don't expect much.",0

First off, let me say that from a chaste movie only stand point, this movie would appear much inferior than to someone who have read the book. It is almost a prerequisite to read the book and exercise the movie more as visual companion. There are numerous plot holes, inadequate story telling and the pacing was horrendous. ",0
1445,9.0,"Wow, this movie...no this series, is so completely amazing. J.K. Rowling is a genius to write such wonderful books and the movie is spectacular. It just has a way of opening the kid in all of us, the part that still believes in magic. There were a few things that I think could have been changed. I would have like if the movie were more like the book. I really don't like it when some directors decide to practically change the whole story from its original book, like Ella Enchanted. I loved that book but the movie wasn't nearly as good. You know what I mean? Any way, Daniel Radcliffe looks fabulous. I mean he's a really good Harry Potter, i cant imagine anyone else being Harry Potter.",1

At the beginning of the release of this fairy tale, my mother began to read to me and my younger brother a story about a boy who survived. After the first book, I fell in love with this story. After reading all the books, I started watching movies. Yes, movies will never be able to convey all the fabulousness of the Harry Potter universe. But it was this film that absolutely disappointed me.",0
1447,7.0,"Did anyone else think the movie was a bit off ? I mean, I know they can't put everything in the movie that was in the book, but come on, they missed so much. For instance, the lack of Weasleys, no Percy, Bill, Charlie or Mrs. Weasly. We barely see Sirius, no Dobby, no Winky, no S.P.E.W. They do explain the thing with Barty Crouch Jr. but they change the story so that he escaped from Azkaban but they said nothing about his Mother or being under the Imperius curse from his Father. Also, me and my friend were really looking forward to seeing them play at the Quidditch world cup, yes, they did go to the world cup, but you didn't even get to see the teams play. All in all the movie went by to fast for me, everything up to when the champions arrive was about what ten minutes? I found myself constantly saying, we are to that part already? What happened to this part or that part? I was also a little disappointed that Sirius barely made an appearance in the movie, was looking forward to the scene where he reveals himself to Mrs. Weasly and a whole lot of other scenes. However, the movie does have extremely funny parts and extremely sad parts. As a series kind of separate from the books it was a great movie (though, I was a tad disappointed in it all) though,compared to the books, it doesn't even hold a candle. Explanations about why things are done the way they are done, well, lets just say the movie just skims the explanations of it all, not really explaining anything at all. However, the end was very memorable, I just prefer the books over the movie.",0
1448,7.0,"I was disappointed in this installment of Harry Potter. For me the heart of the Harry Potter series has been the relationships between Harry, Hermoine, and Ron and this movie by far was the worst at delving into that subject.

1449,9.0,"This is the best film in the series. It is the darkest yet because of the return of Lord Voldemort and therefore it is unsuitable for really young kids to see. However there is an all-star cast such as David Tennent, the new Doctor Who, and Miranda Richardson for the adults to enjoy.",1
1450,3.0,Having read the book I found it annoying to watch.First of all I pictured moody to be a thin withered battered but none the less a respectable character when I read the book but I found the movie version of him insulting to the character. I understand that many things must be left out in order for this film to be made without a 7 hour running time. But I couldn't stop noticing things that are important to the story being left out. I am not a major harry potter fan and I do see the good points about the film such as the brilliant cg effects and good acting of some of the stars. One other character that was portrayed wrongly was lord voldemort Who instead of frighting looked rather ridiculous.He looked better in the first one. So overall a good effort but I just didn't enjoy it.,0
1451,8.0,"I love the Harry Potter series, I own all of the books and the movies. This being said I would like to say that I enjoyed the movie, i thought that all in all it did a good job. I do wish that it had a little more than just the Triwizard Tournament. Because the movie centered around the tournament it seemed rushed. Having read the book I felt that I didn't even know what was going on at the beginning of the movie because it was so chaotic. The best part of the movie was the graveyard scene, although it was a too short and Voldemort has more mood swings than a pregnant woman, Ralph Fiennes does a good job. The graveyard scene was satisfactory. The absolute WORST part of the movie was the inclusion of Barty Crouch Jr. at the beginning and his face at the world cup. It was completely unnecessary and ruined the big reveal.",0

I love her very strong!!!All my dreams are about her.I want to make happiness for her.Sorry for my English but i'm from Russia and don't know this very well.But i want to speak about my love . My sense are very strong.She is genius and incredibly clever girl.She played very well and i think that she is very talented girl.Clemence i want to say to you that you are very beautiful and clever and talented and amazing girl.,1
1455,7.0,"I am not a fan of Harry Potter, so you can trust me when I say this movie is quite good, very easy and fun to watch. Really, I am no Harry Potter fan, let me point my case so you'll believe me in case you're not fans and want to know if you're gonna enjoy your spent money or just throw it away to the garbage. I know the story because now it turns out that all of my friends are fans of the little mage. I saw the first movie since, as a movies fan, i wanted to know what the whole buzz was all about. I became disappointed, i was awfully bored, that was the problem, well that and all the silly situations,i believed none of them, i didn't buy them,i could forgive anything but watching a boring film, seeing a kid finding an invisible cloak is neither new nor fun for me. Of course I didn't watch the sequels, don't mention the books, but as i tell you, i seem to be the one that's wrong, now i have a girlfriend that craves everything that has to do with HP. So here i am, at the movie theater, one hour earlier to the show, i am psychologically preparing myself to watch more of the same unbelievable child tale I saw a long time ago, and they say the movie is about 2 hrs and a half long, damn. After a few silly situations the movie starts getting to a point, more important, it is fun, hey all i wanted was that from the beginning, the characters become somehow real, as real as an adventure movie can be, and the rhythm is perfect, of course, i kept laughing at some others situations, specially at the end, but hey, the overall experience was fine with me, the FX, some really nice photography, real fun characters (the twins despite being total jerks are quite fun), and lots of action, i'm telling you, this is not the ultimate adventure-action-fantasy film of all the time, but even if you don't have a son, girlfriend or friends begging u to go with them because Harry Potter is oh so fantastically marvelous and all way cool, you can seriously watch this film with no regrets, is a solid, agile action paced movie with fine FX and nice music and cinematography, truly fun.",1
1456,,This is the worst Harry Potter movie that I ever seen!The storyline of this movie is has nothing in common with the storyline of book 4!There many things that are drop like Hagrid and Madam Maxime!And where is the practice when Harry learn Accio?The sphinx and the other monster in the maze?And the scene where Heormine tells Harry for the forbidden forest is ridiculous!The movie is short and very dark!I cannot see in moments what is happening!The ball is disappointing and the reconcile between Harry and Ron is embarrassing!There are more things that are wrong in this movie(like Krum's jogging)!The only things I enjoy was the first task and the prepare for the ball!And where is Rita Skeeter's transformation into bug?The whole movie is something like very wrong interpretation of the book 4!,0

1458,3.0,"the plot lines that have been dropped for sakes of visual effects are so many, that this film becomes a mere suggestion of what is described in the book. I would call it ""the sketch or outline for those who didn't read Goblet of Fire"". That's what happens when one tries to squeeze the book of 734 pages into one 2,5 hour film. I think they REALLY could use the experience of Kill Bill and make it in two parts. Hope they will not make the same mistake with the Order of Phoenix.",0

Gooo....",1
1461,8.0,"I really liked this movie, of course, I've liked all of them. The main problem I had was it was SUPER fast, so fast paced it was choppy in parts. I HOPE the DVD has an extended version. There's so much room for more. I'd of been happy if the movie'd been twice as long. Also, Fleur wasn't nearly pretty enough and her hair wasn't white. All in all it was great, funny and touching. Not for young children though, the ending especially is kind of scary and the rest of the movie has some adult themes. I kind of wish I hadn't read the book before hand, just because I'm a little biased due to how much I loved the book. At any rate, ""Mad-Eye"" Moody is still an awesome character. I can't wait for the next one! I did wish Winky and Dobby had shown back up, and that Hermoine had introduced SPEW.",1
1462,10.0,"The fourth movie is easily the best of the Harry Potter series so far. It is very roughly unedited and at first viewing that takes away from the quality of the movie. However, having seen this movies twice I am very impressed with how much the child actors have matured and stepped into their roles. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is no longer simply a children's movie it is an excellent adventure flick for the whole family to enjoy. I really enjoyed the dynamic between the trio as they face personal problems that are common with growing up and dealing with puberty and the challenges of adulthood. Hopefully the gaps of this movie will be filled in the DVD edition. I would have liked more on screen time between Dumbledore and Harry, there is almost none. Since Dumbledore is Harry's father figure there should be more time for them to bond and share fears.",1
1463,6.0,"I liked this movie from a movie standpoint but when you consider the book it's from you have to feel a bit let down. I understand that some things have to be left out when you consider the movie is already 2 1/2 hours long and to include everything from the book would make it 2x longer but knowing the series is going to continue means you can't leave out pertinent information. I certainly hope that some of the things left out of GoF are not just dropped from OotP because that would be terrible considering some things continue into HBP and possible the last book. I also have to say that adding things that were not in the book is a waste of time they could have used to put in some of the REAL story. I hope OotP is even better. I didn't mind the way PoA was a little different from the book because it kept all the important stuff and was so close to be accurate that it's hard to notice. The first two were so much like the book that most readers would be able to skip the first 2 books and go strait to PoA without losing anything. Maybe JK wanted the movies and books to differ so everyone would say ""See the movie for the action and read the book for the story..."" That way she wins twice.",1
1464,5.0,"Okay, I have to admit, I didn't start out as a Harry Potter fan. It wasn't until the first movie came out, and my friend tricked me into going, that I became a devotee. I remember sitting in the theater, enthralled as i watched this magical story unfold. Quidditch, dragons, and the Magical feel of Hogwards had me racing to the store for the books. It was then I entered the Wizarding world. I loved it. As the books progressed, getting darker and more adult, my love of the series grew. My love of the movies however... have not. I'm picky i guess. I think that overall the movies were okay, but none of them to date have given me that magical feeling the first one did. Goblet of Fire came close though. I was disappointed at first, there was no beginning confrontation with the Dursley's, which i admit i had been looking forward to. Bagman was done away with. The World Cup was reduced to nearly 20 seconds. Since Bagman had been done away with, there was no set up for Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes. So very much was left out that I felt was needed to make the future story complete. Once i tried to forget that I had indeed read the book though, i started to enjoy it a bit more. I was really upset though over the status of Hogwarts. It's gone from looking like a magical castle, to looking like a dingy, dank and depressing place. Ah well. Here's to hoping Phoenix will make up for it.",0
1465,10.0,"I know that there have been some bashers of this movie saying that it sucks because lots of stuff was cut out. Well, GOF doesn't suck. It's a great movie, and the vast majority of you will love it. The things the filmmakers cut out, I didn't miss too much. The entire thing clicks together as a great movie. When you go to it, don't expect to see a great adaptation of the book, expect to see an amazing film that blows the other 3 HP films away. Now, for some specific stuff.",1
1466,10.0,"I believe that this wonderful Harry Potter film was very nearly, as we say in the town of Grolkisdon, ""Sehr Blauschmut"". However, I would like to point out a few trifling details I spotted while I was lustily watching this exhibit. Firstly, I must point out that the 234th hair on the left hemisphere of Miss Emma Watson's head was at an angle of 2.5 degrees, when it should really have been at 2.6 degrees. Very disappointing, I say. Secondly, at 22 minutes and 43 seconds, the wrist movement of the spell, ""Poco Rallentando"" was not quite at the correct tempo and enunciation. The result of this would have theoretically produced a flying elephant, instead of the flying mouse intended. Thirdly, I am quite sure that Mr. Rupert Grint's hair tint was of the colour ""Raddish Red 23.4 + Carrot Orange 2.5 + Ginger Ginger 456.4"" and not, as it should have been, ""Raddish Red 23.4 + Carrot Orange 2.5 + Ginger Ginger 457.4."" As you should know, a difference of one extra Ginger Ginger tint can make a ""Grossengross"" difference. As for Mr. Daniel Radcliffe, there are simply too many incorrect movements and characteristics to mention them all. However, one of the most obvious and noticeable was that of his incorrectly positioned nose  his nose should really be of a length of 2.45 inches, when it happened to actually be 2.58 cm. This was rather alarming, and ""Munchküntin,"" as the population of Grolkisdon would have said. Another glaring mistake was that the pronunciation of the name, ""Professor McGonagall"" at 120 minutes and 3 seconds, was at a pitch of 212 Hz, and as you should know, the proper pitch for such a word is in fact 424 Hz. When I heard this improper speech, I was so disturbed that I actually shouted, ""Lëntauschaumt!"" as we say in Grolkisdon. However, aside from these mistakes, I must say that I highly enjoyed this movie and would most certainly recommend this for all species of cat.",0

1469,6.0,"I don't know about anyone else, but I was kinda disappointed with this movie. There were a lot of things that I didn't like, but the things that bothered me the most were: the movie was made way too dark then I think it should have been (and I wish that they had made it a little lighter), I didn't like the fact that they had to delete so many of the scenes (like the actual Quidditch match), and I wish they had kept some of the characters (like the house elves and the Dursleys). I don't know... I don't think that it was as good as the first two HP movies. If each of the newer HP movies keep going on like this, I might not go and watch them (well... I might go see it because I think that the guy who plays Ron is the most hilarious person in each and every movie and also because I love the guys who plays Professor Snape).",1

There was also a perfect mixture of tension, action, emotion and comedy. The trio's acting has improved so much.

Every detail was exactly how i had imagined it in my mind whilst reading the books and as a person who obsesses over the books to almost psychopathic proportions that is really saying something! All i can say is, go and see it. Judge for yourself. i promise you this film will not disappoint :D",1
1474,7.0,It would have been a great *summary* if they had noticed one thing. WHY ON EARTH DID THEY DOWN PLAY SIRIUS'S FATHER ROLE?!?!?!? This is supposed to be the movie in which he takes an active role as a god PARENT and watches Harry's back and with the exception of one scene he wasn't in it? If anyone has any ideas as to why he was basically cut out of the last 3/4 of the movie. It would be appreciated. It just seemed as if Gary Oldman died after filming that one scene and they decided to not replace him or something... (he isn't dead by the way)...,0
1475,7.0,"I went to the midnight show to see GOF. A midnight show should start at midnight, wouldn't you think? However, after 30 minutes (yes, 30 minutes) of TV commercials and movie previews, GOF started at 12:30 am. I enjoyed the movie, but I felt that I was rushed through the whole thing. For example, the movie opened with Frank Bryce being murdered by Voldemolt (there was also a man in the room with Volty, Wormtail and Nagini), and Harry waking up at the Burrow (by Hermione) with his scar burning. Then, they were off to the Quiddich World Cup, which was very short, but with good special effects. No Winky next to Harry, and Ludo Bagman and Percy Weasley were not in the movie at all. Then it was back to the campsite. When everyone was screaming and the Death Eaters were walking about, Mr. Weasley told everyone to go the Portkey. People were running and screaming and Harry got knocked out and was separated from the Weasley bunch. When he awoke, the campsite was destroyed and saw a man lurking about. This man conjured the Dark Mark. Then the Weasley bunch found Harry, Hermione told Harry what the Dark Mark was, then they left. All of this happened within 10-15 minutes from the start of the movie. Whew! What a roller-coaster ride! The director, Mike Newell, went against the studio's request for a two-part movie. He tried to get the gist of the book into a little over 2hr movie. I was impressed by the special effects, since his previous movies didn't involve them.",0

All the characters convince the audience that these young actors are up for the task. The movie was indeed darker than the last three altogether but everything is leading up to the whole series..that's what is going to happen. The books are becoming darker and so are the movies. This has been the best movie I have seen so far, and the director, Mike Newell was awesome. Everyone did a good job.

A HUGE one, though, that really bothers me is that Voldemort's eye are BLUE, they're supposed to be RED!

Everyone in the cast have done an amazing job of portraying their characters. The screenplay was excellent, considering there is a lot of magic involved with the triwizard tournament involved.

Although I found the'Goblet of Fire' book quite tedious and the most difficult to get into, the film more than did it justice. It really portrayed the dark, sinister elements of the story well, and also the changing maturity of the 3 main characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione. There is also more humour in this film than in the others, which does well to keep it from becoming perhaps too serious. There is really little fault I could find with the film, the only problem is if you haven t read the book it may be slightly confusing where parts of the story which have been missed out. I also recommend you consider whether or not to take very young children to see this,it may be too frightening for them.",1

Also, the whole Quidditch world cup was removed, which was a little disappointing. Although, there were a few parts in which things were mentioned, but not thoroughly explained, as in the story. Like, the fact that Snape was a Death Eater. He was mentioned in Dumbledore's pensive, but not fully explained. Also, Rita Skeeter and Viktor Krum were supposed to show up and speak more.

But this is glitz, not the greatness of the previous movies. Showyness has been traded for substance. That is not a good trade. What is missing is the development of relationships, various important characters and the beauty that were incorporated into the first 3 movies. The interaction and reasons for events are ignored.

1502,,"After I have seen the film 2 times, I'm still disappointed, to many things have been cut out, and persons missing... Where is Percy, Charlie,Molly or Bagman? Where is Winky and Dobby? It is great entertainment, but as a Harry Potter fan, I want the movies to be true to the books, which this film isn't! But I don't want to write an essay, but only tell that I was very very sad to see Fiennes' acting as Voldemort... Voldemort was not what I had expected... he looked like Rambo gone mental... Too muscular, too human and not at all frightening... Jason Isac were more scary than Ralph Fiennes... Mike Newell should have done that better...",1
1503,3.0,"Having been an avid Harry Potter reader since I first picked up the books, I have to say that this movie was a disappointment. I realize that the movies are rarely accurate in comparison to the books, but my comments are less about accuracy and more about content and consistency. I'm not familiar with the director, but I found that the constant jumps from scene to scene were difficult to follow, and the characters were not as fully developed as in previous pictures. This director seems to have focused almost entirely on special effects; and while the effects where dazzling, they weren't enough to carry the story. I was also disappointed that once again the managers of the film chose to follow the ""time rule"" that is commonly used in the film industry today. The ""time rule"" allows for films to be no shorter than 60 minutes, and no longer than 3 hours. In the past, films have been allowed more time (Gone With the Wind was 3hrs. 42min.; Schindler's List was 3hrs. 15min.). Given the fact that the book was twice the (until then) usual length, the movie should have been allowed more time to flesh out the story and characters. I currently wait anxiously for the final book in the series, and only cautiously for the next film.",0
1504,5.0,"I'm new to the Harry Potter world. I just read all six books over the last two months. In fact, it was the third movie, and its excellent direction and overall theme, that convinced me to give the books a go. And I became a true convert. I engaged in HP discussions over dinner. I convinced many jaded friends to give the series a go, especially since book four, arguably the second-best to book six, was about to be released on the big screen. But alas, the new Harry Potter movie was a disappointment. The book was massive, and creative license was necessary to condense so much action into a 2.5 hour movie, but the screenwriter/director team failed to bring the fullness of J.K. Rowling's vision to the big screen.",0

I don't think I have ever been hit so hard with emotional changes so fast, and I LOVED it! I laughed, I got excited, scared, tense, nervous, and I even cried! I know what your thinking.. what kind of nerd cries in a Harry Potter movie?? Well you all better be ready for the emotional roller coaster your about to ride because its unbelievably excellent. This has always been my favorite book of the series, but is now, by far, my favorite movie! So please, everyone, go see it, because you will not be disappointed.",1
1508,10.0,"I saw this movie last night and I had previously read some of the reviews. They either said that the movie wasn't that good or it was the best one yet. I went into the movie not expecting it to be the best movie just so I wouldn't be disappointed. After 10 minutes of watching to ""Goblet"" I knew that this was going to be my favorite movie of the year!!! The movie didn't follow the book exactly but they put in all of the major parts and the parts that they did take out weren't that important. Dumberdore wasn't his calm self either but it didn't ruin the movie like some other reviews said. Even though I have read the book numerous times, my heart was still pumping in many occasions!! The acting was great too; Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have gotten much better since the first movie. Mike Newell did a great job directing as well. What more can I say? I LOVED the movie and I hope that all of the other Harry Potter lovers will enjoy this movie as much as I have. Go out and watch it as soon as you can, it is definitely worth it!!! And even if you aren't a Harry Potter lover (don't know why anyone wouldn't be) you should still go out and see it!!!",1
1509,8.0,"Having been disappointed with the previous disjointed Potter films that seemed to hurtle through each storyline at such breakneck speed, Goblet of Fire is a real breath of relief. GoF seems to be where the franchise really finds it's feet and displays a confidence that finally allows the screen adaptation to step out aside of the rigidities of book adaptation; and all for the better.",0
1510,10.0,"this movie is not only the best harry potter by far, but also the best movie i have seen all year. i actually cheered for the characters (especially harry) throughout the whole thing. this one is even up there with the lord of the rings trilogy. in fact, i was so surprised at how emotionally drained i was at the end, Harry's acting was just so good. it was as perfect as a movie that is based off of a 734 pg. could be. this has certainly brought my excitement back to the franchise, (after Prisoner of Azkaban, which was mediocre in my opinion). This director (who was offered to cap the first hp) has definitely captured the excitement and the atmosphere of 'you-don't-have-any-idea-of-what-comes-next' that J.K. Rowling masterfully crafted in her novels.",1
1511,8.0,"I thought it was one the best movie out of all the harry potter movies. Although they weren't as faithful to the book as the first and second movies were. It was always exciting, a good adventure film. But I would like to say that most people who will like this movie have to be fans of the books, and have saw the first three films, otherwise its pretty confusing. At some points the movie was very dark, at times. One section that I wouldn't really recommend for young viewers is after the Quidditch World Cup. Also at the end of the movie. Very entertaining though, the actors have really grown; even from the third movie, I thought that Daniel Radcliffe has improved so much. From his crying scene in the third and in the fourth, you can definitely see the improvement; it was much more believable. All in all, an excellent, compelling story; just one of the reasons why Harry Potter has kept going.",1
1512,8.0,"I think that This is an awesome movie. It has wicked special effects and grabs the audiences attention. I think that it ends in a way it leaves the audience unsure like who won the cup. All sequels end like that any i find so it makes you want to see the other half. I can't wait till the others come out. I will be seeing them in theaters. I find its more effective like that. I think its a great movie you should go see If you haven't seen the others yet, go see them in order first before you see this one. You'll understand more if you see them in order. If your a softie, u might want to bring a blanket to hide under and a box or tissues for some parts. You'll be on the edge of your chair the whole time and will not want to leave and get up!",1
1513,6.0,"I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ADAPTATION OF THE 4TH HARRY POTTER BOOK, THE GOBLET OF FIRE. This book was a favorite of mine of the whole Harry Potter series. I walked in hoping to see what I envisioned while reading the book. Where the book allows the reader to become emotionally connected with the characters and what happens to them. THE MOVIE DOES NO SUCH THING. IT IS APPALLING HOW THE MOVIE REMAINS SO DISTANT WITH HOW THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. The relationship that forms between Harry and Cedric in the book is no where to be seen in this new movie. Fortunately for me I read the book and knew what was supposed to be happening. For the non reader they would not be able to feel for the character when something happened to them fully whether it was good or bad, because the movie did not form the attachment for them. This was not the only disappointment in the movie. Too many things were cut out along with characters that were not even in the movie. A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT ONES WERE THE FACT THAT WINKY WAS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND, HERMIONE'S REVENGE ON RITA SKEETER DID NOT TAKE PLACE, THE PRIZE MONEY THAT HARRY WON AND EVENTUALLY GAVE TO THE WEASLEY TWINS FOR THEIR JOKE SHOP, WHICH IS CONTINUED IN FUTURE BOOKS, AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT DETAILS WERE NOT EVEN SUGGESTED OR THEY WERE COMPLETELY CHANGED. This left a deflated feeling for this viewer. who was looking forward to seeing one of her favorite books take place on the movie screen. I realize it is very difficult to take such a long book and make a movie from it, but if you are going to do it justice, less time should be spent on adding things that did not happen as well as changing things that did happen in the book. Creative art is honest , true to itself , not adding something just to show off the special effects and to forget about characters that are already endeared to the audience. I would have enjoyed it better if the movie was more true to the book and used the important descriptive and funny details that would have given meaning to the story for the viewer. Now it will be more difficult to truly continue with the accurate story in the future movies. It is a pity that the director and writer for this script went in the direction that they did. Overall, the movie was fairly good but it left this viewer with a feeling that something was not right.",0
1514,6.0,"Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire book has won millions of hearts with its great storyline and imagination. J.K Rowling has done her part well as an author, creating such beautiful imagination with one thing in her mind: Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. And thus creating more books on Harry and his adventures which Christopher Columbus chose to helm this book series to the big screen. Though he has chose not to film the 3rd book, Alfonso Cuaron took the director seat and made it the worst of the trilogy(only had 3 HP films at that time.) I'm so glad that Mike Newell took the 4th book and portrayed real good on screen.",0

1516,9.0,"This movie is my favorite out of the series. It's hilarious and a must-see. They did leave quite a few things out that were in the book, but it was a great adaption considering the Goblet of Fire is the longest book so far. Even if you didn't read the book, the plot is pretty easy to follow and the acting is good. The trio did a great job and so did all of the new additions to the cast. (Katie Leung, Clemence Poesy, Robert Pattinson, Stanislav Ianevski) The special effects in this movie are amazing and I'd say that they were the best out of the four movies. In other words, this movie is one that you can't miss, and one you might want to go see again.",1
1517,6.0,When i saw the movie i was like OMG because they've cut so much out of this movie. I mean what happened with the world cup and the lead up to getting there seriously and what happened with the house elves there was meant to be house elves in this movie... well there should have been because isn't there meant to be a big deal about the fact that Winky was stuck with the wand after the dark mark was conjured.,0
1518,7.0,"I'm watching the Harry Potter films for the first time obviously way after they came out , I have just finished watching the first four, and I thought I would give my word on this one. I have never read the books, so I'm not going to be one of those people who are just ranting on whether it was or wasn't accurate to the books. I'm just giving my opinion after watching the first three, then watching this one. Here we go, well something gigantic happens in this movie, Voldemort returns. Although this is a huge event, it felt shadowed by all the others things that happen in the movie. The tournament of the three schools and the competitions seems to take up the whole movie. Which leaves barely any time for something so huge to happen, I mean I just felt that something like that should almost have an entire movie of it own (and I know that they have to follow the books, so they can't do that but come one). I just felt that lord Voldemort's return should be a gigantic part of the story, but it just felt like it was somewhat minor. Other than that I did like this movie, and found it enjoyable. And I honestly can't wait to see the rest in the coming days.",0

The age is right the kids look like the age they should be. This is the BEST YET! I hope this comment helps you buy maybe you don't like it some I have talked to said it is the worst yet but I disagree 100% The special affects on the Dark Mark and the greatest adventures so far in the Black lake and the Enchanted maze also the Hungarian Hornback was an excellent feature the movie cant be better! I loved it and MANY people agree with me I saw the line for midnight showings it is such a long line! I went on opening day and that line was also huge at the theater i went to it is sold out completely! so That is the movie the movie has great characteristics to it also. THE BEST YET! How can this movie be horrible? I have a question how can ANY Harry Potter movie be horrible?,1
1525,4.0,I think my biggest mistake was re-reading the novel right before seeing the movie. It made what was missing in the transition between novel and movie all the more apparent.,0
1526,9.0,"This is a great movie for those who are looking for a mixture of humor and fantasy, and of a somewhat darkness. However, for a movie like this, you need great character development. Despite all of the excellent acting, i didn't quite FEEL for any of the characters,maybe a little bit, but it didn't quite hit the spot for me, especially harry potter. Unlike the book, there wasn't much of a build up of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, Harry and Sirius.They could've added 2 more minutes of dialogue from the book that are extremely vital to the series, and 20 more minutes of scene's to build on harry's relationship with characters other than his two best friends, Ron and Hermione. Also a lot of the scenes were a bit rushed, and some scenes didn't connect with each other. Readers of harry potter books, such as me, would be really disappointed due to the fact of how a lot of the book wasn't followed. On top of that, a few key characters were left out. i understand that David Yates had to shorten this but there are ways to add 20-30 minutes to cover some really important stuff. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie in a non-reader's, (of the book), view but i think David Yates could've added 20-30 more minutes to satisfy the larger portion of viewers, who consist of ppl who have read the book. There's a major difference between the viewers of the movie, there are those who have read the book and those who haven't, so i'll give this movie two different rating in my rating system. As a reader of the book, let's say 3 and a half out of 5, great movie, just short of excellent, not near solid. In a person who hasn't read the book 4 out of 5, excellent movie, just missed being a solid movie!",1

BUT we do not find out why he enters the room, is this simply because the director wanted use to focus on him before the twist at the end occurred? Please tell me. It just popped into my mind once i left the cinema and i haven't been able to figure it out since, maybe u recognised it as well",1
1529,5.0,"this is the least excited i have ever been about a harry potter, well, anything. a die-hard fan myself, i have always been a bit disappointed by the movies. i mean, it is really hard to make a good movie from a worldwide acclaimed novel. but Newell could certainly have done a better job than he did. not only were all quidditch matches and house elves taken out, but key plot elements were not even explained, and i found myself having to retell the whole story to my father after the showing. sure, the aesthetic elements and cinematography was great, but ya need to give us more than that! the whole thing between Ron and Hermione's feelings for each other was completely exaggerated in the yule ball scene, as they end up screaming at each other towards the end, which i seem to remember being more subtle in the book. i didn't even realize until i got home that there weren't really any scenes of the kids actually doing any kind of school work, which is what Rowling does best in her writing, perfectly balancing intrigue and possible romance with the humdrum school life. instead, Newell put major emphasis on the three friends hitting puberty and finding the opposite sex attractive and less on magic. don't get me wrong, that stuff is fine, but c'mon, its just harry potter. Barty Crouch Jr. never gets to explain completely how he got harry to the graveyard, and we never see the true effect on Rita Skeeter's articles in the daily prophet, nor do we find out she is in fact an animagi. i thought the acting was quite good (the kids are really coming into themselves, and Michael Gambon was great), but the film was really unsatisfying. make two movies if you have to! i would wait, wouldn't you?",1

Sure there were some aspects of the book that had to be cut out due to time constraints, but I don't feel that the missing scenes impaired the final product at all. I'll admit that I did miss the rest of the Weasley clan. I was looking forward to meeting the actors who would play Charlie & Bill. I even missed Percy! And just where was Molly? She was supposed to be there to support our boy Harry. Congrats to everyone involved and I hope that they continue to do justice to this wonderful series of adventures.",1
1531,5.0,"I love the Harry Potter books and discussing these books w/my son. We have also loved the movies, through PoA. However, this movie left out the underlying plots of the movie. These are the plots that tie all of the relationships of the characters. It contained fantastic scenes and special affects, but I think concentrated too much on the teenage angst issues and not enough on the suspense, the mystery, of the story. I don't want to include spoilers, so I am being vague. But, in the movie, we never really learn how the whole story fits together, like we do in the book. I agree, also, that the story is extremely disconnected. Those who have not read the book will have a difficult time understanding what is happening.

1533,8.0,"very good, but still doesn't quite do the book justice. The movie has excellent music, the acting was better than its predecessors, great scenery, action, dialogue, humor,mood, effects and such. However, there's still room for improvement. the character of dumbledore was altered for the worse. Gambon's a fine actor, but harris was better. this dumbledore was somewhat meaner and briefly manhandled harry after his name emerged from the goblet, which we know he would never do, as he told umbridge in book 5 when she caught harry running from his D.A. session and used Marietta for info. the dragon scene, good though it was, went rather overboard. some of the death eaters (lestranges)should have been introduced, they should have had some of the qudditch world cup game at least(i mean, that's the whole original reason they're at that field), most of the newspaper satire and S.p.e.w. were edited out, which do add somewhat to the story and give it more moral, which is a good reason why the book is so great. The graveyard scene, though good, needed the most work, because wormtail, who is a real coward and a whiner, hardly flinches when he cuts off his hand, and the scene was really rushed, as it left some gaps in the information that was necessary in the books, and voldemort is supposed to draw it out and savor his joy at being in his body again. although it missed numerous things, it's still very good.",1
1534,6.0,"I really think the recent Harry Potter movie was very disappointing. I went with a die hard HP fan and he actually hated it, I give it a lil more credit. The formula for the movie seems to the same for the HP movies. It's the same sequence in the events, the events just change. I especially noticed that in this, the movie felt rushed and choppy. This may be due to the 800 pages or so, they had to squish into a 2.5 hr movie, which seemed very long. The special effects seemed just OK, like the other ones. The acting was also very mellow dramatic. I really like the third one, because of the contrast of greys and blacks, and interesting light. It was also very dark, which it should be. This was just a comerical dive with one point: get the point across, and impress the viewers. When did movie making become like that. It should be about breaking new grounds.Some things i did like include the were the light jokes, and the underwater scene, and not to mention and unbelievably hot Emma Watson (take it from a teenager). So kinda let down :/",0

Goblet of Fire, although flashy and fun for a Harry Potter fan, falls short of the mark set by the first three books and disappoints the book it is based on.",1

This movie seemed more real, with more down to earth characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone, no matter the age. It was an all around excellent way to spend a Saturday.

One thing that bothered me about the movie was the acting. While the adult actors hold their own, the (now) young teen actors leave a lot to be desired. Granger is not really playing a role as much as she is looking nice for the camera and Potter seems to be tiring of his role. Grint on the other hand (who played Ron) really impressed me with his maturing talent as an actor. Well done, Grint! The special effects are fantastic and well integrated into the action of the film. Also, there are few continuity errors that I noticed. I was, however, upset at the lack of attention given to the rest of the school year (You know, the part that DOESN'T involve the tournament), and some events of the film weren't fully explained.

There are always going to be people who pick apart the movies for the bad points, and never actually look at the movie for the good. These ""bad points"" should not detour anyone from seeing this movie, as it is an exceptionally great movie. I was surprised with some of the plot twists that were not in the book, but it all fit. Yes, there were things from the book that weren't portrayed on film, but that is to be expected. This movie covered the important plot points from the book, it was exciting, it was funny, it was superb. I highly recommend seeing this film, this is by far the best Harry Potter movie to date.",1
1549,9.0,"though, the movie leaves out large portions of the book, it still manages to capture the essence of the story. as a die-hard potter fan, i was very disappointed with the previous three movies. this one pays great attention to all the important elements of the book and captures them in fine cinematic style.while the Weasly twins (the best characters in the entire series) get good enough coverage, the screen time given to Snape, Hagrid and Sirius is far too less. still, a great visual treat characterized by fine acting by all the protagonists, who seem to have grown into the roles. a special praise for Emma Watson, who is outstanding as Hermione. Gambon as Dumbledore is still far too insipid compared to the fantastic portrayal by the late Richard Harris. the highlight of the movie is undoubtedly, Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody/ Barty Crouch Jr. he brings a great deal of subtlety to the role and is a delight to watch. Mike Newell has done a stupendous job in bringing to life , arguably the most demanding book of the series so far. definitely one for the DVD collection of every Potter fan.",1

1551,10.0,"I am in two minds about this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is a truly magnificent movie with absolutely brilliant Special Effects and all, but it was somewhat a let down throughout. A lot was cut from the film and, while I can cope with that and get over it, the whole film seemed rushed. The scenes were shorter with less detail and seemed to skip to the next scene too quickly for my liking.",0
1552,7.0,"Way to short. Would have been excellent if more of story could have been added,as a fan I would have rather seen a longer movie or even a second installment. The actors were good Emma Watson did well. Grint was wonderful as Ron, Dan was not as good of an actor in this one as he was in PoA. This movie would have been my favorite if it had just been long enough. The visuals were stunning, but I also missed a lot of the magical settings of the first three movies. It was darker by far but much less magical.I missed the fantasy magic of the other movies, and the pace was so fast it was like they were racing to the end. The story was so stuffed, trying to get every thing in that it was at times difficult to savor.",1
1553,10.0,"Besides the fact that I enjoy immersing myself into the Harry Potter books, I am an English teacher and appreciate the Harry Potter series for getting non-readers to read. One thing that I've found with the first 3 movies is that they do not do justice to the books. I was so disappointed with Azkaban that I didn't even finish watching it. I went to The Goblet of Fire not expecting to like it. Boy, was I wrong! It was by far the best movie of the 4 AND the one that followed the book most closely. The special effects in this one, at times, had me oohing and ahhing like a child! Kudos to this new director for making this movie the best one yet!",0
1554,3.0,If you are a fan of the Harry Potter Books and especially the Goblet of Fire you will be disappointed by the the theatrical release of the Goblet of Fire. So many parts of the book were left out that needed to be there.,0
1555,4.0,"I was disappointed by the movie. I think that Warner Brother should have invested a little more time, money and efforts. Special effects were poor to say the least. The actor playing Dumbledor is not well suited for the role or badly directed. Professor Moody's makeup and costume makes him look kind of cheap. The castle's design was really impressive in the 3 first movies; in this one it looks dull. The arrival of the chariot and boat of the other schools is really not impressive. Important scenes are missing, for example, it would have been really enjoyable to see each participant's fight against the dragons. With a better script and high quality special effects, Harry's fight against the dragon could have been a really great scene. I left the theater thinking Warner Brother wanted a maximum profit with minimal investment.",0
1556,10.0,"The greatest of the ""Harry Potter"" series of movies, but the saddest, also. I will keep seeing it on and on, without getting bored not once. The actors are great and the special effects extremely well made. A few changes from the initial story-line in the book, but not too many, which makes ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" one of my newest favorite movies ever.",1
1557,10.0,"The fourth film in the blockbuster Harry Potter fantasy franchise has Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) facing his greatest challenge yet when he's mysteriously picked to compete in the prestigious Triwizard Tournament, a thrilling international competition that pits him against older and more experienced students from Hogwarts and two rival wizarding schools in Europe. Meanwhile, supporters of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), called Death Eaters, send a shockwave of fear throughout the wizard community when their Dark Mark scorches the sky at the Quidditch World Cup, signalling Voldemort's return to power. But for Harry, this isn't the only news causing him anxiety -- he still has to find a date for the Yule Ball. AND ALL THAT JUST IN 2AND A HALF HOURS!!! THIS IS THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR!!! I WOULD GIVE 10 VOTES JUST FOR THE SCENE IN A BATH !!! lol THAT IS HILARIOUS!!!",1
1558,10.0,"The first two Harry Potters sucked. They felt like stage plays from a school. Prisonerof Azkaban was a big step in the right direction and made me think this series can actually be grand. I went in to see Goblet of Fire and I loved it. It's probably the best of all the films and the most realistic. The acting by the three actors is decent and getting much better as they get older and the script is decent, though leaving a lot of stuff out of the books. The special effects also are amazing to look at and the best of the films.",1
1559,5.0,"I like this movie/book series a lot. I thought each movie was getting better and better. The third was really great, and had a cool dark/gritty feel to it, and everything flowed nicely in it. In this one, I think the director really was just a bad pick.",1
1560,8.0,"I'm not a Harry Potter fan but with the plot and its excitement in the movie, I give it a thumb up. It's entertaining, excitement and full of imagination. A dragon fight, an underwater sequence and skin-crawling set pieces as the dark Lord Voldemort rises again. It's full of terrors and unexpectedness. Harry, as usual, has bigger things to worry about. His name has been mysteriously entered in the surprisingly dangerous Triwizard Tournament, a series of tasks that appears to lead him in the direction of the dark Lord Voldemort. Steven Kloves' screenplay doesn't make this path particularly clear  a pitfall, perhaps, of turning a 752-page tome into a feature-length movie. But the movie still immerses you in a sense of place and magic that builds its own kind of momentum.",1
1561,8.0,"I'll admit, I was there waiting in line with other hopeful fans last night for the opening of Potter. Despite being completely let down by the previous three films, my eternal optimism found me once again standing shoulder to shoulder with six year olds in capes and scarves and frantic mothers insisting that there was no time for candy right now. And, for the first time, Potter succeeded in making the whole ordeal worth it.",1
1562,5.0,"There is something wrong with the HP serial. The forth movie along arouses nothing but boredom. I didn't expect breathtaking script twists, since the story was known clear beforehand. But the acting, the camera-work, the movie arrangement, the atmosphere-all that makes a movie worth watching-EVERYTHING is missing as well! The narration is scattered into a number of badly tied together episodes ; almost all episodes by themselves live nothing in memory, except for the marvelous scene in the bathroom (where poor Harry is impudently harassed by a horny ghost-girl.)",0
1563,9.0,"The big problem this film had to start with was dealing with a huge book and reducing it to a suitable length for film. An early option considered was to split it into two films, but this was scrapped. The editing of the story is necessarily savage, but has been done in such a way that it sill makes sense of itself. Nevertheless, it is part of a sequence, and viewers who might not have seen the other films might be left confused about some details. So much good stuff in the book has had to be snipped.",0

1566,10.0,"Wow! In my opinion its the best Harry Potter film so far. Its funny, well written and all the actors were very good. Mad Eye Moody was brilliant in the film. The eye was very well done (i was expecting it to be poor). Michael Gambon gave a good performance as Dumbledore (again i was expecting him to be awful). The Yule Ball was brilliant, everyone was really pretty & handsome in their dress robes. Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley to perfection and was really funny. The maze was very eerie and so was the 2nd task. Ralph Fiennes was superb as Voldemort and his appearance was very similar to what i imagined it would be. Very creepy, pretty scary too, (i wouldn't want to meet him alone on a dark night). I'm glad that his appearance wasn't spoilt in all the hype before the film. The music for the film was excellent too and really made the film.",1
1567,6.0,"The movie was not what I expected, so I was very disappointed. It felt that it was very choppy, there was no continuity from movie/book 3. A lot of the emotions that I wanted to see in Harry and Ron were missing, you can barely tell that they are not talking in the beginning of the movie. The Quittich world cup scene was way to short and there was nothing of Dobby and Winky, Rita Skeeter, and Victor versus Harry/Ron over Hermione. Dumbledore was more of a joke than a strong wizard. No Sirius, Mrs. Weasley, no Mrs. Diggory. I feel that while it was visually wonderful, it lacked the emotional feel of the other three movies. The new director made a movie about the Triwizard tournament and unfortunately, nothing else.",0
1568,6.0,"may contain spoilers! Goblet of fire, great acting, fantastic effects, interesting dialog but no segues. What should have been a grand sweeping story about the deadly dangerous Tri-wizard Tournament was anything but.

I would have given another half an hour of my life for the segues that were needed, even the seasonal changes that were in the other three.",0

1571,9.0,"I really enjoyed this installment. I think the actors are getting better with each movie and the director did a great job with the special effects. I know that it is really hard to take such a long book and condense it down for a movie, but I really felt there were key elements left out... especially the house elves and Sirius. I think it will be hard to add them back into the story when they become an essential part of the story in OotP and HBP. Maybe they just couldn't get Dobby to sign on to another film.=-) I loved the movie, Mad eye was great, Voldemort was perfectly awful, Cho CHang is as beautiful as I imagined her to be, and as hard as it is to like Snape at all after reading HBP, I thought he was hilarious in this film. Fleur was a bit disappointing, as was not seeing what Bill Weasely looked liked. If Bill looks anything like the Weasley twins, I think we are in for a hottie! (who knew they'd end up so cute!) ALl in all, I loved it. Worth the wait.",1
1572,1.0,**** I never liked Harry Potter 1 and 2 but part 3 was great!!! **** Everything what I Liked about Harry Potter 3 is ruined! The special effects was good but the action isn't! First of all Daniel Radcliffe is a great actor there is nothing wrong with that! But the stunts that he must perform was a little NON realistic! I can't say that no one like the stunts he perform some people admire him but not me!!! I am not gonna spoil anything for you! It isn't a movie like the third part! But again something different! Like all new directors do! In this case Mike Newell! ,1
1573,8.0,"Okay, I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I loved this movie, BUT there were some key points that I felt missed the mark. First and foremost, I truly think that Michael Gambon is not capturing the true essence of Dumbledore. Gambon's emotional performance (too much so at times) lacks the strength and compassion that Richard Harris so effortlessly exhibited. Also, the way they chose to create Sirius's image in the fire is definitely not how it is described in the book. That along with the lack of his presence in this movie, was a big disappointment. I also would have liked to have had someone comment in more detail about Neville's parents, and the pain he's gone through. It seems as if those who have not read the book will not have the same connection with Neville's character and vulnerabilities. The last subplot that I feel was sorely missed was that of the triwizard tournament winnings (the money) and Harry's choice of where to spend it (or give it). This is a subplot that leads to so many other important connections, that if they are all eliminated for the next movie, we fans will be greatly disappointed. They SHOULD present the next movie in two parts. It's just too much good fun to cut out!!!",0
1574,7.0,"I think this movie has too many pieces stitched together, some are good and some are bad. I understand that cutting some details from the book is OK but cutting the important one is not. The three most important scenes that need to be included were the three tasks from all the champions, not just from Harry Potter. The first task they only showed how Harry got his golden egg, and completely ignored how Cedric, Victor and Fleur got theirs. People only saw how Harry overcame his dragon and thats it. They have no idea how other competitors do and therefore they couldn't compare it to how Harry did it. The excitement of the tournament is to show how all 4 champions compete against each other, not just how Harry completed his task. The second task is really good compared to the first task since we were able to see competition. The third task was a major disappointment. All they showed were a twister... at least they should included the sphinx and how Harry and Cedric competed. According to the movie, the third task is the easiest since they only run for like 5 minutes and saw the cup and run towards it. I didn't see any obstacle or anything while the third task is supposed to be the hardest,the most important task of all. I felt really disappointed after seeing the movie since it was evidently rushing and skipping lots of important details about the three main tasks.",0
1575,10.0,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is like the best movie ever. Daniel Radcliffe is like so good in the movie. It was kind of confusing but it was still the best one yet. Anyone who doesn't go see it is crazy. And anyone who thinks it stinks is even more crazy. Emma Watson looks so pretty when she goes to the dance. Ron finally tells that he like Hermine. Rupert Grint looks so ridiculous when he goes to the dance. It is so sad when Cedric dies. It is kind of sad when that girl says no to Harry. She was like so stupid i would have said yes any time any day. That guy with the glass eye is so weird. Dumbldor is like so extremely awesome.,1
1576,10.0,"Since the first book came out way back when I have been in love with the Harry Potter series, and when the movies started coming out I loved them even more! The first and second movies were very good for the time, the actors were all so young and cute and it fit for the movies. Then came third movie, and that too was amazing, although I was disappointed on the lack of following the book, but the fourth movie was outstanding. The visual effects, the accuracy, the acting, everything was amazing. Each of the actors, Daniel, Rupert, and Emma have grown into themselves, and found how to incorporate their personalities to each of the characters. Even the newest actors, all seem to gel very well with the veterans. The chemistry was amazing in the movie. You can tell how everyone got along, and it shone through on screen. By far the fourth movie was the best and I highly recommend seeing it.",1
1577,6.0,"Dear Harry Potter fans,",0
1578,,"***LOTS OF SPOILERS*** (how can you give examples of the movie's greatness without spoilers?) One thing I loved about this movie is that you can see the development of teenagers very clearly, especially with Harry. Upon asking Cho out, he slobbers all over it and she doesn't understand him; when he's dancing with Parvati at first he gets nervous and doesn't want to take her waist; when he's on the Hogwarts Express, he finds the trolley to buy some candy, but sees Cho there and is completely lovestruck - he falls back into his seat with a hypnotized smile (perfectly played by Daniel Radcliffe).",1

1581,6.0,"There were moments of brilliance in this movie. The major event scenes (triwizard challenges, yule ball, quidditch world cup, and graveyard scene/return to Hogwarts with Cedric) were fabulous, and I can't say enough good things about them. The rest of the movie was an inane, rushed and muddled attempt to connect these scenes together.",0
1582,7.0,"The minute I began watching ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" I was immediately drawn to it. When I saw the snake beginning to slither towards the mansion, I knew right away that the movie was going to be dark, yet entertaining. The change in direction was different and refreshing. The movie was excellent, yet it was not completely flawless.",1
1583,10.0,"Goblet of Fire was a good movie, but I felt that it could have been really brilliant. After reading the book I thought that the Quidditch World Cup, along with a few other scenes were pivotal. In the movie the Quidditch World Cup goes by way too fast. I think that the movie would have been way better if they had shown the actual match. It would have been hands down the best scene of all the Harry Potter movies. Also I was deeply upset with Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes is a brilliant actor,but they needed to make him look horrific and they failed miserably. In the novel he is said to have scarlet colored eyes, and they are said to be catlike. In the movie they are blue. These little detail slips took their toll in my opinion. Another thing that chapped my ass was the beginning. The scene with the graveyard and Voldemort killing the muggle caretaker was brilliant, but it completely left out Harry being at his uncles house like the novel. It starts with him at the Weasleys home, awoken by Hermione from a bad dream. That greatly hurt the story in my opinion since they left out maybe 25 vital minutes of the actual story. I understand they had to cut time since the movie was already 21/2 hours, but they coulda taken some time from the Yule Ball to aid this. That scene was way overdone. Overall this was probably my 3rd favorite behind Prisoner of Azkaban and Sorcerors Stone. IT could have been brilliant too...sigh",1
1584,6.0,"Having read all six in the series and owing the first three films on DVD, I can say that this film depends on the audience familiarity with Rowling's world. It is visually beautiful, and we are able to witness the development of each character in a way that is true to the actor..",1

1586,9.0,Very well done altogether but as one previous reviewer did point out the following important omissions: *) No Hermione catching Rita skeeter in a jar this is very important as she is indebted to Hermione to do Harry an interview in the 5th movie.,1
1587,6.0,"OK, This Harry Potter installment was a biggie. There was a lot of things going on at once which i believe is very hard to portray in only a 2 and 1/2 hour movie. From the Beging this Movie is constant action. It puts us directly into the story without warning. So much of this constant action leaves little time to explain what is going on. This movie left out many key characters or doesn't give characters enough time to be in the movie. The Dursleys are not in the movie at all neither is Leudo Bagman and of course Winky. Also I believe that Sirius should have been in the movie more for he is now very close to Harry, as well as Harry's friends Ron & Hermione. I felt that they spent little time in the movie also. Draco was left out in the cold for this one. He only participated in the scene with the ferret (though that was a great scene). Some themes were also left out that I would have liked to see but it is understandable that something have to be cut out.I believe they should have definitely put the involvement of Rita Skeeter being a Animagius as well as more of the Quidditch World Cup and the Winky subplot. Besides the movie lacking some important characters and points I felt it lived up to the others standards. The Triwizard Tournament was extremely compelling and exciting. The Look and Visual effects were again amazing and the acting also extremely well done. So All in All i believe that the director did a pretty good job in fitting in so much into one movie. Though I would have like to see more, Such as the characters I mentioned as well as other themes and parts of the book I found important the look of the movie was flawless as well as the acting. My advice to The Movie Crew of GoF is to focus more on the whole story (not just Harry, though he is very important) and to slow things down not try and fit everything in at one movie but maybe extend the movie. Also put a lot of deleted scenes & extra content on the DVD and I think well be good ",1
1588,9.0,"Being a Harry Potter fan from the first time i read the book, i knew i would like this film. But not like this... This is something extraordinary, something breathtaking. I liked the first three movies too, but this one stands out. Then Why? Chris Columbus, who directed the two first movies, practically drowned them in grease, while Cuarcon drowned his movie in visual effects. Newell, however, adds the darkness that Potter deserves. Both Harry himself and the story have become more adult, simply. Newell understands Harry like none of the other directors did. Simply, Newell is the first to take Harry seriously. He also made the characters a lot more interesting, which gives the actors more room to act, especially Mr. Radcliffe, who practically grinned himself through the first movie, but now makes Harry come alive. His Colleges, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also reaches new heights. The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Brendan Gleeson as professor Mad Eye Moody (or Barty Crouch, if you like). The film Is a bit messy in the beginning, but the ending is just incredible. Ralph Fiennes is marvelous as Lord Voldemort and Diggorys death scene is about the strongest I've ever seen. Young or old, man or woman, SEE THIS MOVIE!!",1
1589,10.0,I have been waiting for this movie for a year. It is th fourth adaption to the Harry potter series. It is the greatest one yet. It starts with Harry at the burrow then to the Quidditch world cup. then their on the train back to Hogwarts and then the arrivals of Beaxbatons and Durmstrang. then the next day the choosing of the champions. And then on to the task. their is also the Defense Against the dark arts class.then at the end of the movie its got the return of the villain VoldermortRalp Phiennes. the fight and then he return to Hogwarts and alerts the crowd. It is very sad at the end but the whole movie is very intense. It is excellent film.,1
1590,,"To see this movie makes us begin of less the previous delivery done by Alfonso Cuarón. Without being chauvinists, we might say that of work actoral there is little or nothing hereabouts. Harry only does grimaces and gets angry (without very much success) Hermione overacts and Ron spends his time showing his grunge look. It is not possible to say, nevertheless, that it is a mediocre production: the special effects, the production of wardrobe, everything is impeccable. Nevertheless, how effective can it be all that if it the principal part (the acting work) is depressing? Apparently, the fact of turning Harry Potter's rear into a gentle exemption(franchise), is beginning to lose the essence of the novels. A magic, dark world and often slightly ceremonious ... I quite dress from the point of view of a child who is growing with the spectator. We hope they does not forget, to the producers, the matter this. On the other hand, Cuarón has not disdained to return to work for the Warner, if they propose it, clearly. We really pray for it.",0

I've read the book three times and knew all the details, but for those who have seen only the film it was harder to understand.

For the die-hard Harry Potter fans (like me), they will be so deep into the movie, you can barely get them back to life. Unless you've decided to be anti-potter, this movie will take you to another world, and let you feel like you're part of a certain character.

There were so many parts of the book that were glossed over or ignored that would have actually added to the enjoyment of the film, that I am at a loss to understand why the producer felt these omissions to be necessary, I can only presume that the producers and production staff would rather satisfy the requirements of the cinema owners than the wishes of the viewers.

1599,,"This is a good film. The problem is, it could have been a great film. Of the series to date this film above all fails to do justice to the magic of the book. There was simply too much there to cram into 157 minutes and while some may be convinced that you can strip away non essential plot lines, conversations and events, what you inevitably get is a frame without substance and feeling of frustration. Certainly the action scenes are very well done. Daniel Radcliffe handles a very difficult role with a maturity belying his age and Emma Watson is superb in the few scenes in which she is stretched. So why am i not raving about how brilliant this movie is? The truth is, that in making this movie the director has given us something to enjoy, but i can't help but feel sad for the pages we have lost.",1
1600,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an awesome movie. Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Harry extremely well. He conveyed the anger, stress, frustration, confusion, joy, and all the other emotions Harry feels throughout the movie and book. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also did a fabulous job as Ron and Hermione. The chemistry between the three of them was completely realistic. The rest of the cast are equally talented. The writers cut out a lot from the book for time reasons, but as a whole the movie flowed pretty well. It definitely was nowhere as good as the book, but what is? And it was pretty good for a movie, even though it definitely could have been better.",1
1601,10.0,"Newell and the actors and actresses did a great job in the fourth sequel of hp movies. the special effects were good also. but the greatest part is the drama scene of which is limited in the first three movies. you can feel the emotions gushing through the characters, its like you were watching the real harry, Ron, Hermione, and others come to life. i can say that of all the hp sequel this one really astounded me, it seems that everyone said the movie was great after when they finish it. all in all it was the excellent film of this year. i could say that the editing was correctly, apparently the director was religious in following the author, he didn't omit important scenes but at the same time he tried to show the true essence of the story. this movie proves that this not just about magic and war, here you can say that hp is an emotional yet a satisfactory movie for both male and female may he/she be young or old",1
1602,6.0,"HPGOF - being a avid listener of the unabridged books read by Mr. Dale,I believe the movies are a disappointment and a way to make more money off the stories. I am not criticizing the work done to create the films, but what has HP become ? Each one of the books has critical character development and story line complexity that is is sorely missing from the movies. I have to wonder if JKR really has 100% creative control. If the movies are a ""coming alive"" version of the books, than why does JKR spend so much time in character development in the books, just to have it lost ? why doesn't she just write the screen play for her last book instead. I found the rewriting of the GOF to fit a movie, just an disservice to JKR work. One change that works for GOF is Nevel's role. But that was done to eliminate Dobbie's appearance in the movie. Nevel's role was better in the book with the finding out about his parents and their fight with Voldemorte. He is a character, not a device to move the plot. In retrospect, I think a mini series done for TV with all the details would have been a tribute to JKR than the way these films are butchering HP.",0
1603,4.0,"Honestly, I do not see where the praise for this movie comes from. I found the acting decent, the direction sloppy, the effects adequate, and the screenplay horrendous. It more or less fell into every trap the film version of ""Azkaban"" did.",0
1604,6.0,"Yeah... this movie ought to have been two parts. When I heard they were originally planning to do it as two movies, I celebrated and danced about my pile of Potter paraphernalia in an orgy of movie bliss. When I found out later that they had decided to cut it down to one film, I sighed and lamented all the cool sub-plots that would undoubtedly be left out of said movie.",0
1605,10.0,"Wow. The special effects are GREAT in this movie. Harry's flying actually looks a tad bit realistic (although we all know it's not! :(). The actors are great, especially Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson.",1
1606,9.0,"I loved all! The trio is just getting better by the movie. I love how Emma Granger is aging. She is turning into such a beautiful young women, and that really shows in the movies. Rupert Grint is also improving. His acting gets more animated, more ridiculous, and more personal in every movie. And Danial. Where to begin? His character has turned from a cute little boy, to a complex and amazing character, and he has done more than just keep up with the change. The new characters were just as good, though. There were two I was particularly pleased with, and many I still enjoyed seeing. The special effects were amazing. In a movie with three bit CGI sequences, passable is not an option. I especially loved the first talk, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. I would have liked to see more sub-plot from books, for instance SPEW, and the half-giant crisis. Also more Rita articles. But the movie is still excellent. One more thing- I think the ending was too long and climax too short, but you might have different opinions. Overall, I loved it, and it was the best yet.",1
1607,5.0,"This is definitely the best Harry Potter Movie made. I hope the same director is doing the next one because he has done a great job. The movie starts kinda rushed. its like the first 5 chapters of the book done in 5 minutes.. but I guess thats alright, it slows down once they get to hogwarts. They had to skip a lot of course being such a long book, but you kinda of get the feeling its missing something. You don't really get enough of the characters just talking or being with each other, so you don't care about them all that much. This movie seems a lot easier to understand then the last one, for people who haven't read the books I mean. The special affects were really good and the humor they added is funny. The score is really good I might get the soundtrack. overall i'd say this is the best harry potter movie made yet.",1
1608,7.0,"Harry Potter has always been my favorite books. But the movies are awful. The Chamber of Secrets and the Sorccers Stone those movies were OK not bad Chris Columbus did a fine job. But Alfonso Cuaron what was he drunk when he made that movie it sucked completely how stupid he screwed up everything it was stupid and confusing Harry got his broom at Christmas not at the end of the movie. And there were no shrunken heads either and the actors what happened to Tom the inn keeper it was very stupid in my opinion. The Goblet of Fire as not what I expected there were no house elves no Dursleys, not a lot of Severus Snape whom which is my favorite character and whom I love it was bad i guess Voldemort was good though Ralph Finness he played good. Now Narnia is the movie to watch excellent i give ten stars for that movie perfect Tilda Swinton excellent White Witch Queen Jadis best movie of 2005",0
1609,3.0,"Are you kidding me???? I liked when Alfonso and Chris directed this series, but Mike took the script and used it as toilet paper. Although the beginning was SOMEWHAT interesting, if he directs this series AGAIN, I will never see another Potter film again... Harry is once again at Hogwarts, as if you've never heard that one. Harry spends his days screwing around, while Ron and Hermione feud. (what a good friend he is; he cares so much about his friends that he don't give a crap!) Harry saves the day, as if only the put-on-a-pedastal hero could. They put so much emphasis on Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldemort, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are just Robin, Bat-man's sidekick. They should've really given Ron and Little Miss Know-It-All some spotlight, like in 1-3. Save your money and order it on-demand. (I don't think that you should waste $9.95... No offense, I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, and I absolutely LOVE Daniel, Emma (cutie!!!!!), and Rupert, but I hate Mike's work on this series and I am going to begin a protest to get him out of the director's chair, and into McDonald's at 5.00 an hour..",0
1610,5.0,"When Harrys name comes out the goblet Dumbledore is NOT supposed to ram Harry into the wall or shout at the top of his voice! He is NOT Irish either, i hope that they change his clothes too, why did they change the robes and clothes that the old actor did? Micheal Gambon should stay as the ugly french detective and stay away from the calm and kind Dumbledore. The film is very rushed and the dragon scene is all wrong and should have been cut short, the dragon was supposed to be on a chain, overall i think all Potter fans should be disappointed at the state of the film. However i don't think its as bad as the previous film and has a story you can follow which is why i've rated it 5.",0
1611,9.0,"i thought it was a very good movie which i enjoyed a lot. and i liked how it was very clear in what was going on and all the mysterious things that make people are supposed to think about stay mysterious until the end when everything unwinds. i was very shocked when i saw Cedric Diggory die so quickly, i honestly didn't think that there would be a twist so sad and unexpected. it almost made me cry when i saw Cedric Diggory's dad run to the body and started crying and harry wouldn't let go. the only downside the the harry potter series is that in the books harry is cool and not so weired about everything but in the movies they make him look like a nerd with geeky friends. but overall i like it all and enjoy watching the movies and reading the books.",1
1612,5.0,"I knew I would be disappointed before I saw this movie. I know there are time constraints and everything but it took them two years to make this movie and it could have been better. Alfonso did a better job on the third movie than Mike did on this one and believe me I was disappointed with the third movie also. I will say that they have an amazing special effects team because that's the only thing that kept me in my seat. Why make a film from a book if you can't even get it right? I am glad that the directorial job will be passed to a different person on the next film. I hope he does a better job. I am sorry to see that Steve Kloves isn't writing the script on the next film though, even though I am appalled at his job on this movie. They added way too much and left just as much out. The Directors are taking too much artistic license but the story is already there, the art is already there they just need to bring it to life. I guess they are assuming that everyone who goes to see them have read the books. Oh well...",0
1613,10.0,"BEST MOVIE OUT YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This has to be the best performance for all the roles in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint come together again for this excellent movie. A perfect pair and a perfect match. You have to see this movie. Just like the other many hits I'd have to say that this is one of the best. I really didn't like the 2nd movie. My favorite are the 1st, 3rd, and fourth!!! HARRY POTTER ROCKS!!!!! Emma Watson has preformed exceptionally and Daniel again wonderful. Rupert Grint puts a little comedy twist. A great welcome to all the many other characters and those new. You will be overwhelmed before the climax. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT! WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, SPLENDID!",1
1614,4.0,Hey guys I'm new to this whole site(about 30 seconds actually)So I thought that seeming that I'm a die hard Potter fan the first film I would give my sledge to would be the latest HP movie the first thing that comes to mind is obviously rushed E.g:we go from Harry at the Burrow to the Qudditch world Cup to the muggle attack to Hogwarts in barley 15 scenes(thats not a precise count)It all just seems to fast to many things missed out on Really I just that the HP directors should take Peter Jacksons approach and give it a little bit of slack to make up for the detail and plot I wouldn't mind staying in a cinema 4 an extra hour to see a bit more of the plot All up a 700 pg or more book with the detail that J.K Rowling puts in should not try to be squeezed into a 2hr period,1
1615,7.0,"I hate hearing people say things like ""I am without doubt THE BIGGEST fan"" or ""Nobody likes it as much as I do"". Therefore, I try as hard as I can not to stoop to saying things like this but I must say when it comes to J.K.Rowling's series of magical tales about Harry Potter, the boy who lived, I find stopping myself from saying irritating boasts like this increasingly difficult. Obviously I cannot possibly be the biggest fan of Harry Potter in the world but I do find myself questioning this possibility in my head and saying things like ""I can't live without it"" or ""I feel as if I am Harry's best friend myself!"" But, then the realistic part of my head tells me that I am not the only fan of the books. Half of my friends are fanatics and the whole world wait with baited breath at the release of each new film. If J.K's books were not loved like I love them by so many people worldwide, then the Harry Potter films would not have made the millions that they do not deserve. Well, maybe films one and two would have made a bit of a profit but I thought film three was a complete disaster with nothing but a good book behind it to draw in the crowds. I know how hard it is for films to live up to books, especially when they are as good as Harry Potter. But in the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, okay it might not be near as good as the book but, well it is in its own right a very good film. The usual line up are in the cast fourth time round as Harry and his friends prepare for their what will be their darkest year of their wizarding years so far at Hogwarts. This year, the Triwizard Tournament is being held in the school. This rare and major event brings students from two other wizarding schools to Hogwarts to enter their names into the Goblet of Fire to see if they can become one of the three champions to take part in the challenging tournament. The film flows very well and tells the story logically in an easy-to-follow manner(even if you haven't read the book)which its predecessors lacked. I went to see this film hoping it would bring the book to life and it did. In fact, I thought the movie was a lot better than my expectations. The acting of the young cast has improved. Radcliffe in the main role will probably never be Oscar material but he gives a brave performance in his most challenging film yet. Overall, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an enjoyable film for all ages and I would actually recommend it to the book lovers because it does in fact bring the story to life. I may not be running out stating that I am ""THE BIGGEST fan"" but like I said before you can never compare a film to a book. Especially when the book is quite simply epic.",1
1616,7.0,"First of all, a pat on the back is due to everyone involved in making this movie because there is no doubt that it would have been a huge task and it was quite well done. In this movie the students of Hogwarts have discovered the joys of puberty and the complete embarrassment and grief that it can bring you. Young Harry is faced with the looming Tri Wizard tournament and the dangers it could and most likely will bring. Harry Potter fans will notice a few main characters missing and the story slightly altered, but it's all for the good of the cinema..right? ",1
1617,10.0,"My 2 eldest boys and I went to see this last night. INCREDIBLE! I was on the edge of my seat and wasn't bored for a second. EXCELLENT adaptation of novel and (as always) exciting to see what I had in my imagination cast onto big screen. The Tri-Wizard Tournament scenes were amazing! I was seeing parts I had forgotten from the book. Wow, this HP movie is the best yet. I was just so impressed this time. I am at a loss for words. Or am I? Ugh, anyway, I don't get to see many movies since the births of my babies in the last two years. I am SOOOOOO glad I made time to see this one at a theater. I can't wait to buy this one on DVD in April! Ciao...",1
1618,9.0,"I saw the movie on Saturday night with some trepidation. I was concerned that this being my favorite book in the series that I was going to be disappointed as I was with POA. I felt that in POA even thought the acting did improve from the previous two installments, that the acting was still a little stiff, scenes were added that were either not needed (bird flying into the tree three times) or laughable (crying scene in Hogsmede), the special effects were horrible (with the exception of Buckbeak), and the core story was just ignored. That said, I thought that I was going to be very harsh on GOF for the same reasons. I am happy to report that I had none of those same complaints with this new installment.",0
1619,9.0,"I've never written a review (or anything like it), nor have I ever written a comment about a movie, so bear with me a moment. I feel I have a point to make, and it may change how you see this movie, and yes, it all depends on if you've read the books or not. I'll be honest, I only read the first book, didn't really feel an overwhelming need to read the second. Good story, good premise, just no desire. To tell you the honest truth, I am very grateful that I stopped at the first. Why? Because by reading the book, perhaps I would not have liked this movie as much as I did. You know the fans, you hear them all the time, they are not happy with the adaptation. They read the book, and are mad that a few things were left out, or this didn't get enough time, and you can't blame them. They fell in love with a story that gave precise details. What I fear has happened is that although they know the story inside and out, it has made it so they could not fully enjoy a truly masterful film. You know what I speak of, during the dragon trail, the book readers all remember what happened in the book, and it put a filter on how much they can enjoy what is on screen. It could never be done good enough. However, I did not read the book, and as I said, I am forever grateful of this. If I had, it would have taken away from the unknowingness I had going in. This movie is unbelievably tense, dark and full of poignant themes. It shows what true evil can be, it takes us back to when we were slightly younger and it lets us actually feel for the main character by ourselves. What I mean by that is, we know the characters so well, we understand them, we no longer need to have it explained. And we finally understand that by the end of this series, Harry will need to lean on those around him, because no matter how great he may be, he is nothing without those that care. I feel bad for those who come home from this picture and can't help but be disappointed. It's really not their fault; one's adaptation is another's disappointment. Yet believe me on this, this is a great film. As I put before, this is the Potter film that makes you want to see the next movie, right away. The true dark tone is finally here, the evil has finally come, and the characters are reaching the breaking point. And if you let it, this film will make you care. I don't know where the series goes from here, I didn't read the books. ",1
1620,4.0,"Judging from other reviews, both professional and every day Joe, I must be the only one who did not like this movie or how the series is progressing. I realize that they cannot put everything from the book into the movie. /Goblet of Fire/ was an immense book and to condense it to 2 and a half hours is a major feat. That being said, this movie did not flow. It felt like the story was on fast forward all the time. The movie lacks the grace of the books. It also misses the history of the characters. Facts about Harry's parents are left out entirely in all the movies. These facts make the character of Harry Potter such a wonder and powerful. Being the ""Boy who Lived"" comes with history. THe movies ignore it just for bigger and louder special effects. I went to see Goblet in the hope that the new director might try to make amends but no. I doubt I will see any of the other movies as they come out. I will delight in the books and be first in line for the next one. I know that JKR tends to have a rather boring ""explanation"" section at the end of each of her books which does not translate, but there are ways to incorporate this info into the movie. That is just my two cents.",0
1621,10.0,"This Harry Potter Movie is probably the best one yet for action, intrigue, and Special Effects. Having listened to the Audio Books, read by Jim Dale (I think ), the film varies quite a bit from the book. If a person read the book before seeing the Movie, you keep wondering when "" such and such "" will happen. There is so much rich content to the book, the movie would have to be much longer than it is. My two eldest daughters, 41 and 42, and my wife and I have seen all the movies at least once, and highly recommend any and all to be viewed. Some of the content in the G. of F. is probably a tad too intense for the younger set, but anyone who likes Magic, Wizardry, and just a very good movie must see this one. I can't wait for the next book to come out. It will be interesting to see how the actors age. No complaints on this one, it's a keeper....",1
1622,10.0,"It's the Goblet of Fire with a very competent director and a fine cast. The result is a terrific movie -- fast-paced, gripping, scary, even occasionally heart-rending. After the first two dismal Chris Columbus efforts, and the good-but-not-great Prisoner, Harry Potter has finally come into his own on film. I mean this generically about the movie -- the actor, Daniel Radcliffe, continues to serve largely as the straight man for the wonderful characters and scenes around him. Whether or not he's capable of more remains unknown, as Director Newell has shrewdly kept him within his normal, passive range and thus made more of the outlandish, magical, unpredictable, sometimes terrifying world he inhabits. A note of caution, however, there are scenes that could frighten young children.",1
1623,7.0,"Overall, I liked the film but just couldn't get over the feeling that they cut too much from the book. There were a lot of characters who didn't appear. For new characters that were included, they didn't seem to have much depth. In fact, even some of the main characters other than Harry lacked depth. This book in the series is supposed to show a major transition in the adolescent development of students, but aside from the fact that they're obviously older, so much was either minimized or left out entirely. This was inevitable given the length of the book, but even so, I felt that there was just way too much missing. I hope that they'll do an extended version with a lot more scenes added.",0
1624,8.0,"I am rating this as 8 out of 10. Like many others, Goblet of Fire was my favorite book also, at least; until book 6. I was also very disappointed that several key things were left out. Especially the scene with the maze. They left out quite a bit! But I really like how they portrayed Harry Hermione and Ron, a little awkward and so in. Overall, I think it was good, but could have been a little better. Heard they had wanted to do 2 movies for it, for 2 parts? Maybe they should have so not much would've been left behind. I would have liked to see the Dursleys again, also. Almost nothing with Sirius. I thought the effects with the dragons were nice, but would have liked to see the other champions as well.",1
1625,7.0,"I must say that I was truly disappointed by this rendition of a Harry Potter book. I've read about half of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire before seeing the movie. When I saw the movie, I disappointed to see that I had read about 5 minutes of the book! They left out many characters and details, along with the absence of the opening scene with Dudley, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia. There is also a chapter about Dobby and other house-elves, which was also absent in the movie. With Michael Gambon playing as Dumbledore, Dumbledore seems more dark and ""mean"" if you will with his style of speaking. The music orchestration was also dry since John Williams wasn't the composer for it. The main Harry Potter theme is no where to be heard in this film. The only music by JW to be heard in the movie is Hedwig's Theme, who is seen in the movie for a good minute.",0
1626,8.0,"The first time i heard about Harry Potter was a couple of years ago and i was totally disgusted by the fuss created round it. But then came the films. Needless to say that i haven't read any of the books. I saw the first film and it was rather cool, so was the second. I'm almost 18, and i must assure you that i've left behind the age of toys . The 3rd was rather scary comparing it to its predecessors. Harry Potter was complexly built, and he showed, obviously human traits. The same thing happens in ""The Goblet of Fire"", but, i prefer ""The Prizoner..."" best. People say it was Daniel Radcliffe was rather unconvincing, true, but, he inspired manhood, power and impulse. ""The Goblet"" is quite mixed up, not knowing, as a viewer what will happen next. This is the very aim of the filmmakers. In my opinion, the relationship of Harry with his friends is underdeveloped. They try some sort of a love triangle and rivalry, but all is too ambiguous. It was good film, but i'm really looking forward to seeing the sequel.",1
1627,,"I think Dan has really got the whole Harry role down! did you see the Grave yard scene. He show he can handle Harry's emotion, and bravery. Also, he show his emotions with Cho great. Dan and Rupert went at it 1/3 0f the way through, amazing. Emma and Rupert really need help showing their characters anger toward each other. Emma did her 'Hermione'thing, and Helped Dan throughout the tournament. I thought all and all the movie was a blow out, I mean it had amazing special effects and awesome acting! Dan is totally prepared for his Fith-year at Hogwarts. Emma is sort of prepared to face her Fith-year at Hogwarts. Dan can really act, I must say!",1
1628,8.0,"I found the fourth installment of HP far more interesting and entertaining than the other three. Of course things were changed from the books, as to be expected, but I feel this director did a better job than the other two, and was able to bring the story to life better. Obviously the scriptwriter and the director are assuming (wrongly) that all movie-goers have read the books, for there are important details left out that have others I have spoken with are confused about. I however, was able to follow the storyline perfectly as I knew what was happening. The children's acting has improved greatly since the last movies (although, why such horrid actors were chosen in the first place baffles me), but they still leave something to be desired in this film. The main adult actors, of course, portrayed their characters wonderfully. I was a little thrown off by Barty Crouch Jr. and the actor's way of playing him, but I do not think it ruined the movie. I was not at all pleased with the appearance of Mad Eye, or how they chose to show his magical eye. But I suppose that is just my OCD showing through. All in all this was my favorite movie, and I hope the sign this director for another installment in the series.",1

1630,3.0,OK so I started reading the HP books after the 2nd movie was released. And personally I think the first 2 were although not complete still pretty accurate for a movie and keeping the feel of the characters. But in my opinion everything went downhill when they changed directors after the second movie and Richard Harris passed away. ,0
1631,10.0,"It was more ""to the book"" than the third movie, and was very funny- mainly because of Rupert Grint, James Phelps, and Oliver Phelps. Although the Ron-Hermione relationship was not highlighted as much in this movie, the movie was still great. Each member of the trio has become a better actor. There were only a few unnecessary moments that were inappropriate for younger children. Although the movie is about two hours and forty- five minutes, the length is not noticeable, especially to a true Harry Potter fan. The movie consists of constant entertainment- there was never a dull moment. At all times, the movie was either action packed or laugh-out-loud funny. I highly recommend it to all.",1
1632,6.0,"Though this movie is well done, it STRAYS TOO FAR FROM THE BOOK. So many ridiculous changes; I can hardly believe it. For instance: The maze. Where are the challenges? OOO, I'm so freaking scared of the moving shrubbery and the, oh my gosh, WIND. It's pathetic. For this, they cut out the sphinx, blast-ended skrewts (completely out of the movie), a boggart, and a couple of other obstacles. Oh, and ""the Quidditch World Cup?"", you ask. ""Where was it?"" I ask. Where was Ludo Bagman? Where was Winky? Harry NEVER saw Barty Crouch Jr. cast the Dark Mark. On another note: Fire whoever's playing Dumbledore; HE IS TERRIBLE!!!!! Here's a minor thing, but it's very annoying: Harry and Ron's hair. Does it ever say in the book that Harry and Ron grow their hair out? Of course not! In summary, this movie could have been MUCH MUCH BETTER if it didn't stray from an awesome book.",0

1634,2.0,"I know that I have graded this movie very harshly, however, given that it is based on my favorite of the books, i can not help but feel greatly disappointed. It also does not help that this movie came on the heels of Prisoner of Azkaban, which is so far my favorite of the films, and was masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron. I felt that this movie contained almost no character development. It seems as if the characters hardly ever even converse. The movie also felt very rushed, as it offers practically no justification for what happens in it. I know that it can be difficult to cram a 700 or so page book into a two and a half hour movie, but it has been done before, and there must be a better way than this.",0

Second, Krum and Fleur got like, 2 lines each. Hello? And they're supposed to be two of the main characters? Plus, they hardly explained anything about Professor Moody, and they definitely messed up the Yule Ball. I really, really wanted to love this movie, and I waited forever for it, but I can't help being disappointed. Not as good as the others. I know a few people who saw this movie who had not read the book, and they were totally confused, because there was not enough information given. Furthermore, there were supposed to be all sorts of Magical Creatures in the maze. I kept waiting for some to appear, but they never did. However, I was impressed with the first and second tasks. They were spectacular.",0
1637,9.0,"This movie is a must-see for any Harry Potter fan, and is definitely worth seeing for all others 13 and up. While necessarily cutting out some material from the book in order to be of reasonable length, the writers chose well the scenes to appear in the movie.",1

After watching this movie, my initial thought was proven correct and I was not disappointed. The actors in the film were well fit for their role and they all played their parts well. The actors really made the movie come to life. As a child, when I watched this movie and felt completely immersed in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The emotional background in the story brings the story emotional appeal and really makes the watcher commit. I would recommend this movie to anybody that is interested in watching movies about magic and mythical creatures. If you want to awaken your inner child and set your imagination free, this movie is for you. I rated this movie 9/10 because these kind of movies aren't for everybody.",1
1639,10.0,"First off I would like to say that I did not think I would like the Potter series of books or movies because of them being childish. However my mind has been changed. This movie like the first 3 is an excellent choice for a good family fun movie. Kids 5 and up would love it. Harry is now 14 in this movie (if you have read the books year1 he was 11, year 2 he was 12 and so on). He gets put into the Tri-Wizard competition and faces some of the hardest and coolest things yet. (They are cool to me. I am not sure how Daniel Radcliffe feels.) Any way this is a cool movie as Harry moves on throughout his 4th year at Hogwarts making new friends and enemies (if you have never seen this you will never guess who). Ha Ha. You will have to watch this movie to know what I am talking about. If you like the first 3 movies you should like this one. It is my favorite out of the 4. It has suspense and mystery and fun in it.",1
1640,5.0,"I'm giving this movie a pass because I LOVED the book, and so cannot give it a failing grade completely. The movie was occasionally quite funny, and the original plot was good. I appreciate that it's hard to make such an incredibly long movie PERFECT, but did it really need to be filled with this many clichéd scenes? From the depressingly unoriginal rendition of the angst-filled teen drama that you can find in, well, any teen drama, to the overdone scenes of grieving at the end, the entire thing just seemed to me like someone took a great story and flushed it down the toilet.",0
1641,6.0,"i'm going to start by saying i really like the books. the goblet of fire has over 200 pages and i must confess it IS a great effort on the director's part to condense it into a 2 1/2 hour movie, and we do have to appreciate that. i guess i expected a little too much out of this film which is why it was ruined for me, but don't take my word for it, see it yourself.",0
1642,5.0,"I LOVE the Harry Potter books, so I was really excited for when the fourth movie came out. All of the other three movies had been great, especially the first and second, so I couldn't wait for the fourth installment. I was disappointed...Where were Ludo Bagman, Winky and Dobby? Not to mention that there were no Dursleys. Didn't Harry win 1000 Galleons at the end? Well, not in this movie, maybe only in the book...I didn't understand the whole dragon chasing Harry in the first task...Does that happen? No, didn't think so. The movie also missed a lot of scenes...You barely even get to see the Quidditch World Cup match! And why was Dumbledore man handling Harry? I don't remember anything about that in the books...Anyway, although Ron delivers some funny lines, in my opinion, this movie only deserves a 5/10. I can only hope that The Order of the Phoenix is much better than the fourth!",1
1643,6.0,"The parts from the book that were actually in it were quite well done. Sadly, those were quite few. By skipping vital parts of the book, the next movie will be skewed and the story line will not flow. For example, Rita Skeeter in the novels, is an unregistered animagus and that is how she is getting all kinds of insider information about Harry and that whole part is left out. Another example is the maze. Compared to the books, it was horribly boring. There is a sphinx, the world turns upside down and there are many other obstacles that get left out of the film. The Beauxbatons students were all wrong! There are boys who come with the girls to the school. Also, you almost never see them go to class and they showed only minutes of the Quidditch World Cup and did not show Winky (Barty's Crouch's house elf) with Harry's wand Another thing they left out was Hermione's founding of the Organization ""SPEW"". I was outraged and furious by all the mistakes and omissions in this film!",0
1644,1.0,"I thought that the film was awful. But i also felt that it didn't do the book much justice. The goblet of fire is my favourite book and there are loads of things which are explained in the book which aren't in the film like how harry got into the prefects bathroom, how he found out the accio part etc. But also other parts like the mer-people and the dragon were also quite fascinating and when Cedric got killed it was also very sad. I thought that the part in the maze was also really really good and the port key was well illustrated. The Dark Mark was a huge disappointment as was the start part and the reappearance of James and Lilly Potter Harrys parents. The quiditch world cup was fantastic and harry fighting the Hungarian horntail was to. The yule ball was wrecked in parts but Hermione looked stunning and should have her hair straight most of the time but in the book it doesn't turn into a rock concert which is what it seemed to turn into. Who on earth won the wizard world cup and also the part where harry has a rather spectacular escape which was unfortunately left out of the film. The director was rubbish and should never be able to touch another harry potter movie sirius should have been in more the flu network was extremely badly represented there was only one lesson which was not good at all the absolutely nothing in the film was explained at all. I hated the film but i would recommend it to people who cant be bothered to read the book but wouldn't recommend it to people who like the books. I dread to think how dumbledores going to react in the next film because the way he reacted when Harry's name came out of the goblet was atrocious and he wouldn't even do that to a pupil of hogwarts let alone harry. The dragon doesn't escape from the pen or his chain doesn't break and if it did then there would be people there to stop the massive chase after. The scene in the graveyard was really bad and voldermort was extremely badly interpreted. Id rate it 0 but you cant so ill rate it 1. Bitterly Bitterly Disappointed.",0

1646,10.0,"The Goblet of Fire continues the dark climate with excellence, adopted by its predecessor: The prisoner of Azkaban. Directed in a formidable and splendid manner by Mike Newell, the filmmaker manages to establish a tone of urgency, an admirable and melancholic suspense tone from the beginning of this great narrative, in addition to director of photography Roger Pratt and also the entire special effects team maintains the sky is always cloudy, grayish, with the intention of making a review of the gloomy climate, which by the way was a great positive point, which completes everything contained in this humid chapter. Another positive point is no sign of lightness seen in the first two films, showing the maturity of the saga. It is worth mentioning that the Goblet of Fire has one of the best releases in the franchise, in my opinion.",1
1647,8.0,I believe that they were doing a great movie until they started to add all of the cussing into it. I believe that you can make a movie and have it rated G in the language and have a great movie. They did it in all the other movies except for Ron now and then and they were all hits. So I think it could have been a 10 but they blew it with the cussing. I am a new watcher of the Harry Potter movies and I love the movies. It was just disappointing when they started to add all the cussing. I'm not big on ruining a movie with cussing and that makes my vote on it lower a lot. I am eagerly awaiting for the next movie to come out but I hope that they will try to go back to the G rated language.,1
1648,8.0,"This is definitely, by far, the best Harry Potter movie yet. It was my favorite book as well. It definitely wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty good, and the special effects were amazing. If you love Harry Potter, (and even if you don't) come to see this movie. It was surprisingly funny at times. It also followed the book surprisingly well. Not as well as some may like, but as much as they could do to fit a 734 page book into a two and a half hour movie, and better than any other Harry Potter yet. This movie I give Eight out of Ten stars (as you see above) because this definitely wasn't the best directed movie of the year. There were flaws at times. So if you want to go see a movie, you'd probably choose this one anyway, but let me back you up in saying that it is a good eight dollars to spend.",1
1649,10.0,"This film 'Goblet Of Fire' is the best film of Harry Potter series in my view.I am a fan of Harry Potter myself.The specialty of this film is that no scene is irrelevant.Every scene has its importance and relevance of its own now or little later.This makes it even more exciting and interesting.The suspense, thrill and horror keeps the viewers stick to the film till the end.The choice of characters is superb, specially Prof. Moory,Dumbledore And Offcourse Lord Voldemort.Their entry captures the screen.This film is also a transition period for a child Harry who is transforming into an adult magician.Everything happening in the screen has a dual purpose;one for the entire world of people and the other for..............To put in a nutshell,I had never seen a film like this before which could satisfy me completely.I wish to salute the JK Rowling And director of this film.",1
1650,10.0,"I am very lucky and happy to be able to watch this movie in the cinema, This movie has been cheering me up whenever I watch it, or whenever I hear the theme song. The graphic in this movie is still amazing even if this movie was created 17 years ago. This movie made me buying my own novel book for the first time, and inspired me to read more books in general. The actors in this movie did very well with their part, which is why I'm still going back and re-watch the whole series of Harry Potter every time I have a chance. The plot and the script of this movie were also very similar to the book. The actors in this movie also grow along with the movie, this then makes me feel like I'm a part of their journey and I'm going through with them. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was about the time that Harry got into the Tri-Wizard tournament without him signing up for it. This movie expresses different emotions throughout the series. Overall I recommend everyone to watch this movie, and for me, this one was my favorite one out of all of the movies in the whole series and I'm going to rate this movie a 10/10.",1
1651,,"I was actually very pleased with this Harry Potter film, it included a lot of the original plot line and didn't sacrifice too much of the story or details for the sake of time or simplicity. So far, this is my favorite Harry Potter movie; Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my least favorite, because it just cut out and changed waaay too much for me to enjoy, knowing how good the movie could have been (My brother saw this movie with me w/o reading the book first and he liked it, I had to explain where it went wrong). The only major complaint I had as I watched the movie (as my boyfriend lives to torture me about, since he agreed to watch the movie with me if I didn't complain about the director leaving things out/changing things/etc.) in the theater was the final task in the maze just because it was far more interesting in the book and would've looked awesome brought to life on the big screen. Don't get me wrong, the maze scene in the movie was good, but come on, to me all it seem like was a psychological battle for each of the contestants, against themselves and the bushes, where's the challenge? Where are the sphinx, blast ended-skewerts (sp?)??? After viewing this movie once more I've discovered a few things that now I wish were included, just for the sake of continuity with the next book/movie in the series (the movie is fine without these sub-story lines/scenes): Rita Skeeter's other stories (e.g. her Harry Potter is crazy story) and the Rita Skeeter is an anamaigus story line, and the whole Snape and Sirius setting aside their differences (in the short term) and going off to do their respective jobs for Dumbledor, and Harry giving his winnings to the Twns so they could open a joke shop (as well as the blackmailing storyline that went along with that).",1

But it is not that so great after all....GOF starts in a very dark tone and music scores by Patrick Doyle...The plot of the movie remains faithful to the book( around 80 percent).. The darker tone,as for me is really need in this movie to amaze the audience......and the movie ends in such a good ending..... I don't think that director Mike Newell is lazy, but there,s an important details in the book that was not included in the movie.....that makes it flushy....I will just recommend this movie for the kids and adults as one of the delightful movies of the year 2005..What will I say is that GOF is the best Potter movie,yet and I hope that Order of the Phoenix will be a lot better than the previous films.....",1

The winter ball is very beautifully played, the couples are unpredictable! There are a lot of funny moments and moments worth thinking about.

1655,10.0,"The Goblet of Fire is one of my favorite series. It is not as gloomy as the previous one, and as if it takes us back to the world of colors and adventures. However, it is also a huge twist in the plot. Here are events that cannot be overlooked, the main antagonist of the entire series of books and films manifests itself. We find out who many of the characters really are, a romantic line appears. In general, I think that everyone should watch this part!",1
1656,2.0,"A year and a half of delay to see this result, it frankly seems to me disappointing. I know very well, that is quite difficult to adapt a book to a film. The book contains an immense wealth of details, explanations, feelings, emotions, relations, etc. that is almost impossible to captured completely in a film. But I believe at least, the director and scriptwriter (who work side by side, I suppose), must know the book's plot very well, of such way, that in the adaptation it's understood perfectly, why happens each thing, which are the relations between the characters, which are the personalities of the characters, which are the important facts. Lamentably, nothing of this I could perceive in CoF. First, which has affected to me more, is Dumbledor. He didn't look in anything to the one described in books. On the contrary, he seemed old, doubtful, violent poor man (shakes Potter)fearful, ""shouting"". Who could think that he is the greatest wizard of the world? He doesn't inspire respect. On the other hand, I don't remember that Snape hit to Harry nor Ron. His mistreat always was verbal, never physical. The Wesley twins are older than the trio (Harry, Hermione, Ron) therefore, could not be in the same class with Snape. I've got the feeling that director wanted to show a lot of things from the book, but simultaneously... there is nothing. I believe that the details that appear, are not sufficient so that a person who hasn't read books can understand everything clearly what happened in the film. I think it isn't an acting problem, because the actors make enough good. In fact, I believe the kids, in general, have improved. The adult actors, I cannot either complain. The actors render what a director is able to obtain from them, according to which requires his film. Then, I believe that in this case, Mike Newell, he is the one who changed Dumbledor's personality... and it really causes sorrow to me. I feel like Newell, did not read any book of Harry Potter or simply he understood another stuff. The film, in general, entertains, it's got romance, thriller, it remembers the adolescence to you (if it's that already you passed it), has interesting special effects, casting is well, but for the people whom they like plus books, I don't believe that they like much this adaptation.",0

1658,7.0,"I suppose it's my own fault for not liking this movie. It's not an awful movie, just diverts from the authentic story line way too often, deleting completely those little clues that stump you at the end after reading, leaving you wondering ""why didn't I realize that sooner."" One of Rowling's quirks that make her books so imaginative are those little details that transport you into the world of Harry Potter as a third part perspective.

1662,6.0,"This book is one of my favorite in the Harry Potter series. The movie cut out much of it, understandably. The special effects were amazing, and what part of the story they put in was tolerable, with a couple of exceptions. For example, where on earth did they find Dumbledore!?! He is NOT the Dumbledore in the books, not even close. Where is the powerful, yet kind and soft spoken man that watches over Harry, and all the students at Hogwarts? This man is harsh, loud, and unforgiving. There were also some key script changes, especially in the last scene with Voldermort, that completely changed the plot of the story. In the end it was entertaining if you are tolerant to the script changes and a ghastly Dumbledore.",1
1663,4.0,"I have never been fully satisfied with how the Harry Potter books have been brought to the big screen, but this certainly left the most to be desired. It's a pitiful attempt of transferring possibly the best book in the series into to cinema form, with terrible screenplay which leaves out vast chunks of the story. Unless you have read the books you just cant grasp the amount left out. Showed great promise in parts but simply failed to deliver. Pros: Voldemort and his death eaters were just as I imagined. Really like the snake look of Voldemort. The Dragon Task, very tense when harry slips down the roof is very tense The Special Effects in the Film (e.g. the Quidditch World Cup Stadium) Rupert Grint who I think is perfect as Ron. Funniest part in the movie is when he dances with Maggie Smith(Professor McGonagall) The way that everyone is against Harry, Potter Stinks etc Cons: Missing out the action in the Quidditch World Cup final, was possibly the aspect I was most looking forward too. The amount of context cut out from the film, the house elf's in the kitchen etc. Sirius, or more the lack of him. Very minor role in the film, makes his passing in the next film not really matter.In the book Harry relies heavily on Sirius to pull him through the Tournament. He is probably the living person harry loves most in the books.",0
1664,4.0,"Hard to say whether this flick deserves a 4 or higher. But for a book with 750+ pages, we should've seen this a mile away that it was going to be a piece-meal of a film. Too bad they ditched the idea of making an extended version. The actual story would actually benefit from the added footage. As it is now, it skips along grabbing only the more important aspects of the Tri-wizard Tournament, making those that read the book, gaping in utter disgust as to how they butchered the story. I'm sure if they added say 20-30 minutes more, it would probably have flowed so smooth that you wouldn't have noticed that it was three hours long.",0

The movie was more like a summery of the book; everything is done swiftly, as if every word is redundant. There are many scenes where every character says only one sentence. This prevents developing of dialogues, and overall the characters development as well. There were some moments when I felt I was watching dramatizations of excerpts from the book.",0

1670,1.0,"Overall, I thought this was definitely the worst of series so far. Everything in it just seemed so crammed and rushed for time. Nothing in the movie really seemed to capture many of the exciting or interesting parts of the book. Things like the Qudditch match were just horribly short, and not even appealing to watch. As for the maze, many of the interesting tasks from the book were just thrown aside. If things like this are going to be included, I would think that it would at least be done right. I would have definitely sat through an extra half hour or more to see these things done well. The acting didn't impress me much either, but what added to painfulness of watching the movie the most was Dumbledore, whose acting I thought was just terrible at points in the film (mainly near the end). Judging by the quality of the Order of the Phoenix, I can tell that the movies will get better, and hopefully no more books will be this badly portrayed again.",0

They didn't insist upon John Williams for the 4th score, they've changed directors how many times, and they used different filming techniques. There is little continuity, though the sets of the 3rd and 4th are closer in similarity than from the first two... I realize it's a 733 page book, but they should have at least ensured that viewers would understand the plot without having read the book first. The climax was rushed, the tension not nearly as steep as the original work. They didn't supply reasons as to why certain events happened. Mff, okay that's all I have to say.",0

1677,,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an American made film with no American actors or actresses. All of the actors and actresses in the film from the UK are what most American kids, teenagers and adults can relate to, culture-wise. There were a lot of foreign characters introduced in this film, and it is interesting to see how they were portrayed. First of all, because there are no American actors or actresses, the British actors were played more like Americans. For example, in this movie they dressed differently from the book (hardly ever any robes, Gryffindor attire) rather they dressed in hip modern day clothing. Also, rather than the occasional ""bloody hell"" here and there, the dialog is very western; much slower than a traditional British film. It was interesting to see that the foreign characters such as Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour were dressed and behaved very stereotypically. These stereotypes are part of the book, but the movie really exaggerated the difference between countries. Krum dressed very ruggedly while Fleur represented kind of an ideal feminine woman. Although both of these characters had some sort of love interest from students at Hogwarts, they were still foreign and they were still the enemy. Does this say anything about the way we perceive foreigners in America? Can we draw conclusions such as this, that in America we push our traditions and values upon others and if they do not accept they are the enemy? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of my favorite movies, a box office hit and a best-selling novel but there are still social and cultural issues to be addressed.",1
1678,8.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was one of the most popular Hollywood films of the year. While the film is extremely enjoyable, it is important to take into account the cultural issues that the movie creates. HPGPF is a Hollywood film made with British actors, and therefore creates many of the same cultural biases that American film does with foreign nations. For example, we can see prevalent stereotypes of foreign nations that often appear in American made film. The French and Bulgarians are portrayed as beautiful, well build, or attractive, but are also generally taken to be stuck up or arrogant. Our hero, as well as most of the British characters, are portrayed as relatable and genuine. This bias seems to contradict the recent film trend of using more foreign actors, directors, and producers to make film. If there are so many outsiders in the film making world, why do these biases still appear? The answer lies in the simplicity of what we are viewers enjoy. Seeing these stereotypes that we are used to and understand make the movies easier for us to process. When we are American's watch foreign made film, we might be confused by the differences in film making, including, but not limited to, how indirect the messages might be, and how characters may not fall into the simple categories that we are used to.",1
1679,3.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire helps to further Hollywood stereotypes to promote Westernized images of heroes and villains.

1680,10.0,"In the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson star as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to Hogwarts for their fourth year. This time, the school hosts the legendary Triwizard tournament, introducing new friends and foes, as our main characters face another year of trials and hardships. Like the Potter films before, this film's theme focuses on the importance of family and friendship and the forces of good versus evil. In the early stages of the film, we see the students of Hogwarts not getting along. Ron is jealous that Harry is getting attention for competing in the tournament, Cedric Diggory is pitted against Harry despite them being from the same school, and Ron is jealous of Hermione's relationship with Viktor Krum. But soon the students realize there is more at stake than their arguments and winning the tournament. Something is not right and it seems that the dark forces are setting the stage for a major catastrophe. We see the friends ban together to help each other out. Cedric, Harry, Ron, and Hermione work together to figure out the tournament tasks. The events of the film's theme remind me a bit of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The four siblings in this film are often competitive and jealous of one another. The younger brother even sells out his siblings so he can become a prince. In the end, the siblings unite and fight for the greater good which is the safety and freedom of Narnians. They win battle against the White Witch and her followers with the help of their friend Aslan and good triumphs over evil. The themes good versus evil and the importance of family and friends and shows through this film as it does for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, several techniques are used to help enhance the theme. The lighting makes it clear whether the characters are in a laid back, peaceful setting or if they are in a dark, scary place, not knowing what is lurking around the corner. Good characters are seen in a white light, where followers of the dark lord, Voldemort, are often seen in dark, dim lit rooms or grave yards. Symbolism is also used in the film. Voldemort is portrayed as snake-like. In most cultures, serpents symbolize something that is considered creepy and deceitful. Wormtail, Voldemort's follower, is portrayed as rat-like. Wormtail had betrayed his friends for his own good by ratting them out. Though the film ends with a tragic event, we see the students of Hogwarts use the tragedy to pull closer together and strengthen their friendship, determined to stand and fight against the evil forces of Voldemort. The themes of good versus evil, friendship and family, rings throughout the film, to the very end.",1
1681,5.0,"I have to report a crime, a murder, the victim? A series of books shot down in cold blood that has wormed its way into the hearts of the public. It's a shame that a series that started so well has been stripped of everything that actually made the series of books enjoyable. As is common with books made into films, they have to fillet out the bits that take up screen time and send people to sleep which does cause havoc with those who've read the book, and even more so, if those greedy money makers at Hollywood strip out its heart, making it barely recognisable or only focus on one part of the story a la Percy Jackson.",0
1682,10.0,"My congratulations go to Mike Newell. Despite the length and detail of the book, Mike maintained a good degree of loyalty to the story. Granted, there were a few skips and jumps, and the speed at which the events move were clear from the outset. I read all the books a number of times, and then saw each movie just after release. My expectation was not too high, because the kind of detail contained in the books would take much more than a single movie to exploit. This was evident in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and therefore it was often difficult to keep up with the plot.",1
1683,8.0,Was better than the last one. It was still not as graphical as some of the first few. While it still missed some points it had some excellent color and demonstrations of what happened in the book. Its definitely worth seeing. ,1
1684,9.0,"Well I might over-reacted with the voting but, it is due to the fact that I am such a big fan, and also under the strength of the impressions of just returning from the movies, after taking the whole exposure to magic.",1
1685,4.0,"I know it must be very hard to make a movie based on a best-selling book, let alone a Harry Potter book. But in my opinion, they pretty much messed it up by changing the directors (Chris Columbus should have directed all the movies).",0
1686,10.0,"If you do what I do every time I sit down to watch a new Harry Potter movie, which is to separate book from movie then you will absolutely love Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. What some people must realize the amazing J.K. Rowling, is not writing the screenplay and she is not directing, so of course its going to be changed to fit into the 2 and a half hours time limit. Once you separate book from movie, you will absolutely love the movie, it is definitely the best one. Yes, the books will always be better to me, but the Goblet of Fire movie was most definitely the best movie I've seen in a long time. Although, there were some changes to the plot that did bug me, them being Voldemort's eyes weren't red. And I wish they didn't take out the whole argument at the end with Fudge, Dumbledore, Harry, etc.. I mean people who don't read the book won't know why the ministry is such a major donkey's butt in the next movie. Other than that the movie was awesome and I really love the soundtrack too.",1
1687,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Visually stunning! Breathtaking cinematography! Awesome special effects! Great costumes, particularly Lord Voldemort. Definitely the darkest so far and the beginning of a less childlike Harry Potter.",1
1688,10.0,"Being a devoted fan of the books, I feel obliged to go see each film as it comes out, but to be honest the first three as everyone knows are not amazing. Prisoner of Azkaban was a lot better than the first two, but still not amazing. Goblet of Fire was awesome!!!! It was scary, and passionate and just amazing. A lot of things from the book were not included in the film versions of the others, but this one was so much more accurate to the book!! With the pensieve and what Harry sees in it, and particularly Neville's reaction to the Cruciatus curse!! It was just wikkid. And the guy playing Krum is hot too. And Ralph Fiennes is fabulous. And Pulp are in it!!!! It didn't drag at all, they've really used the 2 and a half hrs, i couldn't believe id been in the cinema for over 2 n a half hours when it ended! Mad Eye Moody looked JUST as I had imagined from the book, so did Crouch's son. And Amos Diggory's reaction at the end!!! It was heart rending!!!!!! So yeh, go see this film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
1689,8.0,So what can I say. I found this film to be one of the funniest films of the year. I haven't laughed like I did while watching the Harry Potter film for a long time. I started laughing right from the start and didn't stop till the end.,1
1690,6.0,"To preface everything else I'm about to say, this movie was pretty decent. If you're a hardcore fan of the books, you will likely be disappointed as I was, simply because it does not follow the book very well. But, the movie alone wasn't that bad.",0
1691,10.0,"The movie, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was absolute wonderful. Full of action, humor, and emotions. It keeps you up to date and moves you along very quickly through the book. If you want to fill in the blanks, you have to read the book. The movie has Beaux Batons and Durmstrang appear suddenly without warning, and though Dumbledore explains later, the book prepares you for their arrival. The movie was well written but for the die-hard Harry Potter fans I think we can agree that it could have been longer. Even 20 minutes would have slowed down the beginning a bit and explain more. But even if you don't read the books, the movie is a MUST SEE for all. And if you have an IMAX theater near you, the dragon scenes are awesome on the big screen!",1
1692,10.0,"I believe that Richard Harris was the better Dumbledore out of the two that we have seen. Richard Harris was so much warmer, and he literally had the famous Dumbledore ""twinkle in his eye"". It's such a shame that he passed away, because he was perfect for the part. ",1
1693,4.0,"Having read the book, I knew that the script for this movie would need to be pretty condensed for time. Still, I must say, I was disappointed by some of the scripting and direction decisions. Forgetting the omission of some key plot elements (i.e., house elves, Weasley's wizardly wheezes, expanded role of Sirius Black in Harry's life) that are integral to the next installment in the series, I was surprised by some of the additional plot elements added to tie up loose ends and explain missing elements (i.e., the quidditch world cup game, the introduction of Barty Crouch, Jr at the beginning of the movie??, the expansion of Neville's character to make up for the absence of others).",1
1694,10.0,"After viewing this movie in theaters, after all of the speculation and guessing, I must say the one and a half year wait was well worth it. From the beginning of this movie, from the thundering scores of the brilliant Patrick Doyle, to the rich, dark scenery, I knew this was a completely different Harry Potter film. ",1
1695,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) is a movie based on the successful novel written by J.K.Rowling, directed by Mike Newell. The movie is the fourth installment of the Harry Potter franchise known worldwide. Harry Potter, the protagonist continues his studies at Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, but this year, the school is participating in a wizarding competition called the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry is accidentally chosen to participate in the tournament, only to be revealed in the end that his enemy the Dark Lord Voldemort put his name in the Cup, just so he can be able to kill Harry.",0
1696,10.0,"First, I'd like to say how excellent this movie was; by far my favorite out of the series so far.",1
1697,10.0,"At last! Now I know where to tell smug people to go when they moan about adults reading the Harry Potter series: the cinema! After the beautifully made third movie, I didn't think this one would live up to expectation. The trailer looked like it was stuffed with too many large scale, numbing effects; I thought that the warm, intimate feeling of the third film would be lost. But how wrong I was. I never thought I'd say it, but this film was even better than Alfonso Cuaron's. ",1
1698,4.0,Goblet of Fire serves up a nice visual spectacle and avid followers of the Harry Potter books probably won't be disappointed. But folks like me who expect a well balanced cinematic meal and not just eye candy will probably leave the theater feeling a bit empty. The plot for this latest installment might have been adequate enough if this was a 60 minute TV episode but it's wafer thin at over two and a half hours. Wholesale chunks of the movie could have been cut out (such as the school dance business) and nobody would miss them except the fans. Fortunately for the film makers there are more than enough readers to guarantee a healthy box office return.,0
1699,10.0,"This Harry potter movie was the best out off all of them. The dream that harry has at the start of the movie about he-who-must-not-be-named was in his old house was an awesome. And where there at the Quidditch World Cup and the death eaters come. They destroy the whole camp but they left out were harry runs into the woods. Then the dark mark appears in the sky. When harry and his friends return to Hogwarts there is a tournament called the Triwizard Tournament and Harry's name gets pulled out off the goblet of fire. Ron and Harry's friendship is challenged as Ron thinks harry putted his name in the goblet without telling him. Once Ron sees harry faces his first task then Ron realizes that he could never have done that. They have to go to a ball called The Yule Ball and Harry asks Cho Chang but she has already going with Cedric Diggory Harry's main competition. And Ron accuses Hermione of being with the enemy. And on the last task they go through a maze and Viktor is bewitched and he tries to hurt harry but Cedric saves him and as the run together to the Triwizard Tournament cup, Cedric gets trapped by a vine and harry saves him like Cedric saved him. And as they grab the cup together they get sent to another place. A graveyard, were Voldemort returns and kills Cedric. Harry and Voldemort fight a dangerous and harry's mum, dad, Cedric and the housekeeper come out of Voldemont's wand and appear as ghost. the ghost hold Volemont off as harry grabs Cedric's body and the cup and he comes back to the crowd at the start of the maze. And it was mad,eye moody who had done all this but he wasn't mad, eye moody he was a death eater. He tried to kill harry but Dumbledore rescued him just in time.",1
1700,9.0,"I am a huge fan of the books, so I have high standards about the movie adaptations. I was disappointed with the first three because the director dwelled on special effects and dull moments that didn't advance the plot. The Goblet of Fire did neither.",0
1701,7.0,"I went to see goblet of Fire on a Sunday afternoon...subsequently there were many kids with parents, some as young as (I guess) 5 or 6....for anyone thats seen the film, you will understand why the line of children on my row persisted to cry many times throughout the film, and two others were removed with parents in tow due to them being scared!!!! Although the books are portrayed as children's books, the film versions are a different story.",1
1702,6.0,A was of money. I never have been so let down in a movie. Without the special effects this movie would have tanked. The story line changed so much from the book. Facts in which were crucial to the story line were changed. Some of the best information from the book was completely left out in the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet don't bother. I am almost sorry to say you should rent it but you know save money get it from a friend. Terrible if the books were anything like this movie no one would know what harry potter is. The best part of this movie is the special effects. For all you active harry potter fans lets pray that the next movie sticks to the facts.,0
1703,6.0,"As far as I can see, this film far outstrips the previous ones for sheer entertainment. Unlike the others it does not drag, or have numerous tedious lulls. It may not stick as closely to the book as some readers may have wished but it benefits, as well as suffers, as a consequence.",1
1704,10.0,"GoF was jam packed with entertainment. It had a lot of sweeping over landscapes, information was missing, and inaccurate (dragon) but it is the public's demand for fast pace action that demanded the dragon should be free to roam. I was disappointed that we did not get to see Sev showing Fudge the Dark Mark in the Hospital Wing and Sirius with the Weasley's but they had to be cut because of time limitations. We did get to see the mark on Crouch Jr though and it was very cool! I did like the scene with Sev pulling up his sleeves to tap Ron and Harry, even if it didn't happen in the books. The boys really improved with their acting! Emma was good too, but I didn't see the amount of improvement the boys had.",1
1705,10.0,"The movie was amazing! The actors really stepped up and delivered a performance worthy of the books. The movie compressed a lot of the action which made it so much more exhilarating to watch, it was very fast paced and entertaining. I think that Mike Newell did a very good job of presenting the Triwizard tournament, it was just as I pictured it! And the scene at the graveyard is taken completely out of the book, it was exactly as Rowling had described. Voldemort's return was especially gripping. His metamorphisis was bone-chilling, and altogether fantastic!!! Also, the Yule ball scene was adorable! To be quite frank, this movie was fantastic. For goodness sake, it made me cry. I was just glued to the screen. A fantastic job was done by everyone involved in this film. Unbelievable. Honestly, anyone even remotely interested in the Harry Potter series has to love this film. GOOD STUFF!!!",1
1706,,"I saw this movie last night at 11:59, and it blew me away. I thought the first two were pretty...meh.... the 3rd was well done, but this one..this one is just superb. mike Newell did an amazing job with this book, he understandably cut out quite a few chunks (including that ridiculous SPEW subplot, thank God!) the trios acting is improving, although it saddened me greatly that Alan rickman didn't get very much screen time. The special effects are stunning, brilliantly capturing the feel of the books. Mad Eye Moody is played to perfection by Bredan Gleeson, and Miranda Richardson does great as the sneaky Rita skeeter. The Teenage awkwardness was in there, but it didn't overwhelm the story. this movie is the greatest in the series, I'd recommend seeing it immediately!",1
1707,9.0,"If you are hoping that the Fourth Movie was going to be like the book, I am sorry to say that it isn't, but all together it is a wonderful film. All the actors did great in the film, they are really starting to show their talents. The special effects are right on point, with rich details, colors, and an amazing scenery. The new director did an outstanding job, it was very much worth the wait. I only wish they would have included a few more of the details from the book to add to the story and to set it up better for the Fifth movie. I do recommend this film to everyone, although there are a few scarier part that might not be suitable for the very young.",1
1708,4.0,"I am a faithful Harry Potter fan, and I have to admit, I was throughly disappointed with this movie. Vital parts of the movie were missing. ",0
1709,8.0,"HP and the Goblet of Fire is by far the best among the series. It was fascinating to watch, and screenplay was totally awesome. The two most captivating features of this film were the Yule Ball and the re-birth of Lord Voldemort, both perfectly shot, the outcome, simply amazing. No one can replace Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, his acting was so apt for his character. Though some chapters from the book were eliminated/ shortened, it didn't deviate from the main story. The effects, to create the duel scene were so cool! It has created a craze among all HP fanatics, and in comparison to the previous three films, it was the best! A great family- entertainment movie to watch and enjoy, no matter how many times you see it!",1
1710,6.0,"The Goblet of Fire was one of my favorite books in the series, but the movie does not capture the magic of the book. My feeling was that the film was rushed, and very brief. They failed to elaborate on the characters and the plot The first 150 pages in the book are compacted into 10 minutes of film, and the yule ball(which is not an essential to the plot)was drawn out and boring. Snape, McGonagall, Hagrid,Malfoy and Dumbledore all have small roles, and they give the best performances out of the whole cast. Moody was well portrayed, and so was Voldemort(although he looked like something from Men in Black). Some characters were completely cut out of the story, such as Dobby the house elf, and Ludo Bagman. Finally, I think that Harry, Ron, Fred, and George should all get haircuts because they look doofy with that hair. This movie was good, worth the 10 bucks, but did not live up to the book.",0
1711,9.0,"By far this movie is one of the best of the Saga... OK... Maybe Cauron's view of HP world was a little better (3rd movie), but, Mike Newell gives this movie a great touch... the British touch.",1
1712,9.0,"As most people I'm sure felt, I walked into the theatre wondering how are they going to put that entire book to the screen? I was impressed.",1
1713,9.0,"After waiting so long for this film I was pleasantly surprised by what i saw in the cinema this week. The film is amazing!!! The attention to detail is astounding and the acting talents of the cast have improved 100% on the last film. The mix of comedy, romance and drama make this film the best of the series and one which I'm sure we'll all want to see again and again. Although the beginning is rushed the rest of the story flows well. The 3 tasks are amazingly detailed and well done. Emotions are conveyed well and are really believable. One word of warning - view the books and movies as a separate thing otherwise you may be disappointed!",1
1714,1.0,"You know I really have to blame my ex girlfriend, co-worker, and friends for getting me into the whole Harry Potter thing. I'm really giving you guys a review from 2 perspectives. One: being if you *lighty* or never read the book and just see the movies when they come out. Two: Being the hard core Harry Potter fan who reads the books extensively and anticipates the movies to come out. I fortunately have had the pleasure of being on both sides of the barrel. Not being familiar with the series at all 5 yrs ago. I saw the first 2 movies and enjoyed them. Then went back and read all the books up to Half Blood Prince. I must say up until Goblet Of Fire...on the motion picture side the studios have done a great job staying true to the book. This one however strayed away from J.K. Rowlings classic so much it wasn't even enjoyable. Although I am aware of studio budgets and having to complete a film in under 3 hrs, key elements of the film were left out. Hagrids back story, Harry giving his winnings to Fred & George to set up the joke shop, No Doby leaving a scratch the surface plot on Barty Crouch story, and cameo's from Riter Skeeter...Sirius Black...and Draco Malfoy who played key characters in the book. The movies did have it's bright moments though. I enjoyed the humorous Professor Moody, Fred and George were equally comical, and the dark graveyard scene with the battle versus Lord Voltimort was the climax of the movie. However overall this movie was the worst rendition of the book. Which leads me to say: *If you read the book you'll hate it, If you just see the movies you'll like it*",1
1715,7.0,"Goblet of fire was better technically than the last Harry Potter movie,even Oscar-worthy is some respects, but important story segments were omitted for the sake of length. I think filmmakers should take 140 minutes if it takes that long to tell the story. I don't understand the reluctance of the Harry Potter character to tell his friends and teachers important details of his experiences that are vital to their safety. It doesn't ring true of an honest kid with nothing to hide. In fact, his reticence doesn't make sense in any context of the story, and stands out. My third comment is that the Hogwarts landscape keeps changing. Why? The choppiness, changing topography and unexplainable lack of dialog from the protagonist aside, it was a good film.",0
1716,10.0,"Of all the Harry Potter books, Goblet was by far my favorite. Having Enjoyed the previous 3 films I had extremely high expectations of this one. The actors had stellar performances while still maintaining a lighthearted mood at moments. The movie stays very loyal to the book and the Special effects were also some of the best I have yet seen in any film. This is clearly the best film of the 4 as my second favorite was Prisoner of Azkaban which i would give an 8, so this one is clearly an improvement on the last 3. There are still 3 more left so it is undoubted that once the 7th film is released Potter fans all over will be extremely content with the work of the actors and directors. I must say some of the movie was a little bit of for me, but I guess it is just the creative license of the crew and screenwriters.",1
1717,8.0,"The first tip-off that this may be the first adequate Harry Potter adaptation is that is rated PG-13. It says that there might be actual acknowledgment that there's scary stuff in here. Three murders, real evil, sexual innuendoall the grown-up stuff , or at least, grown-up to 14 stuff, is here.",0
1718,9.0,"It would have been better if Dumbledore was played by Max Von Sydow, and if Fleur was played by Heather Burns. They would have done much better in the roles, as they could easily play the part the way it was written in the book. I think Max Von Sydow has the perfect speech, and look to make Dumbledore come alive. Richard Harris had it down pat, but I don't think this guy can play it right. Other than that, it was great...the guy who played Mad Eye Moody was perfect....he really brought the role to life. Also the guy who played Krum did an excellent job. The special effects were very good too. ",1
1719,8.0,If I could vote this movie 8.5 out of 10 I would. Everyone knows the plot of the story so I won't go into it.,0
1720,6.0,"I thought there were too many gaps in this movie. While i think they did an admiral job of **trying** to condense it, there was too much that was awkward.",1

I mean, sure, I know that they can't have everything /exacty/ the same, but which was better, movie 3, or movie 4? Also, just out of curiosity, which director do you think has done the best job? Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, or Mike Newell? Since I am stupid and am not going to see them movie until tomorrow,(I was all happy that I was going to go and see it Sunday, and then I came on this site and heard how excellent it was so now I really, REALLY want to go watch it. ;_; I keep watching the trailer over and over... XD) I was just wondered what you thought of it. ^_^",1
1723,10.0,I thought it was the best Harry Potter movie yet. I was a little annoyed that they didn't put somethings from the book in but if they did it would be like 6 hours long!!! I thought the actors were incredible and the media saying that the actors will get too old for the rolls don't know nothing! Really enjoyed and will buy the DVD! Definitely in my top five movies of this year and my top ten of the 21st century! Love the Yule Ball and think Hermione is so hot! Think Ron the comedian is awesome too! The tasks and special effects are the best I have seen since LOTR and overall the film is excellently put together and cleverly directed! 5 Star!,1
1724,5.0,"Sigh. I had high hopes of seeing another interesting and entertaining Harry Potter movie, however, as my summary suggests, this movie did not provide the return on my movie $$ investment.",1
1725,1.0,"I have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, especially back in the day when USA used to show late night trash movies that were so bad that they had a comical entertaining value. Unfortunately for the Goblet of Fire, it has little value at all. Yes, the special effects were nice but were really not spectacular, rather sub par actually. The movie droned on for ever and ever and ever, without a climax, without good character development, and without anything to really keep your attention. I felt like I was watching a 2 and a half hour intro(like many of us may feel when listening the full version of Metallica songs). I know a lot of people will give me evil looks for this review but please, just because it is Harry Potter, does not mean it is so great. After about the first 30 to 45 min of the movie, I probably checked my watch every 20 minutes wondering when the movie would end. So I understand if you have to see the movie because you simply have to see Harry Potter but all I can say is that you will be wasting your money for a movie that just made to my top 10 worst movies of all time list and I don't say this lightly. If you must be entertained, just stick with the book.",0
1726,3.0,"I love Harry Potter. I have all the movies, read the books like a million times and know the plots inside and out. I understand that this fourth book is incredibly long, so portions of the movie had to be cut. Out of all the movies thus far, I have to say this is the worst of them I have seen. The movie was accurate in terms of the basic plot which is fine. One thing left out of the movie that has been consistent in all the books and previous movies is the magic and sparkle of the time at Hogwarts. There are times in the book where times are happy and Harry's world comes to life. There are times in the book that shows how great Hogwarts is compared to the life he has at home. none of which was shown in the movie. The movie is dark and lost a lot of the imaginative touch that was put in the book. THe movie is no longer appropriate for children, but has moved to the teenager and adult audiences.",1

1729,,"I read a lot of the comments on here and I, for one, cannot believe that some people hated this movie. Nevertheless, I respect your opinion. I just don't understand why. Sure, they cut out a lot. But honestly, the film still had substance and an excellent plot without the Dursleys or Molly Weasley or Winky. That was just excessive detail. Maybe it would have been nice to have it, but then you'd have been complaining that the movie dragged on and on. And I know some people think it would have been better as two movies, but if you think about it, would you have really wanted the movie to stop halfway through and then wait months to see the next half? Highly doubt it. I know I wouldn't have. People said, ""If you're a true Harry Potter fan, don't waste your money on this movie."" Well, I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and I feel that it was worth it because I'd definitely see this movie again. I even shed a few tears to be honest. I'm just not that picky about details in the adaptation because I know there's only so much that the cast and crew can do. I thought it was amazing. Here are some reasons why: - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson's acting have improved greatly. They were superb. - The effects and graphics were fantastic. - There was actually a plot. Those are just basic reasons. Personal reasons include: - I was seriously wowed. - My eyes were practically glued to the screen. - I liked that they still added some humour (like the bathtub scene with Harry and Moaning Myrtle; that was gold) - It made me cry. - I'd see it again for sure! This week, even! Improvements that could've been made (not many): - The beginning didn't have to be so incredibly rushed, but I guess it wasn't as exhilarating as the part we were all looking forward to--the TriWizard Tournament. - I will agree with you GoF movie-haters that Dumbledore wasn't himself. I agree that Richard Harris was much more suited (honestly, he was awesome *moment of silence*). But what can we do about it now? At least Harry, Ron, and Hermione all did excellent performances. EEEEK, I can't wait for the 5th movie. If this one was so amazing, imagine how awesome the next one will be!",1
1730,5.0,"Having read all the (excellent) books I was eagerly awaiting the Harry Potter film series. My disappointment was crushing when I saw the drivel that was released as Harry Potter 1 and 2. Suddenly book three was upon us with a new director and a much darker feel to it - it seemed as if the series would redeem itself from then onwards. Alas it wasn't to be as Goblet of Fire was one of the most disappointing films I saw all year. The intention of cutting most of J.K.Rowlings narrative is a good one (the book is over 600 pages long) but it is this narrative that makes the story so compelling to read. As a film the same story seems thin, either too slow or too rushed and until we see Lord Voldemort only the Tournament Tasks revive us from our slumber. The child actors are not going to cut it in the world of adult acting and it is up to the superb cast of British National Theatre actors (Maggie Smith etc) to give the film a degree of respectability.",0
1731,10.0,"I am not a frantic Potter-ophile but have read and greatly enjoyed all the books. I've enjoyed all the films as well but felt there was sometimes a lack of tension in the films...until The Goblet of Fire. I rate this so high because the film carries almost all of the important elements necessary to propel the story but even more shows what life is really like as a student of Hogwarts. The tension and elements are all fun but I particularly enjoyed the kids and how they've matured and seem to be working more in sync with each other. Also, most of the adults are given at least one good scene to show their stuff and I thought Maggie Smith was particularly hilarious. Why Brendan Gleeson didn't cop an Supporting Actor nom is beyond me. He ate up the screen. The script is tight and multiple viewings helps tie key elements together as well as what is forthcoming in future films. Those who feel every book chapter must transfer to the screen or the film is a failure should take note that including every little nuance makes for a long and tortuous experience. Now that the kids are ""aging"" I can't wait to see how they handle...hmmm....hmmm... Miss Umbridge.",1
1732,8.0,As a HP-movie lover who has not read any of the books I must say this was one of the most enjoyable ones. The tempo of the movie is simply amazing. Newell never lets u relax or doze off and keeps throwing story lines and events in your face. The amount of humor in this movie was by far the largest of the series so far though good proportioned.,1
1733,8.0,"Well well well, where do I begin? I firstly have read all the books and am a huge fan of them. I didn't enjoy the first two movies but enjoyed the third, even though I did get angry that they left out very vital parts (e.g. padfoot being sirius, prongs being his dad etc.). So to my surprise, I really enjoyed the forth film! I don't believe they left out too much vital information, even though I left the cinema thinking, ""that ending was very rushed....but actually did they need to explain much more?"" Voldermort was brilliant and I was very impressed (and terrified!) OK OK OK I agree, things could have been better at explanation. And some of the characters were a little bit...unrealistic e.g Dumbledore shaking harry etc. The main problem I have with the film is how they are gonna lead it on from here. Sirius is just not in the film enough, Snape is way too nice in the first 3 (he does improve in the 4th one) for it to lead to the 6th book, there needed to be some more explanation of the death eaters and in connection to Snape etc. Overall I enjoyed it and I would see it again. Partly because I was disappointment with the 3rd, I made myself enjoy the film for what it was, I just think the directors need to think long term... xxx",1
1734,5.0,"I enjoyed this film but felt that it wasn't nearly as good as the others, especially the third one (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). I know that it's difficult to cram as much was in the fourth book into a film of a regular length that average individuals can sit through, but I feel like the entire film was rushed and slapped together choppily. For those with short attention spans, this would be a great film to see - the individual scenes are so short that the viewer is constantly being thrown between them. I didn't like the directing as much as the previous films, and although the visuals were quite interesting, I feel like it didn't make up for the short scenes and choppy editing. It was good, but I felt like it could have been done better and I wouldn't have minded sitting through more for it to be more like the book it's based on.",1
1735,10.0,"Well, I saw it last night...going to the movie theater with very high expectations and lets face it, the movie didn't let me down. :) I have heard many complaints about it such as 'Come on, plot line! No one can understand it...' or 'Where did they leave this or that??', but, think people. If you had a book that size and hoped to squeeze all the information into merely a 2:40 hrs. movie you're nuts! The film has a lot of action, it keeps you at the edge of your seat, and I didn't hear ONE complaint about 'moving too slowly' or 'mom I'm bored!' inside the room.There are some things I thing should've been made better: -The quidditch world cup: Why the heck did they make it so damn..short?!?! The scene started out very exciting and fast-moving; amazing! Both teams flying into the field...then, nothing!I mean, cut to the tent and to the attacks? Not good. -The first task: Good idea about the chase and all but the scene lasted a little too much :P.....Most of it wasn't in the book! I loved the fact that it's not a kid's movie anymore!=D So...Run to see the movie!!",1
1736,9.0,"9... and a half! Harry Potter. Where do I start? First, we had the Philosopher's Stone, with Harry in his first year. Then came The Chamber of Secrets, where Harry grows up a little, and the chamber is opened. In the third movie, The Prisonar of Azkaban, where a little more is revealed, and it turns out that Harry has a godfather. But none of the three are anything compared to the Goblet of Fire. I laughed, I cried (twice!), I gasped, I screamed, I was on the edge of my seat. I loved it. I must say, that a lot IS left out, and I seemed to get confused throughout the movie, getting the fifth book mixed up with this one. I imagined parts of the movie to be completely different, which sort of ruined my own personal thoughts and fantasies, but then there was some things which were identical to my imaginations. The graphics were absolutely amazing (thanks to the Australian composers!) and very realistic. The main thing that bothered me about this movie, is that everything was so quick. Non stop, like BAM next scene, BAM next scene, BAM, BAM, not one moment of boredom. It was confusing, but I guess they had to do it that way, otherwise either a lot would be left out, or the movie would go for 5 hours. All those who haven't seen it yet, I suggest you do... I'm going to see it again tomorrow!",1
1737,4.0,"I am an avid reader of the Harry Potter series, and I found this movie EXTREMELY disappointing. In my opinion, it was nothing like the book. Like the others, they always put stupid stuff in that wasn't in the book and take out important or interesting things that are. I was severely disappointed when Mr. Columbus didn't direct after the first two since his were MUCH closer to the book than this one and the third one. My advice is to rent it if you haven't seen it yet and buy it when it comes out if A) you are a fan of either the books or the movies or B) like to watch good actors playing good characters being portrayed as idiots. I feel terribly for Ms. Rowling having to see her books massacred like that.",0
1738,8.0,"I've seen GoF about 4 times now. If there is one word to describe this movie, it would be DISAPPOINTING. Don't get me wrong, judged on its own merits, this GoF is a good, though not memorable, movie. However, to judge this movie means to take it in its proper context as a Harry Potter film in the Harry Potter series.",0
1739,6.0,"I just came home from watching this movie, and I have to say I'm disappointed. After seeing the ""The Prizoner of Azkaban"", I was really hopeful about the direction in which the movies were going. Sadly, it's going the wrong way again.",0
1740,10.0,"The best one I've seen yet. A quality film. Loved every minute of this film and can not stop watching it over and over again. It was just magical!! Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson all did the film proud and each one deserves credit for how big the films have become especially Rupert as he is not usually credited as a main character compared to Emma and Dan when he should be because I believe that without all three in the films they would not be able to produce the right impact. I am glad to see that they have all signed up for the next film and only hope they sign for them all as they are all great actors. I wish them all the best of luck and hope that one day I may be able to meet them to congratulate them in person for already gaining an illustrious career",1
1741,10.0,"Overall, this movie was really a giant leap forward. The previous three had mainly been fillers on what happens in the world of magic and the introduction to key characters, i.e. Sirius Black, Ron and his family, the school's staff and grounds. Also, the acting hadn't been up to par and there were all sorts of problems with the 'maturing' of the actors. Because the actors have sort of stabilised, the movie contains some brilliant acting and contains very real scenarios that are prevalent in many people's lives, such as girls and death. The leap from good magic to the darker side of magic in this movie is awesome for the majority of Harry Potter fans, who understand that these books are not just for children but for adults as well.10/10",1
1742,10.0,This is the article I wrote for my university's newspaper after seeing the film.,0
1743,10.0,Months before the movie came out I knew that molly weasly was not going to be featured in this film and was disappointed. So much was cut from the book. It would be extremely confusing to someone who has not read the book. So if you have not read the book I suggest reading the book before watching the movie. Long book yes...but if you have time on ur hands and are a fast reader like myself you should be done with it in about a week. It took me 3 days :P. I was also upset that they cut out the scene where Sirius Black and Harry met up in dumbledores office after the maze. I was really looking forward to that scene. The only scene Sirius had was when he appeared in the fireplace. They really sped up though the whole movie and didn't explain much through it. Perhaps Order of the Phoenix will be better *crosses fingers*. Read The Book if you have not already done so before seeing the movie.,0
1744,10.0,"I just saw the latest movie and I love it. If you haven't seen the latest movie, go see it. If you hate the Harry Potter series, then don't go see it. But if you love to watch the movie(s), go see it. But if you are just curious the Harry Potter character, watch the first three movies before you go see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Because if you don't, then you don't know what's really going on. This movie is the fourth movie in the installment of Harry Potter series. You can watch the movie, but you probably would get confused about the story plot once you get further into the movie. But good work on the part of the director, producer and the actors in the movie, portraying the characters of the book series. You also feel the actors portraying the character's feelings really good and you just feel that there is a lot of good and a lot of bad in the movie. You just don't know at times whether or not it's good or bad feelings.",1

1746,7.0,"In the whole I thought ""Goblet if Fire"" was better than ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Prisoner of Azkhaban"". However, I was very disappointed by the scene in the cemetery. The Deatheaters,especially Luscious Malfoy and Wormtail didn't seem to be at all afraid of Voldemort. It seemed they were just a bit apprehensive. Wormtail wasn't even in pain when he cut off his own arm. Voldemort himself did not project that sense of power and dread that readers of JK Rowling have come to expect from He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. There wasn't enough suspense. I thought that instead of putting the effort into the dragon scenes they should've enhanced the cemetery scene. The book is so much better!!!!!",0
1747,5.0,"The last 50 minutes is thoroughly done. First half of the movie is consisted of many scenes that don't really connect to each other, more like watching random tiktok videos of the same creator..<br /><br />This is the weakest movie of all HP series.

1749,9.0,"I have watched the Goblet of Fire last night and I found it good, but rushed, though. Some, in my opinion, important moments from the book were barely mentioned or not mentioned at all (Quidditch World Cup, e.g.), and events are happening too fast, so those people who didn't read the book can barely keep up with the story. Also, the scene when Cedric dies is rushed too (Wormtail says ""Avada Kedavra"", green light flies and Cedric falls dead) - the whole scene lasts for a couple of seconds, and that is, together with the scene of Voldemort's rebirth (which is also too short), key scene of the fourth part of the saga. I think that the movie would certainly be a lot better if it lasted a half an hour more, but what to do - what is done is done. That aside, that new type of shooting (with camera always in motion and short cuts) and special effects, make this movie an excellent adventure with no boring part, which makes this movie (in my opinion) the best in this serial so far, and this made me give a solid 9 to the ""Goblet of fire"".",1
1750,10.0,"I've seen all 4 Harry Potter movies and read all 6 Harry Potter books. By far, this is my favorite of the Harry Potter movies so far. Yes, some things from the book were cut from the screenplay, but in my opinion, nothing essential was left out. The ""additions"" in the movie that weren't in the book helped to clarify the plot and fill in what was ""cut"" without ruining the flavor of the story. I don't think this was accomplished as well in ""Prizoner of Askaban.""",0
1751,8.0,"The movie was pretty good overall, but the ending had me feeling depressed. Out of all the movies I've seen, the ending when Amos Diggory had his little soap opera-esquire moment on Cedric's body was the most depressing thing I've ever seen. I'm not going to forget this. It almost made me cry. And they didn't even need it. Sure, the loss was something heavy on Amos Diggory's mind, but this is supposed to be an action movie. And the violins and the ""NOOOOOOOOO!!! That's my boy! My SON!!!! BOOOO-HOOOOO!!!"" was sadder than the Field of Dreams ending. I would've minded it if this was a non-fantasy movie since that's what can really happen in real life, but really people: Was the boohoo Amos Diggory crying 2 minutes of depression and emotional scarring really worth putting in the movie? I don't think so. I bet Cedric will end up coming back to life in the seventh movie and kicking some Voldemort butt alongside Mr. and Mrs. Potter, Dumbledore, Sirius, Frank Bryce, and whoever else dies that was on the good side. And imagine Neville Longbottom being the Heir of Slytherin!",1
1752,8.0,"I went to see the movie, thinking it would be the best I ever saw. As the movie started, I was stunned. My first disappointment came when they cut out the Quidditch World Cup (except the campgrounds and walking to their seat). I really wanted to see the veela, and some Quidditch, because for the Triwizard Tournament, Quidditch was out of the movie. Then came the first challenge. They only showed Harry fighting the dragon, and they didn't even show the Chinese Fireball. The Yule Ball and the events leading up to it were hilarious, and I thought Hagrid ""putting his moves"" on Madme Maxime was particularly funny. The second task didn't disappoint, but it left me wanting more. There were two things I noticed about the third task. First, it was supposed to be in the Quidditch Field. And the second was that they left all of the creatures out, I particularly wanted to see the Sphinx. Voldemort looked good, but the whole thing with him was a little short. In the end, it was good, but not enough.",0
1753,10.0,Everyone was perfect for the parts they played and so many times it's exactly like how I imagined it in the book! It is also way more action and the digital effects are fantastic! Ralph Finnes is perfect for the Role of Voldemort. The movie is also much more grown up than the other 3 Movies. This is my favorite Harry Potter movie Yet. Some fans may be disappointed for how fast it rushes through the story-line but the redeeming qualities are the amount of work they put in to the entire film. This film also is more comical and has more joke than the other movies. Prepare to be sitting for a long time because of the length of the movie. Other than that I highly recommend going to see this movie!,1
1754,10.0,"I have been an avid reader of Harry Potter for years and have been fortunate enough to grow up with it, which is why I am such a huge fan. So far I have loved all the books as well as all the movies and I can confidently say that I loved this movie just as much. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie may well have had parts taken out, but I think this was done cleverly, and I'd much rather see this movie as it is than two separate ones with a lot of dragging, unnecessary detail. I do feel that several characters should have been put in though, such as Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf. Nevertheless, I still thought the movie was absolutely fantastic. I thought the script was great - whilst in some cases scenes tended to jump, it was still wonderful as I never felt bored and was always grasped by the story - extremely important in any movie. In addition, I thought the actors all did justice to their roles; especially Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. All in all a majestic piece of work - all the money invested was worthwhile and it will be loved by millions around the world. Harry Potter overall is totally amazing; all the books have been, as have the movies, and I am extremely lucky as a fourteen - nearly fifteen - year old to have truly grown up with a dose of magic.",1
1755,1.0,"nothing to spoil, i joined just to tell you to save your money and go see ANYTHING else. i am sad i spent the money. wow and i thought #3 was bad, this makes it look Oscar worthy. the movie was poorly edited and characters were removed. if you are going to change things in the interest of time, at least cut the whole thing or character! and if things don't make it shorter, why change them? also way overboard on the CG effects, maybe 2 movies would have been a good idea. the girls were not very pretty. I don't know how they can possibly continue after removing essential plot elements, like the plot. the film sor of jumped from one scene to the next with little transition and dumbledore can suck it. he has no grasp on the sprightly wise kindly character in the book. Hermione is way to pretty and confidant, in the books she is awkward and gangly and a know it all, but by the second movie she was all cute little popular girl looking. The ghosts seem to have disappeared from the plot all together as well as house elves and the maurauders map, which was sort of ditched in film 3. also they could use a haircut, all of them. and since when do they wear muggle clothes?",0

There were good parts in it, but it felt like you were watching a cut and paste movie--it skipped around so much that by the end of the movie, you let with that feeling of, ""was that it? what happened?"" And the answers are, ""Yes"" and ""Nothing really did happen"" At least in the other movies, they can stand alone, they don't reference another movie to follow--that is all this movie is, a fluffer to the next one. Hopefully, when they release it out onto DVD, they will do something a special edition (similar to what they did with Lord of the Rings)to fill in some of the glaringly large gaps that are present.",1

1758,10.0,"I must premise this review by noting that I have not seen any of the previous Harry Potter movies and had never had the desire to do so. Still after seeing the trailers and hearing all of the tremendous feedback, I went to see Goblet of Fire with no idea of the storyline, no idea who any of the characters were and left the theater HOOKED! I was glued to my seat throughout the film's entirety and was thoroughly engrossed with each and every scene. The acting was superb, the young cast going head to head with such veterans as Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, and so many more. Not only visually appealing, the storyline and character development were masterful. I have to admit, I have caught Harry fever, albeit four films late!!!",0
1759,8.0,"A group of friends and i went to see the new Harry Potter dressed up - as we're all good fans. We were amazed but slightly disappointed. They missed out like half the book but the effects were amazing. My friends and i were reviewing it all the way through - we even got a few ""SHH""'s & ""Be Quiet""'s . We weren't even talking that loud! The cause of discussion was how Dan can't act & disagreement with the script. Anyway, on the bright side, we enjoyed watching Dan scrawling in pain - we were saying that that's about the best acting you get from him. Overall though, it's a good film and part of the sequel so you need to watch it. Look out for the amazing effects, no classes and remember kids, Always go to the toilet before a film!",1
1760,8.0,"I watched the 12 a.m. showing of this movie as well. Unlike many other fans, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have read all Harry Potter books more than once, so am very familiar with the series. Yes, I do feel, like others, that the beginning of the movie moved pretty quickly in comparison to the novel. However, what can we really expect? I felt the director did a good job in displaying integral parts. The emphasis of the movie was placed on the most important themes: the maturing of the characters, and the full emergence of Voldermort. The director did an excellent job in capturing the awkward feelings of teenagers in that age, and the end seen was played out exactly how I imagined it. He achieved the task of leaving that eerie feeling looming for the audience to wonder ""what will happen next"". As Hermione says, ""Everything is going to change now, isn't it"". (This not being a spoiler as the line is in the trailer) Only thing: I believe too much emphasis was directed to a certain character that should not have been suspected at all in the movie. Yes, there were many enjoyable details left out that us readers may have liked to see play out. Fortunately, Rowling has a talent of writing incredibly intricate books. There is no way they would have been able to create a movie that would do the novel justice in 2 1/2 hours time. I believe the director made good choices in the cutting of the novel. If you enjoy the movies and have not read the books...I can definitely say: YOU'RE MISSING OUT! However, for the audience members who are simply looking for good magical fun..they will definitely get that from watching any of the Harry Potter movies. The basic themes are displayed..and the movies are cohesive enough for non-readers to understand the main plot. The graphics are amazing, the cinematography incredible, and the whole movie completely entertaining and enjoyable from the beginning to the end. I definitely recommend this movie...but it may not be for the small ones due to some dark themes. Enjoy!",1

Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore. The last time I read the books Dumbledore was cool, calm and collected not some overexcited, jumpy loud dude. Also, the movie does good justice until the third task...after that it sort of like, director realized movie getting bigger than 2.5 hrs and just rushed thru it. (I don't want to listen to the reason that 3hrs is unbearable compared to 2.5) He didn't even consider important to show the death of Barty Crouch Jr. upon which entire 5th book is dependent on.

""Incomplete"", of course it was not a bad movie, however it was way to distant from the level the book achieves, the effects were great, the dragons were amazing, but... there were lots of scenes... crucial scenes missing, e.g. M. Maxim is never accused of murdering Crouch, there are no animals nor dementors (ok...Boggart) and there was NO Sphinx, Dumbledore never tells harry about how were there the Longbottoms tortured with Cruciatus, nor that they're still alive, another important part missing is that Harry never gives Fred & George the money for them to open their store, some conversations with Sirius are missing and all the tension of knowing who is Hermione's partner is missing too.

There attitudes were great and changed and i found out things i never knew about a few of the characters. J.K. Rowling is a genius and very inspiring. Who ever doesn't want to get into the Harry Potter wizard world has no real imagination or dreams. You'd have to be crazy to not love this or at least like Harry Potter.

I love every single detail and rabbit trail Jo has in the book, but when you think about the fact that every page in a book translates into one minute on the screen, i'm okay with having a 165 minute movie instead of an almost 800 minute movie. As much fun as it would be to see it all, we all waited on pins and needles for this movie, and to put every single thing in would have taken much longer. I was highly irritated with the way Dumbedore was abrasive and very short with Harry. They could have handled casting a bit better, I don't think Clemmence Posey was the best Fleur. She definitely looked the part, but there was no explanation about the veela. Overall I think the movie was amazing. Definitely should be watched by HP fans and non-fans alike.",1

I do NOT understand how anyone could understand this movie if they hadn't read the book because it leaves so many details out (to be such a long movie) and how anyone could enjoy it if they'd read the book because so much WAS left out. I never heard where it explained about B. Crouch being killed in the woods (for the people who haven't read the books) or how B. Crouch, JR. got out of Azkaban. Not starting at Privet Dr. seemed like a serious let down, as was missing a depiction of ton-tongue toffees, not meeting Bill Weasley or the excellent way the Intl. Quidditch Cup was depicted in the books,along with Winky, and the maze was just boring compared to the book, and well I could go on and on. The direction seemed lacking to me along with the script to go with the emotions, but I am just a viewer. Does anyone else think maybe too much was left on the editing room floor or possibly the director should've been? Very little that made the book great seemed represented here - I guess I just needed a 6 hr. movie with substance instead of a 3 hr. movie with just action without explanation. By the way, could anyone enlighten me as to how come the directors keep changing (albeit I'm thankful for the next change)?",0

It wasn't scary at all. The only thing that would be scary for children would be the creatures, and maybe Madame Maxime. Fleur was definitely a letdown because in the book they portray her as a beautiful, graceful girl and I could have played the part better than her. She looked just like an average girl.

First, you cannot skip (or fast forward) through 1/5 of the book and have a stable storylineThe plot development was left to the imagination. The omission of key story line was appalling. The adlib of the story was ridiculous. I cannot imagine that anyone who has read the book can enjoy this film for much more than the title screen Just a hintIf you have not read the book, don't expect the movie to make much sense. Furthermore, if you plan to watch any future HP films, read the book...A lot of important development was omitted.",0

In short, it certainly was. In this film, the characters progress from somewhat shallow early teens in the first movies, to young adults faced with life changing decisions. This movie, as it is much more serious in subject matter than the first few, is darker and in my opinion suspends disbelief very well. The visual effects, especially in the tri-wizard tourney, are superb. I would highly recommend this film to Potter fans, and just plain movie buffs alike.",1

It is, in my opinion, the worst of the series while the book is the most complex and interesting if you consider only the four first books(since on the whole, the books in this series have the tendency of not only becoming gloomier, but also better and better, both as far as plot is concerned, but also characters, situations, everything.)The result however is dreadful, like some apprentice just chopped off the juiciest moments and packed the left ones pell-mell. I am sorry to see that the author allowed this to happen to her book. Also, I have to notice that not one of the directors and writers has introduced Peeves as a character, and this discrimination is revolting in as much as it has deprived us of many savoury moments. If directors/writers have reduced this wonderful book to such a lamely result, I do not even want to think what they'll make of books V and VI who are even more complex. For the moment I feel that maybe giving up Chris Columbus was the worst decision ever.",0
1779,6.0,"I could not wait to see this movie. Not only am I a big fan of the books but I am also a big lover of film (which I earned a degree in). Goblet of Fire was by far one of my favorite books of the saga, so I was indeed looking forward to seeing how and if a new director could capture the feel and setting of this book. ",0
1780,10.0,"It's fast going, exciting,and fun! The movie won't ever be as great as the books, but it gets close to it and isn't disappointing. Got to the main things and gives you a fun ride. The dark scenes were the best! The darker the better for Harry Potter --well it will be exciting part of it. It's really whoa! Then again isn't Harry Potter like that? The character's have grown and not just physically. The nasty side to friendship between Ron and Harry was great to see and as always Hermione trying to smooth things out. Harry is once again a victim to someone who wouldn't kill him but definitely bother him. Rita really goes out after Harry and how she tries to make it look like Harry's with Hermione is cute. Hermione's crying was actually great! I thought that was her best scene when she's crying on the steps at the Yule Ball. It's wonderful seeing the different schools and how they are represented. The music, the action, and the characters were all great!",1
1781,4.0,"First off let me say I'm probably reviewing this from a rather one sided point of view having read the books. The movie all together isn't bad for children but it has a severe lack of plot. It seems the director and producers decided to shove as much time and money as possible into visual effects and completely leave out the subplots and side stories that really help to build the characters. I was severely disappointed when I heard they were originally going to make this book into two movies. So many characters and important events have been left out. Most importantly, there is no set up for the rift between hogwart's and the ministry of magic, which nearly the entire point of the next in the series. At first I was worried as to how they will be fixing this in the next film but I suppose they wont have to if the goal is to rely on special effect and not good acting or writing. Hats off to Columbus, I hope he is headed back to the series. The only reason I don't give this a lower reason is because it IS intended for children, but as Harry grows, so do his readers, and the film industry needs to understand that by the end of this series they will need to tend to a much more mature audience. 4 out of 10",0
1782,9.0,"I thought the special effects and action sequences in this were rather well-done, plus Grint finally had lines that weren't summed up as 'comic relief.' The beginning, though, felt 'odd' to say the least - the transitions felt a bit off, though this feeling had abated by the time everyone'd made it to Hogwarts.",1
1783,6.0,"I enjoyed the movie, but think it was rather rushed. The base cast did their usual good job portraying their respective characters. The catch here is that maybe the director tried to put too much into a film this length. The original idea to release the movie in 2 parts (Ala. Kill Bill) might have been better. The film as released left a lot of holes in the story as written. While I agree some of the sub plots were not missed a few others were needed to answer questions for some first or second time Potter movie viewers. All in all it was a good movie, but shrinking later stories to fit time should be watched very closely.",1
1784,10.0,"I thought this was a great movie. I may be biased, however, since Mike Newell is one of my favorite directors. If you had never known, read, saw, or heard anything about Harry Potter before in your life and went to see this movie, you would think it was just a great movie with humor, suspense, action, some romance, and tested friendships. I mean, if you figured out all that Voldemort stuff, ya' know?",1
1785,10.0,"I love harry potter. I have read every book to date, and was extremely excited to see my favorite book on the big screen. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was amazingly well done. After what I considered a bad choice of direction in the third movie, HP4 bounced back with amazing graphics, sound, acting talent. Though some scenes moved faster than they probably should have, this movie stuck to the books, which as a Harry Potter buff, was exciting to me. The shot in every scene were extremely well done and I won't lie; I nearly cried in the end when Wormtail killed Cedric. The movie somehow managed to keep me on the edge of my seat even though I read the book and knew who lived and who died. The movie was absolutely amazing, and I never want this series to end.",1
1786,7.0,"I thought the movie was good, but not as an adaption of the book. Too much was left out. I understand the frustration of turning an 800 page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie, but felt that much of the storyline that flows into the next book/movie was omitted. The biggest issue for me was the change in Dumbledore's character. I think Michael Gambon is a great actor and I do like him as Dumbledore (although I miss Richard Harris). I understand that Mr. Gambon is acted the part as written, but felt the character is far removed from the one in the books. If you haven't read the books, you will like the movie; if you have read the books, try not to think about them and enjoy it for what it is: an action movie sort of based on a book.",0
1787,6.0,Initially I was not going to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire because of my growing disillusionment with the franchise and the belief that it was undeserving of the massive economic success it enjoyed.,1
1788,7.0,"In the beginning they decided to put very little time into the Quidich World Cup. It was one of the biggest events in the other movies and was heartily missed. The three tasks were filmed greatly, however with another half hour of film, they could have put more time into the ending. In the book, Sirus is introduced to Snape as still being alive, however in the movie, they don't give us much of any Sirus time. I was well pleased with the casting and acting of the actor for Lord Voldermort. Overall, I think that a much better job could have been done if there had been one more hour to tell the story. They did 3 1/2 hours in Lord of the Rings, why not with this? For a final note I would like to comment on the last minute of the credits. I found it hilarious that they decided to tell us ""No dragons were harmed during the making of this film."" That made my day. I was also quite glad to see that they took the time at the very end to stick their casting director Mary Selway. May she rest in peace.",1
1789,8.0,"I saw the movie today and I was a little disappointed. They left out so many good parts and left out some characters in the story. I also think they should have exceeded the scenes when Cedric dies. I'm usually always crying when somebody dies, and I thought for sure I would be bawling when Cedric dies, but I didn't. He died within a second, and that was basically the end of that. It was a very good movie and all, love the special effects, but I think it could have been better. I also think they should have more scenes with Malfoy in it. In the past three movies he's shown up a lot, but in this one he only had around three scenes! And what happened to Sirius and Buckbeak? They should have taken the scene with Sirius in the fire out because it doesn't really fit in there. I know it's hard to fit everything in a movie, but they should have arranged it better. Now on the positive side, the dragon scene and the underwater scene and the maze scene was awesome. The maze part was a little freaky, had made me jump a few times. I love how they also did the dragon part. I also think it was hilarious when Madame Maxine and Hagrid were dancing at the Yule Ball, very funny. Over all, I would give it 8 out of 10 stars.",1
1790,10.0,Well as serious as this movie was supposed to be it was awesomely funny. ,0
1791,5.0,"A good-ish film. It's fair to give it 5/10. Daniel Radcliffe bored me, Hermione was hardly in and Ron was surprisingly cute. The guy who caught my eye was Matthew Lewis-Neville Longbottom. He's certainly grew up- he's tall, thinner and attracting the girls. Same for Rupert. The pasty skin boy is tall and gorgeous with his longer hair. Newcomer Katie Leung excelled. The girl who played Fleur was good at her Frech accent-or is she actually French? I don't know! Think twice about taking young children- there is mild threat,horror and swearing. In one scene Ron turns around and goes ""P**s off!"" to Harry. Also why does Ron always say ""Bloody hell!""? Anyway, it is a good film so go and catch it!",1
1792,10.0,"i so love this film it is the best film i have ever seen i can never get bored of this film ever i so can't wait for the next one to come out. i love everything that has happened in this film. all the actors and actresses were great and they done a terrific job at everything. All the other harry potter films they were in were very good as well but i really loved this one it was so exciting and entertaining. I could watch it over and over again and never get bored. My favourite parts are the first task with the dragons and the part where harry is in the bath in the prefects bathroom. my favourite characters in this film were Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, tom Felton, clemence poesy and Katie leung they were excellent. i thought it was funny as well as scary. i really didn't like it when Cedric died i really wanted to cry. what i liked about the first task is that it is very exciting and you think oh what's gonna happen next and i really didn't want harry to get hurt. what i liked about the second task is that it seems really relaxed at first but then there are all these mer-people and harry wants to free Hermione and Ron but Hermione is for Victor to save. what i liked about the third task the maze is that it is excellent the way they have done all the special effects and it's just great to be able to watch a film with that kind of thing in it. i thought it was horrible the way voldemort put harry behind an axe which was voldemorts fathers grave and the going to touch his scar. it must have been really painful. and i really wanted to cry when he and Cedric got back to hogwarts but Cedric was already dead and then there is harry crying and it was just horrible i don't like seeing people upset even if it is a film and there is Amos diggory crying and yelling ""my boy that's my boy!"" i really felt sorry for him and harry. but then it turned out alright in the end and i felt abit better. i thought it was funny when harry and Ron were at the yule ball and they had to go with the patil twins that was quite funny actually. and then there's Ron jealous because Hermione had gone with Victor krum instead of with him. because like at the beginning of the film, Ron was mad about Victor but then he hates him for taking Hermione. its so totally obvious that he likes her. and harry really wanted to go with cho Chang but she went with Cedric and it was quite funny. i also thought is was funny when they are having a test or something in the great hall and they are talking and snape hits them with a book and everything. the film was funny, horrible, exciting, terrifying all in one i would definitely consider buying this on DVD.",1
1793,,"I found this film hilarious and heartfelt, Loyal enough to the book, yet changed a bit, but still not changing a whole chunk of the plot(which I've seen in many other films). SPOILER ALERT!*if u have not yet seen the film, u may not want to read!*",1
1794,9.0,"This film was amazing! I went to see it the first night it came out, as I'd been waiting to see it for a long, long time. The special effects were incredible definitely the best so far and all completely believable. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson (Harry and Hermonie) have improved immensely from the last film and Rupert Grint (Ron) was still as convincing as ever. The tournaments were excellently done apart from I would say the third was not long enough and missed a lot out from the book, but it had to be because of small space they had to fit it in. It was definitely the scariest and most moving film so far. However the reason I only gave this a 9 rather than full marks is because it was lacking in all the traditional Harry Potter things that we all love to see, for example there was no sorting hat, no trip to hogsmeade and hardly any actual classes nor any Dursley's or Diagon Alley visits. Another downside was the music in all the other films John Williams (perhaps the greatest film composer of all time) has composed the music yet they got someone different who I feel was pretty awful, on sad bits there was happy music which ruined it, and hardly any music in it at all, and what music there was, was rubbish which was a real shame. Although all of this the screenplay was incredible and the trio were much more believable as teenagers than ever before and some scenes were outstanding like the bath one with Moaning Murtle. I definitely think that you should go to see this film if you have not already and try and see past the bits they just had to miss, and enjoy all the action and funny parts.",1
1795,1.0,"although the film does try to stick to the book (apparently) i cant help but feel the films are aiming more and more towards the really young kids. Harry Potter is enjoyed by everyone, and i think its a shame that the older teenagers cant enjoy the film. The plot of the film also trails off at a tangent, and although keeping the triwizard tournament the focus, they mess around with the barty crouch stuff and moody stuff. all in all, and extra 20 minutes wouldn't have hurt the director to add those extra bits in. QUite disappointing, only watch if you have read the book, as you may not understand everything. The only decent bit was the end biot with voldermort, it woz pretty much accurate, and voldemort looked like i imagined him, that is the only reason the films gets a one in my opinion.",0
1796,10.0,"Maybe I am just a fan.. but I was on the edge of my seat... The acting was excellent; the adaptation held it's own; the emotion was high and appropriate to the plot. Sure there were holes I think for those who are not fans of reading the books... but I loved it! Very scary at parts.. wonderful changes in the characters.. like Dumbledore for the first time losing control.. well played.. very well played.. what a performance. The only thing that I can say that would be remotely negative is that Bartimus Crouch Sr. comes off like a child molester.. I read the books of course to I knew the implication was not that in anyway.. but for someone unfamiliar, they might wonder at his motives and why Moody says.. Trying to lure him to an apprenticeship.. It funny to me as a reader.. but unclear to someone who is not.. BUT WOW,.. fantastic.. different... wonderful.",1
1797,8.0,"first, i want to make it clear that the movie didn't fulfill my expectations i have after reading the book. ",0
1798,10.0,"Harry potter and the goblet of fire is undoubtedly the best movie of the series by far. Its cinematic presentation represents the darkness of the book, without removing the films ""comedic"" feel. The reason why this movie is claimed to be ""incredible"" is because it simply is. It distinguishes itself from the rest of the movies through its script, its mood, and the ending which is quite depressing and tragic. Every movie improves its flaws and gets better and better as the series progresses. Its good to see that this movie did not only live up to its hype, but exceeded my expectations tremendously. Overall the movie was excellent, flawless, and will set the line for the other Harry Potter films to come.",1
1799,9.0,"My thoughts on GoF I just went to see GoF yesterday and can I just say that this may be the best HP movie yet, tying (sp?) with PoA.",1
1800,10.0,"I had extremely high expectations for this movie and I was not disappointed. After what seemed like an eternity, it was finally here. The performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were excellent! This is by far the most wicked Harry Potter movie. The director added little tidbits to make the conversations more modern which were much easier to relate to and picture in a usual teen's life. I hope the actors do all the movies, I simply can't rave about it enough. One difference I noticed was that I preferred Cedric's character in the movie much more than in the book. This is not my favourite HP book but definitely my favourite movie. Just fantastic! Books made into movies are usually very disappointing for me but Mike Newell did it right this time! A movie finally does its book justice! Congratulations and looking forward to seeing the series evolve and continue in its greatness!",0
1801,,"I actually haven't seen this film (went two times both sold out), but I think its funny just how many people gave this film a 1. Obviously 99% of the 400+ people that gave a 1 were dire-hard book fans upset that they didn't have a scene they thought was ""crucial to the film"".",1
1802,10.0,"I went into Goblet of Fire not sure what to expect, as I was a little disappointed by the third movie. However, I was blown away. If you have read J.K. Rowling's books, you already know that the story is amazing. This movie really did the book justice. Although certain story lines were eliminated or condensed for time reasons, the most important issues where still touched on and the main themes from the book were very present. The entire cast has matured as actors, just as the characters and storyline is maturing. On top of all of that, the movie was visually stunning. They really created a fantasy world that you want to be part of in this movie. Go see it! You will not be disappointed. It is the best of the Potter movies yet. Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!",1
1803,6.0,Saw the movie last night (18 hrs ago) and was pleasantly surprised by the relative maturity of the movie. My grouse against the earlier movies were they were solely focused on the young adult audience while this one seems to handle the book much better.,1
1804,7.0,"If common practice is to be observed, I should really mention Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia for comparison when starting this review. However, I will refrain. Director Mike Newell has said that he viewed the fourth outing for Harry Potter as a suspense thriller and the starting scene certainly falls into this category. I got a genuine creepy feeling as Frank Bryce climbed the stairs of the house (and I knew what was coming!) The whole film however doesn't manage to maintain this suspense. My main criticism with the film versions of the Harry Potter books is that they are a series of (very enjoyable) set pieces. Snapshots of the books strung together with a bit of plot. I can't complain too much though. Goblet of Fire is an exciting and enjoyable two and a half hours and does move the series on. The acting from the main characters is better than before, although I'm still not that convinced by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. The next two books in the series deal with more uncomfortable situations and issues which could make for a really great viewing experience. It will also be interesting to see how the next film compares now that Steve Kloves is not writing it.",1
1805,4.0,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I guess more so of the books rather than the movies. I must say this movie was not the best of the four movies to date. It seemed as if they took the whole school year and jumbled it into one day. There was no noticeable change of season. I tried to forget details from the book itself in order to enjoy the film more, but I could not do it.",1
1806,7.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire This past weekend , I saw the movie Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire the third time . As part of the popular Harry Potter book and movie series, it was definitely one to remember. This movie is mainly about a larger-scale competition between wizards that takes place at Hogwarts over the course of the school year . Harry has been entered into the contest , which is known as the triwizard tournament, and many twists and turns make for quite the adventurous challenges , and mysterious behavior that they are forced to decode . New characters were introduced in this film ,which was an enjoyable aspect and added a new element of intrigue that the previous Harry Potter films did not possess . Although my favorite was still the same Harry Potter ( Daniel ) because of his outstanding performance . Furthermore , this installment of the series seemed to follow its literary counterpart the most closely and accurately . Also, a great aspect of the film was the special effects,particularly with regard to all of the scenes featuring the dragons. This movie was also different from the rest because it had more story concerning the characters' love lives. In one particular scene , there was a dance that all of the tournament contestants were to attend. The characters went to the ball , and it was so much fun to watch . First of all , the scenery of the ball was exquisite, and it was so cool to actually feel like you were there ! This was definitely one of the highlights of the movie. On the contrary , the school looks dreary and dark , sometimes rather bland . Dark can be good ,but it is not very magical. The movie is too long too, perhaps no longer than the others, but it feels longer. It drags , jumping between sections it seems as though there's three movie in here instead of one . After watching the movie I learned that "" Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery. "" . If you are a Harry Potter fan you're going to love it but those who are not should consider to go to watch twice ! It's too long in places , and drags when it should soar. It's rated PG- 13. Instead goblet of fire kind of lives between PG and PG-13, one not-so-grizzly death less and it probably would have been PG . Overall, this is a good movie a fun movie , with the addition of new characters,the fast paced natural of the film, and the added romantic aspects ! Rating : ****",1
1807,8.0,"I must confess, I haven't read any of the books but I think that the series of films have got better as they have progressed.",1
1808,10.0,"This is a brilliant adaptation of the book. The feel is dark and gritty and not for the very young. It continues in the vein of the last film. Meaning that there is more darkness and shadows instead of the bright colors of the first two films. The only important part of the book left out is the whole dispute between the Ron's family and his brother Percy. This makes the film more Harry-centered which is okay, but disappointing for true book fans. Ralph Fiennes is incredibly scary and convincing as Lord Voldermort. I kept wondering how Voldermort could be done. His voice is both eerie in its gentleness making it sound soft and snake-like. And his make-up is perfect.",1
1809,3.0,"This movie is simply a bastardization of the book. There's no more to it than that. Just about every scene that had me riveted to the pages in the novel drowned in cheesy dialog, bad acting, and/or extreme modification. If you are planning on seeing this movie, at least spare yourself the ruination of an amazing experience and read the book first. Even if you hate reading, you'll like this book. Besides, if you haven't read the book you won't have a clue as to what the hell is going on in the story anyway because the movie jumps around from scene to scene so confusingly.",0
1810,9.0,"I am of a demographic age that many wonder why I would love this series so to that, I just enjoy when Holloywood makes things come to life that you just can't see everyday and this one fits the bill. Before I gush on about this installment pros and cons, the thing I want to put out there in a series of consistent characters is Dubeldore. Please cast a new one for the last of the Movies? Why- Know one did a better job than the 1st two in the series, the untimely death vexed this series but this new guy just does not cut it. The first Dumbeldore in the book and on screen acted as if he was a Master Chess player knowing the moves of the players before they knew it themselves and his affinity for Harry and warmth was a genuine Father/Son, this new guy seems like an idiot compared to the first, the characters themselves seem not even to revere him and his detachment to Harry is evident. In the book he does detach a bit as events unfold but always has great concern for his young pupil. I have not felt that warmth in 3 or 4. His leadership lacks, no sense of strength from the Headmaster and most gifted wizard should have which is sorely missed out of this Dumbledore. Cast anew, Pleeease! Now the Movie: I loved the original, enjoyed the second and was a tad disappointed in Azkaban, but I was refreshed a bit in the 4th installment, I reviewed and heard many talk at the theater that it was not Askaban but I liked this one and thought it was a bit better. Humor, some darkness and a overall reflection of the tone of the book and series were represented. Many complained about the length, I thought the story moved well and did not feel as I watched like ""when is this going to end"" the tempo seemed fair enough between action and character development. It has been a while since I read Goblet but it seemed to have its spirit. While many thought the acting of Ray Fienes brought credibility, I was somewhat disappointed, he did well but not shocking well! It will be good to see how he evolves the character in the later installments. Many complained about 24 year olds dating 14 in the movie, they forget Harry, Ron and Harmonee are about 14 years old while the later class-men are about 17, last I checked a Junior could date a freshman for a dance and not get to much grief about it. Here is to the next in it series, I hope it is summer 2006, if not, I am sure this DVD will tie me over, it is worth the price of admission, those that complain just don't get that movies are to be enjoyed on the whole and not to be cut like a surgeon's knife. I think too many just like to complain, I for one like to go to get away and enjoy movies! Pass the popcorn and enjoy the show!",1
1811,5.0,"Now, although I may not have rated this film very high, believe me, I am a BIG Harry Potter fan and did truly enjoy the movie. My only problem was that if I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't have known what was going on.",1

I think it is definitely the best so far! It even has lots of good humor in it so its not so uptight. It was funny and witty and actually shows the better side of the story which is humor, friendship, and love, that I'm sure J.K. takes a lot of time putting in. It was long, and parts jump but it was just amazing. They made sure all the important things were put in, and parts of the movie were even put it word for word.

I saw the movie (finally) today (we in Aus had to wait an extra 2 weeks after the US and UK - so not fair), and to my great pleasure I can say that you will not be disappointed... Whilst the start tends to chop and change (only the first 10 or so minutes), the rest of the movie flows well and I was quite surprised (in a good way) by just how much of the book they kept in the movie... Given the (relatively) short running time - 2hr25mins.. I expected that a LOT would be cut out... but the script writer Steve Kloves and the director Mike Newell have really done a great job in carrying the essence of the book into the film... Whilst there have been some changes to scenes in the book, they make perfect sense and one can easily see why they did it that way (time constraints, new audience confusion, etc). Part thriller/Part comedy/and Part action, this movie has it all... the darkness-o-meter has been cranked up a notch this time around, and trust me, this is no kids movie. So do yourself a favour and go and see this film, it's a great adaptation of a great book and that's all that matters!! 9/10... I can't wait to go see it again.",1
1815,8.0,"Harry Potter was good. Scene by Scene it was masterful. Continuity, however, does suffer and the transitions are poor. The production is feeling the lost of Richard Harris and though Michael Gambon does a good job of stepping in, I feel he lacks the grace and spirit of Richard Harris. Another problem is the all to frequent director changes the production has undergone. Though the third film was able to overcome these obstacles, Goblet of Fire has more difficulty doing so owing to the excessive nature of the book. Sorry if this is a bit long I just didn't feel right giving criticisms without making an attempt to justify them. It is still a very good film and enjoyable. It is definitely worth seeing.",0
1816,10.0,"Having watched the new installment of Harry Potter, HP and The Goblet of Fire, I am extremely impressed by the quality of the film. JK Rowling's novel is already a phenomenal masterpiece and the movie proves itself to be a masterpiece of its genre.The past 3 movies were wonderfully done and the new one just adds up to the list. Mike Newell's new approach on the novel's adaptation works really well especially the humor part which gives a relief from the drama and suspense of the film. Although several of the scenes from the book weren't included ; which is totally understandable, the viewers were left with over two hours long of pure entertainment.",1
1817,3.0,So I'm a big fan of the books and I think they did a great job with the FIRST THREE movies. The fourth movie is a DISAPPOINTMENT. Thats why I rated it as a three. There were parts I liked but not many. I'll probably go see it again so I can complain about it with friends. I didn't have anything bad to say about the first three movies but I could go on forever on this one. I just wish people would give up on thinking that this series is for kids. Maybe young teens but not kids. I was really glad to see more of Fred and George. There were some characters I would've liked to see again. I was looking forward to certain parts that they changed horribly or left out all together. Disappointing.,0
1818,10.0,"Just a small goof or two. Rita Skeeter insists on depicting Harry as a mere boy of twelve in her articles, but the headlines of the articles read ""teenage tragedy"". Perhaps alliteration is more important than basic math? Also, Harry makes the statement, ""Here we are, four years later."" If they are presently in their fourth year, then here they are indeed, but actually only THREE years ""later"". These and other ""goofs"" as pointed out by the esteemed members of IMDb, however, do not in my opinion take away from the general entertainment value of the movie. My six year old has seen it three times and keeps begging to go back again. It has been a wonderful fun ride each time. Apologies to all of the book fans who feel ""cheated"" and that certain key elements were left out. If you want an exact replay of the book, then I suggest reading the book again. Good luck, however keeping your children attentive for seven hundred pages. On the other hand, if you want great cinematography, engaging characters, stunning visuals, and good clean family entertainment packed into a three hour family outing, then go see this movie. Thanks for reading!",1
1819,10.0,"Goblet of Fire starts of with a snake coming out of a skull, slowly passing the angel of death. Straight of the start you know this is going to be a dark film. The PG-13 rating is not an understatement. There are some scenes that will haunt young children. Although anyone above 12 is safe enough to watch it. Enough about the ratings and themes. Big question is...how was it? Well it was sooo disappointing...no i'm joking. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! A few flaws but it was awesome!!! Mike Newell clearly knows the Harry Potter universe and i hope he comes back for the last film. The acting was absolutely superb! Daniel Radcliffe was amazing. How he improved so much i do not know but he will amaze you.",1
1820,10.0,"I loved this movie it was the best one so far and the funniest! For those of you that don't want to see it for the fear of spoiling your view on Harry's World don't worry it won't it will just broaden your thoughts on what you think of it. I have to say Voldemort looks wicked awesome and Ralph Fienes is Awesome! Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown so much in the past films and continue to. Harry is finding love and Ron is trying to hide from it. Hermione is finding love in a shall we say weird place.",1
1821,10.0,"It wasn't true to the book entirely, but you can't expect that of a book that was around 800 pages long! It made an excellent movie! Although it was very long, none of the time in the movie was wasted or pointless; everything was important. The director and actors did a very good job of explaining things about what was going on for people who have not read the book. My only problem with it was that it had unnecessary aspects for which it was rated PG-13, such as random cursing, which didn't seem very Harry Potterish. Other than that, I would recommend it to anybody. If you like action, but aren't sure if Harry Potter is your ""scene"", this would be a great movie to get you hooked and to make you anxious for the movie for The Order of the Phenox to come out! Very highly recommended!",0
1822,9.0,"I think this was a GREAT movie! I recently saw it, and they did an excellent job. Definitely worth seeing, although they missed out some parts from the book. They added a lot of great special effects, like the dragons and the pensieve. The new actors did a great job as well, and the old actors are still doing great. It was scary, funny, and interesting. The funny part of the movie is when Harry is trying to ask a girl out to the Yule Ball, and we see how hard it is for him, since Ron says that Harry can slay dragons but he can't ask a girl out. I wouldn't recommend the movie for young kids because it does get scary in some parts, with the dragons and in the end of the book. I personally enjoyed it, although it gets a bit boring in some parts. Overall, i give it a 9/10 and i hope that people will watch it!",1
1823,10.0,"There are too many naysayers in this world. I thought Goblet of Fire was by far the best Harry Potter movie to date. Yes, a lot was left out... to the people who complain about that I say, ""You have at least SEEN the book, right?"" Goblet of Fire is a long book. Yes, it's a great book (they all are), but of course a lot of stuff is going to be left out. Who wants to see a five hour movie, regardless of what the movie is? Nobody, that's right. The point is, it's a MOVIE that's 2 &1/2 hours long. The book has 734 pages. If you're upset that things were left out, then don't go see movies that are based upon books ever again! Okay, now that my rant is over... like I was saying, Goblet of Fire is by far the best one to date. The Triwizards Championship was amazing, it was absolutely heart-wrenching to see Hermione with Viktor (her and Ron just need to get together already!), and the scene with Harry and Voldemort... let's just say that because I knew what was going to happen, I started crying the second the four of them went into the maze, and I didn't stop until the credits. Cedric was such a good character (not to mention hot), they really should have put more of Cedric in there... I was disappointed they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup... I was sure that was going to be amazing. Despite the things that were left out, I was in awe the entire time. I can't wait for Order of the Phoenix...",1
1824,10.0,"After re-reading the book, I was disappointed with some of the plot lines being left out. With that being said, I thought the movie really played up the important parts of the book; the tasks, the relationships between the trio and the adults, and other things I won't mention. I was awed by the film, despite the minor changes and omissions. Definitely the best Harry Potter film yet (and I am a HUGE fan of the third film). The scene underwater was frighteningly real to me. Even knowing that it all turns out well wasn't enough for me to feel comfortable. Very welled acted, directed and shot. The sets were, as always, fantastic. This film is a definite must see for anyone who loves Harry Potter.",1
1825,6.0,"I've read lots of the reviews here and I'm in the middle. Yes, it was long-awaited and it was a great book, and it's Harry Potter, so it's defacto great. And it sure has taken in a lot of money, so people are obviously liking it - and I did too. But if you know the book and the books (and therefore movies) that come after it - it was way too short, and left out so much, and added some very silly things and wasted time on others. I like one reviewer's idea that it should have been released as two movies a few months apart. I also agree with the comment that whoever adapted this one has no feel for the characters and the deeper story at all.",1
1826,10.0,"Just got back from seeing the movie and I absolutely loved it!! There's a lot missing from the books, but they made it work perfectly. It was funny, a little bit darker, and just visually stunning. I thought Prisoner of Azkaban was going to be my favorite, but this one blew it away. ",1
1827,10.0,"I think this is the best one so far. The action is getting better with each movie, and the kids have become really fabulous actors! I really loved the first task. I am so impressed with the fall Harry took off the roof of the castle. But my favorite scene is in the graveyard. They couldn't have chosen a better Voldemort!! And the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort was awesome! The only negative thing I have to say is that it should have been at least 3 1/2 hours long!!! I don't understand why they insist on keeping it down to only 2 1/2 hours. I don't know a single fan who would object to a longer movie. I also hope that they get John Williams back to do the music for the remaining movies. No one else can compare with him. All in all, I LOVED it!!",1
1828,9.0,"I thought this was the most enjoyable of all of the movies, with one complaint. The score was NOT up to the standard set in the first three. It was unengaged, and had very little impact on the emotion of the film. Moments which should have had me in emotional anguish (Cedric's death, Voldemort's rebirth, Harry's conversation with his parents, too many to mention really) felt totally emotionally detached, and this from a guy who cries at sappy commercials.",1
1829,10.0,This movie is amazing.,1
1830,,It is very difficult to cram a 400+ page book into a two hour movie. I have read some (bad)reviews of the movie by people who have obviously not read the book or are familiar with the characters. I would be hard pressed to understand the movie had I not read the books and seen the previous films.,0
1831,6.0,"Some find it fantastic, others not so fantastic. I am not the only person to find this film quite disappointing. Many fans of J.K. Rowling would consider it rushed and not true to the book. The first two films were great. Hogwarts looked the same and so did the uniforms. Suddenly Hogwarts looked different in the third film. The courtyard changed, a bridge appeared, The Whomping Willow changed positions (and size), the Fat Lady changed actresses, Hagrid's hut changed position and the uniforms appeared in a different design. In the first film, Hermione's hair was true to the book - big and bushy. In the second film, it was still long, but no longer bushy and instead in crimps. By the third film, her hair had been cut short and was in messy curls. But by The Goblet of Fire, the films have changed completely. The Quidditch pitch is on a rocky cliff, and Hogwarts is built on the side of a mountain. Some major characters and elements were cut from the film. What happened to Dobby and Hermione's SPEW obsession? What happened to Ludo Bagman? The whole film was rushed to a halt at the graveyard in the third task. The dreadful screenplay hides the good acting, of Emma Watson in particular. If a book such as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is to be made into a film, it should be done to its best. If making two films was necessary in order to end up with a good result, it should have been done. People expect so much work to go into the Harry Potter films. Staying true to the book is so important. I hope the fifth film can live up to fans' expectations.",0
1832,8.0,"My first reaction to this movie was: amazing! The actors acted very well (except Michael Gambon, I'll come back on that later), the visual effects were great and it was just a strong, catchy movie. But it was, as a big fan of the Potter books, horrible to see how the book was suppressed. The main scenes, like the hearing and th return of Voldemort, are made shorter to add more humour to the movie. I wanted to see more scenes as the hearing, and less jokes, that had made the movie much better.",0
1833,6.0,"I recently was able to attend a screening, and after the first few sequences I knew Mike Newell and the screenwriter had messed it up. I know it would be impossible to preserve all the greatness of the thick book into one movie, but from the beginning the biggest problem is clear - they cut many things that they should not have, and greatly embellished scenes that did not need them.",0
1834,5.0,"I found the special effects were just as fantastic as I expected, but I thought the music was a little overdone and sappy when it didn't have to be. The acting was a fantastic ensemble piece with each of the many main characters having several times when they come to the forefront. I did notice, however great the rest of the acting, that Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) at times was moving far too quickly and with too much alacrity to portray Dumbledore as old as the books make him sound. At one point he leaps rather quickly on to the platform where the teachers sit to go to his podium, and another time when agitated he sits and stands up very quickly. I also think it's a bit extreme when he shakes Harry because it seemed rather uncharacteristically physical and bordering on violent for him to do that. I thought that there were several loose ends left with the reduction of the subplots from the book, such as not seeing how Barty Crouch Jr. got out of Azkaban. The movie seemed a little too plot-driven at times and skipped out on the characterization of the new characters like Fleur and Krum. Some of the dialogue seemed rather stilted, but the ending duel, when Harry takes Cedric Diggory's body back, and Dumbledore's comments about Cedric's death were truly moving. Overall, I think that fans of the movies more than the books will like this better than those who truly love the books.",1
1835,8.0,"I am not a fan of the HP universe, but this movie had one particular scene that touched me.",0
1836,1.0,"I've never read nor have I seen any of the Harry Potter books or the previous movies, but having heard all positive comments regarding them I went to see this movie. Half way through the movie, I realized that because I didn't read the book, most of the movie did not make any sort of sense to me. I also got the feeling that they cut out VAST amounts of plot from the book, so much that the movie just felt like a vague outline of an otherwise (maybe) enjoyable story. Scene development were terrible to the point that MANY events went unexplained. Maybe to the elementary school kids, this is OK, but as an educated college student, it frustrated me to no ends. To top off a movie with no plot continuity, the ending made absolutely no attempt to salvage anything and ended on an extremely bland and lifeless note.",0
1837,10.0,"I loved this movie!!I was however a little disappointed that certain important things had been left out, like Winky for example and the Dursleys, BUT you can't compare the movie to the book, because you will be disappointed!! obviously they cant put everything in and I think no matter what they do people are never going to be happy with the result!! So not comparing the book to the movie I thought it was great, really good special effects, people always play a part way younger than they actually are so I think Daniel, Rupert, and Emma did a good job at convincing the public they were 14 year old!! and I can't wait for the next one! Its going to be so good!",1
1838,6.0,"I find it quite surprising how such a visual book can be so poorly made into a film.Prisoner of azkaban in my opinion was the best so far and I guess it all comes down to a good screenplay and of coarse the director.Which is another surprise for me;mike Newell has made really good movies,what happened with harry potter??? Anyway,if you can't or won't make a 5-hour movie and instead you're gonna make a too highly-paced one of 2 and a half hours(still bloody long),then why do it at all?! Here's my idea:make 2 movies and release them a month apart from each other. If goblet was squeezed into 2 and a half,then i'll dread what they're gonna do to order of the phoenix!! Please,director and screenwriter,don't screw up??",0
1839,9.0,"I just saw this movie tonight after months of anticipation, and I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. So much of the book was left out and it really did make a difference. The way that things were skipped, it seemed to make the movie choppy in spots. I think that some things could have been left in, and made the movie even better than it was, even if it would have added another 30 minutes or so to the movie. An example would be Rita Skeever. In the book, she is a major character, and in the movie, she just seems to be a minor annoyance, so much more could have been done with the character, it was a bit of a letdown.",0
1840,9.0,"I went to see the first showing of the film at midnight which just added to the excitement of it all. In a cinema filled full of only adults there were laughs, gasps and shocks. The film follows the book through the Riddle House to the Quidditch World Cup, to the Hogwarts Express and then to Hogwarts and the Triwizard Tournament. We arrive at Hogwarts with the 'cheerleaders' from Beaubatons Academy and the 'bad boys' from Durmstrangs Institute. These being the two other schools competing in the Tournament.",1
1841,4.0,IT sucked there are important parts in the book that was not in the movie but are mentioned again in later books and need to be in there so if you haven't read the books and have seen the movie you need to read the book. there is nothing about Rita Skeeter being an animagus and no house elves and the tasks are all messed up the movie is mainly just tasks and like nothing else. Sirus is hardly in it. In my opinion it just sucked. The beginning of the movie where they are at the Quidditch match there aren't any veela or leprechauns and no Ludo Bagman and no leprechaun gold no goblins and they didn't go to the top box with the Malfoys and they didn't go to Hagrids after the last task and talk about what Hagrid was going to do over the summer and there wasn't anything about Kakaroff leaving or about Krum and his classmates having to steer and nothing about Hagrid being a giant I think they should have made two movies and released them at separate times like they were going to do originally.,0
1842,8.0,"This review has spoilers, but we're all Harry Potter fans and have read the books, RIGHT? So read on! My review's blunt. Just to tell you now.",0
1843,1.0,"to all those who have read the book have to agree on that this movie stunk. they left out so many characters that i looked forward to seeing such as (and these are just a few) Dobby, Winky, Charlie Weasley, Bill Weasely, Molly Weasely, The Dursleys and so many more important people. Basically this movie had no background characters to support the main theme. They left out the scene where harry and his friends where under the impervious and they left out that Hagrid was Half Giant, but most importantly they left out the Weasely's Wizard Wheezes. Harry Didn't get to see any of their inventions in the movie, nor did he give them his gold (im not even sure that he got his gold) in other words, this movie stunk like crud.",0
1844,8.0,"The movie was too short for the story and there were many mistakes like harry's dream in the beginning that he was in the drzleys house but in the movie he was at Ron's house,in the maze Krum attacked Sedric,but in the film Sedric attacked Krum and in the end of the maze spider attacked on Harry and almost broke Harry's foot, but in the movie there wasn't any spider and his foot was fine,I like Harry Potter very much his every movie and the book,but the movie was not perfect it was fine.",1
1845,10.0,"This is for sure a MUST SEE!! Whoever haven't sent this movie is really missing out...its the most amazing movie i've seen. The best potter movie yet!! its a real thriller....its SO good!!!!! gets you right into the action..and makes you feel like part of the movie. THE BEST MOVIE YET.This movie starts off giving you info. since the beginning of the movie..and it keeps going! it doesn't stop! its problem after problem, tensity after tensity!, joke after joke! The movie is just simply filled with the best of Harry Potter. And for sure the movie if VERY close to what the book says. And that makes the movie so much enjoyable for those who already read the book. This movie unlike the others has a lot of comedy added to it. That for sure made the movie more enjoyable and in a way it was a good ""brake"" for us to calm down between the action packed rest of the movie. Again, this is a MUST SEE.",1
1846,3.0,"This movie really disappointed me. I've never been a Harry Potter fan, but I liked the last movie, so I expected this one to be as good or even better from what I'd heard. But it wasn't at all. Heaps of scenes made no sense at all, lots of things were never explained, and I got the feeling the film was only for those who have read the book already. And the plot of the movie was downright stupid. Why would the school have a competition where it was really likely that some of the students would die, just for the entertainment of it? And nobody thought it was a bit strange to almost sacrifice the lives of the competitors friends, also just for some entertainment? Stupid movie, with a stupid story, and lots of loose ends..Some good special effects though..",0
1847,5.0,"This is the best that they could do? I should hope not because though they did an admirable job portraying the Tri-Wizard Tournament which is the general idea of the book they left out so many things that cross apply to the next movies to explain the twins leaving and the abilities that Harry displayed during each of the three trials that it leaves you wondering how they could chop this up so badly. Even at the end when Dumbledore tells Harry why his parents, the grounds-keeper, and Cedric's spirits appeared during the connection of the two wands that is a small indicator of the connection the two, Harry and Voldemort, share. I know that some of you out there are saying that this is a kids movie and it has to be short to keep their attention, but if the movie is kept as great as it is in the visuals and the rest of the story including, the practice room where Harry learns all his spells, the Rita Skeeter animagus connection to explain all of the news reports, the Floo network talks to Sirius, Ron's owl, and the Gift of the winnings to the Twins, not to mention all of the twins joke experiments. All of the above has been left out and if they only would have made an hour longer satisfaction would have been appeased on my part. Don't MISUNDERSTAND THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE BUT FOR ME IT NEEDS TO BE LONGER AND THE KIDS THAT ARE READING THE BOOKS WOULD WATCH THE ENTIRE THING NO PROBLEMS BUT NOW WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE MAKE AN EXTENDED EDITION ON DVD WITH THE HOUR THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE ADDED IN UNFORTUNATELY I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT WILL BE THE CASE. GO WATCH IT AFTER READING THE BOOK AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.",0
1848,9.0,"I really enjoyed the latest instalment of Harry Potter, and found it to be faithful to the book.

Emily Watson or something.",1
1849,7.0,"I am a HUGE fan of the books, which can either be a good or bad thing when it comes to the movies.",0
1850,9.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an amazingly well produced film, although it lacked some key details in the beginning, that would be essential for new viewers/people that have not read the book. For instance, there should have been more of the actual quidich playing in the world cup scene. The last scene, in which Voldemort faced Harry, was particularly dramatic and the music through the film gave a delectable touch to the drama. In my opinion this was the movie most like the book in many respects, as it was the first one (since the Chamber of Secrets) that I found it so like the book that I seemed to think I had already seen it. Deja-vu. Overall the fourth edition to the Harry Potter series was a spectacular merge between digital effects and talented performances.",1
1851,10.0,Wonderful. We've waited so long for this film and I was so thrilled to be able to see it. As a matter of fact I've seen it twice. The film didn't exactly follow the book but all of the really important information was passed on to the viewer. I thought the acting was superb. Daniel Ratcliff has really matured as an actor and gets a big round of applause from me. I love the story. I've read all the books several times and I was so excited to see this film. I can't wait for the next book and for the next film to hit the big screens. I've already requested that Amazon notify me when this movie becomes available on DVD.,1
1852,7.0,"So the movie was pretty good, and fairly accurate. I liked the way Sirius was portrayed in the Fire, I liked the way that they showed Cedric Dying, I like they scene at the end, and I like the Gillyweed thing in the second task.",1
1853,10.0,This movie was brilliantly done and displays an extreme amount of realize and characters that anyone should be able to relate to in some way. Wonderful special effects and the dragon especially is really wonderful on the big screen.,1
1854,10.0,"NOW, this is definitely the best Harry Potter movie so far! But, Tom Fleton (Draco MAlfoy) isn't going to be in anymore more of the movies because he is going to college. All of them have grown up and looked absolutely amazing. The movie followed all of the book, except for a few minor details, but unless like me, you are obsessed with HP, you won't notice. The movie is about 2 1/2 hours long. It got a PG-13 rating for sexual innuendos. There aren't really any, except at the end when Crouch Jr. says to Snape, ""I'll show you mine, if you show me your."" But, he was talking about the Voldemort tattoo. The best scene by far is when Voldemort got remade by Peter Pettigrew. Voldemorts face looked exactly how I pictured it in the book. But, Voldemort's acting is not the best. Another great scene(s) is when they are in the maze. Almost everything was in there. The special effects in this movie are absolutely amazing!",1
1855,10.0,"Saw the movie a couple of hours ago... I really liked it, even though much from the books were not there I can understand that it would become a far to long movie to make if everything in the book were in the movie. ",0
1856,10.0,"I saw the newest Harry Potter movie on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00 pm I think. I don't remember lol. I was thinking of couple things before the movie started, acting, special effects and the directing of the movie. Halfway through the movie I thought it was just alright until I saw the true acting when Harry, Ron and Hermione were all fighting. You could think it was a big emotional scene. That's what people look for in these movies (also action.) The directing was outstanding. Mike Newell showed lots of the Castle in this movie (some things were changed though which no one really cares.) Special Effects were cool. Special Effects were 100% perfect in this onebut the other special effects in the last 3 were okay too. The music was outstandinglike always, John Williams is always at his best with the theme,Patrick Doyle also did outstanding job when it comes to movies like these. I rate this movie 10 out of 10. Now...I can't wait to see the next one.",1
1857,5.0,"I have to agree... I was disappointed too. I thought the Quidditch World Cup was cut way too short - that could have been spectacular! Not a house elf in sight, major discrepancies between the book and movie regarding Crouch (and Crouch Jr.), and OH MY GOD the maze scene (3rd task)...?? Where were the blast ended skrewts, sphynxs, funky mist etc. I also noticed all of the humour and sexual tension that seemed to be more apparent than it actually was at this point of the series (and there was very little character development outside of Harry, Hermione, Ron and Neville Longbottom). Oh and what about Rita Skeeter and Sirius?? Hmmm... okay so I know there was a LOT, way too much, than could have been put in, but it seems that just clips of the best parts were shown instead of actually creating a story and great characters to follow.",0
1858,7.0,"I think, had I not read the books already (and, mind you, I read them all in between seeing HP3 and this film), I would have enjoyed the movie more. The special effects are as spectacular as one would expect, but there is no meat on these bones. All the major plot lines from the book are diluted or left entirely out of the movie. One can't expect a 6 hour movie, but it feels more like Cliff's Notes with a few major special effects sequences thrown in.",0
1859,,"I saw this film a while back and absolutely loved it. It has all the things a film should have: humour, romance and...action. Many of the sequences were brilliantly done and its a good film for fans to watch. On the other hand people who have not read the Harry Potter books may not understand the film and see it as a long sequence of scenes. Not much is from the book, but it delivers as a film for the fans.",1
1860,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an exciting and well made movie. Because of the size of the book, the decision was made to focus on Harry and his challenges, including the one with budding romance, which meant a great deal of trimming from the storyline of the book. Director Mike Newell's vision of this chapter of the continuing Harry Potter saga is flawless as he applies just the right touches to give the viewer the sense of danger and darkness along with a masterful sprinkling of humor amid both serious and embarrassing moments. Over all the movie is excellent and the special effects masterful. 2 thumbs up!",1
1861,6.0,"Or else you might miss half the plot. The newest installment of the Harry Potter series moves at such lightening speed that the audience hardly settles into one mind-blowing, spectacular, special effects-laden scene before it whisks you away to the next. It seems that director Mike Newell was going for quantity over quality, trying to fit as much of the book into the film as possible, but never slowing down enough to give the audience a chance to feel the tone of the movie or read into the depth of the characters. Granted Newell was facing a challenge from the beginning with J.K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter book weighing in at some 734 pages; however, he barely took advantage of the book's exquisite detail when making this film. The budding romantic tendencies of the adolescents were of course portrayed thoroughly on screen, but deeper relationships, such as the growing paternal bond between Sirius Black and Harry, were merely glossed over. Also, viewers who have never actually read Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will probably be stumped over the mechanics of Barty Crouch Jr.'s kidnap and impersonation of Mad Eye Moody. Adequate explanation of this key plot element is sorely lacking.",0

1863,10.0,"I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books so whenever a movie comes out based on one of the 6 novels there's definitely pressure on the director to make the movies live up to the books. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire definitely did that. This movie was amazing! It's over 2 and a half hours but trust me the time flies by! I loved how the new director really captured the fact that the characters are growing up and dealing with regular teenage problems like dating and friendship almost exactly as it was written. I also loved the fact that even though certain characters, like Ludo Bagman, had to be cut out, and originals like Malfoy and Snape had no more then a cameo, the movie flowed so perfectly that you didn't even notice they weren't there. The movie is visually stunning and the scenes outside during the winter and at the Quidditch World Cup and Triwisard tournament are gorgeous! The stadium scene at the Quidditch World Cup was very cool to watch and I was impressed. ",1
1864,8.0,"Like most other people, I believe that this one is the best one yet. In the movie, there were a whole lot of cuts to keep within the film's 2 and a half hour running time. As a result, the movie's details vary quite greatly from the book, although the film's core remains faithful.",0
1865,9.0,"This movie was INCREDIBLE! While it does not stay completely true to the books, Mike Newell (director) did a fantastic job. It is the most humorous but at the same time quite dark. The actors have grown so much in their abilities of acting from the first movie, it is quite astonishing. Daniel Radcliffe especially, who is absolutely stunning in this movie. His ability to evoke emotion has greatly improved since the 'Prisoner of Azkaban.' The casting for this time around was awesome. Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, WOW! She does a fantastic job. The other three Tri-Wizard Champions were also quite amazing, I must say. This movie made me laugh, cry, nearly-shout and above all feel the magic that truly is Harry Potter.",1
1866,5.0,"This movie had so much potential and did indeed prove that the series of movies is worth waiting for, but this one could have been so much better. ",0
1867,9.0,"Hey guys!! As a Harry Potter fan I have no way to say that the movie is not good. It is an excellent movie. After all the story line behind it is very good. The only problem I found with the movie was the lack of time to take it in a well organized fashion. The duration of 2 hours and 30 mins. is not enough to include all the critical scenes which were originally written by J.K.Rowling. But I still think that the director did a very good job in keeping the audience interest alive through out the movie. The sequences of Triwizard tournament should have been a little more clear. When it comes to the Return of the King: LOTR series, the movie was well over 3 hrs.. The Warner Bros. should have done the same thing. By taking a little more time and trying to explain things in a better fashion could have been even better. The people who did not read the books but are interested in movies were a little confused at some points. The people who read the books very well like me...were disappointed a little when some important scenes were missing. But over all the movie was good. The teen element was shown in a good way.

1868,3.0,"I was unfortunately disappointed by this film installment. I really enjoyed The Prisoner of Azkaban, and felt it really worked for people who did and did not read the book. It felt whole and coherent, though obviously a lot of stuff had to get dropped in order for that to work.",0
1869,10.0,"brilliant absolutely brilliant! i watched this film along with the other 3 and loved them all and i cant wait to see the order of phoenix when it comes out!! if you haven't seen this film already i really recommend watching it as it is really exciting, breath-taking and totally awesome in every possible way. my sister loves harry potter and the goblet of fire as she's a very big harry potter fan and has read all the books, when she first saw harry potter she was gob-smacked, when we left the cinema the first thing she said to me was ""that was totally AMAZING!!!!"" and begged me to go and see it again with her. i am dreading when the order of phoenix comes out on DVD... as i don't know how my sister will react! lets just all hope she doesn't grasp the fact that it hasn't come out on DVD and is just seeing things.",1

Easily the best movie in the series to date, GOBLET gives us a sweet and poignant coming-of-age story wrapped in a roller-coaster, big-budget, no-holds-barred FX spectacular.",1
1871,10.0,"I went to catch the Malaysian Premiere a few weeks ago and I have to say it was more than just FANTASTIC!!! The special effects was definitely the best effects the Harry Potter Saga had ever shown.I have been a die hard fan before this and to tell the truth I was expecting it to be quite low since tons of parts had been cut.Clearly,I was wrong.Mike Newell did a fine job.The actors had definitely grown into very very good actors.Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job with his emotions and action.Emma Watson is now a beautiful young lady and Rupert Grint did amazing face expressions.The jokes were very funny there was definitely chemistry between Watson and Grint.The new casts like Stanislav Ianevski,Clemence Poesy,Robert Pattinson and Katie Leung are also applaudable.Ianevski is perfect for Viktor Krum with his accent and body while Poesy and Pattinson were good actors and exceptionally good looking.Poesy carried Fleur Delacour like a true veela,perfection and poised.Leung,although a small part,played Cho Chang very nicely.Stunts were all amazing and the sets was Magnificent.Look forward to Yule Ball sets and 1St TASKS's stunts.",1
1872,4.0,"While the Harry Potter series may be best-selling books, the movies made about the series are not nearly as good as they ought to be. The first few movies were alright at best, and with reason. The three previous movies all had things in common with the books; all three were relatively short. The fourth (Goblet of Fire) was quite a bit longer than the other three leading to serious film-making problems. Even with the movie being over two hours long, so much was left out from the book that the story line was compromised. Fellow moviegoers that had not touched a copy of the book had no idea about what was going on in the plot. The plot was further compromised by added scenes which barely pulled the movie out of the gutter with comedy. Not only will I not recommend this movie to other people, but I will advise people against spending entirely too much money on a movie that relies on the book it's based on to promote itself.",0
1873,1.0,"I love the books write, the movies was the most stupidest not even scary thing ever! it wasn't even scary! I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing it as its very stupid! Who ever likes this movie is crazy, and boring. I thought the first 3 were OK but first the Daniel guy is UGLY! man they need a hot harry potter (I'm allowed to like him cause I'm only like 13) and I look my cousin who's 8 along and even he said it was pathetic, and whoever thinks its scary is CRAZY! its like sooo boring and not scary and if you think it is scary you need to get out some HORRORS not baby kids movies. And by the way THE MOVIES IS -10/10 not just 1",0
1874,10.0,"This movie is excellent, even if the time line depicted is a little crunched. It is darker than the other three, but also has many light moments. The comedic sections are very funny, while the more serious parts cannot be mistaken for anything else. It is definitely not straight from the book, but is close enough that a reader knows what is going on. However, some characters are not in the movie which have fairly large roles in the book. They may have been cut for time, but a lot of people may not have cared how long the movie was. All in all, even though there are some disappointing parts, this movie is great and I would see it again. (Actually, I'm going to)",1
1875,9.0,"As a first timer of the Harry Potter series of movies I was skeptical because this was suppose to be one of the more interesting films due to some very dreadful things that occur. Understandably more of the true fans are more concerned to the authenticity of the movies as it becomes translated from text but overall in the cinema aspect they did a wonderful job telling a story with wonderful visual effects. The story stands great alone if you never see another film in the series. Even if this is the only movie you see, you can enjoy it whole heartedly and become intertwined into the characters and realize that this isn't just for kids. Definitely worth the 7 hour wait in line with other potter heads. PS ERICKA ROCKS!",1
1876,9.0,"Fantastic film, though there were parts that weren't explained enough from poor editing and missing links. Plus parts that were quite enjoyable in the book, were: Ron's new pet Pigweidgon, Mad Eye Moody- teaching harry for the ""Triwizard Tournument"" (such spells of 'Accio'), the Hogsmeade trip. The beginning was quite different this time, with no mention of Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia. As most people would agree that the book is much different to the movie, but as a reader and fan of the book, i must say the movie is not really different, but gives a fantastic and sumptuous view/visualization of the film. The scenery and the enjoyment of the new characters. Eg. Mad Eye Moody and his wicked eye and sense of black humor or crazy humor and Rita Skeeter's annoyance with newspaper journalism. Though unlike Mike Newell, he uses a different composer for music and a different feel or outline towards the film. very different to Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuarón adaptation, but overall a must see!",1
1877,8.0,Movie was awesome even if it missed parts of the book. I was not impressed with the quiditch world cup part of the movie. But the showdown in the graveyard was cool with the prior incantatum. Also would have been nice if they had little Bill & Charlie Weasley appear in this movie. Very much looking forward to Order of the Pheonix next year. Can't wait for the ministry battle scene and how that is going to look on film. Wondering about how much they will have to cut out of the movie if not it might be like 5 hours long. Many might not complain but we all know that 2.5 hours is usually approaching the limit 3 max. Oh well it will be cool either way. Wondering if all the cast will return for that movie or not since i have heard rumours that Dan Ratliff may not want to be Harry Potter for life.,1
1878,3.0,"Being an adult Potter fan, I waited to write this review until I saw the movie a couple of times to get a good feel for it. Why a couple when I gave it such a low rating? Because I was very disappointed with the movie the first time I saw it.",0
1879,10.0,Harry Potter is a series of events which amaze me its similar to the lemony snicket series but has more excitement for example the tri-wizard tournament were harry has to battle a dragon with just a broomstick and a wand! Hermione and Ron seem to be a good role model for children nowadays. I have become so attracted to the series i have all the books and all the movies apart from 'Harry potter and the goblet of fire'. The books may seem different to the films but the books are around 400 pages and more and would take too long to process in a movie. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 because the graphics and the realness of all the characters and creatures. Children or adults should love it!,1
1880,10.0,"I admit that I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series- books & films. I loved the previous 3 films but I thought they left out some important points in the last one. There is a lot of information to cover from the book and I think they did a great job fine tuning it to this brilliant work of film mastery. The scenery and incredible graphics took my breath away. I get excited every time a Harry Potter film starts and I hear that music. The films are well worth the wait each time. Note to parents, this film is a bit darker and more mature, so if your child is not old enough to read the books on their own, I suggest this movie will be a bit too scary for them.",1
1881,7.0,"I am not denying the fact this film was brilliant and the special effects were fantastic, yet i could not help but feel disappointed by the lack of attention to detail, yes i realise that would make a 10 hour film, but such little things like slightly more emphasis on the match, which i was looking forward to, with the Veela and team mascots. Instead i find the Veela are particularly normal looking girls who don't have the intense effect as described in the book. In the first film attention to such little things as the assorted beans were a delightful touch. I also find that Voldermort was oddly normal looking with a menacing nose, another let down. The fights with the dragon was superb and would have loved to see the rest of the fights, but lack of time wouldn't of allowed it. Although true to the story, people who have read the book will agree, there was so much plot and so little of the magic anymore. A slight let down. 7 out of 10.",1
1882,10.0,"This movie is obviously from beginning to end the greatest harry potter movie yet. With a compelling story to tell and new characters it is far better than expected. I even enjoyed the comedy and normally i'm not the person to laugh easily. Not to mention that Emma Watson has blossomed into a beautiful young woman including the other young women who make for compelling love interest between Hermione and viktor krum. This movie is sure to be an enjoyable experience for all ages harry potter fan or not. I myself am a harry potter fan and was only angry at how harry was not shown at the dursleys this year which I later found out was due to scheduling conflicts with the actors who play Dudley,uncle Vernon,and aunt petunia. I'm sure even if you hate the books you'll love the movie.",1
1883,10.0,Hi. Just forget anything you've read that say bad about the film. Its great. There's something for everyone. Even the people i went with are not harry potter fans but they all enjoyed it. The tri wizard tournament tasks are really well put together and action packed. Its incredibly entertaining. The movie is also the funniest and balances the very dark from the hilarious. However it can seem a bit drawn out at times but the amazing feel of the film makes you not even notice it. The Voldemort scene at the end is one of the greatest cinema scenes i have ever seen . It will blow you away. Emma Watson Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe all have grown exceptionnaly well in their acting skill. ALso Fred George Neville and Ginny finally have some decent screen time. The new additions to the cast are also great. Madame Maxime Fleur Krum and Cedric are great. However Crouch seemed out of character. I was also disappointed with the lack of playtime at the Quidditch match. The dragon task was probably the best but the lake is close behind it. I wish there were some monsters in the maze but there wasn't. Its an amazing movie that Will make you laugh cry gasp scream and cheer. Th best one yet.,1
1884,8.0,"I finally saw the new Harry Potter movie last night. I had my doubts as to how good the movie would be considering that the book is 734 pages and the movie was less than 2.5 hours. But I have to admit in comparison to other the movies, this one is probably the best. There were practically no slow scenes. It stayed packed with action and humor the entire time and remained as true to the book as it could considering the time restriction. I particularly enjoyed when the Durmstrang boys arrived at Hogwarts. It was like a cross between some sort of African tribal dance and a Greek step show...very well done. Oh yeah, if anyone else has watch the movie, do the Death Eaters look similar to the KKK to you? Just wondering....",1
1885,3.0,"Had I not read the Goblet of Fire before seeing the movie I am sure I MIGHT have enjoyed it a lot more, unfortunately, I did read it and it made watching the film almost painful. ",0
1886,9.0,"I saw the movie at 9:30 on the day it came out with my friends and I have to say, yes it was a good movie but I was a little disappointed, the plot was basically the same but much more of it has changed than it has in the previous 3 movies. Whether this is because of the change of director or the length of the film i don't no! It is still an excellent film, don't get me wrong, but I expected so much more of it! The ending was very powerful, I was in floods of tears but the beginning, I felt never really excited me. If you haven't read the book I strongly do not suggest you see it as I know 3 people who haven't that could not follow the film at all! Over all an excellent film but it could have been so much better!",1
1887,1.0,"i am an avid member of harry potter club and we went to see it at midnight. after waiting and waiting it starts, how it should supposed too, with harry's dream, but then we find him already at the weaselly's instead of at home with Dudley, we get none of the scene with the ton tongue toffee. Also the caddish world cup was very weak, we don't get to see any of the character set up for , Barty crouch and ludo bag-man. also since we never get to see the Percy as crouch's assistant. also we don't get to see the team mascots and we hardly see any caddish. also the Wesley/ Malory conflict was not there, (which sets up characterization for the death eater scene) because the Wesley's don't sit in the ministers box! also the whole house elf story line is left out which was really disappointing, because it played such a main role in the book, and we never get the whole Barty crouch/ son conflict going on. another thing was that they left out any mad eye snap tension which was odd. also the Draco harry conflict was not there. the nd task was the best part of the movie the cinematography was amazing and its exactly like the book. also there is no classes shown which is quite annoying since thats always on of my favorite parts. another thing that upset me was there was no developing of the twins joke shop. in the end they never even get the galleons. also their were no ha grid Spence like with those crab things none of that happened, no riflers either. the third task sucked, it was a bunch of moving bushes no animals. the voltmeter confrontation was amazingly good, and so was after wards, until moody takes harry, but due to the lack of house elf's it don;t make very much sense that crouch's son just appear's. also i forgot their is no SPEW, which left Hermine's angry sometimes hard to figure it out. the movie was good,but they left out too much i would have rather had it be longer and less effects then what it was.",0
1888,10.0,"It was amazing.O my gawd!!!!!!! It is definitely the best Potter movie thus far. I was very pleased how they dealt with the length of the book. There is so much to put in one movie. I had no idea that they could pull it off so well. Obviously, there is a lot of information and sub plot lines missing, but that is to be expected. Honestly, the movie made me want to re-read all the books again for the umpteenth time!!!!!!",0
1889,9.0,"Now, I have never been a huge fan of the movies because the books have always been vastly superior. That, combined with the disappointment of the first two movies did not give me much hope for this one, but I was blown away by the director's style and the wonderful screenplay. They did a good job cutting scenes to scale down the time of the movie and included somethings that really made this one stand out as the best. Mostly, you come to care about the characters so by the time Cedric died and Harry was tortured, the majority of the theatre was in tears! Also there were many hilarious parts that were either accentuated (or in some cases completely made up) that really added to the entertainment value and balanced out some of the darker scenes. The action sequences were also very good for those of you who like that kind of thing. I think this movie has something for anyone with an imagination, but it may be a little scary to all of the youngsters under 10 out there. Happy viewings!",1
1890,10.0,"Even if you haven't read any of the books or even seen any of the movies I would watch it just for the effects. I went to a 10:00 showing last night and it was fantastic. The special effects are exceptional and the Tri-Wizard Tournament is cool. It is a very dark movie however, but if you like fantasy with a little joke now and then I would go see it. When Lord Voldemort appears he is pretty ghastly but I don't think the movie portrayed him as bad as what the book did. I expected him to be a little more evil. Hermoine is very beautiful especially at the ball. The dancing ladies that come from Beaxbatons are a marvel and their beauty is exceptional. I thought that they could have done a better job with the World Qudditch match as well. All in all this Harry Potter movie is superb and will be a delight for your senses.",1
1891,5.0,More dragon and less reporter might have made it a more expensive but better film of its genre.,0
1892,10.0,"This is the best Harry Potter movie yet. It skips a lot of parts that were in the book, but, after watching the movie, you wonder if the missed parts were needed in the book. This movie runs fluently (I spelled that wrong) and keeps even the ones who know what is going to happen on the edge of their seats. SPOILER DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU KNOW THE ENDING ALREADY: I thought that Lord Voldemort looked exactly like the book described him. Though I do hate the fact that they continuously pronounce that ""t"" that was meant to be silent at the end of his name. Alen Rickman does a great job playing Proffesor Severous Snape. Unfourtunatly, The actor who plays Dumbledore just does not have the right voice that Dumbledore should have.",1
1893,,"Harry's 4th Year Back At Hogwarts is one of the most thrilling of the Harry Potter Films that you will see. With new characters introduced this year, Harry is back in full action, this time with comedy, thrill and emotion. This amazing film kick starts with a trip to the Qudditch World Cup with Harry and his beloved friend, Hermione, Ron, The Weasleys and Cedric Diggory and his father Mr Diggory. The movie this year shows us a new side of Harry and his strengths and he is entered to join the Triwizard competition, even though he is under-age (the limit in the film is 17) Someone has wrote his name on a piece of parchment and thrown it into the goblet of fire. Harry has been told they do not come across to him as a friendly person but to leave him in great peril. We see Harry take on the 3 tasks needed to be completed to win the Triwizard cup and the return of the Dark Lord, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Towards The End Of This Film. A Great Family Movie With Laughter, Sorrow And Scares, A Great Film For All, Even if you don't class it as a 'i'm so cool' film! I enjoyed it and recommend to all! :)",1
1894,5.0,"Ever since the last Harry Potter movie came out I have been waiting for this one. For months my dad and I had been starving for more about the new movie. Getting excited when we saw the trailer. I kept seeing them and it seemed no other Harry Potter was going to be like this one. No other Harry Potter was going to be as good as this one. It was making me mad that the movie wasn't out yet. Now finally, finally the movie has come out. Then finally my family and I went to see it. I was setting myself up for disappointment. There was so much of the little stuff missing. All the stuff that would keep you interested and the stuff that was funny. The whole movie was so serious, but that isn't the way it was in the book. I wish I had never scene it, or if I could I would tell them to make it over and better. I thought the others were missing parts of the books, but this Harry Potter film is by far the worst. Someday I hope someone else makes these movies (and reads the books first) so that it tells the story better.",0
1895,8.0,"The movie is quite good, however, my favorite still remains to be POA in HP series.",1
1896,10.0,"I went to see the movie yesterday and it was a madhouse- all sold out! Luckily i got to see the movie. At first I was a bit disappointed at the fact that the movie was moving so fast and leaving out so much, but then the story really caught up. The graphics were really great but the information that was left out in my opinion made Voldemort look less evil. The movie is darker and scarier than the other movies and deals with a lot more stuff teens have to go through. All in all, the movie wasn't bad at all, I actually enjoyed it a lot except for the fact that so much was sheared off. Even though i liked the movie a lot i just hope the next movie is made into two movies instead of one because it would make a whole lot more sense and do justice to the book.",0

1898,10.0,"If you like Harry Potter, I really don't see why you wouldn't like this movie. It doesn't follow the book directly but then again, the path it does take stems from within the book itself. For example, how Harry manages to get through task two.",0
1899,8.0,"After the great achievement of The Prisoner of Azkaban, I had high hopes for the fourth book, my personal favorite in the series. However, after Alfonso Cuaron's wonderful directing and unique use of scene changes, I felt the fourth Harry Potter movie was just jumping from one thing to the next, without any kind of explanation or transition. I wonder how a person who hasn't read the book feels watching this movie. Would it even be that good? Or make sense? (There were a few times where I didn't quite understand what had happened, due to the choppiness of the movie!) ",1
1900,10.0,"Thsi was by far my favorite HArry Potter movie!! But they took out my favorite line! ""Twitchy little ferret are'nt you Malfoy"" Gosh thats the best! But it was really awesome. My friend thought they didn't go by the book and that the 3rd movie was better but at least this one didn't add unnecessary not true scenes. I was so excited and it was so worthwhile and definitely worth the wait! I would definitely advise you too see it AS FAST AS POSSIBLE because you can't risk missing this. My theater that I saw it in was almost full (about 3 seats empty). Well done!!!!!!!!! Ahhh, this stupid thing won't let me post unless I have 10 lines, OK I'm done now.",1
1901,10.0,"If you're a fan of the books you won't be as disappointed as many were by film 3. One aspect that annoyed me was the cutting of SPEW, however I can understand why it had to be done. I also felt that the acting of the 3 has improved miles- harry's crying scene in 4 beats the 1 in 3 hands down. As a Brit, i feel that the film benefited from having an English director. More than any of the others in the harry potter franchise, the school atmosphere was taken into account-especially in the Fred and George fight-""fight!fight!fight!"" scene. I'm still undecided on how i feel about voltmeter. I think Ralph Fiennes did an excellent job, but I wish they had included more interaction between harry and voltmeter.",1
1902,6.0,"To start off, It was a good movie so I would recommend you go see it. However, since I read the book before watching the movie, I was very disappointed with how much was left out. I enjoyed the first three movies, and books, greatly, but this movie contains basically the Triwizard cup, the Yule ball, and the end scene with Voldemort. Almost nothing to do with schooling is included. Ron and Hermione seem to have very small parts. I feel that too much work was put into the first task and the Horntail scene was far too long. The Dursley's are completely left out along with Winky. The Quidditch World Cup was far too short maybe lasting 5 minutes of the entire movie. I thought they did a good job with Rita Skeeter and Mad Eyed Moody. I won't ramble further but tell you to see the movie, but expect only skin and bones of the book, and I mean skin and bones.",0
1903,8.0,"Okay, let's face it- if they were true to the book, I would *still* be at the theatre watching the movie, 7 hours after it started.

Needless to say, I left the theater after the third one slightly disappointed and believed that I would have the same reaction to this film. Not so.",0
1906,7.0,"Harry Potter has finally come onto the silver screen for its fourth incarnation. From a strictly cinematic perspective, this was a fairly decent movie. I definitely has come a long way from Sorcerer's Stone in that this movie is much more adult. It has many scenes that could be considered too dark or scary for the typical under ten year old viewer. The cinematography is excellent though, with a brilliant combination of both set and cgi shots.",1

1908,8.0,"i've seen it in the first show here in cardiff on the 18 November at 00:05, and it was the best harry potter movie ever to me so far! It was hilarious and everybody in the cinema was enjoying themselves, laughing their heart out. I know it's hard to put every info in the book, but the director did a very good job. I think all of the actor and actress did a very good job except for emma watson or hermione. The special effect was really good especially in the first round of the triwizard tournament when harry was fighting the dragon. Although the second round was a OK, but the creature in the sea and also the treasure was clearly fake! i think she was trying too hard and it did not work naturally!If you are not a Harry potter fan i am sure that you will be after seeing this movie. i hope the same director will do the same job with order of phoenix n a couple of years! P/s Daniel Radcliffe you are perfect as harry potter! Please consider your decision about not participating in the order of phoenix!",1
1909,10.0,"By far the best Harry Potter out of the three released so far. A bit darker than the others, and in my opinion scarier, especially the depiction of Voldemort, but also more entertaining. The only part that disappointed me was the fact that they didn't show the Quidditch World Cup match. The quidditch matches are my favorite scenes in the other movies, so I was greatly anticipating this one, but it sort of just cuts off before the match begins. But I guess since they already spent about $140,000,000, supposedly, I can't really blame them. Overall the movie was fantastic though. The music was wonderful written and fit the different varieties of moods perfectly, and the graphics of the fictional beasts were phenomenal, especially the Hungarian Horn-Tailed. I also particularly LOVED the added humor in this one, especially with the Weasley twins. Most of the movie was very intense and left me sitting on the edge of my seat, shaking from the anticipation, even though I've already read the book twice. I laughed at Ron's twisting emotions towards Hermoinine and I cried at the horror of the death towards the end. This movie touches on every emotion and is sure to leave you pleased by the time you leave. HIGHLY recommend it.",1
1910,10.0,I attended a sneak preview for this movie and I must say it's the best Potter film so farm. The Potter cast has matured and finally learned how to act. Harry is a completely believable and sympathetic character. Hermione is charming and Ron is thoroughly enjoyable in his teenage awkwardness. Funny bits are right on the money. The twins were perfectly cast. ,1

They were not kidding when they told us ""Dark days lay ahead,"" for our hero Harry Potter.

The new Defense against the Dark Arts is Mad Eye Moody, played by Brendon Gleeson and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, gossip reporter for the Daily Prophet.",1
1912,7.0,"Why couldn't they have pulled a Peter Jackson, and released this as two movies? There's easily enough plot in Goblet for four or five hours of film, and Mike Newell's skill with a cutting knife was nowhere near as good as Alfonso Cuaron's in Azkaban. This movie suffered from the same flaws as Chris Columbus's treatments of the Potterverse, where getting as many elements of the novel on screen as possible was more important than letting them flow smoothly or giving the plot(s) time to unfold. As a result, we got to see many things for a few seconds each, without really getting to know them (Did Fleur have any depth in this movie? Did Krum have anywhere near enough? How could they not explain the ""Prior Incantatem"" magic, save mentioning the words?....). There were lots of good moments in Goblet, but they didn't add up to as much as I'd been anticipating.

Goblet of Fire has been the BEST adaptation of the Harry Potter series so far. Ralph Fiennes played a perfect Voldemort (and who better to cast than the Nazi, Amon Goeth, from Schindler's List?). all the new actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, and all the old faces, as well. it seemed in this film that many of the characters were given far more personality than in the past three, and the three main actors, dan radcliffe, rupert grint, and emma watson, have truly come into their own in this film. this time i cannot say ""oh, they could have played that scene SO much better,"" because this time around they really nailed it.

1916,9.0,"This is by far the best of the HP movies! It's action, drama, and comedy all in one film. The Goblet of Fire also has the best special effects of any of the films. The graveyard scene is wonderful! It's so intense and powerful. From the time Harry & Cedric travel through the portkey until Harry returns to Hogwarts I was on the edge of my seat. The director did a wonderful job of providing a great sense of something dark and dangerous to come. I can't wait for the next one! A bit different than the book, but then again all of the theatrical adaptations have been. But still in all an awesome flick! I can't wait to see it again and again!",1
1917,5.0,"I have read all of the Harry Potter books and have enjoyed every one of them. I'm not one to run out and watch a movie based on a book because I'm worried that they will ruin the book for me. When the first Harry Potter movie came out I couldn't help but go and see it. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies. Yes, they left some stuff out, but I felt they were minor details that didn't ruin the story. The third movie was good, but I had a hard time shifting from one director to the next. The third one was a lot darker but after a while it grew on me. I'm not sure why they changed directors, but I wish they would keep it consistent. I don't like change. As for Goblet of Fire, I knew beforehand that the director had changed once more and had also heard that the director wished to make this movie into two movies but ended up being able to squeeze it into one. Bad idea. He ruined the whole movie for me. They left out so much of what I thought was important. So many things were brought up and never finished. They brought Rita Skeeter into the movie and hardly showed anything about who she is and what she did. Why bring her in if you don't go anywhere with her character? I wish that Chris Columbus would direct the movies again. He did a better job. Thanks for ruining it for me Mike Newell. You should have made it two movies. For those of you who have never read a Harry Potter book, especially Goblet of Fire, you'll probably enjoy this movie just fine.",1
1918,7.0,"I am a bit disappointed in the continued casting of Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore. I the books Dumbledore is always cool as a cucumber, but, especially in this new movie, Gambon overdoes it. Dumbledore should speak quietly, and calmly, and hold people with his eyes, this guy, is a bit nuts. I thought the movie was very good otherwise, except the ending. It wasn't quite ""finished"" as it was in the book, and those details left out are the basis of the whole fifth story. Hopefully, the next ""new"" director will take note, and make amends for this pictures failings. This probably sounds like a bad review, but I would see the movie again, and the DVD will be added to my Harry Potter collection.",0
1919,8.0,"I just saw the movie this afternoon. I noticed Daniel really improved his acting compared to the previous Harry Potter movies. I agree that the movie is really so far the darkest of all the four, story is very good. Although, I would like to see some developments in the acting of Rupert Grint. I like Emma Watson's gown during the ball, she really grown up a teenager. Draco's dialogue is fading, not much scene. And at last, I heard my favorite expression from Rupert Grint, ""Bloody Hell"" whenever something unintentional event happened. I learned this from my colleagues in Luxury Cruise Line, mostly British/Scandinavian.",1
1920,10.0,"It was the best HP movie I've seen. The only bad things were how much they had to cut out to fit it into their desired time slot. It goes straight from the Riddle House to the Quidditch World Cup?! And then you don't even see the World Cup!! And what happened to S.P.E.W.? House elves? Rita Skeeter and her beetle Animagus? I mean.. I know they had to cut some out, but I hate when they cut out things that were actually in the book and replace them with stuff that they want in there to make it ""look better."" Other than that, it is an excellent movie. Too bad Cedric had to die. He was bloody hot. The graveyard scene is exactly how I pictured it when I read the book. It was amazing. And I also like this movie the best because it's so emotional. I cried when I went to see it.",1
1921,10.0,"This, to me, was by far the BEST Harry Potter movie yet. Although many ideas were indeed depleted from the direct sequencing of the book for times sake, Mike Newell did an outstanding job. All situations and circumstances in the movie were exactly as I had envisioned them while reading the book. He did an awesome job of turning the action-packed scenarios of the pages into jaw-dropping realities on the silver screen. This movie lost that sort of childish fakeness that each of the other movies had radiated with. Mr. Newell did an award winning job of actually aging the characters without making it too ""grown up."" Children everywhere are still more than OK to view this powerful Potter film. The amount of contagious emotion instilled into this film is absolutely breath-taking. I found myself crying when actors cried. I was angered when actors were. This is definitely a movie that I will go again and again to see. Job well done!!",1
1922,7.0,"First of all, my first reaction to the movie is that it rocks. The movie would be a disappointment for a book fan though but for those who haven't read the books, it is a great movie. It balances the light and dark situations. There are a lot of scenes that people can relate to such as asking out a crush. There are also a lot of funny scenes that would make you laugh for a long time. The graphics look great and the background was astounding. I left the movie theater satisfied.",0
1923,5.0,OK i have this movie and this movie was the worst one so far the acting was not great and the make up was horrible effects was way to American and i say that we should never get that director ever again i would choose Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton or Peter Jackson if it had to be American director i gave it a fair 5 not just because dan is hot it was a very well put out plot but it was just horrible from the bad making and not amazing acting from the actors Daniel Radcliffe did very bad and i'm sorry for all you people who do not know anything about movies i have said what i wanted to say so...,0
1924,5.0,"Having read the books (unlike many of the Reviewers with GOOD REVIEWS) I am sorely disappointed. Yes, it is impossible to completely put a long written book into a movie, as has been proved countless times in the past. But, like Tolkien and the upcoming CSLewis ""Narnia"" series, you had better at least stay true to the books. Not so here. A pretty movie, when you can follow it, but poorly adapted by Director Newell and Screenwriter Klove absolutely missed on most of movie, Hitting the mark mostly on some brilliant show with the ball (dance), and a nice underwater scene. Fair graveyard scene.",0
1925,9.0,"I went to the cinema with great expectations. I was so happy that finally the long waiting was over, I sat down in that big, cuddly cinema chair and was curious about to start it. After I had to bore 45 min of advertisement the movie started. The first impression was really good - the snake, which sidles through the graveyard, Harry's dream of the old man, who dies in the Riddel's house by the curse of Voldemort. But than Harry wakes up at the Weasleys burrow, one minute later he is at the Quidditch tournament and 3 minutes later it is already over. In one moment they celebrate the win of Ireland over Bulgaria, in the next Harry lies on the ground and watches at the dark mark (?? don't how it's named in English?? - dark mark sounds kind of funny). And soon he is on the train to Hogwarts. The beginning of the film seems a bit snatchy. Everything is only shortly named and shown. But with the beginning of the triwizard tournament, the movie gets started. The single tasks are really good display. The computer animations are good. The fight against the dragon is exciting, the mermaids are ugly and the maze had a touch of creepy. I waited for wicked and bad creatures, but this task was also a bit too much shortened. The middle of the movie is very very funny. Look out for Filch and Neville. The end is again really good displayed and all in all it's a short but nice adaptation of the book and the best Potter-Movie so far, especially because of the humor. ",1
1926,7.0,"A bit Packed, All the action crammed in to 1 part of the movie. And I didn't quiet understand if the Tri-wizards cup is over or not... Because there was no celebration of any kind. I understand someone died, so obviously an unhappy time, but still, I think there should have been something saying it is over. Also, why didn't Harry mention seeing Drakos' Father at the graveyard? Unfortunately I have never read the books so I'm not sure how much it varies, but a little daft in my mind. Some Good Action, loved the dragon scene, could of been a bit more brutal though (breathe fire while just behind harry on his broom).",1
1927,7.0,"First, I will say that I am indeed a fan of the books (almost to obsession) and of course, that will taint anyone's view of a movie. Stories written for books just don't translate to the screen in the same way, but that doesn't make the movie bad, just different.",0
1928,9.0,"The movie was not very much like the book. I am a Harry Potter fanatic, so I know all of the books pretty well, and this movie did not follow the fourth. The parts of the book that they kept (ex. that there were three tasks, parts of the Yule Ball, etc.) they stayed pretty true. However, they completely kept out Hagrid's giantess mother, the veelas, and the obstacles in the third task. I think that the movie was good, though, because it displayed the main points of the book, and could stand alone as a movie. It gave the viewer the general plot and was well done. I also liked how it hinted at some parts of the plot in books 5 and 6. Also- the graveyard scene was AMAZING. It truly couldn't have been done better.",1
1929,8.0,"I have to admit that the Graphics were awesome, but the Director once again made many important things gone. The Quidditch World Cup was only about two seconds longs with introducing the players, but they didn't show any playing. There was no Winky, and no Dobby, what happened to the House Elves? I must admit the first two tasks were done well, but the last one, the maze, was missing all the creatures. But it seemed to me that the movie went by too fast for anything to really happen, it seemed one minute after the first task, Harry was already in the prefects bathroom. In the prefects bathroom the mermaid was awake, and not asleep. It still has great music, and great effects, and the stuff that was in the movie was good, but they simply cut too much of the book out.",1
1930,7.0,"THis was the best HP movie yet. I'm not saying that it was great, but it out does the others. I agree with a lot of the other comments, that Dumboldore seems more crazy then a genius. But what can you do when the original actor dies? The movies are getting progressively darker as do the books. There have been a lot of negative comments made by parents that don't like that trend. It has been said before, but I will say it again. THESE ARE NOT KIDS BOOKS/MOVIES. If you have read the books you would know that and not throw such a fit when your kids get freaked out at the theaters. Leave them at home!! You and everyone else there will have a much better experience.",1
1931,8.0,"Enjoyed it, but slightly disappointed due to missing elements ",1
1932,10.0,"I swear, the movies just keep getting better and better. This was by far the best one yet and it is obvious that the acting of the three main characters has improved. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe's acting, which in POA i found to be laughable, amazed me. He drew me in with his emotion and i was so impressed. I did find the movie to be a little rushed and I'm sure if i had not read the book previously, i would be a little confused at some parts. Nonetheless, i enjoyed it thoroughly. The special effects were amazing, especially during the three tasks. The dragon scene was remarkably done. The overall theme has definitely changed and that appears obvious during the first scene of the movie. I personally prefer the darker, adult theme over the kiddy, ""eat slugs"" ones we've seen before. If you haven't seen this movie yet, for goodness sakes what HAVE you been doing? Pay the money, sit yourself down,and be ready to be totally blown away by yet another fantastic Harry Potter film.",1
1933,8.0,"Many people find a movie hard to like after they read a book about it, and in the goblet of fire, this is definitely the case. Many people are hating it simply because it left out so much of the story, and not looking at how hard it is to put every detail of a 733 page book in a 2 1/2 hour movie. they could've done 3 hours for a harry potter book such as this, and i definitely hope they do for the fifth movie, but i think that leaving most of the minor details out, many major details were shown in an excellent way for a movie, and it is a great improvement from the PoA. It was indeed missing an important part of the story, but hopefully it will be easily shown in the fifth movie. I definitely think this movie was a good one considering how bad it could have been.",1
1934,7.0,"While ""Goblet"" has some fantastic moments, to be certain, those moments feel compacted together where they shouldn't be. Anyone who has read the book will know what I mean when I say that the movie was a bare-bones coverage of the book's events. A lot of the characters we could as book readers grow to either love or hate are all but glossed over or given short details in which director Mike Newell seems to rely upon prior knowledge of them from reading J.K. Rowling's series for us to understand them. Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter (though well-portrayed by actress Miranda Richardson) is one such case of sad underusage, as are the other Triwizard competitors (Robert Pattinson's Cedric Diggory, Clémence Poésy's Fleur Delacour, and Stanislav Ianevski's nonetheless fantastically brooding Viktor Krum), while characters such as Bertha Jorkins, Ludo Bagman, and Winky the house-elf, pivotal to the events of the book, are entirely absent.",1
1935,6.0,"The direction was decent, they spent some dough on the special FX you can see as the FX are quite well done.Gets an 8",0
1936,5.0,"It was a good film, the effects were really well done. I still think Daniel Radcliffe's's acting can be poor, but overall the acting was great. ........... BUT this was only really a good film if you haven't read the books!!!! I was really disappointed. It was so untrue to the book. Right from the beginning it was wrong, Harry Potter always starts off at his aunt and uncles house!! Been a while since I read the book, but I remember this story also started off from their house. I know the book is long but there was a lot missing from the film. There were many scenes that were just so different to what I saw when I read 'The Goblet of Fire'. On a positive note, the final scenes were just as emotional as the book. I cried reading it, I cried watching it.",0
1937,5.0,"I just watched it this afternoon, and I was not impressed. Of course, it looks good and polished and everything, but there are flaws in the story and in the filming of it. I never read about films before seeing them, and I do this so that I don't go into the theater with expectations of what the film is supposed to be, except that I expect it to be well-made at the very least. This film suffers from technical problems which frankly should not be an issue in a film like this: it has a massive budget and an experienced team. Now by technical problems I means issues of continuity from one shot to the next (specifically, after Dumbledore greets the Beaux-Batons headmistress and then hops up for his speech) and computer graphics simply not looking right (when Harry returns after losing the Hungarian dragon and flies over the crowd, and Krum under the effects of the shark-head spell). These types of things bothered me a great deal. The story aspect of the film I can forgive because this is a massive story to condense into a film. In the end however, the movie feels incomplete, as if there are gaps that should have been filled but weren't. The movie is unable to stand by itself as a story: the viewer needs to have read the book to know completely what is happening. And n my opinion, this is a weakness. Overall, I found this film to be mediocre. I think it could have been better made by another director.",0
1938,10.0,"The best movie I've ever seen! It had some parts missing, but it had excellent animation, and everything that had to be there was. As the kids get older and more attractive, they also get better at acting. It had the best effects I had possibly ever seen, and it was great. They were all SO lifelike! There are so many themes in this movie that it can be great for anyone. The PG13 rating was a tad obsessive, but I don't know, I suppose it could scare a few kids. The ever popular bath scene was one that might worry a few parents too, but hey, he didn't look too bad either. You don't see anything, just his chest, so don't worry. So go see this movie. Right now. It will rock your socks off to no end.",1
1939,10.0,"I thought the movie was completely spectacular, I thought the feel of the movie really expressed the emotions the writer wanted us the viewers to feel. the contents I felt were not completely true to the people watching, because there were so many sense left out. there were I felt as a reader of the book and a viewer of the movie that there were some very important facts left out of the movie, we understand that there is a certain time alloted for movies, and that the movie might have been 4 hours long had we not shortened it, however I also feel that had I not read the book first I would not have understood certain aspects of the movie and would have been lost on certain events leading up to certain key parts, but, over all I really strongly feel the movie was all it could be and there for give it a 10/10. I really enjoyed the movie and thought it to be the best yet.",1
1940,,"This movie was horrible. I enjoy Harry Potter. I love the books, and the movies up to date. However, this one was not up to par. I understand that this book is rather long, and that the plot needed to be trimmed for the movie. However, it seemed a bit extreme. I thought that the movie lacked continuity. It seemed to skip around from scene to scene without trying to tie anything together. There was none of the little details. The idea seemed to be to hit you over the head with highlights and hope for the best. Furthermore, several times in the movie, it seemed that they just hoped you read the book, because they made no effort to explain crucial details. Overall, the movie was found wanting.",0
1941,9.0,"Ha. This guys review above me is funny (downright crazy bloke; i laughed when Diggory died). This was by far the darkest movie so far but, of the books, the best told story of the series (followed closely by half blood prince).",1
1942,,"As the opening soared, I developed goose bumps (as usual) and teared-up (again, as usual). From there on out, I actually noticed the ABSENCE of music! Sure there was some background instrumental but nothing that evokes the emotions of Williams' music. It was hardly a surprise to see that someone else was credited with most of the music. It is truly a disappointment. We usually purchase the soundtracks but are uninterested in this one. Then we read that John Williams is only doing themes for Order of the Phoenix. This is an even bigger blow. I understand that he is a busy man but you would think that he would give his continuing projects some kind of priority.",0
1943,9.0,"I've always been a fan of the Harry Potter books, but not so much the movies. I was disappointed by the last movie and how it left many key details out because that's what I judge movies based on. My pet peeve is when movies, which are based off books, leave gaping holes and leave key details out. I've been waiting for this movie to come out. I had heard different sides to it, from many different people. I saw it Saturday night, and I thought it was spectacular! There were parts left out, yes, but it was okay because they are able to get around it...it hasn't left gaping holes. All of the characters were fabulous, and were chosen very, very well. Even if you are not a Harry fan, I would suggest seeing it, because it is a great movie, one of the best I've seen, even if it is about ""Harry Potter"".",1
1944,6.0,"Well, this installment of the Harry Potter franchise was good enough, but to me it fell short of the mark. I felt that part of the blame would be the rather segmented script for the movie and the lack of punch the film should have had during the third task leading up to the final confrontation in the graveyard. The other part was the music, which to me was not as good as the other 3 movies, maybe the loss of John Williams was the reason.",0
1945,10.0,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire movie was fabulous. The CG was wonderful. I was wondering if they would be able to pull off the graveyard scene and talking through the floo network, but they did it wonderfully.",1
1946,6.0,"First off I would like to say that I did enjoy the movie, the action scenes were great and the triwizard contest was done well. Of the four movies to date it was the worst one i've seen though. I was watching this movie with my husband and was disappointed to note that it was missing far too much, my husband, who has never read the books, commented that the action scenes seemed to come out of nowhere, I agree. The movie needed more of the plot added, it needed to show Harry relationship with Moody, it needed to show the long hours Harry and Hermione spent studying all the hexes and curses. If I had never read the book i would have been at a loss as to what the plot was about and in truth I am dreading the fifth movie. So much happens in the fourth book with Harry and his friends that is a factor in the next book and I fear the next movie will end also in the tragic fate of the fourth. I fear that the omission of a large chunk of the plot(everything not pertaining to the triwizard) will confuse those who have never read the books.",0
1947,10.0,I find that the movie was the best by far of the Harry Potter series. The special effects are great and the acting is awesome. It has sadness and horror and of course happiness and it keeps you wanting to keep watching. It is great. This movie has the teen drama. it shows you teenagers growing up. I love how the special effects look so real. Harry potter and the Goblet of Fire i feel is a great movie for everyone to see. i believe that it could have been a little more easier to understand for those who have not read the book. You have to listen closely an pay attention. but in all Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is great. I love the adventure and the action. This movie make you sit at the edge of your seat even if you know what will happen because you read the book. I want the director and producers to know that they made a great movie and Rowling made a great book. The guys in this movie are very cute and the Weasley twins are getting hotter every year as well as Ron. Harry has always been cute. Hermonie is so pretty. I feel that people grow up so fast. I can not wait to see the movie again I want to buy it when it come out on DVD. I love how the water scene looks so cool and how again the special effects are out of this world. The movie draws you in. I give my thanks to the actors in this movie and i hope that their life is successful,1
1948,1.0,"I just shelled out my eight dollars or so to see this film. A friend wanted to see it and now I know why she wanted me to pay. I wish someone had payed me instead. I found this film simply boring. So much so that I almost fell asleep. It is too long and uses the Hollywood standard of using special effects to cover the fact that there is no story. It is about teenagers who do not look like teens and magic. I guess I can see why kids or kid-like adults would like this film. Sorry to be negative, but there just is not anything there. For Harry Potter fans this film may hit the mark; otherwise find something else. Even an old Hammer film is better.",0
1949,9.0,"I thought that this film was absolutely wonderful. No doubt it lives up to its predecssors. Don't be warded off by the ""worst potter film yet"" comments. Although at times the film might have seemed a bit rushed, it was still an excellent job of book to film adaption. I would not recommend bringing a young child, as there are a few scary parts, but other than that, I think all can enjoy this film. Harry Potter fans or not. The special effects were great and the acting was wonderful. I saw the midnight showing and it was totally worth it. If you have not yet seen this film get up and go because it was great. You may want to brush up on your potter knowledge before going, watch all the other movies. But most of all just enjoy yourself. The movie had very funny parts, very sad parts, and most of all kept me on the edge of my seat. It is by far the best potter, and a great move all together.",1
1950,3.0,"I was a bit surprised to see the number of comments proclaiming this movie to be the best in the series. I suppose there is a little bit of that after each one comes out. I felt that this was the most poorly directed and least enjoyable out of the 4 movies. The third one was by far the best imo. Perhaps the task of fitting the contents of the book into GOF proved to be too daunting, as it felt like much was missing. What was there from the book felt both distorted and lacking of any continuity. The sequence of events, while ordered, felt very broken throughout the movie. It feels like scenes are being rushed through, and then I am thrown into a new one, with little to no transition. While the acting was on par with the previous movies in the series, the portrayals were far off for some of the characters. I am specifically referring to Michael Gambon's depiction of Dumbledore, which was absolutely horrific. Dumbledore lacked the calm and kind demeanor displayed in the book. Rather this Dumbledore seems to border on angry, mean, and frantic. Madeye Moody and Lord Voldemort also suffered in this movie, displaying personalities vastly different from the book. Come to think of it, McGonagall and Snape were also very off. Snape didn't come off as a hateful teacher, just rather strict. McGonagall on the other hand lacked the sternness she has displayed in the books and previous movies. ",1
1951,10.0,"WOW! I saw it the night before it came out the day it came out and 3 times more! It was put together beautifully,I just love it.The exciting this is it comes out on DVD April 11 2006.Wow 3 months from now!I just love it~!I think they needed to add a few more things they left-out,like Pigwigen and S.P.E.W. (((Not spew Ron)) (((lol))) but hey there's always deleted Sean's!So look for it in April! I am writing so much cause it says 10 lines so I'm trying my best to fill-up this space.Oh I don't know if Tom Felton is playing Draco Malfoy anymore,cause if you lookup Harry Potter 5 you'll see his name is not on the cast list!What are they going to do??They start filming in February.Good luck!",1
1952,9.0,"I understand that there is only so much time before you lose a viewers interest in a movie, which is why I understand why they had to cut some story lines short. to be honest,I thought there were some scenes where the acting was good, but the actors didn't exactly portray the character very well. I believed one to be a little over dramatic. other than that, there are some great scenes where emotion is just pouring out of the screen, which is why i rank this movie so highly. the only problem was some people being out of character. One for example i found to be Dumbledore. there is a scene where Dumbledore strides across the room and practically tackles Harry. another example would be Lord Voldemort. i find Voldemort to be a cool-headed, evil and manipulative sleek man. and the actor for Voldemort in the first Harry Potter movie did a spectacular job of that. however in the Goblet of Fire he seemed to be having an overly expressing attitude that made it look like a Broadway production. but really aside from that there seems to be a good connection with the book.",0
1953,10.0,"I loved this movie because it was able to be humorous while still being true to the story. I loved having more of the Weasley twins as they are favorite characters of mine. The kids are growing up and so is the humor. I would recommend this for teenagers (around the same age as the characters). But, I think it would be a little too much for younger kids and I can only imagine future films will also contain PG-13 or stricter ratings.",1
1954,,"SPOILER WARNING: Although I don't really know why I put this here as most people have already read the book, and it's not as if the movie strayed that far away from the book. Nevertheless, it is the cordial thing to do, so if you don't want to be spoiled then stop reading now.",0
1955,9.0,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter novels and was somewhat disappointed with the Azkaban film since I felt a lot of the necessary content was cut. Although quite a bit of the story had to be cut for Goblet of Fire as well, I believe this script was better. The movie concentrated on the important aspects of the story such as the changing relationships and Harry's growth into a teenager. The special effects were absolutely wonderful and I think they make great casting choices. Daniel, Rupert and Emma are becoming quite good actors and I hope that they remain for the remaining films. Goblet of Fire is full of action and humor and is well worth the money. My only complaint is that it is somewhat hard to follow if you haven't read the books. My mother had a hard time keeping track of some of the new characters since they don't get a lot of screen time. The role of Barty Crouch was cut a little too much and you don't get much of a sense of who he is. Overall, it is an excellent movie and I think it is the best Harry Potter movie yet!!",1
1956,10.0,"I have read all the Harry Potter books and am 13 years old and this is an excellent movie! I am seriously in love with how close to the book this movie is with a few minor changes that were probably edited out due to the fact that this movie is already 2 or so hours long. This movie is definitely a more frightening one, and really grabs you into the movie. ( I cried during the death of a certain someone dear the end!) I'd say this is a MUST see for Harry Potter fans.. The director and writers really do a good job showing the more mature side of the 3 main characters and start to go into the love life of them more so than any other previous one. I really hope this helps!!",1
1957,3.0,"I found ""The Goblet of Fire"" to be very uneven. From the start of the movie until two hours in, nothing really happens in the way of plot development or story. Suddenly the story turns very dark, too dark for children in my opinion. The drama unfolding in the last half hour also exposes the weakness of most of the actors in this movie. Most are obviously under skilled to carry the script.",0
1958,1.0,"This movie is without a shadow of a doubt one of the biggest pieces of trash to come out in a long while. Daniel Radcliffe is a horrible excuse for an actor, and I give much more credit to his accomplices, as it must have been a challenge to work with what many consider to be the equivalent of a brick wall. The movie did provide some comic relief, which was just about every time Harry had to do some sort of strenuous acting, and the looks on his face were quite jestful indeed. The troop of students from the school ""Durmstrang"" looked like a reenactment of a corrupted Nazi Youth movement, with their yelling in a Germanic tongue and marching in very stiffly. Anyone that would seriously enjoy this movie has either a mental defect, or is under the age of 3.",0
1959,10.0,"great effects! can't wait for the 5th movie even though the book wasn't really good. the movie was great ! the first task was the coolest. but there where some stuff in the that didn't show in the movie. i think this was the best one yet. can't stop thinking about it. i want to watch it again.Ron Weasley was very funny. Harry was really cool in the first task, Hermione looked really good in the Yule ball. The last task was kinda spooky. voldemort looked really weird he doesn't have a nose. wormtail looked really stupid, he didn't even act like he hurt when he cut off his own arm. wel i guess i had better go now bye bye!!! can't wait any more.",0
1960,10.0,"Finally, the fourth Harry Potter movie has arrived. I have been wondering for months what is would be like, and...wow. I'm impressed!! The actors have improved dramatically, although I have always thought they were good. It is possible to see the differences between each of their characters. The ideas transmitted in this movie continue to be loyal to the book: Friendship, courage, loyalty, love. Although this movie is much more dramatic and thriller-like than the other three, it does not diverge from the main point: A wizard teenager growing up(with a few added problems, like the fact that Voldemort wants to kill him). I must congratulate Mike Newell on his direction of this movie. It's not too fast or too slow, it is exact. Mike Newell, J.K Rowling, the crew, and everyone who helped with this movie, have been able to demonstrate how Harry, Ron and Hermione are real teenagers, with feelings, thoughts, and, of course, jealousies(as is apparent with Ron). The tasks are amazingly shown. The viewer can almost feel the nervousness that Harry goes through throughout his fourth year at Hogwarts. The three main actors must be congratulated separately. Rupert Grint(Ron) is able to continue being comical and, at the same time, to act more serious, concerned, sorry or angry, as is necessary. Daniel Raddcliffe(Harry Potter) is able to act his part amazingly well. He is able to show his ""love"" towards Cho Chang in an obvious, but not overreacted way and, at the same time, he is able to act scared, nervous, happy, angry and/or sad during the entire movie. Emma Watson(Hermione) is, in my opinion, one of the best actresses in the film. She is able to transmit Hermione's thoughts, feelings, ideas, and, specially, her actions incredibly. It is easy to understand what she is saying and it looks as if she really does feel what she is saying. There is something about the look in her eyes during the different scenes and her body language that enhances clarity ti her character. She doesn't just recite the lines she has memorized. She FEELS them!! This is what I call a real actress. All of the actors in this movie are able to do this, but Emma Watson is exceptional. Congratulations J.K. Rowling. Mike Newell, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Daniel Raddcliffe and everyone else who contributed in any way to making this movie so incredible. Oh!!I almost forgot; little children might not want to watch this movie, as it is a bit scary and we don't want them having nightmares, so we?",1
1961,10.0,"I Love This Movie!~ all of the characters have fully developed, and i must say that they all look so dashing!it is a thrill to watch them grow up! and i hope to see them do the last 2 after their 5 movie contract is up! Ron got dashingly handsome in this last one, just look at his quaint Lil facial expressions! What a doll!!!!!! oh boy how i do love my Lil Ronny! and Emma, you have grown up i dare say. speaking from another woman, it is lovely to see how you have developed, and you are looking rather beautiful in the vogue issue as well. And finally harry, you are so cute. i know that Daniel in real life is probably not like his character that is why i write to Harry, you are so brave and have such a heroic aspect of life it is breath taking, i should very mush like to make your acquaintance some day! well cheerio!",1
1962,10.0,"I just thought that this movie was the greatest! Sure it didn't contain all what was included inside the book! But come on its a movie...Do you think that they would make a 4 to 5 hour movie? I highly doubt that will ever happen! So all you people who think it should be just like the book..Get lost? No offense but with a book as long as HP, I don't think they will ever make the movie as long as the book.And contain every little thing in the book. But all u people who haven't seen HP(Harry Potter) or even read it..You'll love the movie!So everyone i suggest you SEE IT! Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter yet.And its also one of the best movies out there! I think the movie crew did Awesome! I give it two thumbs up!WAY UP!",1
1963,10.0,"This is the best movie in the world!! OMG...I can't believe how much I loved it I'm going to see it for the second time tonight and this is only within on week!! I can't wait until it comes out on video so I can watch it 50 million times.I think that the special effects were really good!! It was so good I can't even explain. I also thought that the challenges were so good they looked so real. The movie should always be rated PG13 it makes it so much more interesting. The darkness and the small scariness that was really awesome and added so much more interest to the film. Thank all the actors, actresses, director, producer, JK Rowling, and all the other people who helped create this masterpiece. It is the best thing in the world.",1
1964,5.0,"I gave this Harry Potter a 5 out 10 points. All of the hype is centered on the special effects of this movie, but for those that have the read the series they will be sadly disappointed with the material left out. I found the movie very disjointed and difficult to watch, it tried to get to the ""good"" part too quickly thus leaving the viewer waiting for scenes that never materialized. I realize it must be difficult to put a 700+ page book into a 2.5 hour movie, but there must be some middle ground.",0
1965,8.0,"Okay, it took me two years to finally watch HP two and three, and even then I cried for lack of insight used by the directors....they've ruined my Harry Potter world. No Peeves, no Ludo Bagman, Hermione's hair is crimpy instead of bushy....her teeth are even normal.... no human could fill the shoes of those characters in my mind. ",0
1966,5.0,"You all probably know the story of Harry Potter GOF by now, so I won't waste your time giving you a summary of the movie. I would just like to address the areas in which this movie falls short.",0
1967,10.0,"this is by far the best harry Potter movie yet, i mean sure it had some scary parts but what i like is the yule ball scene, a lot of emotion, plus the goblet scene is also a very crucial point in the movie, i just think:its amazing how these 3,11 year old kids go from 14 year old mature adults i cant wait to see what Order of the Phoenix has to offer when it comes out in June of 2007.... oh and one more thing who does Hermione love more, harry or Ron? (just a question because I'm curious) so all in all the VERY BEST movie yet. ONE VERY LAST THING Mad Eye Moody was cool and i hope he will be in Ootp. the last last thing,",1

1969,9.0,WARNING: CONTAINS INFORMATION ON SELECTED SCENES OF HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE.,1
1970,10.0,"I've now seen this film twice, and I'm debating on whether to go see it again. (I just watched The Prisoner of Azkaban again; formerly my favorite, it now pales horribly in comparison.) The Goblet of Fire left out the not terribly important bits, left in the incredibly important bits, and only slightly tampered with story lines and scenes. You feel for Harry and the others in a way you haven't been given the opportunity to do in the past. The cinematography is incredible. The acting has improved considerably. The twins are hilarious, the lines come out naturally, and in the end, you really feel like you are watching the book. The only disappointing thing about this movie is that it is only 2 & 1/2 hours long.",1
1971,4.0,"Watch the degradation of the Harry Potter series into a reality type show -- there's entirely too much touchy-feely emphasis; the whole thread of the plot is disrupted. Add the heavy use of extreme close-ups -- Good Lord, I remember Mad Magazine making fun of that, way, way back!! After seeing another (4th?) closeup of Voldemort, I started wondering about the biologic sense of his face -- ""How can he exercise with those nostrils?"". (Okay, I was a biology major, plus I see all the the ""nose tape"" openers on the NFL players) So maybe Voldemort doesn't need air -- but the point was he was brought back to the biologically living!!",1
1972,4.0,"I should preface my review by telling you I have read and own all of the books, and have seen all the other movies in the theaters, and purchased the DVDs for my collection.",0
1973,10.0,"I am amazed how well a 750 page book has been condensed into 2 1/2 hours of film. The action and tension never wavered and as an adult I love the fact that the characters are growing up into interesting and in real life incredibly photogenic people. The three main actors improve every time I see a film and the most noticeable improvement to me is in the acting skills of Daniel Radcliffe, who displayed an emotional range that I have not seen before. I look forward to seeing him and the other main characters in future Potter and non-Potter films. I have seen this film more than once and it has already been added to one of my all time personal favorites. I must admit that I am a shameless ""Potter"" fan whose love of this story began with the books. For those of you who are upset with some details being omitted, get over it. Overall, the end result is an extremely well crafted and enjoyable film.",1
1974,7.0,"I saw it on the night it came out, I am the biggest harry potter fan and had to see it right away.As a movie it was okay, but in comparison to the book I was quite disappointed.Book 4 is one of my favorites and I felt the movie didn't live up to the book at all.I realize you have to leave out things in the movie, but they left out very important things.Also I didn't like their casting of victor krum, the one they cast was not what I imagined krum to look like at all.Also they changed dumbledores personality completely, they made him out to be a rambling, aggressive old man when in the book he is a calm, cheerful and powerful person.I think dumbledore was one of the biggest letdowns in the movie and what made me most disappointed in it.",0
1975,6.0,"I'm not going to blather on like so many other reviews seem to, I'll try to keep this short.",0
1976,3.0,"This was a horrible movie. Okay, I will understand if you have never read the books before you might find these to be wonderful, but as a big reader of the Harry Potter books, so many things were missing or wrong. First off, Dumbledore was the worst acting job i've ever seen. I understand the one who played him before died and you cant really control that, however, this Dumbledore couldn't have been farther from what he should be. He seemed frantic and not at all calm or wise like he should be. When Harry's name came out of the Goblet he seemed scary and not at all someone Harry could depend upon. Also, the maze was horrible, there was never any moving trees, instead things that they had to battle, like a sphinx or a Bogart. Barty Crouch was never in Harry's dream in the beginning nor did Hermione wake him up from it, she never knew about his dream. Then, when Sirius visited Harry by floo powder, i think it was a horrible representation of how that worked, it was supposed to be his whole head coming through, not just his face in a long. Obviously they can't include everything, but it was definitely the worst of the four. If you have never read the books, you must have been completely lost. The movie was like 20 second clips of like little things in the book, very little explanation to anything.",0
1977,8.0,"I really did like the movie in just a plain ""I'm just going out the the movies"" sort of way. I thought there were a lot of scenes that were extended and to make is seem more dramatic and because of that they had to leave out very important parts of the book. Some of the things I missed were the opening scene with the Dursley's; everyone sitting in the top box at the quidditch cup and seeing Winky and Draco in the same box; Ludo Bagman was also a large part of this book and he was also left out; I missed seeing the rest of the Weasley family (Bill and Charlie); there wasn't very much time spent with Hagrid or in any classes; the whole Crouch story line was messed up too; and that there weren't any of Hagrids monsters in the maze. So that is that for what they left out. As for character performances I thought overall they were pretty good. I thought Dumblebore seemed way to aggressive toward Harry. In the books Dumbledore is very calm, well spoken and so impressive but the way he was portrayed in the movie was loud, aggressive and somewhat scary (he is not suppose to be scary!!!) A couple last things that I did not like were Barty Crouch Jr.(what was with his tongue, it drove me nuts the way he kept sticking it out) and the way they should the use of floo powder. I think I was just too hyped up for the movie and I expected them to add much more from the book. I have went twice now and the first time it was with someone that had never read the books and they asked me questions through the whole thing and the second time was with someone who had read the book but a while ago and they were confused on some to the scenes of the movie too. Although I had to realize that they were never going to get all of the major aspects of the book in a movie that was 2 1/2 hrs long. Anyway like I said earlier, overall I liked this movie and I think it was much better then the the 3rd movie. I think it helped when they added the comical scenes (Flich and Fred and George were great!). I would definitely recommend it to others and I can't wait to buy it on video.",1
1978,10.0,"We all know that movies are not as good as the book, but this movie decided on first 30 minutes on the stuff in the book and the rest of the time it was hurtling you through the Tri-wizard tourney. I know the book is long, and it would be impractical to do all the stuff in the book, but come on, at least use some of the stuff. Also people who did not read the book might have had trouble with character recognition. One last thought, bath scene with harry and moaning Myrtle was kinda weird. This movie is more orientated towards the older kids and teenagers. The graveyard scene did, in fact freak my little cousin out. Also, the comedy scene at the ball with the Prof. Flitwick getting passed along above the crowd was out of taste with the flow of the movie.",0
1979,10.0,"i really enjoyed this movie. i have seen it 6 times and am obsessed. i loved it. when it comes out on DVD i must get it. i liked that it was a little bit darker because the trio is getting older and its nice to see their acting abilities expand. this movie also makes the series more interesting. it had humor, romance, and action. it kept you on the edge of your seat exspecially the last 30 minutes of the movie. i think all the actors and actresses did a really nice job. the music also flowed well with the movie. and after seeing the movie 6 times i am still not bored of it. its amazing because usually i would be bored of it by now. i would recommend this movie to anyone. it is amazing and i gave it 10 out of 10 stars.now since I've seen this one i cannot wait until the 5th movie to come out and see what they do with that one.",1
1980,10.0,"If you've come to see thriller,romance,action,and some drama you're in the right place.Don't wait till it goes out on DVD!This is the perfect movie to watch on the silver screen.It's loud,it's live,it's totally breathtaking.It by far beats it's predecessor POA.Cuaron shed all of the back story yet still managed to keep with the plot but it doesn't have Goblet's balance of laughing,crying, and scary moments even though Goblet's way darker.",1
1981,10.0,"My husband and I saw this movie over the weekend with our 3 kids, ages 2,3, and 6. We thought the younger two would sleep through it since we went to an 11pm show. Not true, they all loved it and watched the movie to the very end. I felt that it did the book justice. Everything I hoped they would put in was in. The only thing my oldest noticed was that the Harry Potter theme wasn't really in this movie. Hopefully, it will be in the next movies, for, even though the theme doesn't really affect the movie, I would agree with my daughter that it would be like watching Star Wars, or Superman, or ET without their themes; something is just missing. All in all, wonderful movie, worth seeing.",1
1982,10.0,"First, let me say this. If you're looking for the movie to ""be"" the book, pull your head out. It isn't gonna be. It never is, it can't. You can do stuff in movies that you can't in books, and vice versa. So for all you ""Harry Potter"" fans that are whining about it, grow up. It's a rendition of the movie. Someday you'll get your way and you can have them redone, but it'll be your budget and you'll get to figure out what to cut so you can keep your job. All in all, I'd say this was an excellent film. Incidentally, I've read all of the books too. Several times each, actually.",1
1983,8.0,In the aspect that many upon many families will be hitting the cinema's to see this i have to say that i have seen this and was surprised to find that this was best one out of all the harry potter series. Constantly interesting plot lines intertwining keep you watching throughout the film. ,1
1984,10.0,"I thought it was amazing i especially liked the part where Harry went under the lake to fetch Ron. I also liked the Yule Ball. I think Victor Krum is fit!!! The beginning was okay but they missed tons of it out because i never saw the Quidditch World Cup play anything, all it did was show Victor Crum!!! The end was very scary but i knew Harry wasn't going to die because there are other books as well to be made into films!!! Can't wait until the next ones come out!!! Voldemort doesn't look to happy to see Harry and i didn't like it when Cedrick Diggory died... It was quite upsetting to see his father find out hes . i don't like madeye moody either he scares me so much with his rolling eye.",1
1985,10.0,"i would just like to say that i have seen this movie and i reckon it is amazing. definitely the best one yet. Emma Watson looks gorgeous in it and all the acts are played well. i hope that the next film(order of the phoenix) will be even better than the the goblet of fire. there were several places in the film i enjoyed a lot. the main one being the end of the film when Voldemort makes his return, the part with the dragons at the first part of the Triwizard tournament and the part where Hermione entered the dance about half way through. she looked gorgeous. however seeings the last few of the films where intended for children around the age of 8 an up and then this one comes out on cinema as a 12A i was disappointed and a bet a lot of children where as well. overall i absolutely loved the film and i cant wait for it to come out on DVD. oh by the way if u haven't already seen the film go and see it asap.",1
1986,7.0,I did enjoy this film and it was most certainly the best of the four so far... But I have my qualms.,1
1987,,"I finished the book ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" for the first time a few days before seeing the movie and, frankly, I was extremely disappointed. I understand that somethings have to be omitted or altered to adapt a book to a movie. My complaint is that this movie handled things so poorly. I liked ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" because it was a story that didn't require reading the books and watching the movies that came before it to understand the story.",0
1988,10.0,"This movie was the best yet!! JKR just keeps getting better, I couldn't tear myself away. Already can't wait for number 6. The movie was as realistic and true to the book as i had imagined and expected it would be and JKR didn't disappoint. The only thing i wish for is that the movies go for as long as they need to include everything in the book on screen. I'm still waiting for the release of the 6th book and hope it's longer, and more packed full of new adventures and mysteries for a long reading. The visual effects imitates my imagination as i was reading compared to the movie, and it can't get any better than that. Anyway guys it's high time i leave you so you can go and see GoB numerously like i have. Fair well and happppy watching. Sarah oxoxox",1
1989,5.0,"Disappointing, that is the first word that come to my mind when I think of this movie...",0
1990,10.0,"I've seen the movie three times so far, it is by far the best movie yet!! I was a little disappointed that the dream scene occurred at The Burrow instead of on Privet Drive. I think the scenes with the Dursleys are very important for the set up of both the books and the movies, and I wish they had included those. I liked the way the scenes with Barty Crouch Jr. played out, I thought those were great. The scene with the Dealth Eaters were awesome, much better than they were in the book. The challenges for the Tri-Wizard contest were really good, and much more interesting than in the book! Dumbledore was a little scary at first, but he mellowed out in the end. All in all, I think this was by far the best movie!! They managed to include most of the important parts of the books, and that's good enough for me!",1
1991,7.0,"After watching Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire, I was somewhat disappointed. I expected there to be much more. The Quidditch World Cup wasn't even shown. One second, the game is starting, and the next second, it's already over. I found the movie to be fast-paced and somewhat of a disappointment due to how much was taken out of the movie. In some parts of the movie, a scene that took up 20 pages in the book only took 5 minutes in the movie. Before watching this film, I had thought that this would have been my most favorite Harry Potter film made yet. But sadly, I rather enjoy the previous film. Don't get me wrong though, it's very well put together and is a must-see film for all Harry Potter fans. I just expected more from it.",0
1992,9.0,"I hated the first 3 movies and am one of the harshest critics of the Harry Potter Movies yet I came to the see it expecting disappointment. Instead I adored it. Although they missed out the Veila, the Dursleys (the only book in which I can bear them), most of the Barty Senior/Junior History and the Quiddich Cup I loved it. The Dark Mark was more dark and scary than i imagined (which was probably a good idea since I imagined it bright green and purple) as was the Death Eaters attack (way more scary) and I thought the Death Eaters masks were great, although most of my peers didn't get it because they didn't know anything about the KKK (hope that's right). ",1
1993,10.0,"i thought this movie was an excellent display of, adventure, horror, comedy and romance packed in a wonderful harry potter movie. all the scripts were another great example of the magic world of Harry Potter it was enjoyable for me, my brothers and my parents. i was not a great fan of Harry Potter before i saw this movie but now i am and ill never stop loving Harry and his world. altogether i gave the movie a 10/10 because it really felt like i was there in the magic delightful adventures of Harry and his friends. well done Harry. the book told an eventful story that the movie took into action and created an excellent story of a young boy trapped in a magic world.",1
1994,10.0,"i saw the film yesterday and thought it was brilliant. i haven't read the books but have all the DVDs released so far and i know people say ""the films not as good as the books"" but i beg to differ. the way they portray everything, all the detail, imagery, effects, absolutely wonderful. the films are well worth watching!! i was shocked to see when Fred and George were not old enough to put their names in the goblet of fire, they look over 20!! the underwater scenes were magnificent.just think of all those young actors acting underwater, an enormous amount of effort must have gone into that. Andmaybe i'm being a little cynical, but i was disappointed when Ron swore, i wasn't expecting that!! great film though, can't wait to see it again!",1
1995,4.0,Where Prisoner of Azkaban left of Goblet of Fire went up in flames. I mean take a look at the movie. Plus points are the background score and the great CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) but story wise it falls flat.,0
1996,10.0,"I own the other 3 movies. And I will own this one. I have to say that this movie is by far the best one yet. The visual effects are stunning, and I found that the movie stayed more to the plot of the story in this movie, much more so than in the first three. One thing, however, is that we are beginning to be able to see the ages of the characters not matching up to the characters in the book. I am anxious to see how the director deals with this problem. It is unfortunate, but they did have to cut out a pretty hefty chunk of the story line, but nothing to really impair the movie. Some character development was left out, but again, nothing to hurt the movie as a whole. If you have not yet seen a Harry Potter movie, and want to see just one to see what they are like, see this one. It is absolutely amazing and I can't wait for the future movies (and last book in the series).",1
1997,10.0,"Mike Newell; being the first British film director, brought a distinctive British tolerance to the humor between students, and teachers, that the other directors failed to provide. The jump to leap approach for the film kept the laughs, anger, and ploy of Voldemort savvy for book fans and just, fans, while snappier pickup of the plot line put everyone on edge for a satisfactorialy horrifying battle, proving Goblet of Fire to be a true turning point in the actors careers and the films direction- For the book fans, it is understood that alterations to the order and detail of a story can be aggravating, but hey, they worked in nearly two and half hours!",0
1998,5.0,"I'm torn. As you read most of the comments from across the pond (i.e. Britannia)...it's an awful film, awful adaptation and nothing but one ""Bloody Hell"" of a mess.",0
1999,6.0,"Okay-Yes it was a wonderful movie, but after that book it needed to be a fabulous movie. They cut it down to much, and removed/changed plot that now forever has to remain that way in the movies. Therefore, here is what I think: The portrayal of Dumbledore was way off. In this movie he was shaken and disturbed. In the books that does not occur (in the readers mind) until sometime in the fifth book. In the forth book, Dumbledore is still a solid rock for Harry to depend on.",1
2000,6.0,"As much as I liked the film, i hated it. The first thing that got me was, NO QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP MATCH!!! Whats with that? The bits that they got right in the film, they really did well, the bits that they did bad, they did really awfully. They changed way to much of the storyline and events around, when they didn't really have to, obviously i'm a big fan of the book! But so much was missing, the house elves, the blast ended screwts, so much other stuff which i can't think of right this second. But stuff that could have easily been done right, was done wrong. I'm extremely disappointed, and yet, i did like the film. As weird as this may sound, it was the least faithful to the book, but definitely the best movie out of the four, hopefully they do the next one right!!!!!! So I give it 6 stars from a disappointed fan.",1
2001,7.0,"I'm sorry, but I think that Alfonso could have brought this book to life much better than the new director. It was still a good flick, but it was supposed to be GREAT! I mean they completely cut dobby and the female house elf that was introduced in the book causing the movie to take a different route to the end which is upsetting. But they did an awesome job recreating lord voldemort and the triwizard tournament...its just how they got there thats upsetting. Is there something so wrong about creating a movie that is three hours long, so that they can do a better job at covering the important parts in the books? I have heard arguments about the movies being targeted towards a younger demographic, but I have to ask, what is the age of the average demographic going to see it? I'd estimate and say 25. And I think that'd be young....OH one more complaint: the face in the smoldering embers is not what I, or anyone I know, Imagined when they were communicating thru fire. It looked ridiculous and made no sense...",0
2002,10.0,"This was a great movie. Not only was this a great Harry Potter film, but it was just a great one all around. I think if I knew nothing of Harry Potter I would still love it. It think it was the best so far. Most definitely. The others were good, but this one stayed the truest to the book. It wasn't as rushed either. The others seemed almost slapped together just trying to fit as much in as possible. This one flowed so beautifully and gracefully. Not to mention the fact that the trio are really growing as actors. I am especially impressed with Daniel Radcliffe. Ever since the movies began he as improved with each succeeding movie. Rupert Grint is no exception either. He has really seemed to discover Ron in this movie, what makes him tick and what makes him who he is. Emma Watson who began as my favorite has seemed to not improve as much as the others. She is still plagued with the misfortune of overacting. That is not to say, however, that I did not enjoy her performance. It was such a beautiful film and I cannot wait to see where Ralph Fiennes goes with his character of Voldemort. The scene in the graveyard was downright frightening and it will only become more so as the films progress. So, all in all, it was a fine piece of cinema that everyone must go see right away. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1
2003,9.0,"i loved the way it began i think it was well directed and afterwards it was very bang, bang ,bang and in your face it keeps you wanting to know what happens right until the end. There are bits in the movie that i found gory and thought it should have been a 12 not a 12a but the audience was young. it was a shame they missed out bits they could have had this movie ended up being shorter than the last two even though the book is thicker. i did enjoy it throughly even if you have never watched harry potter or read any of the books i think it is fun to watch this. Can't wait to see the deleted scenes on DVD! If you are squimish i do not suggest watching voldemorts return.",1
2004,9.0,"I have to admit i wasn't a huge harry potter when the first came out, but having just watched the fourth film one word, FANTASTIC have already watched the first two, cant wait for the next, definitely go see it at the cinema, the special effects will have you on the edge of the seat To say the film is two and a half hours long you don't feel it, the whole way through as glued to the screen A lot of the same cast obviously makes a difference its good to keep the same ones continuously ",1
2005,10.0,"OK, besides the fact that: 1. They didn't show the Veela at the World Cup. 2. The Death Eaters didn't torture the Muggle family. 3. Harry wasn't supposed to get knocked out. 4. No one fled to the woods when the Death Eaters attacked. 5. Beuxbaton was suppose to have girls and boys. 6. Fleur never talked like in the book. 7. They didn't show Hagrid talking to Madame Maxime in the rose garden, or Harry and Ron listening, or Fleur and Rodger getting it on in the bushes. 8. Hermione wasn't suppose to cry about Ron, but walk silently up to the girls' dorm. 9. Dobby was suppose to give Harry the Gilly Weed, not Neville. 10. They didn't show Winky, or any of the house elves, and they didn't mention S.P.E.W. 11. They didn't show any of the creature's in the maze.",0

If your into the magic and you love sometimes a little bit scary but a beautiful movie. The scenes are just so pretty and most of the time so colorful. If you haven't seen the movie yet you have to hit the movie theater and see it as soon as possible! If you've seen the other Harry Potter movies and now see this one, the characters have grown up so much. The music is so soft and then gets loud sometimes when magic occurs.

In the Prisoner of Azkaban you could tell that the series was starting to get a dark feeling. This continued into the Goblet Of Fire. When Harry's(Danial Radcliff) name comes out of the goblet of fire he is as surprised as everyone else. Jealousy and resentment follow when his friend Ron Weasly(Rupurt Grint) believes that he somehow figured out a way past the age line that Dumbledor had put around the goblet to stop those under 16 from entering. During the first task he takes on a dragon and tries to capture the Golden Egg. He does so with a very cool bit of flying. For the second task he must go down and save Ron from the Merpeople. And the third task was to get to the Tri-Wizard cup in the middle of a maze. When himself and a fellow tournament competitor reach the cup at the same time. They decide to take it together. When the cup turns out to be a port-key they are transferred to a village where they watch Lord Voldemort return. The other competitor is then killed and harry battles with Voldemort and manages to get away once more.",1
2009,10.0,This is clearly the best choice so everyone needs to pick it ti was the best everything this year! Dan Needs Best Actor Emma Best Actdess Mike Best Dictor It Should Get Best Everything And Scarst Movie Also!You Should vote For Harry Potter And THe Goblet Of FIre EVEn If You are Not Sure What to vote for it was so good i seen it at midnight in my town when it first show and its all i tho about and think about it was so good I've seen it 10 times and want to see it so many more time before it goes out of theaters because then its going to be like 3 Mount's before i see it again i don't know how i live with out it its so good it needs to win!,1
2010,4.0,"This movie is slightly worse than the Prisoner of Azkaban, which puts it in last place in my book. It suffers from all the problems they had in the third movie. Namely, they didn't bother telling the story. They just went from scene to scene, trying to get all the action elements in under the time allotted.",0
2011,9.0,"Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite books. When I first read them I was hooked. The movies however, are not as great.",1
2012,4.0,"I left my viewing of the Latest cinematic Adaption of J.K. Rowlings, Harry Potter series with mixed feelings, while the film overall was a vast improvement on Alfonso Cuaron's attempt it still lacked the magic the Rowling manages to weave in her books. As hard as it has been for me to accept the changes that have been made to the plot I understand that due to time restraints not everything can be included. What I'm not willing to accept is the horrible acting I was forced to sit through especially from Michael Gambon has the man even read the books? Rowling gives such a detailed description of Dumbledore's personality yet Gambon seems to struggle with the basics. Within the Books Dumbledore comes across as a caring man who even when angered is calm, in control and all knowing, yet Gambon's interpretation is far from the truth he comes across as a man who is easy to anger and generally reacts before he thinks usually with an unexpected and unnecessary outburst, for example was bashing Harry against the wall really necessary? It wasn't in the novel. I all I can say is I hope some where along the line direction is as much to blame as interpretation. As for the cast as a whole I believe only Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith can hold their heads high everybody else tried too hard.",0
2013,3.0,"I have read all of the books of Harry Potter, but this is the first movie I have seen. Quite frankly, it was a major let down.",0
2014,10.0,"Since the Potter movies came to the theater, I've been watching them, and collecting the DVD's, and reading the books the second they were available for sale. While I enjoyed the different directing style of the third director, I felt some of the magic was missing from that movie that was evident in the first 2 movies. Cauron seemed to be going for a more realistic look at the grounds and castle, but that seemed to take away from the mystique of the magical aspect of the movies. However, the 4th installment was a wonderful combination of both realism and magic, which was really quite breathtaking at times. The emotional element of this movie was real, and the character of Harry was really humanized more than ever before. I would watch it 1000 times in the theater if I could, and when it comes out on DVD, I will be first in line to take it home. A must see for any Potter fan, this one is the jewel in the crown so far. I wish Mike Newell could direct them all, he would give Spielberg a run for his money.",1
2015,4.0,"The first two ""Harry Potter"" movies were disappointing, but were still good enough to re-watch. After seeing ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", I thought that the movies were finally shaping up, and that they would, like the third volume, take on the mood displayed in the books. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was truly a masterpiece, the fourth installment in the popular series was horrible. The movie was cut in the most awkward places, and the director neglected some important details. Some of the characters were pathetic, as was the movie itself. This director changed the wise and calm character known as Albus Dumbledore into a crazy, temperamental old man. In the books, Dumbledore is one of my favorite characters, and is wise, calm, thoughtful, and humorous. In this movie, he is constantly shouting and he gives off a feeling of anger and frustration, something which J.K. Rowling's character never does. The newly-introduces Alastor Moody hardly fits Rowlings's description and to top things off, they made him look even more pathetic thanks to the ridiculous eye patch-like device conceived to hold his magical eye. His appearance alone was nearly enough to make me want to leave...and that was before I saw the rest of the movie! The director tried to add in some humor. Unfortunately, added in way too much, and the end result had me rolling my eyes and wanting the movie to go on. The bath scene with Moaning Myrtle was simply ridiculous too. What a waste of precious screen time. Oh, and what about the time Harry found Crouch's dead body, ran to Dumbledore, but never mentioned it? The only part of the movie that was done decently was the scene with Voldemort. That was truly a success. The rest wasn't even worth seeing.",0
2016,10.0,"well this movie is much better than the second and the third, the actors are much better and the emotional part of the acting is much better and not so shallow. and the set and the customs are much better i tried to laugh when the director added to add more humor, but it was fine. the CG Effacts were great! and i loved seeing the dragon rushing after harry (almost killing him :D). amazing sound..as always! i heard about Daniel wants to leave his role in the movies.. but i don't really care..",1
2017,10.0,"I went into Gof expecting a treat and what i saw was a whole lot more. Wow, this movie was brilliant. The gangly 11 year olds we saw in the first movie have grown up, Daniel Radcliffe is blooming into a bloody good-looking boy. Emma is gorgeous too, while Ron maintains that same cheeky humor and I found some of the most funny scenes were the ones mainly focusing on Ron.",1
2018,,"I am very disappointed with the way that they butchered the plot of the fourth Harry Potter book when it was made into a film. They skipped many important parts, and the parts they did include were short and not satisfying to myself (ie. Quidditch World Cup). I was disappointed in the lack of linear-acy. It was hard to follow what was going on, as large periods of time were skipped over. I knew only because I had read the book. And why is Ludo Bagman not in the movie? And where are Dobby and Winky? Sirius was supposed to be in Hogsmede, and they were supposed to go see him and bring him chicken. He was also supposed to be in the hospital wing with Harry at the end, and Snape is supposed to finally know its him. The third task was also butchered, as there were no magical creatures inside. The disagreement of Fudge and Dumbledore was entirely skipped over at the end. The champions should have had more to do with the movie.",0
2019,3.0,"OK i understand that they have to cut bits out, but to leave so many needed characters out of the film is not good. what happened to dobby, winky and mr bagman argh! my brain hurts from stressing so much over it. yes it was a good film if you haven't read the book it does not do the book justice. what about the end when harry is suppose to be attacked by a giant spider and thats why hey can't run away from voldmort Dur. and dobby gives harry the gillyweed. oh dear so many mess ups i just hope they can at least keep the ending of the next film to the correct ending I'm so disappointed they were doing so well until this one. i would of stayed for an extra 3 hours to watch it if i had but as long as it was excellent.",0
2020,4.0,"I loved the other Harry Potter movies, I really did but this one just left me disappointed. I went in with high hopes but they fizzled pretty soon due to the lack of character development, plot development and Dumbledore's atrocious accent (swinging from British to Texan all in the same sentence!!!)",0
2021,10.0,"Well, for starters the CG was astonishing. The dragon scene was amazing. One of my most favorites was the dance for the Yule Ball. I remember it scarcely but I recall step forward, step back, step right, step left, lift your partner in the air. When Harry goes underwater and listens to the Golden Egg, the words were not right. It was supposed to be ""Come seek us where our voices sound,We cannot sing above the ground, And while you're searching ponder this: We've taken what you'll sorely miss,An hour long you'll have to look, And recover what we took,But past an hour -- the prospect's black, Too late, it's gone, it won't come back."" That's the whole entire song. I guess they cut that off for time purposes. Well, the next movie better be better.",1
2022,5.0,Almost immediately after I heard that the Harry Potter books will be filmed I knew it will be a hard job for anyone. ,1
2023,8.0,"I had great hopes for this film, and re-read my book to make sure I knew what was going on. I wish I hadn't. There are huge chunks missing and no mention of house elves (who can miss out Dobby and Winky?!, the real finder of gillyweed, and the origins of Madame Maxime. To forget all about the goings on at the Quidditch World cup, Veelas, the farmer who had the world cup on his land (and needed his memory erasing)....etc. having said that, the film was well made, and the scenes during the Triwizard tournament were well made - the graphics are amazing. Go to see it, but forget to read your book first. Hopefully SPEW will be mentioned in the next film.",1
2024,5.0,"While I realize the impossibility of including the entire book, the ending of the movie left much to be desired. It seemed as if once Harry took the port-key back to Hogwarts it went completely downhill. Much detail from the book was not explained or eliminated. Unless one had read the book, some of the movie's ending was unclear and confusing. Not showing the ministry's elimination of Barty Crouch, Jr., their subsequent denial that Voldemort had returned, and the enmity developing between the Minister of Magic and Dumbledore leaves a great deal to the viewer's imagination. Not showing Dumbledore's steps taken to reinstate the Order means that the next movie will have a lot of explaining to do before it can initiate the plot for that book. The groundwork for The Order of the Phoenix was not formulated and begs the question as to whether the movie will be a complete hatchet job of the book. The previous movies did a much better job of converting the books to the silver screen.",0
2025,8.0,"This was an awesome movie. You can definitely tell the difference in the different directors, but I loved this one. Sadly it did leave out some things from the book, but from what they took from the book, they did fabulous! I am sure that all girls think this seeing that am a girl myself, my favorite scene was when Harry Potter was in the Prefects' bathroom trying to find out the clue to the 2nd task. He looked so good in that scene!!! I have seen this movie 3 times in a row and I loved it more and more each time. It was also a bit creepy too, especially Voldemort played by Ralph Fines, he was great and scary too. I loved it anyway!",1
2026,2.0,"The latest installment of the Harry Potter story is, by far, the worst to date. After sitting through a butt-numbing movie, my only comment was 'what the hell ?' It barely stayed true to the book and cut out so much from the original storyline that it was barely recognisable as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I would have rather paid more and seen the entire book in 2 or three movies then the shameful excuse that they put up on our screens. Most of the movie, my friend and i were whispering to each other, trying to figure out which part of the story we were watching. all in all, the worst Harry Potter to date, and i seriously hope that the directors/studio or whoever decides to make Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince into several movies and not one terrible piece of motion pictionary.This movie only escapes getting a one because of the excellent graphics and the time that the people in computers must have spent touching up the pubescent actors skin.",0
2027,7.0,"The latest installment in the Harry Potter series was disappointing. While I realize that they can't possibly include everything that was in the books, I do think that they left out some details that make the characters who they are. If you haven't read the books, I can't see why you would care what the characters were doing -- the details that they left out were the ones that make the people well rounded, and explain their motivations. Hermione is just pettish and spoiled if you don't know that she is smart and frustrated by the boys' ""laziness"" and Ron seems off balance if you don't know that he has a crush on Hermione and is jealous of Krum. And why did they leave Dobby out of the Quidditch scene and the 2nd challenge? He was already introduced as a character... Just stuff like that was disappointing to me.",0
2028,,"I'm hoping one of you can help explain a few things. I have read the books but still...I'm a little confused. If this has already been discussed, I apologize for annoying you.",0
2029,10.0,"Oh My God!!! Best Harry Potter movie of the four by far!!! Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire definitely deserves a ten out of ten ranking (or at least 9...i mean like come one!). I hope they keep this director for the next movie because he is really, really good and made the movies just so much more realer and he kept all the right parts of the book. I'm sure everyone agree's with me. It's got a lot more funny bits. Fred and George are hilarious. The characters have all grown up a lot since the last movie. Hermione's shown that she who just interested in books anymore, and Harry who fancy's someone. The actors are a lot more good looking to (especially Rupert Grint - isn't he just gorgeous!). I can't wait till the next movie which i know will be even better (though i doubt that's possible seeing The Goblet of Fire was excellent!).",1
2030,10.0,"I loved this movie. I loved every aspect about it. Emma Watson was beautiful as well as everyone else. It was particularly more interesting because the director seemed to add a little more humor and romance in to the movie, which is great. One thing that kept bothering me during the movie was the characterization of Albus Dumbledore. I'm sorry for the old man, but Dumbledore was just way off from the portrayal of him from the book. I've always imagined Dumbledore to be calm, intelligent, and even, majestic. However, the Dumbledore I saw in the movie was irritating, confused, and short-tempered. I wonder why the director is continuing to use this Dumbledore (I don't know the actor), while there must be at least SOMEONE who can do a better job them him. However, other characters were great, and I especially liked the little romance going on between Hermione and Ron (or Harry?). Anyways, I really enjoyed the movie, and I just hope that the director can do something about Dumbledore in the next one.",1
2031,7.0,"This would have been a fantastic film for me had I not read the book first and had not see Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter 1 & 2. Michael Gambon is a fabulous actor but plays Dumbledore overly dramatically. In the books Albus Dumbledore is portrayed as a calm but strong willed person showing no sign of panic at any time, but in Harry Potter 4 he seemed to lose it on more than one occasion. Many wonderful vital parts of the book where missing(Including a character or two)such as the explanation as to how Barty Crouch Junior escaped from Azkaban and what happened to him after he was exposed as the fake Madeye Moody. I realize the book was a hell of a size to fit into a movie but I'd have sat through hours more film to get the full story. We also saw no disbelief or worry on Lord Voldemort's face when he and Harry duelled in the graveyard as the wands clashed. I'd hoped that that scene would have been in full. The special effects make the movie what it is; a blockbuster of a film but I'd recommend reading the book to fill in the blanks.",1
2032,,"Really enjoyed the action and the special effects. It's a bit scary, tense at times which makes it great for adults to watch. It's a long movie. It's very good visually when Voldemolt comes back, his face is done well. I like the part about Harry and the big lake when he turned into a frog. and jumped up out of the water to finish part of the wizard tournament. Although it is long it is very engrossing and goes really quickly, the story just grabs you. The twists are good, there are events that happen that are unforeseen and for those of you who have read the book, it's quite different from the way the book is written. John Williams is very good with the music, but I don't think the fourth soundtrack is as good as the others. The first movie soundtrack is really good, and so the fifth.",1
2033,9.0,"The most interesting one in the series, combining the youth, the competition, the courage, the magic, the blood, the friendship, the love, the devil and the death together.",1
2034,5.0,"I guess you could say that it did fairly better than the last three movies made, especially the Prisoner of Azkaban (that movie was seriously disaster). I mean, the action was great and all, but the movie skipped out on some really important parts. If I had watched it without reading the books first, maybe I would thought that it was awesome, but I did and I pretty disappointed. The movie was great with the visualizations of the book. It just made everything a bit clearer in my head about how the scenes would like. The underwater part was especially spectacular. The acting was pretty mediocre, I mean seriously! Couldn't they have made the scene where Voldemort yells Avada Kedavra at Cedric and he dies, a bit more dramatic? The moment the spell hit him, he just fell. He could have at least said something, like yell at least before the spell. But he didn't. They totally skipped out the part about Harry giving Fred and George the thousand Galleons! I don't even think they even mentioned the thousand Galleons. Sure, I know the book was more than 700 pages and of course, the director couldn't possibly fit all that in a 2 and a half hour movie but the joke shop and the inferences about the money continues throughout the 6th book. If you just introduced that in the next movie, people are sure gonna like ""Huh?"". Another thing, the Quidditch World Cup lasted like about 15 minutes of the film! That was a whole entire chapter of Harry Potter. Where was Winky in all of this?! She played a pretty big part in it and yet they deleted her from the whole entire movie! What is up with that? This was what really threw me off. And Malfoy, they only gave him almost 2 scenes and that was it! Also with Cho Chang! She is supposed Harry's love interest and plays a major major part in the books. But they only gave her 3 lines and that was it. Can you believe it? Three lines. Three measly lines. That was just wrong justice. Overall, wasn't as good.",0
2035,8.0,I read the first book when I was 11 and have since then been what you might call a Harry Potter fanatic. I loved the true human nature present in the stories and the scope the 'magic' gave the imagination. I made the stories my own.,1
2036,5.0,"How very sad to have lost our dear Dumbledore. It was sad enough to have lost Richard Harris, but now I fear Michael Gambon has lost the spirit of Dumbledore, when one was hoping he would make the role his--a difficult and ambitious task, indeed. Does the fault lie with Gambon or with the director of the film. Regardless, let us hope they salvage the true nature of Dumbledore in future installments. Throughout the books, Dumbledore remains unflappable, a constant, always calm and rational; these qualities also make him safe, and even almost ""god-like."" What happened in the fourth movie? Dumbledore physically grabs and shakes Harry just after his name is spit out of the goblet of fire. This is not the Dumbledore of the novels. One hopes the true character will emerge for the fifth movie.",0
2037,6.0,"OK...now i would like to say congrats to the actors because they done a wonderful job...except for the new Dumbledor...He ain't even close to Richard Harris...This movie would be least liking out the of them all so far...because they had rushed too many things such has...they had not introduced Winky, they only showed the Qudditch cup champs come in...and only showed Harry Potters dragon instead of watching the other players dragons. Plus...What happened to all of Hagrids monsters in the maze...what monsters? oh yeah...they're weren't. Come on Director... This movie mostly based on the love affairs between them...and that is not the important part in this series! This movie gave sum of its main ideas, but either they were too different, too short, or made them look too lame the movie was pretty cool in some ways... I give this movie an average but fun 6 out of 10!",0

At the beginning of the movie quite a bit was cut out so the movie wouldn't go on for hours, but that didn't change the fact that is was a cool movie! Some scenes were added that didn't happen in the book though. I thought the Triwizard tournament absolutely ruled and the Yule Ball was wicked! I loved Hermione's dress! It was a great movie but Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favourite! The movie went for a good length of time so no one could possibly get bored! Even though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are a few years older than they are in the movies they play the parts oh so magnificently. I don't think the director of the first movie, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone could have chosen better actors and actresses to star in these movies! Well done!",1

I go into my local theater, expecting to watch this great movie, (thats just because it was way over hyped, and I mean way over hyped) and I have to sit through 2 and a half hours of this choppy, confusing story that will make absolutely no sense to anyone but fans of the book.",0

However, there were also sad moments, when my eyes started to tear a little bit. This was the darkest movie yet, especially since Harry faces the most darkest dangers yet. Anyway, it was an excellent movie, you won't regret seeing it, no matter what your age! Currently, there are a few major movies out, such as King Kong and the Chronicles of Narnia. I saw King Kong, it was also very well done. (An amazing movie!) I am about to start reading the Chronicles of Narnia, so I figure I should read the books before I see the movie. I have heard that it is very good though. Though, if these movies came out at a different time, I'm sure Goblet of Fire would be higher up on the popularity list. Excellent movie though, really! :D -- Cassie*",1

It is my hope that they consider this for the future HP films in order to capture more of Ms. J.K. Rowlings brilliant literary talent! Once again the Cast and Crew of the film did a brilliant job!

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire follows the plot line of the book much better than the other three movies, meaning the scenes weren't just slapped together. Even though the Dumbledore was portrayed rather poorly, the rest of the actors did wonderful jobs by keeping the personalities of the characters within reason.

2048,8.0,"Out of the first two Harry Potter movies, I'd say the third and fourth would have to be the most scariest yet. When I first went to see this movie I couldn't hardly believe it! Most of best scenes from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book were left out. The thought that they tried to rush it all out in the very beginning and some characters didn't quite receive a lot of time for their scene is simply dreadful. At first, I thought there's a lot of people lined up and usually that means a good thing. Then I thought maybe its just because it was the first weekend the movie was let out it won't be so bad after all. But, my high hopes shattered as soon as I went to see the movie and saw that not even Cedric's death scene was good enough. I may not be a Cedric fan but I believe he should've received a bit more time.",1

It takes you right there with them you feel like your in the movie too. i think that this is Daniel Radcliffe and the rest of the crew's best film it is also showing them growing up and fighting like friends do and it is great how they make up because that is how friends do it.

It was so awesome! Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupirt Grint are all great in this. Even though they are much older than 14, they pull it off well. The tension between Hermione and Ron is great as well as the tension between Harry and Ron. Also for the DVD I hope they start doing commentaries.

2053,8.0,"I actually saw the movie the weekend it was released. There were a few disappointments, but overall, the movie was excellent. I loved the special effects and the movie really followed the book. But, like I said, there were a few parts of the movie (or lack of parts) that I didn't like. I would have loved to see the first few chapters of the book followed directly. There is nothing I would have loved more than to see the ton-tongue taffy incident with Dudley. I was, actually looking forward to that part, but it wasn't even there. I really loved Dobby from The Chamber of Secrets, and I wish they would have included him in the movie, but the way they explained the gillyweed was pretty good. I also wish they would have followed the storyline with Serius more. He really didn't have a major part in the book, but he is still a major part of Harry's life. He is very important to him and he was barely mentioned. Some of the other parts that I didn't like were some of the changes. You can tell this was a different director because the Gryffindor common room, the Great Hall and the library were all smaller. Well that is enough the movie. Although there were a few parts missing, it was still an excellent movie. My kids really enjoyed it, and so did I. Last thought: Wow is Hermione getting to be a real cutie. She will be a knockout when she gets older",1
2054,4.0,"I was amazed, seeing the film. Result: It was horrible. I know the book and in my opinion the filmers failed to bring it on the screen. That sounds hard, but they looked only for (very good) special effects and not on the story. Please: Next time read the book and then making a film. Of course it was difficcult to reduce the story to filmlength, but a lot of little things, you can easily read in the book, were ignored or turned into something else. For people haven't read the book it isn't better. The film is hurrying up to get all in and you have no chance to check what's the story. Sorry that wasn't a good work. I hope the filmers will do better with the next book. Of course it's more difficult, because this book has more story than the goblet. Please read it first!!!",0
2055,9.0,This review will be divided into two parts: the first part is a review of the movie as a standalone film (not based on a book) and the second part will refer to the book. So here we go:,0
2056,7.0,"I think it was a good movie, but A LOT was left out. I think some of the most important parts were left out and changed. They didn't even have extras. I think they need to put the Dursleys back in. I don't mean to complain, but it just wasn't what I expected. Hopefully they'll stick with the same director for more than one movie like the first two. It makes it so weird to have different directors. I don't know... I mean, again, it was a good movie, but it just lacked some material. I know they are limmited to what they can do on the set, but still, they could have put a few more things in there. I think I'll stop now before I make anyone angry...I don't mean to offend anyone if I do so. If anyone agrees or disagrees, message me. I'd love to know how anyone else feels about it.",1
2057,6.0,"I was a bit disappointed by the fourth installment of the Harry Potter series. As an avid reader of the books, there were quite a few things missing from the movie, and they got under my skin.",0
2058,7.0,I'm a big fan of all the Harry Potter books so far and I thought the first book to the third book were all successes as films and the new director has definitely captured a darker side of the book and i think it has improved the book. However I was slightly disappointed with his film. I loved all the special effects and the Triqwizard tournaments but I think they missed far too many scenes. For example I was really looking forward to seeing the sphinx who riddled Harry but instead Harry and Cedric simply ran through and grabbed the cup. I'm really disappointed with the new Dumbledore as he lacks the wise and respectful approach that the old Dumbledore had (excuse me i cant remember actors names)I didn't think Malfoy was shown enough or Snape and the idea of quidditch seems to have slowly gone out of the window. I'm especially looking forward to the 5th and 6th films. I've given it a 7 because it still has that magical Harry Potter feel to it :),0
2059,10.0,"I watched the movie with much anticipation and no expectations. The movies can never be exactly like the books and to see one with the expectations of being just like the books won't do. This movie was extremely well done. You're never bored throughout the whole movie. Graphics are fantastic and very realistic. Ending scenes were very dramatic and very close to how they happened in the book. There's always something happening. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more, just as it should. Costumes were fantastic and the actors were brilliant, as always. Can't wait for OOTP to be released,hope it is as well made as this movie was.",1
2060,3.0,"As a Harry Potter fan and reader, I was very,very disappointed this was far most the worst movie of the films(so far) and I want to bring it to your attention.",0
2061,9.0,"First of all, most of the people here say that they got Dumbledore wrong. I believe quite differently. In the 4th, 5th , and 6th books, J.K. Rowling begins to peel away the facade or veneer that Dumbledore was seen as. Dumbledore is strong and a true leader, but he has human faults. He is not fearless, like Harry thought, which just makes Harry think'What now? Who do I count on?'""Goblet"" shows Dumbledore as a frail old man. Sure, he seemed fearless in the first three. For those of you who have read the 5th book know about the prophecy. Now, if Dumbledore knew that, which he does, if Harry died in the tournament, that meant Voldemort would grow the strongest ever. In your declining years, wouldn't you be afraid? The point is that Dumbledore is not God. He is not immortal. He fears death and evil. HE IS A HUMAN BEING! In ""Goblet"" you see him as one. So if you think they got him wrong, your just stupid. I mean, how would you react? I think Dumbledore handled the situation well, which makes Harry admire him more, even through his fear.",1
2062,,"It goes without saying that the movie's details will be minimal compared to the book, unless the movie were to be 6 hours long. But why the screenwriter, and especially the director chose to eliminate so much of Rita Skeeter, Sirius Black and the whole of the Privet Drive sequences in favour of calculated and unsuccessful pseudo-ominous close-ups meant to instill fear (they did NOT), a huge dragon-flying sequence in the Triward tournament, and way too much footage of the dance (BORING) is a question I beg to ask them. And what is with Dumbledore?!?!! First, he looked totally manic and not at all in character. A man of his power and intelligence would not be running around in a tail-spin like a frantic house-frau in a very ill-fitting blue dress! What were they thinking?! I hope for much, much better in Order of the Phoenix.",0
2063,6.0,The movie is awkward.. Harry is definitely not a child anymore...,1
2064,5.0,According to the book's Dumbledore is a calm wizard and don't get upset so easily. In this movie he get upset so easy (when harry's name pops up from the goblet of fire for example) and it feels like the actors or Dumbledore has lost his touch. Other thins that is bad is that Sirius Black is only in the scene with the fire. I miss him at the end in the recovery-hall when he and snape really show their hate to each other.,0
2065,10.0,"This movie is my all time favorite out of the Harry Potter movies! I cannot wait till its comes out in stores! Me and my friends talked about it for days! I think some of the characters (like Harry and Cedric)are very good looking! The theme is really good. The only part that I may have had a problem with is that it doesn't follow the book, because I had just got done reading the book and the movie was somewhat of a shock. But I loved it! I liked the movie so much that I went to see it in the theaters twice! I recommend this Movie for Harry Potter fans and for people that love thrilling, funny, and exiting movies! Please take my work for it!",1
2066,5.0,"I have seen all the Potter movies,but in my opinion the story isn't continuing but repeating itself, of course it is a great cash cow but the hype that is created is better for the business then for the film fan. Probably it is good enough for kids. The fantasy worlds of this movie are sinister and dark, somehow like the puberty the cast is undergoing. The movie is trying to grow up with its marketing goal group and trades its wondering of the magic into the fear of darkness and dying. The story hicks in my opinion, some parts are overexposed but don't add anything to the story,some inspiring things stay unrevealed and are walked over. At the end of the movie you are directly invited to go to the next movie I must say, i have never read a book from Harry Potter, so i cannot say if it is accurate or different. A lot of people seem to be content by this package. Watch and see it for yourself.",1
2067,10.0,"My Gosh. I just love Harry Potter so much. The movies and the characters are just amazing they really make it great. I would have to say i am just in love with Harry Potter Movies,Books,Collectables,and anything else that has to do with it. The movies are so great i would have to say i am obsessed with Harry Potter Movies. I love Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert gr int, and Emma Watson. They are all great they make the movies just wonderful. i would die if there was no more harry potter I'm the hugest, biggest, most obsessive fan. I just love it. I love the whole lot i wish i could meet the cast someday and get and autograph. I love them so much. They are indeed amazing. <3 Sam",1
2068,6.0,"I actually did not like this movie, I had a lot of expectations, and this movie let down most of them, there were no joined sequence, it was a bunch of clips put together, many characters were never introduced, and the ones that were, did not truly fulfill their character, also unnecessary parts were extended and the plot was very confusing unless one reads the book (which I did quite a lot of times before watching the movie). But if you love jokes and comedy, then you can go ahead and watch this movie, cause that was the only satisfying part of the movie. Also the character of Dumbledore was far from satisfying, as his outburst were never one of the characteristics of real Dumbledore.",0
2069,10.0,This was the best movie yet....it was full of so much excitement!!!! I saw the movie 3 times now and i could probably go see it again!!!! Harry is soooo cute in this movie!!! So is Ron and Hermione!!! I thought that Harry was going to die when they were in the water because he just all of a sudden started to freak out when he was about to get out of the water...I was so scared!!! I was out of my seat the whole movie especially when Harry and Voldemort was fighting!!! I loved the part when his parents came out of his wand to help him out and also when Cedric came out and told Harry to take his body back to Hogwarts with him. I was so close to crying when he brought back the body!!!! It was just so sad!!!,1
2070,1.0,"I did not like this movie at all. It cut out many characters and it only focused on the tournament. It was only 2.5 hours long for a 7?? page book but the Lord of the rings was 3 hour for a 300-400 page book. Personnaly I think they could have done a lot better. They could have also included Dobby and Winky in it. I know they had to shorten and make it good for younger children but still they could have added more. It had good special effects and all that but now days all they care about is making money. The book was a lot , lot better than the movie. Overall I would give this movie a 1. I would give it 7 for special effects and a 1-2 for following the storyline. I personally did not like it at all.",0
2071,1.0,"I go to the cinema with some family friends and I was terrified! Was the worst movie I ever seen. Really! A-W-F-U-L! I mean, what kind of people would watch at this movie? I think those who are ill with this dangerous virus named ,,harry potter''. Like I said before, I was at the cinema with some family friends and my mother. Those friends payed to go there! Their money went to the garbage. I'm not a harry potter fan, that's right, but the scenes in this movie were just...awful! I saw movies that were much, much better than this one. Like Radio Flyer. Radio Flyer was great. ",0
2072,9.0,"I felt that this movie was an excellent adaptation to the book, and by far the best HP yet. I was disappointed on some minor levels, but only because i am a die hard Harry Potter book fan. I felt that the writers did an excellent job in taking a 700 or so page book and turning it into a 2 and a half hour film. Though for many this may have been long, I was shocked at how short it was. It really kept you on the edge of your seat, never a dull moment...ever. I thought that acting was the best it ever has and that the actors themselves had made the film much easier to watch as a whole. In some of the previous films, there were some teeth grinding moments but in this one the acting was by far much smoother. Over all I loved the film and it is one of my personal favorites for 2005.",1
2073,8.0,"The first thing I have to consider when reviewing this movie, is whether or not to view it as a movie by it's self, or as an adaptation of the greatest children's book ever. I feel that it is impossible to consider the movie without comparing directly or indirectly to the book. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is by far the best movie of the series. Though in comparing it to the book is falls just a little short. There is so much that is good about this movie, I am reluctant to say that it is anything but perfect.",1
2074,7.0,"I must admit, after all the hubbub and excitement that had arisen around the Goblet of Fire, I went to the cinema in very high spirits and came out of it with mixed feelings. ",1
2075,8.0,"I anxiously awaited the release of GoF (as it is more commonly known to the Book Fans), biting my nails hoping against all hope that it wouldn't turn out to be ANYTHING like the fiasco called Prisoner of Azkaban. Imagine my pleasant surprise when the movie started and the first reaction I get to have is laughter. Sure, the Dursley's weren't in this one, which was mildly disappointing. I was REALLY hoping to see Mr. Weasley blast the fireplace apart, or to see the bully Dudley rolling around on the floor with a four foot long tongue. For the most part I laughed, but there were a few moments when I wanted to go through the screen and literally strangle certain characters; like Dumbledore when he nearly knocked Harry to the floor after the names came out of the Goblet. Or when they kept mispronouncing ""Accio!"" (Sidenote folks): it's not pronounced Ack-E-O, it's Ah-C-O. Yes, I know, they cannot do everything by-the-book. But at least pronounce the words correctly. And please, please, I beg of the directors and producers....AND Jo Rowling too...tell Gambon to ease up some. Dumbledore is NOT a violent man and that is exactly how he is playing him. One part that had me in absolute stitches was in the scene where Harry (Dan Radcliffe) is in the Prefect's Bath trying to figure out his clue for the second task and out pops one of my favorite recurring characters, Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson). The way she cuddled up to Harry while he was in that Olympic sized bathtub had me gasping for breath! BRAVO Shirley! The part of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) was slightly more...what's the word I'm looking for....energetic then I expected. But he played the part so well, in my opinion, that it was a non-issue. There were many ""small"" things that were left out of the movie, that some of our more passionate book fans were angry about, but as for myself, being an avid fan of the books, I have to say this one is a definite must-see for the people who are fans of the movies alone.",0
2076,3.0,"An awful adaption of Rowlings stunning masterpiece. Everything is far too unlike the book. I completely understand the crew's predicament. Trying to condense a 400 page novel into a movie is a difficult task, but they still could have made the movie a bit more like the book. Plot holes are like unavoidable craters in this film. Certain aspects of the film will only be understood by readers of the book's as they have previous knowledge. Movie-goers won't have a clue what is going on. The attempt to change Rowling's character's attributes crashed and burned and book fans will be able to distinctively see subjects and objects that are missing from the movie. I do though give credit to the crew for the effects and direction of cast but really should have focused more on the ""true"" detail of the movie through the book instead of adding extra nit-bits which were not needed in the movie.",0
2077,8.0,"Okay. First of all i have to let you know i am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter series. I have read all the books and watched all the movies. At the beginning of #4 i was very disappointed i would have liked to know what was going on, so people don't read the book so they are kind of clueless on how harry got to the camp,and how Ron got tickets, and that lord voldemort killed Frank and that he was talking to his pet snake. And not trying to sound to harsh cause i read the comment on the other page, But in movie two, Lord Voldemort looks completely diff. oh and another thing the game was no good ether. Sorry to those people who cant help it but J.K. don't let them mess-up your movie.",0
2078,5.0,"Well, first of all, I really loved this movie. I don't know if it's because I really love Harry Potter, or if it was because it really was fabulous, or both. The acting I thought really improved. In PoA it seemed more of a laid back type movie. In the book series, it's really the first one that has a real basis of the over all plot, and is a little darker than the fist two. This is not saying that the other two were just sort of there, but you have to admit that the point of the first one was basically to introduce, and the second one was, hmmm, I don't know. But not to stray too far from the point, I thought that some of the scenes in Goblet of Fire could have been a little longer. For example, the graveyard and Quidditch world cup scenes. In the book the cup takes like, four freaking chapters. In the movie it's gone in like a blink of the eye. Same with the graveyard. Lord of the Rings is three hours long, why can't Harry Potter be that way? I know it doesn't matter if you put stuff like S.P.E.W. in or not, but it would seem better to maybe finish a scene properly. But hey, I'm no director.",0
2079,7.0,"I liked this movie, but I thought it missed some important things. For one thing, I think they ought to have said who killed Barty Crouch - they never did. They never said much about Karkaroff's dark mark, or do much with Hermoine and Krum. THose were a few of the major things. And I think they ought to have had Harry's godfather, Sirus, in the movie more. Otherwise, it's a great movie. It told all about the Triwizard tournament, the three tasks, and Daniel Radcliffe did a great job acting, I think. I especially like the part in the graveyard, with Wormtail and Harry. I think that the special effects were great too. The first Triwizard task is, I think, the best. It's quite thrilling to see Harry flying and trying to dodge fiery blasts.",1
2080,6.0,"It was a good movie but it was just way to choppy and missing out on many crutial details. If I hadn't already read the book I would have been completely confused and lost. There wasn't very great transitions in between the tasks and characters weren't very well described and were given no background information. I mean don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but it just flat out didn't live up to the book. I loved the special effects with the dragons and the mermaids though, also the scene with Voltemort in the graveyard was pretty decent. I was just disappointed on how many details were left out about many key creatures and characters that come on later on in the series and what make the book so magical and entertaining, such as the sirens, as they never mentioned. The maze was very poorly done I would say too, all it was was a harmless maze with a bunch of attacking bushes and branches. Where were the creatures like the blasted-ended srewts and the boggart? The most disappointing thing I would have to say though was the conclusion. in the book it set up a great cliff-hanger, the movie didn't. They were no arguments between Fudge and Dumbledore which set up the great conflict between the minisrty and Dumbledore.",0
2081,5.0,"Even though the special effects were fantastic of course, I personally feel that the director butchered too much out of this movie. Not only that but he changed certain chronological pieces of the movie to shape where he saw fit. The director originally wanted to do this movie in 2 separate segments, he should have stuck to that plan. I understand that movies can never hold the amount or be as explicit as the books, I however as an avid reader was extremely disappointed in this movie. I feel the 4th book was one of the best in the series, sadly this 4th movie being the worst so far. I can only have hope for the future movies.......",0
2082,4.0,"In this part of the Potter movies, directed by Mike Newell, there is a lot of danger and destruction, and Harry is introduced to newer, more dangerous things. Mike Newell was clearly trying to settle his camera upon one main thing: teenage love. ",0
2083,9.0,"OK, this movie was awesome by far, but I have to say I like the third somewhat more than this one. I mean it was good, great affects, and the story line was good but I think it moved a little too fast. If I'm not mistaken, in the book the students of Hogwarts had a bit of time before the other two schools arrived. And the tasks...they were good until the third, what was up with the bushes being the only thing besides each other that was challenging them, I was so excited to see all of the things that he was to face, only to be disappointed to see that there was nothing. But, with all of my negative criticism towards the movie,I have to give the entire cast and crew kudos on the graveyard scene, awesome, it lighetend my mood. Especially the death of Cederic, I mean we all knew he was going to die(or at least the people who had read the books) but just the way the film-makers did it so well it made me feel sad and almost as if I hadn't expected it. Being a die hard Harry Potter fan I suppose my criticism comes somewhat from this being my favorite installment of the series so far. I have many complaints about this movie but overall I really like it.",1
2084,4.0,k so it was an Awesome movie great graphics and everything and it lived up to all the hype but why cant anyone make a movie that lives up to the book they left SO much out! but i totally understand i mean the book is really long but a lot of important stuff was left out! if i hadn't read the book everything with Barty crouch Jr would've confused the hell out of me! and i was really looking forward to seeing what they would do with the maze and what they did was cool but this supposedly deadly maze consisted of moving hedges and nothing else! in the book there were dementors and a sphinx and so much stuff they could have made the maze AMAZING and they didn't. The grave yard scene on the other hand AMAZING i was so happy with it!,1
2085,10.0,i've seen the movie at least three times and i still think that it is brilliant and Harry and Cedric still look the best. i would recommend this film to anyone who likes Harry Potter and hasn't seen the film yet. i think that this film is the best and the darkest one of all four of the films so far. i think that the funniest parts of the film are when Malfoy gets turned into a ferret and when Snape is stood behind Harry and Ron pulling his sleeves down ready to push their heads towards their work. any one who hasn't seen any of the films yet should watch them because they are all brilliant. i can't wait for the fifth film to come out and i can't wait ti read and see what happens in the seventh book.,1
