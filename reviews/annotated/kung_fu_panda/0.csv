0,,"Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout.",1
1,,"'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids.",1
2,8.0,"(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.",1
3,7.0,"In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey – and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.",1
4,8.0,"I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.",1
5,10.0,"After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.",0
6,9.0,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.",1
7,10.0,"I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\",1
8,10.0,"I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.",1
9,10.0,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.",1
10,8.0,"""Kung Fu Panda"" is easily the best film ever made by the Dreamworks animation studio. It was even better than ""Shrek"" and ""Over the Hedge"" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more ""Alive"" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like ""300"" or ""Pathfinder"". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable and likable characters. This is one of the best films of the 2008, along with ""Wall-E"". ",1
11,10.0,"One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.",1
12,10.0,"Caught a screening of ""The Panda"" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I! ",1
13,8.0,I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.,1
14,9.0,"I had the fortune of seeing this film the same day I saw another Dreamworks film in the theater--MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. Because of this experience, I think I enjoyed KUNG FU PANDA much more, as by comparison it was a much better film. In fact, though the Oscar folks would heartily disagree, I even enjoyed it more than last year's Oscar winner, WALL-E. That's because while these other films looked exceptionally nice, KUNG FU PANDA actually looked as good but offered a lot more entertainment and fun. Sure, it wasn't as deep as WALL-E, but it was enjoyable and didn't try to be a message film. And MONSTERS VS. ALIENS had a great idea, but the laughs were rather sparse.",1
15,9.0,"I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).",1
16,9.0,"Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.",1
17,10.0,"It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.",1

20,10.0,"I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black.

24,10.0,"There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",1

Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that.

30,9.0,"Went to see Kung Fu Panda on Saturday with very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in fact, it was better than I thought. I was funny and it has a lot of action and adventure. It is also a movie that leaves you some valuable learning like ""never give up"" and ""always believe in yourself"". A very good story about an Enthusiastic, big and a little clumsy, Po is the biggest fan of kung fu around which doesn't exactly come in handy while working every day in his family's noodle shop.

But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. It is like a tribute to all those Chinese kung fu movies.

32,8.0,"Jack Black is on form with his latest outing 'Kung-Fu Panda' a funny and excellently animated tale of dreams, ambition, self belief and of course Kung-Fu. Po is a panda stuck in his job at his dads noodle shop but as he cooks and serves he secretly dreams of being a Kung-Fu master and part of crack fighting force 'The furious five'. Trained by Shifu the five are being groomed so one will become the Dragon master and protect the village from the wrath of the evil Tai Lung and in a hilarious set up that task falls to the reluctant Po. Cue comedy training scenes and 'Karate Kid' style balances on one leg as the clumsy and unfit Po tries to become the ultimate fighting force. With an all star cast of voice talent here, Black, Hoffman, Jolie and Chan to name but a few, the characters are instantly likable, but what sets this film apart is really the animation which is simply stunning and often uses matrix style slow motion to great effect as the camera whirls you round a fight scene that just stays the right side of not making you dizzy. The story despite being heavy on the morale of believing in yourself and you can do anything rhetoric is a strong one and the script is full of great jokes. Add to this some fun slapstick and it should have the adults laughing along with the kids. To quote Po 'there is no charge for awesomeness' well the price of a cinema ticket anyway, but I assure you its well worth it.",1

And as others have noted, despite the lack of any real originality (Kung Fu Animals have been long existed in Chinese fantasy literature/ animation, see 1965's ""Uproar in Heaven"")-- Kung Fu Panda is done with such style and skill (or the Chinese would say, ""Kung Fu"") that it easily explains, again, why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die.",1

Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humilityall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.",1

The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite.

Today, though, my friend wanted to go, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the best movies I've seen this year. I was first struck by the art work... not the CG/animation but the artwork, the backgrounds and sets of the scenes. They're stunningly beautiful, as is the soundtrack. Then the story pulled me in, even the minor things like why a Panda has a goose for a father. I really liked the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-type action scenes; they were really well done, using the characteristics of each character to add to what the character was able to do. The villain was especially well done, intimidating but not over-the-top scary that would scare small children. (There were many children in the theatre of course, but the movie kept them interested apparently because they were all well-behaved, engrossed in the movie.) The acting was well done as well. I'd wondered if Jack Black would be as funny when you can't see his physical humor, but I shouldn't have worried. I read a review of the movie this week that said Angelina Jolie wasn't very good. I'm not really a fan of hers, but I don't know what movie that reviewer saw; I thought she was great. In fact, I wish there had been more scenes and actions with the 5 Kung Fu warriors, the Monkey, the Snake, the Mantis, the Tiger and the Stork. They were all excellent as was the Kung Fu Master, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Hopefully, there will be a sequel (done as well as this one was) and we will see more of those characters, and find out about Po's father.",1

51,7.0,"I am not a big fan of Dreamworks' non-Aardman movies after Shrek. They used too many jokes, pop-culture references etc. instead of serving real story with real characters. The only exception is, I think, Over the Hedge, which, while not really Pixar-standard, is one where they didn't overuse pop-culture references but gave us lovable characters and a good story. I think Kung Fu Panda is closer to Over the Hedge than other Dreamworks-movies. Actually I didn't find real pop-culture references (while there may be a lot of references to martial arts movies - I lack knowledge of them - there is nothing that does not fit to the story and the characters) at all. Slapstick is very childish in the movie; I can understand that, they wanted to sell it to the little ones too. But other than that, and most of the time, it is a beautifully-animated kung-fu movie with great scenery that is more for adults and kung-fu movie lovers than for children. They even give time for character building, although it is only for the Panda and the two masters; others are really one-dimensional (they even don't really have too much screen time for more). The story is nothing new, but maybe that's not something you would expect from a Kung-fu movie. All in all, the movie is much more fun and sensitive but with less jokes than its ads suggest. i did like it even if I didn't love it - maybe you should be a kung-fu fan for the latter.",0

When the test for the Dragon Warrior is announced, Po hopes at very least to be an observer of the contest. So imagine his surprise when he finds himself to be the one chosen. Trainer Shifu and his students are sceptical at least and furious at worst, but are confident that Po will soon quit, but they do not count on the sheer, good natured pleasure that Po takes from just being involved. Thing is, what Po doesn't know is that the Dragon Warrior is prophesied as the only one who can stop the powerful and evil Tai Lung, who has just broken free of a prison of one prisoner and a thousand guards.",1
53,10.0,"My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far. I have seen almost all of them (toystory,incredibles,ratatullie,shrek,iceAge you name it). But KungFuPanda beats all of them. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made us laugh like anything. Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !! He blends into PO as if he was born to voice for PO. Dustin Hoffman suits perfect for Master Shifu. Dreamworks has surprisingly given an awesome anime picture. ",1

There are especially no accidents when no risk is taken. That panda is of course the panda from the title and from the moment this lazy emotional eater is ""discovered"" as the warrior that will go on to save the kingdom, you know exactly how the entire thing will play out. Po (voiced by an increasingly subtle Jack Black) will drown in doubt while he trains for something he doesn't believe himself capable of; the other animals will badger him into giving up; but eventually, he will find his inner kung fu master and save the day.

The voice acting was top notch, the 3D animation good, the funny animal faces perfect. But it was so incredibly predictable, that it brought only a type of indifferent fun for me. Maybe it was because I have seen old Jackie Chan movies and I knew how things will go, PG rated and everything, but every single little scene was in my head before it happened.",1
61,,"In one respect, the concept of a ""kung fu panda"" is an appropriate one. Kung fu is Chinese; pandas come from China. In other respects, however, it seems hilariously inappropriate. Pandas are widely regarded as placid, inoffensive animals, the least carnivorous of the Carnivora. Indeed, for many years zoologists denied them their rightful place in the bear family, categorising them instead as a sort of overgrown raccoon, as if unwilling to allow the noble name of the family Ursidae to be sullied by the inclusion therein of a creature which subsists on a staple diet of bamboo shoots. Even the name by which the giant panda has become known in English was borrowed from a much smaller animal, the red panda.",0
62,9.0,"This is a Dreamworks animated feature, a story about a noodle-shop worker panda named Po, who is the biggest fan of Kung Fu. Chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po joins an elite Kung-Fu group and trains alongside the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. Their trainings come in handy when they must battle the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung.",1
63,9.0,"While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes (parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training), I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) was teaching Po (Jack Black). In fact, this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features. Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students: Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). The villain, Tai Lung (Ian McShane), was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years. Also of interest is Mr. Ping, Po's restaurateur father (James Hong), who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first. Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect (perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it). So on that note, this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did. P.S. I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie (which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here).",1

We were all either laughing and grinning most of the way through. The action sequences are superb and there are a lot of them without being violent. I also enjoyed a lot of the message in this movie although it seemed like something you would find in a fortune cookie. There was almost no dull moment, the action sequences were a lot better than a lot of CGI movies that should have been more about the action. The visual were great and the story is very engaging and moving although it's a very simple and straightforward story that isn't all that original. But it still carries the movie very well to the point it's more than passable. A lot of the characters also stands out and they all have their redeeming qualities. Without giving away the whole story, this movie was more than what I expected, way more.

70,8.0,Jack Black is perfectly cast as Po in this film. It is a great adventure of epic proportions and has some good humour as well. The animation and action scenes really stand out here with all the fluid martial arts. The characters are memorable and the story has a good emotional arc.,1
71,9.0,"Kung Fu Panda is both a send-up of and a tribute to the kung-fu genre, and it works. Innocent eyes will goggle at the beautifully rendered characters, break-neck action, and gentle humor; more experienced viewers will laugh at loud at all of the kung fu movie clichés... a hopeless loser that goes from zero to hero in about one day of intense training... a promising but evil student who turns against his master... the wise, ancient master... the prophesy... the various forms of animal-style kung-fu practiced by actual creatures of the correct type... it's all there, without any wires, and without the awful dialogue you would expect from a chop-sockey film. Jack Black entertains, and shares some excellent dialogue with Master Sifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. The Furious Five, a group of powerful Kung Fu warriors, is voiced by various big-name actors, but somehow, they rarely seemed to get enough voice-time to justify those big salaries - particularly Jackie Chan (Monkey), who had about three lines of dialogue. Presumably they based Monkey's movements on some of Jackie's more inspired moves from the past. This is where the film lost a point. An honorable mention should be given to James Hong, who voices Po's (Jack Black, the Panda) father's voice - apparently, PO is the son of a goose who owns a noodle shop. Ian McShane also deserves mention as Tai Lung, the immensely powerful evil Snow Leopard kung-fu master who must escape from prison and return to the valley in order to fulfill PO's destiny. See this movie. It brought awesomeness back to a genre that has seen a lot of crap in the past 5 years (anything with Star Wars in the title, anything starring Jackie Chan, anything directed by the Wachowski Brothers...), and it's even clean enough to bring your kids to.

The kind of freedom a virtual camera gives to animation is something they've been working properly, at a world class level in Ratatouille. That's the top of it, so far, to my taste.

Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected.

However, when it comes to the visuals, there is nothing to fault, the whole film with its gorgeous colours and backgrounds looks wonderful. The score is excellent as well, and I can see that there was care to make it sound authentic. The script is witty, funny and smart, the pace is bright and breezy and the voice acting is solid across the board- Dustin Hoffmann is perfectly cast while Jack Black does a great job voicing one of his more likable characters.

I have always regarded Jack Black as a tolerable supporting player who, for some reason I can't quite fathom (although it seems to have something to do with some people finding him quite a bit funnier than I do), has achieved leading man status. That overall opinion hasn't changed, but that doesn't stop me recognising his voice work here as very, very good. The same goes for Dustin Hoffman, with a special mention for James Hong. The other voice artists are also good, but the parts they play don't really demand the names which play them - Jackie Chan has, what? five lines? Something like that.",0

I think that kids would especially love this movie. Even older kids and teenagers can enjoy this movie. I sure do know adults that take their kids to see it will have a fun time. Its fun to relive your history and go back to movies like these. Jack Black was perfect and was a riot in this. The facial expressions he makes pretty much will make you laugh out loud. When I had first seen the trailer to this movie it didn't seem to catch my eye but after the good reviews I went to see it and it was really good. Their was a ton of action for younger kids. It wasn't to long so you don't have to sit through a long movie. Overall this was a very fun family comedy. GO see it if you like animated action movies. This is a real gift to see. This is coming from someone who doesn't care for animated movies. So for me to like this one it means it has to be good. They also made the panda and other characters look very good.

Perhaps because I've also been a martial arts movie fan for most of my life, I was looking forward to KUNG FU PANDA. My own KUNG FU CATS (which also featured a hero named Po) was available for quite some time online (at fanboycomics.biz)- until the site went down- but it certainly wasn't written down to the video game level of KUNG FU PANDA.

This is just an average movie where everything is well done but no connection was made with the characters on my behalf. Admittedly most of the children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film (but I felt even they would of enjoyed it more). The animation is strong though I found the fight scenes a bit like watching a computer game. But I just was not taken with any of the characters and the main character of the Panda just did not do it for me, there was just too much Jack Black here and not enough character.

Po's character development is great and enjoyable, the characters of the Furious Five are given the spotlight for some time. The plot is great and Po is challenged and put up to the test to see if he truly is a Kung Fu Panda warrior. A lot of fun, enjoyment out of the cool action and adventure. DreamWorks has found a premise for some great sequels and more action to come to the big screen.",1
145,8.0,"I have to say before watching this movie and hearing the title I thought to myself that it has to be the dumbest name for a film ever. The film looked like it was going to suck judging from the trailers.But as it turned out after watching this I found myself engaged and interested in what was going on. This movie is a perfect example of never judge a book by it's cover. The story of the film was very simple yet it was funny, cute, charming, likable and it can be pretty serious at times.The Animation was very impressive and colorful, the facial expressions on the animals looked great and there movements on them were great to. The soundtrack was very good and the action scenes were very entertaining. The acting was good and the characters were all fun to watch. If i had to point any flaws to the film would be two things, the furious five while pretty cool didn't have many lines and it would've been nice to have more development from them. The bad guy Tai lung wasn't a terrible bad guy since he was a cool fighter and he had a good voice that fits him well, but he was underdeveloped and could've been better.Overall Kung Fu panda is a great film that teaches people that they can do anything in life if they put there minds to it no matter what flaws they have.",1
146,8.0,"Warning: I believe the movie is a bit scary for the very young, I think this movie should be rated PG or even PG 13. Shrek is a wonderful movie because it upends a lot of conventions, in fairy tales and in animated movies. The next few Shreks become weaker echoes of the first by doing the same movie over and over, and by existing to parody other movies without bothering to put in a meaty story to string the jokes. Kung Fu Panda is another movie that upends a lot of recent animated movie conventions that have become cliché. Firstly, it isn't anymore a joke a minute. Some care was used in telling the story. In a way, it breaks current convention by becoming a more old-fashioned movie, by taking its time with the story. And yet, there are many touches that are clear tributes to previous great Kung Fu movies, especially Jacky Chan movies. The movie is going to be rewarding even to adults, so they aren't going to mind bringing their kids to this movie. It helps that Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman strike such witty rapport with each other. If anything becomes pretty conventional or dull, I can depend on either actor to give it a nice reading. Not necessarily a funny reading, but at least a reading that's consistent with the character. Definitely worth getting on Blu-ray!",1

He also never imagined having to fight the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane), who is as mean and vicious as villains come. The reluctant fighter gets help in preparing for his showdown from Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), and the interaction between teacher and student provide many of the laughs. There's a lot more going on around this simple storyline, and the movie is filled with comedy and action from start to finish. The animation is brilliantly done, the characters' facial expressions are priceless while the kung fu action is flawless. Although much of the humor is action-based, there's also much wit and satire in the script along with a good dose of tenderness and heart. Among the many lovable characters, my favorites are Po, Master Shifu and Master Oogway, an even older and wiser teacher who decided that there's no reason why an ordinary panda cannot be a superhero if he just believed in himself.",1
153,5.0,"First, let me say my niece enjoyed the movie quite a bit...this was her first movie so it was a new experience for her. If I was rating the movie on her thoughts on it I would have rated it higher. However, I paid money to see this one too, and I have to say I just thought it would be funnier. Jack Black is great as the voice of the Panda as was all the cast, though I thought the five warriors were rather ignored for the most part with the Tigress one sort of stepping up a bit. The movie was just to talky for me with way to many serious moments. I will draw a parallel if I may. The first hour of Shrek had me laughing a bit and was rather good. The last half hour I did not laugh much at all and I thought it dragged down the rest of the film. This whole movie seemed more like the last half hour of Shrek rather than the first hour. It had a few cute parts here and there, but for me it just did not deliver the goods, the preview for Madagascar 2 looked better than this one. The story has a Panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu hero ending up being the chosen dragon warrior to the dismay of a master of kung fu and his students. A villain escapes and is on his way to challenge the dragon warrior and nothing to surprising happens along the way. A few chuckles to be sure in the ending fight, and scattered throughout the movie, just not enough for my tastes. However, my niece loved it so it is a good movie for kids anyway.",1
154,8.0,"This was a delightful film. The deep rich color, the contrast, most of the caricature development and voices seem to come together to make a wonderful experience. The story follows the dream of a fat panda and his desire to be trained in the ways of Kung Fu. Laced with a serious overtone, the comedy is on a more mature level, but a level that even a young child can follow and enjoy. Paced well, the movie starts off as well as it ends.

It's predictable stuff for sure, child-friendly but without possessing that spark of magic that the old Disney films used to have.

True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it. The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children. A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie. Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache. It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development. For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck). I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults. And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie. And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen. It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic. Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted.",0
159,4.0,"Kung Fu Panda (2008): Dir: John Stevenson, Mark Osborne / Voices: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan: Disappointing animation about reaching full potential, which is something this overrated animation never does. Simple plot regards panda Po dreaming of becoming a Kung Fu fighter. When he is accidentally deemed Dragon Master his master sets about to prove him unskilled. For starters, being part of this film should be deemed unskilled enough. Chalk full of stereotypes and clichés with only the animated images to shine. Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne who oversee the colourful images. Only Jack Black as Po really comes alive. He is a dreamer whose dreams are met but the idea of facing off against the snow leopard is something predicted long before it happens. Dustin Hoffman as the Yoda-like Kung Fu master is tiring. How many miniature creatures sporting wise words have to be Kung Fu teachers? Angelina Jolie as Tigress wants to move ahead thus she will have issues with Po that will evaporate when he proves himself. Ian McShane voices the tyrant villain whose destiny is to escape prison and beat up every Kung Fu warrior save for Po who will save the day.

161,8.0,"Since the explosion of computer generated animation onto the big screen in recent years, Dreamworks has been the main perpetrator in overexposing the world to the genre. For every brilliant, nurtured and expertly crafted Pixar creation there is a lazy Dreamworks equivalent, heavily relying on pop culture references and famous voice talent to disguise the fact that the films suck. Yes, I'm including Shrek in this. It is a bad movie and after just seven years looks ridiculously dated. So what does any of this have to do with Kung Fu Panda? Well, because somehow Dreamworks have managed to perform a complete U-turn in their thinking and release an animated movie that isn't just good, it is excellent. I say 'somehow,' although it doesn't take William James Sidis to realise that when Pixar are receiving ten times more critical and commercial acclaim than you are, following their blueprint for success might just be a good idea.",1

One of the coolest things about Kung Fu Panda is that it seems to celebrate some of these individual styles, representing them with its own animal.

Animation movie is, I think, a cheat movie, you can always create a world or story without too much worry of its properties or safety. Of course, you can always said, it is not logical, it's odd.

We've had many movies similar to this with the talking animals and an unlikely hero, but then here we are where the animals must do kung fu and a snake(with no teeth) uses a damned ribbon as a weapon. And then there's the panda,who somehow ends up being ""the chosen one"" because a turtle points at him after he landed in front of someone else.

It is underrated simply due to the fact that there are people who won't watch this movie because it is animated and targeted for kids, when it actually does a plethora of things better than your average blockbuster.",0
169,5.0,"I saw a trailer and maybe a few clips of this cartoon film and thought it looked like it would be fun, I didn't see it at the cinema, but I wasn't going to miss it when I got the opportunity. Basically Po (Jack Black) is the lazy tongue-in-cheek slacker giant panda, and he is the biggest fan of Kung Fu, but his (adoptive) father the Chinese goose Zeng (Dan Fogler) wants him to keep working at his family noodle shop. After trying to watch his favourite kung fu team, the legendary Furious Five: Tigress the South China tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross); Po falls into the arena and it looks like he is unintentionally chosen as the one to fulfil the ancient prophecy. Oogway the Galápagos tortoise (Randall Duk Kim) says he is correct about his choice of who will become the Dragon Warrior, but Master Shifu the red panda (Dustin Hoffman) is unconvinced, but the panda does study and train alongside his idols. Po and the Furious Five are unaware that the big threat and vengeful former kung fu student to Shifu, Tai Lung the snow leopard (Ian McShane), has escaped captivity and is heading their way. Po meanwhile, despite loving being next to his idols, he also also does not think he is the correct choice as the Dragon Warrior, but after some assurance by Shifu he gains the confidence to complete training. He also gets the chance to see the legendary Dragon Scroll, and after a little while of confusion as to its meaning, being blank and reflective, he feels ready enough to face Tai Lung and defeat him. In the end, after using the secret Wuxi Finger Hold to defeat the villain leopard, Po is praised by his five fellow warriors, Shifu and all of the Valley of Peace, becoming a true kung fu master. Also starring Michael Clarke Duncan as Commander Vachir the Javan Rhinoceros, Wayne Knight as Gang Boss and Tenacious D's Kyle Gass as KG Shaw. Black is really likable as the fat endearing character, and the supporting cast all do well also, the story is easy to follow, and the computer animation is just as good as what we've seen in Shrek and Madagascar, it is suitable and enjoyable for all ages, a fun animated comedy adventure.

Every element of the movie resembles an old Asian kung fu movie. The fight scenes are very memorable and you can tell the animators worked hard on them. One of the things I did hate about the movie is the casting of the voice actors. The ""Furious Five"" are supposed to be great kung fu fighters and stuff, and are voiced by celebrities. However, they barely have any importance to the story. And it seemed like Angelina Jolie's Lion character was the only important one. Jackie Chan was the monkey, and he literally had only two lines!

202,7.0,"As you've probably expected, Jack Black is in this as he is in most else you'll see him in... if you find him irritating elsewhere(as I do), this won't be an exception. And it won't surprise you to find that this has about as much slapstick as can be fit into a 90 minute running time. However, beyond the typically silly and childish humor, this does genuinely have things to offer, for those not sold on what I've just described. The drama is actually pretty good, and rings true. This also lets its villain be more than the usual two-dimensional, diabolical maniac that far too many stories settle for. The action is awesome, and there's a ton of it. Animation is excellent, and the design is great. Use of color and lighting is effective. The cast is marvelous, though it seems a tad wasted, with the kind of talent they got, it seems like they were given kind of few lines. Cross is a little hit and miss, and I think it's mainly the fault of the material. There is no strong language, and the violence is mild, though parts of this are intense. The DVD comes with an informational director's commentary, two featurettes, a Dreamworks Video Jukebox, trailers, a game you play by the remote, and a PSA kind of thing for the conservation of wild Pandas. I recommend this to fans of full-CGI flicks, those who made this and/or martial arts. 7/10",1

While there is a ton of humor in this (the turtle always makes me crack up), there are some great underlying storylines in this around self confidence, being yourself and having a sense of self worth. There's some great lessons in this. I also loved the way the father/son and teacher/student relationships are depicted.

207,7.0,"Decent animated entertainment from Dreamworks, the poor man's Pixar. Except for Shrek, which I despised, Dreamworks' animated films have been rather enjoyable, if unremarkable, and Kung Fu Panda continues this trend. Jack Black voices Po, a fat, clumsy panda who dreams of kung fu while working in a noodle shop. One day, he is chosen by a kung fu master to be the next dragon warrior, the one who will defeat über-villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane). Will he embarrass himself, or will at some point realize that, if he believes in himself, he can accomplish anything? Only the stupidest children can't figure that one out. Other voices are provided by Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Michael Clark Duncan. Jesus. Just think about how much money Dreamworks wasted on all these people. Jackie Chan, for instance, has possibly one line in the entire movie, and probably made a million dollars for it. The movie itself is enjoyable, especially during the action sequences, which go by a little too fast but are well choreographed. The storyboarders had their work cut out for them. The artwork is probably the best looking Dreamworks has yet conceived, but compare it to the visionary WALL-E and it's clear that this studio is just for kids.",0

210,9.0,"'Kung Fu Panda (2008)' tells the now timeless tale of an affable, Kung-fu-crazy panda who's thrust into the spotlight, and then forced to face an almost unstoppable foe, when an ancient martial arts master names him the elusive 'Dragon Warrior'. What it does better than nearly all others of its ilk is hit home its incredibly powerful, wonderfully positive message (""there is no secret ingredient"") in a scene that never fails to make me tear up. This profound message - which, for my money, might just be the best ever committed to animation - is paired with a bevy of otherwise marvellous themes to create a holistic, layered experience that's as affecting as it is entertaining. The central dynamic between our protagonist, Po, and his reluctant master, Shifu, is supremely satisfying; it leads to some truly excellent development of both players, marked by their relationship to the secondary characters as well as to each other. Even if the supporting cast generally don't get full arcs like Po and Shifu do, they all feel as rounded and relatable as they need to be. The humbly wise and usually prophetic Oogway represents someone truly at peace with their place in the world, interestingly playing out the classic 'mentor' role for the actual mentor and student of the movie, whereas the charmingly confident and uncompromisingly callous Tai Lung (perhaps the third most developed role and an overall intriguing antagonist) represents someone who cannot accept who they are, which leads to a phenomenal piece of puppeteered performance late-on when he unexpectedly receives an apology instead of his perceived 'reward'. The film is generally quite traditional, with characters who fill archetypal roles and a structure that's known as a fundamental cinematic technique. However, it does this with flair and maintains a firm grasp on its characters and themes throughout. Because of this, it ends up as a very tight and rewarding experience that comes together as neatly as possible and doesn't waste a single scene. It's just so well-written. It also has its roots in Chinese culture and martial arts movies, taking a page from a multitude of books to come up with its own visual and narrative style that's sort of adjacent to 'Wuxia'. This gives it a unique, visually appealing aesthetic when compared to 'western' animation of the era, even if the basics of its movement are consistent with the then (and even now) favoured more 'realistic' approach. The fight sequences are inventive, fast-paced and energetic. They're exaggerated yet grounded, with a focus far more on the fluidity of movement than on the brutality of battle. The complex bridge bout is technically masterful, the emotionally-charged father/son face-off is visually stunning and the sprawling final brawl is gratifying as it is fun. Each action scene is used to push the narrative, or the character development, in some meaningful way and they all look and feel unique, reflecting not only the fighting styles of the combatants but also their personalities. Bringing the latter to life is an excellent voice cast, probably one of the best assembled for an animated affair. However, it would have been nice if the cast had included a few more Asian actors to reflect its setting - adding to the already present Lucy Liu, James Hong, Randall Duk Kim and Jackie Chan. I feel this lack of representation is reflective of the piece's age rather than its intentions, but it's still worth mentioning. It's almost inconceivable that this is made by the same studio as 'Bee Movie (2007)': it's easily one of the best animated movies of the twenty-first century. Along with only, perhaps, 'Shrek (2001)' and 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', it totally blows DreamWorks Animations' otherwise relatively stale reputation right out of the water. In fact, I'd even say it gives Pixar a good run for their money. It's highly enjoyable, emotionally affecting and thematically rich. Plus, I haven't even mentioned how funny it can be or the fact that its score is one of the best I've ever heard. It truly is awesome. 9/10",1

224,8.0,"13 June 2008. The amazing blend of animation, sometimes unfamiliar voices from known actors, and the strong script make for a compelling and surprisingly well-told story-based animated movie. While the animation wasn't as always sharp or realistic as some recent movies, it some ways it made for a better movie as it was told periodically in fantastical, magical ways. Jack Black's character and his on-screen persona was softened with references to Mr. Black's sometimes obnoxious comedic antics while Dustin Hoffman's wise sage role also dampened Mr. Hoffman's sometimes redundant on-screen persona. Mr. Hoffman's character in some ways brought out a finely nuanced, new side of Mr. Hoffman's acting ability and character something that was well captured in one of his previous outstanding roles in Tootsie (1982). As for the rest of the cast, such as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, they are for the most past unrecognizable as their on-screen personalities and this was well and good for it made the movie have to stand more on its own that depend on their past characters but on their acting abilities to bring to the screen new characters. Only James Hong, a well-known Asian character actor's role was strongly presented, the father of Jack Black's character. Overall, this animated feature blended strong moral lessons along with creative martial art scenes and comedic humor that all came together to make this movie an entertaining, but emotionally sensitive movie. The only important element missing was the edgy, biting realism that today's more contemporary mature audience requires. Eight out of Ten Stars.",1
225,8.0,"Kung Fu Panda is the best animated movie I've seen since Finding Nemo. It's the story about Po, a fat-bellied panda, who dreamed of becoming a master of kung fu although his father thinks that he'd one day take over their family business of selling noodle soups. The panda is good at making noodle soups but he knows better that he's destined for something bigger. One day the village is threatened by a villain named Tai Lung, a power-seeking snow leopard. Po is somehow designated as THE dragon warrior who would save the town. I wouldn't go too much in details so not to spoil anyone but this animated picture has a very important message. Sometimes you wish you had a magic wand to make your imperfections go away or transform yourself into someone else. The truth is there's no such thing as magic wands. You got to believe in yourself first before people can believe in you. And you got to work hard to get to your dreams. So that's pretty much the plot behind the legend of the legendary warrior. The CG-animated work in Kung Fu Panda is so much detailed that it's breathtaking. I particularly liked at the end of the movie when they showed a close-up of Master Shifu (Po's kung fu master) waiting for the return of Tai Lung. You can clearly see the wind brushing his fur. The fighting scenes (and believe me there's plenty of them) are spectacular and would make envious any live-action kung fu movies. Some characters were underdeveloped or had no real purpose like most of the Furious Five except maybe for Tigress. However, Jack Black cast as Po did a remarkable job. Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu was a real treat as well as Ian McShane who played the voice of the fearful Tai Lung. Finally, there's no single moment you won't find yourself cracking a smile or bursting out in laughter while watching Kung Fu Panda. It's a must-see!",1
226,8.0,"Dreamworks Animation, after the mediocre third installment of the Shrek series, hasn't really been outstanding. Rather, it had dimmed in the shadows of oblivion. It's major rival Disney, on the other hand, has been successful with films like Wall E. But now with a star-studded cast and a smart script, DreamWorks makes a comeback with Kung Fu Panda, which is a film filled with ""awesomeness"". Jack Black does the voice of Po the Panda, and he does it great. Every scene Po is in belongs to him, in other word it makes the other characters look inferior, not weight-wise, although he is a pretty big animal. Another thing about this film is the absence of humans. Every character in the film is an animal whether a tiny insect or a frightening rhino. That sets the frivolous mood of the film, although it's not as frivolous as some might expect it. Had its fair share of plot twists and great jokes. Oh yeah lots of great jokes.

While its relatively simple tale of an underdog who has been laughed at throughout his entire life learning to fulfil his unexplored potential is nothing new, it remains effortlessly entertaining and the kind of film you can catch halfway through and still enjoy what it has to offer. Although the title promises plenty of fat jokes, and there are certainly plenty, the film goes beyond simply appealing to kids with sight gags by working in Chinese mysticism, some wonderful voice acting, and stunning animation that would only get better and more ambitious as the series went on.",1
232,9.0,"Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po (an overweight, underachieving panda) who spends his days serving noodles at his father's restaurant and his nights dreaming of kung fu greatness. When the wise Master Oogwei (a tortoise) foretells the return of a deadly warrior who is bent on exacting revenge on their village, he and Master Shifu (a red panda) must find the fabled Dragon Warrior who is destined to save them all. Much to everyone's surprise, and seemingly by accident, Master Oogwei chooses Po. With entire village's fate in his hands, Po must face the countless doubters all around him as well as the doubt in his own heart.",1
233,7.0,"So the rather clumsy and inept ""Po"" has dreams of saving the world! His real job is working in a noodle bar where one day, maybe, he will learn the secret ingredient that gives their dishes that special flavour. Meantime, the ageing ""Oogway"", the most learned of creatures, has informed his stalwart lieutenant ""Shifu"" that he will soon have to defend their ""Valley of Peace"" from the vengeful ""Tai Lung"" who, though currently incarcerated in a seemingly impregnable prison, is set to come and wreak some havoc. ""Po"" is determined to attend the selection ceremony and, well yes - you've guessed. He ends up selected by the old wise turtle, much to the chagrin and general disbelief of just about everyone else. Hopeless, hapless and helpless - but can ""Po"" prove his mettle and save the day? It's really quite good fun this. The characterisations are well developed and it has humour and style to it too. The animations are lively, vivid and the directors avoid the temptation to allow the combat and action scenes to descend into the all-too-often realms of repetitiveness. There is a moral - the values of teamwork and trust, honesty, integrity yada yada, but the story delivers them in a gentle and demonstrable manner via the plot and the characters rather than pontificating. All in all, this is great family fun that shows the (not so) little guy doing his best... Can he save the day?",1
234,6.0,"A family-oriented parody animation, paying homage to the classic martial arts features that clearly inspired it. 'The Karate Kid', 'Enter The Dragon' and even 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' as a more obscure credit. Whilst not at the stylistic level of 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers', there are glimpses of cinematic allurement, yet the basic story and one-dimensional supporting cast of anthropomorphic animals prevented this flick from reading its own omnipotent dragon scroll. In ancient China, a kung fu enthusiastic panda named Po is nominated as the ""Dragon Warrior"" and must fulfil his destiny in vanquishing the antagonistic Tai Lung.",0

Jack Black voices a lovable overweight panda named Po, living in China selling noodles in a family business. Po has developed an interest in the ancient art of Kung Fu, but accepts that this interest can only be a dream and nothing else. This changes however, when he crashes a Kung Fu ceremony and is named the Dragon Emperor. Although the other Kung Fu students protest, their master proclaims 'there are no accidents'. Simultaneously, a Kung Fu master named Tai Lung, who was previously denied the title of the Dragon Emperor and became evil, has just escaped from prison and seeks revenge.

I wasn't all that excited about the switch to zero gravity that we saw in Crouching Tiger, but the impact and the sheer style of Shaolin Soccer was completely unexpected and pretty damned amazing. Also, the Shaolin Temple, where Chinese kung-fu originated, is about a 45-minute drive from where I live in central China. I've been there a couple times and the kung-fu shows that they put on are pretty spectacular.",1

Walking out of this I can say that my friend was right as this really does deliver for a movie called ""Kung Fu Panda."" ",1

Two big films of that year were The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and the Forbidden Kingdom. Hollywood was looking at the big market China and East Asia offers, and therefore the money making potential. Dreamworks animation is one of the biggest studios in the world and is on a mission to challenge Pixar for dominate. They have made some good films like Shrek, Shrek 2 and Antz. But they have made some real duds over the years, like Shark Tale, Bee Movie and The Road to El Dorado and ended an association with Aardman Animations which did lead to Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run. Luckily Kung Fu Panda is a return to form.",1
241,8.0,"Jack Black, playing completely against type, is an animated panda named Po who's been mistaken for the mystical, world-saving Dragon Warrior. Po's lack of ability - not to mention a recognizable waistline - runs counter to all that Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches, and it doesn't ingratiate him with his idols, the Furious Five, either. This fast-paced comedy adventure is heavier on actual culture than pop-culture references, which is forever to its credit, and the game work by Black and Hoffman aid the rather generic storyline (fat boy must overcome odds to beat skilled ninja) immeasurably.",1

A valiant attempt to outdo Pixar is slightly smouldered by its misuse of its supporting cast (Angelina Jolie, Luci Lu and Jackie Chan) However with the failure that was Shrek the Third this is a film that puts DreamWorks credibility back on the line, will it ever be as good as Pixar? Probably not but Kung Fu Panda proves it can (at very least) look better than Pixar.",1
249,6.0,"Like all other animations this movie sure took its time in developing the critical characters. Although maybe for this movie one might feel that it takes too much time in developing those characters that it feels that the character development still happens just until the main conflict, which is quite sudden for animation movie story flow. The jokes are absolutely funny, not necessarily because of the jokes itself, but because of Jack Black's comedic aura. I've watched two versions of this movie, one with original Enlish dialog with Jack Black's voice and one with dialog dubbed into Indonesian. The Indonesian version didn't have the jokes to be cracking laughs due to the dubber lacking Black's comedic prowess. The voice acting overall is nicely almost entirely Jack Black's influence. And that's quite fair in my view since his mark is all over the movie.",0

Comparable to other 3d movies like Shrek, Finding Nemo, Stuart Little... From best to worst: graphics, stunts, fun, story, and finally actors. This is one of those movies that actors can't be rated because their role is insignificant. Difficult to recognize voice of Angelina and Jackie, because voice looks modified. Funny, cool, but still best for kids. Not deep as some other fairytales and cartoons like Maleficent, but not far from that either. Recommended for kids.",1
259,8.0,"Standard DreamWorks fare, with adequate CGI and a long list of A-list voice actors. Actually, I almost would have enjoyed the entire movie in the animation style of the first few minutes, since I haven't seen a classical animation piece in a while.

We are in a movie where animals interact with each other in a civilized way and where they are so liberal as to consider it acceptable that a bird be considered the father of a panda bear. Added to that is an invitation to disbelief when you must give way to a story where the weakest character is the protagonist. The plot is an invitation to forgive unsustainable ideas such as ""you can always be whatever comes to mind if luck is on your side"" or ""if there are feelings everything is acceptable"".

Tai-Lung, played by Ian McShane, is one of the best cartoon villains since Shere Khan. Despite its limitations, ""Kung-Fu Panda"" is bound to have some redeeming qualities. There is no quirky cliche that is too boring for filmmakers to exploit. The narrative is rice paper thin, and the characters, while charming, are simply overpopulated.",0
280,7.0,"I have been avoiding the Kung Fu Panda juggernaut for the past four years. The Shrek sequels actually killed my enthusiasm for any animation made by DreamWorks (How to Train Your Dragon being the exception which proves the rule). A sequel has meanwhile come and become a blockbuster, there are various episodes released periodically by DreamWorks and most of my friends have become tired of recommending this. I finally succumbed because I wanted to watch something light and short in length. Po is a Panda in China who dreams of learning Kung Fu. His father wants him to run their family's noodle business which is the farthest thing from his mind. There is a mountain atop which there is a monastery. Here, Master Oogway, a turtle who is a Kung Fu master lives along with his disciple Shifu and five other animals Tigress, Mantis, Viper, Crane and Monkey. Oogway foresees an old student of Shifu, Leng, escaping from prison and coming back to claim the dragon scroll which is supposed to hold the secrets of being the ultimate fighter. He decides to find the next Dragon Warrior to take on Leng. The animals at the monastery are training hard as they are vying among themselves to be the next Dragon Warrior. By a strange quirk of fate, Po ends up selected as the Dragon warrior. The movie follows the adventures of Po as he is trained in the various martial arts and becomes ready for the ultimate showdown with Leng. The character of Po is very cute and his antics are endearing. I could relate to him totally as I am a big foodie myself. He is voiced brilliantly by Jack Black. Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, is a complex character burdened by his past and he stays with you after the movie has ended. There are great Zen sayings uttered by both Oogway and Shifu and I loved the way an animation movie was used to portray serious thought. My only grouse was that the climax fight between Leng and Po was a bit short. However, overall this was a very satisfying watch. 3.5 out of 5.",1

287,9.0,"Against the background of many other (especially recent) foreign cartoons, Kung Fu Panda looks very successful. An interesting idea, of which, in principle, there are many, is very well implemented - but this is already a rarity in the mass flow of cartoons stamped by the American film industry. The protagonist - a clumsy, ridiculous Panda, dreams of becoming a kung fu master - and fate gives him such an opportunity. The result is obvious, but that's not the point. The very path of becoming a great master is a separate story, causing either laughter or sympathy. The authors did not overdo it with moralizing, successfully turning it into ancient Chinese wisdom. In the end, everything looks very tasty. And the drawn cartoon fights are a separate fat plus in the common piggy bank. In addition to beautifully drawn graphics, they give off an old-school quality that only a person who grew up on films with Jackie Chan can understand. The fleur of the story itself is present in this and makes the picture even more interesting and enjoyable to watch. And most importantly - in the cartoon there is humor. I don't know whose merit is in this - the authors or our localizers - but there are jokes, there are a lot of them, and they are generally very successful and funny. What does it mean? This means that it is high time to take it and watch a wonderful cartoon.",1

The fact of the matter is that the entire movie should be treated as one giant jab at old, super-cheesy Kung-Fu movies. However, rather than flatly lampooning it, what we wind up with is a deconstructionist approach to the genre.

What I found fascinating was the film's uneasy connection to body image. On the one hand, there are plenty of fat jokes and appetite jokes directed at Po. But something unexpected happens when Master Shifu (sp. ?), the red panda tasked with training him, experiments with his technique: he discovers that when Po applies his love of eating to his moves, he thrives, even in unconventional ways.

Otherwise, this movie was certainly worth passing, unless you have children that are entertained by just about anything animated. Jack Black is typically very funny to me, and this character even suited his voice, yet still the silly and mundane story line just wasn't enough to keep my attention. You will enjoy a few laughs here and there, but in the end I think it is likely you will feel relatively dissatisfied altogether.",0
307,7.0,This is Dreamworks best movie to date. Dreamworks still can't measure up to quality of Pixar. As always i always dread seeing 3D animated movies. But this came out on 2nd place as the best animated movie of the year. The first is Wall-E.,1
308,7.0,"Dreamworks Animation has it very tough now a days, living forever in the shadow of Pixar. But it's been hard to feel sorry for them. In the seven years after the smash success of the movie ""Shrek"", they've only managed to churn out one mediocre and simplistic animated film after the other, set apart only by their top celebrity voices, and laden with kids only humor and tired pop-culture jokes. They haven't been bad per say, but when the competition is the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, you start to wish they'd try a little harder. Now along comes Kung Fu Panda, easily the best CGI kids film the studio has come up with. It's nothing spectacular, but it's great fun, and probably the most fun a family can have together at the movies this summer...in a movie without trash cleaning robots.",1
309,10.0,"I just got back from ""Kung Fu Panda"" and it was simply Awesome or as Jack Black would say ""AWESOMENESS"". Now I went in there as a Jack Black fan expecting a great film and it was. If you have kids then bring them to this movie, because there are jokes, and cracks that appeal to all ages. also listen to the cricket because there's a part in the movie where people didn't listen and it was HILARIOUS! If there was one thing I would change about this movie I would have more story build up on the enemy. He could have been meaner but till it was hilarious and i recommend it to all audiences. Defiantly 10 stars out of 10. I hope there is a sequel to this movie because it really deserves one.",1
310,9.0,"Lets give a small background of me as a commenter. I'm 19, movie lover, and haven't recently liked any 3D movies unless made by Pixar. I saw this with my mom, who badly wanted to see it (she's a 5 year at heart). I REALLY REALLY REALLY didn't want to see this at all. I was never planning on seeing it after all the recent failure 3D movies I had seen by Dreamworks or Disney (non-Pixar). I loved Shrek though and everything by dreamworks after that excluding Shrek 2 was a waste. It wasn't until reading all the wonderful comments by others who've seen this movie, I was turned around and decided to see it. ",0

The result at the end turns out not too bad, it uses Hollywood clichés in a pretty clever way, and even though some of the fight scenes don't work, it still is pretty good, though kind of boring. DreamWorks tries to regain the magic for the film that it had for Shrek but doesn't reach up to standards despite that their 7 years apart.",0

Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper).

Some are better, some are worse but for me it usually feels like watching the same formula again and again, only this time with a panda/robot/fish/ant/crap protagonist. I would skip Kung-Fu Panda easily, but whad'ya know, the ""making of"" was rather interesting, which made me ignore my tingling spider-sense and giving it a try. Truth be told - the movie looks very good (as expected), and I'm a sucker for these marvelous 2d animation eye-candies which seems to be popping around in those 3d movies. And so the animation is great, the character design is inspiring and everything Appears to be working out well. Well - too bad looks ain't enough in order to make a movie. it might suffice for a screen saver, a poster or even a rather interesting ""making of"", but that's as far as it goes. Sadly most of the plot is rather dull, same old jokes, same all goofy animal who just doesn't seem to find its place, but hey, polls and statistics claims that about 50% of western children are overweight to obese. Most of them have broken dreams of becoming things they can never be, so why not selling them the illusion that any fat loser can be the ""Supreme Dragon Fighter""? Pack a few lame jokes along the way, and you're good to go. Usually in similar films when the clueless loser is supposed to undergo a path that will make him the ultimate hero, he either practices and improves or finds out about some ""magic quality"" he had within himself all along. In this movie, the makers of the movie didn't bother themselves to make a choice, so the Panda hero easily shifts between the options, not really qualifying for any of them. He gets better and seems to know stuff even though he had almost no time to practice, and when that doesn't suffice he suddenly turns into ""fat people don't get hurt, only bounce your attacks back with their fat"" mode. Such behavior could have been tolerated farther if the jokes or the plot would cover up for it, but they don't.",0
323,9.0,Kung Fu Panda is one of the animated films that defined the late 2000s outside of the Disney supergiant. It has an artistically creative opening that has a style that continues in later scenes. Jack Black is the supreme choice to play a fat panda and he does it. As a character Po is a great one track panda that brings humor to the table through his personality and through physical gags. The lesson of the film is kind of shoved in your face by the end and the characters definitely have very obvious character development. This plays to the target audience though so it is alright. The reason this movie is so great is purely because it is one of the most well-made and pure in nature animated films.,1

The movie was hilarious from the start, and kept it up throughout a large part of the movie. But the parts that weren't funny were what sets this movie apart from many others. It didn't rely on cheap laughs and one liners for the whole movie, (and barely at all for that matter) it had some some truly dramatic moments. And the directors knew when the right time was to leave the humour out of those moments. None of the jokes seemed thrown in for cheap laughs. They were all done at the right times and were really funny. It sort of had the feel of some of the Disney movies of the not so distant past, like Aladdin and The Lion King. The movie had me cracking up, and I'm the kind of person who tends not to laugh at much at the cinema, even if I find it funny. So I guess that covers how awesomely funny the movie is.",0

One day, the kung fu school hosts the choosing of a new ""Dragon Warrior"" who will join the current all-star team of kung fu masters, ""The Furious Five,"" and defeat the impending threat of Tai Lung. Much to the surprise of everyone, the head of the kung fu school, Master Oogway, chooses Po. No one is more surprised than Dustin Hoffman's voiced ""Shifu"" who cannot imagine such a figure becoming a warrior. Po, voiced by Jack Black with an childlike innocence and boundless enthusiasm, struggles through training, but eventually him and Shifu make some breakthroughs and Po defeats the villainous Tai Lung before the end. While I don't quite like the, ""Just be confident in yourself"" messaging of the film, I love pretty much everything else about the film. The kung fu setting here is not just a gimmick, this film exudes a love and understanding of what makes the genre so special. The audience gets to experience through Po's eyes the basic joy of the good vs evil kung fu setup, the creative training sequences, cool weapons and moves, the pop philosophies, and the dance-like choreography of its best action sequences. The animators went out of their way here to honor the genre in a beautiful art style, character designs, and thoughtful action sequences that are some of the best in their genre. Po's fantastic, funny, and charming, but it is Dustin Hoffman's Shifu that I think most of the adults watching the film connect with. His arc of going from a strict taskmaster broken from a formerly failed student to someone widening his moral imagination to see someone like Po as worthy of grace, love, and training.

I can move on from it, but it still matters. There is no ""reset button"". And the future is a mystery only if you have no rudder and no motor.

And it is for the first ten minutes in which we are first introduced to our hero  the Po (voiced by a hilarious, show-stealing Jack Black.) Po is an under-achieving fat, ravenous, panda born the son of a slightly mad noodle seller (voiced by James Hong) who dreams of being a famous kung fu master. His heroes have always been the amazing furious five  Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie,) Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan,) Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen,) Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voiced by David Cross) trained by the greatest kung fu teacher in all China, Master Shifu (voiced by the magical Dustin Hoffman.)

339,10.0,"Talk about a movie that takes the cinema world by storm. A movie that is not only outstanding but masterful in making Kung Fu look awesome and respects it. A movie where the people of DreamWorks can look back and be proud of this achievement. This is DreamWork's first big hit critically and financially since Shrek 2 in 2004. Kung Fu Panda is made in 2008 with a major comeback from last year's Shrek the Third. But now what do I love about the film? Firstly they touch on the most important elements that make an animated film great or good. That is: Story, Animation, Music and Characters. All are done wonderfully. The story is creative, heartfelt, funny, and action packed. On the side note I do love that they use 2d animation for the opening sequence which is an artistic wonder to see. They actually give it an anime type feel. Then we get to my favorite part of the film: the characters. It's been a while since I've seen a group of character I actually enjoy not being just one. My favorite character out of all of them is not Po even though he is hilarious. That prize goes to Tigress. Right when I first see her I get this feeling of pain and sort of feel sorry for her considering what we learn about her in the film. I really hope they go into more detail about her as the franchise goes on. She's the most interesting and mysterious of the character because judging by the way she is makes me think that she must have gone through a lot in her life that just hasn't been reveled yet. The rest of the character are good themselves. I like Shifu because they don't do the typical wise old master of martial arts. But he actually always seems unsure and rough around the edges. As for Po who is perfectly voiced by Jack Black is the most unique hero since Mulan. He makes me laugh more then any other character. As a whole this film is without a doubt a classic that should be acknowledged by every generation. Story: A Characters: A Animation: A Music: B+ Overall: A",1

My only criticism is that, considering the stunning array of huge stars doing voices, so many of them got so few lines. I mean, it's a Kung Fu movie, and Jackie Chan gets only a handful of lines. WHAT?!? But this movie really drew me in. It'll be a great movie for kids and families, but if you're an adult go to a late show and you will love it. I was pleasantly surprised.

For starters an issue with this film is Jack Black. Granted he isn't that bad in this and it is his voice that is doing the work and not his acting, but his voice is so distinct that I couldn't help but imagine that it was actually him on the screen, especially when the part he is playing is an overweight, cartoon panda. Far to life like for me. Other voice members of this team remain hidden, Hoffman is brilliant as Master Shifu and his voice becomes lost in the character, also Ian McShane as Tai Lung the deadly snow leopard is deep and menacing. The same can't be said for all the other voice cast which includes such stars as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui and David Cross. All seem to get about ten lines each. Perhaps this isn't a problem with the voices but the character as they are so hard to connect with. Five animals, a tigress, crane, monkey, mantis and viper, all kicking ass but saying nothing, yep I can see why we can't connect with them.

Others have written down the story, so I won't do so, I someone would not know, one can read it from there. First of all I don't get it why is it a must to use big-time Hollywood actors as voices for characters? Voice acting is acting too, I know, but surely others could of been used as well. I just don't believe in a movie promotion campaign where the strategy is based on the voice-actors, not on the movie itself. Onwards, why do the animated figures have to look like the people giving voices to them? Couldn't the snake be less-lu-like and the opossum less-Hoffman-like? This going to all the characters. Further more, I don't get why were there five big kung fu masters (appart from the trivial reason, that there - as it seems - are five styles named after them)? There just is no reason for it in the movie, no characters are drawn, all are totally dissed. It would of been enough to make two others and the movie would of worked just fine. In this case the two others would of gotten more character and charisma; a bit of more personality. Currently the ape, the insect and the legless-lizard are totally unnecessary.",0

This movie talks about a looser and how he beats all odds and becomes a winner by the strength of his will.

353,7.0,"The hard-headed folks at Dreamworks just won't back down when it comes to their consistent choice to produce only the animated genre of slapstick comedy despite constant unnecessary comparisons to Pixar by most audiences. Here however, I feel they've finally succeeded in forming a well-crafted comedy that references itself and its genre without any manipulative occurrences of incessant cute (despite featuring one of the universal symbols) or thin framework. One of the first cgi Dreamworks romps to lack pop culture (shockingly less than Pixar's Cars) the pacing in the film shines, as well as the slick camera work and surprisingly effective fight sequences. Particularly, there was a true sense of environment to the animation, but also a sense of peril and physical boundaries in the well choreographed combat scenes. The story is expectedly predictable as well as the clean message, but the film comes together as referential fun comedy with likable and moderately inspiring situations despite the nature of the film. There are no mean-spirited jokes, and just the right amount of heart are out into them (not too much or little) so that it begins to approach what made the first Shrek enjoyable. It makes great use of its animation, tying in it's comical pacing with a lot of great physicality. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations, barely noticing or caring that they typically come to us from cherry-picked A-list celebs in an attempt to drag in theatregoers. Despite that, they bring their A-game with voice work, and the audience besides the actors have fun for once. In my opinion, it's one of Dreamworks' best after they canned their 2d films.

The atmosphere is pitch perfect, hyper real, and beautiful as a cherry blossom. Fighting sequences are flawlessly choreographed, and characters are hilarious and make expressions so subtle they deserve academy awards. Only one thing mars all this. THE MOVIE ISN'T ABOUT ANYTHING. If you don't believe me, wait till the plot-twist at the end that states the moral aloud, and crazily enough is that the secret to success is NOTHING. If you believe in something enough it apparently comes true...in the magical fantasy world of Kung Fu Panda. This moral idea of a person being able to will themselves to greatness is not only dangerous applied to real life (I can fly!) but the movie contradicts the message itself, by making the villain evil because he is selfish and a killer. Apparently it's bad when the snow leopard 'believes in himself' enough to fight for what's his, but if the Panda does it it gives him mystical powers. Also, the Panda is implied to have KILLED the leopard at the end, using the very power taught to him by the leopard's surrogate father. Good lesson there, eh? Skadoosh. As very pretty screen-savers go, this film is at least better written then Clone Wars, but equally devoid of likable characters and substance. Much like I'd recommend Clone Wars to people who love awesome battles and technical wizardry but can afford to sit through something inherently empty, if you like to watch top notch CG, some great pratfalls, and kung fu fighting animals and you can stand no character development, moral, rhyme or reason, watch Kung Fu Panda once.

(I loved Martial Arts movies), and from the long years I saw them in real action pace I wondered how exhilarating would it be in 3D (I saw enough in 2D). Unthinkably and funnily it materialized through Dreamworks. Their sincerity and wit mixed in the story made it a modern-classic novelty success. I must say the cast are also brilliant (especially Jack Black). Jack Black's humor got well into the character of Po. The rest are humorously awesome. You'll even forget their playing the one! I mean, I didn't realize for a moment that Monkey was Jackie Chan, and Viper was Lucy Liu. Even Dustin Hoffman's voice as far as I remember (well, most recently I was fond of a lot of his old films!) is unrecognizable. One may think the story excites only kids but it caters anyone who finds entertainment open in their heart. I remember watching ""A Bug's Life"". I've seen it in VHS for almost five times and still didn't get tired of its simple but enticing story. Although it may seem thinly inviting in cover, I assure you its action and play is superbly enough.",1
359,9.0,"Aim High, Fly high The movie 'Kung Fu Panda' is a great movie. It was one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen. It is an animation about Kung Fu, but made by America. I am just curious about why Americans are interested in Kung Fu so much. Instead of Taekwondo which is Korea's. But this movie is the one of my favorite movies. I can't take my eyes off it from the beginning until the end because it is very unique, cute, interesting and creative movie.",1
360,9.0,"I highly recommend the film Kung Fu Panda. I have to admit that I assumed that this movie was advertised to kids between the ages of five and ten because of the animation. I only watched this film because it was a class assignment but I actually enjoyed it. The film is short and made for all ages. In the film, Kung Fu Panda, Po, the main character, is an overweight panda that secretly dreams of one day being very good at kung fu. In actuality, he is the son of a goose, Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong), a noodle restaurant owner. Po literally drops in on a ceremony where the elderly Master Oogway, a tortoise (voiced by Randall Duck Kim) is selecting the next Dragon Warrior who will defeat the escaped villain, Tai Ling, (voiced by Ian McShane). Po is ""accidentally"" selected to be this savior even though he was not an invited party to this ceremony. During these beginning scenes, if you do not pay close attention you will surely fail to notice Po as he lands smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. I really enjoyed this movie laughing at all of Po's antics as he makes his way to the Grand Warrior ceremony.",1
361,9.0,"This is a hilarious slapstick, martial art movie. This movie has good characters and good animation. Jack black does a tremendous job. And so did the other people, even Seth Roegen.",1
362,10.0,"I went into this movie with very low expectations after reading some of the other reviews. I was shocked when at the end of the movie I had laughed so hard my sides hurt, and was blown away by the kung fu. All of the talent was spectacular. I wish Jackie Chan had a few more lines. I even teared up when the turtle died. This movie did exactly what a movie is supposed to do. It kept me entertained until the very end. I was even a little disappointed that there wasn't more.",0
363,9.0,"What I love about the movie is the beautiful scenes, music, soundtrack and funny lines. All these make this movie awesome.I strongly recommend you go watch it with your family. It will bring you a lot of fun. The story is quite easy,but I think that's supposed to be that way. The Kung Fu action in the movie is awesome too. Ofcouse Jack Black and Dustin did a great job too. I watched some other movies which had Chinese cultures in there, I didn't like them well. But this time, seems they did so well to show the real side of the culture, not just build them in. I watched Kung Fu Panda with my husband. He loved it too. He is a very picky guy, he even said it is a great movie to watch. There were a lot children in the theater, I could feel they had a great time in there. I even saw a little girl watching it and taking pictures with a camera. I guess it might be her second time to watch it.",1
364,9.0,"Kung Fu Panda will leave you and your family smiling as you recall Po the pudgy panda's struggle to believe in his own strength and follow his heart. Jack Black lends his voice to Po: Kung Fu's biggest fan. We can laugh with his earnest attempts to become a Kung Fu master despite his apparent lack of physical strength or agility. It isn't until an accident (or fate) unexpectedly lands Po in the role of the revered Dragon Warrior that he must truly learn to trust in his own worth and save his new friends and family from the vicious and vengeful snow leopard, Tai-Lung (Ian McShane). I am a preschool teacher and a huge fan of animated films. This film was one of the few that I enjoyed in 2008. Director John Stevenson out did himself. Revolutionary animation techniques even allowed for both clothing and fur on each of the animals, something that is generally not done at the same time in a film. Slow motion fight scenes and intense action sequences will keep even the most energetic little boys enthralled. Young girls will feel empowered as Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu lend their voices to the female Kung Fu masters of the film, proving that martial arts are by no means for boys alone.",1
365,7.0,"Despite being a comedy-like film more suited for a younger audience I feel like anyone can watch this and still enjoy it. I love the emotional aspects of the film that any audience member (whether you're a child, teen, adult, elder) can relate to. I'm not an expert on martial arts so I don't know if what's being portrayed is 100% accurrate, but what I will say is that it looks real and it's amazing how they've animated it. Also, I like how they haven't feminised the female characters like some other stories do, for example they could have made tigress more lean/shorter/etc but they let her be a tiger. I also love how each species display their own species-specific behaviour too.",1
366,10.0,"Well, Dreamworks has finally done it. Though, they have made some wonderful and boldly different animated films such as the under rated Ants, Shrek, and Monster House, this is the crowning glory. They have made a cgi animated movie that has made me rolled with laughter, cry, and doing both at the same time. But what is magnificent about this film is the perfect balance of comedy timing, drama and some of the most exhilarating actions scenes that I have seen in any kind of animation. The CGI animation is astounding. And I'm not just talking about the detail of seeing hairs on a panda, or the breath taking backdrop of ancient China. I am talking also of the subtleties of the characters expressions and performance. There are numerous references to popular movies of the past but do not let that deter you as these references are integral to the story and not just there as a wink wink nudge nudge effect. The icing on the cake though is the voice casting. Jack Black's comic timing is well, awesome! He is the star. He is the lovable but clumsy big fat panda called Po, a nerdy fan of kung fu history who idolises the famous 5 kung fu warriors. He is inadvertently and very questionably marked as the chosen one who is prophesied to defeat an evil villain much to the bewilderment of everyone. The master charged with the seemingly impossible duty of shaping Po into a kung fu fighter is delightfully voiced by the great Dustin Hoffman. There are of course many more delightful characters but it is these two that carry the film. And a note to all martial arts fans (and yeah, all you old school Shaw Bros fans included), this movie is as close as you can get to animated martial arts paradise. But this is a movie for everyone. As the main character, Po would say. This movie truly awesome.",1

369,10.0,"The reason why I saw this film in the very first place is because it relates to the Chinese culture and Chinese features, especially, Chinese Kungfu. Though a Chinese I am, I am not a big fan of Chinese Kungfu and quite indifferent about the animated film. But, after I finished the Kungfu Panda, I was indeed carried away to the ancient China by the film which unravels the 100 percent pure Chinese culture and features- Chinese Kungfu of course, Chinese Zen culture from the words of Master Wugui(turtle), Chinese settings( pine trees, high mountains, temples, music and garments as well), and, hilariously, a few Chinese words( Chi-eat, Wugui-turtle, Shifu-master, just to name a few).

372,10.0,"For a long time, I was hesitant to watch this movie. I feared that with it being an animation movie, it would make fun of the kung fu tradition and the oriental culture in general for the sake of comedy and jokes, which, to me, would have been such cheap comedy. Was I wrong!! I finally gave in and watched it, and I LOVED every bit of it. The characters are drawn in such an amazing fashion and very well balanced, especially Po, he is childish and a little immature but in an adorable way that you still have to like him.",1
373,6.0,"good animated movie for the kids but if you're not a fan of animated movies, of course this movie is not for you. this movie alone is not worth the money. voices are great, although i'm a bit tired of hearing Jack Black's voice. it gets quite irritating.",1
374,10.0,"No, this is not an exaggeration. I have seen this movie probably around 10 times and I still can't get enough of it.

379,9.0,"I don't think its often you see a movie that can deliver a belly full of laughter as well as moments of poignancy but The Panda film is one of them. It was a joy to sample this film full of sparkling entertainment more because of the refreshing balance that it delivered between adult humour and kids humour than anything else. Detractors and critics will point to the quite complete and singular focus on Jack Black's character and perhaps the jocular mentality towards obesity. However I think it fairly charmless to attack the credibility of an animated adventure comedy on the basis of politically incorrect humour, after all comedy has to live on the border of good taste. As for Jack Black his performance is everything we would expect of an expert comedian - and in particular some awards have to go to the effects team for getting the facial expressions of the creature so accurate and human-like.",1
380,9.0,"Without a doubt this is the absolute entertainment movie of the year. DreamWork has already created history with the release of this film & with its progressive & creative brilliant output its certainly becoming a big challenge for Disney- Pixar. The movie is full of entertainment package bundled with fun plus action animation. 100% entertainment, superb animation graphics (DreamWork is improving here by leaps & bounds) & incredible & touchy characters is all guaranteed in this film. It's definitely tough fight for Wall E in next Oscar. Well its story of an ordinary fat giant Panda named Po (one of the most lovely character launch of this year) who is daydreaming about being dragon warrior. To fulfill his dream he has to convert all his minus into plus & how he does that impossible possible with the help of mentor Shifu & 5 fighters is a thing to watch. The voice over is also nicely done with wonderful actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen & the master of Kung Fu  Jackie Chan. What to say about cute & touchy Po!!! Animation has grasps every emotional expression of his ups & down. I mean this is the only animation character which I would like to compete with my all time favorite- Cub Simba (The Lion King). Similarly the character of old Oogway & Shifu is also something amazing about the film. I'm desperately looking forward for its next part. Panda Po rocks & Kung Fu too.",1
381,8.0,"How I loved Kung Fu Panda! Po is very well introduced in the first few minutes, the development of his path is very exciting and his student-teacher relationship with Master Shifu is spectacular. We also have a great villain that is to be feared and with an interesting background as Tai Lung and the design of the world where the story takes place I liked too much with those very vivid colours.",1
382,10.0,"I thought Kung Fu Panda was going to be a good movie, but nothing more than that, though. I have to say, I was in for a real treat! The animation is superb, starting from the stylized dream and credit sequence, to the CGI. But all those special effects weren't window dressing. The storyline is strong, and within it, a good message that you can do anything if you can put your mind (and body) to it when you can! ",1
383,7.0,"It's probably one of my favorites in the DreamWorks catalog, definitely one of their best. It's an all around well made movie, with a good message to boot. Hopefully they can make more good films like this.",1
384,8.0,"In shortit's awesome. Kung Fu Panda is the best CGI-animation movie since The Incredibles. Clever writing, gorgeous animation, fun action, and stellar vocal work by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, and(drumroll please)Jackie Chan! The latter lends a feel of authenticity to this kung-fu themed flick, but you don't have to be a martial arts aficionado to enjoy the ride. Like The Incredibles, this works on multiple levels: kids movie, adult comedy, fantasy, and action movie. Jack Black is immensely likable and Dustin Hoffman charms. There's even some decent morality and philosophy going on. And it'll make you laugh. What more do you want? **** (out of five).",1
385,10.0,"Well every time i see this movie i always laugh and hold my seat for the next scene. Dreamworks out did themselves with this movie because of the fact of the learning curve we all have to go through. Po being a non kung fu student dreams of being the best fighter in the valley, yet his simple look to the art is childish not realizing what learning this art entails. And having to grow up just a little bit faster in the face of danger lurking around the corner from the most rageful student shifu had to train. Po suddenly realizes that being the dragon warrior is being the savior to the valley and to his father and his friends. This film gave us every kind of ingredient that all people face each day in order to over come the obstacles. And Po trained awesomely with shifu, learning the skills that a panda bear only can master, and becoming the warrior that oogway foretold. The team that gave us Kung Fu Panda was awesome, showing kids that growing up and learning new things to keep people safe from danger is the only positive message that this film can provide. And also trying to learn how to make good noodles.",1

It is funny, it looks great, and it is a surprisingly well-written film. Tons of great quotes and the story is great. Overall great movie. The main character is so relatable, everybody says I'm fat but they don't know that I am actually super cool and I can kick everybody's ass if I want to.",1
388,8.0,"Ever since Shrek, I always loved Dreamworks Animation Films and I had no doubt that this film is going to follow the tradition and it darn right did! I found the film to be very fun, entertaining and not to mention hilarious! Jack Black did an awesome job as Po! Very funny panda but the funniest is Master Shifu like at the end when Po thought Shifu was dead he said ""Shifu please, don't die!"" and then suddenly Shifu wakes up and says ""IM NOT DYING YOU IDIOT!"" That was classic! Funniest part in the movie! But even though I'm a purple belt at karate I could never compete with Shifu or the bad guy Tai Lung! But thinking Po defeated Tai I could probably take a shot at him! Overall a very funny and entertaining summer blockbuster. Highly recommend. You'll love it! ",1

It's their best effort since the original Shrek, mainly because more attention is given to the story and characters.

What is good about this movie? actions? music? cliché words? special effects? the crane's meticulous feather? You can find them in any other animations. Probably this one could have been called good if it had been made thirty years ago. This is simply one of those products from Hollywood's product line. The director tried to make it special by putting a panda as the hero. Yet that makes no difference. The panda and his father and his teacher and his colleague and his neighbors, they are just as same as those character you can find in every other dreamwork's stuff. Sorry. The first one they made was glorious, the second one was a movie, the third one was just a piece of junk. This would be a sign of the end of road if their films went on like this. Or a culture bomb to make people idiots.",0

Brilliant voice talents from Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Lucy Liu, Eddie Izzard and many, many more. If you are in the mood for a film with a great storyline and some very funny jokes (to be honest the panda is just funny every time) go to the movies and buy yourself one ticket to see ""Kung Fu Panda"" because you'll not regret it. If you loved ""Findind Nemo"" or ""Madagascar"" you'll love this movie!",1
400,8.0,"'Kung Fu Panda' is an absolute delight! A comic underdog story that satisfies on pretty much every level, its a film that is not only a riot for kids but a joy for adults as well. Our protagonist is Po - a big, cuddly Panda living with his surrogate father in China & working as a noodle maker/server in the Valley of Peace. This, however, is clearly not where he belongs as the big guy dreams of becoming the ultimate master of kung fu...only he has no plan or physical attributes for the same. Opportunity knocks when Po is picked by the sage-like master of the kung fu temple as the chosen one to face the evil Tai Lung. All manners of hilarity ensue as Po is put through the wringer by his trainer Shifu (the excellent Dustin Hoffman). Featuring an elaborate & spectacular prison-break sequence where the fearsome Tai Lung escapes, 'Kung Fu Panda' consistently regales with stunning artwork & detailing. The colour palette used is striking indeed and every character is imbibed with lifelike ticks and mannerisms. The voice-over work is superb. Jack Black as Po and Ian McShane as Tai Lung are particular stand outs. A family film to be enjoyed & treasured, 'Kung Fu Panda' is no.3 in my hierarchy of animated features - after 'Shrek 2' & 'The Lion King'.",1

The visuals are stunning, with landscapes, backdrops, and object design superb, and character design which suits the setting whilst also adding a great deal to the characters themselves, while the 2D segments are equally beautiful whilst adding variety to the tone of the story. The story is straightforward, but manages to be dramatic and moving without resorting to melodrama, and is above all enormously entertaining. The humour, too, is pretty simple - juvenile, in many cases - but it never fails to make me laugh. A rollicking good ride.",1
404,2.0,"I hate the idea behind this movie, which is that it doesn't matter how hard you work or train; its all about fate and destiny. You can be a mediocre but if you are the chosen one, don't worry, you will not only surpass everybody else but you will be the best. Tell this to every athlete and see what his response will be. Our kids should learn that to make a difference in sports, you must work hard, train hard, eat well. You will not win a medal just because you horoscope says so. In the movie, although the hero trains and works at last, it will not match the years and whole life dedication of training that other members of the team have.

In the scene, when Po tries to get into the Jade Palace and sees who the dragon warrior is, that scene is totally funny.

417,10.0,where do i start from-the cgi wasn't that great but that wasn't supposed to be this film's strength.its secret ingredient(lol)is of course its great lines.generally a movie would contain two or three such lines-this one is overflowing with it.the facial expressions were done marvelously and the voice over was brilliant especially for po.the greatest achievement of this film is that it will be remembered as the best animation film out of the Disney-pixar stable.but the reason i write this review is not for the movie-a lot has been written about it already.i have a question for all-why is it that ladies aged 45+ consistently give the lowest rating for any movie irrespective of the genre or period?most movies in the IMDb list of best movies lose their points because of these old women who for some reason refuse to give top rating points to even the best of movies.god knows what kinda movies these ladies prefer.,1

419,10.0,"A wonderful movie. Great story for adults and children. Captivating characters. Remarkable songs. Breathtaking ending. Movie watched on April 6, 2022.",1
420,10.0,"Where to start... This movie has so much going for it, and everything works perfectly. First, the music. John Powell and Hans Zimmer make an amazing soundtrack, with Hero being epic, Oogway Ascends being beautiful, and plenty of great motifs that end up getting used throughout the franchise like the Dragon Warrior theme. Possibly the most memorable animated movie soundtrack ever besides maybe How to Train Your Dragon (funnily enough, also John Powell) or The Lion King (funnily enough, also Hans Zimmer). Second, the animation. Besides just being great animation, DreamWorks creates an incredibly detailed world with fantastic scenery. It also uses a blend of 3D animation and a stylized cartoon sequence at the beginning. Third, the humor. Thanks to an amazing all-star cast, Kung Fu Panda is hilarious. Jack Black as Po, in particular, is perfect. The animation helps with that too, giving Po hilarious facial expressions. Fourth, the action. The final fight, the bridge fight, the prison sequence, the training, the opening sequence...it's all great. The variety and use of scenery is top-notch, to the point where this would be just as good of an action movie as it is an animated movie. Fifth, the writing. Not only does this movie have incredible dialogue and quotes (Oogway's ""present"" comment is one of the best movie quotes ever), but there is such good planning present. Mr. Ping's hesitation when Po mentions his heritage and a scene where Shifu is struggling to achieve inner peace are both perfectly planted setups for the sequel, which makes the sequel feel natural and in no way forced. Sixth, the characters. Partially thanks to them all being different animals, the characters are so memorable and unique. They all get their own personalities and fighting styles, and it works so well. Tai Lung is an amazing villain, too, a perfect combination of scary and understandable. Seventh, the messaging. I saved the best for last. Kung Fu Panda is a heartwarming and inspiring story about Po going from a nobody to a Dragon Warrior, but within that amazing story lie so many life lessons that I can't believe DreamWorks pulled it off. The movie focuses on the importance of perseverance and hard work. Po has no right being anywhere near the Furious Five, but he works so hard and never gives up. A true warrior never quits, as he says. It also focuses on how you should accept what you can't change and focus on being the best you that you can be, finding and honing your strengths and using them to your advantage...finding what makes you special and capitalizing on it. Then there's the ending message, which I won't spoil, that does ""believe in yourself"" better than any other movie. Overall, this movie has it all. It's funny, action-packed, heartwarming, and important for kids and adults alike. Between this and How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks has some incredible masterpieces.",1

The jokes were funny and cute, the dilemmas were touching and sad, and ending was only a little bit corny. The violence was overboard and cartoonish (sort of like bugs bunny back in the day--sure, someone is going to be shot by a shotgun, but no lasting effects if you're the good guy). So, it's okay for the kids, i felt. ",1

424,8.0,"I have just seen the film today. It is quite interesting, but not totally amazing. It is very well balanced in the whole film with those little lovely jokes. But some of them are kind of familiar. The character building is kind of OK to the main roles, but fortunately, the nice action scenes help the supporting roles to be remembered also. It is just an animation, so it should not be asked to have too many theories in it for people to figure out. Being entertaining is its ultimate mission. Fortunately, it totally fulfills its task! But still, as I said it is not totally amazing since I did not really get surprised when I saw this film like when I saw ""The Incredibles"". Maybe it is just caused by the different themes these two different films have. This film is quite interesting and entertaining. So if you would like to see a lovely Panda and his lovely friends doing martial arts, then don't miss this film!",1

Something this movie does well is having a sort of symbolism that kids and adults can understand and at different levels. This symbolism or moral is something that isn't just people over analyzing the movie but something that is present throughout the entire movie.

On the minus side, I'm still wondering about the merits of a movie in which the over-weight 'hero' is motivated by offering him food. First, I have a concern about, well, not only Hollywood's but society in general's tendency to make fun of fat people. I guess the filmmakers could argue that the panda is just over-weight to him an unlikely hero.. and then of course if he were to become slimmer to be accepted that's not cool either. But couldn't the panda just be fat and that's that? Couldn't he have been motivated by something other than more food? The bottom line is, the story is kinda OK but nothing special. My kids liked it but I was left wanting more.",1

I was too young to see through that to find a genius story, truly intriguing characters, honestly timeless comedy and the sendoff of one of the greatest trilogies of all time, not just for children but for everyone, all of which this movie has to affect. this sparked my love of movies.

432,9.0,"It's a movie that my family can watch over and over again. There is just so much comedy, action and values to be taken from this show. The overall standard of this movie is comparable to that of ""The Incredibles"". The character to look out for is Oogway (a direct Chinese phonic translation of 'turtle'). He did a few meaningful quotes from the movie - ""You are too concerned with what's was and what will be. There is a saying 'Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it's called the present.'"" That's the Power of Now!",1

First off, we are true animated film fans  there are very few  if any  that we have not seen. That said, KFP (Kung Fu Panda) was in the head of the class. This one graduates summa cum laude with movies like Shrek and Monsters, Inc. As a kid, we loved the karate films like: The Karate Kid - Parts 1 thru12 *LOL*, The Last Dragon, and of course, those endless karate film marathons on the television on Sundays. We couldn't wait to try out the latest ""crane technique"" on our brothers or sisters. You remember when. This one had us nostalgic for that same golden era. The artwork was amazing and crisp  you felt that the characters were people with all the human factors that endure. The acting was great and the comedic timing was spot on.

436,6.0,"It is a common thing these days that animated movies are not made just for kids, but also for adult audience as well. I have no reason to think that kids won't love this movie. Po is interesting character, somewhat funny, but unless you are 12 years old, this film just won't do the thing. Before I watched ""Kung Fu Panda"" I have read a lot of reviews full of superlatives, excitement and good words for this movie and to be honest, I have expected much, much more. The story is, just as I expected to be, nothing more than million times seen thing like ""there is a hero in each one of us, even the most average guys"". And to make things worse, writers didn't even try to add anything new. After 15 minutes of this movie, you can pretty much guess the rest of plot, without any errors. But the story is not the only flaw of this movie. It's not even funny. And it is supposed to be, it's animated movie after all. I have read some reviews saying the beginning is little boring, but later on, you will roll on the floor laughing and crying. Honestly, not only I haven't roll on the floor like promised, I have a feeling that I have spent an hour and thirty minutes waiting to see something spectacularly funny, but it never happened. There were few funny moments, but that's it! There was no magic, like in ""Wall-E"" or ""Shrek"", no laugh, no nothing, it looked painfully average to me, especially after big expectations I had. I think this movie is pretty much overrated.",0
437,8.0,"A fun and happy piece of storytelling by Dreamworks animation! As an avid fan of Hollywood cinema, one genre that I never quite dwelled into was animated comedies from big studios like Disney or Dreamworks. For so long I used to wonder, after looking at the box office reviews and collections of such movies, why were they such a popular hit with the audience. Kung Fu Panda has satisfied all my qualms with a very heartwarming performance. I was suggested this movie by someone very close to me and was asked to enjoy the smiles that it would bring along with the shade of learning that it will offer. Kung Fu Panda does all that and more... The choice of characters and their voice over personas is spot on. Jack Black delivers the dialogs of a desperate and lovable panda with delightful humor. The background animations and character designs are very cheerful and scenic despite being animated, and have been done very well to keep in sync with Chinese backdrop. Even the inclusion of 5 Kung Fu masters each depicting the original 5 shaolin fighting stances is a very apt homage to the core theme of the movie. The action sequences, I've read, were coordinated and animated with high degree or precision and realism and it shows throughout. The motivational theme centered of the Kung Fu masters, which is again a very pleasant tribute to the popular martial art movies, looks very believable especially in the phase where Po (the hearty kung-fu panda) is being motivated and trained despite being doubted by everyone. Dreamworks have managed to pull together a very original movie with the music, colors, and characters and story all working like a well-oiled machine. No wonder this movie has had such widespread reception and acclaim. After the success of ""Shrek"" series, Kung Fu Panda has been even better in terms of thematic animation from Dreamworks studios. The old mater portrayed by a tortoise is probably one of the best character selections. The slow motions of his animations and the fact that he is the most aged reflects on the knowledge that he delivers with his part in the movie. All it takes is believing in oneself and living in the present There are no accidents! :)",1

440,8.0,I like this movie much. Po (portrayed excellent by Jack Black) is so funny and the orher characters are very good. Oogway is a character with much depth and he is also very strange and Shifu is Borg funny and also have depth. Tai lung is a very good villain and the fighting scenes are very exciting. The furious five are ok. Tigress is good but the rest dosen't add much to the movie outside the fights. I like the relationship betweeen Po and his dad. The animations are top notch and very beautiful. You don't get dissapointed.,1

If there's any person who would say that this is their favourite movie, I would like to bonk them in the head. I did not laugh once at any of the lines. We get it, Po is fat, but the movie recycles that joke again and again and again. The animation is standard at best, it does not shine nor could it be considered beautiful. The villain is average, the plot is very archetypal and the action scenes are boring. I left the theatre stiff.

Through learning, training and finding out how to use his unique powers for the better, he manages to defeat Tai Lung and show that he is worthy of being the Dragon Warrior.

The panda looks like the panda is SUPPOSED to look, and he stands there and accepts the poking and prodding and ridicule that is heaped upon him and it made me sad to watch. If the Panda were female or if he were a caricature of a visible minority, jokes of the same ilk would be inexcusable, so how is this funny? I'm sick to death of this trite perpetuation of a stereotype that, at best, teaches children forget that there is a broad range of what is beautiful, or, indeed, what is healthy.'There is evidence that fat people who achieve cardiovascular fitness through exercise have better health outcomes than lean people who don't.' Many people are overweight. Many people think that being fit means being lean. We have to stand this idea on its head and film and TV would be a powerful way to get these ideas across to the burgeoning generation, instead, we perpetuate cruelty and a culture where eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, ranging between 5-15% for patients with anorexia and 1-2% for those with bulimia; where people with these eating disorders have the potential for imminent and serious self-harm (those with anorexia are 57 times more likely to commit suicide than the expected rate for women in the same age/racial groupings).

Its about a no good, fat and lazy Panda who by opportunity/destiny is chosen to be the dragon warrior. This is the funniest film you'll see this year. Tropic thunder might edge near but I really doubt it would be as funny. What exactly makes this animation so unique? It borrows basically the same concept as shrek only that it beats it hands down. Its originality really perplexed me, its been long since i""ve seen anything so unique. The graphics were also undoubtedly amazing. I could actually see a little bit of jack black in the panda. His expressions, his movement, everything was so jacky. And finally, the voice! oh my God, Jack really nails it here. I really hope there would be a part 2 to explain some of the unexplained aspects of the film.",1
449,7.0,"Now this is one film that that is philosophical, funny, entertaining and not just for kids but for all ages. No matter how predictable the story maybe, it still keeps you glued to your seat plus the moral ""there is no secret recipe"" makes you want to believe in your self , no matter how hopeless, obsessed or how much idealistic you are about anything. The movies is well targeted , keeping in mind that one is aiming for all age groups. There is animation for kids, there action for teenagers and there is a moral for the adults to impart to their young ones , who plan to sit beside them and watch it and also for the youth to realize that no mater what anyone says the only two things important are Focus and Perseverance. The animation is one of the best in recent times and the colors in the movie have been well chosen considering the whole ""china- look"" and the kung fu theme, these keep your eyes constantly on the screen. The humour is typical Jack Black -casual, silly and goofy which makes look like a one that has a hanger stuck inside. But one thing different about this film is that, on top of all this one really attaches himself to the characters which are all so varied. Again one of the most common things used in films is how characters of comics or fantasies are basically animals, this is done because nature itself is so varied and one can easily identify each one characteristics by the animal it is, Panda- fat hence perceived as lazy or slow, Tiger- Furious and Strong, Mantis - Small yet fast and clever , Snake- Focus, vigilance and reflexes and Monkey- Fast, flexible and active, relatively less furious. These characters take you on a journey filled with dreams ,aspirations and fun.",1

Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force.

I don't know how Dreamworks pulled together this cast with names like Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Jack Black, Seth Rogan, and Lucy Liou, but this was a brilliantly casted film.

The characters in interestingly outlined and you are given quite a few glimpses into the lives and struggles of the others.

The plot is simple but solid and has a wonderful moral that made me remember of those Disney's classics I used to love as a child.

Pretty much the whole movie it seems like he sucks at fighting, and he never really gets any better until near the end the fight with Tai Lung. Here we see that even Po is surprised when he suddenly starts fighting well. We can see Tai Lung's punches tickle Po, with this weird blue magic energy stuff. It seems like Po never even learned how to fight, but the dragon scroll, or his destiny, or something starts fighting for him, which left me a bit unsatisfied.

Reference to Asian culture (taoism) is good (the secret is there is no secret - there is no bad news - this is no accident - every day is a gift ...) How come people prefer wall-E to this movie. That's right, in Kung Fu Panda there is not this ""luv is stronger than anything else"" stuff - by the way only Wall-E is chasing the robot.

For this he is locked in a maximum security prison, and later killed by the kung fu panda. I don't recall him ever doing anything wrong enough to deserve being killed, even in a cartoon! In fact, they built him up as being so human, that we in the audience are sincerely hoping he will change his ways and turn over a new leaf at best, or at worst, maybe go back to prison. It's not fun to go to a movie expecting fun, laughter and comedy, and instead to find yourself leaving with your children, a little bewildered and feeling like the ending to the plot was unfair and poorly designed.

This really is one of the best children's film around along with all the others like Finding Nemo, Toy story, Monsters Inc etc. Some big named actors in this really brought the characters alive such as Jack Black as po the panda, Angelina Jolie as Tigris, Jackie Chan as Monkey.The whole concept of animals doing kung fu was genius that's what made the film so great. The plot was kept simple. The animation was top notch. Nothing really bad to say about his movie, cant see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it. A definite must see. ",1

It talk about fighting for a FAT PANDA (PO) to being in the Chinese best Kung Fu team. Really Ifluence me a lot",1
484,10.0,"I entered the theater not knowing what to expect, and received a first-rate, terrifying chiller. The pandas gave spectacular performances, and it would be a real shocker if one of them doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The only problem I had with this film was that the pandas showed an alarmingly large amount of nakedness which is not suitable for young viewers. (Would it have honestly killed Dreamworks to have put some clothes on those things? Anyway, the cinematography is astounding, the directing is crisp, and the pandas made every scene believable as heck. I hope one day in the near future I can meet the fine cast of pandas who delivered such amazing performances. My favorite part was when the main girl panda karate- chopped her mother's head off. First rate chills and thrills!!!",1

486,10.0,"When this movie came out in 2008, I had no desire to see this film. Even then I was 12 at the time and I just didn't have any interest me. Can you blame me? I mean the movie is about jack black as a Kung Fu fighting panda. However people loved it. It was getting great reviews. I just couldn't rap my head around something like that being good. I gave in and rented it when it came out in the prepubescent days of Redbox. Well my dad rented it :p. Ever since then I've watched this movie at least once a year or more. Great and unbelievably surprisingly movie. The main character Po is funny, kind, and overall great main character. The story is engaging and actually pretty serious. This is an overall comedy but it does well in mixing in dramatic scenes. For a movie called Kung Fu Panda there are some rather serious character arks. The animation is awesome, the characters are awesome, the whole movie is awesome. If I had one problem is that the villain is a little bland. He does have an insanely bad ass opening scene. If you haven't seen this movie, please ignore the fact that the movie is called Kung Fu Panda and see this excellent film for all ages.",1
487,10.0,"You really expect this movie to be a really stupid movie because of the title. But it's so far from that. This is one of Dreamworks' best movies besides HTTYD and Shrek. The animation is great. It's very funny. The fight scenes are really good. The musical score is amazing. The cast were perfect especially Jack Black as Po. And the story is really good too; Po trying to be like the Furious Five. I know it's kinda cliche but it feels fresh. And the villain Tai Lung is really good too. He's badass, menacing and has a compelling backstory. This movie's a must-see!!!!",1
488,9.0,"Honestly, I really don't like animation movies. I think it is so bored and it is not really funny. I don't know why exactly I watched Kung-fu Panda. When I watched it, I even couldn't hold my laughs. This film is about the story of Po who always dream to be a kungfu master. But, he is so pessimistic. It caused by his big body. Until one day, the miracle happened accidentally. He gets chance to be the kung-fu master who will fight against the bad kung-fu master, Tai Lung. For his first exercise, he failed. But, he is never tired and give up. Finally, he could defeated Tai Lung with the silly way. I think this story writer is so creative. This is the first animation movie that I love.",0

Alltho that it came from the same production house that gave us The Incredibles, I had no high hopes for a movie about a Kung Fu fighting Panda. But man was this movie a ride, it was funny, well performed by the actors lending their voices and wow Jack Black really outdid himself this time. I can sure say that he is real match up for Eddie Murphy as Donkey in the Shrek series. This movie is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone aging from 7 till 70 and even beyond coz it is just pure amusement and fun and most importantly very entertaining and never a minute boring. I had more fun watching this movie then I had watching Indiana jones 4, which imo is also great but this one is just that little extra better.",1

Jack Black was surprisingly good as the panda and seth rogan as mantis I didn't even realize but this movie actually is surprisingly good and funny. So go ahead and give it a try. by the way angelina jolie was the best thing about this movie she was amazing in it. but I thought you would also hear more jackie chan and monkey but hardley anything about them is present. but tailung was just kicking butt in the entire movie and was quite surprising about his child hood. and you will be surprised about the many other actors throughout the film.,1

The cast for the cartoon voices was Perfect, u could actually visualize Jack Black as a panda and Dustin Hoffman , Angeline jolie were both very successful too. The story line was perfect with the timing not too slow and not too fast , it keeps u gripped and laughing and sending u real life messages throughout the whole movie. At the end of the movie u feel great somehow with a huge smile on ur face. Panda is character that resembles a lot of how we see ourselves and the other ninja characters resemble how others accept and reject us by our appearance. Definitely a movie for all ages. A 10 plus from me !",1
498,8.0,"Kungfu Panda,cartoon movie. I always say to my friends I'll never want to watch anime movies either cartoon movies. I really don't like that kind of movie. But My sister had watched it,and she recommended me to watch it! And some day I wonder of the story,so I bought the theater tickets, I watched it with my cousin. Firstly, There is a Panda bear like child always like it!Which all the animals on that movie judge him as the one who lazy,underestimate him,big and fat,couldn't't do everything. He is kind and always receive bad comments from people around. He doesn't care on their comments. And some day there is Election of Leader in Dragon warrior. Everyone came there. His father worked as a noodle seller. Lot of problem came,He fought to get to the Dragon warrior. He made stupid mission to get there but accidentally it was helped him to be the kungfu master(as he always dream it to be) to fight with Tai Lung. Firstly he couldn't't do any of the kungfu, but his dream and will covered to be professional kungfu master with his own way which was sometimes silly. And the end he win to defeat Tai Lung. The story also tell us how to belief ourselves! Creative and meaningful story!",1

However, even in that version, I felt that this movie turned out to be excellent! Jack Black's portrayal of Po was awesome! (He gave him a very human quality and made us all relate to the underdog). All the characters were very unique and ""cute"". I felt that Richard Gere's character (what was his name again?? Not master... but...) was awesome!!! The animal actually resembled Richard Gere!! Anyway, I liked how this movie really converted Chinese kung fu culture into a movie! And I felt that it did it justice!! Anyway, this movie was great and I recommend it to everyone!!! Signing off... The movie that immediately comes to mind when reviewing this film is Kung Pow: The Legend of Fist, a comedy with Steve Oedekerk.",1
500,10.0,"Now, I'm not saying Dream Works hasn't made better movies. All I am saying is according to me, there can be no movie that can touch me deeper. I can go on and on about this movie and probably reach the max characters limit, but I'll keep it as short as possible.<br /><br />Why this is the best movie?<br /><br />1. A complete circle: All scenes are poetically repeated. I'll give few examples. Most of them are how Po used Shi fu's teachings to defeat Tai Lung (such as, 1. Po punches daruma doll and gets hit; same thing happens to Tai Lung when he punches Po, 2. using your enemies weakness against them: when Shi Fu is trying to get rid of Po, he beats him right and left and says the above dialogue then. Panda uses Tai Lung's tails( which is quite a cat's weakness) against him while fighting him.) Other examples include, how Shi Fu treated Tigress after Tai's broke his heart and how both Shi Fu and Po believed in their masters despite a vehemently opposing logical impossibilities stood before them.

508,7.0,"I had the opportunity to rewatch the first film from the Kung Fu Panda franchise recently. Watching this movie as a child and as a grown up can be a totally different experience each time. This movie lives up to the definition of a classic comedy/family genre film. This Oscar nominee film from DreamWorks animations is quiet famous for its pleasing mix of comedy, martial arts and its influence from eastern philosophies. Jack Black has done an exceptional job as giving voice to the protagonist (Po). This was a nice movie with likeable characters, although story and events seem quite simple and predictable for an older audience's point of view, its elegantly drawn scenes and animations makes it a visual treat for anyone who loves eastern culture, the action-packed scenes which are full of energy make this appealable even for older audience and on the other hand for the younger audience watching this would seem like acquiring a treasure. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a story that almost tells itself in in its title. Its hard to imagine a fat and fuzzy panda doing martial arts, the story of the film is exactly that it takes us through the journey how this panda who had all odds stacked against him achieve his dreams through pure determination and a mentality to never quit. After watching this movie multiple times, I have found that this movie had a perfect mix of comedy, martial arts and eastern philosophies as its inspiration. The comedy throughout the film does not stand out as extremely funny but at the same time there is a balanced interval between each comedy scenes which makes the whole film get a balanced humor throughout the plot making it appealable to watch without getting bored. The action sequences have also depicted a unique style in fighting when It comes to the fighting style of (Po) which makes it interesting and more acceptable to comprehend the animation work and art style that emphasizes the protagonist which makes the martial art in the film unique in its own way. The whole moviehas eastern culture written all over it, not only from the visual point of view but also throughout the plot one can experience the various shades of eastern philosophies that sets it apart from other comedy/family genre movies. Kung Fu Panda teaches us valuable life lessons about everything from martial arts to life itself. This can be best seen throughout the movie such as when (Grand Master Oogway) advices (Po) with his famous quote ""Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift. That is why it is called present."" Here the movie teaches us a valuable lesson inspired from the eastern culture of Buddhism which is we should accept the past and not fear the future and live in the present. There and many other examples such as how the character (Grand Master Oogway) acts as a source of knowledge and inspiration from multiple quotes which signifies the importance of fate and the eastern philosophies such as everything happens for a reason and there are no accidents. The movie also encourages us to dream and pursue new heights as how the protagonist overcomes his difficulties and moves forward. There is quiet a lot of hidden meanings spread across the plot of the movie that may seem different for each and every one. There are multiple scenes and events in this film that amused me such as how the word ""Shifu"" translates to master in Chinese and how the furious.five are inspired by five different forms of kung fu. Kung Fu Panda also foreshadows both of the upcoming sequels in its opening scenes. Another thing that usually older audiences might notice is that the films cast is stacked with prominent and well know actors from the main roles to the supporting roles. The end credits scenes resemble the art shadow puppetry of ancient China. Overall, throughout the movie one can experience a vast variety of eastern cultural visual treat. At a glance when you see from outside the movie seems to look like a simple and predictable and an average film but when you dig deeper you would see how much work has gone into each character and every aspect and style the animations and drawings are done. Almost every major scene in the movie has an influence from eastern philosophies that have multiple meanings and perspectives to understand the plot. This makes sure that everyone who watches this movie will have a unique pick for them. I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once in a lifetime as this a not only proven to be entertaining but also seems to be much more informative and educational when it comes to life. The deeper messages within the story tells us a lot about the real world. Parents can rest easy knowing that this movie contains numerous life lessons. So, watch this movie with an open mind I am sure you will find something or the other that will intrigue you.",1
509,10.0,"Kung Fu Panda adopts a different, less zany tone than one might expect from a movie with that title, especially considering that Jack Black has been brought on board to provide the lead voice. While it would be unfair to say that the movie doesn't present its share of comedic moments, the animated production as a whole jettisons non-stop jokiness in favor of something a little more serious. Thus, Kung Fu Panda ends up presenting a message about believing in oneself that might not have come across as successfully had it tended toward outright fatuousness.",1

514,,"Personally, I think this movie indicates the relationship between the big cities of Shanghai, and Beijing. If you assume that Panda represents Beijing power which is a central, dominate power in China,and Tiger represents Shanghai which is one of main cities in China which will lead China's economic development in the future. And Shanghai is eager to become independent from Beijing power(Panda). We can regard it as kind of anti-beijing Power(Tailung), however this movie actually reflects that Shanghai can not easily get rid of the central control of beijing, which panda represents.

You have to watch the movie.

I have searched the web and IMDb but cannot find any information about the Spanish actors, shouldn't they be credited as well. They did a superb job. The first scene in the ""gym"" where Po gets hit in the groin and says ""mis panditas, always gets a big laugh in Spanish language theaters where in the English version, his answer is mumbled as if it wasn't correct to make that kind of joke in a children's movie. I think the animation is fantastic and everything else, but the voices are the weakest part of the movie for me, sad after how much effort was put into the animation. If you don't speak Spanish, just listen to the tonality. The messenger duck who goes to the prison is a good example of the difference, the Spanish duck's voice is just right, the English version's is too deep.",1
