0,8.0,I teared up in a movie called Kung Fu Panda 2. What is my life?,0
1,7.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is pretty much everything a sequel should be. It builds upon its characters, it crafts a plot that is larger as well as more personal and its themes are even deeper than before. It sees Po (Jack Black), who has now been fully accepted by the furious five, forced to battle against a peacock named Lord Shen who plans to conqueror China with a new weapon. It doesn't seem like much on the surface, but Po begins to have flashbacks of why his parents abandoned him and it links directly back to Shen himself. Stories like this are brilliant because the set-up and main goal is relatively simple, but there is a very heartfelt and surprisingly emotion core to the film that is just fantastic.",1
2,10.0,"I had seen the teaser trailer for the awaited sequel for Kung Fu Panda...and I was psyched! Now I had seen Kung Fu Panda 2, and I find that both the original film and this sequel are both AWESOME!",1
3,10.0,If kung fu panda was star wars then this one is esb . This was back when jack black was at its peak with Angelina back when she was married to brad Pitt. This is also the first DreamWorks cartoon to be directed by a woman and has found great success in China. The success of this and the end of the trilogy has spawned a t.v. series and countless merchandise.,1
4,10.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is a rare sequel that comes close to outdoing the first film. I personally think this is the best of the series, as not only does it improve on the already brilliant aspects of Kung Fu Panda, but also adds an unexpected emotional weight to the characters and proceedings. It still continues to be funny, but trust me, the emotional moments are bound to hit you in the feels. I almost cried watching those moments, and there itself knew this was one of the strongest entries in the franchise.",1
5,9.0,"If I knew that I would give a sequel about a panda doing kung fu a 9 out of 10 I wouldn't believe it<br /><br />But my god this is how you do a sequel. I love the first movie, but the blend of comedy, Acton, atmosphere, plot and heart gives an actual emotional experience that completely trumps its predecessor<br /><br />There is no obvious flaws about this movie, it takes what 1 did good and improves it flaws to create an experience that's great for both kids and adults",1
6,,"I'd not seen the first Kung-Fu Panda film since it had come out in the late noughties, and I hadn't seen any of the other ones at all until it my toddler started watching them and I picked up 2 and 3 for her. After watching the first one loads, I managed to move her to the second, for my own variety as much as anything else. The plot sees Po trying to settle into his new role as Dragon Warrior, at the same time as a banished son returns to the city to use a new powerful weapon to seize control of the city and country. It has a slightly darker tone than the first film, because it touches on Po's backstory, and it carries itself with more dramatic sequences than the first film did (where we only got to see the power and anger of Tai Lung in a handful of scenes - mostly the film was about Po's training).",1
7,9.0,"The first ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a big surprise for moviegoers around the world. Critics and audiences, including myself, really enjoyed it's enjoyable martial arts story, beautiful animation and brilliantly developed characters. So when DreamWorks announced a sequel, I actually got very eager to see it. I went into the film very excited and walked out extremely satisfied because ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a very good sequel that steps up everything that made the first film work. It's one of those films that makes the story, characters and animation better.",1
8,9.0,"In my opinion, Kung Fu Panda 2 is severely underrated. Many seem to prefer the first one over this. However, I completely disagree. The first Kung Fu Panda movie is funny and has a simple story. This film is more emotional and character driven. Whereas the first film was about Po learning Kung Fu, this one focuses more on Po coming to terms with his tragic past.",1
9,10.0,"Furry, Ferocious and Fun!",1
10,10.0,"This movie's concept is pretty similar to How to Train your Dragon. Darker and maturer story and plot. But it is different in one way, the comedy is still there and it is a stronger comedy. This is a perfect sequel Dreamworks has done. Stronger comedy with a darker and maturer story, but Dreamworks remembers that this is a movie for kids and they never went ""over-maturer"". But they still made a movie that can entertain adults also. And also this is really touching which can tear up some others. I call this the best sequel and best movie of 2011.",1
11,10.0,"Who would have expected Kung Fu Panda to become a surprising, heartwarming summer hit back in 2008, where I thought it had captured the very essence of a typical martial arts film, and distilled it into an animated piece appealing both to kids and adults alike. The big risk involved is of course coming up with the inevitable follow up film given the profits that it had raked in, that won't be an insult to its fans, and yet maintaining that same level of appeal the original had. Kung Fu Panda 2 succeeded.",1
12,10.0,"The question that has been floating around about Kung Fu Panda 2 is if it is Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2 of animated sequels? Well, I'm happy to say it's Toy Story 2 kind of animated sequel - a genuine good movie that takes risks and succeeds rather than rehashing the first movie.",1
13,8.0,"Having seen and enjoyed (if not been bowled over by) the original, I was surprised and delighted by this movie that seems to prove that Dreamworks, while still not quite on a Pixar level (Yet!) could soon catch them up. It handles much more sensitive material than the first movie and tackles some truly dark and heavy subject material, but manages to keep it from becoming a drama by dropping in comedic material in a manner that is never jarring, out of place, or desperate. Lord Shen made for one of the most delightful villains of recent movie history. His push against the future contrasting with Po's struggle with the past was wonderful to watch. Po's talks with his father brought a tear to my eye in more than one moment in the film. This company and production team have firmly established themselves as formidable storytellers and I'm eager to see what's next.",1
14,9.0,"Now that is not to say the original Kung Fu Panda is a bad movie, actually it is a very entertaining movie and one of Dreamworks' better films. It's just that I preferred this sequel, I felt it had more heart and energy although the first film is not at all devoid of those qualities.",0
15,10.0,"""Kungfu Panda 2"" is an excellent sequel to an excellent preceding film and a truly fun film to experience with your family and friends. It is as enjoyable as watching through the first time, maybe even better. Here, the elements from the first film are improved and crafted for this sequel to create a wonderful, stunning, and memorable adventure that will surely entertain all its audiences and leave them hungry for more Po.",1
16,8.0,"My biggest fear about sequels is it's gonna end up pretty bad and ruin the first one. But I remember, Dreamworks already understand how to make a true good animated movie so I don't have to worry. Now the sequel just got more awesome. Non-stop action and non-stop laughs. The heart is also there. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is just as good as the first one.",1
17,8.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is better than the original. The main character actually has a character arc, and it feels more like a movie overall.",0
18,,There was so many ways the sequel could have been much worse but DreamWorks certainly surprised me with this movie.,1
19,10.0,"The first word I can say about this movie is, wow! Now once again I know that I enjoy animation movies more than anything but this is one of my top 5 favorites. Kung Fu Panda 2 when I first saw the trailer looked like a typical sequel and kind of a corny ending line, ""This could be the end of kung fu..."" despite the fact that I liked the first movie. However, the past tense of my sentence pretty much tells where this review is headed, not to mention the stars, but onto the review.",1
20,8.0,Kung fu panda 2 is a better made movie than Kung fu panda.,0
21,9.0,"Paper-cut shadows, ink folk music and various Chinese cultural elements are brilliantly integrated to tell: no matter how much pain in life and the past, we must grasp the present and strive for the future. In addition to the more difficult Kung Fu, there seems to be a problem. Po' s natural and extraordinary fate, Shen Wangye tried to change his destiny. As a result, everyone confirmed his destiny, so the foundation of everything is based on "" destiny by heaven ""?",1
22,,"Kung Fu Panda was huge in every sense, $631 million at the worldwide box office and an indelible character amply voiced by Jack Black. This is a voice role that may come to define his career, even though he does not actually appear in a single frame.",0
23,9.0,"Let me preface by saying I was rather unimpressed with the first Kung Fu Panda. As entertaining and well-choreographed as it was, it didn't pass my bar for mediocre DreamWorks animated movies. It was amusing and had some heart, but all-in-all was pretty expected. Now when I got a chance to see a preview of Kung Fu Panda 2, I was rather indifferent to seeing DreamWorks trying to pump out a mediocre sequel and a new franchise. But WOW... was I wrong! I take back everything I said earlier because, man oh man, I have to admit that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one of the best animated films I have ever seen.",0
24,,"Kung Fu Panda 2 was not as good as the original. The story isn't as good and neither is the ""Jack Black humor"" that made the original what it was. That being said, the villain is really good and the plot is still pretty good. 2 is also a little more predictable. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a good movie, although it fails to be as good as the first.",0
25,8.0,"Po the Dragon Warrior (Jack Black) is back. He's settled in and not only is he a cherished member of his kung fu team, but the people like him too. When a pack of wolves attack a village for their metal Po has a vision-- which was more like a snippet of a memory--and he then has the urge to find his roots. The mission given to him by his master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), set him on the path to find his origin. He only has to defeat the wicked power hungry peacock, Shen (Gary Oldman), who has figured out how to use gun powder for his nefarious aims.",1
26,8.0,"It may seem a little bit similar to its predecessor and has many silly scenes. But this sequel more than compensates those flaws. It brings in great animation to the solid world created. Giving us a lot more action to make it even more interesting than before when it opts for the comedy. Not to forget, there is a lot more heart and emotion that really give it a great amount of humanity. A isolid sequel to a solid kids film.",1
27,8.0,"This is one of those sequels that doesn't continue a story but still manages to be successful. Kung Fu Panda has a plot that is so concise and well made that you cannot continue the story. You can however create a new story within the universe and do so with wonderful development of characters you already know and create one centered around the concept of man vs machine. The cast and writing is just as good as the original but it still feels like a sequel. This franchise could have been a solo film and I think that it should have. However, after seeing the first one, the sequel is luckily an animated film worthy of attention.",1
28,9.0,They should really continue to add dark moments/elements to these movies. That seems to be a huge factor in why films like this one are so good. Absolutely love it!,1
29,10.0,"Wow, I can't believe this is actually my very first time writing a review on IMDB, I initially didn't think I'd be doing it for a movie like Kung Fu Panda 2, let alone a sequel for that matter, but oh well.",1
30,9.0,This installment of Kung Fu Panda exceeded my expectations in all respects.,0
31,8.0,"In a summer packed with superheroes, pirates, and aliens, I wouldn't have guessed that my favorite movie so far would involve animals doing martial arts. Kung Fu Panda 2 was extremely impressive.",1
32,,"I've been in China for a month, discovering calligraphic cinematic principles. I had a chance to see this film while there and note two remarkable aspects.",1
33,10.0,"First and one of the only films where I can recognise myself in. It's a short film, and it has flaws, but I love it nonetheless.",1
34,10.0,Better than the first and a deeper plot of adventure abd better animation throughout. Characters had diverse personalities creating a richer ensemble.,1
35,8.0,Nice and fun movie! Great fun to watch no matter what is your age!,1
36,9.0,"A couple of years ago during the summer time Kung Fu Panda came out, it was a cute film with a very predictable story. I liked it over all, but I couldn't get into the voices as much and also the story had been done to death. The overweight goofy outcast wants to be with the cool group, he finds out he can but doubts himself but gets with the group when he discovers who he is. The sequel I was thinking I could just wait for the rental which I did and I have to say that I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't see it in the theater. Kung Fu Panda 2 is very original and has some amazing characters as well as some very beautiful animation.",1
37,8.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2 is an ""awesome"" delight.",1
38,9.0,"This is a Dreamworks' animated sequel to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a story about noodle-shop worker-turned Dragon Warrior Po Ping, a giant panda. He joins elite Kung-Fu group the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- in protecting his home and the Valley of Peace. However, Po and the Furious Five learn that the treacherous Lord Shen of Gongman City is threatening the valley with a new weapon that threatens to end Kung Fu. While battling memory flashbacks of Lord Shen, Po attempt to stop Shen and learn the truth about his past. ",0
39,10.0,"Now known as the Warrior Dragon, Po protects the Valley of Peace along with his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five. However, a villainous danger threatens Po's impressive new life with planes to use a secret weapon to vanish martial art and conquer China. In order to defeat his new enemy, Po has to remember his past and unlock secrets from his mysterious origins.",1
40,10.0,"First off, I wanna say I was a huge fan of the first movie. I really didn't think the sequel would be better. But, it turned out to be much more emotional and slightly more intense than the original, which happened to be very intense. This movie definitely deserves a higher IMDb rating.",1
41,7.0,Kung Fu Panda 2,0
42,8.0,"In the Valley of Peace, Po the Dragon Warrior does battle with a new peacock villain Lord Shen who uses his new weapon to take over Gongman City. It's a canon and it threatens to make Kung Fu obsolete. Also Po must come to terms with his origins that haunts him with crippling flashbacks, and find inner peace. It is also needed to work out issues with his father Mr. Ping.",1
43,,"This film is about the Kung Fu Panda's journey to find who he really is, and along the way he saves China from evil forces.",1
44,6.0,"Just got home from watching the first showing of Kung Fu Panda 4 in local cinema with my kids. We were all very excited about it because we loved the first film very much because of the excellent animation, the snappy dialogues and above all, its heart.",1
45,7.0,Kung Fu Panda 2 is a bit darker than the first – as most sequels are – but there's nothing here that will damage your kids.,0
46,4.0,"Same disappointing effort as the first. This time Po must face some demons from his past and discover his inner peace. Once again it is the villain that really impresses, with Gary Oldman getting all the best material. His voice is everything an antagonist needs to be. Calm, sinister, with a certain ounce of charm. The flashbacks are represented in what looks like 2D hand drawn animation. These segments have more depth and emotion than anything else in the film. By this point even Dreamworks' capable skills look tired. Why concentrate so much on the hairs on an animals face when you can't even build up some believable camaraderie between the Furious Five. If at any point I'd believed these characters were in danger I may have actually given a damn about the action sequences. A few jokes work, baby Po is cute, but I can't really recommend this.",0

49,5.0,"DreamWorks Animation returns with more kid-friendly kung fu. Violence yes, but styled by Po Panda(voice of Jack Black). Po isn't totally happy helping his adopted father Mr. Ping(James Hong voice)at the noodle shop. His heart will race when called upon to face an evil Chinese peafowl Lord Shen(Gary Oldman). This conquest will also find the lovable panda searching for facts about his natural parents; and why are there no more pandas. Po's companions are back; Angelina Jolie as the voice of Tigress, Jackie Chan giving voice to Monkey and Lucy Liu the wispy voice of Viper. Computer generated battles supreme; very visual and entertaining. Master Shifu(voice of Dustin Hoffman) barely appears in this outing, but manages to deliver in a major way. This adventure stays right in step with the original. It is heart warming when Po discovers the truth about his past. A touching finale with the hero panda and adoptive goose father. Many other voices you may recognize: Dennis Haysbert, Seth Rogen, Jean-Claude Van Damme and David Cross. I'm surprised with the lack of ""potty"" humor that most animated fare features. There are many chances for young and old to laugh. Not quite as compelling as the original; but you get the sneaky suspicion we haven't seen the last of the Kung Fu Panda.",1
50,9.0,"I liked a lot the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" film, but I wasn't sure about the idea of a sequel (Especially considering how disappointing ""Cars 2"" was.) Fortunately it ended being incredibly good and funny, just like the first film. I think that, in some aspects, it was even better than the first movie, having more character and plot development. Instead of focusing too much in the new characters (Which, in my opinion, was the worst mistake from ""Cars 2"", and it is a common flaw in many sequels) ""Kung Fu Panda"" keeps the story focused in the characters from the first film, developing their personalities (Being the only exception Master Shifu, that here has just a secondary role) Anyway, I enjoyed a lot ""King Fu Panda 2"": The animation was excellent, the comedy was pretty effective, and it also added more elements to the plot from original movie, making it even better. And it also some heart-warming moments that worked very well, being one of the most enjoyable movies for the whole family from this year. ",1
51,5.0,"A few things can definitely be recommended about ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" in 3D and none of them have anything to do with Jack Black. Overall, the film gets mixed grades.",1
52,,"Kung-Fu masters led by the titled character (voiced by Jack Black) must join forces to fight an old enemy (a deranged peacock voiced by Gary Oldman) who has created a new weapon which threatens all which is good and right in animated Asia. Much darker and heavier than its predecessor, ""Kung-Fu Panda 2"" feels like it is somewhat forced as the movie gets into flashbacks and chaotic action sequences which sometimes become distracting to the warmth and complexities of the key characters involved. A bit on the scary side for really young age groups and not quite as compelling to older viewers, the movie is still successful overall but lacks the magic of the first. It also leaves the door open for more sequels by its finale. 4 stars out of 5.",1
53,6.0,"I loved the movie ""Kung Fu Panda"" and gave it a well-earned 9. However, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is like MOST CGI movies these days--an unnecessary sequel that was simply an excuse to bleed just a bit out of the original source material. Frankly, the plethora of sequels just seems very lazy and cynical towards the audience. Sure...""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is pretty good, but 'pretty good' is a far cry from the original. I sure would love to see an end to this awful practice.",0
54,5.0,"The first film was a good fun cartoon film, I was told by one or two people that the sequel is just as good (and it wouldn't really matter if you hadn't seen the first), so I decided to see it. Basically the film starts with the past, seeing the villain Shen the albino peacock (Gary Oldman) wanting to take over with the power of fireworks, and being told by The Soothsayer the elderly goat (Michelle Yeoh) that a warrior of black and white will one day defeat him, he obviously knows she means a panda, so has them all killed. Then skip forward to the present day, Po the tongue-in-cheek giant panda (Jack Black) has now established himself as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside the Furious Five: Tigress the South China tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). Master Shifu the red panda (Dustin Hoffman) tells the hero however he needs to achieve inner peace, and while there is an attack by Shen's army of wolves, Po has an unexpected flashback of his mother, and his Chinese goose father Mr. Ping (James Hong) admits he found him in a basket of radishes and adopted him. Shifu receives word that Master Thundering Rhino (Titanic's Victor Garber) has been killed, and that Shen has created a powerful cannon to destroy the kung fu tradition and conquer China, so the panda and the Furious Five head for Gongmen City to stop her. They find imprisoned Master Storming Ox (Dennis Haysbert) and Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme), but they refuse to escape believing the weapon is too powerful and they will all be defeated, but they do leave, but are captured by the Wolf Boss (Danny McBride). They are taken to Shen, and breaking free they destroy the weapon, but Po allows the villain to get away after being distracted by another unexpected flashback, so he wants to question the peacock about his involvement. Despite being told by Tigress to stay behind, Po goes to Shen who tells him that his parents abandoned him before blasting him with the factory cannon, but he is found alive by the exiled Soothsayer. She tells the panda hero the story of what happened in the past, his parents sacrificed him during the attacks on all pandas, and his mother placed him in the crate of radishes. Realising he had a happy life with his adoptive father, Po finds inner peace at the critical moment when the cannon is going to attack, and the kung fu power destroys it, and Shen ends up killing himself refusing to give himself up. In the end Po returns to the Valley of Peace once again praised by everyone as a hero, and he declares his love for his adoptive father like his real one, but the final moment of the film sees Po's true biological father (Fred Tatasciore) sensing that his son is alive. Black once again gives a good vocal performance, Oldman is just as good the villain (even though I didn't know it was him until the end), and the supporting cast all do good too, it is pretty much the same quality as the first film, and of course the open ended final scene gives way for another follow up, a fun family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!",1

58,5.0,"KUNG FU PANDA 2 is a sequel to the first Dreamworks animation that improves things considerably, although the film is still flawed in having an annoying, unsympathetic hero in the form of Jack Black's Po. The good news is that the plot is more action packed this time around, with less time for the kind of dumb slapstick comedy that spoilt the first, and the voice cast is better: Gary Oldman on villain duties alongside many famous faces popping up in support.

Po and his friends are back and this time they must stop an evil peacock from destroying kung-fu. Po must learn to deal with his past in order to once again save China and the art form. To me this movie and ""Cars 2"" both had the same problem. Both were made as kids movies but with adult story lines. The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy. I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were. Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring. If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better. Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail. Two and eight year olds don't care about stories they want up beat and funny, not a panda figuring out his past. Overall, a kids movie that tried to be to adult and didn't work.

66,7.0,I took my grandson to see kung fu panda because I really enjoyed the first one. This one unfortunately is not as fun as that one but it passes. The animation again is stellar and Jack Black again does a good job as Po. I am going to disagree with the critics the story is coherent and both stories (Po's search and the peacock's) do work if you are intelligent enough to see it. What I found irritating though is that it seemed to go on longer than the 90 minutes. I think it was because on like the first one it took too long for the Po to get it. Also the fight scenes were way too long and draw out for me. Yes the kung fu was good but it seemed to go on forever. The movie did redeem itself in the end and that's why I gave it 7/10.,1

71,5.0,Panda and Kung fu China Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism at its best.,1
72,9.0,Kung Fu panda 2 is awesome the one of the few sequels which better than the original movie cinematography is great music is perfect for the atmosphere of china acting is great especially when it comes to Gary oldman this man is badass and his character lord chin is the greatest villain of DreamWorks animation but this doesn't mean the others are bad every character got it's development this built on the first movie and the story is great just like a myth directing either is great he used my favorite comedy style the situations but he misplaced it a little bit but it's fine so I will give this one 8.5/10 and it's better than the original.,1

75,7.0,I went into this without enthusiasm. I quite liked its predecessor but it left no lasting impression - this may be because Jack Black simply doesn't do anything for me (although I do prefer him when I can't see him).,1
76,9.0,This movie is just purely epic down to the amazing animation of the panda fur. it was the coolest scene ever when he grabbed the yin yang ball and threw it because he had finally achieved balance as all things should be. this movie is so cool when he gained inner peace and the movie showed his backstory it was so sad and beautiful i almost cried. also the villain was awesome he was like a knife ninja and he had a pretty good motive and was a formidable opponent. the comedy from this movie is good and the jokes don't overstay their welcome. the lamb lady is so cool when she is cool under pressure and knows backstory. the most awesome scene was when all the gang jumped in the air and po said in slo motion i love you guys it was so epic and brought a tear to my eye. in the end this movie is a big 10/10 and has many epic and heartfelt moments. the final battle is so awesome because po has inner peace but the villain doesn't and thats how po destroys the ship by deflecting the balls just like the dew drop on the leaf. po had to learn by discovering his past not by being a fat slob like in the first one.,1
77,7.0,"I guess I will have to make a confession that will get the Dreamworks crowd all worked up: while I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, I'm not one of the many who hold it up on as high a pedestal as the superior Monsters Vs. Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels.

79,4.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011): Dir: Jennifer Yuh / Voices: Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Seth Rogen: Every bit as bland as the first film despite its colourful images. This time out Po the kung fu Panda desires to know where he came from and what happened to his original family. Shen the peacock is the new villain who leads a pack of wolves into battle and only Po and his allies can stop them. Sounds standard and delivers on just that. While the first film is no dud, it certainly didn't avoid every martial arts cliché it could find. Jennifer Yuh does well directing but the film fails to deliver a compelling story. Jack Black voices Po who remains a likable presence despite his stereotypical friends. He searches for his past and realizes that he has forgotten it due too a trauma. He proves to overcome his dilemma while his enemy cannot. Angelina Jolie voices Tigress who comes to life more as an animation as oppose to a personality. The same can be said of Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman who seems only as the countless reference to Yoda. The only other character of interest is villain Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman. We learn of Shen's upbringing and how he was banished, and the revenge he sought that would ultimately consume him. Other characters are paper thin although any one of the animals would make for a great documentary on wildlife program. The animation is as stunning as that of the first film but the story itself fails to lift off the screen. We are left with images of Asia and greater desire to watch something far more entertaining such as Animal Planet. Score: 4 / 10",0

The premises of Shrek meeting Fiona's parents or Alex the Lion discovering his roots in the savanna inspired entertaining and emotional stories.

It's embarrassing, but there were portions that had me tearing up as much as the five-year-old next to me. Overall, the sequel lives up to the first movie and even manages to exceed it in terms of the level of depth of its message. True, the kung fu parts (which are even more abundant in the sequel) are a big portion of Kung Fu Panda's appeal, but what makes it memorable is the message it's trying to convey. I'm going back to watch it again as soon as I'm done with this review.",1

The story just wasn't as gripping as the original and the development of the characters wasn't as good.

The build up isn't as great this time, it's okay but not great. But when the action kicks in, you just can't help but be amazed at how creative and entertaining the action sequences are. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing, it just seems kinda off but that is only a very small complaint. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy while watching. I had a blast seeing all the awesome fight sequences. This really felt like a legit kung-fu flick that kids can watch and have a blast with. Right after the movie was over I wanted to watch it again to see the action sequences all over again. Yeah some people judge a movie by the plot the most, the plot here is okay.

However, I was pandily surprised that ""Kung Fun Panda 2"" played at more being a prequel than a sequel. Dragon Warrior Po (awesomely voiced again by Jack Black) is now on a mission to defend Kung Fu & China with his mates ""The Furious Five"" against an evil peacock called NBC, I mean Shen. However, within the fighting pandamonium there is also a subplot in the movie of Po trying to search his past and figure out who he really is and where he is from. The two plot lines interconnect in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" not just to provide narrative depth to the movie, but to present how one's upbringing is so relevant to one's survival & also character. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" looks beautiful on screen, and besides the latest computer graphic animation design included in the movie there is also ""old school"" simple animation inserted to differentiate the time periods. Director Jennifer Yuh did a yeoman's job or should I say yuhwoman's job by incorporating noble Chinese culture into the narrative, as a love letter to China. However, Yuh did get carried away with too many explosion sequences that for the most part bombed. Nevertheless, it is the comedic protagonist Po that makes the Kung Fu Panda movies work. Po still demonstrates that his love for the culinary arts is still his favorite thang! This Panda still loves to munch it down. I just hope we don't see an offshoot of his dietary habits in a Part 3 called ""Kung Poo Panda"". Besides Black, Angelina Jolie also nailed it once again with her lipwork as Tigress, 20% of The Furious Five. Gary Oldman playing a villain never gets old, and he does some badass vocal work as Shen the Peacock. Dustin Hoffman just gets in a scene or two this time around voicing Master Shifu, but when Hoffman speaks you better listen ""He's talking here!!"". ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" does not hit on all cylinders, but it is no ancient Chinese secret that it is quite entertaining, mostly due to its Black comedy! **** Good",1

Sadly the lack of creativity often clearly shows and then we ask ourselves, what was the point in having a sequel if you're just recycling everything from the first story to begin with? Dreamworks sadly did that with its biggest production with the ""Shrek"" series. By the time you get to the fourth installment, it becomes more labouring than enjoyable to watch. Fortunately, Dreamworks rebounded by taking the success of the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" and made the effort to shift the narrative into a newer direction. Sure most of the cast return for a second helping of kung fu action, whimsical comedy, and larger than life characters. Only this time, writer Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger along with first time director Jennifer Yuh Nelson as they took the time to explore Po's (Jack Black) origins and what happened to his biological parents and the further we dig deeper into his past, the more I took pity and sympathy for Po. The script and the direction made great strides to take this story to a more darker route, but not too dark being that it is still an attraction for the younger viewers only this time the adults can find something interesting for them that won't insult their intelligence.

The fact that Po just simply find a way to realize the marshal art by 'thinking' about it and call it destiny is none-sense. For any marshal art, the worriers need to practice and maybe in older age, they will find inspiration so they can realize the true arts and have the break through. Otherwise, you are some kind of genius and very suitable to practice marshal art and learn something from special scroll or something, then you can learn the true art. In the first movie, at least ShiFu somehow find a way to train Po so he becomes strong in the end. Still ridiculous but acceptable. In the second story, that part of the story is just so thin and Taichi just suddenly fall in onto the lab and he becomes the master of it OK, if you just simply for a laugh and try to watch the cute panda, it is OK. However, what you have not seen in the second movie that is not in the first one? The story is not funny anymore, Panda is the same as before and the whole thing really just rushed all way to the end. The parents-son relationship is pretty thin as well.

This movie can't pick an angle to save it's life and tries to fit two extremes into one script. The tonal whiplash is so bad. The main character meets the man who committed genocide on his kind and killed his mother in front of him as a baby. Sounds intense, right? What if we crammed half of that scene with lame gross-out and gender jokes that have terrible delivery and timing?!! Same thing happens every encounter with Po and Shen. Shen is Po's greatest personal challenge in the entire franchise, and the writers can't go without squeezing in an unfunny joke every five seconds. Just great. Basically every scene where Po interacts with Shen. It's two extremes that don't mix together because it's too much on both ends for the tone to be consistent. Either be a goofy, crass comedy based DreamWorks movie, or a daring and heartbreaking drama based DreamWorks movie.

124,9.0,"OK now remember the first Kung Fu Panda movie? Well next to the first Shrek movie that is arguably my favorite Dreamworks movie. Kung Fu Panda was a good movie even though some people didn't like it. Either way is Kung Fu Panda 2 a good movie? Dreamworks hasn't done so well with sequels, but let me tell you, this is a great sequel and a good movie. First off this movie has terrific animation. Seriously. The graphics, and fine details on everything is very good, and the lighting effects really make this movie stand out. The movie has a great artistic style, even more so than the last movie. So now you know that this movie will not disappoint graphically. One of the things I really liked about this movie is that the main villain is established very early on... like at the beginning credits. This allows you to understand the main villain throughout the entire movie. This makes Lord Shen much better than Tai Lung who was still a good villain, but not as good. Lord Shen is a white peacock which really makes his evil side stick out. He was son of the rulers of China, and after being banished for reasons I won't say, he wants his throne back. This villains as I said before is good. When he fights it is unlike Tai Lung because he is a peacock. Tai Lung fought with muscle, Lord Shen fights with agility, speed, and blades. Also Lord Shen does act like a bird which is cool. When you see him walking around, or observing people, he really does look like a bird which I thought was really neat. The characters in this movie get a bit more face time which was a problem in the last movie. They have more dialogue (especially Tigress) and you get to see them fight a lot. Shifu doesn't have much face time in this movie which I was kind of sad to see, but when you do see him it is always great. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It has tons of action sequences and they are all good. The choreography was excellent, and the fights scenes were original. If there is one thing that slightly bothered me, it was some of the slapstick humor kind of got old. It sort of distracted when there is a serious action sequence and then slapstick gets thrown in. But that's just me. Like the first movie the soundtrack is very good. Only in one scene did the music seem off, which was a jail breaking scene. Thankfully that track was only a minute long or so.

At the narrative arc, sage Soothsayer, voiced with eloquent gravitas by the amazing Michelle Yeoh, instructs the Kung fu Panda Po, ""Let it flow."" She tells him to let go of his painful stories of the past. In doing so, he has nothing, and everything is possible. She reminds Po that all he has is right now, and the rest of his life.

Besides, this was Dreamworks, the studio whose trademark in films is a heavy reliance on pop culture references and broad satire to the point of overkill and whose greatest hit, arguably still the first Shrek at that point, had been diluted by a series of mediocre, unstoppable sequels; they weren't Pixar, after all. But then, something surprising happened: it premiered at Cannes to shockingly positive reviews, and when the audience also responded with fervor, gone were the Pixar comparisons. Instead, people began to buzz about the rich, colorful animation, Black's pitch-perfect voice casting as Po, the way it managed to be light and fun (not to mention funny) while still having a sweet, heartfelt message without the *wink wink* pretensions of films like Ice Age or Shark Tale, which always seemed to be trying too hard – and failing – to engage adults as well as younger folks.

136,10.0,"Kung Fu Panda 2, Po's new adventure where he finds out about his parents and his sacked village when he was a baby bear. Left by his mother to escape the carnage by Shen (Gary Oldman) who uses the dark arts of making black powder more powerful as a weapon. In the care of Ping (James Hong) as his adopted father, starts Po on his journey to discover his true roots. The movie is excellent as the original cast was used to give their lively voices the needed boost to give the audience what they crave. To see Po and the furious five back in action. Yet this time, Po learns the way of inner peace using old memories of his past to stop Shen and his madness. Dustin Hoffman is as always, though through a smaller part, excellent as master Shifu, Po's instructor who tries to explain to Po how inner peace really works. But Po gets his idea from another who is a soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). I thought this was a great addition to the character cast, her ability to give the mysteries of the universe using her juxtaposition conundrums was quite inspiring. And of course, new additions to the group, such as Master ox and Master Croc (Jean Claude Van Damme) who give a performance just as lively and inspiring as the furious five do. But now in this case, it is the furious seven. Plus this also opens a door for another movie for which Po's parents might still be alive and in hiding. All in all, a fantastic movie with action, humour, fireworks, and puzzling riddles for which a person or panda might bang their head against a wall for to try and figure it out. Highly recommended.",1

139,8.0,"This is a sequel that I can't tell is either better or worse than the original. Now I did really enjoy the first movie, it wasn't perfect, but it was fun, funny, had great animation, good voice acting, and actually had a pretty good story.

So what you get is a pretty damn good sequel.",1

One or two of the gags didn't quite come off (for me) but I can forgive that for a very well put together entertaining film Recommended.",1
141,9.0,"I was one of the many fans of the first 'Kung Fu Panda' movie. It was an entertaining piece of animation, and the action was quite enjoyable for an entire family. Now, DreamWorks Animation has brought us ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". The sequel now brings some action-packed fight scenes, and some exciting new characters. The film brings us back to the tale of the Dragon Warrior, Po, portrayed by Jack Black, who has spent the rest of his life as the Dragon Warrior, learning the sacred teachings of Master Shifu, and fighting crime with the Furious Five (Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane, Mantis). Now, a villainous peacock named Emperor Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman, has been planning revenge to the land of China, and has created a deadly weapon that could destroy China, and the existence of kung-fu. But while Po and the Furious Five must team up to defeat Shen, Po faces problems of his own, by trying to understand his origin, who he really is, where did he really come from, who were his real parents, and how did he live with a long-necked goose for a father. Then we have our movie, and it's awesome! From start to finish, this movie is entertaining as hell. The voice talent is just super, since the ensemble from the previous film has returned, such as Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Jackie Chan. Now, there's Gary Oldman, who's one of the most perfect actors to play villains in the history of cinema. He resembles the previous villain, Tai Lung, perfectly. You really love to hate this guy, and he delivers the role in such a powerful way. The animation is gorgeous, the humor is hilarious, and the heart of this movie made me cry of joy. Also, the fight scenes are both exciting and family-friendly, and we also receive some interesting character development on Po's character, and the movie perfectly reveals his origin. But, the ending of the movie will make audiences go ""wow"". But it mostly means that a ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" may be in session. Fun characters, great storyline, terrific animation, and incredible fight scenes. What a family-friendly piece of entertainment. Go check it out with your kids, they will love it, and so will you. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", in my review, ""family-friendly action, funny and moving"".",1

For some reason (Angelina Jolie's voice acting? Encroaching senility?) I recalled, incorrectly, liking the first KFP. I got my hands on this, queued it up, and then read my review of the first one (maybe I should have performed those tasks in a different order). When I recalled how kind of flat I thought the first one was, I thought, well, maybe this one will be better.",0
143,5.0,"I didn't like that the majority of the movie was a war between Po & the villain Peacock with too much fighting. There were so many canons exploding with fire & destruction. It was a war zone with so many look alike bad guys fighting & it just got monotonous. I started phasing out, turned the obnoxious explosion sounds down & became bored. I like watching Po interact with his father, the master teacher, & the 4 heros the best. That's when Po makes me laugh and smile.",0

This film also has a message what I thought to be really wonderful and mature which elevated this film even further. Was honestly expecting to be disappointed since sequels usually turn out to be bad, but that's not the case here. Initially I thought it was going to be boring with so many unnecessary characters like the wolves and all but then the film really starts to pick up and gets down to the actual story.

148,8.0,"The second-installment of this SUV of an animated trilogy, in which the cuddly yet formidable Po's backstory and emotions peak out, occasionally and unevenly, behind the overall goofiness. Once again the animation is beautiful and the action and story development perfectly balanced for children's enjoyment. If the first movie was about Po coming to terms with his body and eating habits, this one tackles personal history, in the form of Po's involuntary and debilitating flashbacks: the persecution of his panda village by the maniacal crane, leading to his parents hiding him for safety and his eventual discovery by his loving, dumpling-cooking adopted father (who is a goose). For me the best and most touching part of the movie was the strong friendship which develops between Po and Tigress, his co-captain or second in command (It's ambiguous). She helps him overcome his fears and eventually stand up to crane and come to terms with his early history, so far as he can reconstruct it. Cue the sequel...",1

150,8.0,"""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a worthy sequel to the beloved original film. The animation is top-notch, with the fight scenes being particularly impressive. The story continues to follow Po, the lovable panda, as he continues his journey to become the Dragon Warrior. This time, he must face a new villain, Lord Shen, who poses a threat to the entire valley. The film's themes of self-discovery and inner strength are handled with maturity and depth, making it a satisfying watch for both children and adults. The vocal performances, particularly Jack Black as Po, are also excellent. Overall, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a well-crafted and entertaining addition to the franchise.",1
151,9.0,"The sequel to the hit ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008) (excuse the pun) really developed into a new level. From the first film we see Po's character develop from a big blob of a panda into a kung fu warrior. We also are introduced to the Furious Five. So the foundation of the characters is laid to allow the sequel to go all out in creating a substantial story. Yet, there is still development in Po's character for we discover his past and find out how indeed his father is a duck (or goose) anyway...I loved that the story was deep and it was still character driven. The relationship of the father and Po is really special and amusing due to the obvious appearance differences. This film is so much fun, for both adults and children, you will not be disappointed. I also loved the fact that the film managed to convey a deep message and yet it did not feel corny or cheesy. The message is about letting go of your troubled past and moving on into your future. There is also a shocking and awesome ending, the ending sequences are awesome. DreamWorks has done it again!",1

The story was pretty much the same, only with a new enemy.

There was a lot of nostalgia during those scenes.",1
157,10.0,"Kung Fu panda was a perfect movie, and when they made a sequel, I was a bit concerned. But OH MY GOD, DREAMWORKS DID THE IMPOSSIBLE AND MADE A PERFECT SEQUEL AND PERFECT MOVIE. I LOVED this movies dark tone, the flashback scene for example, shen is the most memorable DreamWorks villian. The first movie had tai lung who was tied to shifu, but then in this movie, they had shen, who was a personal threat to Po, who murdered his mother and several other pandas, it doesn't get much darker than that. While this movie is nowhere as funny as the first one, That's totally fine because we replaced the comedy with an emotional, dark, perfect masterpiece. The music is AMAZING. The scene where Po learns inner peace is in my top 5 favorite moments in a film. The stakes are obviously really high. This is definitely one of the greats.",1

The 5 are back, as the star of the show Poe, has gotten way more martial arts training and is now living his dream out as the dragon warrior. A new villain in the form of a peacock....A peacock!!! anyhow he is threatening to put a stop to both martial arts and China in general. This leads Poe, along with the furious 5 to help him dive deep into his roots to come back and conquer this new foe!

160,7.0,"I wasn't a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda and found it ultimately boring though I described it as mildly entertaining. I was persuaded to give Kung Fu Panda 2 a try by my friend and to be honest I was willing to give it a go even though I was quite sceptical. But surprise and behold this was a really great sequel to the first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I felt that much more effort was put into this and a result it is much more entertaining. The story itself was better with more in-depthness about Po's past, the animation was far better visually then the first one with the 3D being quite impressive. The action was choreographed better and more exciting to watch with the voice-over being great from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman (Shen), Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen. But Jack Black was the revelation as Po who bought even more charm to his character. However for me Gary Oldman as the voice of Shen the villain Peacock stole the film and was superb and made quite a menacing villain for a kids movie (plus funny too). ",1

There's not a single scene that will bore you. Jack Black as Po, this time is accompanied by the first movies' cast, Angleina Jolie as Tigress, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu...with a few new additions including Gary Oldman as the wonderfully voice-overed (Po's) menace, Shen; Michelle Yeoh, Jean Claude Van Damm, Dennis Hayesbert etc. Jack Black & Gary Oldman steals every scene they are in; together or apart.",1
162,,"Rarely,some sequels gets good in the first few minutes and then, it loses its magic throughout the rest of the film {take ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" and ""Batman & Robin"" for example}. Well, Dreamworks's ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" gets it and it handles it with less irony and a little wit.",0
163,8.0,"I'm impressed that the makers took the relatively small concept and actually the expanded the story.<br /><br />And I'm glad you've improved all the things that did not vote in the first part, at least with the characters here.<br /><br />You clearly see a change but also a form of confusion compared to the predecessor because they can not believe how they all started and you see that the respect of others has earned and the recognition that he built here.<br /><br />But ""A hero is only as good as his villain.""<br /><br />And this is even better managed. This ""Lord Shen"" is everything I want from a good villain. He is strong, smart, brave and a good fighter. But above all, really diabolical.<br /><br />Really has a personal connection to our hero unlike any other.<br /><br />Is everyone still funny that makes it so entertaining to see I like to see him but thanks to his actions I want to see how he loses.<br /><br />That makes a great villain and his wonderful noble design gives him even a bit of class so he really deserves the title Lord.<br /><br />I did not expect to hear anything about genocide in a children's movie. And it did not just seem to be thrown in, it was as if it had been planned from the start. A personal vendetta against the hero is one thing, but eradicating the entire Panda people puts them at such a new level of villains that I'm used to in animated films.<br /><br />That was just great, that's why every time the two clashes at the edge of my seat, I did not know who was going to win and because I did not know how to cheer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he dies in a rather unspectacular way and loses his coolness in the last few moments, but it's literally only 2 seconds, so he's forgiven.<br /><br />It's just wonderful I want to see where the journey leads us next and I can not wait to see more of it.",1

167,8.0,"One thing that DreamWorks does well (with the exception of Shrek the Third) is sequels. They prove time and time again that they are very legit company in many cases, does better then its animated counterparts. Kung Fu Panda 2 is no exception as it seems the franchise is well at hand. After the incredible year of 2010 for DreamWorks after the cultural success of How to Train Your Dragon, and ending a great franchise (Shrek) they follow that year up with this. The movie's strengths are found within the story, not that its unique, but the secret ingredient found within. The secret ingredient is heart. Its not totally comedic as one would expect, but in the middle they tweak the film's tone with heart and emotion. This is what a proper sequel should do, taking the story and making it more then what we'd expect. Is this film a rehash from the last? Well, not really it offers new elements, especially to Po's character. The other characters are still they're same likable selves. In this however they really showcase the relationship growing between Po and Tigress which is the most unique and pleasurable relationship. The next thing is the villain voiced by Gary Oldman. He is the most interesting and menacing out of the villains so far. And that's hard to make a peacock menacing, and they did it like pros. Now the negative I have is what I said before, with the story not being unique and refreshing, but that's a slight error as the film makes up with heart. So a very small negativity. As a whole this film is one of DreamWorks' best. Now to grade. Animation: A Voice Acting: A- Story: C+ Music: B+ Characters: A+ Overall: B+",1
168,8.0,"Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example). Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies. However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills. Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.",1

With a joyful spirit and an active appetite, it is of great news that Po is ready for another adventure. Foes should be fearful.

176,,"This movie seems to fall short of the previous film like most DreamWorks sequels do. The studio seems to make entertaining original flicks, but they try to cash in on the fame of the first movies and overstuff the audience with weak follow ups. When it was announced that they were making a sequel to the first Kung Fu Panda it caught a lot of people of guard because the first movie ended well enough that it shouldn't have been a follow up. This movie tumbles short of creativity and freshness that the first movie had, but improves the action and exploring the world of Kung Fu Panda. The action in this film is top notch and very dazzling at times. It has more fight sequences that I would not expect in an animation film, but works quite well. It brings the movie full speed when flat moments arise. The plot of the movie is not as fresh as the first and seems to drag at times, but that's when the other elements start to come alive. The additional component that works well in this movie is the CGI. Its so well done and life like that you are pull visually to a new level. There are certain scenes that just had me stunned at how breath taking it looks. In addition to that, the 3D works well with the film and I believe DreamWorks studio does a great job of adding that portion into their animation films. Other than those various things, this movie has nothing else to offer. This movie in a way feels lazy at times as if the screen writers just start to throw things in the film to propel dull moments. The past animation characters and new ones they bring to the film do nothing to make their present worthwhile. They are mainly placed in the film to carry the story along for us to learn more about Po back story. The movie also tries to hit on an emotional level just as the previous film did, but seems to try too hard and fails at its task. Adding this extra feature is an attempt to connect with the older audience, but doesn't get plugged in all the way. This movie has enough distractions that keeps the flow of the film moving quite nicely for kids to enjoy, but older spectators will not be easily swayed like the first Panda movie seem to accomplish.",0

180,8.0,"Jack Black is at his best when embodying an unlikely kung fu fighting Panda named Po. With more action and even better visuals than the original, Kung Fu Panda 2 is successful at being a memorable and entertaining sequel. Behind the scenes, Direcor Jennifer Yuh creates the visuals of the film by pairing unique 2D story telling animation with traditional contemporary 3D distinguishing between various elements of the film's story. The story builds off of the first film very well continuing the growth of Po as the Dragon Warrior. Questions not explored in the original are delved into uncovering where Po came from. Because lets face it Mr. Ping (James Hong, ""Mulan"") isn't exactly a panda and is only Po's adopted father. Even so, Mr. Ping acts as a very good loving father and is aided by Po's newfound glory with the growth of his noodle shop's popularity. Po does not see his adopted father as much because of Po's new responsibilities and search for his real parents. A new power crazy antagonist by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman, ""The Dark Knight"") joins the series threatening the extinction of kung fu forever with the creation of a new weapon. With the help of the furious five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie, ""The Tourist""), Monkey (Jackie Chan, ""The Karate Kid""), Mantis (Seth Rogen, ""Paul""), Viper (Lucy Liu, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1), and Crane (David Cross, ""Megamind""), Po must save kung fu and China. But where would these six be without Dustin Hoffman reprising his role as the wise Master Shifu providing Po with a new challenge to find and master inner peace.",1
181,,"I went in knowing that the first KFP could not be topped. The newness of the concept, the opening fantasy sequence, the Tai Lung escape scene, the clumsy humor of Po, I could go on...no beating it or duplicating it. The sequel doesn't beat it. But it's still very good. And for very different reasons from those that made the original was so awesome. In KFP2 the Furious Five have grown, moved on. They've improved their kung fu. They work as a unit, with a new leader, Po the Dragon Warrior, whom they've fully accepted. The banter between the team is raised to a new level. The rocky relationship between Tigress and Po is replaced by friendship. The action scenes where they're all fighting together are...something not seen in the first movie, actually. The story is excellent, centering on Po's search for his real parents. It's a little bit more intense than the first, with a lot more weapons used than last time. It's just more of an action movie. There were a lot of kids there when I saw it(ages 6-12 I'd guess) and I heard a lot of comments during and after the movie. Universal approval. There will be another in this series. Hopefully we'll see more of Shifu, who only shows up at the beginning and end of '2.'",1

184,2.0,"I gave the first film an A+ because the story and characterization matched Jack's humor perfectly. This film falls far short mainly because it lacks any real tension at all. In the first film, Po has severe tension with all the main characters--good and bad. The conflict between Po and Mr Ping his Dad, Po and Master Shifu, Po and the Fantastic Five, Po and Tigress, Po and his eating dysfunction, Po and learning Kung-Fu was severe and superb. All the tension was excellently crafted and laid the foundation for humor to release the tension at just the right times. Ian McShane's Tai-Lung was a far better villain and the tension between them was excellent. This sequel could have created a new type of tension with all the characters. Perhaps there could have been treachery within the Fantastic Five(or just perceived treachery), or perhaps a severe misunderstanding with Shifu. But no, instead the story writers gave very weak tension between Po and Master Ox and Croc and minor tension with Po saving China from the evil Shen. The Wolf Boss and wolves, nor the Gorillas were ever perceived as on Shen's side or even a threat, really. The writers even included a fortune-teller that ruined ANY tension between Po and Shen and the eventual outcome altogether. Very anti-climactic. The story about his adoption was touching, and the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of 1.",1

The main villain and his relationship with Po is amazing ( Gary Oldman did a really great acting work). Shen is amazing, he is a total badass and a really scary character. Po's story is so heartbreaking,but also so amazing it often makes me cry, because it's so good written. A relationship with his father is so lovely showed. A relationship with Tigress is also a warm shown. There are a lot of amazing scenes like this one where he finds the truth. A lot of amazing details like the color changing of the bullets. Soundtrack is also well put to the movie scenes. This is not also one of the best movies in the world this also easily the best Kung Fu Panda movie.

However, it is rare to find a sequel that boasts to be just as good if not better than the original, and this is one of those rare films. This one takes you behind the story of how Po came to be who he is, and I loved that concept. They took all the great elements of the first and emphasized them in this one, which is a smart move...the only thing missing was the ""skidoosh!"" and that is a shame. They gave every character a little more. Even Tigress, who barely had any lines in the first, had a bigger role in this one. The action was greater, the villain was greater, and the story was greater. To top it off, the very final scene before the credits caused me to burst into tears of excitement!

He's a goofball with a good heart, and tries hard to fill a serious role, but he thinks that also means being cool, which unfortunately never works out for him.

It is stunningly beautifully animated, especially in its set pieces, which are even more ambitious than the first film. The music is once again wonderfully atmospheric. Whilst it would have been nice to see a little more character development from characters other than Po, this might have over complicated matters, and the film relies, quite rightly, on its slickness and pace to ramp up the drama. The story itself is well crafted, the villain excellent, and the finale is, strange though it may be to say it, one of my all-time favourite pieces of cinema. It is exciting, moving, and amusing in one explosive great cocktail (or should I say peacocktail?) A film I never get tired of watching - superb entertainment.",1

It also provides a story surprisingly darker than the first, but it's exactly the plot's darker turn that gives it more depth.",1
213,10.0,"Sequels never usually measure up to the standards of their predecessors. However, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an exception, not only is as good as the first film, it's even better. This is what I would call a perfect film, from the beginning to the end. A strong factor of the film is that they have continued the story instead of rehashing it. For example, Po is still likable but has developed in his Kung Fu, while the Five and Shifu have grown to respect and care about Po and not just making fun of him. There is an introduction of new likable characters such as the wise soothsayer or the humorous Master Croc(voiced by martial arts icon Jean Claude Van Damme). In the first film I felt the villain (Tai Lung) was cool but Garry Oldman's Lord Shen is quite the opposite. He has the right balance of malice and humor that in my opinion puts him on the same levels of animated villains such as Scar, Shere Khan or Gaston. The animation and action were both superb while Hans Zimmer and John Powell combined to make one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is not only an animated masterpiece but is also one of my favorite films of all time. ",1

Since then, everyone love the film. But the question remains; where did Po come from? Why was his dad a goose? Well 3 years later, we finally got our answer in Kung Fu Panda 2. In the latest news of the sequel, a peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) wanted nothing more but to make his parents proud (much like Tai Lung wanted to please Master Shifu in the first film.) but when a Soothsayer confirmed to his folks that he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white (remind you of anyone?)

223,9.0,"WOW. Thats the only word i uttered during my KUNG FU PANDA 2 experience, Im confident that you will be the same. The visuals are unparallelled, the story is as touching as Toy Story 3 and the main character every bit as lovable as he was in his first outing. Jack Black returns to the role I'm sure will be what he will always be remembered for, Po the Panda. The all star voice cast is by the far the highlight, with everyone involved being given the chance to have a bit more fun with their respective characters. The story, to which i wont go into too much detail, follows Po on his journey for inner peace, and to take down evil Peacock, LORD SHEN. Comedy ensues, as does (quite surprisingly) a whole lot of heart and the best animated fight scenes to date. Loved everything about this movie. Highly recommended. 9/10",1

As a sequel the risks were to the downside but this time it was the other way around. It is light, colorful, packed with pretty cool action scenes, and most importantly, it was engaging and touching. The search for the ""inner peace"" and for Po's family history at the same time worked very smoothly. As the story unfolds the concept of inner peace is developed and the ending is magnificent. Very touching for an adult. I can't imagine how special this is for a child (I believe they must get this easier than anyone else). I highly recommend this film for everyone but specially for those with children.",1
225,9.0,"I can't think of anything I enjoy in the first movie that did not also show up here. All characters have distinct personalities which shine in every movement and speech pattern, the kung fu fights are still very entertaining to watch, both the soundtrack and the voice acting are still on point. Animators still favor having a lot of action happening at once in both foreground and background, so every shot feels alive and complete, and there's a small but meaningful amount of relationships being developed and furthered throughout the story.",1

It had a great story that was easy to understand and a little darker than the first. It was action the whole way through.",1

229,6.0,"I thought it was OK, but no more than that. The writing wasn't very much inspired. There were no amazing jokes, no good story twists and no exciting action sequences. The plot (Poh embarks on a mission to both discover who are his real parents and defeat the inventor of gunpowder, which would make Kung Fu obsolete) unfolded exactly as we expected, but it unpredictably felt very slow at traits. The characters, although funny, are flat in a way that Pixar characters never are. Tigress is perhaps the most disappointing with some 10 lines in total (With so little, she is not even a supporting character: just a dramatic trick for making the story advance.) Poh's traditional laziness seems a bit of an old joke here. The visuals are however beautiful, and the idea of showing Poh's faded memories in 2D is quite cool.",0

233,8.0,"As a whole, the story continued the style of Kung Fu comedy + cute panda of the first ""Kung Fu Panda""; the script may be a little weak compared with the last one, but still a masterpiece. Po the panda understood the importance of self-confidence in the last movie, and in this one he realized the Eastern philosophy of Conquering the Unyielding with the Yielding.

It had its comedic relief moments, but the way the story was told was beautiful, really. Po's story comes to life before your eyes, and you can't help but cry a little when you discover what happened when he was only a child. Gary Oldmen was probably the best voice-actor in the movie. He did such a wonderful job of capturing Lord Shen, and I was captivated in every scene he was in. Jack Black adjusted well to the panda he was playing as, and his voicing improved greatly.",1

252,10.0,"Jack Black returns as the voice of mighty martial-arts panda Po in 'Kung Fu Panda 2', the sequel to that 2008 animated gem. After establishing himself as the Dragon Warrior by vanquishing the evil Tai Lung and retrieving the Dragon Scroll in the earlier film, the new adventure involves Po's search for his identity, and his quest for inner peace. He's pitted against an evil peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who killed his parents when he was a baby, and who is now threatening to conquer China using a fiery canon that will all but end the ancient art of kung fu. Naturally Po's accomplices in this showdown against Lord Shen are the members of the Furious Five, and much of the fun and inventiveness of this film comes from the teamwork between them. Po himself is the star of the show, and those who enjoyed the earlier film will be happy to know there are still plenty of jokes about Po being fat, lazy and constantly hungry. In fact, the very first time we see him in this film, he's accepted a challenge to stuff 40 buns in his mouth. The action scenes are bigger and better than the last time, and the animation itself is exceptional in terms of textures and lighting. Flashback sequences unfold in rich, comic-book style, and a climatic sequence in which Po dodges deadly canon-balls is the most visually arresting set-piece you've seen in an animation film recently. But 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is also a film with heart. There are touching scenes between Po and his adoptive father, and an important message in the end: that inner peace can be attained only by confronting the past, then letting go of it. A very worthy sequel to the first film, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is a treat for animation lovers. I'm going with three-and-a-half out of five for this return to awesomeness!",1

This movie has what ever you loved from the first film and you're expecting in the sequel despite other sequels.

A strong point of this film is that it's not all about Po and his stomach, we get to some touching stories about Po's past and other masters of Kung Fu . After that as a point of weakness of this title we don't see other characters much like the first film. Over all , this film has all there is to give an adult or a child a great time . Memorable quotes , cool battles , good storyline and lots of laughs !",1

260,10.0,"If you saw my other review for Kung Fu Panda, you would know that not only was Kung Fu Panda a surprising film, it was an overall great film for all ages. I still love the original KFP. So much so that I was pumped for KFP2. Then the trailers came out and I was getting a bad feeling with them. The first teaser with the staring contest is great but the actual trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure what it was, but I think the trailer made the movie seem way more focused on comedy than anything else. That would be a problem because KFP1 did a great job at being more than a comedy. Regardless, I want to see it anyway, and oh my god! This movie is not only as good as the first but its even better. Everything is stepped up to the next level. The story, the characters, & the villain are all stepped up from the first. The movie goes for 2 acts and its great, but at the end of the second act something happens, and the entire way I saw this series changed. The third act in this movie is something you have to see to be believed. If you don't know, this movie gets extremely emotional and legitimately sad to the point of tears for me. I know it sounds so strange that a movie about a kung Fu fighting panda made me cry. But that's the biggest strength to these movies. They are so much more than just that. I'm not the only one who cried either. The group I was in when I saw it were crying as well as most of the audience. They're are not very many sequels as good as Kung Fu Panda 2! If there is a gripe I would say it isn't as funny as the first. Considering the rest of the movie, that's an extremely small complaint. Its a film that moved me to tears and a film that may be the most surprisingly moving film I've ever seem. Again considering the movie is called Kung Fu Panda 2 staring jack black.",1
261,8.0,"Although it certainly did seem that passing the reins over to rookie director Jennifer Yuh was bewildering, but Yuh turned out to be perfect in guiding the sequel and the beloved characters in yet another adventure, with bigger set action pieces, touching dramatic moments, and retaining plenty of humour from the get go. Credit of course must go to writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger in coming up with a natural progression of the story of Po (Jack Black), and filling it with a lot more elements from classic martial arts film formulas such as a jail break involving skilled pugilists in captivity, a pagoda, getting beat down, recovery and recuperation, and the learning of a new, ultimate skill. To think that the worries came from the scribes being responsible for the snooze-fest Monsters Vs Aliens, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.",1
262,8.0,"I thought the first Kung Fu Panda was really cute and it likened to the first Shrek - this one was even better. The storyline was darker and it was definitely more violent than the first (maybe a little too much for little ones) but I really enjoyed it and laughed out loud and cried more than once. There were just enough clever one-liners for it to be cute without overdoing it, and there was just enough meat to the plot to interest kids and adults without it being boring. I also think Po was less Jack Black as a talking panda and more of a character on his own. I went to see this at the el cheapo theater one day in the middle of the week and it was the perfect way to spend a hot summer afternoon.",1
263,9.0,"Kung Fu Panda was released in 2008 and marked a dramatic shift in focus for Dreamworks Animation. The pop culture and childish humour of the likes of Shrek, Shark Tale and Over The Hedge was replaced with a more measured approach that while still had some childish humour was considerably more intelligent and deeper than most of Dreamwork's other films. The first film was a turning point I believe for the company in making animations that the industry could take more seriously. Then last year How To Train Your Dragon appeared at cinemas and I will admit that I preferred it to Toy Story 3 (probably the first time I can truly say I have enjoyed a Dreamworks feature more than one by Pixar). How To Train Your Dragon was deep, well-written but also fun, enjoyable to watch and all the childish humour had gone. It didn't talk down or sink low to entertain children just like most of Pixar's films. The animation was beautiful to behold and the music provided by John Powell was incredible using a mostly orchestral score with the visuals taking you on a fantastic journey as a young boy becomes a man in a way that only he can in bonding with an elusive dragon. It set a new standard for Dreamworks with the only other film I enjoyed as much was the co-production with Aardman on Wallice & Gromit: The Curse of the Ware-Rabbit.",1
264,8.0,With the success of Kung Fu Panda Dream Works finally managed to surpass Pixar with it's heavily detailed and achingly beautiful animation.,1
265,8.0,"Let me start by saying that while i enjoyed the first Kung Fu Panda (7/10), i cant say its a classic or a masterpiece.",1
266,10.0,"""Return of the Awesomeness."" It was indeed the return of the awesomeness. First Kung Fu Panda was really damn good. They had good characters, good story and of course good humor. So, what do you expect in the sequel of the film? It really lived to it's tag line though it didn't lived my expectations because it went BEYOND. The story follows the dragon warrior - Po and the furious five; Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey in their journey trying to save Kung Fu from the evil Lord Shen - who invented a new weapon that could end Kung Fu. The evil lord returned in making his plan into a reality with the help of this new weapon to end kung fu and conquer China after being banished by his father. Then later, Po realizes that the evil lord may or may have not done something in his missing childhood memories and he began to question himself 'Who is he?' I don't wanna spoil so better watch it. Kudos to the whole team behind this movie. I loved how they put a very good sense of humor. Plus, the comedic timing of everyone was great! And you can see that the characters really matured especially Po. Casting of the voices in the new characters were great too. And the I liked the fact that in some scenes you can't feel it 3D - unless you want it 3D the whole time and regretting it later for the soring of your eyes. They really did a good job on the effects, animations and colors were freaking great! it's 10 over 10 movie for me :)",1
267,7.0,"Having watched ""Kung Fu Panda (KFP-1)"" so many times and having fallen in love with those characters and humor again and again, the expectations were just so high for ""Kung Fu Panda 2 (KFP-2)"" when I watched it, and which it slightly fell short of. The IMDb ratings don't tell the real story. Ratings are high because the movie was visually spectacular. Agreed. Awesomenss in 3D! But as a movie, is it watchable as many times as the first part? And that, time can only tell.",1
268,8.0,"Kung-Fu panda 2 just amazes the viewers through out all cinemas. Just when you think that every sequel you watch will amount to little compared to the very first, Kung-Fu panda comes out with an entertaining and hilarious movie which had me rolling in the aisles. ",1
269,,"I fast forwarded ... i think 5 times. I'm not even exactly sure why. It's boring. Kung Fu Panda 1 was great ! , original, funny, even very nice action scenes. oh, and good graphics & music. ",0
270,8.0,Here's my review of the Movie Kun-Fu Panda 2.,0
271,6.0,"1. It seems first Shen wanted to weaponized fireworks because he was power hungry to conquer China as he was a evil psychopath, his parents was worried about him because of his evil nature and tried to kill all pandas too make sure the prophecy about a warrior of black and white as pandas would stop him to conquer China wouldn't come true, but other source says Shen wanted weaponized fireworks to impress his parents and business of Gongmen City at first. How can Shen become power hungry to conquer China because he wanted to weaponized fireworks or his parents exiled him who had nothing to do with China, kill all pandas if Shen didn't want to conquer China at first and believe his parents would be proud of him for killing all pandas and conquer China when they weren't even evil too and even let his cannon crush him if he want to conquer China anyway? Shen would at least get his will to conquer over a kingdom since he was at least a prince who are the only heir after his parents to conquer over their own kingdom, usually royalties who have and are jealous of their older siblings who are the next to rule over their kingdoms and advisers who dislike their job or never get any praise and honor, become power hungry and will only conquer over their own kingdom instead of entire country or the world that have nothing to with them. How could Shen believe his parent would be proud of him to weaponized firework and conquer China if his parent weren't evil too? Would Shen want to take revenge on his parents? It were his parents who banished Shen because he want to conquer China and massacred pandas, but why did Shen still want to seek revenge when his parents was nevertheless died before his return?",0
272,9.0,"Yes I was the only grown man sat in the 10:40am showing of this film on my own. And yes I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was more of the same fun from the first film but progressed a little bit more with character background, a simple cultural story, and plenty of action. And it wasn't just these points I enjoyed, it was the general 'feel' of the film as a beautifully crafted homage to a few Chinese animated stylings. Voices were once again perfect for each character, with special note towards Gary Oldman and Danny McBride. Music was as fantastical as the animation and really builds the film as an excellent artistically entertaining piece. A superb sequel that other sequels should take note of. I left the theatre feeling both satisfied and elated, wanting just that little more of the film. And yes that does mean I would like to see one more Kung Fu Panda sequel.",1
273,10.0,"Everything about this movie is excellent. It beats out an already great first film. Better villain, better story, and a great origin story for our main character. The same excellent voice acting from the first film is here with some new excellent voices, especially Gary Oldman as Shen. An excellent movie that I will always have a soft spot for.",1
274,9.0,"Awesome film, not only dose it build of the first film but adds new prospective to pos story. Won't spoil much but has a very mennising and has a well built cherecter. The fact that they ballence so many different feelings on a few cherecters is remarkable. The story isn't only the thing worth watching for, the action is some of the best I've seen in all animation. The red esthetic every time villans are on screen adds so much more tension then it eould of had. The movie doesn't baby the audience either, it is a dark story about losing what you love and revenge. I also don't feel like anybody in the movie has plot armor, every scene I feel like the cherecters could meet their end.",1
275,9.0,"When my friends and I discussed plans for after our last day of school, we eventually settled on seeing Kung Fu Panda 2. Having never seen the original Kung Fu Panda, I decided to watch it a few nights before and loved its great performances, excellent animation, and powerful moral. As i went into Kung Fu Panda 2, however, I remembered: this is a Dreamworks movie. Can this really measure up to the first movie? Answer: I need not have worried.",1
276,9.0,I've always thought that Dreamworks productions are always 1 step behind Pixar. But Kung Fu Panda (2008) has proved me wrong.,1
277,8.0,"The animation in here is a work of a genius. The movie never falls short to tickle your funny bone. This is one of the sequels which is equally enjoyable as the original one. The addition of croc and ox are not that a good addition but since they do not have much screen time you'll never get bored. The voice overs are perfectly in sync with the animation and the emotions. Jack Black's voice over as PO is fantastic. He will make you love Po enough that you would want to watch the movie again. Over and all an excellent choice for a move worth watching with the entire family. For anybody too fond of animations, this movie is a MUST!",1
278,9.0,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I can't write a verbose review but I have to do 10 lines to meet guidelines here. To put it simply, I think this movie may be better than the first, which I enjoyed. My 9 year old loved it. But to my surprise, my 18 year old who tagged along with us thought it was great too! A tiny bit slow to start or it would have gotten a 10. Within 20 minutes it was hopping. Made me laugh pretty often. Sappy me, had tears in my eyes at the end. The colors and animation were a delight. The comic delivery from Jack Black came at just the right times. I'm not sure how I'd feel about a 3rd which they left the door open for. I think this ended on just the right note.",1
279,10.0,"If you liked Kung Fu Panda #1, you will love #2. With the exception of a little bit of a cryptic ending, the story is perfection. It's also the kind of movie that will make you want to run out and buy a blu-ray if you don't already own one. The detail in every scene is just mind-blowing. It's also my 4 yr old's favourite movie. He's watched it about 40 times. And no, it's no too scary for that age. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is probably a helicopter parent who bubble wraps their kids at night. Yes, there is fighting.. but hey, it's 'kung fu!' - I mean that in a fun way. It's 'good' vs 'bad' and there's no blood. I watched much scarier movies that Disney put out when I was a kid, and me and my whole generation grew up just fine. So get the family together and enjoy it, I guarantee you'll want to clap and cheer by the end!",1
280,10.0,Watched this movie in 3D with my friends and had a great experience. The 3D effects are fantastic along with the movie. The storyline is awesome and has furthered my experience of watching this movie.,1
281,10.0,"I have read all the negative reviews about this film, and I am happy to say they are all dead wrong.",0
282,9.0,"To be honest, I've always like the sequel to every single Dreamworks movie that had a sequel more than the original. For example, as much as I loved Shrek, I loved Shrek 2 more. I hated Madagascar but found Madagascar 2 pretty enjoyable to watch. And it's no exception that I actually liked Kung Fu Panda 2 more than Kung Fu Panda (which I thought that although it was good, it was a tad bit overrated).",1
283,,This movie was just fabulous.I saw Kung Fu panda and badly wanted to watch the second part and this movie was even better than the first one.It had a nice mix of laughter and action.,0
284,8.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of the first Kung Fu Panda. The villain was cool, the acting was good, and the animation and music was awesome (Dreamworks always seems to manage that). But it was just a plain stupid movie. It really was.",0
285,9.0,When I watched the first movie it immediately became one of my favorite so I was both excited as well as afraid of watching the second part cause it could have spoiled the original one for me. Thanks to dreamworks it didn't and i laughed my heart out watching it.,1
286,9.0,"Star Wars. X-Men. Indiana Jones. Lord of the Rings. Kung Fu Panda. What do all these things have in common? Well probably a lot of things, actually. But here is my point. All of the first films in these franchises were good, if not great, films. But it doesn't end there. Also, in all of these films, the actors came back, having grown into their characters, and delivered a second film that was not only up to par with the first, but also delivered something extra. Story and emotion. In all of these film franchises, the second film carries a powerful message, and strong emotion. Luke and Vader's relationship becomes clear. Wolverine learns of his past. Indy has his life saved by the least likely person imaginable. A small army of men put their lives literally on the line at Helm's Deep to fight the forces of evil.",1
287,7.0,"well,well...not bad. But something not wright...Impression,originality,laugh,enthusiasm at part one...well, just not same. Everything of this is still there, but somehow, maybe just a little less then before, but enough to feel difference comparing those two parts of magnificent Panda and his crew...maybe it is just me, but do not get me wrong, magic is still there, art is still there, cuteness is still there and part 2 is very, very watchable, more then enough to spend your time watching it and for sure you wont be sorry because you did. Only, you not gonna be so happy as first time leaving the movie theater...you know as they say, first kiss is always the one you remember forever, everything else is just second one...7.5/10",1
288,,"Oh, it's so on. After a less than spectacular beginning to animation and still having the occasional misstep, Dreamworks has put themselves in direct competition with Pixar. While Fox Animation Studios continues to be unsuccessful in their attempts, and with Blue Sky Studios being even worse (they insist on hanging onto the irksome Ice Age franchise), Dreamworks animation has put itself on pace to being nearly as good as Pixar. ",0
289,6.0,"I liked Kung Fu Panda 2 because it has very nice fight moves, and I liked seeing Po hit Shen -- I was very happy.",1
290,10.0,"""Your story may not have a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story, who you choose to be."" KFP2 is a combination of human spirituality and a brilliant touch of humor; which is very hard to come by. The story maybe not as original as the first movie but more enthusiastic and entertaining; and above all, the animation are flawless with lots of scintillating Kung Fu action. ",1
291,8.0,"This movie was greatly film and a good sequel. From 1 hour and half short length time, the animation, plot,art, scores and character development just better than I expect that gave me a teary eyes in the end and show us meaning of family and love. The soundtrack composed by John Powell and Hans Zimmer made it extraordinary and best thing I've heard. Show us behind the music of Chinese instrument that made it...godly. I'd prefer this than the 1st movie, it gave me a lot of feels and relate to me at some point and the villain is very unique I love it, and thing that made the character a-bit mature, especially Po in this film. They were few laughs. After I get out of the cinema, it had me good vibes around me, it inspired me, it was a really good movie.",1
