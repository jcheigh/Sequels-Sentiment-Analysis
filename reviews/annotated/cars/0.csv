0,8.0,"""Cars didn't ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time."" ",1
1,8.0,"Pixar again shows us their superior skills in 3D animation and to a lesser extent this time, the storytelling. There is so much attention to detail, that you are left gazing at the screen in awe. The 2 hours races by, and afterwards you are left with the satisfaction of having just seen something quite unique and surreal.",1
2,9.0,"This is EASILY the movie I've watched most in my life. Back when I was young, I would have this on repeat. My parents said I used to HAVE to watch this movie every day for a certain period of time or I would get mad. Well, until now, I hadn't seen it in like 6 years until now. It was just as I remember, and extremely nostalgic. I can't be bothered to wonder why this movie gets the hate that it does. In fact, it's one of the best Pixar films. Idk if the nostalgia is blinding me, but for me this was (so far) one of the better Pixar films. A great character arc for Lightning McQueen, an amazing redemption for Radiator Springs, just a magical movie. I will forever hold this movie close to me and never let go. Imo, this is one of THE movies.",1
3,8.0,"There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.",1
4,9.0,"People do have their own opinions but there is one thing I came across with, why do some people don't like this movie? I've seen when it came out in 2006 and loved it and I think its better then its sequel, in my opinion. Is because of the world of talking cars? Disney has created many films were animals talk, look at the Mickey Mouse cartoons, there is no people in there world, minus the ones during the early years of Disney. ",1
5,10.0,"Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes.""",1
6,8.0,"As usual, you've gotta hand it to Pixar.",0
7,10.0,"I saw this film on May 31st, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.",1
8,10.0,"upon entering the theater I wasn't expecting anything wow and big from pixar since the last few movies they made really didn't hit it off with me. But I Love ""Cars""!! its the best movie that pixar has created in a long long time. Not since the early days of ""Toy Story"" have I enjoyed a Pixar movie so much that I wanted to write a comment about it. This movie is fantastic! It has everything you could ever want in a movie plus a whole lot more. The team over at Pixar really went over and beyond with this movie and all that hard work really shows.although the gags references and storyline are more for the adults than the kids, I still would recommend this movie to absolutely everybody. 10++++",1
9,7.0,"I found this movie to be enjoyable enough: Even when it is true that it wasn't at the same level than some of previous Pixar films (Such as ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"") it was a good film anyway, with an entertaining story and likable characters.",1
10,10.0,But WHY is it great?,1
11,10.0,"I think if this film was released today it would have done better with the critics. It didn't do badly in 2006 but there was a lot of people complaining that it was Pixar's first flawed film and that it was a little bet too rote. That was my original impression as well. The film plays like a family version of Doc Hollywood mixed with a sports coming of age story. What the story is doing is rather basic, conventional but it does it do it well. The animation is very beautiful and the film really captures American Car culture c. 1955 and Old Route 66. The characters are a collection of stock characters-Mater is a hick, Fillmore a hippie, etc.-but they are fully realized stock characters with a perfect voice cast. I can understand why someone would be rather cool on the film. I was back in 2006.",1
12,8.0,"Pixar just keeps hitting them out of the park. Larry the cable guy was a great cast as Mater. Owen Wilson as Lightining was another great decision for the makers of Cars. There is never a dull moment while watching this film. I guess that is obvious by the overwhelming success at the box office. Working at a movie theater I get to see the reactions of our patrons after seeing each film we show; Cars is a must see this summer. There are very few genuine family movies released now a days, this is a clean movie that families can come together and enjoy without worrying about having to screen the film before bringing the kids. I recommend everyone go see this film and then go see it again.",1
13,10.0,I had my doubts. I knew that Pixar would fail this time around. No way were they going to pull this off for a seventh time.,1
14,,"I read a write-up about Cars several months ago, so I was vaguely aware of it when a friend suggested we go see it today. I had no idea where the plot would lead, but figured a Pixar film was a good bet.",1
15,10.0,"Being a petrolhead, this pixar movie is perfect. Is emotional, is about enjoy the ride and at the same time about nascar. Yes, car people will like more.",1
16,8.0,"Still the first one is the best to watch. I have seen it several times. Every time I go to Little Cano to change the tires quickly, the maintenance team next door is all shocked. Then McQueen gives up the championship and pushes the car king. I was in tears! There are always more important things in life than fame and fortune. Good emotions are the most worthwhile things to spread and flood. I hope the world can always have love like this ~ really good ~",1
17,,"I'm a man (71). I took my son (40) and my granddaughter (10) to see ""Cars"". It was wonderful exciting entertainment for all our ages. I grew up with the old cars and have traveled Route 66 a few times so I was able to relate to the story and talk about the old times after the movie with the younger kids. My son and his daughter love NASCAR so they got a lot from the movie. The scenery though computer modified and generated was beautiful and true to the area portrayed. There is so much going on that this is one movie I want to see again. I have more grandkids, I think I'll have a valid excuse to go once more. Please!, if you see this movie remain seated until the very end of the credits, you are in for a treat.",1
18,9.0,"I thought the story looked very lame from previews, and the concept didn't appeal to me. But when I saw an early screening I was surprised, it was well written and well executed. They didn't overload the movie with automotive jokes, which I think would have hurt the story and character development. Owen Wilson's voice is great for his role. Overall, it's on par with other Pixar films, even if it may not be their best so far. The animation is superb, definitely the best they've done. Giving something like cars distinct personality and characterization seems like it would be pretty tough, and they do a great job with it. See this movie the day it opens.",1
19,8.0,"Lightning McQueen is an arrogant rookie race car and his main goal is to win the Piston Cup Championship, were he could have fame, fortune, and a new sponsorship in Dinoco. Being one of the three favorites and on the way to the decisive race in Los Angeles,McQueen gets lost in his way and ends up in Radiator Springs, a very small and lost city. As he destroyed many things from the city, included the road, he is sentenced to community service by Doc Hudson, the local judge. Needing to repair the road and with few days available until the decisive race, McQueen will need to do his best. But during his time in the city, he will know better the other habitants and learn very important life lessons.",1
20,8.0,"While traveling to California for the dispute of the final race of the Piston Cup against The King and Chick Hicks, the famous Lightning McQueen accidentally damages the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. Lightning McQueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals, changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner.",1
21,9.0,But WHY is it great?,1
22,7.0,"Originally published on June 6, 2006.",0
23,10.0,"When I first heard about ""Cars"" I wasn't too anxious to see it because I'm not a Nascar fan at all, and I thought the movie was just going to be all about car racing.",1
24,8.0,"I, like most fans of Pixar studios, felt my heart sink when I saw the first preview for ""Cars"" when it ran in front of ""The Incredibles"" in 2004. There had been previews of other Pixar movies that left me underwhelmed, but this was the first one that looked...well...bad. The constant shots of racing cars, the frenzied editing, the apparent belief that the phrase ""dadgum"" was funny in and of itself...it just looked like Pixar had come up with their first stinker. I am so glad, no...ecstatic, to say my first instincts were wrong. ""Cars"" has every bit of the Pixar spirit at its core.",0
25,8.0,"Animated films are not my favorite genre and I am not a Nascar fan. I anticipated that I would reflect on the 2 hours in a movie theater as quality family time rather than quality entertainment but this movie had me hooked from the beginning. My kids did not have my background to understand Route 66 history but they didn't need it. The loved the film for other reasons. I lived in small towns where a day is fueled with hope of what might come over the horizon. I have actually been cow tipping and laughed at the tractor scenes. I really appreciate the part of the theme of a successful member of a younger generation listening to and profiting by the wisdom of someone older. Far too many children's shows revolve around a plot with stupid adults and the youth needing to save the world. This film perhaps restored, for me, a little faith in our entertainment industry. This is one movie the whole family really can enjoy. See this movie if for no other reason than to support the production of this type of message.",1
26,6.0,"when Pixar announced their idea for ""Cars"" (a world exactly like our own but inhabited by living cars instead of humans), I thought that the film was going to be an instant failure. Then, as the images of the new graphics and the plot outlines started to came out I was still unimpressed by them, seeing at how unoriginal the plot was and how everything seemed to be aiming for showing off their technical progress, my hopes for ""Cars"" were really low. I guess that's why I ended up liking it so much.",0
27,10.0,"This movie is truly another hit from PIXAR. It's wonderful story, charming characters, and great animation for it's time brings this movie to be just as creative as PIXAR's First Movie Toy Story. Who knew in 11 years from then, we would get this remarkable computer-animated classic. Thank you PIXAR for giving us the true action-adventure thrilling feel of Cars. Still awesome to this day. PIXAR Scale: 10/10",1
28,5.0,"As Pixar, Blue Sky and DreamWorks continue to tick off the list of cute cuddly animals to make films about, director John Lasseter and Joe Ranft (the latter sadly and ironically died in a car crash last year) brings us a story about cars in incongruous human setting. Nine years of hard work in combining Lasseter's two great interests, cars and animation, finally gives us a satisfying end product but regrettably 'Cars' is just that. Satisfactory and utterly charmless.",1
29,8.0,"This is an amusing film about cars. That cars are the subject and main ingredient is to say that icing on a cake is mere frosting. This is Disney's tribute to racing legends, enthusiasts, pit crews and aficionados animated to instill human viewers with worthy traits about living, learning and competing in and out of the fast lane. Within the speedy story is a moral obligation about achievements, success, honor and respect in general. How one is treated and vice versa, how we treat others, even if we are made of metal. Each of the autos in the film ""CARS"" has a unique identity and is brought to life by a plethora of legendary voices. Consider for example names like Paul Newman as 'Doc Hudson', Michael Keaton as 'Chick Hicks', Cheech Marin as 'Ramone' and Jay Leno as 'Jay Limo' lines the star studded film with superb talent. Added to them are legendary racing names like, Dale Earnhardt Jr, and Richard Petty and of course Owen Wilson as the voice of Lightening McQueen. The result is nothing short of a fabulous tale, creating an endearing worthwhile film for the entire family. ****",1
30,9.0,"Man, I cannot believe Pixar. I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do. Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help. However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.",1
31,10.0,"With as many phenomenal films on their resume as Pixar has, it is hard to believe that they can keep up the level of quality one film after another, and if you are waiting to see what will be the film that will be the first stumble from them, keep waiting because Cars is not it. Just when you think they must be running out of ideas by now, they come out with something like this and it blows me away every time. I watched Cars having never heard anything about it beyond the not very informative billboards that are plastered all over Los Angeles. ",0
32,8.0,"Let me just start by saying that CARS to me was wonderful but I did enjoy FINDING NEMO better. I have yet to watch THE INCREDIBLES (I'm slow sometimes) so I can't really compare this one to that one. Lightning McQueen is a racing car. During one of these races there is a three way tie. The officials decide that Lightning and the other two cars involved (Chick Hicks and The King) will battle it out in a race in California. Los Angeles to be precise. Mack, the truck who is bringing him to Cali, dozes off while moving along while Lightning is asleep in the trailer. That's when four street cars (think THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS) sneak up and have some fun with Mack. This fun causes him to go over in the lane with all the grates in the road to wake you up and let you know what's going on. The bumps cause something to fall off a shelf in the trailer and hit a lever that makes the door open. Lightning rolls out (still asleep) into the middle of the highway. From there on, he rolls his way (or should I say ""Speeds""?) into RADIATOR SPRINGS, a town on the outskirts of a major interstate that everyone seems to have forgotten. Everyone except the few cars that still live there and call it home. Anyway, I will stop right there before I give away the whole movie. This movie boasts awe aspiring, lush animation that can only be done by Pixar. But, like I said, I liked FINDING NEMO better. That's not to say don't watch this movie because it sure is a delight.",1
33,9.0,"I went to the premier of ""Cars"" last night at the Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concorde and was delighted to find that the hours of traffic were worth it. ",0
34,8.0,"For the first half hour or so of the movie, all I could think to myself was, ""Damn, Pixar might be in trouble here."" For some reason, I just could not get into it at the beginning. The whole thing with having cars as characters just didn't sit well with me, the story wasn't engaging and I couldn't shake the feeling like Pixar had finally dropped the ball with this one. The streak had gone long enough and Pixar had struck out after a long line of animated classics.",0
35,9.0,"A friend told me he saw ""Cars"" and the references to NASCAR escaped him since he's not a fan.Still,he said he enjoyed it due to the great animation and story.I'm happy to say so did we. Even though the theater was uncomfortable, soon the movie grew on me and when Mater made his appearance,I was ""hooked"". The voice talents really made this a stand-out,in my opinion.Larry the Cable Guy (Mater)and Paul Newman (Doc Hudson) were my favorites.I don't know if it was intentional when Doc Hudson asked Lightning McQueen: ""When is the last time you cared about anything other than yourself?"" In case you don't know about Paul Newman, he is a caring and supremely generous man, and the founder of ""Newman's Own"" a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which he has donated to charity. Finally,the message about taking the scenic route made this a memorable experience.",1
36,9.0,"The plot of this movie is a lot like Doc Hollywood starring Michael J. Fox. A ""Big City"" hotshot on his way to LA finds himself stuck in a small hick town and endures a miserable week of volunteer work all the while falling in love with the town's comfortable feeling and quirky but genuine inhabitants. How can anyone not love this film? From the hilarious and laid back Owen Wilson to the gritty and serious Paul Newman, this film is full of strong characters including the smaller roles (Michael Keaton!). It's funny, charming and heartfelt and full of great tunes as well. Just the opening sequence alone will have you tapping your feet to Sheryl Crow and the end may bring tears when you hear Brad Paisley. My husband and i are in our 30s and we adore this film. Always crack up when I hear the line ""Im in Hillbilly Hell! My IQ is dropping by the second!""",1
37,9.0,"A classic childhood film, not loved by many as much as other Pixar classics for reasons I am still yet to undestand. This film is brilliant, I am just as nostalgic for this as I am Toy Story or even UP, though I do prefer those two, but only by a small way. Cars was great, why they made the below average Cars 2&3 I don't know.",1
38,10.0,"Pixar has the difficult obligation of bettering itself with each subsequent movie in order to please their fans. With instant classics in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the Pixar standards are set high. I wondered how Pixar could take the concept of talking cars into an entertaining film and original story and characters, especially considering the studio's standards.",1
39,10.0,"You really can't grasp the full story until you've visited Historic Rt. 66! The authenticity of the scenery, the stores, the cars, the subtleties, everything, is awesome. You'll really get a kick out of this movie if do get your kicks on Rt. 66! Lots of fun! I highly recommend it. After watching it for the 4th time, it's gone to the of my favorite movie list!",1
40,9.0,"The latest Disney/Pixar epic, ""Cars"" is yet another brilliant work. The story takes place in a world populated completely by living motorized vehicles. The main character is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a rookie race car with dreams of winning the Piston Cup. When he is on his way to the big race in California, he gets sidetracked in a little town called Radiator Springs, along Route 66. The story is filled with colorful characters, from Mater, a rusty good ol' boy tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, to Doc Hudson, the town judge/mechanic, and former Piston Cup champion, voiced by Paul Newman. Pixar once again makes clever casting choices, including several personalities from the world of stock car racing: Darrell Waltrip, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Racing legend Richard Petty voices ""The King,"" Strip Weathers. Even Paul Newman is a racing enthusiast! The imagery is as breathtaking as always, from the shapes in the desert around Radiator Springs, to the dizzying, exciting action shots at the race sequences. Score another victory for Disney and Pixar!",1
41,10.0,A great movie from 2006 this is when we met Lightning Mcqueen one of my favorite characters from the cars franchise and Mater one of Lightning Mcqueen's best friends despite the fact that he became a superficial character in the sequel.,1
42,6.0,"In a world inhabited by locomotion machines and cars, the little abandoned town of Radiator Spring languishes until it receives the visit of a posh race car, Lightning McQueen. His stop and meeting of the old- style cars living there will change his perspective on life and on what he wants to achieve.",1
43,,"Steve Jobs, we're gonna miss you in the movie creation business.",0
44,9.0,"I can't believe the negative comments about this movie. I agree that the story is a little familiar, but the humor for adults in this is so wonderful--it's a pleasure to watch and try and catch all of the sly references (and not just pop culture things) and wonderful visual images. **POSSIBLE SPOILERS**I was amazed with the desert scenes and all of the buttes and mountains shown as car hoods and fenders, the old hotel entrance in a wheel. I loved how Ramone had a new paint job every time he came on scene. I loved Luigi's Ferrari mania and when Michael Schumacher came in at the end...perfect humor. And I haven't laughed so hard in a movie in a long time as I did in the ""tractor tipping"" scene. And if you are a fan of movie soundtracks, do yourself a favor and buy this one........",1
45,7.0,"As pretty much noted by everyone who has seen it, Cars is visually stunning but unable to live up to the narrative standards set by previous Pixar big hitters. But mid tier Pixar is still better than most other animation offerings from other stables. Plot simply finds arrogant race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) about to hit super star status, only to suffer a highway crash that leaves him stranded in a ghost town called Radiator Springs. A once thriving town, Radiator Springs is now only home to the loyal locals and very much a product of an era long since gone. Forced to stay due to community service, Lightning is desperate to leave the place he calls ""Hillbilly Hell"", but as he comes to know the people of the town he comes to find a new perspective on things.",1
46,7.0,"Don't get me wrong, Cars is a good movie, it's just that it isn't a great one. Personally I do think it is my least favourite Pixar movie, but there was still a lot I enjoyed. So what were its problems? Well, firstly I felt the narrative was a little too slack and sedate particularly in the middle act. Secondly, while there were some nice jokes, some didn't quite work and the script had its weak spots, could've done with more sophistication. Thirdly, the film's message is a little muddled.",0
47,,"'Cars' blew me away with it's fun-feel. I've always liked Pizar's animation and 'Cars' doesn't disappoint one bit. The animation is stunning and the colourful characters are very cute, vivacious and extremely lovable. Even the setting is spectacular. The story, though not exactly 'new' (but has a slightly expected ending), is very heartwarming and makes me smile. 'Got to give Lasseter credit for telling the story and adding the subtle humour. The voice actor features talents like Bonnie Hunt (great to see, I mean hear her after a long time), Paul Newman, Owen Wilson among many others and have been suitably 'cast'.",1
48,9.0,"A delightful animated romp made by Pixar and Disney. It is filled with talented voice performances by Owen Wilson and Paul Newman. A little slow to start, Lightning finds himself in a three-way tie with two other racers to win the coveted Piston Cup. After a comical tragedy leaving Lightning in a small town on route 66 he begins an emotional odyssey. He finds help from the locals in his search for true happiness.",1
49,7.0,"After the eco-friendly murmurisms of Over The Hedge, the genius behind Toy Story offers up a fable about a world dominated by cars. Those noisy little things that, along with TV and fast food, stopped everyone from walking. The visuals are fab, the jokes somewhat drab but the racing is top notch pixar. Even when they aren't quite on form, it is hard to fault what they do best.",1
50,8.0,"Without giving away any of the story, here's my take. I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the ""original"", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the ""Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies"" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.",1
51,9.0,"I was able to attend a premiere showing of this movie in North Carolina and was amazed again at how much more a movie can be than just ""animation."" This film focuses on a changed reality, a world where cars are the only life form and so we must suspend our own reality to enjoy this film. In the same flavor as the first Pixar films, we quickly accept a world where everything is a motorized vehicle that lives and acts like we do in our own world. The cars have experiences in life, desires that drive (sorry for that) them, and misunderstandings that are taken advantage of.",1

54,8.0,"Cars, like Toy Story, or A Bug's Life, or Finding Nemo, is just basically an Oscar winner. The animation is perfect (perfect to the little nibbles of dust). The story is classic and flawless. The emotions are definitely there. The Colors are oh-so-Techni! Owen Wilson is great as Lightning's voice artist (I recognized his familiar voice, not consciously knowing that it was him, although I think I did see his name somewhere before). There's a moral in the story. There are emotional moments. Funny moments. Romantic moments. Thrilling moments.",1
55,10.0,"Cars was a perfect way to celebrate Pixar's 20th Anniversary with great songs from Crush 40 especially Open Your Heart from Sonic Adventure those of my thoughts. Characters learn to appreciate one another's differences. Themes include humility and integrity. Some racial/ethnic stereotypes. Lightning learns the importance of appreciating the differences in everyone. The World of Cars was a fantastic idea especially when it's talking cars.

We were privvy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backroad to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun. Not only on the fact that he's a tow truck, but also his ""they call me tater salad"" bit-- Overall, highly entertaining, just try not to speed too much on the way home....",1

58,7.0,"The only problem with setting the bar so high is that then you are expected to always perform at that level. Pixar set the bar so high with some of its masterpieces that whenever they come out with an above-average animated film, its still ""disappointing"" because it's compared to its other brilliant creations. The Incredibles suffers from this, and so does Cars. But, just like The Incredibles, Cars is a superb tour-de-force that should entertain the entire family. From the beginning fun-filled race to the great ending, Cars is a technical achievement, visually appealing, and also contains a great message, one that does not seem forced unlike other animated movies. As a matter of fact, this is perhaps the best animated movie since Finding Nemo three years ago.",1
59,9.0,You know never in my wildest dreams would I see a company or a specific group of people shell such high quality entertainment in all my life. I have thought about long and hard and couldn't come up with a single reason not to love these movies. I think with each movie Pixar creates the greater the story tellers they become.,1
60,,"Absolutely wonderful animated feature that is arguably the finest of its type. In a world of human-like automobiles, one is at the threshold of super-stardom via his amazing racing skills. However he is brash, selfish and ignorant of others around him. It takes a crazed twist of fate to forever change him as he gets stuck in a small town just off the interstate and is forced to repair a street after unwittingly tearing it up. There he learns that sometimes the best thing to do is to slow down and enjoy the show that is life as he meets others who have been demoralized due to technologies and innovations that have all but killed their sleepy little community. ""Cars"" is a deep-thinking analytical glimpse into the losses that many have experienced due to gains by the world. Small-town values of love, friendship, sacrifice, caring for others and putting the well-being of a group above the well-being of one's self are the major elements found within. There are life lessons here aplenty that are not only valid for the youngest of age groups, but also for the most bitter and disenchanted of adults.

63,6.0,"Well I think that CARS was OK ,but very, very, very slow paced. Although some of it was good, some was not. The part where Lightning McQueen visited the city of Radiator Springs was good. Seeing a little town full of talking cars was fun. The movie was sort of interesting and was sort of boring. The boring part of the movie was in the beginning when Lightning McQueen was in the race and talking to the other race cars and when he got lost on the way to the final race. But I think all sorts of children will like it. However I do think this because as I was in the movie theater,in my seat the movie was starting and heard a few little kids yelling out saying:awesome or cool or just plain yelling. The movie was A-OK! And I would recommend the movie for youngsters and everyone over five years of age. I was very happy to watch the movie. and I would be even happy to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD.",0
64,10.0,"This movie was better than I expected. It had heart, and had some great lessons about learning to put others ahead of yourself and to think of others instead of being obsessed with getting attention for yourself. Not Disney's finest, but certainly a winner for me. The music was good as well, Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" and Rascal Flatts ""Life is a Highway"" set the mood for the film perfectly. I'm a fan of country music anyway, and of Rascal Flatts. I loved this two songs. I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD, so I can watch it endlessly. This ranks among my favorites for Disney/Pixar's films: 1. Cars, 2. Finding Nemo, 3. Toy Story 2, 4. Toy Story. All of these are excellent in animation and story. I even cried at parts of the story, especially when McQueen pushed The King to the finish line, and when Mater and McQueen were developing their close friendship. Also, when McQueen found out that being cared for (in more than just publicity) and caring about others was great. That really was what stood out to me. Great job, Disney and Pixar!",1

And the moral of the story is provided by the relationship of Speed Mcqueen the racer whose voice is Owen Wilson, and Doc Hudson whose voice is provided by Paul Newman. The moral can be summed up by the poet that wrote, ""No man is an island unto himself"".

I could not stop laughing for just one second without something else extremely funny happening in the film. This film is great! It's awesome!! There's hardly anything that is not funny in it. I'm telling you go see this movie, it's worth seeing and worth watching. Kids are not the only one's who will find this funny, grownups will too. So, when you have nothing to do, go to your local movie theater and go see this movie, I seriously doubt that you will NOT enjoy it.",1
71,9.0,I had the privilege of watching this movie AT the drive-in about 20 minutes from my home. (Yes there are still a few of them left)My wife and two kids watched every minute of this movie and loved it! The casting was perfect and the quality was super. As with most Disney/Pixar productions we forgot almost instantly that cars don't really talk. There were even some adult level jokes sprinkled in as is typical with Pixar. I was truly moved by the serious message that the movie sends about the need in our society to get where we are going in a hurry and thereby missing the truly great things in life. I would love to see this one again and again...Which I will probably be forced to once it's out on video!,1

73,9.0,"the theatre was filled mostly with small boys, jumping up and down trying to claim the 'best' seat until the film started. when it did, the small boys sat quite still eyes glued to the screen and jaws probably gaping. i'm guessing at that - my jaw was gaping anyway. the animation is 'right there' - you might not get the smell of the 'greasepit' but you do get the roar of the crowd. i had heard a reviewer say it had been a stretch to believe the cars as characters - not if you buy into it. it is entertainment, car culture, scenery reminiscent of Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner, action of all sorts, visual and verbal puns, and if you're not a race car fanatic, it is still really clever yet it has a loving touch. the small Pixar movie at the beginning is a treat as always. pay attention to the whole movie then sit through the end credits - the very end is worth it. there is a long-ish bit in the middle, perfect for a bathroom break, but boring to sit through and could have been shortened - otherwise, an excellent story and up to the Pixar standard (vroom-vroom!).",1

Cars was a real feel good story with a good message and pretty darn funny as well. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was particularly funny, even though I don't find his stand-up all that. Pixar has found a winning formula, they need only stick with it, and hopefully Disney doesn't continue to squeeze them.",0

77,9.0,"Cars (2006): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Larry the Cable Guy, Bonnie Hunt, Tony Shalhoub: From the creators of Toy Story and Monsters Inc comes this surprisingly imaginative computer animated film about cars. It is never explained why these vehicles sustain life but director John Lasseter succeeds in creating a story of wondrous images and virtue. Owen Wilson voices race car Lightning McQueen who serves time in Radiator Springs after a night of misfortune. He is sentenced to repair damage he caused but ultimately realizes that this rundown town was once a production for cars. He meets Doc voiced by Paul Newman who hides a past. Portia voiced by Bonnie Hunt teaches Lightning to slow down before he misses the important things in life. How two cars romance is something that is never attempted in an explanation here. There is also a rusty tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy who befriends Lightning and introduces him to a new version of cow tipping that is one of the funniest jokes. Tony Shalhoub voices Luigi, and Richard Cheech Marin voices a Chevy Impala named Ramone. The computer generated images bring the characters to life presenting glorious colour and accompanied by a screenplay that crosses the finish line. Strong theme regarding selflessness highlights this superb animated gem that wins more than a race. Score: 9 / 10",1

Unexpectedly, he's detoured to the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, somewhere off of the legendary Route 66. There, he discovers that life isn't all about trophies and living life in the fast lane. Some off-beat characters in the new Disney/Pixar computer animated film are Sally, a pristine 2002 baby blue Porsche (Bonnie Hunt), Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet (Paul Newman), Ramone, a 1959 Chevy Impala with as an East LA talking' low-rider (Cheech Marin) and Mater as in ""Tom Mater"" (get it?), a rusty hillbilly tow-truck (Larry the Cable Guy). The all-star cast also includes the voices of racing legends, Richard Petty and Mario Andretti, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. A casting coupe would've been adding Chong (hey, Cheech is already a voice in the movie) as Filmore, the peace-loving hippie Volkswagen bus.

You see, he knows how good he is, and he rarely misses an opportunity to brag. Lightning is in a three-way tie for this year's coveted Piston Cup, and he's determined to be the first rookie car to take the trophy. All that stands in his way are his two chief competitors.",1
84,8.0,"I was quite surprised to read a number of less-than glowing reviews of this film. But then, I realized that because ""Cars"" is really quite different from most of Pixar's previous fare, I can now understand it, in a way. When you look at the ""Toy Story"" movies, as well as ""A Bug's Life"", you see anthropomorphism, of course. In this one, it goes to a whole new level. This IS a universe of cars ... no people, no grounding in reality, as with ""Toy Story"", etc. Now this could have presented a real difficulty. As with LOTR and Narnia, you create a whole world at your peril; nevertheless, Pixar's ultra-creative staff pulled it off. The voice casting was superb, and I was particularly pleased with Paul Newman's and Bonnie Hunt's efforts. But in fact, everyone ""fleshed out"" their characters beautifully. Oh, and the animation was kicked up another level, too. The scenes of Monument Valley were breathtaking ... and finally, this movie is up another whole level thematically speaking. You have Pixar's usual ""what's really important in life"" theme, along with the usual ""learn to value friendship"" admonitions. Along with these, though, is a sly, carefully crafted message about living life in ""the slow lane,"" done in a way that made me want to plan a hip trip down Route 66. All in all, I've seldom been as moved, surprised and satisfied with a movie as I have been with this one. My only complaint? The story did sag a little in the middle ... something I've noticed again in several other Pixar efforts. However it wasn't a big sag, and things revved up fairly quickly. #Spoiler Alert# You'll never again pass a tractor sitting in a field without wanting to tip it!",1
85,5.0,"Leave it to Pixar Animation to do away with people and replace them with talking cars. The idea itself is impersonal, and the results (heavy with both talk and auto-slapstick) are distinctly disengaged--unless you're a 10-year-old boy or his auto-enthusiast father. Lightning McQueen, a hot-shot race-car and the rookie sensation of the year, lands in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup and must drive cross-country to California to compete in the championship. Along the way, he falls out of his transport truck (whose back door apparently goes down and back up without being noticed) and gets himself cited for recklessness in a dirt town named Radiator Springs. Having the hero of this story forced into doing community service may serve as an unsubtle lesson for kids to take it easy on the roads, but for an animated comedy it isn't very funny. Lightning's detour amongst the hicks--who keep him there against his will--proves to be the centerpiece of the plot! While the viewer waits for somebody to let out the emergency brake, the filmmakers go crazy with the buck-teeth satire. It's ""Hee Haw"" on wheels. ** from ****",0

It's classic strong Pixar writing. The amount of effort and passion put into this movie I feel like isn't recognised enough.

While not the masterpiece in tone and plotting that had distinguished this computer animation company's nearly flawless track record from countless imitators, Cars is nonetheless another heartfelt, beautiful triumph worthy of the Pixar label. As with all things animated, Cars works best when the action speaks for itself, when the animation suspends character interaction in favor of broad and breathtaking observational sweeps, via the American highway, poignantly harking back to days of old in completely new family-friendly gestures. While the humbling of hot-rod hot-shot Lightning Mcqueen (Wilson in one of his most convincing roles) and subsequent homage to mid west America may not have been pieced together in the most convincing of manners, Cars will still sweep excited children into it's blazing introduction, mellow out with it's sweet and funny character interaction and race past the finish line in a blaze of feel good family entertainment from the highest, visually animated order.",1

The film is gorgeously drawn and animated, wonderfully voiced by Owen Wilson as the race car, Paul Newman as an old-timer with a secret, and several others, and the antics of the characters are hysterical. CARS provides one laugh after another, with a series of nonstop gags and one-liners leading up to a thrilling finish. Make sure you hang around for and after the credits for some terrific throwaway gags and ""outtakes,"" the funniest one involving John Ratzenberger's character reacting to a rather peculiar situation at the local drive-in.

It turned out that ""Cars""is the least enjoyable of all Pixar's productions. The animation is as always breathtaking. The film is obviously visually stunning and a great number of scenes is beautiful. The idea of humanized talking cars was awe-inspiring and provided a room to display screenwriters' talent. However, they missed a chance to make other instant classic. The plot is rather typical and painfully predictable with an obvious message known from the very beginning. What's more, the script is not abound with wonderful ideas (I found only allusion to Road 66 interesting) and humorous situations, which was a trademark of previous Pixar's films. The emphasis is rightly placed on likable characters humanized by the excellent voice cast. Although not so great as ""Monsters, Inc"" or ""The Incredibles"", this flick is still worth seeing.",1

I just like how lighting McQueen starts off as a cocky race car, but then when he meets the folks of Raider Springs, He learns that their is more in life than just racing. Doc Hudson is also a great character, I like how he starts as an old grouchy regular car, But then lighting McQueen discovery's that he'd used to be an old famous racing legend. The ending race was amazing and great, and it was great when lighting McQueen helped The King push him to the finish line. I don't understand why people say this is an ok movie!

122,,"Disney had to generate a new line of plastic things. From toilet paper to bed sheets. Probably the Princess thing was too far behind and Hello Kitty was in the future. So you bring three (!) people to cook up a story with every cliché in the book. Well, who cares about the story anyway. So race cars don't have lights. But they get arrested for messing up the asphalt and no word about speeding at night with the lights off in the wrong lane. Talk about a good children story. And if we have to be true to the race car story, why not make it a tractor and a bulldozer in the same story? And for a script that bad you need some seven guys to make it work.",0
123,8.0,"Cars brings the good heart of caring for one another and also that fame doesn't always mean everything will always be super, both with a theme of vehicles as people. The country theme as most of the whole was a nice pick for a film that had race car driving. Wilson makes a good voice act for the selfish-but-then-caring lead character, and Larry the cable guy portrays one hilarious hillbilly-like country folk. For the whole vehicle theme alone, there was some pretty clever parts for each of the cars themselves, including eyes on the windshield and the front wheels for the arms/hands. It was also interesting to see some references, including Dinaco being referred from Toy Story. Overall, like mentioned before, a very nice and inspiring story and a clever vehicle theme, while it may look a bit childish at first, that happens to be one of my favorites. Cudos to Pixar for their seventh full-length film.",1

I especially enjoyed Larry the Cable Guy as Mater! I found this movie rather exciting and fun to watch! There were not any parts of the movie where I wished that it was moving faster or that they would get to the point quicker, the whole movie was perfect! When I saw the previews for the movie I thought that the movie was completely about racing, but it wasn't! I found that this movie had some racing material in it but was much more than that!

'Cars' from their only film that I had yet to see, and so I greeted it with a lot of anticipation. Having finished it, I find myself considering a step-down from Pixar's other classics, such as 'Toy Story' or 'Monsters Inc.,' but that doesn't stop it from being an above-average two hours. In a world dominated by automobiles, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is a super-successful rookie in competitive racing; all that remains for him is to win the prestigious Piston Cup, if only he can surpass retiring champion The King (Richard Petty) and cocky Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).

Has anyone noticed that, besides the fact that the story doesn't surprise the viewer even once, it's pretty much the same as in ""surf's up""? A young talented guy enters a challenge, meets his old hero (who has stopped doing what he was once the best at, for a tragic reason), doesn't recognize him at first, then gets him to give some advice, and finally is the winner of the hearts, although not actually winning the challenge.

132,3.0,"The premise of Cars is one we've seen a million times before. Hot shot thinks he's the best. Hot shot runs into needy group of screw-ups. Hot shot comes to epiphany and gives up his superficial dream to help his lovable friends. Not that there is a problem with this premise in and of itself. These days it isn't so much what the movie is about as much as how we get there. We've all seen horror movies but Jaws made it an adventure. We've all seen war stories but Saving Private Ryan made it an experience. It is all in the ride, the ups and downs, the twists and turns (do NOT take this to mean all movies need twists (they don't (M. Night Shyamalan is a hack))). Therein lies Cars biggest flaw, the ride. All Pixar movies are gimmicky concepts to begin with but they set themselves apart in the ride. Well, all Pixar movies except Cars. I can't say for certain because I haven't been to Pixar's HQ but I imagine there is a plaque mounted on the front door that reads ""MISSION STATEMENT: Leave no object un-anthropomorphized. It's cute and the jokes are easy."" Incidentally, their only movie to focus on humans was their best, The Incredibles. But Cars follows the old formula. Instead of windshields the cars have eyes. Instead of grills a mouth. Instead of.well that's about as far as it goes. There is a half-hearted attempt to make the tires into appendages but it falls short and makes you feel like you are watching someone or something with a disability. Simply put, it does not work. The Cars inhabit a world devoid of all animal life (but plants are in full bloom?). While a noble effort it just raises plenty of questions: why do they need buildings? Who made the buildings? Who makes the cars? How do cars ""die?"" How come all of the cities are fictional and have cute car-related names except for Los Angeles? How do their politicians feel about issues concerning green house gases and exhaust fumes? Instead of using this opportunity to make some funny and insightful jokes the film seems to shrug carelessly and say ""well it's just like our world only instead of people they're cars!"" Sorry but it is boring to watch cars driving for two hours (NASCAR). Why did anyone think this was a good idea? How long would people sit along side the highway before deciding that they have had enough of watching cars drive by? My guess would be a hell of a lot less than two hours. This movie seems designed for a niche audience. And who knows, maybe I would have liked it a lot more if I were a gearhead. But I feel like I got most of the jokes. Like the car named Luigi (Tony Shaloub), complete with Italian accent and bravado, likes Ferraris, and the Mack truck is named Mack (John Ratzenberger). But suggesting that these jokes would be funny even to gearheads is more insulting than calling them, well, gearheads. Lame. Lame. Lame. Cars go to a diner to eat food. That's crazy. The cars go to a diner to get gas! You know, because gas is like food for cars. Or the flies are really VW Bugs. Get it? Flies. Bugs. Yes, I get it. And it doesn't end there. Cameos galore! Jay Limo is the late night host while Bob Cutlass and Darrell Cartrip are the sports commentators. Not to mention all of the hilarity that ensues in car crashes. I don't know if that's just me but I was sort of put off by the movie's carefree use of multiple car pile-ups. The problems of this film are too many to count and frankly, it is boring me trying to remember them all. Bottom line is that anything that made the old Pixar pics enjoyable is completely lacking here. All jokes are as predictable as the sunrise. The characters are as exciting as 2nd grade sketches. And most importantly there is no worthwhile reflection of our society whatsoever. As a punishment the hero of the film, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), has to pave a road. Sounds like punishment to me, so don't make me watch it for a majority of the movie.",0

It could've been, for example, a clunker of a formulaic animated movie where not only do you know what will happen every step of the way after a while the imbalance of comedy and the rest of the more grounded parts of the story detract from any pleasure from seeing the movie work on its own. Pixar, and particularly its co-founder John Lasseter, are particularly based on the importance of the story- however much it might lend itself to others- and having the best cast to go alongside the most believable visual schemes. Cars worked for me as being something that is akin to those ""old-fashioned"" picture of its kind (which I mean here as a compliment and not as some kind of put-down like others might), where after a little bit in the story you'll know what will happen, but it's fun seeing what's done within the scenes and how unexpected bits of delight come from the characters.",1

Everybody in cars is some model of automobile or an accessory that furnishes help for an automobile. The cars have expressive eyes in their windshields and mouths in their front end grilles. They display a limited ability to gesture with their tires as if the tires were arms. As many as a dozen scribes, among them Joe Ranft, Dan Fogelman, Kiel Murray, Jorgen Klubien, and Phil Lorin, including Lasseter, have concocted a thoroughly entertaining romp in the NASCAR like circuit about antics of an independent but immature rookie race car named Lightning MacQueen.

Lightning McQueen, has demonstrated almost every human passion and emotion during the short duration of 1:35 hrs. ""Turn right to turn left"" was not just a technique proposed by the doc but also a straight hint to the audience. When things don't seem to work as they should, the exactly opposite method to do it can work wonders. I think this very statement was the catch-phrase in the movie. The animation and computer graphics are taken care of with immense detail. At times it felt as if the close-up shots of the revolving wheels were actually close-up shots of a real car wheel.

Occasionally a gem like Coco (2017) seeps through their cracks. This movie was released at the height of Pixar's powers, and, befittingly, opens with this really confident country pop song by Sheryl Crow, ""Real Gone"", as the epic sound design of the race cars zooming across a circuit captures our collective attention. Lightning McQueen is first introduced as this cocky celebrity, too. It's immediately obvious that his arc will be one of change and personal growth. And indeed, McQueen comes to appreciate the quiet life in the rural Radiator Springs, in the company of a colourful supporting cast, including Paul Newman as Doc Hudson. He learns the secrets and fundamental intricacies of racing, falls in love and makes a best friend in the fan-favourite Mater. There's also an honest message thrown in about civic progress - and how it left the noble Radiator Springs to rot. Like, this is a quintessential, baseline story you can find in every form of modern narrative. Kids love it for the cars, naturally, and the action, absolutely, but there are lessons to be learned from Cars. The ending is bold, and in true Pixar fashion: very moving. Lightning McQueen refuses to win the race, in order to push the former champion Strip ""The King"" Weathers across the Finish Line following a major crash. This echoes Doc Hudson's crash. ""They gave up on me"". Lightning can rewrite history, and chooses to do so with grit and honour. Chick Hicks is an awesome villain, and I'm probably biased cos I know he was voice-acted by Michael Keaton... I love the fact Lightning's Agent is voiced by Jeremy Piven, because, of course he is. I love the delinquent Tuner Cars who set the story into action by having McQueen slide out of Mack the Big Rig, the humble Rust-Eze Brand which Lightning reluctantly sponsors, until coming to realise their integrity by the end of the film, and the diehard fans who ""flash"" Lightning with their blinkers; a cheeky gag thrown in by Pixar. Little details like this are absent from Pixar's current film output, but they DO make up the big picture. There was a clear attempt to make Cars timeless and beyond any standard age demographics... Unlike, who knows, Turning Red (2022) for instance, a movie about rambunctious teenagers catering towards rambunctious teenagers... Pixar have lost the art of timelessness. Cars is an excellent film - One I respected as a tyke back in the 2000's. Not only that, but it's held up thus far. It's got a beating heart, thanks in part to Paul Newman's voice performance, Randy Newman's musical score and John Lasseter's direction. Moreover, Lightning McQueen is probably, visually at least, the most iconic Pixar character after Woody. He's become legendary in that pop-cultural sense, and Cars 3 (2017) does well to reaffirm that... Mostly.",1

McQueen gave it his all, burning up the race track, peeling rubber, kicking up dust, and finally edged his way to the finish line with two back tires blown out. Unfortunately, King and Hicks traveled at the same speed and the outcome was a three-way tie. A tie-breaker race would be held the following week in California.

Afterwards, he was loaded into his trailer and pulled away by Mack the truck. As night approached, Mack wanted to stop at a truck stop for some shuteye, but McQueen was determined to get to California as soon as possible, so he made Mack drive all night. Unfortunately, fatigue soon overtook the big truck, as well as some cheeky, tricked-out hot rods, causing McQueen to roll out of his trailer onto deserted Highway 40. McQueen quickly came to and took off, looking for Mack, but found nothing other than an empty road and some rude big rigs. Soon enough, McQueen raced into a small town off Route 66. This was Radiator Springs, a rural, backwoods simple town run by classic cars. ",1

I am not an emotional man, nor do I ever display them, even in front of my wife, but the unspeakable things I felt during this cinematic experience can't be put into words. Truly the only words that can sum up a feeling better than my son's birth or even my 5th divorce would be, as Three-time Piston Cup Champion Chick Hicks would say... KACHIGAAAAAAA.",1
177,5.0,I had great expectations but I was disappointed and so was my wife because the story is not very original and special. Therefore I have great respect for the special effects and the beautiful cinematography. After Ice Age 1 and 2 CARS shows very clear the power of high perfection in technical possibilities creating such animation movies. Okay there were some good and lovely sequences but there wasn't so much to laugh as in the Ice Ages. For all these reasons I gave 5/10 and even my 4year old son forgot quick this one and loves much more Finding Nemo or Ice Age. I think the votes here are too overrated. For all fans of this genre and for all kids I recommend THE POLAR EXPRESS that is no doubt a great movie for Christmas time.,1
178,10.0,I thought it was a fantastic movie! Hilarious! It has a good lesson with it too. If your thinking on going to see it is a absolute must see!!You will love the characters.You will just love it from beginning to end! I'm not going to give anything away about the movie cause I don't want to ruin your excitement. Their is a lot of goofs though and it is just the best animation movie I have ever seen! And I have seen a lot of them in all my life! It is hard to say nothing to give away about the movie! Oh yeah I almost forgot! If you are a Larry The Cable Guy fan you have to see it. I will have to shut up soon this is the longest review I have ever written I am tired got to go to bed soon this is my last line I'm glad.,1

180,10.0,"If anybody had told me I would have tears in my eyes over a film about cartoon talking cars then I'd have called them mad - but of course, if anyone can, Pixar can - and they have. I can't fault it. As you'd expect, the animation is sensational. Not only is it technically good, it's stunningly beautiful too. The characters are great - there's a moral curve but it's not rammed down your throat and the movie never slips into saccharine. The music is great and well picked. The race scenes are genuinely exciting - better than watching the real thing. And there's even a hippy acid casualty VW camper van - who tickled me pink...",1

189,6.0,"This was the seventh Pixar/Disney release in the cinemas, and it was also the celebration of twenty years of the two studios collaboration, and after seeing plenty of clips I was looking forward to it. Basically in a world where all characters are motor vehicles, in California, hotshot rookie Le Mans endurance racer car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is competing against two main competitors, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) and Strip 'The King' Weathers (Richard Petty), to win the Piston Cup. When the three racing cars tie across the finish line, they all start travelling to Los Angeles to the tie-breaker race, and with sleepy lorry Mack (John Ratzenberger) transporting Lightning, the racing car in unintentionally dropped off, ending up in the detoured Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. In his stride, he manages to damage the road, and he is sentenced by Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, in his final film role) to repair the road, which will take about five days, not very good if he wants to get to the race track. Lightning initially rushes the community service job to get out of the town as quickly as possible, but this just ends up keeping him there longer, starting all over again. As he stays however he makes some good friends who teach him some valuable lessons about life, including rusty pickup truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and the cute eventual love interest, Porsche 911 Carrera Sally (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt). After discovering the reason for the town being so quite, being cut off from the interstate and taken off the map, and also that Doc used to be a successful racing car himself, winning two Piston Cups, Lightning wants to help more than just fixing the road. After lighting the town up with some great neon lights, he is then finally found by the press and Mack who want to take him back to the racing track in Los Angeles ready for the big race. Lightning does initially keep thinking about Radiator Springs, but then he sees all his new friends, including the originally uninterested Doc, are watching him in the audience, and the race gets underway. Lightning remembers one or tricks he learnt in the town, and it comes to the final lap, where Chick rams The King so hard that he is very badly damaged in his crash, and Lightning sacrifices his winning place to help him across the finish line. In the end, winner Chick is booed and it is Lightnign offered the sponsorship from Dinoco (the motoring company from Toy Story), but he turns it down to stay with his Rust-Eze sponsors, and he makes sure Route 66 is back on the map, and obviously to get the affection of Sally. Also starring Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Ramone, George Carlin as Fillmore, Tony Shalhoub as Luigi, Ratzenberger as Hamm Truck / Abominable Snow Plow / P.T. Flea Car (all in credits in-jokes), Jeremy Clarkson as Harv (U.K. version), Jeremy Piven as Harv (U.S. version), Michael Schumacher, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks as Woody Car, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear Car, Billy Crystal as Mike Car, John Goodman as Sullivan Truck, Dave Foley as Flik Car, Sheryl Crow as Elvis and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Sven 'The Governator'. I can sort of agree with the critics, this could have been a little better, but with a great cast list, some good in-jokes and heart, some good nostalgia of past Pixar successes (including ""Lightyear"" tyres and For the Birds cameos), it is not a bad animated comedy fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""Our Town"" and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Film. Good!",1
190,8.0,"I rewatched Cars a few days ago and I honestly thought it was great. Sure, the concept of talking cars performing tasks that humans usually do is a bit weird but it didn't distract from the message that the film portrays. Lightning McQueen starts off the movie as an overconfident celebrity who thinks he's better than everyone else and eventually learns how to slow down and enjoy life. I do think this movie gets a little too much hate but if you didn't enjoy it, then its fine.",1

194,10.0,"Pixar has outdone themselves with this one. I was a little skeptical on how they could pull off another masterpiece with Cars as a theme, and was pleasantly surprised to see that they not only pulled it off, they far exceeded my expectations. They managed to combine the nostalgia of Toy Story with a great story such as Finding Nemo, and made it appeal to all ages from my 4 year old son up through the older generations, who will be pleased with the inclusion of many references to an era gone by. It was also by far the funniest Pixar release to date.",1
195,10.0,"Even though I am a ''car guy'', when I first saw the previews I was like, ''Talking cars? Allllrighty then.'' I was very very very wrong. You forget early in the movie that cars can't talk, and the opening scene really grips you. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are great in this movie, and pretty much all the other voices are perfect too. AWESOME animation, Pixar's best in my opinion. The jokes are very funny, and there is quite a bit of hidden adult humor that will just go right over the kids heads. Soundtrack is great (along with everything else about this movie), containing a good variety of music. This movie is not just for kids and car lovers, but everybody will enjoy it!",1
196,5.0,A lot of people consider this to be one of the underdogs of pixar and indeed I agree that it was the first movie by them to not be sheer awesome.,1
197,10.0,"Great story full of action and heart. There is humor for everyone and a lesson gently tucked in. You do not have to be a car fanatic or a NASCAR fan to enjoy this movie. Amazing animation, you have to remind yourself it is not real. It is truly beautiful, the colors and details are phenomenal! The choices for the actors/voices/personalities was perfect. You fall in love with each character and their quirks and also identify with several of them. We highly recommend this movie for all ages, we had early teens, late teens , twenties and 40's in our group and we all loved it! Can't wait to see it again as well as own it on video. These characters and the story line are so good that we can imagine another movie being made to follow up! Hope that is in the works!",1

200,2.0,"This movie is awful. The animation is good but i don't get the whole point of this??? It's about a car who's trying to win the race. Come on??? Is this really Pixar? I'm okay if this was Dreamworks because in my opinion Dreamworks sucks except for Shrek 1 and 2 and how to train your dragon. The story was bad, the plot looked like it was unfinished. Horrible movie. Just plain Horrible!!! >:{ come on Pixar you can do better then this. I don't recommend this movie to anyone except if your a very very huge Pixar fan. This movie is overrated it 7.5 stars? This movie should be about like 6 stars. Anyways, I'll give this movie a 2/10 because of the graphics.",0

202,10.0,"I never expected a animation picture to have such a good message to it. The animation has gone to the next level that nothing really looks artificial. Everything you see is real except for the fact that the players are cars. At one point, you start feeling even the cars speak! Lightning Mcqueen's ultimate goal in life is to win the Piston Cup. The story revolves around his encounters before he reaches the grand finale. A very well written script, lively animation especially the Interstate roads,the car characters, the cute Porsche, good dialogs make this movie worth watching for all adults. It is always better to slow down a bit to succeed in fast-paced life. This is one of the many messages you get in this entertaining movie with several twists and turns. Great movie!",1
203,6.0,"A good, solid production from Pixar, as usual. Great design, computer animation, special f/x, soundtrack, etc. But, having said that, I have to say I expected much more from this film and was slightly disappointed in the end. This mostly due to an overly simplistic script and a story that fails to engage the viewer and 'capture' him at any point.",0

It's not only about a journey of a rising race car, but it's also about friendship, loyalty, consistency, kindness and noble hearted. It makes me laugh, but also makes me cry. It brings me to anger, but to the extent of not too angry. It's just the perfect mix and match. Good job! Good job! A really good job! If you love your family, watch this movie. If you love your friend, ask them to watch this movie together. If you are kind hearted, watch this movie over and over again. I will never be bored watching this again and again and again and again ... and so on.",1
206,9.0,This Movie is Fantastic weather it's the racing the humour or the story. Randy Newman does a good job on the score. My only critic is that the second act is a bit slow but that didn't bother me that much. The Casting is Incredible.,1

The story in this movie is immaculate, the cocky kid goes to a humble man the way that the writers made this movie just shows how much passion they put into the film. I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life. The animation is one of the greats for it's time the way they made it seem so human like. This is a great movie from beginning to end. I'm so glad I was able to see this movie.",1
209,10.0,"Throughout ""Cars"", the scenery (including deserts, mountains, trees, and waterfalls) looks so realistic you'd swear the cars were digitally inserted into film footage! The overhead shot of the Los Angeles raceway and the scenes of thousands of cars in the bleachers are the most elaborate scenes that Pixar has ever done. The ""starring"" cars themselves are as anthropomorphic as Pixar could make them, a vast improvement over Disney's old cartoon,""Suzie, The Little Blue Coupe."" Each car has a distinct personality. The best are Tow Mater, the tow truck, and Fillmore, the 1960s Volkswagen bus who, if he were human, would be referred to as an ""old hippie."" Lots of clever car-related gags too. And the closing credits, where the cars are watching movies at the drive-in, are the best part of the film!",0
210,7.0,"this is a very enjoyable movie from start to the finish line(pun intended)Pixar have done it again...This time with cars ,the imagination and ideas behind this movie are incredibly funny...Without the use of humans in this movie it makes all that bit more exciting and enjoyable ..to see a Volkswagen camper van as a hippy and a hummer as Arnold Schwarzenegger is just pure genius.",1

Lackluster Pixar animated fare about the world of cars with Wilson as a cocky racing car holed up in a dust-choked burg off of Rte. 66 forced to do community service after breaking the law upheld by a crusty judge (Newman having fun) and learning some life lessons along the way. Unless you're a car enthusiast (which I am so not; half the problem) then you won't mind the chatty and quite frankly unabsorbing fable (the other half of the problem) in spite of the eye-candy of the CGI cranked out expertly by filmmaker John Lesseter a reported labor of love for the self-professed auto buff; me - not so much but I did get a kick out of Shalhoub and particularly scene-stealer Quaroni as Italian accented garage owning vehicles and a bully-jerk Keaton as Wilson's chief competition.",1

It tells a beautiful story of taking life slowly, enjoying it, and being a good person. The songs are touching and there is some good comedy. The races are also very entertaining and McQueens character change is well executed. It does have it's flaws, like some of the racing rules and some things like Tractor Tipping are fun but weird. Overall, this is a great film and is one of Pixar's finest works, it deserves better recognition and praise.",1

But we see later that McQueen is really cold and harsh compared to the humble residents of Radiator Springs, the small town where he crash lands. But will Lightning ever find his way back? Will he be doomed to lose to the cheating Chick Hicks? Watch it! From the creators of Toy Story, A Bug's Life, The Incredibles, Toy Story 2,and Finding Nemo comes what should be set to win the 2007 best picture Oscar.

217,,"Widely held as Pixar's weakest, Cars (John Lasseter and John Ranft, 2006) is unexceptional but easy-to-take, with a well-worn plot given bright treatment. As has been said before, it's Doc-Hollywood-but-with-cars, as a speedy, superficial young buck - race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) - gets stranded in a small hick town where the residents' goodheartedness and easy-going nature start to work their magic. As in the Michael J. Fox-starrer, our conceited hero is asked to repair the damage he caused during his noisy arrival, and ends up dating a female lawyer who wound up in the area after an unhappy stint in the big city. (Having said that, Doc Hollywood itself is a hybrid of Local Hero, The Secret of My Success, a Dr Kildare, and a complete mess, so it's hardly the essence of originality.) Cars is well-short of the studio's best: Up, WALL-E, Ratatouille and Monsters, Inc., but the usual spark is periodically apparent, particularly in the treatment of tractors and a hysterical epilogue in which Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are given a new spin (pun intended). Elsewhere, colourful characters and cut-to-the-chase races compensate for the sometimes slack narrative and muddled motor-y message. Nice James Taylor song, too.",1
218,10.0,"The best movie of the year!!! I see Gloden Globe and Oscar in the near future for Cars. I don't like Owen Wilson much as an actor, but he has done an amazing job as ""Lightning McQueen"" as the up and coming hot rod rookie on the Piston Cup circuit. Paul Newman, what more could be said about this wonderful man? With the pairing of Larry the Cable Guy and Owen Wilson these two hit the ball right out of the park with perfectly delivered lines to make the most hypocritical person laugh. John Lasseter has made another hit with a very old story and some of the best actors anyone could ask for.",1

220,10.0,"Masterfully created, and as others have already stated, it truly captures both the spirit of Route 66 and the beauty of the country long bypassed by the Interstate. Lessons for the kids are ever-present, subtle, yet firmly implanted within each character that they watch on the screen.",1

As frequent Route 66 travelers, we were awarded with not only an excellent story but also an homage to the Mother Road. We had a blast trying to spot and then identify all the places we have seen along 66. Hopefully, it will inspire others to get off the interstate and revisit all the ""Radiator Springs"" that are still alive on Route 66. We especially loved where the Cadillacs from Cadillac Ranch appeared (you have to watch the mountain scenery) and how the WigWam Hotel became the Cozy Cones. We just finished another run down 66 a week ago, but after seeing Cars, we are ready to go ""get our kicks"" again.",1
222,5.0,"It was inevitable. The string of winners churned out by Pixar and Disney had to end sometime. And it ends with Cars. That's not to say there aren't moments in the film to enjoy. The beginning and ending of the film are great. As long as the action is centered on the racetrack, Cars is good and entertaining. Unfortunately, there's that whole middle hour or so where things get incredibly dull. After the slam-bang start, the next hour is talk, talk, and more talk. I took my three year-old to see the movie and both he and I were squirming about half way through. I had to bribe him to get him to stay through the finish. The problem with much of the film is that it's so predictable. There are no surprises anywhere in the bland and tired script.",0
223,3.0,"Cars, the second Pixar dud I had to sit through (though with lower expectations than A Bug's Life), was unfortunately one of the final films for some absolutely amazing actors, like George Carlin and Paul Newman. The only plus that I can give it is that since it's Pixar, they try with the animation and it paid off: the visuals are cool to stare at if seeming more generic than other Pixar movies. For the rest of the film, however, I was absolutely stultified by how the humor was rather low-quality for a Pixar movie (tractor cattle that can blow flatulence-sounding exhaust, somehow), and how the story couldn't engage me even with one musical scene that I felt recycled excessively from When She Loved Me. Some characters are nice, like Lightning McQueen, who did a Samaritan action near the end that I greatly appreciated and boosted points for, but others mainly make borderline abysmal jokes or act stereotypical or anything other than likable. It just goes to show you that even when John Lasseter is one of the biggest people at the company, that doesn't mean he can make only decent movies. All this movie felt overall was one more reason to sell more Cars-painted Hot Wheels and similar toy cars in order to blast the competition away. It paid off in the toy market, but as a movie it's one that I would pass. The good news is, Pixar recovered from here, this time with something more original than 7 years prior.",0

You even see the reflections and dust raised from the ground. Second, the landscape. Just unbelievable. (2) Very good script. Though predictable at times, but it is nicely paced. (3) Excellent voices. Each of the voices exactly match the characteristic of the car. (4) Good music. Movie starts with catchy music from Sheryl Crow and has very good numbers. (5) Excellent short movie. You have to see to believe these.",1
225,10.0,"Everything about this movie was great, great characters, great voices from an all-star cast, fantastic imagery. The story was very good, the animation was spectacular, the overall movie was positively brilliant. The world being nothing but cars was great, right down to the campers in the infield.

I've always loved the story of this amazing Pixar movie, Lightning Macqueen although at first he's very vain during his trip to Radietor Springs will become much more friendly and generous. The characters are really good because they are simple and I really love the machines and I don't mind seeing them talking.

They have since consistently made smash hit after smash hit. Even if I don't think that Monsters Inc. or The Incredibles even compare to Toy Story, there is no denying that Pixar always manages to keep its own brand of magic in every picture they release. Despite all of that, the concept of Cars did scare me a little. It seemed a little too loose and almost unimaginative by comparison. However, with a chance to see it for free, I couldn't say no, and thankfully not, as even if it isn't quite in the same league as Finding Nemo or Toy Story, Cars is a pleasant timewaster for the whole family.",1

The old tow truck, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, is my favorite character, and he functions as the voice of the drawling hick. The sports car is reckless and unpredictable. Of course, vehicles of law enforcement have their own way of acting as well. So the creators have put together an entire subculture where these vehicles are the stars. It sounds silly until we begin to be engaged in their roles. There are protagonists, antagonists, characters of comic relief, just like any movie, animated or not. Pixar has masterfully connected what would have been flat animated images and brought them to life. I'm not much of a car fancier, but this one still got me. There's adventure, romance, and a race. What else could we want?",1
231,10.0,"This is more properly ""Trivia"" but I didn't see any way to submit a trivia item, so here goes: While almost all the landscapes in the movie look extremely realistic, there are a couple of scenes depicting these giant, very peculiar looking sandstone rock formations. They look peculiar because they're modeled on the rear ends of the Cadillacs that are half-buried, nose-first, into the ground at the ""Cadillac Ranch"" in Texas. As to my ""review,"" well, the wife had to drag me to this movie kicking and screaming as I've become very tired of computer animated cartoons. I'm glad as heck she DID however because it was EXCELLENT! I was impressed by the story, which contained real lessons about what and WHO should be important in ones life. On a technical note, the visual and SOUND depiction of the racing sequences was nothing short of INCREDIBLE! I completely forgot that nothing I was watching was real. Disney/Pixar have another winner.",1
232,6.0,"To mix my metaphors, Pixar has been something like the engine on a '57 Chevy: Big, good, and reliable. As many in Hollywood will tell you, the cost of entry in the game is the story, not the money any more. ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" is a good example (though ultimately a wretched green-screen joke, unfortunately) that anyone can muscle their way in with a Mac and a dream. Given this, Pixar's storytelling prowess has consistently rated second to none: Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and, in my opinion, their best, The Incredibles, Pixar seemingly couldn't miss a mark in the 20+ years now of leading the vanguard of computer animation.

258,7.0,"""Cars"" is a Pixar production that I think is mediocre. What drives this movie thought is the animation, the speed and attention to details. The animation is detailed with the vehicle movements and environment,it's cool and entertaining. In another words the CGI is just topnotch when this movie came out. When it comes to the plot, it's in a universe where cars are alive like humans except they are cars. And revolves around a hotshot NASCAR that lives in the fast-lane and has a cocky and a bit of a narcissistic attitude. Until he has no choice to be among different people and that changes his perception and mentality, while also changing him to become a better race-car. So yeah, this is a story that has been done before, I can actually think of couple of movies from the top of my head that has the similar or even same premise. Except this time it revolves around characters that are cars. I wasn't excepting much from this movie, nor did it exceed my expectation. But it's a very watchable movie, that is a fun ride...At least the first time around. I also thought the character development is good in this, not great but they did a pretty darn good job developing multiple characters. And by the end, I actually sort of cared for the characters. And making talking vehicles likable and have certain amount of emotions for is actually a commendable task in my opinion. I remember when I first saw a Chevron promotional animation as a kid and thought it would be cool if they made a movie out of it. And I would have eaten this movie up as a kid and for that I also give it credit, since this is suppose to be a family film. Overall, this isn't a groundbreaking Pixar movie or all that memorable. But the animation with a bit of substance actually makes this one a good watch.",1
259,7.0,"So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles? ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings. It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen. The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices. It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).",1
260,6.0,"Pixar finally made a not-so-good movie. OK, it was good.. sometimes it was actually pretty good.. but most of the time it was just OK... and there were moments where it was, mmmh, how to put it, mmmh, well, almost bad. If there is 1 sin that I cannot forgive in movies, is Boredom. For me, a movie can have bad acting, bad effects, bad music, bad direction... but if it has a bad screenplay, it better NOT be because it's BORING. And Cars, unfortunately, it has a small dose of that. The movie runs for about 2 hours, and there were many times when I caught myself thinking things that had nothing to do with the movie (did I left my PC turned on when I left home?)... the story was simply NOT engrossing enough. You may say that maybe I wasn't in the mood for an animated film, but you would be wrong. I was in the mood. Besides, the best judges in the theatre could corroborate my words: All around me, kids were starting to lose any interest in the movie by the second half of it. Even my kids where apparently more excited to play with their Cars action figures than watching the ""real thing"" on the screen. But enough with the bad... wait, I'm not done. The movie seems to be directed to... I don't know who, but not to the people who liked the other Pixar films. I mean, now I know what my girlfriend felt when I made here watch with me films like ""Any Given Sunday"". I felt lost as to why those Cars were making such a big deal of a race. Things like having a ""cameo"" of this driver guy Schumacher (totally sic) flew over me until after like 10 seconds when my brain woke up and look for his name in the file cabinet for ""unnecessary general culture/pseudo-sports"" (btw, he's this big-shot driver, kinda like the Michael Jordan of racing, I guess). Then, if you'd know me, you would know that I'm a guy with a very, VERY good sense of suspension of disbelief. Throw me all the wizards, unicorns, aliens, ghosts, superheroes, valiant reporters, gooey masses, talking animals, living toys, God, the Devil, whatever! I will hold my brain ""on hold"" and believe it all for the duration of the movie, so I can enjoy it, you know. But here, I just couldn't do it. I've heard the expression ""leave your brain at the entrance"" many times, but this is the first time that I've actually wish I could do it. How in the HELL can we believe in a world where EVERYTHING is cars-related! As hard as I tried, I couldn't stop from thinking that the damn machines do NOT have hands! There's no way they can ""create"" anything, let alone something as sophisticated as, well, human-like lifestyles! I now realized that in every movie there's always something/someone with hands. This idea, a world populated with cars, may work in shows like Thomas The Tank, or maybe Bob The Builder (but there Bob has hands), BUT these shows are segments of 20 minutes tops, and they are idea-based on some moral argument directed at 2, 3 or 4 years old kids! They're like a naptime story that you usually don't have to explain because the point of the story is the idea of ""sharing"", or ""be nice to your siblings"", or some other brainwashing message to have better kids. Here, in a movie that's supposed to be fun for little kids, as well as for adults, or just kids that are potty-trained, well, it just didn't worked. The good things are what make Pixar probably the best animation company out there. The graphics were excellent as expected. The highlight would be the short animation ""One Man Band"". Totally hilarious with a lot of emotions mixed in its scarce 5 or so minutes. Probably my second favourite next to ""Yak-Yak Attack"". I would say that the short film made it worth going to watch Cars, but I still wondered why didn't I left my wife with the kids and went to watch ""Nacho Libre"" instead. OK, I gotta stop myself. I started writing this saying that the movie is OK, but the more I write about it, the more I'm actually hating it. That wasn't supposed to happen. I know that you will see for yourself if this movie sucks or not, I just hope that you have a better control of your brain that I do, and that your day is REALLY relaxed, so you can stand the boredom of s stroll thru Route 66.",0

I'm not sure that it needed to be that long and the middle of the film dragged significantly. I think that really was one of the major things that dragged Cars down. On top of that despite a really cute and interesting supporting cast the main character of Lightning McQueen wasn't as strong as he needed to be.

Respect has to be earned over time, and it's not granted to a person automatically, which I think is a really great lesson for kids and adults alike. It shows that life is more than just a journey.

The inconsistency of presentation is a major distraction. Car does possess good substance, a decent storyline, with some cute one-liners for car racing fans.

I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters around the time it came out, and how popular new Pixar characters seemed at the time. But, this movie did not appeal to me when it came out. I'd see this movie a final time a few years later even as an adult.

Unfortunately, on his way there, his truck (voiced by John Ratzenberger:have you ever noticed that he has done voices for every Pixar movie?) falls asleep, and accidentally spills out Lightning McQueen (the car).

And the cast chosen to voice the characters was very well chosen. Owen Wilson is perfect for the voice of lighting McQueen. And Bonnie Hunt was a great fit too. The chemistry between the characters was very sweet and intimate, made you value the characters and the the relationships they held with others. And just let me say that who else could play ToMator soooo perfectly other than Larry the Cable Guy?? I'm not a fan of Larry personally, but he was the PERFECT choice to voice his Redneck down to earth hilarious character. This movie really has all you could ever ask for from a film of this kind. Well written/times humor in the right places, sentimental value, a tad bit of romance, quality dialogue, and great fitting actors to voice the animated characters. I totally suggest giving this animated gem a watch. It'll give you that warm fuzzy feeling with a side of laughs. 9/10 for Cars.",1

Simply put, Disney is tired and only rehashes stereotypical characters to bank on old successes. Pixar has delighted us with new characters every time (including in the sequel to Toy Story, BTW there is a Toy Story 3 on the way) by mostly abandoning everything it already knew and starting with a totally new story and totally new characters. There was no letdown in this film. Wise of someone at Disney to keep Pixar in the fold. I dearly hope that same wise influence keeps Disney's script writers out of Pixar.",0

With the exception of Toy Story 2 and Cars since the 1998 A Bug's Life until the 2009 Up I saw all of them on the big screen (not sure if I saw Toy Story on the big screen but is a fact that I saw it, just like Toy Story 2, many times on VHS) but anyway, I saw Cars for the very first time complete last Thursday on Blu-ray (visually was, obviously, a delight), before I had seen some parts on TV, like the part when the protagonist, race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), is sleeping while his driver, the truck Mack (the detail of the gimme cap is just fantastic), takes him to California for the race that McQueen will have to win to be for the very first time the champion of the Piston Cup. I had seen that part at least a couple of times on TV, is a big plot point that will lead Lighting McQueen simply to a new life. There's a certain thing with the hero of this movie",1
306,8.0,"Walking into CARS was like opening the door into the past and reliving those Dominican festivals of corn: a contest consisting of virtually hundreds of corn-made confections and dishes, some sweet, some salty, some spicy, some thick with butter and cheese and chocolate, others with little more than the grain itself. CARS is one of these confections: a movie that is so drenched in displaced sentimentalism given to machines that it gives even the most shameless incursion into schmaltz seem like an experiment in Kubrickesque storytelling. It is tailor made for corn, for emotions, for the family, for pummeling its message with the subtlety of an A-Bomb. Anyone feeling surprised at the plot developments ought to be shot on sight and thrown into the nearest gutter. This one of the sweetest, corniest movies I've come across, so corny that when I took in its visuals I reeled back and caught myself nearly passing out. I then thought about the one fat mouse telling Ratatouille in the promo for next Spring's movie of the same name ""If you can get past the gag reflex, it's not that bad,"" as he munched away at his grayish ball of... something, leaving Ratatouille even more determined to find great food in Paris even at the cost of his own life. And then there were moments when my corn-trip became real: I know it sounds like I lost my mind, but rivulets of butterscotch, peppercorn, and Mazola oil came flying out of the screen, engulfing the audience and myself as I sat near the door but could not make for it since I was firmly planted on my seat, being drowned in Life's Precious Lessons -- the Moral of the Story. It became hard to breathe and for a second or two I caught myself choking and sobbing a little. I counted the tears -- two of them, neatly creeping down my cheeks. And then the movie was over. Of course, when I met my friend for dinner, reeking of corn, she asked me, ""So what did you watch today?"" I told her, ""CARS."" She asked me, ""And...?"" I said, ""I absolutely loved it. It's fake as a pair of silicone tomatoes on your average Californian wannabe actress/model, pre-planned and pre-packaged in advance, but I loved it."" Of course, she didn't believe me for one second, but there it is. I do. I like it. Even if five people wrote the screenplay, and it runs just short of two hours, and the opening sequence, ""One Man Band,"" is as marvelously cynical as CARS is a portentuous pile of ho-hum.

The same children didn't blink or go to the bathroom during ""polar Express"", ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice age"". My humble interpretation is that this movie is OK for adults, but it failed to capture the eluding magic that catches children's attention.

Indycar racing is dull and almost unknown to Europeans- which does not help. Many of the other clichés are again almost unknown outside the US of A, and even as a Brit who has lived in the midwest they rankle. Combine the two and you have a film where gnawing my own legs off provided a superior alternative. My 9 year old twins loved it.

327,7.0,"Cars proves to be good family entertainment. Even in 2006, the animation was well done by Pixar, and with a great style, the film is absolutely appealing visually. Character design is good, too. The on the nose comedy concerning car stereotypes is somewhat overdone, though, especially when jokes are unnecessarily repeated. Fortunately, the characters themselves are all likable as each has a distinct personality. Wilson's McQueen is certainly a fun lead, between his full arc and intriguing personality. In this fish out of water storyline, his dynamics with the rest of the cast provide for many laughs and decent emotion, as well. True themes are therefore displayed through the journey the central character undergoes. Still, the subplots feel half-baked and the emotional payoffs not entirely deserved. This is in addition to the plot holes, or at least questions left unanswered, that plague the audience's conscious while watching. Altogether, the plot is either predictable or conflicts seem to happen so plot can move forward. These issues are undeniable, yet how the writers close out the picture is admirable in its focus on character growth and the themes laid out. Truly, it's just a satisfactory end to the story. Not to be forgotten, the soundtrack is very good. Overall, Cars is a great film for families to watch together, even with its many flaws.",1

Nice moral ending, some things in life are more important than winning, is not enough after such a long and boring middle. Not appropriate for kids under 8 unless you want to raise them to be unfeeling and mean.

It hits all the right notes, and the original score is used so sparingly, making the moments that it's there that much more special. The scene where Lightning and Sally are cruising through the valley, the animation, the unique ''car-ified'' design of the world, winding roads, combined with the music just make me completely immersed like nothing else.",1
340,9.0,"It has become a family tradition in our household to watch each new Pixar film on opening day... and often that means pulling the kids out of school for a ""family excursion"". Pixar never lets us down. A good reason for this is probably the length of time that they spend on a masterpiece making sure it is just right. Cars is no exception. I especially liked some of the big scenes that need to be seen in a theatre to do them justice. And it goes without saying that the animation is superb. Watch out for the history of Pixar films that weave their way in here and there... very cool. All-in-all a worthy feature with a feature length (2 hours) - Got my money's worth on this one. From adult, to teen to child... a movie everyone can love. Bring on Ratatouille!!",1
341,10.0,"""Cars"" (2006), when this movie first came out, I thought to myself: ""all right, this is kind of silly. Maybe Pixar is running out of ideas?"" But, when I saw the plot synopsis, I thought that the story was interesting and that convinced me to go see it in the theater. Now, I wouldn't consider it to be a home run. But, it's certainly not the worst Pixar movie. ""Cars"" has an excellent story, phenomenal voice acting, stunning animation and a great soundtrack. The plot is, A big-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen winds up in Radiator Springs, where he inadvertently gets in trouble. From there, he learns to embrace life and value friendship. That's a story that has been expressed countless times before. However, in the scope of this film, it is presented in a different way. Probably the most refreshing aspect of the plot, is that the lessons are laid out in tidbits, rather than just on the nose. I won't go into any extra details about the plot. But, at the end of the day, it has a nice payoff. My biggest nitpick, is the overall concept of the storyline. Cars and other vehicles have taken the place of human beings! That does sound a bit far-fetched, especially to this day. I remember thinking back in 2006: ""come on, this is Pixar! They couldn't have done any better?"" That being said, they did as much as they could with the material they had to work with. Had some other studio made this film, it may have crashed and burned. But, Pixar is usually able to rebound with a lackluster concept. Probably the biggest thing that earns the story a pass from me, is because I do laugh at certain parts every time I watch it. The funniest part, in my opinion, is when Mater the tow truck drives on the ""new road"". That part may only last a few seconds, but I can watch that scene on repeat, and laugh harder and harder whenever I see it. As for the voice acting, it's just as great as the plot. The whole cast nails their respectable characters, and really help bring them to life! Finally, the soundtrack composed by Randy Newman is excellent. His film scores are usually well written and composed, and this one here is no different. ""Cars"" is a solid entry in the world of Pixar movies. It may not be their best film, but it's definitely worth watching once in a while though. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Now, I understand a film like this may not be for everyone. But, if you love vehicles, then this movie might appeal to you even more. At the time of it's release, I considered it to be Pixar's biggest dud. However, that didn't last, as in 2011, that distinction went to a new Pixar film. Any way, if you haven't seen ""Cars"", drive on over to see it today. Or else, you might find yourself trapped in Radiator Springs!",1

As it was, we found this effort a total let-down. The plot is tired and loaded with hackneyed sentimentality. You could see where it was going almost before it got under way. The characters were little more than one-dimensional clichés and the dialogue was so lazy, it seemed to have been written by robots. There was just one redeeming gag that made me laugh out loud, a Shakespearean allusion that would have been over the heads of all the kids in the audience, and probably would have been wasted on most of the adults! What on earth has happened to the all-round brilliant Pixar of Bug's Life, Toy Story and Finding Nemo?

344,,"""CARS"" (2006): I'm just going to repeat myself: Pixar CANNOT be beaten in the visual animation & cartoon story market. The visuals are SUPERB. Detailing, light/shadow, texture, perspective, wit, and characters with soul, make their (predictable theme) stories pure pleasure. Within the stories are the family/societal lessons we expect from Disney (whenever they've been at their best), and, they (the Corporation) SEEM to have the SENSE to leave the Pixar people alone. Pixar approaches a project as MORE than just ""another cartoon"", and the results are there to see and feel. Not since the Fleischer brothers of the 20's, 30's, and 40's, has anyone been more innovative and thorough. Pixar kicks everyone's butts - including the good looking but generally empty products of their main competitor. To make the comparison, rent ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz"". Watch them both on one night. ""Antz"" first. That says it all. ""CARS"" is a must-own for me.",1
345,2.0,"Possibly the worst film by Pixar to date. It started off OK but drug so bad in the middle that even the most immature prepubescent member of the audience couldn't find anything to laugh at. Thank God they finally threw in a fart so someone in the audience got a chuckle. It seemed to attempt at tugging on your feelings rather than just making you laugh which is what a cartoon comedy is supposed to do. Or so I thought. Larry the Cable Guy carried the entire film and his character wasn't all that funny. I really wanted to like this movie and so did my kids but we walked out disappointed. Animation was very good, as always, but the script just absolutely stunk the place up. I wouldn't even recommend this one for rental but I would definitely avoid going to the theater to see this ""wreck"" of a film. (Pun intended)",0
346,6.0,"As soon as I saw the teaser trailer for Pixar's next installment ""Cars"", I just knew they wouldn't be able to pull off the magic again. After actually seeing the film I found out they did, well, kinda-sorta. What I love most about John Lasseter's ""Toy Story"" was it's engaging premise, characters, and situations, wholly unbelievable yet you willingly went along with it. The result? It was immensely entertaining, even moving. With it's on point humor and 'realism', the film succeeded with leaps and bounds, not necessarily requiring an amazing story to launch it into brilliance. I immediately realized that making automobiles with windshield eyes and mouths truly exist in their own world would be a challenge. Many children have a natural fascination with cars, but not really in such the way it is done here. Pixar's usual amazing imagery does ""Cars"" a big service, but in the end, Lasseter manages to keep audiences engaged by humanizing the likes of Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy. You really get the feeling that this film was nurtured with the same TLC as some of Pixar's finest, but the subject matter, and certainly the clichéd story, force the film to to run out of gas. Some of the characterizations are more matching to much of the non-Pixar releases; human ethnicity based and that being the reason for the laughs. Also missing is the correct amount of wit, inventiveness, and hilarious dialogue such as in ""Toy Story"", although it comes in sporadic amounts with hits and misses. ""Toy Story"" of course had nostalgia on it's side and cleverly transformed that into a play representation that both adults and kids could really enjoy. I'm afraid much of our emotional connection to cars are limited. And so, I respect ""Cars"", even though I really think it isn't that good, at least as compared to Pixar's other films. With Nascar boring unfortunates dragged to it's confines by interested fans around America, it is truly a miracle that ""Cars"" succeeds in the way that it does. It's good for one ride, but it's impact is lacking for another spin.",1
347,8.0,"The sad reality is that the great American car has lost the one thing that made it most appealing: personality.

352,6.0,Pixar have the tendency to make you fall in love with their characters. I will be honest I did struggle to find that connection with the characters in this film but I did still enjoy it. It had a solid storyline and some good moments but still for a Pixar movie it was below par,1
353,1.0,"I'm a huge fan of animation movies, especially Pixar work. I've followed them up since Luxo Jr, Tin Toy, etc and probably seen everything since. I must say I'm quite disappointed with Cars. I couldn't be less interested in Nascar racing, but what it matters is the story, right? So, let's see what we have here: a cocky young boy that only cares about himself, ready to learn a life lesson from the experienced but troubled old man. And then characters: It looks like they just grab one from each category and mix them up with the blender. We have the silly, the shy, the old lady, the ""couple of Italians"", the soldier, the cheater, you name it, it's there Some might see this as an amazing creativity, but to me it's only lucking so much of story that they're just adding whatever character, having saying the line that corresponds to that profile, and they're happy with it. My favorite one is in the old town, each time something happens, the camera pans from side to side so each character say whatever comment suits the profile. It gets extremely boring and predictable after the first run Then again, the casting. How could the story be any different if Owen Wilson is playing the young guy, and Paul Newman the old guy. Haven't we seen them a million times playing the exact same roles? Please. I normally don't enjoy waiting until the end titles to see something new. And what's up with the names? Toys, Bugs, Monsters, Cars? Maybe if they weren't so obsessed in making sure their movies can sell all type of merchandising they could focus in writing a better story. Not that they shouldn't try to make money, but I definitely prefer when they have a great movie to justify all. Pixar to me is all about innovation, creativity and imagination, just not this time. I should have left after One Man's Band short, which is a perfect example of what they know how to do. My guess for the next title: ""Socks!""",0

I guess the let down after all the hype of another ""Incredibles"" type production was too much for me to forgive. The film pretty much follows the lines of ""Doc Hollywood,"" and I knew the ending just from the self-serving attitude in the beginning scenario of ""Lightening"". Michael J.

The story of racing rookie Lightning McQueen thinks his career is a walk in the park, when he suddenly ends up in a town called Radiator Springs and meets some particular faces, and learns that there is more to life than gold medals. Now, this is something I call completely inspirational. I thought ""Cars"" was an excellent movie from Pixar, and another movie that uses fiction to teach real-life lessons. And the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Keaton, Larry the Cable Guy, and an appearance by racing star Richard Petty was all quite impressive. I thought the story was well true to life, it's another Pixar flick with a big heart, and it was actually pretty funny. I felt that the movie really taught that everything else in life is more important than winning a lot of races. I love the animation, the heart, the characters, and all of those racing scenes. This movie just makes you want to go out there and race to glory. Wow, what a funny pun! Now, it's time to rev up the engines and head back home!

I was already very excited since I got some stickers with something (I don't exactly remember) so I wanted to know more about this film. It was really visually appealing to see. Although I didn't know English back then so I was only interested in the races and seeing Lightning McQueen and Mater do weird things (and also Lightning McQueen building the road was also pretty interesting to me somehow; it still is). Ever since then I had seen this film every single time it came on Disney (there was a time when the Pixar movies were being shown a lot on Sundays).,1

365,8.0,"Cars is weaker Pixar, but still adequate. A stranded bigshot humbled in a small town is a common story, yet Cars executes well. First, Lightning McQueen's character arc is believable and touching, softening his cliche. His romance with Sally is contrived, but the characters are purposeful enough to make it forgivable. Next, the humor is occasionally childish, yet also lands at a decent rate. Plus, the supporting characters are deepened by emotional undertones.

What else could you expect from Pixar during their Golden Age? There are much more pop culture references and adult jokes than I remember as a kid. The voice acting fits well with the characters and feels fun. The story is sweet and has a good lesson, especially for kids -- don't go so fast that you forget to smell the flowers. The only part of the movie I fail to wrap my head around is why exactly the cars had to be sentient.

However-and this is perhaps the ultimate irony about the success of Pixar -as inventive as the animation has been-and it has been fantastic, their films have been most characterized by intelligent and witty storytelling. This might say as much about the paucity of intelligently written films currently but nevertheless, Pixar has become well-known more for the intelligence of its screenplays.

387,9.0,"Pixar's latest animated film has been good. Very good, in fact - though it is just another one of the swarm of animated films that invaded cinemas in 2006, the idea to have cars as talking, living characters is an ingenious and original one that makes a nice change from the usual talking-animal fare. The visual effects in this film are neat - the cars actually gleam and the colours are immensely saturated, which makes for a very colourful flick which kids will enjoy looking at. The sound is also nice as well - especially in the cinemas. But while this film more than delivers on the visual and audio scales, there's actually a brilliant story to be found with it. The film is full of interesting new characters that the audience will quickly identify with - from the elusive 50s auto Doc Hudson to the rusty tow-truck Mater. The film has quite a touching story that has happened in real life - how big famous people's fortunes take a tumble and they are reduced to small-town life, but quickly realise the joys of it and let their new buddies help them make their way to the top again. Though the film isn't exactly a laugh-a-minute riot on the comedy scales, it is something very different - these cars are people. Their losses in the past are brought to us in a touching way that may bring back memories to people who have suffered similar losses in life. Cars isn't realistic and you won't need to explain it to young kids or start a long discussion about it at the tea table, but it still is a bloody good movie, and we don't care about realism any more. Pixar aren't about to lose their throne as animation kings yet. This new world has two sides to it - a side of celebrities and paparazzi and one side of small-town folk, very much like in real life. And these two worlds brilliantly clash with the arrival of cocky Lightning McQueen in the small town of Radiator Springs. McQueen has to accept his new fate and use his new buddies, who he initially doesn't like but soon needs them more than ever. Some could say Cars was overlong, but there's so much story to tell and so much character to cram in that it is actually the ideal length. A bit more interaction between the celebrity and ordinary-car worlds would have been nice, though to be fair, this film did revolve around exile, loss, and friendship, and you'll be so caught up in the hugely-original premise of romance between cars that you won't care anyway.

The predictable plot just made me yawn, since every little detail is easy to notice right in the beginning of the narrative, from the mysteries of Doc Hudson for the obvious final decision of McQueen. Even if the moral teachings are a law in Disney's movies, in this case, they are too silly and exaggerated, and are included just to redeem characters that could be more interesting and ""credible"" without that quick personality changes. Talking about credibility, the visual of the cars is somewhat ugly. Not that the animation is bad, for it certainly isn't. But it is difficult to feel a human touch in the cars. Because of their different, inanimate shape, they don't look like characters. I didn't feel moved by any character, in the whole movie.

It's important to get to love the real world and show respect to the ones that may be the opposite type of person than you are.

Our daughter sees it as a story of the acquisition of humility. Thomas the two and a half year old sees ""Cars"" as ""race cars!"" and endures the other parts with a good cheer. My wife and I enjoy it as a nostalgic Route 66 eulogy, but after seeing it so often it has become a love story: love of a race car for a Porshe; love of small town America; love of the West; love of automobiles; love of friends. Without being ""preachy"" this movie accomplishes so many things on so many levels! It also has hilarious cameos by most unlikely people as well as tiny insightful touches that keep ""Cars"" fresh even after marathon compulsory watching with a grandson.

403,7.0,"Cars appears to be the odd one out in Pixar's initial run, in that it wasn't meet with as much acclaim as its previous efforts. It was still well received by most people, but many agreed that it didn't push the boundaries or really try something inventive like the other films. I kind of have the same reaction, in that I think it's a good film but it's certainly missing somethings that could push to greatness. The premise of a world populated only by cars is a creative one, but it's something that has been done before and even the idea of a big fish trapped in a small pond has been done numerous times by other films. Maybe that's the issue with the film, it does these ideas well yet never does anything special with them.",0
404,6.0,"Cars used to be one of my favorites as a kid, this whole thing was pretty nostalgic.<br /><br />But it definitely doesn't hold up in my opinion, as a whole it feels lackluster especially when compared to the previous Pixar films. The animation is of course great because it's Pixar, but feels nowhere near as innovative as the past films.<br /><br />The story feels like a huge standstill because of the road McQueen has to fix and doesn't really go anywhere until the last 30 minutes of the film, the racing portions are fun though.<br /><br />Personally I don't think Owen Wilson is that great when it comes to voice acting, he's definitely not bad but it's pretty average in my opinion. The people I think are great in this are Michael Keatons ""Chick Hick"" and even Paul Newman's ""Doc Hudson"", Keatons performance just seems like he's having tons of fun and Newman's performance feels more serious but full of life at the same time.<br /><br />And of course, Cars has a pretty iconic soundtrack.

The technology is amazing but after the whiz bang of the first scene it didn't add anything to the film. The characters are very simple and not funny except for the Italian cars. Every part of the story is un-original and borrowed from other mediocre movies. I don't understand why writers of kids movies always fall back on the ""capitalism is evil and mean people are greedy"" plot when they run out of new ideas. Pixar is going to make money on this, but I doubt that they are proud of it. Every other Pixar movie I have seen has had a great story and still watchable after a few dozen viewings.

Okay ! it's a film for children, great, but when it just has some crappy predictable and moralistic end (they're teaching our children that friendship is a good thing). I mean, compare that with Toy Story, or even Snow White, and you see that films for children can be superb without having to give a pompous lesson, some of the scenes really made me feel sick (the hero and his gal riding in the forest with silly music, pathetic). AND it's not even that funny, the scripwriterS (yes, more than one) only managed to crack about five jokes in two long hours of SFX and cheesy romance.

Without people with hands how do the buildings get built and the cars (again without hands) repair each other? This movie just does not work on so many levels. On the other hand the voice actors did a great job! I love Bonnie Hunt and of course Paul Newman, Katherine Helmond and George Carlin. Jeremy Piven playing the same character again?

As the light reflects of the cars it seems so real and an hour through the film I forgot it was it was an animation. Mater (fanastically voiced by Larry the cable guy) really lightens up the film because all films need a comedian. The only problems about cars is that it does drag on a bit I have never seen such a long animation film before, and in a movie there should be a bad guy or someone evil dude they didn't have any of them. I think the story is very similar to over the hedge if you replace cute animals with motor veichles, because Lightnin and Rj both discover that they can have a better life with the other cars or the other animals.

So, it had an okay storyline, some sweet voice acting, and AWESOME animation, but it was just kind of a let-down after The Incredibles and Finding Nemo.

I'm sure this new addition from the Pixar pen (Digital, I'm sure) will make it's costs and then some. But before I get into actually reviewing this film, I want to part my observation from the spectator side. I realized this was going to have lots of kids seeing it is actually for kids, but for a kids movie, there was a lot of restlessness in the seats. It wasn't engaging them as a cartoon should engage a kid. Either ADHD is at an all time epidemic level, or maybe they were bored with the first part of the film. One mother actually took their 5 year old to the side isle and let them run up and down the steps. A parent behind me tried desperately to ""shhhsssh"" their 1st grader into submission. It didn't work. Even during the latter third of the movie, the conversations amongst the kids seemed more about everyday things that the movie. So, what was the target audience of this film? NASCAR enthusiast? Chevron toy car collectors? Pixar CGI enthusiast (I grimly raise my hand)? A little bit of everything, but not enough on one thing in particular. The one thing that went against this cartoon was it's running time. At 4 minutes less than 2 hours, no kid should be expected to sit through something like this. The apparent nature in kids is to move around and be active. So, this is testing even the most committed parent with a 3 - 6 year old. However, cars is still Pixar, and charming in it's own way. I have to admit, I gaped in awe as McQueen speeds through the mountain tunnel to reveal the waterfall on the other side. Particularly realistic, it could match anything Yosemite Park has to offer, and to think it took down entire computer server when they tried to render the shot in real time, you know they were jammin those bytes by the millions. The sheer magnitude of the study of reflection, color and texture warrants applaud all by it's self. It was a simple plot: Car gets lost, car meets girl... err, chick-car umm, future soccer mom... (whatever) , car ends up making lots of new best friends and setting up shop in depressed town of Radiator Springs. Mater (Larry, The Cable Guy) really pitches his voices to create a great beat up buck toothed tow truck, even managing to slip in a ""get 'er done"" near the end of the movie. Funny thing about this film: it really has no villain, no promoter of evil... all there is is competitive egos. Man, sometimes that can be enough too! I didn't mind the corny name droppings, but the pace of this film is uneven, and even drags for quite a while. Happily, it picks up pace though in the final third, and the action resumes to what one expects of Pixar. If you see it, stay for the credits: They didn't do out-takes, but seems to snip in some funny stuff that one could have imagined the characters doing in the side lines... especially the car versions of previous Pixar films. I would recommend you not take any kids under 5 or 6 simply because some people may be really involved with the film, and a young kid not engaged in a movie enough to shut them up would make a bad viewing for some. Not me, of course!",0

So when a later motorway mishap lands McQueen in the derelict town of Radiator Springs, where the most spectacular auto is an emotionally unstable fire engine and a day when holidaying people-carriers pop through is considered eventful, it's hard not to yearn for the heady roar of the race track.

So me and my whole family went to the drive-in and saw Cars and we all LOVED it! The movie was great. It had excellent dialogue, incredible animation, and a really good story. Put all these things together, and you get a really awesome movie! Watching Cars was one of the best times I have had at the movies in a VERY long time.",1
466,4.0,"I took my four year old to see Cars and we were so disappointed. My daughter has loved Pixar movies since she was about two and a half. We have watched Toy Story 1 and 2, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., A Bug's Life and The Incredibles over and over. Those movies are so engaging. We were about five minutes into Cars and my daughter turned to me and said ""Mom, when is the movie going to start?"" It went right over her head. I think the plot and action were not accessible to young kids. What do they know about cars and the history of Route 66? The theater was relatively crowded and no one was laughing. The plot seemed very tired and predictable. Also, I thought the cars seemed oddly lifeless even though they were moving with great energy around the screen. Pixar was able to make fish seem warm and cuddly, but,in my opinion, they were unable to create that kind of magic with Cars. After my daughter finished her M&M's, she became too bored to stay, so we left before it was over.",0
467,8.0,"It took me a few times of watching Cars before it became a delight to see it. In fact, I started off feeling a shade disappointed by the movie, feeling that the humor in some places flopped because they tried too hard to be funny and feeling that the message was clichéd.",0

Concept wise the movie is really strong but script is lacking. Movie is predictable and the story keeps stretching like elastic. There are some nice moments and some gimmicks to make you smile but where is the magic of Pixar like we had in earlier movies 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo' . The movie visually is very appealing and kids gonna surely love it. Even for grown ups its a nice ride but not a great one. Surely is one time watchable easily with family.

You know what? It was just actually kinda good. Sold storyline, great animation and modeling, I'd go see this again with my 6 year old sister. It was just a pretty good movie with a lot to see and point out. I loved how the cars shiny bodywork glistened off the big screen. I love all Pixar movies, and this one still wasn't the best, but like most of the old Pixars I enjoyed when I was a kid, this was a decent film. I'm glad that pixar still makes lots of movies, and lots of good ones. I will keep an eye on Pixar, and see some more of their movies. I noticed a new ""Ratouille"" coming out, and I think this will be just like Cars, horrible ads, but I think it will turn out to be a solid film. Keep up the hard work Pixar, lots of kids love your movies, and keep making those animated shorts! Those are great too.",1

We were privy to a couple inside jokes, living amongst the racing atmosphere that IS Charlotte, but even if we hadn't gotten that extra little chuckle, there's definitely plenty to find. Not just for kids. Kids will like the cute characters, and bright colors, adults will like it simply because it's just plain entertaining without having to dumb down to appeal to kids. You'll find yourself wanting to find the next twisty backboard to get to your next destination. Watch for all kids of cameo's, and it's too bad IMDb doesn't include a picture of the animated character as well-- it's not always easy to remember what the names are once you get home. Owen's good, Newman is classic, if a little flat (I applaud him for just plain staying active and leaving his house!), but it's really Larry the Cable Guy's movie-- newfound appreciation for that one-- and ""tow-mater"" is a multi-layered pun. Not only on the fact that he's a tow truck, but also his ""they call me tater salad"" bit-- Overall, highly entertaining, just try not to speed too much on the way home....",1

We've listened to the sound track so many time that my 6-year-old grandson and I can do a duet on ""Life's a Highway"". I have managed to collect what I think is a complete set of McDonald's CARS cars ... and I mean complete - all eye-position variations included. (Does anyone have a definitive list of them? I've got about 30-35 cars in this set...) I'll be going to my first stock car race tonight. I don't know what it is about this film, but it certainly has caught my imagination. Most folk may not go as nuts as I have - but I think CARS is one of the best fun films I have ever seen! Out of 5 stars, I'd give it a 10!",1
474,6.0,"I saw this movie over two years ago when it first came out, and I must admit, I was slightly disappointed. The Incredibles had just came out the year before and that movie blew me away. Pixar was at the top of their game when they made that one, but Cars doesn't come close to the Incredibles. The movie is about a red car who becomes lost in a small town along Route 66. While he is there he meets new friends and falls in love. The cars themselves aren't very creative. Imagine the Chevron cars with eyes on their windshields instead of their headlights. The movie also lacks in its soundtrack. Instead of original, classy songs like ""You've Got a Friend In Me"" by Randy Newman and ""If I Didn't Have You"" by Billy Crystal and John Goodman the main theme is a terrible country song by the band ""Rascal Flatts"". The song is commercial and very unoriginal. Usually Pixar doesn't put music by popular, well-known bands into their movies but puts something different. That song pretty much knocked 2 stars off of the movie. The movie isn't terrible, but it isn't one of my favorites. If you aren't familiar with Pixar but are interested in seeing some of their movies, check out better flicks, like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and of course.... The Incredibles. If you have kids that are into motorized vehicles, rent this. If you don't, there is no talking to you. I would expect this from a company like Dreamworks or 20th Century Fox, but not Pixar.",0

Of course you get racing with big racing names doing the voice overs in each country.

Firstly, the disappointment: Pixar has taken a well worn genre (the old dog and rookie upstart routine) and instead of breaking through the barriers that constrict the genre, they have merely allowed themselves to follow its guidelines to a tee. It has thoroughly predictable characters and plot line and, at least to start with, the character of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is annoying and cocky as hell. It's not a good start.",0

I loved the sound design in this film as the sound in movies is usually not given the attention it deserves as there would be no movie without the sound. Kids movies always tend to teach morals or a lessen as well.

The characters are deep and the story is intriguing. As a kid this was probably my favorite film ever, so maybe some childhood nostalgia is mixed in with this review.<br /><br />At its core, this movie isn't about racing, which is what I adore about this movie. It's a typical coming of age story except it's told with race cars.<br /><br />However, this film isn't super spectacular like other Pixar films, because it fails to obtain the magic and joy within them, and instead focuses on appealing to Children ie: a bunch of potty humor.<br /><br />That doesn't make this film terrible though, and it's still a fun family film that adults can find enjoyment out of.",0

Now this is why I think it doesn't deserve 10/10: I wanted to know all the characters, so it felt kinda empty at times that I don't really know anything about the other characters, and because I just didn't feel like it deserves the full rating.

I would recommend this to all parents, you'll love it as much as the kids. Owen Wilson and Paul Newman are great in their respective roles. Wilson shines as the arrogant young race car and Newman delivers his usual A-One performance as the wise old car.

Such issues that take center stage here are family, friendship and love, with a slice of social commentary on the side.

Thought it was pretty predictable, and I have the same problem with cars as with fish (read: Nemo): I just don't care about them the same way I care about people/superheroes (my favorite movie from Pixar is the Incredibles), monsters or even bugs. In any case, Cars had little chance with me: I had a strong bad feeling about this one ever since I found out about it. I was hoping they could prove me wrong, but for me it just did not work.

Apart from that,they loved it too.Particularly the two oldest who are hardcore racing fans. ""Cars"" is about a new,flashing rookie racing car named McQueen(the Steve reference is for parents probably;).On his way to California for a very important race he takes an involuntary detour to a town where time has stood still since the fifties,no one stops there anymore,and to him the inhabitants are just hillbillies.And what was a very reluctant stay becomes a new life experience for him,with new friends and new values.Winning isn't everything. The animation is stunning,it's almost incredible that it's all ""just animated"". I have only seen it with Swedish voice-overs(because of my kids),but I'd love to see the original version too.

The story revolves around a rookie race car learning that life isn't about where you're going, but how you get there. Now I'll admit, last fall when I first heard about this movie I completely wrote it off as being utterly preposterous. Why? Simply because the idea of talking cars didn't seem entertaining in the least. It actually wasn't until the day before its release I said, wow, I think Disney's got something here. (Which only proved to be true after seeing it the next day.) John Lassester, the man who took us into the world of toys in 'Toy Story' and on a search for a young clown fish in 'Finding Nemo' has done it once again. First off, there's Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson) funny and irresistibly lovable new best friend, Mater. (Larry the Cable Guy) He adds to 'Cars' what Scrat the squirrel does in the 'Ice Age' films. Now don't get me wrong, many of the other characters featured in the film are plenty likable, but Mater is the glue that brings it all together. Also in 'Cars' the animation is superb. It doesn't have the same style or look the other Pixar films have. I don't really know how to describe it, but it's certainly something.",1

They studio has always had novel ideas, but the action sequences seem to fall flat in CG fare and the kid friendly comedy never really connects with me. Their movies have always been solid, but never great, until the incredibles came. The Incredibles was a fantastic movie and made me thing the studio had turned a new leaf. I was very excited about the idea, especially since it seems to be somewhat based on an old Disney animated film that I loved as a child. Well, it seems Pixar is back to their old tricks, it's not really a bad thing, just nothing new. The movie sports the best CG work I've seen, Pixar tops themselves again, and the film features great voice work. I read a review likening this to Doc Hollywood and thats appropriate. I really enjoyed the beginning of the film, although the laughs seem to be few and far between in the beginning. The middle is where things crawl to a snails pace, i realize character development is essential, but I could have been done in a smarter less time consuming approach. Luckily, the last 30 minutes or so are a blast, fun, fast, and heartfelt. I really enjoyed ""mater"" voiced by Larry the cable guy, although I felt the ""fart"" joke was lame and WAYYYYY over used. As always a solid message is delivered in a family-friendly way with some fast action and laugh added along the way. The only thing that really hinders this movie is that the beginning and middle should have had more laughs and the movie should have been shortened at least 20 to 25 minutes. I think 2 hour kids films is a little too long for most kiddies, even the child I sat too was losing interest near the middle. Still I recommend it, a solid film.",1

Now that I'm older I realize that the story is definitely weak compared to the other Pixar movies, but what makes up for it are the characters, animation, voice acting, humor, the music especially Our Town by James Taylor, an emotional scene, and the movie's tone.

And just remembering the rapt attention she gave to the full movie is going to be a cherished memory. See it in theater, rent it, buy it. It deserves to be in your personal videotheque. ENJOY!",1

Pixar as usual produces some stunning animation in this movie with lovely grass, polished metal surfaces and a movie filled with beautiful colors and detailed backgrounds. Well done animators.",1
522,6.0,"This is a good film. It looks great, the acting is well done and it's directed competently. But when you compare it to other Pixar films (at the time) it just doesn't come close. I liked it well enough as a kid, though it was always my least favourite of the 2000s Pixar catalogue.",1
523,10.0,"What a delightful story! The plot of this Disney/Pixar animated film is about a race car who, while seeking fame and fortune, finds along the way that meaningful friendship is more important than anything material.",0
524,5.0,"Yes, in this year 2020 it was that I saw Cars, a film of which I heard excellent comments and that I no longer wanted to postpone. In short, I was disappointed, I thought it would be fun, original because of cars, but it was not like that, I think it is quite tired to see the same story of the good character, who gets some friends who help him, who crosses obstacles and achieves success why?",1
525,5.0,"Cars, like other Pixar films, is pretty to look at if nothing else. Unlike other Pixar films, there is no emotional identification with the protagonist, McQueen. Instead we are filled with the typical Hollywood ideal that ""things were better in the past."" Like other animated movies in general, there are cheddery-cheesy songs and about 15 ""time-passing"" or ""relationship-building"" montages. It was distracting most of the time, and predictable. There were also some scenes, especially involving Larry the Cable Guy, that were there for their giggle factor, not their substance. This also distracts us from the message, if any, the movie is trying to get across. The short of it is that the movie is too long for most young children to sit through (at 2:05 hours). This, coupled with a very slow moving plot, is enough to turn any youngster to mutiny in the theater. Believe me, I experienced a few.",0
526,10.0,"OK, I watched it and loved. Unfortunately I got sick watching it in the movies last summer, but eventually that year I got to see it again, rented then I got it for Christmas. Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson, Starsky and Hutch) is a cocky racecar that lands in Radiator Springs and meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, Git-R-Done) and also falls in love with Sally (Bonnie Hunt, Cheaper by the Dozen). Unfortunately he also has to deal with Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, unknown films), who really hates him, but then later realizes that he's a really known racecar and has to deal with a super cocky racecar, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, Beetlejuice). It spoofs off of NASCAR actually. I loved the quotes ""Morning, sleeping beauty"", ""He did what in his cup?!"" and ""McQueen and Sally, parked beneath a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-T"". I would of listed the other quotes, but I don't have time. But anyways, rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it on DVD. Watch the Mater and Ghostlight. It's really funny XD.",1
527,1.0,"This movie was awful, I felt dumber after seeing it. The whole movie was slow, and the plot was just stupid. They have you believe your going to see a movie about race cars, and then all of a sudden a race car is paving streets? This was a typical Disney movie focused on a moral of the story. The race cars are the shinny paint of this movie, but the plot is just a rusty chassis at best. Lots of fart jokes, and a few one liners, no adult humor, all basic burping, farting jokes. I would never watch this movie again, and my girl friend agreed( she loves pixar movies and hated this movie too) Movie in some parts could have been edited, during these slow parts the kids in the theater became anxious, and started crying. Movie should have been no more than 1hr and 15 mins long (this is a 2 hr long movie!! way too long for kids) to keep it from getting ""dry""",0

About 15 minutes of tape, at the cost of the equivalent of some 30$ at the time. Great stuff! I've been following Pixar ever since, bought and enjoyed all their productions (partly on VHS, partly on DVD) and I just don't get what's happening now. A Pixar movie that mainly consists of storytelling errors! What on earth made them think they could make this ""cars only"" item work? I really don't see who could enjoy this thing, apart from a bunch of car racing aficionados... Incredible... and a big disappointment!",1
529,6.0,"I saw the movie with my wife and kids and would have to say it was the adults that probably enjoyed it most. It was visually stunning as per their usual standard but the story was just a bit above the littlies, perhaps too subtle for them. Kids today maybe more perceptive than I all those years ago but the majority of the little ones in the theatre became noticeably restless about an hour in and then struggled to maintain attention until the final race when there was a lot more colour, movement and sound.",1

However, I can now!When I first entered the theater room, I saw both teenagers and little kids with their parents their too. It was something like a 7:45 showing or somewhere around there. I could tell that everyone was excited to see this movie. It was a truly excellent film. It has some humor that is meant for kids, and some for adults, but anyone can laugh at any of the jokes. It definitely deserves its G rating, for it was not inappropriate at all! The fact that the story is very easy to follow and you understand everything, is probably only one of the reasons people love this film. The animation is incredible!! When you watch this movie, you don't feel like, okay this is a silly little movie with talking cars. You find yourself in the world of cars. And it's a great world to be in. The fact that the characters all have real personalities is probably what traps you the most in the world of cars. Everything in this movie is just great!! ",1
531,10.0,"i couldn't wait to see this movie and i was so surprised how enjoyable it was. as an adult i look forward to these movies as much as children. too often now movies are made thinking we need only to see bombs going off or seductive or erotic scenes, ( don't get me wrong, i enjoy them too). but animations such as cars gives you such a good smile and feel after watching it which what is missing these days. a very smooth story line which can easily be related in many other circumstances, beautiful animation. now that i have been so impressed with cars, i think i may get down to my local DVD store and start watching other animations i have not yet seen.......... do yourself a favor, go see this movie",1

534,7.0,"Not the best Pixar movie but still pretty great. Firstly, the animation as usual is gorgeous and incredible with a lot of details in the characters and setting. This movie also tells a pretty great story with great characters with clear personalities and I love the character development Lightning McQueen goes through. Not only does he learn to be a better racer but a better person as he learns to slow down and enjoy life otherwise he will miss the little things and that the destination is just as important as the journey. It's a great message with a great story and a great way of delivering it. I also love McQueen's dynamic between the other characters and this movie has a very exciting opening and climax, showing clearly the growth McQueen went through and it's very satisfying.",1
535,9.0,When I first saw this movie I didn't know if I would like it or not. It's just that it didn't get really good reviews but I disagreed this is another great movie from pixar. It's about a HOTSHOT rookie race car who first just cares about winning and getting awards. But he accidentally takes a wrong and goes down route 66 then he accidentally drives into the long lost town of Radiator Springs. Then he learns that there's more to life than winning and awards. That is pretty much the main plot of it. We will be seeing RATATOILLE soon and if there was another pixar after that I would think they would need to make more sequels of other Pixars besides Toy Story. Like I said it's another great movie from Pixar if you get a chance to watch it don't miss it.,1
536,,"Looks like Disney's habit of ""borrowing"" from other, original sources has infected Pixar. The anthropomorphic vehicles are cute--until you remember animator Tex Avery's delightful ""One Cab's Family"" and ""Little Johnny Jet"" for MGM 54 years ago. Unfortunately, anyone in a position to fully appreciate this movie (who remembers the American highway between the end of World War II and the start of the Interstates) is probably going to remember them. My family DID have a Hudson. And I have to agree with Roger Ebert: Whereinhell is the Studebaker (they were made less that forty miles away)? Definitely several cuts below ""The Incredibles,"" and can we please lose the self-reflexive humor (the Pixar self-parodies at the end)? All of P's previous efforts were able to stand on their own without showcasing pop-culture references, especially obsolete ones from the fifties. I doubt anyone will get the Cozy Cone joke unless they've visited the Teich Postcard Museum in Wauconda, Illinois.",0

538,7.0,"This is my favorite movie. I often watch it with my little brother. there is not human being in this movie but there are many characters of marked, so I'm not bored watching it all the time because they are like human. McQueen is a genius. He takes no account of advice for him by his teammate and don't thanks for them at first. So he is so bad. Therefore, he seems to be lonely. However, he changes himself by the gentleness of cars little by little at the place where he gets lost and reaches by chance. I like such movie because I can watch the figure which the hero grows up. In last scene, McQueen is totally different from first five minutes. He has no friend, but he makes some excellent friends and finds best partner. This movie is very wonderful. If you never watch it, you should do.",1

First there is the CGI, It is really beautiful here! So well done that you forget that you are watching cgi anime. There are plenty of background textures, and details to keep anyone entertained.

True to Disney/Pixar form, the movie was as real and lifelike as any animation I have ever seen. The characters and story were incredible. Halfway through the movie I turned to the lady next to me and asked her if the story reminded her of anything. When she said no I told her that the storyline bore a slight resemblance to Doc Hollywood with Michael J. Fox (no,I will not spoil either movie plots for anyone), so if anyone else besides me noticed this please comment on it. Either way, Cars will go down in history right alongside Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., and The Incredibles.

545,10.0,"John Lasseter has done it. As Pixar's last movie under their own title they have accomplished something that most have not seen in other companies for a long time. The characters were fantastic and the story was just wonderful. There was just enough of everything to make the Cars capture everyone's hearts. I was proud to stand up at the end of the movie and clap for an amazing movie and as I did, many others followed. Even the credits was spectacular. Some hilarious, touching, happy, sad, proud moments all brought the movie together. My 4-year old and 8-year old brothers loved it too, immediately asking my dad to buy the DVD. I highly recommend this movie to any child, tween, teen, young adult, or even adults that are kids at heart. Cars would have to be the most finely-crafted movie I have ever seen. ",1

I was struck by the similarity of the cars in the movie to the Chevron cars, which I collect. The only complaint I have is the voice credits, which rolled by too fast for me to read. Now I have IMBb to thank for the information I missed. The story had plenty of action, and a little romance-and a moral: Be loyal to your friends. I am recommending this movie, which is certainly family friendly, to all the people I know who have been complaining about no decent movies to spend money on. We are both in our 70s, and within walking distance of our local theater complex, so we have the extra benefit of exercise.",1

556,6.0,"It had to happen. Nobody's perfect (or near perfect), but Pixar has been very close. Until now. This movie reeks of a poor Dreamworks production. Weak humor, too many topical (and dated) references, and a lead that is as weak as the acceleration on a Ford Pinto. Where have you gone Woody and Buzz, Marlon and Nemo, The Parr family, Sully and Stanley, and Flick and his band of lovable losers? You felt for these guys; you laughed at and with them. Not in Cars. I saw this movie with the ideal audience: A drive-in in rural Arkansas, full of kids and NASCAR fans on a (relatively) cool summer night. No laughs. The trucks (and a few cars) started immediately following the end of the movie. Pixar fans know that this can be a great chance to continue the movie, but know body cared. They just wanted to get out of there and pretend the last two hours hadn't happened. I should have trusted my gut about Cars, the feeling of dread that followed seeing the initial trailers and not been suckered in by undeservedly positive reviews. Would they have been this glowing for the same movie if it had been but out by someone other than Pixar: I don't think so. Bypass this wreck.",0

My opinion is that this Pixar's best animated feature film yet! Good voices, great design, and nice plot. Bravo, Pixar, you've just made a classic. It teaches a very important lesson. It's that you shouldn't be too cocky. No offense. Please take my advice. It's very helpful for when you want to see Cars. THE END.",1

And the eyes would be in the windshield & it would be thick to show my status wearing glasses and billed as ""Markie Brainard, Supercar"" and the 1953 Ford Victoria hardtop would fly & serve in Radator Springs as a supporter of the town & had a son would be a 2005 Hyundai Accent. Dubbed Marcus, Jr. The color of the car would be black with a white top. Lighting McQueen started out as a brash rookie & after his visit to Radator Springs he learned about things and learned what happens to a three time Piston Cup winner named Doc Hudson, voiced by the late, Paul Newman in one of his best roles. The final race did well when Chick takes The King out & Lighting saw what happened to The King, Strip Weathers and helped him finish the race instead of winning the Piston cup and that was an act of a hero. Chick did get the cup & still got dissed by his peers. However Lighting McQueen had a status of a winner for his act pushing The King to finish the race. Markie would explain to his son, Marcus, Jr. and told him ""You can win The Piston Cup like Chick did and still don't get any respect!"" There was some truth about interstate highways that bypassed some communties and they ended up becoming ghost towns. US 40 was a main way for many years until I-70 arrived and some communties became ghost towns. I liked the story and I liked Lighting's Courage saving The King & The Drive-In scene was good with car versions of Pixar's Hits. I wonder what ""The Boomobile"" would looked like? She would been a 1974 Dodge Monaco, black sedan. Matt Wagner's characters, Kevin Matchstick & Edsel would be cars & Kevin would be a black, 1968 Mustang with a white lighting bolt on the hood & Edsel would be a red & white, 1959 Edsel Corsair Sedan and her mouth is the vertical grille.

561,6.0,"I must admit, I wasn't expecting to enjoy seeing this film. I took my five-year-old nephew to see it today (he liked it...but he's five!) hoping to be pleasantly surprised like I was with ""The Incredibles"". No such luck. Whereas Brad Bird (The Incredibles writer/director) created and edgy, suspenseful, entertaining, and meaningful film, Pixar went back to its insipid Disney formula of mindless ""friendship and love is all you need for everything"" drivel with this one. Yes, the animation was stunning (do you expect anything less than the best from a Disney/Pixar film?) but as is usually the case with Disney films, they find a formula that people love and run it to the ground until it gets stale and people stop buying tickets. The whole movie centers around a civilization of cars with eyes, mouths and personalities. When I saw the previews while watching ""The Incredibles"" last year, I thought ""Wow, now even Pixar has run out of interesting ideas,"" and after watching this uninteresting film, I have to say I was dead-on. I wish Disney would start to look for more original films that aren't so saccharine sweet and incessantly family-pleasing. After force-feeding this junk to our children for so long, its no wonder obesity is plaguing American youth at record numbers. Maybe they should try something new, like telling stories about more diverse characters. Have a real Asian or Latin or African-American person write a screenplay and give Disney some long-needed variety. They can't possibly be content with peddling style over substance forever.

The story though it may have been typical in some point, it felt really good, the voicing was well done (especially from Larry The Cable Guy) and the soundtrack was the best, reviving old classics such as Life Is A Highway and Route 66 to original works like Behind The Clouds and Real Gone.

When they think of a theme they really run with it. Granted it may be a cartoon movie, but it really has something for everyone. I grew up in a small town. Everybody knew everyone. We all hung out at the local cafe. We took care of each other. Radiator Springs has that same feel. It is also heartwarming to watch the main character go from a self-centered jerk to someone you could actually call a friend.

It is definitely a movie kids will enjoy and adults can appreciate (and enjoy with the kids because it does bring out the kid in you).",1

The best way to gauge a movie is to ask whether you would see it again. No one voted yes. The two Toy Story (also Pixar) movies were gems and everyone enjoys watching them over and over at home--Cars will not be such a keeper. Not much in the way of a story and what was presented was much too long. Felt like the producers were getting paid by the frame. Of the voices, only Larry the Cable Guy put a smile on your face whenever he spoke. In other movies, the voices provide a huge lift--Eddie Murphy, as Donkey, in Shrek comes to mind right away; Tom Hanks and ""Cliff"" in Toy Story. Hopefully there won't be a sequel for Cars.",0
575,9.0,"A Fun light hearted animated comedy for all the family. Lightening McQueen (Wilson) was The new rookie in the race car world, but he was a force not to reckoned with as he proved when he came joint first with Chick Hicks (Keaton) the race car who always came runner up and The King (petty) the race car, who always comes first and is the sponsor of dinocco, but this is his last race as he is retiring after this. As the 3 Race cars became joint 1st another race is organized in California, with just them 3 racing for the piston cup. All 3 race cars then make their way to California; McQueen is desperate to get their first so he can hang out with the dinnoco team, so that after The King retires he will become more likely to be their new sponsor. He makes his truck driver Mack (Ratzneburge) Drive through the night without a rest, but unfortunately Mack falls a sleep while driving and McQueen falls out of the truck and ends up in the middle of no where. On his way to try and find Mack again McQueen gets lost and end up causing a lot of damage in a town called Radiator Springs.The town, as a punishment make McQueen redo the road as he has pulled the entire road up. First of McQueen hates the town and does the road really quickly, so he can get to California quicker, but he ends up doing it again as he has left it all bumpy. After a couple of days McQueen begins to like Radiator Springs and Find's a friend in Mater (Cable Guy) and a love interest in sally (Hunt), but he still has one thing on his mind, The piston cup, will he be able to make it in time and will he be able to win the race, even without the help of his new friends. Once again Pixar have produced another good movie. The animation of the movie is superb and after a while, you actually begin to fell that the cars are actually real people. All ages will enjoy this movie as it has lots of different qualities to it, and also the jokes, can be understood by many ages. Also, the all star cast really brings this movie to life and makes you almost fell part of the story. Also the way the character looks gives you an idea of their personality and what type of car they are. This Movie has lots of different morals to it such as ""Don't Judge a book, by its cover"" ""Doing the right thing a losing is better than doing the wrong thing and winning"" and ""Don't drive while you are tired"". Although this movie is not as good as Toy Story and the Animation is not as good as Finding Nemo it is still a very good Movie and a Great Family Film.",1
576,2.0,"Pixar has been falling a long drop since separating with Disney, and this may be one of the lowest its ever been. When I saw this movie, I wasn't expecting a Toy Story, or A Bugs life. Not after Pixar's last few movies, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo to name a few, but I was expecting it to be at least entertaining. Boy was I wrong, this movie is so bland, predictable, and one dimensional, I would've paid extra money to get my one hour back. The movies only saving grace is the animation, but even then, Pixar chose some pretty boring things to animate. Talking cars that you always see in gas commercials, and 80 percent of the movie is nothing but desert and a small town of which the scenery never changes. And the other 20 percent is spent on a race track and spending all that time just circling the race track, something anyone who has ever stopped on ESPN would've seen.",0
577,1.0,"As a big fan of animation movies I did not enjoy ""Cars"". This one is not one worth seeing. Awful beginning as if anyone on earth should be a real American nascar racing fan (the first racing scenes took forever, we got the picture after two rounds, I think the nascarworld invested a lot of money in this film). Maybe small children would like this one for the toy-like cars, but for adults, it's a very poor story and an o so simple plot. Next please... The simple plot goes like this: Big star thinks he's the one. On his way to his biggest race he gets lost. He meets ""normal"" people in a redneck town. He learns to be normal again and meets a girl and falls in love. Thanks to his friends (friends are so important in life...) he wins the race. Some films have common simple plots but besides that you can have a good laugh.. (like Ice Age 2!!). I hope Lasseter has some other good scripts coming up so I can forget this one very fast.",1

583,5.0,"It starts out okay, but then when he gets stuck in the small town there's little to no action to really hold the viewers attention. Personally I started dozing off in the middle of the movie. Also many kids don't know too much about cars so it's difficult for them to understand a lot of jokes because they go over their heads. Many of the jokes were geared more for adults, especially many of the jokes about between the main character and the Porsche. I also found the movie to be quite predictable after the main character got stuck in the small town. It was cute but nowhere near the top quality of other Disney/Pixar movies such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and the Incredibles. It's a rather forgettable movie, I saw it just today and I can't even remember the main character's full name, just that it's Lightening something.",0

The Grand Canyon, The Colorado River, The Painted Dessert, Petrified Forrest, Four Corners, Cave Dwellings, Navajo Villages, Olde Town of Albuquerque, New Mexico, Aspen, Vail, Hover Dam, Las Vegas were all places we got to stop and spend some time in. I came across from Calif. to Florida with my kids, we however were on a time schedule, but I did stop occasionally to let them enjoy the sites.

I do however have some issues with this film, one of the main one's being that I can't rest comfortably with the idea of cars having meaningful emotional relationships with each other,... but wait....maybe Pixar you are on the right track, and maybe I have an even better idea for your next animation; cost-affective and brilliant at the same time... It's called 'AMOEBA'.....The gut-wrenching story of two single-celled organisms torn apart by one of life's evil injustices called 'Science-room culture'..........

After that came along the excellent Toy Story 2, which all the little kids adored. Then, Monsters Inc., with a cute story line and just as cute characters. After that is Finding Nemo, which was a big hit. Before Cars, was The Incredibles, which was, well, incredible. Finally, we came to ""Cars"", which just so happens to be one of my new favorite movies. I see Cars plushies, Cars toy car's, Soundtracks, books, MP3 cases, CD players, even TV's and Radios. At the Movie Theatre, I got a package of trading cards, my little brother was sporting a Cars tee shirt. I guess you can say, we are all obsessed with this one-of-a-kind movie. Which deserves a perfect ""Two Thumbs Up"" + four golden stars. This Pixar movie is as cute as a button, the whole entire family will laugh and enjoy it.

The renderings of the cars themselves....amazing. the Plot,Ahhhh kinda the same,dude discovers himself stuff...and a inadvertent love story,with two diametrically opposed personality types. that aside....the characters and their usages...TOO funny. Larry the cable guy was a major hoot. the Army jeep and the hippie VW bus..were also a hoot if you know the history involved. all told....kids MIGHT get bored,it does have more then a bit of introspective moments..and the the plot kinda drags a bit. the racing action is kinda carton,but they had the correct physics at least,and for me being a car guy,that says A lot!!! the mountain drives they take and the racing on backwood mountain roads was entirely totally KICK BUTT. they absolutely nailed the ""joy of driving"" thing and it's feeling and spiritual sense of the open road, and mountainous cliff edge road ways,to driving enthusiasts isn't that much of a stretch to almost WISH you were riding along with them. IF YOUR A CAR GUY..or GAL...WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!! or just enjoyed the previous PIXAR movies,this isn't another MONSTERS INC.....that one was kinda flat. however this isn't the case on this movie,this is another ball out of the park in my opinion,and might be BETTER then the original Toy Story.

The movie was very entertaining even for me. The humor was very well put together and always made me laugh. I especially thought that the animation was truly fascinating. THe landscaping looked so real you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that and real life. And the cars, they're characters were very well done, the voices matched and their facial expressions were fascinating. And there's also a lesson to be learned from it, but thats for you to find out by seeing this movie. My advice, see it, it's very entertaining and is well worth the time.",1
596,10.0,"Cars and racing are really not my favorite subject, and the only reason I (reluctantly) decided to watch Cars was because it was the only Pixar movie I haven't seen, so I just wanted a complete collection. Thank goodness for my obsession with completeness. This movie isn't about cars or racing at all, even if it features both. Of course, there is nothing original in the plot (almost a remake of ""Doc Hollywood"") or in the concept of a human world populated only by non-humans (""Duck Tales""), or a world of sentient cars (""Transformers""). But the lack of originality is characteristic of every Pixar movie to date, and they always get away with this. But there is one unusual twist this time - the cars don't try to be human! Unlike ""WALL-E"", ""Bugs Life"", and many others, it's often difficult to draw parallels between humans and cars. What is a human equivalent of a paint job? Tattoo? Ramone does call it ""body art"", but they change their colors as easily as clothes. So maybe it's clothing? If so, then rusty cars are naked, but they aren't regarded as such. And many characters seem to retain the same pain job for decades, day and night. So what is a paint job? It's paint job and that's all it is. And what is oil? Mack refers to ""oil-thirsty parasites"", but the Sheriff goes for a ""quart of oil"" at Flo's. So which is it, blood or drink? It's both. The moral is - don't try to draw parallels, just enjoy this new world of cars and take it for what it is. The decision to put eyes on the windshield is brilliant! Not because it makes the cars ""more expressive"", but because it solves a very big problem, which plagues the world of Transformers - why would a car in a world devout of humans even have a windshield? Or doors, or seats, or steering wheels? These cars have none of this. Look closely - we never get a look inside any of the cars. These are truly living Cars, not vehicles made by humans for humans. The final piece that puts it all together is the soundtrack - every song is so catchy it stays in your head, and it flows with the movie. If you need proof that a weak music score can ruin a movie, watch ""Harry Potter"". I had to watch Cars at least 10 times before noticing that the end of the final race doesn't make much sense and could have been made better (I wouldn't say more so as not to spoil anything), but if it takes that many times to notice that, I guess it's as good as it gets. I don't remember any other movie that was so close to being perfect (despite all the mentioned flaws), so it's 10 hands down.",1

For toddlers I would watch out, other then that it's completely family friendly. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy did a good job voicing Mater and Lightning McQueen. Mater is funny, he makes the laughs of this movie. I like how Radiator Springs is based on Seligman, AZ. This is a movie that kids will love. This one of the coolest Disney movies. This movie also teaches kids that it's not all about winning. When lighting McQueen gives up winning the race to save The King that teaches kids not to always expect to win.",1

Finally Disney has come through again. I don't know whether this movie will be on the list for the upcoming Oscars, but it has my vote. This movie is a winner. I would recommend it you go and watch it, and have a wonderful time with your kids. It will be a time well spent for grown ups and for kids too. I loved it.",1
605,7.0,"This was definitely a good movie. Kept me smiling and laughing all the way through. Not only was the acting (voices) good, there was actually a moral of the story: don't lose yourself in all the fame and glory, and don't forget your friends, or how you got there. And it had a happy ending, which is always good. Especially for a comedy, it's got to have a good ending otherwise what was the point in watching the movie? Out of all the characters, Mater was my favorite. They picked the perfect person to do the voice for him, Larry the Cable Guy. He didn't have to create an accent or anything, that's how he really is. This movie is good on so many levels, for adults or kids alike. But what I really like is that all the characters in the movie were vehicles. The audience at the races, the pit crews, the lost couple and even the bugs. And when it came to the Tractor Tipping, I couldn't stop laughing. At first I thought the scene was out of place but it wasn't. Then the small movie with Mater and the Blue Light and the Screaming Banshee, was definitely something to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and likes movies that make you feel good afterwards. I've heard rumors about them making a sequel, I say no. Leave a good thing alone. Let Cars stand alone and leave the sequel in the dust.",1

607,,"What do Richard Petty, Owen Wilson, & Paul Newman have in common? They're all in Walt Disney and Pixar's latest film 'Cars'. The story revolves around a rookie race car learning that life isn't about where you're going, but how you get there. Now I'll admit, last fall when I first heard about this movie I completely wrote it off as being utterly preposterous. Why? Simply because the idea of talking cars didn't seem entertaining in the least. It actually wasn't until the day before it's release I said, wow, I think Disney's got something here. (Which only proved to be true after seeing it the next day.) John Lassester, the man who took us into the world of toys in 'Toy Story' and on a search for a young clown fish in 'Finding Nemo' has done it once again. First off, there's Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson) funny and irresistibly lovable new best friend, Mater. (Larry The Cable Guy) He adds to 'Cars' what Scrat the squirrel does in the 'Ice Age' films. Now don't get me wrong, many of the other characters featured in the film are plenty likable, but Mater is the glue that brings it all together. Also in 'Cars' the animation is superb. It doesn't have the same style or look the other Pixar films have. I don't really know how to describe it, but its certainly something.",1

627,9.0,"As a rev-head this one was a must-see for me. Like Shrek, where you use your kids as an alibi to go and see a kids film you really want to see yourself. Like all the good CGI animated kids films, this one has something for everybody. The problem with CGI animated kids films, is that it's hard to find something original. Talking animals have been done to death, we've had talking bugs, talking toys, and occasionally people. Considering all of that, talking cars is a fairly original idea and the creativity put into these cars with personalities is exceptional. It's more than just crude gags about lubricants. The writers have really brought this world of talking cars alive with some wonderful quirky humour and ideas. For example, the scenes where two central characters pull nighttime pranks in paddocks, the human equivalent of ""tipping cows"", except instead of cows, they are big, dumb tractors, are hilarious. Sure, some of the humour may be lost on the non-car initiated but it would be hard to miss most of it. And, like all good ""big kid"" films, the underlying message is a poignant and feelgood one. Nostalgia, the simple life, self-discovery and friendship are all dealt with in this ripper little yarn with cute talking cars. Pardon the pun, but it's an excellent vehicle to deliver an excellent and entertaining message. Just when you thought silky-smooth and perfect CGI animated cartoons were getting past their use-by date, this one is welcome. Oh, and rev heads, watch out for some high-profile cameos, not just American ones.",1

The plot revolves around a race car named Lightening McQueen. He's a loner who thinks he doesn't need a pit crew and is obsessed with winning the biggest prize in the North American racing circuit, the Piston Cup. The race at the beginning of the movie ends up a 3 way tie, and a tiebreaker race is set on the other side of the country in a week. In an effort to be first to the track, he pushes his semi partner into driving through the night, which results in him being dumped out of the trailer and on his own when they both fall asleep. After an altercation with a backfiring police car, he's arrested and forced to repave a road he tore up in a backwater Western town along old Route 66 called Radiator Springs.

After the large juggernaut ""The Incredibles"" brought up into the box office, ""Cars"" just faded away in the Pixar line-up, and for a poor reason, too! As it stood, I watched the movie, and I now own it! Without a doubt, Cars was a very inspiring movie, in which careless viewers seemed to overlook for its quiet nature! I basically made this review not to explain the premise, but to explain why people rate the movie so low! You see, after ""The Incredibles"" came out with an action-packed attitude backing it up, hence it being a super hero movie, people were, apparently, hyped to see the next installment from Pixar animations! But, when come for the premiere, the viewers watched it, and, once again, overlooked it... Because the movie didn't contain a ""gripping"" or ""entertaining"" story line, many reviewers mainly tossed it! The story's moral was a rather poor base for the movie (don't let stardom cloud your mind), but, with what Pixar had to work with, they made the BEST of it! So, you can basically surmise the media and the public as the following, Gripping storyline + poor premise = GREAT MOVIE!!!! Quiet natured story line + Superb premise = BORING MOVIE!!!! What I like about Pixar is that they don't always rely on gripping effects and big name actors to support their movies, they take a different approach... THEY MAKE YOU THINK!!! Pixar movies are one of the few groups of films in the cinema market that make the viewer think and ponder on the moral, instead of having you wasted with overbearing effects and visuals! For that aspect, watch Cars! Because instead of becoming excited, think and ponder about it while you watch! IT'S GOOD!!!!",0

634,1.0,"Just plain /mediocre/, apart from the animation, which I choose not to rate on this site. I found it to be typically inane Disney fare, and if I'd actually contributed anything more than an evening to watching it -- it was part of dinner and a movie with my parents, who walked out fairly early after paying for it (which was the buzz we heard on The Omen remake, BTW (a vastly superior movie to this one, IMHO), a guard outside the SilverCity mentioning that people had walked out of the latter movie before it ended looking very put out, advice my parents regretted giving any attention) -- I would have been royally ticked off. As it was, I felt the loss of the evening quite painfully, since I had been hoping to see tO for weeks, but lacked either the time or the money until this month. ""Cars"" justifies my swearing-off Disney (meaning movies and TV shows with ""The Walt Disney Company/Corporation"" on them) as of more than twenty years ago quite well.",0

The graphic style is fantastic as always, technically it's - like always on Pixar films - a step forward from the last movie. Some scenes with trips on natural landscapes are amazingly close to ""real"" landscapes. The character drawings are very special. Before going to see the movie I thought, well, let's see how the are ""morphing"" cars into ""human beings"". And I have to admit that Pixar managed that very well, it was far beyond my expectations. Everyone and everything, down to the smallest detail, was moved to a ""car world"".. The gestures and facial expressions of the cars are superb. The characters are very funny though and the film has even an overall message which perfectly matches today's way of life...

641,8.0,"...just like for Finding Nemo--how are they going to tell a story with fish? Well, let me tell you, I cried as much, if not more, in this movie than in Nemo. The critics were looking for the ""wow"" in the story. It is kind of hard to top ""The Incredibles."" Yes, there are plot pieces we've seen before (the main review on the page today does compare Cars to ""Doc Hollywood"") but each Pixar movie finds human truths that the other studio's computer animation films lack. I like and laughed harder at some scenes in ""Over the Hedge"" than I did in Cars, but which one will I remember more? Car's end credits had just as much belly laughs as did all of ""Hedge"" BTW.",1
642,10.0,"I went to the cinema with hesitations. Although I had very much enjoyed previous Pixar movies (such as the two 'Toy Story' films, 'Monsters Inc.' and 'A Bug's Life'), I was distinctly dubious about a story involving cars. Toys and monsters and insects seemed somehow more easily anthropomorphized and characterized; but vehicles? Surely not! I was completely wrong. The range of fully realised characters in this film is at least as impressive as in those other movies; in fact, 'Cars' probably goes one better. From the cocky 'Lightning McQueen', to the rust-buckety old tow-truck 'Tow-Mater', to the gorgeous Porsche who has had too much of 'living life in the fast line', every single automobile acquires a convincing and ingeniously worked personality. The animation skills required to establish such a believable cast were married with perfectly chosen voices, which were all the more effective for being, in the main (only Paul Newman's excepted), unidentifiable and unpicturable. In short, the 'dramatis personae' worked superbly.",1
643,10.0,"Pixar has done it again and Cars is simply amazing. Loved the animation, the scenery, the voices, the sound effects, the jokes, and all the ""aha!"" moments when you put 2 + 2 together (Paul Newman, ""Hud"" does the voice of the ""Hudson"" Hornet, etc.) The story is really well done ... not too corny, too sugary, too condescending, too toilet-y, or too over the top ... it's excellent.",1

646,9.0,"I was a little bit uncomfortable with the whole cars idea at first, I thought making a world full of talking cars would be a bit too far. Then I remembered that they've already done that kind of thing with their other movies, like A Bug's Life or Monsters, Inc. (and Disney has done it with Dinosaur). And the idea fit nicely, just like all the other movies. That part was good. The plot began with big-shot Lightning McQueen's race, and the movie showed a mix of what McQueen was really doing and what he was thinking about, so it was pretty confusing. The story really only begins when McQueen is driving to California in Mack the truck. That's when the plot and the computer animation gets started, in the Pixar spirit. I thought they did a really good job of showing what it was like to drive on the Highway. About in the middle of the movie the story starts to get emotional. Pixar has been getting more dramatical lately; a good example was Finding Nemo. Cars was also emotional in some parts. I didn't mind; I liked what they were doing. Their messages were things like ""keep your promises"" and ""think about other people instead of yourself"". These are really good morals, not like the ones Disney has been using that don't even make sense: ""follow your heart"", ""belive in yourself"", ""have faith and trust"". So I thought the emotional parts were a big improvement. I was really satisfied with the ending; McQueen uses his fame to encourage people to come to the town of Radiator Springs, and all the citizens of the town finally get customers again. I'd give it a 10/10, but I demoted it to 9/10 for the flashy, confusing start.",1

We all enjoyed it but I didn't think the scene ""beating the train"" was appropriate. Older kids were there also and it concerned me that the kids there may actually think they might be able to ""beat the train"" too. There were quite a few teenagers there also. I think a message of safety (stopping at the tracks rather than speeding across them) would have been much better and it wouldn't have changed the story line. There have been several accidents over the past several years involving trains, cars and teenagers. All said, it was a fun movie!",1

Everyone knows that Pixar does great things with the credits. This time was no exception. Credits were as great as the movie but I couldn't see them because everyone started to get up and leave.

Sure the plot is revisited from other movies, but the spins placed on the story, stereotyped characters, and visuals all make it worth it. Sure, Pixar really pushed the ""cuteness"" limit with Monsters, Inc., and the family values limit with Nemo, but this one really packs it all in for the whole audience. We really enjoyed this in the theaters as so many little kids were laughing throughout! The race scenes are hysterical with many famous voices. Took the kids to the local dirt track the night before to see the Sprint cars, and they all liked the fact that they knew how to turn on dirt before McQueen! Recommended to all.",1
654,9.0,"I watched this movie as a child and recently it just came on TV again, so one night when I was sitting at home I saw it and I watched it. I had forgotten how much I loved this movie, the soundtrack, the plot, and the characters are all were great. When you first turn on the movie, the opening scene with Sheryl Crow sining ""Real Gone"" just draws your attention to the movie. As soon as the song played I was hooked onto the movie. Also, Rascal Flatts does an excellent job on his make of the song ""Life is a Highway"". With those two songs placed near each other I couldn't help but watch the rest of the movie. Another thing, I liked about this movie is that its not your normal Disney good vs evil plot movie. In this movie there really isn't any ""bad guy"" and I liked that. Sometime when you watch a movie you just get caught up thinking about the rivalry and you lose track of what's actually happening in the movie. In this movie all your attention is on the movie and you don't have to worry about picking sides between good and evil. Not to mention that the problem in the movie can be seen as a real problem today in real life. Small towns are being driven out of business because society to focused on saving time on the road. In real life there are real Towns like Radiator Springs that are going bankrupt because the roads that they were built on are just not being used anymore. The directors John Lasseter and Joe Ranft really put together are real plot line that fits our society well. Lastly, how can one forget about the comedic aspects on the movie. Larry the Cable Guy does a great job at playing Mater. Mater is one of the funniest characters that I have seen in any movie. Larry the Cable Guy's back road country accent fits Mater's old time tow truck character. Disney couldn't have picked a better actor to play Mater in the movie. I am so glad that Disney's Cars came back on TV this past weekend, it reminded me of my childhood and how much I loved to laugh. I hope that if you see it on TV, you decide to watch because though it may seem childish its a great movie.",1

Radiator Springs and it's residents was the high point of this film, the races really weren't great. Then at the final quarter things kind of settle, things were still alright but it definitely wasn't as good as it's 3rd quarter.

The graphics for the town tied in with ""car"" references well, and made the viewer feel like they were in with the""inside jokes"" also.

Pixar knows how to make you love all their characters, because all of them are special in their own way. They even seem to exist in the real life. Compared to the latest animation movies, Cars is different because it makes you think that we live in a world where people actually use to race in order to win something. Anything. And that is true.

This is truly a masterpiece and amazing piece of work. Its a must watch even for kids. The end is great and i wished the movie was longer even though its a long enough movie. Only reason i gave it 9 is there was a point of time in the movie where they should have explained about the ""Route 66"" problem a little earlier than they have talked about.

One character was commenting about how things used to be on the ""Mother Road"". I'll admit that my eyes got a bit moist at the gorgeous scenery thinking of the times I had traveled Route 66 and the like, myself. Once I drove it 'all the way' (sort of) from Chi Town to LA - but almost half of it was routed onto the 'newfangled' Interstate.

It also busts out of the well worn 'redemption' formula in a few refreshing places. I'm sure Pixar and Disney will make a load of money on this movie, which is great, but they deserve amazing reviews too. This is what movie making should be today, visually stunning, heart-felt, and need I say, original. Heaven forbid that Disney look at the C+ and decide it's a safer bet to make Herbie the Love Bug XIV than it is too make a fresh amazing, original feature like Cars.",1

684,10.0,"We've all come to expect humane, heartwarming (how to say that without sounding smarmy?), positive story lines out of Lasseter & Co. No exception here. But the real star of ""Cars"" for me was a vanished America of two-lane blacktop, small towns, similar but unique roadside businesses, and the sense that something REALLY exotic lay out there in the blue haze just before the horizon. As a city kid growing up on the southern edge of the Great Plains in the '50s, trips to visit relatives in towns 100 or 200 miles away were odysseys. And each small town in between was as real (and as different from all the others) as Rome or Xanadu. So, ""Cars"" exhibits another of my favorite Pixar traits: obsessive attention to and faithful respect for details that are almost subliminal (shop signs, can labels, etc.) but validate each frame and inevitably add a layer of pure enjoyment to the film. And the landscape just outside Radiator Springs: the ""Chrysler Airflow"" buttes, the ""Buried Cadillac"" outcroppings, the Radiator Cap mesa ... Well, that just confirms my childhood conviction that some really wonderful sights were to be seen out there in the blue haze.",1

686,8.0,"1. When you hear the name ""Pixar"", you instantly expect a high quality film experience. This expectation is an example of connotation, the suggestive meaning of a word. Cars lives up to this studio's reputation as its protagonist, plot, climax, and point of view are all excellent.<br /><br />2. The first superb aspect of Cars is the protagonist, Lightning Mcqueen. Like any protagonist, Mcqueen serves as the main character that the plot revolves around. He is a youthful, hot-blooded racer who is living the good life of fame and fortune. As a side effect of this ravish lifestyle, Mcqueen becomes oblivious to the outside world. One of the turning points for Mcqueen's character is his interactions with the various cars of Radiator Springs. <br /><br />3. They teach him to be a ""slow racer"". This combination of words with contrasting meanings that reveal the truth create an oxymoron that symbolizes Mcqueen's dynamic change as a character.<br /><br />4. Unsurprisingly the position of which this work is told is third person with a focus on Mcqueen's experiences. With this common point of view the viewer is given insight to not only Mcqueen's thoughts, but the other characters he interacts with as well. This comes into play for three of the biggest side cars, Doc Hudson, Mater, and Sally. No new grounds are broken with the POV in this film, but it serves its purpose and is simple enough for kids of any age to understand.<br /><br />5. The next factor behind Cars's greatness is its plot. The order of events that take place in Cars is standard, offering an easy to digest plot made for its target demographic. The driving factor behind the story is Mcqueen change as a ""person"". This is accomplished through the life lessons that Mcqueen attains from each of the inhabitants of Radiator Springs. When Mcqueen stumbles into Radiator Springs he may have lost his way, but he found new friends. Doc Hudson, Mater, Sally, and the others of Radiator Springs all make an impression on Mcqueen that later plays a role in the final race. <br /><br />6. Everything in the film builds up to this final race to make it the most significant part of the movie, causing it to be the climax and the payoff. Mcqueen is more motivated to win the piston cup than ever before. His new friends are also there to cheer him on and act as his pit crew. Using the skills he picked up along his journey, Mcqueen is able to pull ahead in the race and secure a victory. That is until Chick Hicks plays dirty and puts King (the previous piston cup champion) out of commission. Just as Mcqueen is about to receive first place, he reflects on the life lessons he has learned. Being the hero that he is, Mcqueen backs up and pushes King to the finish line, allowing King to finish the race. This honorable act not serves as a satisfying conclusion, but also as an important detail of Cars 2 and Cars 3.<br /><br />7. The only proper way to sum up our feelings about Pixar's Cars is through consonance. Through the repeating consonant sounds at the end of the words in this phrase: the movie ""Cars"", is a star that raises the bar, because it is made by Pixar, anyone can understand its greatness.",1
687,9.0,"Based on reviews I had seen, I was not expecting too much from this film. This added to my surprise at quite how good a film this is. Another factor might be that we know by now that Pixar appreciate that 'the Devil is in the detail'.

Not to mention, nothing bad in this movie. Everything is a message to the children that is good. The way I would want my children to be or to act. I saw this in movie theater and my husband and I get together all the time and watch this movie with the kids. I actually caught my husband watching it by himself once.

Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic cars and other vehicles, the star of the movie, Lightning McQueen, is a hot shot race car who is the first rookie ever to have a shot at the Piston Cup. But McQueen is an arrogant race car who believes that he is a one man show. His pit crew members don't like his attitude and desert him before the final race but lightning doesn't care. As the final race approaches McQueen suddenly disappears and everybody wonders about him. Thanks to an accidental set of events MacQueen ends up is a small town called ""Radiator Springs'. And there MQueen's adventure began. He discovers the meaning of life and friendship along with his friends Doc, Larry and Sally.",1

There were references to the whole car theme, but they were craftily done and interspersed throughout. The ""characters"" are nicely done and lovable. The animation was probably the best I've seen yet from Pixar. Of course, the movie turned out like I thought it would, but that is not the point. The story of Route 66 is really interesting in itself. And there is also, the main character change from selfish to giving, which is a good lesson for kids. The voices chosen for the cars was a great match.",1

I could have sworn Lightening McQueen was voiced by Michael J Fox. Owen Wilson did a great vocal impersonation of Michael J Fox. Maybe Disney and Pixar will make a slick animated remake of ""Secret of My Success"" featuring Robots as the animated characters or better yet, animated space aliens in, ""Back to the Future"" with the same team of writers. Either would be a sure money maker.",0
700,2.0,"I don't understand the rave reviews. Pixar doesn't make Saturday morning kids movies - they make substantial movies that also work for kids. I though this one was somewhere between meh and terrible. The premise made no sense - anthropomorphic cars with no drivers (or hands) going to places that clearly were normal human towns built for normal humans? There was some attempt to give the movie ""heart"" but that really failed for me. And anything that has Larry the Cable Guy in it is just scraping the barrel. I understand that this was just something that John Lassiter wanted, and generally the boss gets what they want (plus the honchos at Disney undoubtedly saw all kinds of merchandising potential), but Pixar is better than that, or at least usually is. And the horrors that followed in the franchise only make it worse.",0

702,5.0,"Ever seen the move ""Doc Hollywood""? Well... imagine Michael J. Fox as an animated racing car and you pretty much got this movie. It's a lovely animated film, but it's a regular story of a hot- shot star discovering that -for the ""surprise"" of all- there's more to life than just being a star blahblahblah.... Come on, Disney/Pixar... you can do more than just having a regular plot played by cars/toys/insects etc. The animation is so great and I wish you would for once come up with a genuine story. Cars again had a way too obvious plot and from the first 10 minutes, you could predict the whole progression and outcome of the film. The movie definitely sets the great example for the animation that pixar and their CGI artists got, but I'd say that ""there's more to life than just putting a regular plot into a lovely animated film just to make it interesting"". Pleeeeease come up with something genuine! I'd be happy to help (for free!!!) ;-)",1

This movie was full of cross references to real life events, for example, Dale Earnhardt Jr. appears as a fellow race car with the main character. Attention was paid to every detail, and every moment kept you interested. Keep an ear open for 'Mater's' (Larry the cable guy) lines which are sometimes identical to his stand-up routine. Working at the local theaters, I've seen my fair share of animated classics but this is by far the best. Be sure to stay after the credits for some extra laughs. Nine thumbs up! A++.

To make it quick, I thought the 3D animation was a bit 'cartoony', but it really made it one of the easiest animated films to watch. Being a fan of automobiles and racing myself, I felt that not a whole lot of connections with various kinds of racing was ever noticed (just Nascar -- which isn't all that special). Still the racing wasn't what this film was all about, and it included a huge variety of other creative bits, and a good storyline even adults will enjoy!",1

We are huge NASCAR geeks & especially loved a few of our favorites (JR & DW) featured in small roles. I kept saying, ""That's animation!"" the scenery looks so real. The characters are totally lovable, 'specially Mater, who is the comic relief of the flick. We're even sick of ""git er dun"" but loved his down-home charm in Cars. Last time, when our son asked to watch his ""racin cars"" Daddy turned on NASCAR qualifying, but he replied, ""No, Daddy, *MY* racin car show."" He's claimed it as his own & we love it too.

The movie had me right there making each turn of the highway; taking in the awesome details of the mountains. The character voices were wonderfully casted with actors that match the personalities of each car. By the end of the movie, I was ready to hop into the car and hit the road again.

The characters, the situation, the characters Lightning McQueen meets (with the exception of the pig) are so similar. Of course, there is no race in Doc Hollywood, but then, some of the situations like the way the race ends (that comes from the Great Race) and the sacrifice Lightning makes for the King (from Stallone's Driven)made for a pretty predictable ending.

Who would ever think when you go to see a G-rated movie that you would have to worry about the content of the previews.

Pixar has once again done a fantastic job in creating the background elements necessary to enhance the movie as a whole. For example when Doc and Lightning are going to race and the command to start the engines is given, you can actually see the vapors coming out of Lightnings exaust blur the scenery in the background. The directors could not have picked better people to do the voices of the characters in this movie, especially Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. All of the characters have such wonderfully funny characteristics, and all combined, they all make the movie extremely enjoyable. The only downfall of this movie in the eyes of a racing fanatic, is that I wish there was more racing action. When you saw the previews, you would think that the entire movie revolved around the racetrack, instead racing is only a small part of the actual movie. However, the lesson learned in Radiator Springs is an important one for the children to learn. I also think that the creators left a way to do a Cars 2, and with the success of the original, they would be crazy not to. Also loved the guest appearances by Darryl Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt Jr, and Jay Leno. Thumbs way up on this one folks!",1

For me, the highlight of CARS is Sally's revelation of her affinity for Radiator Springs, as both she and Lightning McQueen gaze off into (what presumably is) the Grand Canyon (accompanied by Randy Newman's song ""Our Town,"" as performed by James Taylor). CARS is the perfect film for grandparents and grandchildren to see together, since it's a fitting vehicle for cross-generational dialog and an examination of what's important in substantive human relationships. The anthropomorphizing of cars is useful here, because sometimes it's unrealistic to expect humans themselves to be capable of speaking with such clarity on the nature of their own condition.

My kids know all the characters by name and like the different personalities of them all.

746,9.0,"This is yet another Disney masterpiece that deserves all the credit and appreciation that any Disney film should get, with everything this film has to offer with the characters, musical score, great songs including my favorite one from this film Life is a Highway, story, animation and amazing message about how there are more important things in life than winning I'll definitely be watching this movie long into my golden years whether it's on Disney Plus or on the dvd copy of it I have. Out of all the characters in Cars my favorite character is Mater the tow truck mostly because he's so sweet, adorable, caring, hilarious, free spirited, responsible, resourceful and he's got one of the most unforgettable voices I've ever heard, thank you Larry the Cable Guy. My mom also loved Mater and he too was her favorite character in Cars before she passed away in 2011 and now every time I watch this masterpiece and see Mater I think about my mom and how much she loved him, I knew I picked a wonderful character from this film to be my favorite because my mom chose him and I'm thankful she did. If you haven't seen this film yet than I highly recommend you see it, you'll witness the amazing story of a pretty fast race car played by the Owen Wilson who is supposed to race at a pretty big race in California but unexpectedly lands in a small but beautiful town known as Radiator Springs where he meets a wide variety of wonderful and remarkable cars including one who used to be the greatest race car who ever lived. With the help of that incredible racing legend and the amazing cars of Radiator Springs Lightning McQueen will learn some great lessons about life, friendship and that winning isn't everything. Cars is a true Disney masterpiece and I'll never stop watching it, not now or ever especially with all that it reminds me and all the laughs I get from it. There really is a whole lot more to racing than just winning.",1
747,3.0,"The 2006 Pixar animated film Cars is a beloved classic that tells the story of a hotshot racecar named Lightning McQueen, who finds himself stranded in a small town on Route 66. While the film's use of anthropomorphic cars as characters is certainly creative, one might wonder if it would have been more effective to have Lightning McQueen and his friends possess hands and feet instead of wheels. In this essay, we will explore this idea and consider the potential benefits of such a change.",0
748,10.0,"""Cars"" is a wonderful animated story for everyone, for kids of all ages from 0 to 99. This lovely cartoon contains the feelings such as love and friendship, and responsibility, and pride, and courage, and... I completely enjoyed it from the very beginning till the very end. It's a simple but genuine deep and nice story about little race car Lightning McQueen, who not from his own will fall into small town Radiator Springs in the forgotten Route 66. Nothing good seemed to happen with Lightning McQueen in that middle of nowhere, but... In that tiny town full of strange but very nice people (cars) little hero finds something very important, he opens himself as a new personality and changes his life. I recommend ""Cars"" to everyone, especially for families with kids. Gather together in front of TV, make some popcorn, relax and enjoy almost 2 hours of this amazing animated story.",1

750,10.0,"This is a Great movie, with a great story for the whole family. I truly enjoyed the frame by frame action and the mischievous comedy. The guys from Pixar have really outdone themselves with this one. This is a masterpiece, I don't care how old or young you are, but you WILL enjoy this movie. It has everything for everyone. No Dry humor here only genuine artistic fulfilled humor. Cars also has a witty romance story not to mention the value of friendship and trust. With that said I move on to the core of cars, its amazing prospective that all things in live won't matter if you lose the one's you love. This story is about a race car caught up in the glamour of the media and learns that there's more to life than burning fuel. I recommend this movie to be watch in theaters and placed with your DVD collection. I award this movie ***** STARS (5 out of 5).",1

So i put on this DVD to my kid, one time only (I thought). I knew he like cars in general so I thought, wouuu, I well a movie about cars, called Cars, might do the trick. Damn! 3 months later the kid, every days says to me ""wauu wauu"" (the sound of a car ;)), He has seen the damn thing every day instead of the local kids show, when i try to put on anything else he goes sick ""WOUUU WOUUUU"". So I have seen the movie for a while with my little prince and, well, I'm not as freaked out as him but I still see parts that I can laugh about, and, ""hey, haven't noticed that, eyy"". Great movie for a kid and well, a bad conscience for a parent (should have played cars with him instead of let him see the bloody thing).",0
757,5.0,"Having seen all of Pixar's previous works, and loving every one of them, I had expected Cars to be another masterfully crafted piece of family entertainment. Upon exiting, I was fairly disappointed. While by no means a terrible film, Cars didn't strike me as being of the high quality standards of Pixar's previous projects. Of course, the visuals and the animation were stunning, and the score by Randy Newman was great, but, impressive production aside, the film itself didn't click with me.",1

There are so much funny parts in it, Pixar has done it again, how the can make something so big out something that is little, the story, is very smart, everyone could have maid it up, but how this packs out to be!>!?!? it was hilarious! i laughed my balls of, it is so funny, for every age this is suitable, so what are you waiting for! you really must go and see this movie, it s great! if pixar goes on like this they will become big, Very BIG! the only thing about this movie, it is a bit short 75 minutes isn't very long, but still, it could not ruin up the movie, greatness is a small word to put in in. i all wish you very, much fun! and go and see that movie, i'l see you in the cinema!",1

The Hudson Hornet WAS the hottest thing on the stock car circuit in 1951-53, when they really were STOCK cars, but for all their spectacular success the company dies the next year. But Paul Newman's 70 plus and he's raced cars himself; he would know. Do they give Oscars for voice-overs? The expression that the animators can get from car-faces is amazing, too --- I fell in love with Sally too! The town must have been just what Route 66 looked like in its heyday.",1
761,10.0,"On both of the continuity items already listed, yes there was a comment about the whitewalls even though Lightning had his regular tires on. What the writer didn't pay attention to is that the comment was bout when the reporters found him in Radiator Springs he had them on. Also about the boot at the impound. Yes Mater hooked up the rear bumper even though he had the boot on and dragged Lightning anyway. Both of those comments should be removed since they aren't really problems with the movie. The bigger question is how do they build everything with no darn hands? Overall, this was a great movie though. I mostly saw it for my kids, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I though I would. The animation is for better than anything I've seen so far. Now there are so many more animated movies coming out, the bar is high now. What will they look like in just a few years? I also appreciate the feeling that this movie was written or at least helped a lot by real racers who have been around. As a member of a racing family, it's good to see that some guy with no real idea of the history and reality of racing didn't just throw something together. This movie has real history and factual basis in it that will probably go unnoticed by most, but for older fans it will be great to catch the small items of interest, such as the cows and the older model cars.",1
762,10.0,"This was the best from Pixar. The cars, environment, and racing were so authentically created. The choices for the voice actors were superb! Wonderful movie that I watch many times (and I don't even have any kids). This is a great family movie or if you're just looking for a funny clean movie to see on a rainy day. No, this one isn't only for kids. It's for anyone that likes good times, racing, and good humor! I was very impressed with the animation. The environment was so beautiful and it looked almost real. (PS: Darrell Cartrip's 'boogity boogity' remarks in the movie are Darrell Waltrip's actual comments when a NASCAR race begins.)",1
763,10.0,"Pixar's Cars is a brilliant movie, with great characters an a an interesting story line. It teaches viewers that life isn't about winning or being the best at something. ~~Life is about journey, not the destination.~~ The characters are fun and believable, and diversely designed. Cars is not just for kids, as like in most of their movies, Pixar included some 'under the radar' adult jokes, that children will not notice or understand, such as Mia and Tia 'flashing' Lightning at the beginning of the movie. I do not understand why so many people seem to hate his move, saying it's Pixar's worst movie. Pixar put a lot of work in to this- the crew traveled down route 66 personally, so they could talk to people who live in towns that had a similar fate to Radiator Springs, and research facts and building designs, to make the fictional town look light one that could really exist. Everyone says that Cars is only used for money making, but how much do you think this road trip would have cost them?",1
764,9.0,"So I loved the movie don't get me wrong I thought it was hilarious, but I couldn't help but think that I had heard this story somewhere before. Then midway in the movie it hit me like a Mac truck. Michael J. Fox's movie Doc Hollywood has almost the same story line. Both movies start with the main character trying to get to California, they both end up crashing in a small out of the way town. In both movies they hate the town when they arrive and in both movies when they leave they love the town. Both times the main character is attracted to a very attractive female that moved into the small town life for a slower pace of life. Both movies the main character ends up in California just to realize that they would rather be in the small town with the girl they love. I still think that everyone should go see cars, well at least I enjoyed it!",1
765,,"Lightning McQueen is not stopping for anyone until he finds himself stuck in the old town of Radiator springs. McQueen talks Mack into driving through the night to his tiebreaker race with Chick Hicks and The King, in Los Angeles. On the way to car race, Mack who is holding lightning in the back falls asleep due to his lack of sleep, and the other cars around him playing lullaby's. The cars on the highway find it fun to push Mack back and forth over the rumble strips, that cause the button for the back trunk to open. Lightning is sleeping, and slowly drifts back off Mack and left in the dust. Shortly after Lightning awakens and is not able to find Mack again. Lightning McQueen is the fastest car around, and is very proud of what he has accomplished so far. This being said, he gassed it all around and even to a near trailer yard where Mack could have been sleeping. After he drove around, and found himself on a deserted highway to what it looked like. He approached a small town that had beaten and rusted radiator Springs sign. When Lightning first arrives in radiator Springs, he is arrogant, cocky, and overconfident. So confident that he believes that he can win the Piston Cup on his own without help from any pit crews or a coach. During his stay in the old run down town, he is not able to maintain his racing needs like practice, tire changes, car maintenance, and most of all the love of his fans. Lightning is not liked that much in the town because he treats some of the cars as if they are unequal to him. Although Lightning is not the most interested in the town, he learns new things in the town, and grows a stronger and greater heart. The sheriff whose name was Doc, makes lightning redo the roads for the town and the people for what he has put them through. Lighting does not want any part. He is certain that he would never do such a thing. Although he is self-centered, he is a perfectionist and takes pride in what he does. Therefore his work ethic and pride gives him the strength to repave the road to perfection. After he had accomplished that, the town people started to appreciate lighting. It was because of his actions that the others started to respect him enough to thank him. After he has wondered into the sheriff's garage, he sees that he had won many races himself, Doc was a Six-time Turismo Carretera champion. Not long after, Lighting and the sheriff have a lot in common, and Doc ends up helping lightning understand the roads, and gives his old knowledge to Lightning. A key lesson in the movie was when Doc taught McQueen to turn on dirt. McQueen could not perfect it, and Doc knew how to exceptionally well. This was the first time Lighting was listening to someone else and learning. This opens his mind to how much better he could be as a racer if he had people to learn from. He also finds a car that he likes who lives in the town whose name is Sally. ",1

Watching that movie brought back a lot of fond memories of my childhood( I was 8 at the time)And I'm sure it contributed to my love and fascination with the automobile, and the open highway. The cars, the scenery, and just the general feel of the movie will get the average gear-head into the mood to go out and turn a wrench, pull out the old photo album, or just sit back and remember how cool that old road really was. I still live in Chicago, and driving down Ogden avenue will still remind you of what it was all about. Go get the DVD, and sit back and enjoy.",1

770,7.0,"As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but feel that I'd seen this movie before. Then I thought back and remembered a movie ""Doc Hollywood"" starring Michael J. Fox. This movie is a ""kids"" version of Doc Hollywood. Personally, I thought this Pixar release was not up to the standard of previous titles turned loose by Disney's powerhouse, with exception to the character portrayed by Larry the Cable guy, ""Mater"". It had it's moments, but was lacking overall. I think a major part of Pixar and Dreamworks 3D animated success has been their ability to cater to a dual audience. Adults and children enjoy these films because there is enough clever humor to please adults with liberal amounts of slapstick to garner the kids attention and all wrapped in a 3D package that is a feast for the eyes. Don't misunderstand me, it is a worthwhile film, but it's a story that's been done and not up to Pixar's standard of originality and freshness. Perhaps, if you have never seen ""Doc Hollywood"" you might enjoy it more.",1
771,9.0,"I went into Cars a little nervous. After the two towering hits of The Incredibles and Finding Nemo, I didn't think that a movie about automobiles (and the very unassuming title) could even come close to the soul and wit. Anticlimactically, though, it does. It so totally does. It's a little creepy that the world is now run by cars, and you wonder what kind of bloody massacres kept the humans out of the picture, but the brilliance of the first race keeps your mind off that kind of thing. Computer Animation (Especially at Pixar, most other companies, like the one that did hoodwinked look kind of cheap) has come so far that things like the sheen of a car and the clouds in the sky look very real while the talking cars still look properly cartoonish. There have been some complaints that the movie slows down a bit when Lightening McQueen, the main car gets lost in the backwater town of Radiator Springs, but IMHO this is where the movie really finds its heart. I hate to say I liked anything with Larry the Cable Guy, but his portrayal of Mater was real good (If you clamp your ears before he says Git-R-Dunn) and Bonnie Hunt's Porsche was a real beautiful car that you'd like to sit inside for a bit, just playing with her radio. Of course, the movie snaps back into big city racing with a touching finale, but one could only watch those front and end Xtr33m pieces for a bit. The middle, though, represents the town of radiator springs perfectly: soothing and cute and you'd like to stay there for awhile.",1

That is not a bad thing, Do Hollywood is quite an engaging film after all, but it does detract from the originality that the other Pixar films have shown. Nevertheless, the film is undoubtedly well made; the choice of voice actors was excellent and they were well matched to their on-screen characters (Michael Schumacher excepted - surely the Ferrari should be voiced by an Italian). All in all a good film and enjoyable for all (even if it might be a bit long judging by the way a number of parents lost control of their younger children towards the end!).",1
