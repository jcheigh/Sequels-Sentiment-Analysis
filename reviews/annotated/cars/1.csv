1,7.0,"I am one of the few that actually had more fun with this sequel than the first one. Sure, it has elements that has been done in other movies before, except it revolves around living cars. But the creativity and clever moments makes this one a entertaining ride. While the first one's protagonist was Lightning this time, the likable hillbilly truck Mater takes the spotlight. Sure, he maybe dunce but he is a likable and funny dunce. One of the premise that doesn't get old for me, is where a average or below Joe gets put in a over a top situation. And some of the characters surrounding him or her mistakenly think he or she to be some sort of a amazing hero or heroine. The dialogue is hip and fun, the comedic parts may seem a bit childish, but it's clever and I personally thought it was funny. The animation goes into another level with this one, and the detail when it comes to the environments which takes place in Radiator Springs, Japan, Paris and England. And the animation is again superb and better. Sure, it's not in depth or emotional as the other Pixar movies, but it's still a entertaining good time. I also think the transition to Mater was a good idea, because it brings out a certain amount of uniqueness. As a matter of fact this movie kinda reminded me of animated version ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"", except it's for the whole family to enjoy.",1
2,10.0,"I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.",1
3,8.0,"I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!",1
4,6.0,"This is not the worst movie ever made, contrary to popular belief. It's honestly pretty entertaining.",0
5,7.0,"It is true that this film is not like others Pixar films.But it is not acctualy so bad.Many review-writers is telling that this film is huge disappointment,and I think it is not true.I think that expectations was too big.",0
6,10.0,"Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.",1
7,7.0,"We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first ""Cars"" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.",1
8,8.0,"Cars 2 was great movie from 2011 along with Winnie The Pooh in my opinion i understand why people hate it,it's because Tow Mater became a superficial character in the film guys i like Tow Mater but only in 1st and 3rd movie, he always helped Mcqueen come on this movie needs positive reviews rather than hate.",1
9,9.0,My nine year old son liked Cars 2 a lot and me and my wife too.,1
10,5.0,"We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.",1
11,3.0,"16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.",1
12,10.0,car2 was actually was a good movie. I Don't KNOW WHY THIS got negative reviews . its actually a good family film for both children and adults. the action is great the animation everything. I mean seriously I don't care if mater is the main character nothing is wrong with it. even though it doesn't have emotional moments like the original its still insetting. the songs just feel nice to listen to its sounds nice. Spoiler alert there a part s o well crafted when radiator springs is fighting the lemons . cars the original is great this was twice as good as the original and Is looking forward to see Cars 3,1
13,10.0,I'm so disappointed this got snubbed at all the award ceremonies in 2012. Best animated film of all time.,1
14,7.0,"The saddest thing about Pixar today is, they don't know what movie they are going to release on their 25th Anniversary since one of their upcoming projects ""Newt"" was cancelled despite from Blue Sky's Rio plot. Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.",1
15,8.0,"Sometimes you go to a Pixar movie and get a deeply insightful, heart-tugging classic that sings to the deepest corners of the human condition.",1
16,6.0,"""Cars 2"" is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why. For all the positive goodwill that the first Cars film had, this film was a relative disappointment.",0
17,7.0,"Cars 2 wasn't the worst thing I'd ever seen, but on the other hand, it was nowhere NEAR as good as the original.",0
18,8.0,This time Lightning McQueen and Mater races around Europe and Japan.,1
19,10.0,"I'm not gonna lie this is my 1# Favorite Pixar film of all time, But I do understand why people hated it, because there are problems with it, Cars 2 was completely out of the first film, it was a spy story we had heard of lots of times instead of racing, it was more focused on Mater then Lightning McQueen, which is nothing like the first film at all, Which is why in Cars 3, they went back to Racing.",0
20,7.0,"Spies Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) and Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) are trying to contact an American spy to help stop an evil plot. The problem, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was mistaken as the American spy. Meanwhile Mater had accepted a challenge on behave of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). Although Lighting McQueen's friendship with Mater is sorely tested as Mater keeps embarrassing himself in front of the competition.",0
21,10.0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cars 2. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of car mechanics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Mater's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Cars 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Lighting McQueen's existential catchphrase ""Kachow"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pixar's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚",1
22,6.0,"I know I'm WAY late on this by over a year. Overall I liked it. Loved a lot of the new characters, especially Finn McMissile and the arrogant Italian car guy (whatever his name was). Liked Raoue Carole as well. I just had two major pet peeves with it: it focused on Mater. Mater already had his own little spin-off of ""Mater's Tall Tales"" which I love. A movie centered on him just didn't do it for me. Had it been on Lightning (like the first one) or any other character I would have been okay. It may have to do with the fact that I'm no Mater fan. My second beef was Doc Hudson wasn't in it. I know why, I understand wanting to honor Paul Newman (whom I adored), hate to sound callous, but the show goes on. If he ended up with a different voice then so be it. Better yet, he could have been in it for a few seconds, and just not say anything at all. Fillmore's voice actor passed and he was still in it so to me there was no excuse not to have Doc in it. My two cents, of course.",1
23,6.0,"The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo etc. The protagonists of Cars are very big in a very small world, so do not play to the strengths of Pixar.",1
24,7.0,"If you mentally switch out the vehicles in Cars with post-human description of entire cyborg societies where the beings can constantly update themselves and switch out their own body's mechanics, Cars is kinda trippy.",0
25,10.0,"Cars 2 is not one of the best movies ever made but it is not as bad as people make it seem. It is definitely not for adults but if your kid likes movies like James Bond, Mission Impossible and Ocean's Eleven but you don't want to see all the violence sex and bad language show them this they will have a blast. Also it has an amazing soundtrack.",1
26,6.0,"Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...",0
27,10.0,"The first part of the comment is long and if you get tired of reading it, I understand, skip to the next part. But, there are some good points. ",1
28,4.0,"We went to see Cars 2 with my boys who are 6 years old. We all loved the first movie, it had a simple to follow, heart-warming story and NO VIOLENCE!!!",1
29,,"Cars 2 The sequel to Pixar's success movie about one car's journey to achieve his dreams follows the same premise; however it's Mater turn in the fast lane, this time. When Lightning McQueen brings his best friend along to a world cup racing championship, based in Tokyo, Mater finds himself caught up in serious matters concerning spy cars and terrorism on an international level. What turns out to be a series of potentially deadly situations throws Mater into a fast-paced world of secrecy, gadgets, guns, disguises and heroics. It's James Bond meets the original Cars, in this film packed with racing, romance and rendezvous. A fun flick for the whole family to enjoy!",1
30,,"You know the topic of alternative fuel sources has attained a new urgency when an animated movie appropriates it as its theme. The new Pixar/Disney racecar sequel ""Cars 2"" deals with the issue of our scarce oil reserves and the need to conjure up a substitute. ""Cars"" director John Lasseter and ""Proximity"" scenarist Ben Queen have skillfully inserted this message into ""Cars 2"" without slighting the shenanigans which made the original comedy such fun. In fact, ""Cars 2"" qualifies as the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor. The chief reason this hilarious sequel tops ""Cars"" is that Lasseter and crew have promoted Lightning McQueen's sidekick Tow Mater to the pole position. Larry the Cable Guy's cinematic career appeared in the pits before he provided the voice for Tow Mater. His redneck accent and cornpone humor made him ideal for a rusted wrecker with no hood and buck teeth sticking out of its grille. Sidekicks have always been scene-stealers, and Tow Mater is virtually the whole show in ""Cars 2."" Mind you, British actor Michael Caine gives Larry the Cable Guy a run for his money, relegating goodie-four tires Lightning McQueen to third place. McQueen still claims his share of screen time. Indeed, he provides the motivation for the plot. Nevertheless, Tow Mater and a gray Aston Martin, voiced by Michael Caine, named Finn McMissile emerge as the leading cars. Unlike the racecars only plot for the original, ""Cars 2"" shifts its gears and combines the usual racing antics with a sophisticated plot about a devious effort to discredit alternative fuel sources. ",0
31,6.0,This felt more like a random animation studio's film than the mighty Pixar's. Cars 2 is seriously lacking in Pixar's trademark depth and maturity. The story is pretty weak and the humor is is not really there. This is probably the lowest point in the iconic studio's filmography.,0
32,8.0,"This is a Disney/Pixar sequel about hot-shot race car Lightening McQueen who travels to Japan with best friend Mater for the World Grand Prix. While McQueen tries to win the race, Mater gets himself caught in the path of Holly Shiftwell and Finn McMissile, spies on a mission to stop a sabotage plot created by old cars called ""lemons."" ",1
33,10.0,"Cars 2 is easily the best film from a usually unemotional, unoriginal studio -- Pixar -- that has finally mastered the art of cinema! This the most intelligent, emotional, and riveting movie since Pulp Fiction. The action is unique and exciting, the animation is stunning and pleasing, and the score is better than every other spy movie. Without all of these flawless technical achievements, Cars 2 would still stand out for its fabulous story and deep, complex characters.",1
34,3.0,"I truly hated watching ""Cars 2"" as it is not only a sequel no one other than John Lassiter wanted but it also has a plot that manages to squeeze all the joy out of the franchise. Additionally, it does something with Mater that I didn't think was possible...it made me hate him about as much as Jar-Jar Binks! Yes, this movie is that bad.",0
35,10.0,"I'm finding myself very disappointed by the generally critics about ""Cars 2"", and I found the nucleus of the issue the fact that Pixar's latest movies have had a very philosophical idea floating around (Wall-e, Up, Toy Story 3) and the ""Cars"" franchise it's not about that.",0
36,10.0,Cars 2 is not what I expected. It was better then I expected back in 2006 when CARS made it's debut it was aimed at younger children like my son who was 2 years old when he saw it in the theatre and it captured his attention. Now my don id 7 years old and his youngest brother is 2 years old and we took them to see CARS 2. They LOVED IT. Cars 2 is not made for adults it is made for kids pure and simple but Cars 2 grew up with it's audience. the theme is the same it is about friendship and being there for your friends and This time it is also about not being afraid to be yourself. The Story is not complicated which is good because it is a kids movie after all and those should never be too complicated. There is more action in this one then the first one and maybe a better story in this one then the first. The only drawback is no Paul Newman who sadly died before he could take his part as Doc Hudson . But We did Get Michael Caine as Finn Mcmissile a secret agent in the James Bond mold. The magic continues. See it and make your mind up for yourself Pixar didn't stumble when they made this flick. They grew up and brought more of the magic with them for us to enjoy.,1

40,6.0,"I enjoyed this movie. It's not as good as the first one, but not many sequels are. But as sequels go, this one is pretty good.",1
41,10.0,The movie is very interesting.Because cars can speak so they are very pretty.You can watch this movie with your grandparents or your child because everybody can watch this movie.Cars is very funny movie.You can learn many things.And you should learn the result of the important events.The writers of the cars are very imaginative people.

42,8.0,"Pixar have had better films, I will admit, but this was actually a good film. I saw this film yesterday, in London, and it was on the big screen and in 3d . I was very impressed by this film and it is very hard to say which one of the cars films was the best.",1
43,6.0,"I enjoy kids movies, I really do. But this fails to deliver a great story. Cars was a good movie with a great plot. But Cars 2 was a mix of stories. The sequels are never like the first one and this is not the exception.",0
44,8.0,"I personally enjoyed the movie very much... It was full of action and had the same old Pixar humor. The only things that critics said that was seriously wrong with the movie was the fact that they build to much on Mater's character... Mater's character in the first one provided comic relief for the movie. In Cars 2, they made the comic relief the main character. The entire movie was based around Mater and that is what made it funny. But for some people there was to much of him and not enough of the original Lightning McQueen. This is a valid point, but it doesn't ruin the movie.. I would suggest watching it for sure!",0
45,5.0,"Pixar Studios makes the best animation films out there, and they've been showing over and over again their elaborateness when making them. Sadly I saw that CARS 2 seemed more like a machinery for money, than a movie with an actual heart. The plot is thin and sadly uninspired, and the actions herein revolves around fast-paced dialog and fire and explosions. The original CARS had charm and atmosphere, and although it wasn't the best piece of Pixar, it had an all-and-all good standard. CARS 2 doesn't have it, and I found myself missing all the good contents that has become trademarks of Pixar's films. This may be a new low for the company and crew, so one can only hope that they'll bounce back and show us that they've still got it.",1
46,3.0,"What the hell is this? I'm surprised Pixar had any hand in the creation of this film. It plays like one of Disney's direct-to-DVD features. A sequel in name only. Cars was a disappointment to me, but I understood it aimed at a younger audience. Cars 2 does this also, but also includes fairly violent scenes, unforgivable stereotypes, and not a single laugh. They choose one of the side characters to be the lead this time around for God knows what reason. They choose the most annoying character of all. An absolute moron of a creation. Worst of all, it gives a message to kids that it's OK to be an ignorant obnoxious fool in other countries, and that it's fine if you're stupid. Why is Mater played out as sympathetic? He literally ruins everything. On top of that we have a plot where the idiot is seen as the hero. This has been done hundreds of times before, but never this poorly. Cars wasn't even an action film to begin with. A change of genre, putting an annoying sidekick as the lead, more terrible puns, and you have Cars 2. The only highlights are the races and action scenes, but at 1 hour and 47 minutes, they really outstay their welcome.",0
47,9.0,I have watched this movie and I would say that it is not as bad as some have written about it over here. It is quite good.,0
48,6.0,Starting where the previous one left of we meet Lightning McQueen completely settled and living in Radiator Springs. Life is good - there's racing events to be won and the company of friends to be enjoyed. During a race event in Japan the wheels of fate are set in motion and McQueen and Mater end up in what can only be described as a cloak and dagger operation. So far for the story.,1

50,4.0,"When I go to see a Pixar movie I expect to be blown away. Cars 2 simply did not. There were many problems with Cars 2, mainly that the story strength just was not there. Yes it did have some funny moments but they were few and far between. The main problem with this movie however was that Pixar made Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, the main character. After 20 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave because of how annoying he was. Larry is annoying as a human, making him a the main character as a car is just stupid. It was honestly the only Pixar movie so far that I left feeling completely nothing. What a disappointment this was as this topped my summer movie list. What a disappointment...",0
51,4.0,"Even though Cars 2 is a Disney/Pixar production about espionage, it's sadly quite boring. I think part of the problem comes from the fact that they rely on most of the humor coming from Mater - and that doesn't work. Mater is like Tabasco sauce, a little bit is fine, but too much is overpowering. This movie just doesn't have the heart that other Pixar films have.",0
52,7.0,"I like these Cars movies and this one was just as good if not a tad better than the original! This time the directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis bring a few new characters to the mix as in Francesco (an indy type car) who after Mater's ( this time voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) bating challenges Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to race him in a championship race in his home country of Italy. Also new to the mix are Pixar's version of James Bond's 007, Finn Mcmissile (Michael Caine) and M Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) two British top super spies who find unknown and very hidden espionage talents within Mater's rusty parts. This second visiting with all the folks of Radiator Springs, brings us more of Mater then Lightning, which some have found annoying, i remember reading one critics review in which he wrote that Pixar had found their very own Jar Jar Binks. Well I for one like the Mater character and found he along with the little forklift that assists him at the garage only adds to the laughs. If you and your family loved the first one then you will definitely love this one as well. I love all the Pixar films and always say bravo to them upon every review!",1
53,5.0,Pixar animation has had a terrific run of films with a high emphasis on quality control. Cars was the one film to have had a decidedly mixed critical response but its international box office led to a sequel with Cars 2.,1
54,7.0,"One prominent notion stood out in my mind after watching ""Cars 2"" - it was the Energizer Bunny on speed, steroids, and any other drug that gives you superhuman endurance. From the opening shot where a British spy operative is communicating oil rig coordinates to suave James Bondesque agent Finn McMissile (voice of the ubiquitous Michael Caine) to the last shot in Radiator Springs where Gomer Pylesque tow truck Mater is hailed as a hero, ""Cars 2"" hits the ground running (or rather, racing) and almost never stops. Cars zipping around, racing, diving, skydiving, flying, the movie is seemingly an adrenaline junkie's dream. It was exciting, up to a point, then it eventually became too noisy and tiresome - like, some would say, a Transformers movie.",1
55,,"This film is about Lightning McQueen racing in the World Grand Prix, and during the process his best friend Mater unknowingly gets involved in covert spy operations.",1
56,7.0,"As many people mentioned before Cars is a movie that didn't deserved a sequel. I mean, talking cars is not the best idea to start with but somehow they managed to bring some emotions in part one. I remember that I was a little bored with the slow pace of the first Cars, but again they tried to connect the audience with the characters ( in my opinion McQueen is not a likable one). In the end Cars was good but it was missing something. Now, the sequel goes a completely different way, and first I thought that was a good and original move, but I also think that Mater has a lot of time on screen and frankly that is annoying ( it is the typical character that always screw things off but hey we love him because he has a big big heart and he will never let his friend down come onÂ¡Â¡Â¡ that is so childlish and its okay for the kids, but we know that Pixar has made it to the top because they connect with kids and adults equally. Im not saying that you will have a bad time, because the movie its entertaining, but it lacks heart and genuine emotions. And that for a Pixar movie is just sad. Hopefully they deliver a better film next year.",0
57,6.0,"Cars 2 (2011): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro: Exciting sequel to the original animated hit. This time the plot involves some secret agent cars and a big Grand Prix race where Lightning McQueen is up against major competition from Italy. Director John Lasseter brought the Toy Story films to life and here again he proves Pixar as a big profit by creating a sequel to Cars that is creative and entertaining. Owen Wilson again voices race car McQueen who returns home to Radiator Springs after several winnings. His return is welcomed by Mater the rusty tow truck whose free spirited red neck antics are often well intentioned but misfiring. When summoned to another challenge he is urged to bring Mater with him. Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater whose persona is scorned but he is also mistaken for an agent. This lands him in some amusing situations that he doesn't fully comprehend until he must save the day. Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer voice two agents who go through several near falls to bring down an evil car tycoon. Even they will have to rely on Mater to prevail when they cannot. John Turturro voices the main racing antagonist and the accent provides some amusing moments as Turturro sneers and charms his way to the finals. Beautifully animated with many funny moments, this film wisely attempts different story aspects through spy clichÃ©s. While it lacks the freshness and originality of the first film, families will likely engage in this rat race of recklessness and completely absurdity. Score: 6 / 10",0
58,,"Pixar had always treaded carefully when it came to follow up films, with only Toy Story getting the honor given its established fan base, and soon, Monsters Inc getting a prequel as well. As to why Cars warranted a second film would be anyone's guess, but I suppose the story allowed some bandwidth to break out of the small town of Radiator Springs and into the big leagues of an international racing circuit to the tune of a lot more merchandise and toys to make money from, that it perhaps proved to be irresistible.",1
59,3.0,"I just came back from the movie. It wouldn't be enough to say that the movie didn't live up to my expectations. It wouldn't be enough to say that this is, by far, the worst Pixar movie. I have to say more. I have to say that there aren't many redeemable qualities in Cars 2. But if I have to select the major problem of this movie is that Pixar has failed to its primary audience. This is a movie with a story extremely difficult to follow, and on top of that, illogic. This is a movie with dozens of explosions and shootings. This is a movie with a duration of almost two hours. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that a long complex illogic movie full of machine guns is not the best fit for the intended audience. I left the theatre thinking... don't these guys run focus groups? How do they come with a failure like this just a year after producing what I regard as the greatest animated movie of all times?

61,7.0,"Cars 2 is actually not a half-bad film as many people are claiming it to be. It's a sequel to the 2006's hit Pixar film, Cars. While Cars turned out to be weakest film Pixar has ever made, it still had a heart and a message. It was more about the drama and relationships between the characters rather than action. Unfortunately, this is the first Pixar film to lack that heart and to substitute it for plain action. As an action fan, I really liked this move. As a Pixar fan, I was wondering what the heck happened.",0

64,10.0,"This film seemed great for the plot on which it was placed , very different from one part which I thought was very childish but with a very beautiful teaching, love cars. Lightning Mcqueen my favorite part favorite Mater realizes how foolishly he has been acting. The criminals use the weapon on McQueen during the race, but nothing happens. Mater escapes to warn his friends of a bomb planted in McQueen's pit, but Finn and Holley find out that the bomb is actually planted in Mater's air-filter. They warn him about the bomb, but he flees to protect his friends. As a reward for his heroism, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen and returns home with his friends, where the cars from the World Grand Prix take part in the unofficial Radiator Springs race. Fillmore reveals that before the last race, Sarge replaced McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel (which prevented McQueen from being affected by the weapon). McMissile and Shiftwell arrive and invite Mater to join them in another spy mission, but he graciously turns it down. He does ask Shiftwell for a date when she returns which she accepts. He gets to keep the rockets they gave him earlier, which he now uses in the Radiator Springs race. Excited!!",1
65,2.0,"Last year, Pixar hit gold with Toy Story 3, which may be their crowning moment of glory. One particularly raved about scene (and understandably why) showed the toys being thrust face first into an inferno, trying their hardest to escape, but ultimately holding hands and coming to the realization that they are going to die. That scene became the most talked about scene in 2010's lists of summer blockbusters, on par with the brilliant fight scene in Inception where Arthur fights a man in a hotel hallway with shifting gravity.

69,7.0,"An animation movie is worth what's worth that's all. But this one has a whirl of stunning images and scenes technically almost perfect and extremely efficient and impressive. The humanized cars are greatly expressive in terms of ""facial"" and ""body"" features and gestures that make us always forget they aren't people. Their movements look human indeed. And we don't see a single human being all through the movie as if the world was peopled with cars behaving like people and showing human feelings and thoughts, some of them being the ""bad"" and some others the ""good"" ones. There also several good humoured sequences like those performed by the tow van character, a really well conceived one. And the reproduction of cities like Paris, London and Italy are very realistic and beautiful almost looking like photos. And the story? Well the story the less important aspect of the movie as it often happens in animation movies. Something about the use of car fuel, the very modern duel between petrol and alternative less polluting fuels which in this story involve a fight between the ""goodies"" who defend the former against the ""baddies"" that try to discredit it in favour of petrol by means of several criminal and violent actions. If you go to see this movie you'll spend a pleasant time having a visual very effective entertainment",1
70,5.0,"Pixar is arguably the last remaining film company with a perfect track record. From Toy Story to Toy Story 3, each of their films had been met with grand acclaim and multiple Academy Awards. However, I can safely say the perfect track record ends this month. Cars 2 is a bafflingly disappointing movie that tastes even more bitter since its coming from Pixar, the makers of the best computer-animated films of all-time. Everything that has made Pixar movies range from decent to incredible to perfect was neglected here: from the mediocre script, to the lack of heart, to the lack of humor, right down to even commercializing their film a bit with some awkward product placements and a multitude of new characters that provide nothing more than just providing more toys to sell. Cars 2 was totally unnecessary, and just didn't deliver in any way shape or form---except for the animation.",0
71,6.0,I like the direction Pixar decided to go with Cars 2. Turning it into a globe-trotting spy flick is a fun and interesting way to continue the story without having to retread anything that happened in the first movie.Â ,0
72,5.0,"On the surface, it didn't seem like there was much cause for a direct sequel to this franchise, but given their track record I had to give Pixar the benefit of the doubt. In reality, it didn't take long for those early worries to be confirmed. This is like a jumbo-sized TV episode with incredible production values but a weak, redundant script. Where the original was, clearly, the worst of Pixar's properties, at least it had an honest message at heart; that the abundance of interstates and high speed traffic has ruined the necessity and charm of small-town America, at once mourning and celebrating that lost taste of cultural charm. By comparison, there's really no reason for Cars 2 to exist. It's a straight-up Saturday morning cartoon, shifting from caper to caper without the benefit of a discernible moral. And while there's really nothing wrong with that - there's an insatiable need for kid's fodder on the big screen, certainly - it's depressing to see it coming from the same company responsible for generation-transcending classics like Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Up. While it'll undoubtedly sell plenty of toys, this was the wrong movie at the wrong time for Pixar, and a rare instance of the studio losing ground to the competition.",0

Perhaps we expect Pixar too much. After the year of 2008, we had wanted to see next Pixar film even better than Wall-E(I think it's the best of all). But can it be easy? Recently I've seen a lot of Hollywood cartoon movies. Among them were some wonderful films, also boring ones. Cars(1%2) is special, which makes me feel totally differently from any other one. The character McQueen impresses me deeply and the relationship between he and Mater is as fantastic as well. I had expected Cars 2 could get a rate of 7.5, at least 7. But it only gets 6.4!

Although I still loved that franchise. So when I saw the trailer of this movie and how there's going to be so much spy movie stuff, I thought it was exactly what I wanted. And I wasn't even wrong.

89,7.0,"So this is a hard review to write. On one hand, Cars 2 is better than 95% of what any other animation studio is putting out (that five percent is home to the odd DreamWorks movie that is actually great like How to Train Your Dragon, and one-off successes from great filmmakers like Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" and Gore Verbinski's ""Rango""), but on the other hand it's a significant step down from the excellence bordering on perfection we've come to expect from Pixar. True, a step down from excellence is still good, but considering the pedigree it's somewhat disappointing; therein lies my quandary. ",1

I was thrilled to see Pixar making a sequel. However, I have to say this one is much darker and has much more action and plays a lot like a spy movie or an episode of Burn Notice or Covert Affairs. I really enjoyed this as a movie and not as a sequel. It is visually superb and has a good message of friendship. However, I found that it just didn't quite have the charm of the first.

He's produced titles like Ratatouille, and has been a voice over in The Incredibles & Ratatouille, so he's no stranger to the Pixar family. Cars 2 was a highly anticipated film, but it clearly fell flat, and missed the mark completely! John Lasseter gave us a messy, unwanted, unoriginal spy sequel. First things first, they should've scrapped EVERYTHING about the spy scheme, and expanded on building Radiators Springs! I was personally excited to see them expand on it, but they decided to go clichÃ© once again, and do a stupid world tour. With the reputation that Pixar has of building worlds, this one was just okay, but could've been so much better, and focused. This may be far fetched, but I got this weird vibe of Rocky 3 & 4 in this film.",0
96,4.0,"Pixar's Cars was easily their weakest feature, yet it certainly had a charm to it. While the car characters themselves looked a little cheap, the world they lived in had nice, pretty detail, and their Rocky Mountain hometown was lovely. Cars 2 not only replaces Cars as Pixar's weakest, it's actually dishearteningly awful. It jettisons every ounce of charm from the original, as well as the detail (probably because it was made as a 3D movie, so the backgrounds aren't going to be seen anyway), and puts Larry the freakin' Cable Guy in the lead (Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen is barely even in the film, and would probably be like fourth billed if not for his contract). This film belongs on the shelf next to Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector and Witless Protection, not Wall-E and Up. The plot has McQueen and 'Mater (Larry's character, if you don't know) going around the world to a series of races so McQueen can prove he's the fastest car alive. 'Mater is mistaken for a secret agent by a James Bond-like Michael Caine-mobile and Emily Mortimer and has to foil an evil plot by someone or other. I really couldn't be bothered to give a damn about any of it. It's very busy, and I'm sure small children will like it, but it's vapid as Hell. It really feels like one of those Disney direct-to-DVD sequels, possibly even worse. Let's hope Pixar will learn its lesson from this one.",0
97,5.0,"Cars 2 is the latest offering by Pixar, the only studio I am aware of that up until now has had a perfect running of first rate films. Cars 2 is finally where the studio giant Pixar takes a big downturn in quality. Don't get me wrong. It is not a horrible film. It has several things working for it, such as creativity and absolutely dazzling animation, but it lacks a story with resonance. The original Cars was a slow grower for me, a movie that got better with each viewing. That is because it had a story with heart, characters you cared about, and a flat out brilliant ending. But everything here works only on the surface. I didn't like the excessiveness of Toy Story 3, Pixar's giant last year, but that still very good film gave screen time to all of the characters we loved and had many moments that were simply magic. There is none of that here, so you're pretty much stuck with an action packed spy movie (a violent one at that - no small kids should watch this one). Mater replaces McQueen as the lead (an unfortunate decision, as a little bit of Mater goes a looong way! That's why he is so much better suited for the short Mater's Tall Tales animated shorts.). McQueen makes a splash on the screen here and there, and that's it. Luigi, Guido, Doc, Flo, Ramone, Red, Sally, Model-T, and Mac get almost no face time and their dialogue is really useless. The plot has twists and turns and ends up being pretty ludicrous. The new characters have no depth to them whatsoever, the only slightly amusing one is Francesco, played by the great John Turturro. Even the stunning international setting of the movie is treated rather haphazardly. We are delighted for a few seconds by beautiful world cities only to have the awe and beauty pulled out from under our feet a few seconds later. Even the race is meaningless to the story. And so it is all spy movie, an average one at that. One can't help but think that Pixar for some weird reason was eager to make another Cars film just to rake in the toy merchandise sales later. They should stop having john Lasseter direct the films. Of all the films, his (with the exception of Toy Story and Toy Story 2) are the weakest. They've got Stanton, Docteur, and Bird who are all fantastic filmmakers and storytellers. And please, get a story that transcends the medium, not plays down to the audience! ",1

99,10.0,"Although the movie isn't educational at first glance, kids will pick up information about alternative fuel and why you should never underestimate your own knowledge and abilities. They also get an amusing look at Japanese, Italian, and English culture and landmarks. Mater learns to stop doubting himself and his intelligence and have the confidence necessary to help defeat the criminals of the story. Lightning McQueen accepts that Mater doesn't need to change to fit in with Lightning's slick racing buddies. Mater is a loving, selfless friend. He's willing to put himself at risk even though he's not really a trained spy. Lightning and Mater are wonderful examples of best friends who may not seem like they have a lot in common but love each other just the way they are and always have each other's backs -- or in this case, trunks. Although there are no real product placements in the movie (aside from car models like the Gremlin and Acer), the Disney merchandise machine has an enormous number of Cars toys and other tie-ins -- from LEGOs and stuffed animals to coloring books and figurines to sippy cups and sleeping bags.",1
100,4.0,"The Cars franchise is something of a stigma among the collective PIXAR fandom: it's detested by the stingiest fans and for good reason, it's not a movie series that exists for good stories but for the merchandising side of things.

The characters haven't really changed and the James Bond-styled caper doesn't save the film from its underwhelming story and non-existent character development. With that said, the animation's still good: almost too good for this $200 million production that exists to sell more Cars toys.",0

Basically, back in the world where cars are the population, there is a spy plot, where British secret agent Finn McMissile (Sir Michael Caine) has gathered some information of suspicious oil reserves, and he needs an undercover agent to join him and his assistant Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) in the mission to see what's going on. Meanwhile, Piston Cup four-time racing champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has returned to Radiator Springs, and he has got himself a place to race in the World Grand Prix, thanks to his good friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The event is to promote Allinol biofuel, being promoted by green power advocate Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), and the race goes to Tokyo where McQueen will go against his challenge Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). Originally American spy Rod 'Torque' Redline (Bruce Campbell) was meant to be completing the spy mission, but he is compromised by the henchmen of Professor ZÃ¼ndapp (a ZÃ¼ndapp Janus 250) (Thomas Kretschmann), but he manages to pass the gathered information onto Mater, so the British spies mistake him as their contact, and while racing McQueen overhears their conversation and is distracted in the race to lose. The next race moves to Italy, and Mater has fallen out with McQueen, and McMissile and Shiftwell tell him everything they know so that he will carry out their mission, to investigate Allinol biofuel, which has been suspended for the final race in England, but McQueen is still using it despite this. After getting the British spies into trouble Mater realises his foolishness at times, and he has to save his friend when there is an assassination plot, involving a bomb that will detonate if he gets too close to his friend, but it was not ZÃ¼ndapp who set the bomb. Eventually as the bomb countdown clock nears the point of explosion the true lead villain reveals himself as the one who can deactivate it, Axlerod is the mastermind, and in the end he and his whole organisation are arrested, Mater gets a knighthood from the The Queen (a Rolls Royce Phantom) (Vanessa Redgrave) and a date with Shiftwell, and he and McQueen have fun racing in various places around the world. Also starring Bonnie Hunt as Sally (a 2002 Porsche 911 Carrera), Cheech Marin as Ramone (1959 Chevrolet Impala Lowrider), John Ratzenberger as Mack (1985 Mack Super-Liner), Jason Isaacs as Siddeley, Tony Shalhoub as Luigi (a 1959 Fiat 500), Lewis Hamilton, Joe Mantegna as Grem (an AMC Gremlin), Peter Jacobson as Acer (an AMC Pacer), Brent Musburger as Brent Mustangburger, Richard Kind as Van and John Lasseter as John Lassetire (a Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck). The voice casting is still as good as before, there are certainly more recognisable talents and cameos, including new additions Caine and Mortimer adding some intrigue, the story is a little wonky and sometimes too much to get used to, but the James Bond style stuff is fun enough, the characters are all likable, especially Mater who gets a more starring role, it may not be as much of a highlight as the first film, but for the family it is an alright animated comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Worth watching!",1

113,8.0,"You know, I had a feeling Pixar was going to have a backlash going against them someday and wasn't too surprised it was during the release of Cars 2, but I didn't think it would seem a 180 degree like I've assumed from many negative comments about this movie I've read here and other sites. Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, when I saw the trailer for this one and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) made that joke about the pope-mobile and about having ""average intelligence"", I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. But now that I have, I'll now say that I highly enjoyed this almost as much as I've enjoyed the previous ones made by this highly creative company. Action scenes are great, there are plenty of humorous moments that are easily laughable mostly concerning Mater, and I liked the additions of Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as British spies mistaking Mater for a fellow agent. And Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen is still useful as a character despite not being on screen as much as in the previous Cars. So on that note, I highly recommend Cars 2 to anyone who's willing to not let Pixar's reputation bring them down simply because this one isn't as creatively nourishing as those previous others. P.S.

The last time I saw this was in a theater in 2011, and I remember liking it just fine. Knowing that this was notoriously deemed Pixar's worst movie, I had low expectations. I came out of it pleasantly surprised, yet I still completely understand why everyone hates it so much. It doesn't have the same magic as the first one at all, and mainly focuses on Tow Mater instead of Lightning McQueen, which was a decision I couldn't be bothered to wonder how it passed in the writing stages. I came to watch Lightning McQueen, not a Mater spy movie. With that being said, I do believe this movie is heavily underrated. It's not the funniest Pixar movie, however it still found ways to make me laugh. They handled the Spy part surprisingly well considering how stupid the decision was.

Mater is a dumb tow-truck used for comic-relief and nothing in the first film even hints at anything more than that, and this film makes it seem as if mater is some sort of hero, when he is not.<br /><br />When you want to make a sequel of a film, a good way to do that is to answer a frequently asked question about the film's universe and solve it by making the film. For example, Toy Story's universe sought the question ""What happens to toys when they are abandoned?"" and made a sequel out of it. I don't think anyone in their right mind would watch Cars and think ""I wonder where the spy cars are?"" It is such a stupid and unnecessary way to expand the universe.<br /><br />The plot makes absolutely zero sense. The villains are oil diggers, and make prophet from cars buying oil. Their evil plan was to make Allinal (Alternative fuel) look bad by blowing up cars so that the public will stick to oil. However the creator of Allinal is in on the evil cars' plan. So they basically created alternative fuel just to make it look bad so people can stop using it, and use oil, EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WAS ALREADY USING OIL!<br /><br />Mater somehow is the one to figure out who the bad guy is. If you watch the scene where he figures it out, it's just so hilariously bad that it hurts. Somehow, Mater was able to figure out Axlerod's plan even though it was so idiotic that even the Spy cars right next to him couldn't figure it out, because it just wouldn't make sense for it to happen. Cars 1 made Mater to be an unintelligent side character, but he is somehow able to solve a mystery that Spy cars who are trained in this field couldn't figure out.<br /><br />I don't usually poke at movies for being convenient, since just about every film is at least slightly convenient, but this film takes it to another level. For this film to work, you have to have the evil cars come up with an idiotic plan that makes no sense. The intelligent spy cars must be dumb enough to believe that Mater is the American Spy. You also have to have lightning McQueen be dumb enough to believe Mater is talking to him during the first race. Then you have to have Lightning go against literally everything he learned in the first film just so Mater can get sad and try to leave on a plane. Finally you need Mater to figure out the stupid evil plan that the spy cars couldn't even figure out.<br /><br />Everything that this film does is something way off of what the first film created. I am all for the expanding of a universe if done good, and it isn't done good in this film. The only slightly interesting and accurate- to-the-universe plot in this film is quickly abandoned at the end with no real conclusion.<br /><br />Every little detail in this film seems to be there just so they could make a prophet on it from Toys. For example, the rocket jets, giant cars (that show up for a good 5 seconds in the actual film) and even the freaking wannabe race cars that the film never even explored.<br /><br />From 1995-2010 Pixar made nothing but spectacular, intriguing, heartwarming films. This was the first Pixar film that wasn't good, and it was also their first non-Toy Story Sequel. Like I said, From 1995-2010 all of Pixar's films were great, and from 2011-2018 (Present) There are only 3 films (out of the 9 they made) that I believe live up to the standards of the 2000s Pixar Films. What I'm trying to say, is that this film was the beginning of Pixar's downfall.<br /><br />And that is why this film is one of my least favorite films of all time.",0

124,3.0,"I was so looking forward to Cars 2. The action and the animation are very exciting and eye catching. However, the story was lacking. It did not have the magic of the first one. More importantly, Pixar had to slide a politically correct, liberal, environmentalist theme in it with the 'alternative fuel' topic. I am so sick and tired of the hoax that is 'global warming', hearing about 'go green' and how gas / oil is the great evil. I didn't need two hours of that garbage shoved down my throat. If that agenda had been left out of the movie, it would have been much more enjoyable. It was good to see the characters again. There will be plenty of ideas for the diecast Cars characters collectors (which I am one). However, the 2nd movie just does not measure up to the first one. The music soundtrack of the first one blows this one away. There were very few songs in this one. Go see it just because it has been 5 years of waiting. Just don't get your hopes too high.",0

127,4.0,"Pixar's Cars is now remembered as one of the great studio's rare misfires; a formulaic animated movie that had far more to offer to the children in the audience than to the adults paying for them to be there (although I think it's one of their most misunderstood movies and well worth a re-visit). Despite this, it was a box-office smash and a dream in terms of merchandising. A few years ago, Pixar may have thought twice about extending the story of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and the town of Radiator Springs without having something new to say, but ever since Disney took over, they've taken a more relaxed attitude towards bending to audience demand and churning out an underdeveloped and unworthy sequel. The result is Cars 2, a mess of a movie with an absence of any real laughs that feels like a straight-to-DVD short stretched out over 106 minutes.",1

129,4.0,I love Pixar movies and shorts and I enjoyed the first Cars. But I can honestly say that this is Pixar's first misstep. Let me start with the excessive violence that this movie presents. It's opening sequence alone makes me question some of the decisions Pixar make of this movie. The graphics continue to be stellar but the story is subpar and that's what we go to Pixar movies for. Also with Pixar their previous films are as entertaining for adults and children which is not the case for this story at all. It has too many adult themes and is kind of boring for children. Lastly this movie is preachy and lacks the usual heart found in previous Pixar films.,0

After the terrible criticism this bold and different movie received, Pixar just lost their nerve. They made safe * good for rotten tomatoes* movies. What about inside out? You ask. Yes, its good at a creative level. But there is no strong opponent or conflict, leaving you unsatisfied about the story (i haven't seen coco, yet).<br /><br />Coming to this film, there is good action, but the story is too complicated for kids (Pixar films are aimed at adults too).

To this day, there hasn't been a Pixar movie that hasn't been bad as this and I think it should stay that way. This is a good example of a movie that was made for merchandise only, I mean I remember seeing merchandise based on this movie everywhere and it is ridicules.

Now let's all agree that Pixar learned their lesson and will never make a movie as bad as this, hopefully.

Not only did Pixar disappoint with an overstuffed plot that was not amusing in the slightest, they decided to get all preachy about alternative fuels. So I suppose all that merchandise that is loading down half the shelves in Wal-Mart and Target are all made from recycled plastic in eco friendly factories? Or that the money from the film is being donated to help those who HAVE been adversely affected by oil spills and toxic run-offs? If there's one thing I hate when going into a movie it's being preached at by the entertainment industry. Just like with Wall-E, I was incensed at the ridiculous audacity of ANYONE in the entertainment industry getting on some high horse about the environment. Of all the trash-making industries in the world, the entertainment industry is by far the most disposable. We could all do better by switching to bio-fuels and we could all do with less stuff. We don't need to be told that by effing Disney. I love movies, don't get me wrong. If they stopped making movies tomorrow, I would cry. A lot. I just really hate it when an incredibly stinking rich company waggles their finger at commercialism/consumerism/pollution all the while they are busy destroying our environment making toys, DVDs, and cheap clothes - in China.

The points where i feel this film fell short was that the story was pretty strange for a film that was originally meant to be about racing and the spy aspect did feel a little bit off. what I found very odd in a film that is a U was the level of death and i know that might be a strange thing to say since all the characters are all cars so what does it matter if they get blown to peaces but aren't people meant to be able to relate to these characters and if some of the things that happened in this film happened to real people then this film would at least be a twelve. However this film is a great peace of summer fun and is much more enjoyable that most of the films that have been released this summer.,1
163,5.0,"Visually dizzying and emotionally empty, Cars 2 is an amazingly indulgent piece that seems to throw out the Pixar ""story"" book in favor of strained plot and graphic excess. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. This is reported to have started as a film-within-a-film from the first Cars, and perhaps it would have worked well as a longer short. As a feature, though, it lacks anyone to care about and any reason to care about them. And while it may be family-friendly in the broadest sense of the term, it is not for young children - some scenes are dismally intense, and the by-the-numbers plot will still lose them. I saw it with a 7- and 9-year-old, and they were not impressed. ""The first one was better"" was the general agreement. Lasseter and company should perhaps consider another Robert McKee seminar before moving forward with the Monsters Inc. sequel. Five stars out of 10 for 25 years of really great film making.",0

It's light on the emotion but this time it knows it, we don't get any ham-fisted attempts at causing the audience to well-up with expository dumps, and it tootles along with an almost ostentatious streak - helped by some wonderful casting choices, Bruce Campbell included - as the new spy plot is shamelessly mashed with the racing motif from the first in an unsuccessful amalgamation that feels more like fan-fiction than serious sequel fare.

202,1.0,"We start off with Agent Finn McMissile riding out to a bunch of oil rigs that are on fire (I'm no mechanic but I'm pretty sure that oil and fire should be kept as far away from each other as possible). Anyway, he sees Professor Z (ZÃ¼ndapp) look at a video camera and goes to get a closer look (and the professor is German because, well, the Germans have already given us Uwe Boll, The Human Centipede, and both world wars). We then cut to the town and meet Lightning and the other characters including Mater, the star of this movie. Meanwhile, Lightning spends some time with his girlfriend Sally at a restaurant where the learn that an oil tycoon named Miles Axel is organizing a worldwide race, which Lightning gets invited to join even though he's supposedly on vacation. Sally forces him to take Mater along and they head for Towkyo (that's not a typo). The movie then takes a break to have them see the sights before cutting to Mater acting like an idiot and embarrassing Lightning, who's meeting this Italian car that he will be competing against. While all this is happening Finn meets someone called Holly and they decide that they need to find another agent. Meanwhile, Mater mistakes wasabi for ice cream and rushes to a water fountain (FYI: water inflames the taste of spicy food. You want to drink milk). Then some goons attack an agent in the bathroom and the agent puts his tracking beacon on Mater. So Holly thinks that Mater's a spy and Mater thinks he's got a date. It's now revealed that Allinol becomes extremely dangerous when hit by an electromagnetic pulse, so we now have a torture scene. The agent being tortured reveals that Mater is the spy. While Lightning is racing, the evil spies use the camera to blow the racers' engines. Holly hijacks Mater's communication, which somehow causes Lightning to lose the race, and when confronted, Mater says that his girlfriend is just a voice in his head. In both movies Mater makes Patrick Star look like a genius, now he's apparently schizophrenic as well. Mater is thinking about going home but Finn interrupts him and explains that there's suspicion that Allinol could have caused the crashes. Mater goes back with Finn and Holly to their layer, where they look at a picture that they managed to take. Finn and Holly think that the photo is a dead end but Mater notices a bunch of boxes hidden in it, which apparently Finn and Holly didn't notice. That's the only thing of interest in the photo! They never would have passed kindergarten, let alone spy training! The cars then head to Italy and Finn and Holly try to disguise Mater. For the final disguise, they have to fix Mater's dents, thus prompting Mater to boast about how he got his dents from hanging out with Lightning. If that's the case, then how come he was dented even before he met Lightning? This is where we learn about the term ""lemon"" from Mater, cars that don't ever work right. All the cars in this plot are lemons. Meanwhile, Lightning partakes in the second part of the race, which as a whole should have been the focus of the entire movie. Holly then asks a tow truck for help, planning to replace him with Mater. The problem is that Mater has a very distinct voice, so hopefully they'll do something to change it. But instead they have him not talk but he accidentally does so and gets caught. The next scene features a whole bunch of cars at a meeting. I can't help but that in this scene there's a bowl of fruit on the table, so I guess there's organic matter in this world after all. The boss then talks to them through a video that only shows his butt (do cars have-oh never mind). Why can't he do use an intercom if he doesn't want to be seen? Anyway, he tells them they're all outdated models and nobody makes parts for them anymore. That's like not making pacemakers anymore because the only people who use them are too old! I won't give away the rest but this is certainly a car-wreck.",0

207,4.0,"Cars 2 was a movie that I expected, hands down, to be Pixar's worst movie. And after seeing it, it actually isn't, though the amount of polarization it has is close to films like Robin Hood or The Good Dinosaur, except worse. The story throughout most of the film is rather clunky and often goes by way too inconsistently (the last act nearly fixes this), doesn't solve questions we had about its universe in the first Cars, and preaches some questionable and even objectionable messages (some comments detail this). The sole undeniable plus about this film is its animation (because, you know, Pixar), depicting the settings superbly and with so many colors, even if it depicts more explosions than a Michael Bay movie. The characters are the most mixed of all, though the highest point they can reach is the tolerable-yet-forgettable zone. The James Bond style characters introduced here were closer to the top than the racing characters, especially Francesco. For most of the movie, Mater was quite boring or insufferable, though inched his way more towards tolerable by the last act. It all sums up to be a movie that I would advise you skip, no matter how much it improves its elements compared to Cars.",0
208,5.0,"Cars 2 is a jarring sequel to Cars. While the first is a very sweet movie that charms viewers of all ages with its ""fish out of water"" story that explores the value of true friendship - the sequel is an espionage movie, with nods to James Bond, The Man Who Knew Too Much etc. It's full of guns, bombs, explosions, fighting etc. The plot is very complicated and involves an environmental message about alternative fuels. Many cars are ""killed"". It was a terrific movie for my 11 year old son (who loved it) but it really scared my 4 year old son - whose favourite movie is Cars. The script and visuals are clever as always (up to Pixar standards) but this film's intended audience does not seem to include Cars' youngest fans. I was slightly disappointed on behalf of the many young kids at our screening who idolize these characters. The film is more in line with the action and violence of The Incredibles which I loved but will not be showing my youngest until he is older. Parents be warned - probably more appropriate for 8 or 9 yr old children and up. Final note, the Toy Story short at the beginning was delightful.

They never settled with an OK-job, they always aimed for excellence. However in Cars 2 they didn't prove it so. I can't complain about the excellent visual effects and the majestic settings, but the script just didn't prove to be Pixar material. It was a risky move taking a supporting character and giving it a leading role, which didn't work as well as I expected.

215,8.0,"Let me start out by saying this in no way is a movie for children. Animation is considered an art form, my father in law believes it to be nothing more than kids movies. How wrong is he?

We say goodbye to dear old Radiator Springs pretty early on, but hello to rest of the world. Lightning McQueen is invited to take art in the WORLD GRAND PRIX, run by a Billionaire Jeep that has created an alternative fuel to replace gas. Fun ensues. With the leap in technology since the first film, Pixar brings even further into the movie by using incredible point of view shots from inside the car and next to it, you can really feel how fast the cars are travelling. I would love to see the networks stacks Pixar uses to render the countries used in this movie because WOW are they pretty. We see France, Italy, Japan; its all so pretty. The Story of Cars 2 cruises at a good pace, introducing all the important players from the start. Michael Cain here as Finn MacMissile is great, easily the best part of the movie. The action is heart pounding and the heart that Mater brings to this action movie is a tremendous object to balance the film. I wont go too far into the story line, just know that this is more Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's James Bond than it is anything else. Gritty, cartoonishly violent and over the top. The visuals here are insane and the story (as Pixar's always done) has hugely deep under currents all the way through it, from death and extortion, to gambling, match fixing, deceit and the race to find a greener way for human kind to exist. Im so glad Pixar is taking steps toward more openly adult films, hopefully the can shrug the childish stigma attached to them.",1

237,4.0,"""Cars 2"" (2011), after the release of ""Cars"" (2006), I figured that surely they wouldn't be dumb enough to do a sequel. ""Cars"", in my opinion, is Pixar's first dud. A weak movie, but still enjoyable though. Then, there came the announcement for ""Cars 2"". I just thought to myself: ""what?! This was the big demand? A sequel for 'Cars'? 'Cars'?! Why didn't they make 'The Incredibles 2'? Or, I don't know, any other film?"" But, since it was made by the one, and only Pixar Animation Studios, I decided to give it a fair chance and go see it in the theater. I did enjoy it somewhat the first time. However, the more I watched it, the more problems continued to emerge. ""Cars 2"" has devolved into, in my personal opinion, the worst Pixar movie I've seen so far! It has a convoluted story, standard to terrible voice acting and boring locations. The plot is, Lightning McQueen brings Mater with him on his racing tour around the world. Before the races begin, Mater ends up being mistaken for an American spy car and joins two secret agent cars to help them save the world from an evil car who intends on using lethal fuel to destroy other cars. Yeah, it's every bit as discombobulated is it sounds. There is way too much going on for one film, all the jokes fall flat and after the ""movie"" is over you just feel cold and empty. It's such an amazement that so much is going on during this ""film"", and I just don't give a crap. How is that possible? The story makes next to no sense. When, at any point, did the first movie have anything to do with espionage or spying? Now granted, they were on the right track with trying to make this ""film"" have it's own unique storyline in order to contrast with the first movie. Granted, some of the scenes, particularly a few of the action scenes, are well-done. But sadly, those scenes amount to nothing. Probably, the biggest issue is that they made Mater the main character, and he's supposed to be the comic relief. That's one of the most important rules of films and TV shows, never make the comic relief the main character! You need a foil to help balance everything out. What they should have done, was get Lightning McQueen to be roped into the secret agent business with Mater. Besides, the whole worldwide racing event is shoved to the side for this pointless spy adventure tie-in! Also, a lot of the lines just make me cringe when I hear them. The writing is nothing short of a joke in this ""movie"". It's unbelievable, a story of this caliber coming from the great Pixar Animation Studio! The plot for this ""film"" is so stupid, that it actually almost sounds like some other studio wrote the script and sent it to them. What a shame! Although, to be honest, I think the studio was more keen on selling toys than making a genuinely entertaining film. Earth to Disney and Pixar; you're both movie studios, not toy factories! As for the acting, it's overall just a total letdown from the whole cast. The only ones who seem to be trying, are: Owen Wilson, Emily Mortimer, Michael Caine and John Ratzenberger. Everyone else is just standard to horrible. But, the worst performance, by far, comes from Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. Keep in mind, I did enjoy Mater in the first movie. He got a few laughs out of me. As for this ""film"", he has hit rock bottom and has become the worst and most annoying character in the ""movie"". Isn't that sad? I think the reason why I liked him more in the first film, is because he had less screen-time. Therefore, his humor had a stronger impact. In the case of his character, less is more. When Mater is the main character, he is just beyond obnoxious! Some of the locations in the ""movie"" are a bit dull. But, there are a lot of them that are decent. Now, let's get into the only two positive elements in this pile of filth. The animation in this ""film"" is fantastic, which is a given for Pixar Animation Studios. All of their movies are very well animated, and this one is definitely no exception. Finally, the soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is excellent. Most of the film scores he writes and composes are great, and this one is no different. Although, I think the music is trying harder than everything else! ""Cars 2"" is a major disappointment in the world of CGI animated films. This is easily, in my opinion, the worst Pixar movie I've seen (so far). But, it does have some redemption though. If this is the worst a studio can produce, then you know that you have an outstanding animation studio! I'm giving this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I have to tell you to avoid ""Cars 2""? Just watch any other Pixar film except for this one. Otherwise, you might just find yourself being towed away by Mater the tow truck!",0

Disney and Pixar aren't out to trick the audience and keep them guessing, they are out to entertain you and leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end, this is Disney and Pixar not Paramount or Lion's gate, they make family films people. That being said, I thought this movie was very entertaining. It had much more action in it and a great story. Personally I'm glad they focused more on Mater, I think his character is far more enjoyable than the dry and boring lightning mcqueen voiced by Owen Wilson who if you've seen one of his movies you've seen the character he acts out in every single movie he's been in. The animation in this movie was astounding. I graduated from college with a degree in video game art and design, I know first hand what goes into these kinds of pictures and Pixar has once again proved why they are the best 3D animation company out there. Their work is flawless. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone. I find it sad that people are reviewing this movie like its a educated thriller, take it for what it is - an entertaining family film. I brought my son and I don't know who enjoyed it more.",1

While I'm sure we would have done well to get in touch with our inner Heather Graham, we just didn't think it fair to toss a pair of bad grades at a movie aimed at little girls. We'd much prefer tugging on their pig-tails and saying they have cooties. That being said, Pixar has always presented itself as not only the superior animated movie product to beat, it typically produces films that are creatively accessible on multiple levels. In fact within Wall-E and Up there are segments of pretty high end pieces of cinema. So for that reason, we're reviewing Cars 2.",0

My little son - he was probably 6 at the time - was sitting next to me, and right in the middle of this dull section, he turns to me and says, ""Dad? How many letters are in my name?"" I must have laughed for five minutes. I thought, Oh, man, this movie has lost this little boy. His mind has been wandering, trying to figure out how many letters there are in his name. So I told my wife, Nancy, what he said, and she started laughing, and then the story went down the row through my whole family, our four other sons, and we're sitting there as a family giggling and laughing.

The many locations this movie goes, is fun but it doesnt have same feeling as in the cozy Radiator Springs. I like Mater he's fun but him being spy just doesn't feel is like his character.

Would this studio ever make a disappointment? After outdoing themselves several times over in the last few years (""Ratatouille"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" in particular), Pixar finally made a film that was below par. Another studio could get away with a film like this, but coming from Pixar, who have set the bar so high in the animated medium, it's almost unacceptable. ""Cars 2"" had a lot of potential. The brilliant opening scene should be an indicator of that. Director Brad Lewis (before John Lasseter had to come in and save the sinking ship) had a project on his hands with so many possibilities. They did one thing right, they showed us the world of ""Cars"". We saw Italy, Japan, England and France. However, ""Cars 2"" could've been a great around-the-world adventure.

The animation is top-notch as always, but the new characters, while visually interesting, fail to leave a lasting impression.

(aged 3) To say i was disappointed is an understatement - I am currently watching the original on BBC1 and 20 minutes in I am already enjoying it more than today's viewing of Cars 2. Little gems such as Mater's ""He did WHAT in his cup?"" were not there to add the adult humour to the film and a running time of near on 2 hours meant my friend's (nearly) 4 year old was bored nearly to tears by then end of it! In my opinion Disney / Pixar have left it FAR too long to bring out a sequel, a sequel that should, in fact have never been made as there have been other films since that are significantly better. It lacks the depth of Toy Story (in as much as a kid's film can have depth) and the likability of Monster's Inc - it also lacks the ""aww"" factor of ""Up"" and felt to me as if Pixar were trying too hard to make something to suit all ages and failed in the process. Although Cars 2 is funny in parts, it is in NO way as good as previous Pixar treats and I was sorely disappointed, as was my friend's little boy who LOVED Cars so much my best friend and I were almost ready to buy shares in merchandising for it! I do hope this is not the start of a company who have made some real gems just battering out any old tosh to keep the money coming in!",0

262,6.0,"This movie is a different type of movie than Cars (2006). The first one was about respect and racing, but this one was more about acceptance and espionage, which is generally a good story base. But I got the feeling of that the production tried too much of making this film based on a different taste. The story of espionage is both alright and not, because it has some good action, but it gets too much. The first one felt like real cars, but this one felt more like fantasy cars, because they suddenly could fly, climb and do other stuff that didn't catch my interest. I think Mater is a funny character, but I also think it was a mistake to let him be the protagonist. To me, Lightning McQueen is the main character of the Cars trilogy (2006-2017), and it's all about racing and family. Therefore, this one felt more like a spin-off movie.",0

264,6.0,"Pixar's first sequel to one of their other films aside from the Toy Story series (and I think their might be a third coming in this one). I will say when I first watched this ""007"" themed catastrophe, I was quite confused and a bit overstimulated. As I kept watching it though, it actually grew on me much more than I expected. Even from when they developed the early previews and teasers for this film, I (and I'm sure almost everyone else) personally thought it was strange to go from a more country-style caring and love story to a secret agent/mystery suspense phenomenon. I will say though that the whole world-of-cars theme was really cool from seeing the bright-lighted sights of Tokyo to the posh environment of London. It was also cool to see a large amount of new ""live"" vehicles like the war ships from the beginning of the film and the planes from the airport. Finn McMissile was a styling new character cleverly voiced by Michael Cane (from the new Batman series). Of course out of all the different misfits, the film still had some good charm that relates to the first film, like McQueen getting into another collision between unsuitable instances and another teachable moment that talked about friendship. This may have been a low for Pixar, but their films do continue to raise enough interest and warm-hearted moments after this one. A pretty decent film overall.",1

The film focuses on Mater and it's more of a self discovery of his character than about Lightning McQueen which was quite cool. They travel a lot in this film and you see Japan, Italy and England which was really good, and it felt so real because of the brilliant animation. The new characters voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer as spies were a great addition to the film. However, I hate to criticise a PIXAR film but for a sequel it felt a bit relaxed, in a way of thinking ""Cars was great, we don't really need to develop anymore"" until the whole spy plot kicks in but it should have thrown itself into the new plot instead of lingering from what made the first one great.

Cars 2 was mid at best.,1
283,6.0,"It seems clichÃ© nowadays to critique Pixar's work by comparing it to their previous resume, but at a certain point, it is unavoidable. After two decades of churning out successful, critically acclaimed films, Pixar's name has become synonymous with quality animation, making them almost indisputably the most trustworthy studio in Hollywood. However, such a lofty reputation elicits even loftier standards. Considering the fact that general consensus has established that Cars is Pixar's worst film (meaning it is only very good instead of spectacular), it is no surprise that the release of that movie's sequel was met with comparatively low expectations. I'll be the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Cars and find its status undeserved (both Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are mediocre, in my humble opinion), so I prayed that Cars 2 would surprise everyone by continuing Pixar's streak â€“ and besides, at least at the time, a spy movie with cars seemed kind of genius.

Mater is very annoying and not that funny, and they just don't focus enough on Mc-queen. But the trailer at least looked better than Planes (I haven't seen it, but I don't want to because it looks dumb and it gets a lot of hate.) I hope Cars 3 improves from this because if it doesn't, the franchise is dead. The story is an oil spill compared to the first because they had to ad spies.

Although the animation was quite good and there were some fun references to race car legends, James Bond movies, and human relationships, within a few minutes of the start of the movie I began to sense that the Pixar magic was nowhere be found. The plot was unlikely and only a few of the beloved cast of the original movie were utilized to any significant extent. Too often the crutch of the chase scene was utilized, to hide the lack of the depth of character development I've come to expect from the legends of Emeryville. As if this weren't disappointing enough, the story also had a predictable uber-villain Nazi-big-oil caricature complete with monocle.

Mater was my favorite character from Cars, so I was delighted to see that Cars 2 made him the star. I loved the message of this movie: that everyone has something special to offer and anyone can be a hero. That the guy who looks and sounds like a goofy hick might have a lot more going on ""under the hood"" than people will give him or her credit for. And McQueen continues to learn important lessons about humility and friendship that he still didn't quite master in the first Cars, so that's all good as well. I have no idea what so many of the reviewers here have against this movie. It is very well made, extremely entertaining and the ""violence"" is hardly anything to worry about in this day and age.

Yes, it may not be exactly like other Pixar movies, but hey! You can't expect them to make artistic movies all time. The animation is fantabulous. Especially the scenes in London and Italy, the background imagery was very realistic. The action sequences in this spy game are again mesmerizing. For someone who dreams to have torpedoes and stun-guns fitted to his/her car, this movie is a real dream come true. Visually the scenes are mind-blowing. Radiator springs with its usual canyon looks, Tokyo with an array of display lights, Italy with the beautiful reverie like setting and finally London with its Bentley Ben (Big Ben) and the Queen of course!

There are scenes of violence that may scare the more sensitive kids in the world; two cars get severely beaten for spilling beer all over the pup patrons but trust me, Cars 2 is much, much, much, much better than Cars.

There is some charm, but for the most part the movie is much more violent and complicated than any other Pixar film I can think of. My father in law struggled to follow the story - and it's convoluted enough it's hard to articulately explain. Whereas Cars had a classy charm to it and a memorable soundtrack, this lacked a likable story and any music that was the least bit interesting. I can't believe that Cars 2 actually came out of the same studio. It's not terrible, but you shouldn't see this movie expecting any of the ""magic"" and innovation that Cars had. This movie is all explosions and drama.",1
327,,"Cars 2 has the pacing of a long Chevron commercial with nice visuals. Pixar's track record has been close to untouchable when crafting their films. Their movie are geared toward children with the thought process of parents interest in mind. They create intelligent, emotionally driven, beautifully detailed animated films, with plenty of humor and heart to appeal to movie for parents and children both to enjoy. With this in mind the creators of films behind the Pixar brand forgot about these elements when making a sequel to the off center original. The makers of the first Cars shied away from those various things to a certain degree and just intended the film to be loved by kids. Cars one was not a bad film at all just not as good or on the same level as its counterparts.The first Cars turn out nice box office numbers despite the some bad reviews by Pixar fans and what they were looking for, but hit home to the children expectation and imagination. In knowing that, this movie take that leap again that the first movie makes and tries to leap again and falls short of the capable entertainment. Cars 2 does not feel like a Pixar film at all, but resembles something that Dream works ( not hating on those movies) would have put out. It does not connect with me emotionally as a fan of Pixars various other films. Kids will enjoy every minute of this, witnessing all the new automobiles that the movie presents on the course of it's running time, but for older generation this movie may be a hit and miss. I for one did not care for the route that this film took and making a sequel. In viewing the first movie at the end of it I felt that it was a complete movie not needing a forced sequel like it received.The movie sequel feels like a straight to DVD quality film or a cartoon movie that would be screened on Disney channel or children networks. They also didn't explored the characters that were loved in the first movie. Every scene the audience was introduced to a new character which became the down fall of this film. They displayed some nice roles, but overcrowded the story of the two main characters that we wanted to know more about. Besides the action and some nicely displayed cars that made it to the film this movie just loses it's flame that it had in the first. The director placed the whole spy flick theme into the film to serve as a distraction for kids so they can introduce new cars. The plot didn't fit right with the whole world of Cars 1. One thing that Disney has done in this film that made it a passable movie is add this element to introduce the action that the first movie didn't have. They knew that another Cars original story line would not work a second time so they went this route to create another film for kids. The idea that Pixar has done was smart and inventive to capitalize on merchandize, but it was a fail attempt.This movie also lacks in comedy and heart that was also present in the first movie, but improve on the visual which are beautiful. Mator became annoying at times and served no purpose while he was on screen and I just never connected to the film as a older audience member. That is how this movie lacks the Pixar brand name influence because it falls short in those categories. Compared to the numerous dazzling hits that Pixar Studio has released in the past years, this film is a great disappointment to their track record, but can still achieve box office glory with the amount of fans of the first that this franchise has. With the growing number of animation films that have been put out in the last 10 years that are not under the umbrella of Pixar Studio's, this film still couldn't make the list of the top animation movies to date.",1

The 2nd quarter is where it got bad, no good parts at all, Franchesco was your one of the mill show off nothing more nothing less. It felt so same old same old. Then it got even worse by the 3rd quarter. Mater, Finn, and Holly took up way too much of it with their boring side story. The only good thing was that the the race tracks were cool and unique.

Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project.

362,7.0,"I understand why some movie critics are saying that Cars 2 is not Pixar's best flick. However I won't say it is a bad film, because Pixar simply does not make bad films, they might make good films without the right one-two punch combination, and certainly Cars 2 is one of those films. This is not a bad movie since the superb animation effects are there and so is the astonishing attention to details, especially on the Italian and Londonese city locations, simply these blew me away, not to mention the never ending action sequences. But, and yes, there is a but, probably Cars 2 will not fit all children interest, especially the younger ones due to the violent scenes and the political and espionage intrigue suitable for young and older adults. And that is what I dislike about Cars 2. Some do not like Mater as the main character of the film, but remember, the title of both Cars and Cars 2 (in plural) dresses not one protagonist but more than one if you will. The same argument I have for the Toy Stories trilogy, in TS 1, Woody is the hero, in TS 2 Buzz Lightyear is the hero and in TS 3 every character stands out for the same cause. Pixar is and will continue to be the industry leader in CGI animation, although Dreamworks and Blue Sky have their success, still Pixar knows how to deliver fun, excitement, action, story and emotion to their flicks. In Cars 2 is was the action, excitement and technical cues that stood out, but again, not all movies are the same, you have to constantly look out in every direction possible in order to succeed.",1

After all these movies are for kids and if the kids like them then they succeeded. Even though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as my 5 year old nephew did it shouldn't matter what I think. He loved every minute of it! That is their target audience so Pixar did well once again. I kind of liked that this story was about Mater and not McQueen and that new characters were introduced. That could have been why critics didn't like. I also liked that they go outside of Radiator Springs and travel the world.,1

But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words.

I'm surprised to see the low ratings for this compared to a lot of the other over-rated dreck out there. For example, ""Rio"" looks spectacular, but the plot is borrowed from several other Disney movies and the writing is right on par with George Lucas or James Cameron. ""Cars 2"" is as beautiful if not more so than ""Rio"" and the writing is considerably more solid. Is it Pixar's best? Nope. It's probably Pixar's worst. But that's like saying a diamond has a few flaws in it: it's still more valuable than most of the other gems out there.

Many critics are calling the story line too confusing or complex for younger audiences, but let's be honest - all children's movies contain hidden story lines that only older audiences can fully grasp. My eight year old cousin follows it easily, in fact he even explained some of it to me. Children younger than that don't look for anything more than the obvious storyline they can see - that there are cars and they are friends and they race. Every child I have talked to has loved this film, and seeing as this is Disney's target audience, I say this film reached its goal. What's more is, if the story line was less complex, adults would have the same moan or complaint of the age-old ""same-old-same-old"" story line, the complaint of all Disney movies being the same with different characters. This film is different, and yes it has ditz and dazzle, that's what kids like. ",1

385,1.0,"I knew about the infamous Cars 2 for a while now and I have never seen it up until now. That is until today that I decided to give it a chance... boy did I underestimate how bad, out of touch and inappropriate this sequel would be.",1
386,4.0,"I did adore the first film, the second film is not that great. I mean even as a kid I never enjoyed it as much as the jets and it was low. Why I don't like it? First, it's a world of living cars. The first film was good as they fit the premise. The second doesn't as it follows spy-comedy and all. Action doesn't make a film good. Just remember that. It never did. And the plot, it the same plot in each and every spy film. But I can't say it's that horrible that it needs a Razzie. It actually deserves a mixed receptions as the good things are the action scenes and the background animation. But doesn't fit the problem alone. Owen Wilson, if you want Cars 4 to be a thriller genre, I have a story which has importance to the racing as well as the action.",1

390,7.0,"The critics may have jumped the gun on this one. Cars 2 is just as fun as most other animated movies. Not as good as the rest of Pixar's output, but at least on the level of other animated films like Rio. I found it to be highly entertaining and exciting. Mater actually makes for a good protagonist and Larry the Cable Guy is well used in this movie. This film isn't exactly well- written, but it has a strong enough emotional arc and appealing visuals to make up for it. My only serious complaint was that ""Git-R-Done"" wasn't uttered once in this film. It may not be as good as Toy Story 3, but Cars 2 is certainly not a bad movie.",1
391,5.0,"Going to see this movie in anything else than 3D is a fail waiting to happen. The worst part of the movie is the fact that its just slightly less exciting than its predecessor. The best thing about the movie, is that its a kids movie you could talk to your kids about afterward, ie ""Wasn't that 3D cool?!"" This one focuses just as much energy and time on to the superstar dump truck as it tries introducing new edgy characters. If your looking for the old crew/cast in this one, this is not the one. Too much was going on! too many location changes + with too many stories all lumped into one = attention deficit disorder brain conditioning. But multiply that with 3D, and you have a bearable movie!",0
392,1.0,"This was a terrible movie in every way. Its a PG-13 movie hidden in animation and certainly not G. We took our 4 yr old twins to this as the original Cars is their favorite movie/show. Unfortunately, everything that was great about the first movie is completely lost in this abomination. Guns, bombs, violence, death...movie is full of everything we don't want our kids exposed to at this age. Its also truly a shame that the great character buildup and friendships of the first movie are completely thrown out here. Will certainly NOT be spending another dollar in any of the ubiquitous Disney/Pixar merchandise around the movies nor lining up to see any further sequels.",0
393,8.0,"I took my 6 year old son to to see the movie in 3D the other day. Both of us had a blast, it is really nice to watch for kids and adults. I really liked the way they turn every aspect of life into a CARS friendly environment. the multiple locations used in the races are used in a very stereotypical but fun way that appeals to the child in everyone of us. The story is solid and fun. Enough for the length of the movie. Disney has been so far successful at avoiding saggy movies. Micheal Cane adds weight to the movie. his voice is as great as his acting. i couldn't have wished for a better story for the second film of the franchise.",1
394,3.0,Even as I child I didn't like it much. Why is Motor the main character and a spy all of the sudden. What happened to lighting mcqueen story arc. I just was left confused and kinda sad at the end of it.,0
395,7.0,"I like the first movie, but the storyline probably scare little kids. The first one was funny, but this has guns and is to serious.",0
396,2.0,"It's terrible, just terrible. This movie was trash. I rather watch Cars, or Cars 3. If Cars 2 was like Cars 1, I could've enjoyed it.",0
397,10.0,The hate is too much this movie was entertaining from start to end and featured many many wonderful scenes and dialog combined with James bond like moments and just was excellent. Mater was excellent including McQueen the sequence of story from mater trying to do undercover work and stop a criminal faction while his friend McQueen was trying to win the cup achieved higher expextiom than I expected as mater was left with a choice McQueen his friend or finn mcmissle (voiced by the great sir micheal Caine) and im not putting spoilers. Overall I think its worth the watch even without watching cars 1 as its a great single movie but a even better sequel thank you to john Lasseter for director such a great movie.,1
398,1.0,"Violence taking over..., again, Cars 2 simple example This could have been a nice movie if there wouldn't be this disgusting display of culture of violence. When do you start to understand that this is really showing cheap in-mature values. Like this movie Cars 2, many other 'part 2' movies showing signs of the same development: part one, mostly good entertainment with mostly an interesting story, than, when they come to part two, the display of disgusting violent scenes takes over. Cars 2 is abuse of power: Audience is expecting a family movie similar to part 1. Creating violent movies as Cars 2 is an abuse of the arrogant American film industry against normal people not only in the US but also world wide. America's Culture of Violent Movies Infect the World and Itself. Maybe it's rather dumb, naive, irresponsible, uneducated than arrogant. Cars 2 is a good example of the cheap in-mature US movies industry: Violence is greatly revered in the United States, and Cars 2 will add more to it. AmerÂ­iÂ­can violent culture is everyÂ­where, Cars 2 productions is a good example why. Violence has become associated with the AmerÂ­iÂ­can movie industry. Wake up, make better movies. Take responsibility.",0
399,,"There is a lot that could be said about this film, but the 1 thing that particularly bugged me is that the 'baddie' is German. Not just that he is German, but in the story plot about fuel that he is. I want to get this straight, I am English and have neutral feelings about Germans, I also watched this film with dutch dubbed voices. It just really grated on me that the hero is American and the baddie German - as it almost always is in an American production.",1
400,8.0,"Cars 2 is better in my opinion than Cars. There are very many reasons for this and I will explain some now. You see, the way Cars 2 began was just perfectly stating that this was a sequel and introducing the Cars experience to new viewers. Although a bit confusing at the very start, it doesn't matter because it's new info to everyone. This movie welcomes many new characters and does a very good job of keeping all of the characters from the previous movie. I believe that this movie gives you a lot of action and fantasy that it should have. Because the movie is an animation it doesn't need to be like the first Cars where there is no real fantasy. That concludes my review of Cars 2 and I am hoping for a Cars 3!",1
401,8.0,I'm 34 years old and I went to see the movie with my 2 nephews (10 and 5 years old) without knowing anything about the storyline.,1
402,,"â€Ž'Cars 2' was alright. An okay sequel to probably one of the weakest Pixar films. If you're not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy's ""Mater"", then you won't enjoy it. It's basically his film, not Lightning McQueen's. Also missed the voices of the late Paul Newman and George Carlin this time around. A good film, but strictly for the little ones (went with a free ticket, btw).",0
403,,It's enough for animation.But Mater is favorite character.He is lisp and It made him funny.Mcqueen is number one race car but he can be a mean but I like him.,1
404,8.0,This is a kids movie. My 7 yr old boy and 5 yr old girl both love the Cars movies.....and have since the first one was released. These people giving it a 2/10 or anything under 7/10 really need to get a life and stop reviewing kids movies to adult standards. A child would not sit and watch a grown-up movie then rate it 10....they complain it is boring...too much talking.<br /><br />Complaint over.,0
405,8.0,"This film, and the first one cop a lot of flack. However they are my kids favourite films, they watch them over and over. My sons are 6 and 9. This is a little kids film. It gets reviewed by adults who think it sucks, it's not for you. It's not like Wall-E. My kids hated Wall-E, there's not much in it for kids, it's too grown up, it's an adults movie.",1
406,8.0,I am still baffled at the bad reviews this is getting. My only explanation can be this: 1. People are holding Pixar movies to a higher standard than other movies. This is understandable given their stream of hits. Or 2. People were waiting for Pixar to screw up and used this as an excuse. I guess some critics take their title a bit too literally.,0
407,8.0,"I like Spy movies, like action, I like McQueen and Mator.",0
408,7.0,........THERE ARE NO SPOILERS.......THERE ARE NO SPOILERS........... CARS2 is a movie that is aimed at kids. So what purpose would my review serve? NONE. I am not going to go into how good Pixar films are. I am not going to say that they can't all be winners. The truth of the matter is this. The movie is aimed at kids and not adults. If you take your kids or grandkids to see this or any other movie and they enjoy it then that is all that matters. The people who have written negative reviews are not looking at this movie from the perspective of a child. If they like it then gosh it must be a good movie. There is action in this movie and older kids may find the story to be more interesting then the first installment. I myself did enjoy the movie. I certainly did not think it was as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe.,0
409,7.0,"This is like a spy movie made for an adult just replaced with cars. Any kids who are young but understand the concept of death might be a little frightened. Like in one scene, a car is strapped into a device with some machine that makes him explode and die. Another, a car is almost pushed into a fire. The use of guns is very common. Bathroom fights, street fights, many ending up with a cars death. So, be careful young ones! Its entertaining though.",1
410,4.0,"The movie tried to step where it didn't need to.<br /><br />First of all, yes, the society in Cars universe can and should be more explored, but I don't think that making a spy movie would be ideal for this.<br /><br />It literally doesn't have anything to do with the storyline of the first movie.<br /><br />The protagonist doesn't have any arc or personal growth during the movie.<br /><br />The plot twist was a big clichÃ©.",0
411,9.0,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie different from the first and not as good but look at other pixar movies (can anybody really say toy story 2 was better than the original) it was a different approach putting mater as the lead in my opinion didnt work as well as he is a great side kick but its still a well written, well thought out story - can easily watch it with kids and have with my 5 year old niece - dont get the hate this movie has not like the original but good in its own right",1
412,7.0,"That's the best phrase I can think of to summarise this movie. Cars 2 has many flaws, such as the complete shift in tone from the first movie, the sometimes weak dialogue and the muddled message that your friends shouldn't make any effort to change themselves for the better. Cars 2 is a disastrous sequel that strays so far from the down-to-earth and heart-warming story of Cars.",1
413,10.0,"This movie was one of the first movies i ever seen in my childhood, and it is the best movie ever!, the characters are good even the background characters, the story of this movie is incredible, the soundtrack of this movie is the best and i watch this movie every single year and it never gets old, not only this is the best pixar movie in my opinion but also the best movie ever, i belive there will never be movie like cars 2, and people who thinks cars 1 and cars 3 is better than cars 2 they don't like actual good movies and just want something repetitive every time, and cars 2 is more creative than the other movies, anyways should i reccomend you to watch it? YES! I give this movie 10/10 but if i could i would had give this movie a infinite/10.",1

416,4.0,"Pixar making a bad movie was bound to happen someday, and this was it. As a stand- alone animated film, it's just an okay to mediocre kids' movie that is really stupid. As a Disney and Pixar film, it is a huge embarrassment. The main problem with this film is that the comic relief, Mater is the main character. Comic reliefs don't work as the main focus of the film, because they're not meant to carry the film. Most of the time, they just get annoying which is the case for this film. Also, the spy plot is very shallow and awkward considering the first film had nothing to do with spies, and the environmental message is very hammered in. Overall, this film is meh in the worst way possible, because it has so many glaring problems that don't get the film into bad territory.",0
417,9.0,The plot is amazing. The action with Finn McMissile and the story driven mainly by Mater(or Martin in french)is soo differnt and puts some light on his life wich is seen as McQueen's bestfriend.,1
418,7.0,"Cars was the worst Pixar movie ever, without imagination and creativity. The plot is copied of ""Michael J Fox - Dr Hollywood"". The difference is that in one you have doctors an in the other cars. For me is boring ans slow once McQueen get lost in that forbidden town. you can't get watermelons if you seed pineapples. Pixar did their first great mistake (the first one was Bugs and the second is Cars), but this one is silly and only searching for incomes instead to continue with that way giving us mature stories as Up & Wall-E. They believe the kids are stupid, but the best sequence in Pixar movies was the story of the couple of UP. The kids really learned about life and death.",0
419,6.0,"I have two younger half brothers, each 5 and 3 and they are both die hard Cars fans. They have seen the original movie at least 100 times and even my parents have managed to pick out the little things because they've been forced to see it so many times. As a treat, I decided to take my 5 year old brother to Cars 2 (because the 3 year old really doesn't like to sit for an entire movie). I wasn't expecting it to be a super awesome sequel but awaited what was in store for me.",0
420,8.0,"There has been a lot of negative reviews for the movie, sure it is not as charming as the 1st one. But I personally think you should never compare sequels to the earlier movies. Sure they have the same characters and are in some ways continuations, but for the most of it they are different movies. If you love real cars then this movie is just super. It's cleverly funny e.g. The car Lewis Hamilton has a gap in his teeth just like the real Lewis. Besides these small smile moments there are of course funny dialogs. Watch it! its fun. And the whole spy element is quite refreshing in a Pixar movie. It may of course make you want to go and see a Bond flick.",1

WATCH IT ITS A GOOD FILM WHAT YOU NEVER SEEN BEFORE Love it. Watch it Love it Watch it Love it Watch it. Make sure your children are with big people. It A Good Film. I think all kids should watch this film because it about cars u never seen it before so that why your kids should watch this movie I took My nephew to it and love it to bits. LOVE THE FILM AND THAT WHY I GAVE IT 10/10 I never seen a film like this before i would buy this film to watch all the time cuz i got a lots of peole in my family so that means i got lots of cozzs but they cant watch rate 12 film they got to watch something like cars that y i will buy it for them when it comes out,1
423,8.0,"If you are looking for a movie to transport you back in time to when you were a kid then do not miss this summer's back to the past movie Cars 2. It is a sweet, wholesome movie that reaches out to remind us all that friendship is still a virtue to be lauded. On the surface the movie appears to be about the Grand Prix of Racing featuring Lighting McQueen and his dear friend Mata taking the audience on a whirlwind tour of Tokoyo, Italy and London as Lighting McQueen struggles to defeat his arch nemesis from Italy but this movie has an underlying message for young and old alike that being the value of a friend and of being yourself in a world that often wants you to be someone else. Cars 2 features once again that old junk tow truck Mata who has seen too many miles and too many tow trips yet still lingers on. Mata is the kid in your old neighborhood clumsy, geeky, uncoordinated and foolish, you know the kid that when you were choosing sides for your sandlot baseball game as a kid everyone took last and have him play right field. But true to form that clumsy, geeky, uncoordinated and foolish kid is a loyal, sweet, tried and true friend that you can count on when you are in a jam, Cars 2 is an action packed thriller and the 3D affects are awesome. Make Cars 2 one of your must see movies of the summer.",1
424,,"When I saw the trailers for Cars 2, I expected the movie to be average, something I could sit through and not fall asleep. A movie that I could go to with my siblings and not be bored to death. I was extremely wrong. The plot was full of twists and turns, unexpected action. I was laughing at Mater's 'pistachio ice cream' incident. It brought smiles to everyone's faces and was an unexpectedly great comedy, action and hidden romance. From the James Bond style characters to our fellow friends from Radiator Springs, it was a humorous movie that I will never forget. Its something someone would want to watch over and over again and never tire from it. This is a movie for the young and old, something a child will cherish and an adult can be nostalgic with. Pixar brings out things that would normally be in an adult film, and turns them into something a young 8 year old could easily understand. So move aside Disney and say hello to the new boss, Pixar.",1

426,,"i felt it necessary to write a review on this movie based on what i've read.... i enjoy this web site b/c people actually use it & update it. i read reviews, who it stars, what's their next movie, etc. This movie however i did not read the reviews before i watched it. loved the first one so much i had to see the 2nd. when it ended i finally stopped laughing. it was a silly over the top animated cartoon. the direction of the movie was goal orientated - to have fun. it was a pleasure to see this movie-my family & i loved it & had fun. ignore the reviews of shallow people that didn't like it. the folks that wrote a review disrespecting this animated feature clearly can make the greatest movie of all times. right?",1

What a joke. Cars 1 is a great ""G"" movie. It flows nicely. Your younger children can watch it - no problem. Cars 2 should be PG. It has a jumbled storyline with an unoriginal espionage theme, and it sells out to a higher level of violence. Skip it and watch the series-rescuing Cars 3 instead. You won't miss a thing.",0
429,10.0,"I am just going to make this quick. I really don't get how people hated this movie. Seriously, it is just as great as any other Pixar films. Sure, it does contain some violence, but those kids need to learn about these kind of stuff at some point in their life. You can't just keep them all safe and goody forever. They need to learn about violence in life. This world ain't perfect, violence occurs all the time. This is great opportunity for kids to learn. Also, before you haters of this movie post something, why not think about it? I, and many others would really appreciate if you keep your rude comments to yourself. And if you hate it so much, then why are you even here?! In conclusion, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I totally give it a 10/10. Another great job by Pixar.",1
430,,"I loved the first cars movie. I really did. Then when I checked out Apple TV, I saw that Cars 2 is coming out, it showed Lightning and Mater with spy gadgets. What? And that's exactly what I was thinking about the movie when I walked out of the theater. The story goes something like this, there's a cup that lightning goes to, (a race) then Mater becomes a secret agent for some reason. That's all I can gather. And then they meet another car, it's just a mess. So, the story is nearly nonexistent. It felt as if Pixar just wanted to cash in. Also, if you want to make a movie with an ""intricate storyline"", try to do it without making the viewers zone out.",0
431,7.0,"I'm not sure what everyone was expecting from cars 2 when it released but I'm glad it diverted from the clichÃ©d story of the first movie (which I still enjoyed). I'm not a huge fan of Mater but I quite enjoyed what they did here. As a fan of weird lemons and odd cars in real life and a bond fan, I loved all the little nods in this movie from the AMCs, ZAZ to Jaws and Blofeld. I saw the ending coming but it is a kids movie after all.",1
432,,"Cars 2 isn't a bad movie, but it was clearly more designed to sell toys than to be enjoyed at the theatre. The story was completely uninspired and at times too complex for kids. It was a tad too violent for my taste but not to the point to scare a kid or hurt the kids psyche in any way, but I get the feeling that all the explosions were there just to keep interest as the story itself wasn't enough. But what bothered me the most was the ending. Or lack thereof. From Toy Story all Pixar movies have memorable endings. Some almost make me cry every time I see them (""I wasn't aiming for the truck"" in Toy Story 1, saved by the claw in Toy Story 3, Mc Queen sacrificing his Piston Cup for an ailing King). Cars 2 simply didn't have a memorable ending by any standard. It just happened, and I'm sure in a few weeks I won't even remember what it was. A completely forgettable movie, and I think that's a definitive first for Pixar. What a shame.",0

I also had a can of baked beans on me as a movie snack, much to my second cousin's dismay. During the Toyko race scene, I spilled the beans all over my fancy Kill Bill shirt. My second cousin laughed and laughed, I was humiliated. 5/10",1
