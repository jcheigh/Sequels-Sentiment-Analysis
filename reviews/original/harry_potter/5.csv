0,8,Love and other wars,"If you don't know the book (like me), but watched the trailer before you watched the movie, you could be excused for feeling a bit cheated. The trailer actually promises something that doesn't really happen (real world). But try to free your mind of that. I was a bit confused, but it didn't really throw me off the movie."
1,6,All The Least Important Parts of the Book in Movie Form.,"This film has possibly the worst ending of any HP film, and wandered the furthest from the books. If you are a fan of the books, this is for you: "
2,7,My least favourite hp movie,"This movie focuses on the relationships too much and not the actual story. There was more of Tom Riddle's backstory in the book and in the film, they could've focused on that instead of the relationships"
3,4,The Best Book...The Worst Movie!,"As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly, I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series."
4,8,Darker and Better,"Darker than ever, Lord Voldemort has been revealed in the 'Order of the Phoenix'. The forces of darkness are gathering strength. Fear has spread throughout the wizard world. Harry Potter is now investigating Voldemort's plans through his old teacher Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent)."
5,9,The binding is really fragile  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"It's a real shame that I could never give a film featuring Harry Potter the status of a perfect film. Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words  Bruno Delbonnel."
6,9,Reaches neither the depth nor the complexity of the book but still pretty damn impressive,"HP6 is a dark and emotionally thrilling masterpiece. It combines magical awes that appeal mostly to children as well as mature and dark themes that appeal to almost everyone. It discovers the dark and mysterious past of you-know-who and leaves the audience aching for more as its two and half hours run time go by in a flash. The film contains dazzling visuals and terrific cinematography. It is indeed a satisfying experience that will please just about everyone. One thing is for certain though: in resemblance to the Rowling novels, the film series seems to get darker and more mature with every passing film while keeping an incredible PG rating (in the exception of HP4 & 5). This film not only has some bangs and booms but also explores the theme of teenage love as the three protagonists find themselves tangled in teenage romances. Overall a top notch film worth seeing over and over. Cant wait for the arrival of the Deathly Hallows."
7,7,It's Love Potions That Are Most In Demand,Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince sets a couple of milestones in the film series. Harry and sidekicks Hermione and Ron are coming a bit late into puberty which is understandable considering all the adventures they've had. But they're now starting to see what the opposite sex is all about.
8,3,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, or Ron Weasley and the Half-A**ed Romance?",Oh god.
9,5,The weakest film in the series,"This movie proves the Harry Potter world has become pretentious. The filmmakers are so concentrated on showing off their special effects, getting cool shots or displaying the sets that they forget to actually tie scenes together, tell the story and, at times, make sense. Plus, they cut out important elements of the book so they can make more room for the never-ending romantic subplot and they even add in pointless scenes that were never in the book! This is the weakest film of the series."
10,9,"So far, the best of the Harry Potter films!","I think people are forgetting that the book is a very complicated one to transcribe to screen, but the film, bearing in mind that it changed the overall structure of the book, missed some very dramatic scenes out, and characters like Rufus Scrimgeur and Rosmerta were left out entirely is definitely the best of the Harry Potter films. The climax was good, but compared to the book's climax, which was much more intense, I felt it could have had more action, and perhaps more explanation. Visually, it is a marvel to look at, especially with the Cave Scene with the dark brooding cinematography and the splendid special effects. But somehow Steve Kloves managed to not only make some genuine scares, namely when the arm of one of those grey creatures comes out the water and grabs Harry, (this made me jump violently) but there were some really funny bits. Like when a student is sick in front of Snape, Snape says ""you have just earned yourself a month's worth of detentions"", and Ron and Lavender's romance. My favourite has to be Harry and Ron's hilarious conversation about girls' skin, and when Dumbledore is seen holding a Woman's Own magazine! Not to mention, Luna's dress in one scene, what was she wearing? I am just wondering though, whether I was the only one who wept buckets at the end, sorry, seeing Harry crying over Dumbledore's body and everyone staring on helplessly, just started me off on an emotional drainage. Back to the film, the music was beautiful and very haunting as well as noticeably darker in tone to the scores by John Williams and Patrick Doyle, and there was some splendid looking scenery. The acting was excellent, Daniel Radcliffe is likable as Harry, Rupert Grint hilarious as Ron and Emma Watson giving her best performance as the character. Robbie Coltrane was good, but it is a shame he didn't get that much screen time. I never cared much for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Richard Harris was more my idea of the character, but Gambon like Watson gives his best performance (as the character that is). Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were solid as rocks in their roles as Snape and McGonagall, and Tom Felton was remarkably good as Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant as Bellatrix, nobody could play her better. But for me, the scene stealer was Jim Broadbent as Slughorn, maybe not what Rowling intended in terms of figure, but the the performance is wonderfully electric. The direction was competent, overall, the film is no masterpiece, but it is the best of the series, so I thoroughly recommend it. 9/10 Bethany Cox."
11,9,"Dark, funny, and not weighed down by too much exposition.","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - A footnote: Funny thing about Harry Potter reviews. If you peruse enough of them, you'll notice that ""lack of nit-picks"" is a substitute for praise. Everyone comes from different points of view when they go in to see these films. Some people read the books, some haven't. Everyone has their favorites, or hates the films in general. I have never experienced the films without having read the books first so I cannot comment on how hard it is to follow any of them. For some they are too long, for some not enough. I have enjoyed all of the films to varying degrees all for different reasons. David Yates continues from where he left Order of the Phoenix, arguably the weakest of the seven books but one of the stronger films."
12,7,Are you freaking kidding me!!?,"I have been counting down the days since they moved this movie from its original release date. As the characters have grown older, the story line gets better, and I was hoping the same would go for the sixth movie. However, I am still completely confused about the decisions made for this movie. The movie is two and a half hours of ridiculousness. Yes, it has fantastic effects, and humor about the raging hormones, but who cares if the integrity of the story is completely diminished. Let's make a list of everything they cut out:"
13,9,A Great HP Movie!,"This Harry Potter movie is really well done. Instead of action, this movie focuses more on the drama and romance, definitely the romance. Because there is limited action, the filmmakers had to add additional scenes which everyone say it didn't happen in the novel(True, it didn't). Also, the movie tended to be a little on the boring side."
14,1,"To say I was disappointed is an understatement, Half Blood Prince is among the weakest in the series.",SPOILERS AHEAD
15,9,Far and away the best in the series,"Harry Potter. The name alone induces screams across the world, and may make movie theater managers such as myself fall on the ground when the prints arrive in the building. Just because I did get to watch it early does not mean I didn't do my share of waiting around the theater. More than 7 hours after I got off work, I was still at the theater and ready to watch what I had been waiting for ever since the wonderful 'Order of the Phoenix' two glorious years ago. Not only was 'Half Blood Prince' my favorite book in the series, it was also one of my favorite books of all time. My expectations could not have been higher, possibly the highest for any movie I'd ever had."
16,2,A major disappointment,"As an avid reader of the HP book series, and a devout HP movie fan, the sixth installment came up short in almost every aspect of the film."
17,1,Worst Interpretation EVER,"This segment of HP will disappoint all who read the novel. The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them."
18,3,How to enjoy this movie if you're a fan of the HP Books,"Last night I had gone to the midnight showing of the movie. This morning I wrote a review (below) b/c I wanted to express how disappointed I was. However, I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love HP, afterall! I decided to try another approach, to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I'll be da*ned if it didn't work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have, that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that, and accepted that this movie is merely ""based on"" the book, I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly, the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly, I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work, but it did. So, if your a really big fan of the books and cd's, and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie, I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home, sit back, and watch! "
19,8,Mixed thoughts,"The reason I gave this an 8 is because it is truly a sensational film, the best yet out of the whole franchise. The acting is milestones ahead of what it has been in previous HP films (especially from Emma Watson), the storyline and characters are much more layered and 3D, the sets and special effects are breathtaking, and the score is absolutely gorgeous. As a stand-alone film, I would happily give this a 10."
20,,Powerful and stunning! One of the best fantasy films ever made,"I have always been a big fan of Harry Potter, both the books and the films. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite of the first 6 books, and now I can say that the film is as well. First off, the film does cut a lot of things out. It cuts some of the Horcruxes that are talked about, and some of the memories of Tom Riddle, but even without them, this is an incredibly powerful film. The opening sequence I loved and I was glad that the writers would include such a scene. It shows the danger of the world that everyone lives in now that Voldemort is back. David Yates is back directing the 6th film after the fantastic Order of the Phoenix, which I thought he created a much more moodier and grittier Harry Potter adaptation. In Half-Blood Prince, Yates directs with much larger confidence and maturity, one that is shown much throughout the film. This Potter film is the first to actually make me smile and laugh along with it. It has a lot of whimsical, light and genuinely funny moments, which I thought were brilliant and stayed true to the book. When the film requires it to, it gets darker and more menacing, which I also thought was balanced very nicely with the tone of the book. I like judging the Harry Poter films more as films, not always as adaptations. There will always be some people who are disappointed, but I am grateful for the things that were in the film, that they were well-made and stayed true to what I imagined while reading the book. This film succeeds in that. Steve Kloves is a very talented writer, to cut all those things out of the book but for it to stay with that same tone that J.K. Rowling marks on them."
21,9,An engaging set-up for the final episodes,"Java Man Reviews ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com July, 2009."
22,8,"As a movie it's the most well crafted of the series. But as an adaptation of the book, it was by far the worst.","Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it's ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it's just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn't detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered."
23,6,"Very anti-climatic, very disappointing.","I'll keep this short and bittersweet. While not without its merits, the sixth film in the HP series was very much a let-down for me."
24,5,"Great cinematography, consistency weak","My favorite part of the novel Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince, which was probably my favorite novel in the series, was all of the subplots. We had the drama behind the Minister Magic and relations with the Muggle government. We had the quite humorous interactions between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family - really quite crucial to the seventh book - and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change, which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta. And we had so much in the end - Harry being trapped under the Invisibility Cloak during Dumbledore's death, an entire battle at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore's elaborate and meaningful funeral."
25,1,Horribly Awful Garbage,"Once again, I dutifully took my wife to see the latest installment of the Harry Potter series. I was completely bored and actually thought about suicide. The acting was so amateurish it makes a 1940's matinée serial like Flash Gordon seem like Citizen Kane. Nothing happened in this boring bore of a film. Things seemed to liven up every 45 minutes or so when a Gothic looking girl dressed in black cackled as she burned something to the ground. After a minute, she disappeared and you were back to the boring premise of weird looking teens having a crush on one another. This film was utterly stupid, poorly acted, and excruciatingly boring. Captive terrorists at Guantanimo Bay should be forced to watch this film repeatedly until they reveal where Osama Bin Laden is hiding."
26,8,one more step to go,"Continuing the series' darker slant as it progresses, the current movie does a good job revealing more about the characters. The new character is Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), who knows a secret about Tom Riddle, before the latter became Lord Voldemort."
27,,Space Opera,Over on FilmsFolding there is a discussion on architecture in film and luckily enough this comes along as a great example of space used intensively and to support the definition of world and some narrative elements. It isn't art. It breaks no new ground and the elements of the story are insipid. But it is space.
28,6,"""Half-Blood Prince"" Is a Half-Assed Movie","I've enjoyed watching the Harry Potter films (I've not read the books), but this is the first one that began to try my patience."
29,9,Immensely satisfying for fans who can see the movie behind the book,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. "
30,7,The Half-Blood Prince,"Ah, the sixth installment into the Harry Potter franchise, the Harry Potter series has sort of become the new contender for the biggest geek following since Star Wars, although Lord of the Rings is pretty darn close as well, lol. But honestly, even though I haven't read the books, I do enjoy the movies, they're pretty fun. So when I saw the trailer for The Half Blood Prince, I was really excited because this looked so much more darker than the previous movies. As we grow up, so does Harry, he's going through major changes in his life and most of his readers/audience are experiencing similar things with him when it comes to love and confusion on what their lives are about. But is the series getting a little too dark? It seemed like this was the story that focused more on the romance of the students vs. the magic and the dark world they are facing. Speaking of which, there is blood in this movie, not to mention some pretty frightening moments that may have made this Harry Potter movie a bit more hard to accept."
31,7,A Return to Form,"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously ""This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past."
32,8,"Very dark, but very good","It's a wonderful experience to grow up alongside the child actors of the films, and even though I know I still would have enjoyed them had I been born earlier or later, I'm always glad I was the perfect age to watch each movie when it came out in the theaters. It was always a Thanksgiving tradition in my family, preceded by a month or two of my dad reading the corresponding book aloud to us, no matter how old we grew. So, even though this volume is quite violent, and there are a couple of scenes during which I have to look away, there's still a lot to love about the very dark sixth film."
33,1,Half Blood Prince is the most disappointing film of the summer and the worst Harry Potter film so far..,"I consider myself a Harry Potter fan. Not of the movies, but from the books which they came from. There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world, it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books."
34,8,"Perhaps the most unconventional 'Potter', it places almost all the emphasis on school-life espionage and is entertaining because of it.","'Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince (2009)' manages to keep the focus mostly on Hogwarts, giving Harry a mission to accomplish whilst also dedicating significant time to his friends and their teenage troubles. It also always delivers on the promise of an unseen threat looming close by. Indeed, it's perhaps the darkest in the series so far. This bleak tone is bolstered by a ballsy ending that provides little in the way of levity or triumph. The film balances this darkness with some lighter moments peppered throughout, which satisfy without overdoing it. The flick is perhaps the most unconventional of the bunch, taking things back to basics with school-life front and centre. It also has distinct, vaguely dream-like cinematography. Its somewhat left-field approach certainly pays off, though. The end result is a unique, wistful and entertaining experience that acts as a nice counter-point to the two films that follow. 8/10"
35,9,Felt Like Harry Potter Again,This one felt more like one of the first Harry Potter films but much darker to me.<br /><br />We have plentiful of classroom scenes going on in between all the action and adventure. There is a surprise twist ending.
36,5,Harry Ponderous,"I'm a little behind with the film series having finished reading the Potter novels a couple of years ago so that the narrative wasn't as fresh in my mind as when I viewed the earlier instalments. This is a good thing as it meant I wasn't so critical about how closely the film adhered to the book and could give the film a chance to stand on its own merits. Oddly, while remember enjoying the book a lot, I found the movie somewhat slow and devoid of action."
37,5,Narratively flawed adaptation of the best book of the series,"Defiantly avoiding the familiar sign-posts of the early Harry Potter movies (Harry's troubles with the Dursley's, the journey to Hogwarts, meeting the new Defence Against the Dark Arts), returning director David Yates and the franchise in general has firmly settled into it's dark, brooding persona. The trouble is, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his ever- present shadows Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have developed into one-dimensional bores. Thankfully, The Half-Blood Prince is rich in snivelling villains and wise old wizards and witches, all portrayed by an embarrassingly rich line-up of British thesps, who liven up the proceedings somewhat and add that much-needed gravitas."
38,8,Great film but key plots from the book missing,Like all Harry Potter fans I have read all of the books and seen every film so far. I would have to say that this film is not my favourite so far and leaves you feeling that some vital parts of the book are missing. However this is worth watching and I feel this will only disappoint the most hardcore Harry fans! 
39,4,"The worst entry yet. A ""filler"" and waste of time.",Spoilers abound below.
40,5,The Worst Harry Potter Film,"Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) summons Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) in his vacation and they visit Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to convince him to return from his retirement to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft to give Potions Classes. Dumbledore is teaching Harry Potter about Tom Riddle a.k.a. Voldemort, and he uses the memories of Slughorn to understand the evil Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry Potter finds a book that belonged to a mysterious Half-Blood Prince that he uses in Slughorn's classes. Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) protects the evil Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) due to an oath while Draco releases the Death Eaters to bring chaos and destruction to the world."
41,1,"Harry Potter and the... Eh, Just Don't Even.","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was horrible. Don't get me wrong: The acting was great, the score was amazing, the scenery beautiful... The only thing wrong? The plot. They absolutely BUTCHERED the book--and while I (and millions of others) agree that YES, they cannot fit everything from the book into the movie, I (also like many others) do say that there were some HUGE plot points that they skipped and they took trivial, two-sentence moments from the book and made THOSE into the main parts of the movie. Oh, and let's not forget how much they added! But I'll just list it out for you:"
42,6,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince flat out sucks! It has very little redeeming factors to it, its too long and its boring. I will never understand how the filmmakers turned what was actually an okay book into a film this boring. I read the Half-Blood Prince book, and I actually liked it. I liked the dark turn the books had taken (before f*****g it up with the Deathly Hallows), and the death of Dumbledore was actually dramatic and actually elicited an emotional response from me. It wasn't a great book, I felt that the plot delved a bit too deep into the relationships amongst the characters (or was that the Order of the Phoenix? Either way it slowed things down), and I also didn't really find the book that exciting until the ending, that is where things got good. The movie, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. Things did not get good towards the end, if anything, it got worse! The Half-Blood Prince is what happens when a book that had so much background to it that when turned into a film, the filmmakers need to keep things moving while still telling a good story and have it exciting. This movie didn't do that at all. It was boring, from beginning to end, nothing but boring, dreadfully slow scenes that nearly put me to sleep. Not only that, but the many scenes regarding the relationships were so bad that I didn't feel that the characters didn't actually like each other, the only reason they do is because the plot requires them too. For example: Ginny Weasley is supposedly going to be Harry Potter's girlfriend, but her character is so bland and the actress didn't really do a good enough job to make it look like she actually did like Harry. She stares at him with an uninterested look in her eyes, one that says to me, ""Why does the script require me to fall for this guy?"" Its painful to watch, and only serves to kill 5 minutes."
43,10,"Funny, Exciting, Scary, THIS is what more summer blockbusters should be like","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Most everything about the movie is different--the characters have definitely matured, Hooper's score is better (thank goodness), the special effects have improved, and even the castle itself has a different feel to it...cold and covered in shadows. It's a refreshing touch, though. The series NEEDS constant change, or else it would become quite stale..."
44,,Benefits again from an increasingly dark and quite scary tone that makes the slightly over-long narrative more engaging,"I'm not entirely sure why the total Potter narrative has yet to really grab me and make me look forward to the next film, but I must admit that with each film the series is getting better and this film is no exception. Although it takes far too long to tell the story, Half-Blood Prince sees Harry return to Hogwarts to work with Dumbledore to try and uncover more about the dark Lord Volemort's past in order to learn of any weakness that may help him defeat him. Never having read the books at all I'm not sure if this loses a lot of the original story (I'm guessing it does) but for me the story did feel very condensed and simple at time. That said it does have a lot in the way of ""big picture"" battles as well as the hormone-inspired confusion associated with teenagers of that age."
45,1,What Happens When You Write Yourself Into A Corner!,"I found Half-Blood to be very depressing and even worse, so predictable! There is no greater sin in writing a story, except being boring! The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. "
46,3,3 hours of soap opera,"I went into this movie with almost no prejudice. I hadn't watched trailers, hadn't read reviews, hadn't talked to anyone who had seen it. And I really wanted to like the movie. After all, I still remembered how excited the previous movie had left me and the sixth book is perhaps the best of the entire series."
47,6,Hormones over excitement as part six is merely an appetiser to the double billed closure to come.,Death Eaters are running amok as Dumbledore has an important task for Harry and Voldermort has one for Draco; all set to the backdrop of raging adolescent hormones. While Harry also acquires a rather helpful book written by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.
48,10,Oh harry,Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better
49,8,Lots of not very much happens in drab colours,"This movie was, I think, one for those who are in for the long haul. As a stand-alone movie it would make little sense to anyone not familiar with the story so far. It does not move the main narrative on very much. In fact, its two and a half hours are devoted to three things - one, developing the increasing romantic interactions among the teenage principals, two, setting up the mechanism which carries the bulk of the final book ie. Voldemort's potential downfall, and three, its shock denouement."
50,1,Very very frustrating,"Boy, what a terrible disappointment. We all waited SO long for this installment to come out only to be completely crushed by the end result."
51,9,The best visual craftsmanship of a Potter installment yet,"Like every movie thus far in the Harry Potter series based on J.K Rowling's novels, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (book no. 6) cuts a lot of corners. Those who regard Rowling's tome as a bible are sure to have complaints at scenes added (the attack on the Weasley's burrow) and scenes taken away (the battle in Hogwarts), but as a film -- not a book -- second-time director David Yates and longtime Potter adapter Steve Kloves have made the most visually purposeful, emotional and character-driven Potter movie so far."
52,2,Harry Potter becomes an immature teen movie!,"The movies starts out with Harry visiting the Weasley's, where he's attacked by Death eaters. They play around with some fire and some bad special effects, burn the house and runs away. Probably the best scene in the film. The next 2 hours, the film focuses 100% on Potter wanting the Weasley girl, but she's dating someone else, and Granger wanting Ron Weasley, but he's dating a weirdo, and everybody starts hating each other cause they all love each other. I do not know how it's possible to destroy the entire concept of Harry Potter and the magic world and having it made in to a teen movie where the people who're in love with each other can't say it cause they're too immature, but they succeeded doing it! I sat there for hours, wishing for the movie to end so I could do something less stupid with my time."
53,10,A reasonably faith adaptation Blockbuster that meets expectations. There is a good chance Mr. Harry will meet Mr. Oscar.,"This has got to be one of the best in the series. David Yates does an unbelievably great job of bringing this story to the silver screen. And he brings with a faithfulness to the book plus including Ron's story of overcoming self doubt in the Quidditch match that was left out of Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix. In fact, Quidditch match in the light snow shower is one of the better ones in the series. Director David Yates gives us a darker more realistic world of Hogwarts while filming it in a way we have not seen the castle before. The cinematography is gorgeous in this film. But the best part is the script. Knowles and Yates distills the story down to it's major plot points and throws out all that was unnecessary in the book. He hits every single major plot point in the story. He doesn't miss a beat. What he couldn't film or changed for dramatic purposes, he replaced with thoroughly satisfying substitutions that carried the same message in the book. Like for instance, instead of telling us that Deatheaters are attacking Muggles and kidnapping people, he shows it to us. He takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride to an ending that packs a stunning emotional punch. As the wands rise to defeat the darkness with light. He also packs a couple of good scares in the cave scene as a monster drags Harry into the water. My only problem with the story is that it drags a little in small parts, It doesn't fully explain the meaning of the term ""Half Blood Prince"" and doesn't properly set up the love potion poisoned box of chocolates intended for Harry that Ron eats. But truly, the story doesn't slow down as much as the trolls have been claiming. So don't listen to them. It fairly and evenly well paced."
54,6,"Good execution, but bloated","David Yates returns as director and delivers a masterfully crafted and suspenseful entry to the series. It's an important and devastating milestone in Harry's journey, but the distraction of Ron and Hermione's turbulent relationship holds this movie back."
55,1,the darkest book in the series turned into a romcom...,"I know a movie is hardly as good as the book, but come on... HP 4 was a great movie, and so were the others. This lacks of plot (well, the book's, for it has Ron's romantic life as one) and of details: Dumbledore's chat about horcruxes and possible ones. Ginny and Harry's REAL kiss. Fleur and the wedding, very important in the next. the OTHER minister. Fenrir Grayback Tonk's patronus and explanation the funeral"
56,6,"Dumbledore: ""We're dealing with very dark stuff here...""","And that quote very neatly sums up the entire movie, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. And it's not the boy Wizard and his friends who carry the film on their shoulders. It's three great British actors who do more with their roles than the script ever manages to suggest: namely--JIM BROADBENT, with his hilarious quizzical expression as Professor Slughorn, ALAN RICKMAN as Snapes, seething with intensity no matter how trite his lines are, and MICHAEL GAMBON as Dumbledore, urging Harry to fight the evil forces engulfing Hogwarts."
57,4,Too much talk and not enough action makes for the weakest of the Potter films. Its all set up for the final battle and best seen on cable TV,I'm rapid becoming less of a fan of the HArry Potter series. The first film was the book on screen much to the detriment of the film. The second one improved on the first but could have used some chopping. The third film is one of the best fantasies ever put on screen. The fourth film suffers because it too compressed the book. While the last one collapsed into nonsense.
58,2,what the $^%#% was that??,"I agree with several others.... Did the director even READ the book? Does he know what a book is?? Look, Hollywood, you take a great book and make a film out of it for one reason alone: you want fans of the book to come see their favorite story come to life."
59,1,David Yates - a man responsible for single-handedly ruining Harry Potter.,"David Yates has had at his disposal for this film a gargantuan budget, a selection of fine British actors, an amazing story to work with, and some of the best and most inspired technicians and creative minds working in film today. How then he has managed to produce 'this' defies belief."
60,4,Fan of Books? Talk about upset! Fresh fan?...it was cool,"Since I consider myself a dedicated Harry Potter fan, I am going to try to put this as nicely as possible..."
61,2,Absolute Rubbish! They changed several parts from the actual book! Disappointing!,"I have purchased all the Harry Potter movies thus far; however, this one I will not bother to purchase. It is not worthy of my collection. Harry Potter followers waited a long time for this particular movie. We all know that there was trouble with production, as well as fatalities, and this is what we get for our wait?! Absolute Rubbish!"
62,1,Fans need be disappointed,"There's less of magic and tricks in the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series, fans need be disappointed -- it offers a heavy dose of drama, romance and humour rather than the plot. "
63,1,My Favourite HP Novel Turns Into My Worst HP Film,"Does everyone remember the novel of Half Blood Prince? That was a masterpiece. That had some of the best moments in the entire saga. There were memorable scenes in that novel. HBP Novel was my favourite of the series, so I was so looking forward to the movie."
64,9,Into the Pensieve,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince might just be one of the better Harry Potter films released thus far. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves took the novel and translated the spirit and integrity of the story into moving images. Like the book it is more of a character piece than an adventure film, but the greater emphasis on character makes the emotional climax have a greater deal of resonance."
65,1,Waste of time,"After the 4th and 5th movies, my expectations really weren't very high, but even low ones were disappointed with this movie. I mean, I do understand having to cut out some parts of a book to make a movie fit within an time frame, but come on, blowing up the burrow for dramatic effect? Sadly this is the direction that more and more movies are taking. I know they have announced that the 7th movie will be in two parts, and I hope to God for the director's sake, that he follows the book line by line because this 6th movie was nothing but an abortion of the book. It was nothing less than two hours of wasted life and cut corners. Please do us a favor and read the 7th book a few times before you put out the final story boards for the 7th movie."
66,2,So Boring!,David Yates outdid the boredom of his Order of Phoenix with this Half Blood Prince.
67,8,From Huge fan of the books with positive and negative thoughts on the movies,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I've always felt that Daniel Radcliff does a great job playing Harry. He has very expressive eyes and as Harry is a character who internalizes a lot, that is a great thing. I think I'll start out with my gripes and end with the praises. The two major gripes I've had with the entire series are the way that Kloves throws in many elements from the books, but never explains their significance (like all the clues in PoA-the map, Crookshanks chasing Scabbers, the shrieking shack, the ""grim"", etc but never explaining how they all tied into the truth of Sirius), or putting Rita Skeeter into the GoF movies but never explaining that she was an beetle. Throwing in so many elements without explaining their significance has made the films feel rushed and confusing. The other gripe I've had is that I've often felt that the filmmakers try to imitate similar situations they've seen in movies (particularly particularly teenage issues) rather than seeing the deeper meaning in the source material. Emma Watson seems to overact quite a bit and the filmmakers praise her for it. I often feel like she is imitating someone else rather than reacting to the situation in any given scene. One example that comes to mind in this film was her laughing at the joke about Dumbledore's age. She laughed more than the moment called for. The filmmakers also misinterpret Harry and Hermione's friendship and give the shaft to how close Harry is to Ron. The final scene of this film is a prime example. They have Harry and Hermione having a very intimate discussion while Ron is just sitting off to the side. I wonder if Kloves even likes Ron because often Ron just sits there; in the books Ron is a very active character who has certainly had a few arguments with his two best friends, but is fiercely loyal to them. I didn't like the scene where Hermione was crying over R&L; she talks to Harry about his feeling for Ginny and hers for Ron. They have never had a discussion like that in the book. Harry always trusted Ron and Hermione with his life and would have gladly sacrificed himself to save them, but he felt uncomfortable talking to them about more personal issues. He related better to Ginny, Neville and Luna on the issues because they had gone through dark times in their lives he could relate. I feel the filmmakers miss foreshadowing opportunities. They missed the ministry turning on Harry and Dumbledore by only touching on Fudge's attitude in GoF, they didn't put in the chocolate and the scene where Ginny reminds Harry about the fact that she was possessed by Riddle in OotP (which would have been a good set up for the romance in HBP, and they did not mention Dumbledore's Army, the diadem in the RoR or Hufflepuff's cup to set up the student rebellion or the hunt for Horcrux's in the final film. I wish they could hire Peter Jackson to adapt the fantasy aspects and Richard Curtis to adapt the relationships. The over doing the close friendship of Harry and Hermione while shoving Ron off to the side feels like the filmmakers pandering to what they think an audience would like rather that trusting the source materials loved by millions around the world. It's like the crappy romance between Susan and Caspian. About the infamous attack on the Burrow: it could either be an attempt at gratuitous excitement or be there to foreshadow something in the final film. If it was there for the first reason, than it is pointless and idiotic of Kloves and Yates; it had nothing to do with the rest of the film and the time the scene took could have been filled with a number of great scenes in the book. If it was there to foreshadow the final showdown between Bellatrix and Molly Weasley, it was potentially genius. They focused a lot on Molly's reaction to the burning house. Now, on to the things I liked. For the most part, I think the acting was terrific. Daniel Radcliff is really growing as an actor and I think he will have a long and successful film career once the Harry Potter films are complete. I thought he did a great job showing his fear that Ron would die in the poison scene. I also got a chuckle when he came from hiding the book in the RoR and kissing Ginny and Ron asking him if he and Ginny had done it. I also see Rupert Grint having a long career. He has great comic timing. I was laughing hard when he was under the influence of love potion. Both Daniel and Rupert have priceless facial expressions. Evanna Lynch is terrific playing Luna. Her delivery is awesome ""I often sleepwalk in this hallway that's why I wear my shoes to bed."" Classic!!!. Bonnie Wright is doing well capturing the feisty Ginny. Despite the fact that the Harry/Ginny first kiss wasn't as exciting as it was in the book, I was impressed with the kiss itself. I also enjoyed the Ron/Lavender moments more than I thought I would. They were very entertaining. I say fire Emma Watson and her bulging eyes, over active eyebrows and over acting and do some make-up on Cave and have her play Hermione. Lavender is a silly Character in her relationship with Ron. Cave could have easily overdone it and been extremely annoying, but she captured the character perfectly and I was entertained by her performance. I also have to compliment Gambon and the improvement in his portrayal of Dumbledore this time. I thought he was terrible in the previous films, but this time he seemed to capture the demeanor of the Dumbledore in this film. There were a lot of good moments and performances in this film, I just think the filmmakers need to tie everything together better."
68,9,My favorite Potter movie (coming from an avid fan),"Let me start off by saying, I am a huge HP fan. I have read the books countless times, am a daily visitor on MuggleNet, and have subscribed to Mugglecast for four years. The books are definitely where it's at, and the movies are so-so. I can still remember storming out of the theatre after OOTP two years ago, yelling the whole way home about how David Yates screwed everything up and how awful of a movie it was altogether, story line and directing style. However, the Half-Blood Prince surpassed each of the last 5 movies greatly in almost aspect. "
69,2,Harry Potter and the half-assed attempt at a movie,"This is a good movie... if you haven't read any of the books. While visually, the effects were great, they were about ALL that carried the movie. In fact, there was very little of the original storyline from the book."
70,6,Half-Wit Prince.,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent: Sixth installment regards the straddling of good and evil as wizard Dumbledore sets forth preparing Harry for his future showdown with the evil lord Voldemont. Directed by David Yates who returns after directing the impressive Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Some viewers may not care for the cliffhanger ending but special effects are inventive and imaginative as expected. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry is being schooled for an independent showdown with evil. Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione battle emotional feelings although their romantic subplot seems flimsy and unfocused here particularly when a love potion comes into play. Michael Gambon returns as the wise wizard Dumbledore who prepares Harry for the showdown that has been nearing ever closer. Jim Broadbent makes a nifty introduction as a new recruit sought after by Dumbledore. It may disappoint some viewers that one major character will be dismissed through tragedy and it may seem too cliché for those not familiar with the J.K. Rowling books. At any rate this is still pointless fun but not for young children. Parental discernment advised before children view any of these films otherwise Potter fans will get lost in its glorious images. Score: 6 / 10"
71,4,Harry Potter and the Half-Done Movie,"Let me start by saying, I know that you have to alter and omit scenes from a novel when adapting it to the silver screen. However, it is not necessary to take a chain saw to what can easily be debated as the best book in the series. Half-Blood Prince is key to setting up the final, now two, movies and this version missed the mark. Now the major novel plot points are there, Harry learns about Voldemort's past, Draco struggles with his chosen task and Snape does kill Dumbledore but much of the set-up plot and subplots have been completely omitted. For fans out there that have read the book will get a strange feeling in their gut just a few minutes in."
72,1,Avada Kadavra!,"The last episode of the Harry Potter's saga confirms the unwritten rule that in the magical battle between Good and Evil only the odd numbers of the series are good. Now, being Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the number six, fears of its not standing with the right side were high, but the result proved so unflinching in its loyalties to the bad ones to even lead them as the worst HP movie ever. True, the entire production is increasingly burdened by the fact that as time goes by not all the children chosen at the beginning have matured into good actors, nor have their features blossomed into a face the camera is in love with - see Rupert Grint for reference. Many of these shortcomings could have been overcome by virtue of good screenplay and direction, but this is where the movie's own outstanding demerits begin. Neither David Yates - director - nor Steve Kleves - writer - seem to know the formula to produce on screen such magic essentials as lightness, surprise, eeriness, danger, that feeling of scary ease wherein lives the charming freshness of Rowling's creation. The outlook is as if Albus Dumbledore had taken hold of the story at the start and then dragged ceremoniously arm-in-arm with it straight to the end: everything is so slowly-paced and unwinds so evenly that well before the first hour has passed you have no curiosity left for any waiting twist ahead. To shake some dust from the awkward predictability of a plot they have curtailed down to an archive research into Voldemort's past, writer and director deemed necessary to lag whenever possible on Ron's love labours, and here again everything is so heavily handed and contrived - juvenile spirits reduced to an overlong sorry joke - that one is led to envy those who never knew love. But the gravest flaw of the movie - a real gaping hole - is the way it depicts the development of Harry's character. It is as if the authors' own incapability in dealing with magic - which led them to substantially drop it - have awaken some hidden distrust in occult arts lying at the core of the saga, revealing a worrying obsession for safety: knowledge is dangerous and ought to be kept under control, and those who dare to know what is forbidden must be rejected and fought. Stripped of all magic such suddenly seems to have always been Hogwarts ground mantra, and you realize that in the name of security the only diversity allowed by the institution is goofiness. One of the poisoned fruits of this supposedly concealed school mission is that Harry is encouraged to grow into a cop: Dumbledore himself invites him to spy on his teachers. And we are saddened by the view of a young wizard renouncing his risky talents to hide behind walls to listen unseen to conversations, sneaking, creeping and peeping instead of bravely confronting his enemies with his wand. For an affectionate viewer this is the most perplexing plot revelation possible, and as Good and Evil begin to exchange fields in the disastrous twilight, one welcomes Snipe's nerve with some relief: the sage is gone. Good."
73,5,I know what is wrong with this movie...WHERE'S THE LOVE?,"I know what is wrong with this movie and it is such a simple thing. The whole basis of the Harry Potter universe is the importance of love. Dumbledore tell us this all the time and it is not until Harry can understand the kind of love he is talking about —self-sacrificial, unequivocal, passionate devotion to others—that Harry can eliminate Voldemort and save the wizarding community."
74,1,two thumbs down,"i thought i went to see harry potter and the half blood prince but the whole time i was wondering what book it was based off of be there weren't many similarities. more like the writers got lazy and only read the cliff notes. how did jk rowling allow this crap. i mean ginny did not hide the book...that will mess up movie seven. and why is there not an epic fight scene. that is the biggest part of the book. and where is harry's invisibility cloak? i don't expect the movie to include everything in the book, but i do expect it not to add things that aren't needed (the scene at the burrow) and leave out key points. or change how scenes were. why couldn't they show harry and ginny kissing in the common room? and at the first of the movie ginny was dating someone else...it never tells that they break up then she is kissing harry. umm...wtf."
75,1,Harry Potter and the Half-Baked Movie,"Before I begin, I will say now that I've never so much as picked up a Harry Potter book. So all I have to go on is the content of the film; I have no idea what should or should not be in there. However, I've seen the size of the book, and I'm pretty sure there's more in it than this film conveys."
76,9,"Great. Just, great.","By far, the best HP movie yet. It was dramatic, witty, and intense. I was so pleased with it. It was also VERY dark, much darker than the rest. A lot of negative things happened and kept building up, to make it a great plot. The only funny part was when Katie had that seizure thing and Ron was on that love potion. :D I just didn't get how Harry just liked Ginny (sp). I mean, I may have missed something but for me it was just like he started liking her out of nowhere."
77,7,Didn't care how TOM RIDDLE turned into VOLDEMORT but cared how HARRY POTTER turned into adult,"******THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****** A great Opening scene and i held my breath because i knew this was gonna be the best.. Yeah like many says HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE is the best book in potter series. We read it, imagined it, cried,laughed, got thrilled n etc. But this could be great adaption turned into a joke. Yeah a joke. The genre of this movie should be a ROMANTIC COMEDY because it hardly focused on the soul of the book. Apart of burning the burrow to create a fake ectasy, they would have been focusing on at least adding a single 2-3 minute memory of Voldemort's but sorry potter fans, they wouldn't.. Coz they was trying to create a ROMANTIC COMEDY.."
78,3,Dull dull dull,"This could have been superb. The book was by far the best of the series, but yet again David Yates has somehow contrived to rip the soul out of the story just as he did with Order of the Phoenix."
79,7,My favourite Potter film,"This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film."
80,2,Weakest Harry Potter Ever!,"This movie is all wrong. It is really a shame. I suspect Steve Kloves must have been drunk or just plain bored with writing another Harry Potter script. I just cant seem to explain how he left out everything good about the script. Remember, he adapted Goblet of fire which was quite good. Whats left is a detached, muddled, boring representation of the book. The movie has none of the excitement, romance, suspense.....to put it plainly, the movie is a terrible waste."
81,,Harry Potter and the Particularly Pathetic Plot...?,"I am going to have to agree with the review stated by Mr Todd above, and for almost all the same reasons...? The battle for Hogwarts was lame, no battle at all. The 'discovery' of just who exactly was the Half-Blood Prince was left out and distilled to a single line at the end in the non-existent battle. The memories from the pensieve were distilled to almost nothing. The memories of Lily and James Potter along with Snape and their time at Hogwarts were left out. The entire memory of Tom Riddles past was left out. Kreature and Dobby were entirely absent."
82,8,Good movie from the most annoying of the Potter books,"I always had something about the passivity that was glorified in the Harry Potter books. The boy would have his heart and courage and goodness, but at every single important point of his life, the outcome would be determined by others or by pure luck. This before last part of the Harry Potter story is the most annoying of all for this very reason. At no point in this part did Harry Potter do anything of consequence, all his choices were bad, if any, and in the end the story is left hanging in expectation of the grand finale of the series."
83,9,One of the Summer's Best Blockbuster's,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the Harry Potter series, and it is the greatest one yet. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince mixes comedy, romance, drama, and adventure into one, and makes it so marvelous and fun to watch."
84,2,Do We Half to Watch This?,"""Are we back?"" Marty asks. ""We're back."" Doc Brown confirms."
85,9,A Delicious Summer Treat,"Only the most unyielding literalist Potter fans will not enjoy this film as it has it all: exquisite cinematography, a brilliant soundtrack, imaginative direction, and the best acting from both veterans and young guns we've seen so far in the series. All are put to brilliant use as Dumbledore and Harry conspire to discover Lord Voldermort's secrets whilst simultaneously straining every sinew to contain outbreaks of rampant hormones and potion-taking at Hogwarts. "
86,7,"""Harry Potter"" isn't ""David Copperfield"" and J.K. Rowling isn't Charles Dickens","""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009), directed by David Yates, is this Summer's blockbuster movie. I think that this means that the series has taken on a life of its own, and that people who've seen the earlier films will go to the next ones whatever the film quality may be."
87,3,Worst one yet.,I saw the movie last night. I have ONE BIG QUESTION: HOW ON EARTH DID JK ROWLING ALLOW THEM TO DO THIS!!!?????
88,5,"I'm a HUGE HP fan, but...","*Multitudes of Spoilers within* I am huge on Harry Potter....I would spend hours before Deathly Hallows defending Snape and analyzing everything. I loved book 6 immensely, but this movie was not well done. I was so disappointed, after having waited with everyone else for over a year for this and it didn't deliver."
89,10,The perfect Harry Potter movie to date,"This is by far the best of the six. The acting is great, the CGI is just as good as Transformers, and there's much more to it. The film's also emotional, but nothing is overdone, everything is perfect. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was one of the greatest things about the movie. The romance was very good, better movie than Twilight. The story and choreography and music is great. Quidditch is a very exciting scene in the movie, and is perfectly shown, 100x better than the previous movies. The frightening scenes are going to give you goosebumps also, and the memories shown are perfectly shown. Also the cave scene at the end is very well done."
90,3,OMG......Worst HP movie ever,"OK....As a big Harry Potter fan i waited for the movie....scheduled to release in November, i was disappointed to see the movie release delayed for 6 months. i waited and waited and then the day it was released in India, i went to see it. I had high anticipations from the movie after seeing its trailers which were really looking good. Even after the poor attempt of David Yates at the fifth part, i was hopeful that he would do justice to the best book in the Harry Potter series but i was wrong!!!! First the good points of the movie. The special effects and the visuals were really stunning and high quality. Dan and others acted really well and it was nice to see Ginny having a meaty role in the movie. She looks gorgeous. The Scenes at Lake were really upto the mark. We had some nice comic moments well enacted by Dan and Rupert. But let me ask...is that the reason one goes to see a Harry Potter movie?? I didn't go to see a teenage romantic comedy. The tagline of the movie says that Harry and Dumbledore try to unravel Voldemort's past and the time we actually get to see his past in only 10 minutes in a damn 2:30 hours movie!!!! The durseleys were totally left out. So were Bill and Fleur. Hagrid got only two scenes in the whole movie."
91,6,The focus is on the fluff.,This is the review of my favorite book of the Harry Potter series and unfortunately the weakest movie of the series to date.
92,2,Just very disappointed,"I am a die hard HP fan. I was reading the first book before it even became the world wide sensation it has become. I loved all the books. I even liked how most of the movies were adapted, I've got them all on DVD. However, HBP truly did disappoint me. My husband and son(who have not read the books, my son is just starting the 2nd one) were totally bored with the movie. They have seen all the previous HP's. This one left them totally confused. It jumped around too much and too many important details were left out. They spent too much time on the romance part (and they didn't totally explain that either.) They left out key parts in the story. I'm going to have to go back and re-read the book again, because some things just didn't make sense."
93,1,"Awful, Disgusting, A complete nightmare","i saw this movie today and i was compelled to write a comment. SFX and publicity gimmicks don't make a great film and anybody who are going gaga over this movies are pathetic losers. this is probably the weakest harry potter movie of all time. i expected the film to be bad, as the story was far more complicated than the previous ones, and the scripting crew did a disappointing job on the fourth and the fifth installments, but at least it could have been made better had the director had vision. i don't know why they are continuing with David Yates. by far azkaban was the best potter movie, and will be the best of the franchisee. if one rates the book as 10 on 10 then this movie should be rated 0.01 on 10. from the very first scene it was boring and the most pathetic was the dumbledore's death scene. it was rubbish. for many parts of the film lacked detailing and if anyone who hasn't read the book would end up guessing as to why things were happening. if this is the case then i guess what will happen to the final film!! please WB change the director and bring back Curaeon instead."
94,8,"""I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this place is""",That line is delivered by Harry Potter himself while admiring the beautiful view offering itself in one of Hogwarts' highest turrets. I liked that little touch.
95,8,Darkness comes full force.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, this is the sixth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry beings his sixth year at Hogswarts and finds a book belonging to the Half Blood Prince. The book helps Harry excel in his potions class and, while learning new dangerous tricks, he takes private lessons with Professor Dumbledore to dig into Lord Voldemort's past and attempt to discover his weakness. "
96,9,The series takes its final turns with pure greatness,"The Harry Potter series has always been on shaky ground and yet after four installments the series only got better and better. All the things you were concerned about...the children aging, keeping the quality from the books (I have never read ANY of the books)...and the series was just mind blowing. Then there was a stumble, a hiccup so to speak. Order of The Phoenix was still brilliant but there was something there that made me think maybe the series was on it's way down in quality. Instead they return guns blazing (metaphorically) with The Half Blood Prince. This installment could be considered completely different than any other before it. There is far more drama, romance, friendship, mystery and suspense and the usual action, Quidditch, and intensity is perhaps toned down to make this bridge between the previous film and the epic upcoming two part finale which I am on the edge of my seat waiting for. Director David Yates obviously has a passion for these characters and more than any other previous director he manages to really put heart and soul into our familiar Hogwart's family. He uses the brilliant characters to bring them to life from the novels."
97,8,It was a terrific experience.,"Sometimes I got angry with myself for not reading the books when I was a kid. Even though it was too late, I read the books. I loved this movie (since I didn't read the book when I was a kid) and it was also a little scary for me. It was a terrific experience."
98,9,Doesn't Get the Credit it Deserves,"Half-Blood Prince is perhaps the most plotting of the 8 films, taking its time with the ongoing Voldemort conflict, but the pay-off is about as satisfying as anything the franchise had presented to that point."
99,1,Always A Dull Moment from Layabout Yates!,"First of all, this film removes even more from the book than any of the others did from their books. While, as others have said, it is impossible to include EVERYTHING from a book so long into a movie so short, there is something to be said for the presence of loyalty in a big-screen fantasy story adaptation. It's only positive aspects were the performances for Ron Weasley's and Slughorn's characters."
100,,And The Franchise Is Back On Track!,"And the magic returns with a bang! Everything that was wrong in Order of the Phoenix is corrected in this excellent sequel as Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince brings back the darkness to the series with an entirely new definition. From its opening moments, it cues the viewers that it's not going to be a very colourful ride this time and every aspect did come together to deliver a cinematic experience that's mystifying, intriguing & entertaining at the same time."
101,7,one of the better Harry Potter films,"I thought this movie was OK, certainly better than some of the other Potter films. As usually, lots was left out of the book. I almost think these films would be better if it was just a series on TV and 6 hours was devoted to each book. From what I remember from reading the book, I think the movie left out a lot of the memories Harry views about Voldermart and his background. Also, I think the ending had a big fight scene between death eaters and the students at Hogwarts. That wasn't in the film. My favorite part from the film was Harry and Dumbledore retrieving the horcrux in the middle of the lake. It seemed close to what was written in the book."
102,7,Friends and enemies of Harry Potter...,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the sixth movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter and Professor Albus Dumbledore who are facing difficult tasks to defeat the evil. In all of that Professor Snape receives long awaited news and his position take Horace Slughorn, who come back from his retirement. Also Lord Voldemort and his followers are really active and from now on there no doubts that Lord Voldemort is back."
103,7,Just like the book,"This film lives up to the book it was based on. Although it's not my favourite instalment in the series, it has a good style and good moments like the ""liquid luck"". The best part of this film is that it all builds up to something bigger and there is plenty to leave us wanting more."
104,8,"You Can Feel the Series Coming to an End, but It's Going Out with a Bang,","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It may not be as good as some previous instalments, but it continues to build, as well as develop it's many characters and its very enticing story, this one is consistently intense, I was at the edge of my seat at many stages. However there was one issue I had, I understand that he wasn't in the book either, but I feel like this film is really lacking energy without a single appearance from Voldermort, he is the franchise's main villain and after letting us see him in the previous two films made it feel very anti-climatic to not have him make an appearance here, as the main antagonist is absent. The performances are consistently improving as the films continue, here everyone is really in top form as it is, for the majority, their sixth or fifth time playing these characters, making their acting feel very natural, as if the character is just another version of them now, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon particularly stand out. Intense with a magical, whimsical atmosphere, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince may not be the series finest, but it's a very fun ride. "
105,5,Okay but lacking,This movie really should have been 2. They left out so much. They skipped the battle at Hogwarts that saw Dumbledore die. Harry's DA or at least Neville and Luna.
106,6,Not A Stand Alone Movie,"15 July 2009. It's fascinating to come across a sequel that in part depends on the original movies from which to came to provide sufficient context from which to enjoy the movie. This is definitely not a stand alone movie and it can't carry itself without the preceding plot stories that came before it. Unlike the LORD OF THE RING SERIES, this latest Harry Potter movie appears to presume one has either read the books or have a decent grasp or recollection of previous Potter movies. The color tone through the movie was tinged orange, a typical technique for contemporary period films portraying the turn of the Century films which didn't really seem to match the set design or story well, and instead appeared to distance the audience from the more clear and sharp, bright colors that would have made this movie more immediate and personal. The beginning sequences seem more haphazard along with the requisite special effects intended to impress and dazzle, but much of it seemed more workmanlike than natural, except for the fun magic shop."
107,1,What rubbish!,"Out of all the Harry Potter movies, I would have to say this is by far the worst. Not only does it not stick entirely to the book (none of them really do) but it is dead boring and does not seem to excite me in the way the other movies have."
108,7,Enjoyable,"Hard-core fans of Harry Potter claim that movie franchise started well enough but it goes worse with every new movie. To me, as to someone who did not read the books, it is quite the opposite. Maybe they don't follow books as much as they should, but actors are growing up and acting improves with every movie, story is more and more interesting and directing and effects sustain same good level. Great entertainment for whole family."
109,7,"Despite Excises, Manages To Capture Essence Of Novel","With the possible exception of the first book/movie combination in the Harry Potter series, each film adaption has done its share of cutting/editing from J.K. Rowling's original work. Luckily, this film version of ""Half-Blood Prince"" (other than its predecessor ""Order of the Phoenix"") manages to maintain its soul despite the inevitable cuts. For a basic plot summary, ""Prince"" sees Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) taking private lessons from Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), where they examine certain memories of a young Tom Riddle in order to be better prepared for his adult Lord Voldemort identity. At the same time, the trio of Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) take the next crucial steps in their wizarding education by learning more advanced potion-making (under new Professor Slughorn(Jim Broadbent)) and even taking the first steps toward apparating. Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) take on larger roles in this installment, while Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) constantly lurks in the background. Like the novel, ""Prince"" is a great piece of fiction primarily because of all the Harry/Dumbledore interactions and their trips into the past of Voldemort. Despite one key ""flashback"" being completely cut out, the movie does a good job of showing those younger Riddle years. Essentially, the heart of the writing remains (unlike how it was completely cut out in ""Phoenix""). The acting also continues to improve, what with Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson probably turning in their best performances to date. Felton as Malfoy also grows quite a bit in this one, and the Weasley characters are always fun to get back to. Almost completely stealing the show is a wonderful performance from Broadbent as Slughorn. Overall, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is a fine book-to-film adaption that will satisfy both the Potter-heads and the more casual fans of the series. Though I won't give any specific spoilers here, the end of the film very strongly hints that the action of the final movie(s) will largely take place outside of Hogwarts."
110,4,Harry Potter And The Inability To Build To A Climax,"Thus after the searing mediocrity and blatant intermediary qualities of ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix"" we arrive at the ""darkest"" of all the wizards novel to film exports, ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince"". For the second time in the series we have a director undertaking the following instalment of our wand waving hero's tale, which begs the question whether or not the studio executives are at all interested in these films. It seems that any appreciation for cinematic achievement has been jettisoned given that the two stand out films in this tale were those directed by one time only ""guest"" directors Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell. However, that is not to say that David Yates hasn't learnt from the failings of his previous experience, and it's also not to say that he has as well. "
111,10,Possibly the best film so far!,"I have just seen Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince today, and i was pleasantly surprised. Having seen OOTP (which, lets be honest, contained a few plot holes), my expectations for the smaller important details being put in was not high. However, the attention to detail in those big scenes of the movie was more than satisfactory."
112,7,About as good as the book,"The Half-Blood Prince is neither my favourite book in the series nor my favourite movie adaption in the series either, but it still makes the most of its source material. There is a lot going on in this film and it all progresses to something bigger."
113,9,"No Spoilers, I've made an unbreakable vow!","Although this one still has far too much missing from the original source, it is definitely my third favourite of the franchise.<br /><br />We're really getting down to the nitty gritty of the septet/octet here, as we finally start to see some movement on how they will actually defeat Voldemort, before they are all struck by a crushing blow to their cause. We also get a glimpse of the Muggle world and their reactions to what's happening."
114,4,Harry Potter and the half good movie for Dumble-mort (dvd),"As the series is now over in DVD, I can at last watch it all, but back in time, just because I prefer to see the cast become younger than older. As i have previously watched only 3 movies, I have 5 other to review and this one is the first."
115,8,half blood prince,"Half blood prince is really good character driven film full with intersting and good dialogue and engaing script,what makes this film special and different then others in franchise is that it doesnt focus on some big cgi moments and battles like upcoming ones but rather gives us intersting story with some new fun charcters,in the end the third act is little weaker then other first and second and they could put some more staff from book to film that would make more sense and easier for members of audience to understand"
116,7,"Good, But SOOOooo Not the Book","I know these movies cannot incorporate every little scrap of nuance from the books. I know that screen time is prohibitive of including all aspects of the story lines. I understand that comparing the blow-by-blow to the literary work is not productive, as there are two prevalent franchises here; the books and the films."
117,8,The Attainment of Age,"Number six in J.K. Rowling's succession of thunderously well-liked stories smacks of a less ostentatious, far more worthwhile approach than the typical annual bigger-is-better summer blockbuster: What we need aren't larger effects but more moving ones, which requires a tale worth telling. Half-Blood Prince's effects are placed so nonchalantly in their invented world that we effortlessly buy into their realism. The brass owl adorning the podium in Hogwarts' dining hall trims until Dumbledore steps forth, when it respectfully strikes a pose and freezes. When Hermione restocks books in the library, they leap out of her hands and locate their proper slots on even the highest shelves. A more-interesting-than-usual quidditch game is set during a convincing, silky snowfall. Magic occurs here as the characters are occupied with love and brokenheartedness. This is a fantasy film, but the subtle idea huddled within is that there's unexplainable fascination adjoining the everyday."
118,9,A Beautiful Epitome of a True Summer Movie,"Mixing several genres such as comedy, horror, romance, action adventure and even a bit of a detective story, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a thrilling summer movie."
119,6,Who is the Half-Blood Prince?,"Half-Blood Prince is the sixth out of eight Harry Potter movies. The tension rises and the final battle between Potter and he who must not be named moves closer. A central character is killed by another major character and you will have a great time if you watched and enjoyed the previous Potter films. Just like films 5, 7 and 8, this movie is directed by David Yates again and the screenplay, as usual, comes from Steve Kloves based on Rowling's novels. The film scored an Academy Award nomination for its cinematography, but lost as all other Potter Oscar nominations did, this time to ""Avatar"". ""Avatar"" is also one of the two films that were even more successful at the box office than Half-Blood Prince in 2009. The other would be a Transformers movie."
120,9,A Fine Adaptation For What It's Worth,"After witnessing the disaster also known as ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" two years ago, I had pretty much written David Yates off. ""Half-Blood Prince"" is not only a more challenging novel to adapt to the big screen, but it also remains my favorite book in the series. Initially I had low expectations for ""Half-Blood Prince"", but after watching a couple of movie trailers and several clips online, I was thoroughly impressed and steadfastly awaiting the release of the film. The scourges of positive reviews calling it the ""best one yet"" only heightened my anticipation. I walked into the theater with lofty expectations, but in the back of my mind I feared for the worst."
121,10,A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Love is in the air. While the muggle world and the world of magic are under siege from the forces of evil, I guess there's always time for our growing teenagers to be frustrated more by the affairs of the heart, rather than be troubled with whether the fate of the world is within your control to steer from collapse, unless of course you're Harry Potter, the Chosen One."
122,7,Harry Potter and the Half-Hearted Effort,"The main problem with the Harry Potter franchise is that it has always been aimed at a specific demographic: fans of the original novels. The first two film adaptations, while well executed and visually spellbinding, were criticized because of director Chris Columbus' decision to keep every major detail from the books (minus the occasional irrelevant side character) in the movies, so that the series' young admirers - including Columbus' own daughter - wouldn't be disappointed. With the exception of Goblet of Fire, the subsequent pictures have, to different degrees, suffered from the opposite problem, namely omissions that cause some scenes to make very little sense unless one has read the books (case in point: the character Kreacher was added at the last minute in the fifth film at the request of J.K. Rowling herself, due to his role in the seventh book, but didn't do anything significant in the one scene featuring him). As such, it is hard for the casual viewer to enjoy the latest entry, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, as anything more than an average blockbuster, especially in light of Warner Bros.' decision to release the film eight months later than originally planned, hoping the extra hype will lead to Dark Knight-style box office success (not that any of the Potter films have failed to make loads of money thus far)."
123,,Most of the fun is watching these kids grow up over the series of movies.,"Stop for a moment and consider, the three stars (Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint) were 11-ish kids when filming for the first Harry Potter movie was done, and now they are all 20-something. It makes me want to go back and watch the original again."
124,1,Another HUGE Disappointment From The Harry Potter Series! HIGHLY OVERRATED!,"After swearing that I would never watch another Harry Potter film after the last five less than average films, I saw a free advanced screening of the sixth average installment, titled, Half Blood Prince, after hearing about most of the critics rave about it. (Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for this!)"
125,9,Alan Rickman was one of the finest actors of our time,Hp6
126,9,A breath of fresh air for Potter fans.,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is possibly one of the only, if not the only, movie in the series that stays true to the novel on which it is based. I say this not from reading it, which I have not, but from the reaction of a friend who has read it a number of times. From a film stand-point, it may be the best so far. Though I still have a soft spot for the first one, John William's magical score and all, this one comes pretty damn close. David Yates shows his true directing talent here which was suspiciously absent from the previous film, Order of the Phoenix. First example in the flashback scenes (of which there are a number of), or whatever the true term of it is, the style of the cinematography almost completely shifts to a darker, more frightful style. The art direction, as with all of the films, continues to mesmerize the audience. The script is witty and I admit I had more than a couple of laughs. I personally felt that the film relied too much on the relationships of the three main characters and less on the main focus of the movie, but thats just me. The acting overall was superb. Nothing really different than the last films. I saw this film with an audience of maybe 1000 at the premiere in New York City, and I can confidently say that not one of those viewers went away with a frown. This is a fantastic magical ride of a movie that I highly recommend."
127,9,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Many reviewers are always upset by what the films leave out. Naturally, and even the harshest of critics would agree that when adapting a book for the big screen some thing must be cut. People simply do not have time (and studios wouldn't want to pay) for films that are twenty four hours long. Now there are always going to be things the book fans, such as myself, think the film should have included, but I believe you should view these films not as a book fan, but as a fan of Harry Potter, it's the same story told in a different way. Adaptation is the key word. I enjoy this film, very much so, Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn is absolutely brilliant."
128,,Adequate entertainment but could have been more thrilling,This film is about Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwart's School for wizards.
129,6,Just average for a non-fan like me...,"Recap: Life and school continues at Hogswarth. And in some cases Hogswarth could be any highschool, with its young students going about their business. So Harry, Ron and Hermione soon is deep in everyday trouble as crushes, unanswered feelings and jealousy. But in other regards it is most definitely not as any other school. A book is found, one with recipes for magical potions, once owned by one called the Halfblood prince. But it also got ominous clues about Voldemort, and evil seems to gather strength. It may just be that Harry and Dumbledore is the only ones that can stop them."
130,5,Super boring,"My favorite Harry Potter book is this one but This movie not close to be. This movie is supposed to talk about back stories of Tom Riddle. His Motive , His past , how he became a villain. WHERE? They waste the time to talking about love stories. I'm okay with that , but they forgot the main point of this one."
131,6,"Pacing issues aside, this is an improvement.","Harry is in his sixth year at Hogwarts and discovers a book that belongs to someone who called themselves the Half Blood Prince. Dumbledore asks Harry to get closer to the new potions teacher, Slughorn, in order to unlock new mysteries about Voldemort. "
132,8,Another strong entry in the series.,"I look forward to seeing new Harry Potter movies more than nearly any other titles. Whether the images on the screen coincides exactly with the images I imagine when reading the books, or not, it's always fun to see this world come to life again and again. The Half-Blood Prince is one of the better books, in my opinion, so I was especially eager to experience the film version. "
133,,The Half-Blood Prince,"The latest installment in the Harry Potter series left me quite optimistic for the upcoming two-part ending to the film adaptation, but left me cold in its own right. My reasons for being hopeful for the future are mostly to do with the fact that Steve Kloves seems to have finally understood that the Harry Potter stories are hugely character-driven, and that adaptations should have that in mind instead of just rushing through the Major Plot Points (and his previous adaptations, which essentially crippled the film series and kept it from reaching its full potential, don't even cover the Small Plot Points which become Major Plot Points in later installments of Rowling's tightly-plotted fantasy saga)."
134,1,Boring!!!! And nothing like the book!!,"I suppose most of my friends over here have said it already: this film has NOTHING to do with the book so I won't elaborate on that. What I will say is, it is BORING... in fact it has no point and the few points it makes, can be done in a matter of an hour. The film is over two hours long and it's filled with nothing but stupid jokes and very little actual facts. It also leaves a lot of questions that could only be explained if you have read the book and you know i.e. who is who and how they got together. Otherwise you are clueless and it feels like a bunch of scenes thrown together for ... no reason at all. The worst of all the films for sure... :("
135,7,1 hour and 20 minutes before the first exciting scene,"It's a good thing I like well-made movies, good acting, and relationship stories, but that's not why I go to Harry Potter movies. I started going to the HP films for the wonder and imagination, my favorites are the day to day magic like making dinner, and scenes where the Hogwarts students are learning magic. There was 1 interesting potions scene, no defense against the dark arts, 1 new discovery by Potter, 1 fun cleaning the house scene, no interesting dining hall magic during dinners, and Voldemort is not in this film. It had some comedic scenes, but nothing to make me laugh long enough to miss anything important. "
136,8,I now know the feeling op disappointment.,I've been waiting for this movie for a long time since book #6 is my favorite of the series...Never have I been more angry or disappointed after watching a movie. I feel like Kyle (southpark) did after Indiana Jones came out. I feel like the HP series just got raped.
137,9,I forgot how really good this was.,"From the build up to the death of Dumbledore and how dark this movie is to the mystery at the end of R. A. B., this is one of the most suspenseful Harry Potter movies there are! How this film wrapped up when I saw this in theaters in 2009 was so great that it made me want to read the 7th book that summer from cover to cover! Plus the fascinating deep dive into Voldemort's past with the horcruxes makes the entire storyline richer, and even makes other films make more sense! It starts off in the beginning very creepily with the mini montage with the tragic score and Bellatrix as well. David Yates does it again with his brilliant directing!"
138,7,Hogwarts: Year Six!!!,"This sequel is better than some others. Voldemort is slowly getting stronger and Dumbledore needs Harry's help to get Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts to teach potions. Draco Malfoy is being recruited by Voldemort to become a Death Eater. While attending class, Harry stumbles upon a textbook that belonged to the 'Half-Blood Prince' which is equipped with additional notes and instructions that allow Harry to excel in class. Dumbledore soon shows Harry memories of Tom Riddle when he was younger. He tells Harry about Horcruxes. If they are destroyed, Voldemort will die. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE!!!"
139,1,Horrible!,"It is shocking that a film can have such great material to work with and still be so bad. The book contained wonderfully rich characters, action scenes, romance, humor, realistic emotions, and a plot that managed to still make sense and hold up under intricate dissection. Why the writer and director deemed the original material unsuitable I will never know. They seemed to labor under the delusion that if the characters had the same names, and they recreated 5 percent of a few scenes from the book, this would be enough. It doesn't come close to capturing the magic (both the kind the reader feels and the wands and wizards produce) of the literary work. "
140,9,good as 2 previous latest sequels,"I am satisfied. There is maturing, real life like experience such as death, and mystery resolving itself in realistic way. Interesting, developing, explained. Keeps me interested enough for later sequels. Always the new stuff in each sequel. Also the relationships and magic tricks are always new to discover, which I like the most."
141,,Growing Pains,"Having survived puberty, ""Half-Blood Prince"" finds the cast of the Harry Potter franchise now with only one thing on their mind: red hot wizard sex!"
142,6,Key points missing!,"If you love the series like I do you will know that in every movie they have to cut parts of the book out. Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating."
143,4,"Very funny, but takes liberties with plot and serious parts are lacking.","As I began to watch, I was excited because I felt like this would be the best movie in the series. The movie was hilarious. Great timing, good acting, and excellent visuals."
144,2,This is utter CRAP!!!,"There is no words strong enough to express my disappointment after seeing the sixth Harry Potter movie! I thought Order of the Phoenix was tragic, but as hard it might be to believe, Half-Blood Prince is worse!"
145,1,The worst movie of the series so far,I went to see the movie the day it opened. I wondered when it was over how in the world they could get it so wrong. The direction this movie took was beyond stupid and unsatisfying. Most of it was disjointed and even having read the book just before going to see the movie I couldn't for the life of me understand how much of it related to the book or story line. The scene at the borrow in the middle was completely unnecessary and made no sense to the storyline.
146,6,Entertaining but still not satisfying for non-book fans,"I enjoyed it more than Order of the Phoenix, mainly because the dark ominousness of the finale actually works this time. But it suffers from the same weakness - emotional inaccessibility, and a general feeling of messiness, both originating in the fact that a huge book is crammed into one movie and a lot is disposed of, but without giving too much thought into forging it into a coherent film. And as someone who hasn't read beyond the third book - I admit it - I felt this was largely an illustration for a book I didn't read, and spent most of the time trying to keep up with the plot and characters, ending up not caring too much for any of them, which means the romantic angle in particular really doesn't work."
147,10,Leaves you definitely wanting those sequels badly,"Just got done watching a midnight screening of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and it was excellent. Definitely makes you wish the next 2 years had passed so that you could see both parts of the last movie already. Harry is now a young man and his friends Hermione and Ron are coming of age. Lots of teen romance and anguish plus some great laughs which I thought really made the movie gel. Of course the action scenes ,especially the scenes in the ocean cave were very intense and dark. "
148,9,A Strong Potter,"By far one of the strongest Potter movie with older themes, darker action and some really dark themes. The audio track is also amazing with a ton of spatial effects."
149,6,Uggg....So much left out,I know I say it with every review I write of this series but Im sorry I have to say it again and its the worst yet. However the movie is not bad the acting is actually getting pretty decent and the special effects are good while the movie is very intriguing and interesting. If you have no read the book you will probably enjoy the movies much more but if you have read the book you know what I mean..they left out too much stuff.
150,4,Severely lacking plot and fluidity,"Rather than watching this movie and complaining about how much they left out from the book and saying how annoyed I am that they let me down. I choose to look at it from another perspective, at least I have read the book and I know the full story, if they leave bits out (which they have, in droves) then I know the actual story so I can fill the blanks (which there are many!) with the information I acquired from the book."
151,1,Harry potter & The half-blood prince SUCKS,"The whole movie was about love connections. The producers and script writers hardly followed the book, just mostly changing things to their likeing. Ill admit there were some good funny parts, but that doesn't excuse the fact that how awful it was. After watching 3/4's of the film i was ready to fall asleep, and finally when the end comes.. when the best fighting is supposed to come! i get disappointed as the skip through all of it.. So i advise everyone to save their time and money and wait maybe for a rental. Its a little to late for me since i wasted my money and wont get the 2 hrs of my life back.."
152,9,UNEVENTFUL BUT GREAT,"Because it focused too much on the love story and less on creating the mystery of who the Half-Blood Prince is, therefore, excluding Dumbledore's death, making this the most uneventful film in the series, along with the fact that I disliked Bonnie Wright's acting & some things did not make sense for people like me who has not read the books, it is very surprising that I still loved ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" IT IS A GREAT MOVIE!"
153,3,did i miss the climax?,"Either I completely missed the climax, or there wasn't one. What happened to the dramatic battles that Harry faces in each book? They seem to have left it out of this movie! The movie is not all that dark. Aside from the death eater attacks, the element of the movie that is focused the most on is the relationships between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and whoever currently likes one of the three. The strained but passionate relationship between Tonks and Lupin is never mentioned in the move aside from Tonks calling Lupin ""Sweetie"" or ""Sweetheart"" (Sorry, I can't recall what she called him). Also, the lessons that Dumbledore thought were so important to Harry were hardly given a thought in the movie. Harry only saw three memories out of the hundreds that Dumbledore had collected in his office. I have to admit that the graphics and special effects were incredible. They really stepped it up since the order of the phoenix."
154,3,The Films Could Have Been Great,"Why is it that they can't make a half decent Harry Potter film? You'd think that with the excellent cast (minus a few which i wont name, yet it is obvious who i mean) and the money they have they'd make brilliant movies but instead they have made 'cheesy' piles of crap which miss out so many important things from the books. As a huge fan of the books i was expecting to see, at least, the story to follow the book well and for the films to be, like the author intended, the films to be dark and to be aimed at adults as well as children. Sadly however this is not the case."
155,3,Changed ending causes annoyance for those who have read the books,"I thought that for a movie that was two and a half hours long they would make sure to include the most important parts from the book and I hoped they wouldn't change too much. The movie sets itself up very nicely for a fantastic finish. Unfortunately, that is not how it ends up. The fact that there is no intense battle at Hogwarts at the end makes me very unhappy. Director David Yates claims that the reason behind removing the battle was because of the final battle in book 7. Well, I don't think that is justification to completely change one of Rowling's books. I am shocked that she gave them the go-ahead to change the ending by so much. If, however, you have not read the books and have only seen the movies than I would imagine you would enjoy this movie a lot more than those who have read the books. I would have easily given this movie a 9 but the last 20 minutes should have been so much different that I just cant. At this point, I just hope Yates doesn't screw up the last two movies."
156,8,Very sad,It is a good film but the last 40 minutes are the most important. It is sad to see another extremely loved character to die.
157,9,The Best of the Series *SPOILERS*,"**CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS** This might very well be my new favorite HP movie. It had a few WTF moments along with a few answers. I have not read any of the books, so I have no basis of comparison there. That being said, I intend to speculate on some things in this post. I am only speculating according to what has occurred on screen up until this moment. Obviously, I have to start with Snape. He's been a very ambiguous character throughout the entire series. There was always that question in the back of my mind as to whether he was actually still a Death Eater or not. After seeing the Half Blood Prince I've never been more sure as to the answer to that question. Snape is most definitely NOT a Death Eater. I had my suspicions about his motivations early in the film. Once I saw the brief glimpse of his conversation with Dumbledore I was pretty certain. He told Dumbledore that he was asking for too much. I wasn't sure right then exactly what the headmaster had asked of him, but I suspected it was something that would not be easy, but would be for the greater good. Obviously, I was right. When Snape raised his wand and performed the forbidden death curse on Dumbledore I knew exactly why. He was protecting Draco, and probably Harry in some way that will be revealed later. Speaking of Draco, Tom Felton absolutely owned this movie. He brought a depth to Malfoy that has simply never been there before. Throughout the series he's been little more than an annoying nemesis for our hero. He's so much more than that in this movie. He is truly an isolated and tortured soul. He is following in his father's footsteps because he has to. The consequences to him and his family would be quite severe if he chose to just be a normal student at Hogwarts. Harry catches a glimpse of the normal kid that Draco could be when he finds him in the bathroom. Of course, Draco ruins the moment by attacking Harry. Again, he feels he has no choice. He doesn't hate Harry like we have always been meant to believe. It's just what he's been conditioned to do. Then, of course, Harry makes the mistake of conjuring a spell that he doesn't understand which nearly kills Draco. This is truly a beautiful moment in the movie. Harry is horrified at what he's done and poor Draco is just a kid who took things too far and is now dying on the bathroom floor. Professor Snape honors his vow to protect Draco and intervenes just in time to save his life. Which brings me back around to Snape's motivation. Everything Snape has done throughout the series has been part of a much larger plan. Snape is like the double agent that you never really know which side he's on. It obviously caused him great personal pain to kill Professor Dumbledore. As Slughorn said, ""Murder tears the soul apart."" I can only imagine this is amplified when one is forced to murder someone they care about. But he did what he had to do. He had to protect Draco from that very fate. Had Draco actually done the deed himself there would most likely be no turning back. His tortured soul would only become more twisted and hateful. Snapes murder of Dumbledore was nothing less than act of compassion for Draco at Dumbledore's request. Dumbledore even pleaded with Snape in his final moments. This could easily be seen as an old man pleading for his life. But Dumbledore knew he was about to die one way or the other. He pleaded with Snape to do what had to be done to spare Draco any further pain. I'm sure that in the next two movies it will be revealed how this all leads back to Harry. Anyway, I definitely loved this movie. I wasn't terribly thrilled with the Order of the Pheonix. This film has definitely put the series back on track."
158,5,By far the worst Hary Potter film,"The trailers advertised the new Harry Potter film as even more exciting, mysterious, and humorous than the first five. An eight-month release delay built up the hype even more. But as with many heavily marketed and highly anticipated movies, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince fell flat. Not only did it not meet fans' high expectations, but it is by far the weakest installment of the series."
159,7,"Yeah, not bad. Weak direction and crap music but otherwise good :)","First I give you my background. Yo, so Azkaban be my favourite so far. Smooth cinematography and a wonderful story energetically and meaningfully told. The first two was also very nice (John Williams in tha house). But Goblet felt rushed. Yeah, it had its moments but dem beats was wack (music not bad per se but didn't enhance the movie enough). Also found that one more fragmented and less distinctive than the earlier ones (which established the whole look and style, y'all). Phoenix worst so far (hopefully ever). Lacked personality (Yates Schmates - no directors' touches). Just going through the motions. And even worse music (yes I consider that incredibly important)."
160,1,"A travesty, a sheer travesty...","My younger brother and I have seen the midnight show of every Harry Potter movie, and we've never been truly disappointed until now."
161,1,What the bloody hell was that???,I really do not understand how Rowling could let all this happen?!
162,9,"""Oh yea, and here's who he is""","I always maintain that I enjoy movie adaptations of novels more because I never read the novels. People were telling me this movie wasn't good but coming out of it, I didn't see why. To me it was - as all the previous Harry Potters have been - a fun movie filled with gorgeous special effects and good actors. It was only after discussion with my movie companion that I realized a lot of the novel had been left out. I kinda guessed as much, since the movie really wasn't about any Half-Blood Prince and the revelation of his identity at the end was like an ""Oh yea, and here's who he is."" "
163,1,Harry Potter and the half blood suck,This movie was an extreme let down. One has to have read the book in order to pull together the huge holes in this movie. The climax... there was none. Why... all of a sudden .. where those people in Hogwarts? There was no building up to it...
164,1,J k Rowling should have murdered the screen writer and the directer,"Sure, its full of impressive visual effect, I'll give you that. But besides that, its a dreadful waste of a good novel and our time. shouldn't the main focus of the 6th one, be training Harry to fight? Instead of cramp it with high school drama, who likes whom, who is jealous of whom, who wants whom.....The story was broken down into tiny pieces that don't really connect to on another. I don't for those didn't read the book, how do they understand everything. WHY are they keeping Yates as the director? There are hundreds of much more amazing ones whom can do the story justice. I mean, how many films have the scene of a creepy dark lake, and all of a sudden something come out the dark water to drag the main character into the lake. Its so cliché. Now I really worry about the last two, hope they won't be so disappointing."
165,1,By far the best book; by far the worst movie,"I've been looking forward to this movie since 2005. The novel is characterised by a darker, more mature mood - fitting considering it's the penultimate book in the series; Rowling does a good job setting the scene for the final battle. This was also the very first book I read the series - and got me reading the others."
166,1,Worst Harry Potter of the Movie Franchise,"If you read the book you know the story is stretched out the only good thing in it was Tom Riddle aka Voldemort's origins which came from the pensieve and how the black encrusted stone ring came to be. And how his mother woo his father etc. None of that happened which was the best detailed story of how he became evil leaving that out means the audience won't know why Voldemort became bad. The other major thing they left out was the battle at the end which was a letdown. All and all it was 2hrs 30mins, I would recommend to skip the 2 hrs and watch the last 30 mins where Dumbledore and Harry enter the cave because the rest of the movie is really boring and a waste of time. They just talk nonsense for 2 hrs."
167,8,"The dark, ominous mood continues since The Goblet Of Fire and is felt the strongest here.","Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince is the sixth out of a projected eight films from the wildly-popular long-running fantasy series which began its cinematic life in 2001. Adapted from J.K. Rowling's original novels of the same name, the Harry Potter films have, over the years, been helmed by four different filmmakers: Christopher Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Newell's The Goblet Of Fire (2005) remains the weakest of the bunch thus far. But ever since Yates took up the directing job for The Order Of The Phoenix (2007), the series is looking at a revival. The Half-Blood Prince confirms that revival."
168,2,99% disappointment,"To begin with I would like to say if anyone has an address to write to David Yates so I can tell him what a mess he has made of the best book in the series could you please let me know. This is the first time on any film I have truly been angry enough to want to say something about it. Some previous comments say only the most die hard fans of the book won't enjoy this film. Well firstly thats not true, I know a few people (bearing in mind today is only the third day of release at my cinema) that either hated or were extremely disappointed with the film. Secondly I would have thought the fans should be the people who were considered the most important to please. As far as I'm concerned, there has been little or no thought towards how much the fans needed this film to be mostly like the book. Naturally they could never fit everything in without making it into two films, but the fact that as far as I can remember, every scene in the book between Ron and Lavender was put in the film but the most important ones like Riddle meeting the Gaunts, his father, Hepzibah Smith, the importance of where HARRY NOT GINNY leaves the Princes book in the room of requirement were all left out. The ending was an utter disappointment, when I read the book I was so upset, the film... nothing. Harry was left to stand by like a coward whilst Dumbledore was killed. The Death Eaters walked off site without a care in the world, Harry shows two attempts to get back at Snape, it was absolutely dreadful. I lost pretty much all hope with the lame additional scene at the Weasleys, if they hadn't put that in we could have seen the battle at the end of the film and Dumbledores funeral. Another irritation is the fact that not once is Dumbledores black hand explained, the way Harry and Ginny REALLY got together, the fact that they are actually broken up at the end of the book. Key characters were either non existent or practically ignored. I can only guess that Bill and Fleurs wedding is off since they weren't even in this film. I'm outraged that Nevilles only line was 'I didn't get into the Slug Club'. In the book he does. In my opinion Neville has been made to look like a loser in this film as he was in the first few when in fact as he showed in the 5th film he is brave and a brilliant wizard... just like his parents. One final point, I'll be intreagued to find out how Harry works out what the horcruxes are as the Hepzibah Smith scene being missed out means Dumbledore could not give him the clue that Voldemort liked to use great and powerful objects to hide his soul in. In the book Harry knows what the majority of Horcruxes are likely to be. My only hope is the fact that number 7 is two films means they won't have to cut too much out and they won't mess around with the plot. I sincerely hope JK Rowling was not party to this film because if she agreed to even 10% of it, she is a complete sell out."
169,2,Harry Potter is a big coward !!! At least according to the movie ...,"I'm almost too angry to write a comment ! This is my first ever comment here. I give the movie a 2 because it has nicely filmed images and effects ... but there it ends, I would've liked giving it a 0."
170,8,"Hopes were high, and well met","As is any fan of the well-written Harry Potter saga, I expected great things from this latest film installment: The Half-Blood Prince; with David Yates again at the helm why wouldn't I expect anything less? By 3:00AM I walked out of the the midnight showing tired, but happily entertained. This series is built for success from the start and this film carries it along just as well as the book did. There is so much to like about this film from the witty humor, suspenseful action, thrilling adventure, and breath-taking cinematography. This particular episode of the saga seems to be rooted in the real world (or Muggle World) rather than solely in the world of Hogwarts and Wizards. This gives the movie an excellent sense of drama and works well since the fantastical feel is kept alive throughout."
171,9,Magic has returned to the world of Harry Potter!...,"After being disappointed by Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince was a nice surprise. Goblet of Fire remains my favourite, but this one's not far behind. The absence of Dursleys was a good start, and although the film begins in the 'real world', it's a more exciting scene than the last film's opening, as Death Eaters (including a wolfman dude) wreak havoc, leaving Muggles thinking ""WTF?""...including a waitress who gets chatted up (and then stood up) by self-confessed ""tosser"", Harry Potter, who's whisked away by Dumbledore to the world of magic and we're introduced to part-time armchair, Professor Slughorn. Jim Broadbent's character is a welcome addition, as Slughorn likes to 'collect' special students and the prospect of acquiring 'the Chosen One' is too good to pass up. Meanwhile, the still wickedly fun Bellatrix Lestrange and Draco Malfoy's mother, Narcissa, have a special mission for Draco (and ensure Snape keeps him safe/makes sure he follows through via a magical 'Unbreakable Vow' handshake)."
172,9,From someone who hasn't read the books to people that haven't read the books,"The Good: - The actors and actresses that we've come to know over the previous five movies really came into their own in this one. At one point, for whatever reason, Harry is very jolly. He does it well and is hilarious in the process. In the hospital Hermione shows a range of emotion and it was quite convincing and rather touching. Of the three main characters Ron probably matured the most. A great job done by all. - This movie was very dark which is appropriate giving the ending of the prior movie - There was a ton of character development in all of the youths. - This was the funniest of any of the movies thus far. - The last half hour changed the relationships that some of the key characters will have with the others in the following movie(s)."
173,8,"A slower paced, intriguing mystery",POSITIVES:
174,3,Abrupt decline in quality,"Visually awful: trying to show how Voldemort's darkness was consuming Hogwarts, they made ugliest Potter movie to date.<br /><br />Slow: With little actuallly happening (as important as it might be), the movie becomes tedious and boring.<br /><br />Overtly melodramatic: Almost tv quality of melodrama all over the place. Maybe justified in the books, the constant whining and crying from some characters made it harder to enjoy.<br /><br />Awful new characters: The annoying Jim Broadbent as the annoying proff. Horace Slughorn was... annoying in every single scene. And we had too a young Voldemort, the typical ""sociopath kid"" with the cliché and annoying sociopathics faces and remarks."
175,7,The Half Blood Prince Was Good Despite Some Flaws,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good despite some flaws. Director David Yates is admirable in making this movie based on the popular J. K. Rowlings book series. Daniel Radcliffe continues to show why he was perfectly cast as Harry who begins his sixth year at Hogwarts. Radcliffe is effective in the role and has matured over the years as an actor. Well done. Ruper Grint and Emma Watson also return as Harry's best friends who are equally impressive like Radcliffe. All three of them have grown up a lot and it shows. The same can go for Tom Fenton whose role in this one is a bit larger than the others portraying Draco as a conflicted young man whose given a task he may not be able to do. The rest of the cast are good in their limited screen time including Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robbie Coltrane. Ralph Fiennes is absent as Voldemort but hopefully his role will be larger in the next one than his cameo appearance in The Order Of The Phoenix. This movie is definitely a little darker than the other ones and I'm sure The Deathly Hallows will have that same sort of feel to it. The Half Blood Prince doesn't have a whole lot of action in it but the parts that do are well executed. What this movie does have is character development, drama, some suspense, humor, and a little romance. The running time of 153 minutes did make the movie drag in some areas but it's still worth watching. The identity of the Half Blood Prince surprised me and I didn't necessarily see coming but I suspected it might have been him. Overall I thought this film was good despite some flaws. Fortunately however the good outweighed the bad. If you're a big Harry Potter fan than chances are you'll enjoy this one just as much as the others. It has character development, drama, humor, romance, and some action with solid performances by the cast."
176,10,"Best in the Series, Hands Down","By far and away, this venture into the Potterverse was the best to date. Our kids have grown into the skin of their characters, and the new younger characters now are populated by folks that have skills to match the roles. And no question that we finally are getting to see the professors, headmaster, and supporting adults at the absolute top of their form."
177,8,Slow paced installment but very stylish,Rating
178,10,Top Quality continues in 6th movie,It's our family tradition to go to see new Potter films the first full day that they are released.
179,6,Harry Potter 6,"Harry Potter is now more onto the teenage drama, the first few movies are on the fantasy side. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood prince's pace is not as fast as the recent Harry Potter movies as it is more like a drama. The characters do not do much action, just babble and kiss. I have not read the book so I do not know whether the movie is following according to the book's pace. Though it is heavy on drama, I still enjoyed it."
180,10,the best installment.....................,"As beautifully made as it is -- and this may be the best-looking, best-directed Potter film yet -- there's an undeniable level of frustration built into ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Basically it comes down to: Can we get on with this? The film's story is so transitional -- it's mostly a mixing of giddy teen romance and frustrated quest -- that it feels like filler on the way to the series' conclusion. Well-made, even arresting filler, true; but come on."
181,10,Magic Returns to the Series in the Best Installment Yet,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that Harry Potter's sixth movie recently hit theaters. As always, the films are good, but this one is my favorite so far. Though the film relies a bit too much on teenage romance, the action scenes are so well done and the film is beautifully shot that it is possible for anyone not to like it. Fans of the book may be a little disappointed by it because it cuts key scenes, but I have read the book and still loved the movie."
182,,Some Great Visual but Way Too Long,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) 
183,5,Disapointing,"Movie was uneven and dragged at times. The infiltration of Hogworths was very disappointing. Sad that one supporting character in the book wasn't in the film.<br /><br />However, the scene where Draco Malfoy in which he is both torn and terrified of the task he was given by ""You Know Who"" was a powerful one. It showed that Tom Felton has the acting chops."
184,5,Slow and meandering,"I don't understand why this got 7.6. I thought Order of the Phoenix was vastly superior to this film. I found once again this film lacked the action and energy of its predecessors. Where as you love to hate Umbridge in #5, I don't think Slughorn has any real lasting effect in this film. Dumbledore only appears in about 5 scenes, there is a huge surprise 3/4 of the way thru I won't spoil it. They touch on love and romance in this one as the characters were 19+ by this point. Just overall it was a very slow burn of a film. I will admit these types of films are not what I typically watch but have given them a second go. I still think 1,3,5 are better than 2,4,6. I see if it reigns true for Deathly hollows."
185,1,Awful. Worst HP movie AND DVD,worst thing ever. the DVD doesn't even have special features; there's not even commentary or its own trailers. completely sloppy.
186,10,Funny and darker,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the sixth film in the franchise and begins the end of a series of epic films in a Harry Potter movie franchise."
187,7,The book is still better but I have to say HP6 the movie is good!,Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince.
188,1,Worst Potter,Most important parts of the book were missing or changed in a senseless way. There also a lot of things where you have no clue whats going on if you haven't read the book.
189,10,Sweeping Stylish Sorcerers Tale,"I don't want to spoil anything but its great a few scenes stand out as having been trimmed other than that a perfect 10. Have no doubt this is the perfect sequel to the Order of the Phoenix and I have no doubt the next two films are in good hands. I laughed, I gasped, I cried and I can't wait for the next installments Harry is growing up, and so are his friends, the end is coming...who will be there on the side of light to defend the muggles from the darkness. New twists and questions as Malfoy begins his new journey down a path only one can guess will lead to life changing decisions. Who is the Half Blood Prince this and more come to light by the end of the movie you will just have to buy a ticket and find out...Daniel Radcliffe gives a more complex performance and Michael Gambon shows us just what it is to be Dumbledore in these dark times."
190,6,Underwhelming,By January 2013 I had never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. I decided to start with the movies.
191,8,Excellent Harry Potter Entry,"The imagination used in this and all the Harry Potter films is really quite remarkable. The special effects are creative and amazing, beautifully done. The production values are top notch in all areas. Excellent cinematography, sound, score, editing, art direction, lighting, costume design and screenplay. Very well acted, especially from the established older actors, like Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman etc. Daniel Radcliffe is aging very well into the Harry Potter role, as is Rupert Grint. A wonderful movie that is often enthralling and has touches of humor to keep it light and entertaining throughout."
192,1,Harry Potter and the Half-Assed Film,What an total and utter disappointment.
193,1,First time i've wanted to walk out of a cinema.,"And I did.. for about 20 minutes. My bathroom break was far more entertaining. If it wasn't for my lady friend (she fell asleep) who wanted to watch it. I've not read the books. I don't want to. I watched the first movie, did nothing for me. And this? This? RUBBISH... someone has to say it... absolute rubbish. How can it make so much money, be so popular, have great actors & still be a pile of rubbish? There is nothing to help an outsider.. nothing to help you understand what's going on. I don't think there IS much going on. I just think it's rubbish... ""wands on high"" .. laughable."
194,1,all expectations in the dustbin,"Well to start with the movie is a love triangle of Hermione,Ron and one another new girl.Yes harry potter plays a role too and he too tries to carry on his love story.This movie is more of a love story in which each of the character tries to be involved in the love.There is one action scene in the movie which lasts for 20 seconds and that too not good.Action sequences were hugely missed in the movie.The movie is not worth money.The director has played with the emotions of the audience.I am saying that because i am a big fan of Harry potter series.And the screenplay was also pretty bad.I would recommend that not to go for this movie.It will destroy your interest in the coming harry potter movies."
195,1,Unbelievable schizoid con-job--Worse than a really bad Hindi movie!,This is nothing like any of the previous movies. The first 20 minutes of the movie gives you the whole plot outline. And this is without my having read the book or knowing the storyline. The 133 minutes remaining is unmitigated tripe. No need to see any more as the rest of the time is just a meandering tedious journey to the inevitable end. Reminiscent of juvenile play-practice or a really bad Hindi movie where the script is written on the sets just before shooting the scenes.
196,1,Nothing at all like the book.,"This movie was not at all like the book. The only similarities were the characters, a couple scenes in the movie, and the name. The director completely cut out everything that the books created. I literally stopped caring about the movie about ten minutes into it."
197,3,When are the Avid book readers going get what we're looking for?,"Like many of you, I went to see the Midnight showing of the movie. And like the 5 other people that I went with, we are left wondering WTF? We have read all seven books and own the movies on DVD. And I think that it's sad that while reading the books, we each envisioned the movie in similar ways. In the movies, the characters who are not important are the stars of the show! For the followers who are only interested in the movies, then you must be pleased. But I'm tired of being jerked around by the movie producers! From the Sorceror's Stone to Half Blood Prince, the movies have left out IMPORTANT PIECES of INFO! For example, where the hell has Percy been the past 4 years? In the books he's the most backstabbing individual in town! What happened with Creature, Dobby and the girl house elf (my apologizes for it slipping my mind right now)? What happened to showing us how the betrayal REALLY happened with the Order? How sick, twisted, disturbed and resentful Voldemort really was with his background and lineage? Im freaking over it! I wait years between movies only to get movie blue balls. PLEASE WARNER BROTHERS, FOR ALL THAT'S GOOD IN THE WORLD, GIVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS TRULY NEEDED FOR THE DEATHLY HALLOWS OR I WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE MY OWN COMMENTARY ON TOP OF THESE MOVIES TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH! Harry's story is one of despair, betrayal, loyalty, disappointment, strength, friendship, jealousy and destiny. Show all it's sides so everyone can get the big picture."
198,9,An Underwhelming Film Saved by Great Ending,"This movie is incredibly disappointing, especially when considering it's source material. Half-Blood Prince was one of my favorite books in the entire Harry Potter series. But this film is nothing like the book it came from. This movie felt bland and felt like something big was missing. About halfway through I knew this movie would be my lowest rated in the entire franchise, but then the ending happened. The ending of this film is easily the best of the entire series, and I think it's even superior to the graveyard scene from Goblet of Fire. Overall, this was an unbelievably disappointing film that was saved by a perfect ending."
199,6,Obligation sucks.,"Before the movie: There is an obligation with Harry Potter. Not as much initial excitement as before , but some strange moral obligation to go to the theater and commit. I'll go to the theater, but unlike the last 5 movies, perhaps I won't go to the midnight showing. But then I'll be haunted with a new pile of regrets: not having seen the second movie until the DVD came out and not having seen the third film until the DVD. But I came back at four! But was only left with disappointment with the fifth. Ironically, I've been to every midnight showing of Pirates (Trilogy?) and I did not like the first one."
200,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"It is fair to say that these family films started lightly and went slowly darker and becoming a little scary for young children, but you can't imagine it being any other way, and this sixth film in the series is a good mixture of both feels. Basically Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is still traumatised after the events in the Ministry of Magic, witnessing Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) killing godfather Sirius Snape, but with encouragement from Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) he is determined to return to Hogwarts, returning with former professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent). Meanwhile the Death Eaters are causing havoc in the Muggle world destroying the Millennium Bridge, and in the wizard world destroying shops in Diagon Alley, and Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) is with them, including Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory), Draco's mother, making the Unbreakable Vow that he will see Draco (Tom Felton) protected and kill Dumbledore. Harry, with Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) return to Hogwarts which is under tight security, Slughorn doing potions, and Snape doing Defence Against the Dark Arts, and taking one lesson of potions Harry finds a textbook for it which used to belong to the ""Half-Blood Prince"". Ron meanwhile has become successful as Gryffindor's Quidditch goalie, gaining a crush and possible girlfriend in Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), it is possible that Hermoine may be jealous, despite not showing to Ron himself, while Harry is jealous Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) is hanging around with Dean Thomas (Alfred Enoch). After surviving an attack from the Death Eaters and watching the Weasley family home burnt down, Harry is told be Dumbledore to stay close to Slughorn, he was brought back for a specific reason, he holds a memory that could be the key to why Lord Voldermort, or Tom Riddle, has immortality. Eventually after some time, and using a Luck potion he won Harry is able to extract the memory from Slughorn for the Pensieve stone basin to see the completed memory, Tom Riddle discovered immortality through the power of Horcruxes, devices to store parts of his soul. After Ron recovers from poisoning, having a love potion go away from his system, and speaking unknowingly speaking Hermoine's name in front Lavender, Harry has a quick fight with Malfoy who he has been suspecting of bad things. After getting out of this, and Snape healing Draco's injuries, he and Ginny hide the book he found so he can't be tempted to use it anymore, and they have a kiss, and next Dumbledore wants him to join him in a mission to find one of the seven Horcruxes. One has already been destroyed, Tom Riddle's diary, and in the seaside cliff cave Dumbledore tells Harry to obey his orders to make him drink a mind-altering and deadly liquid to leave a small pendant, and they get away after a near attack from the creatures in the cave. When they return to Hogwarts, Harry goes to get Snape for help, but then Malfoy comes to fulfil his mission to kill the Professor, but he is weak, and Snape turns up and casts the Killing Spell pushing Dumbledore off the tower and making him fall to his death, with Harry watching and unable to help. The end of the film sees all the students and teachers of Hogwarts gathering around to mourn the death of the Heammaster, the Horcrux pendant is revealed to be fake, and Harry, Ron and Hermoine are bound with each other to find the real ones and destroy them to kill Voldermort once and for all. Also starring Geraldine Somerville as Lily Potter, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, Jamie Waylett as Vincent Crabbe, Josh Herdman as Gregory Goyle, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, Katie Leung as Cho Chang and Ben Shephard as Diagon Alley Father. The acting is still on top form from all the cast, the story is easy enough to follow and understand, just don't expect to see Voldermort and only mentioned, and of course the magic created by the brilliant special effects and make up are great viewing, a terrific fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
201,7,"a summer blockbuster with comedy, horror, dread, romance... just not in a varied order","I confess, I'm still one of those who hasn't read the Harry Potter series. My exposure is simply that I've seen the movies, with the exceptions of Azkaban and Goblet, only once a piece (and for those two only in little pieces on TV), and that I enjoy them, more or less, as pieces of big, bright, horror-and-magic filled spectacles with more British actors than can possibly be cast. Yet from what I've heard book six in the series, the Half-Blood Prince, is more than just a transitional book on the way to the conclusion in book seven: it's a book filled with insidious dread and psychological mind-games and depth that can be comparable to the best in mature literature as opposed to just simple 'kiddie' fare, and even features some moments of extreme violence and horror that, according to one close source, could have potentially given the film adaptation an R rating."
202,10,"The Best Movie out of The Series For Somebody, least according to some....","As an die-hard fan of the harry potter series i slept many sleepless nights wondering how will be the HBP movie. But when i watched the movie First day first show. I was far more satisfied by it. The series has come a long way from only fantasy movies to the movies which contains emotions, drama, tragedy, romance & comedy also. This movie as according to many people is considered the best in the series(including me also) & worst by some. But i want to ask those people who considered it worst? That they are screaming hard that many points have been removed in the film. The reason is simple & straight that the movie is not only created for us fans but also general people who want some entertainment. If whole of the book was copied from scratch the i will be afraid to say that the movie may not have done that well as it is doing now. I agree that i also was baffled by the end but the same time my eyes turned moist. So i request first & foremost to all Harry Potter fans that please support this movie to the fullest and give it high ratings. Because it was worth it."
203,9,Getting Darker,As I am a fan of the books and the films I was expecting something good. I can definitely say that I was not disappointed.
204,10,I say this every year...,"I say this every year but this was definitely the best Potter film yet. I've read the book twice so it was easy for me to pick up on the mistakes, added scenes and the ones they left out, despite all of that it made a summer blockbuster."
205,9,A nicely done revision of the famous book.,The Half-Blood prince is another wonderfully done film in the famous film franchise. In this installment we all learn many more new things about the connection that Harry and Voldemort share. Along with Harry's and his friends lives going crazy. And as things are looking up for Harry he must learn the hard way that he must end the battle against Voldemort before he takes over everything.
206,8,"""Times like these, dark times; they do funny things to people""","One of the most intriguing elements of the Harry Potter series thus far has been the distinct artistic styles of each of the four participating directors – Chris Colombus, Alfonso Cuarón, Mike Newell, and David Yates. Though I had misgivings about Yates, who fumbled awkwardly with the pacing and tone of 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007),' he seems to have made good on his second chance. 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)' sees Yates finding his stylistic niche in the franchise, adapting to the ever-darkening scope of the novels with a visual mood that can only be described as pre-apocalyptic. Like ominous storm clouds enveloping the sky, the film draws dark curtains over its characters' world, signalling a Judgement Day that is impending and inevitable. Regrettably missing is the sheer ""magic"" of the earliest instalments, replaced with a foreboding spectre of doom; older children will no doubt embrace this tonal shift with the utmost enthusiasm, but their younger siblings would be well-advised to wait for a few more years."
207,1,Do they have the right to change the script ?,"This was the worst Harry Potter movie ever. I wonder if the Author knew about the scenario, cause we supposed to learn about Voldemort (Heir of Slytherin) in this movie and the Horcruxes. How did Dumbledore cursed while trying to destroy one? Did anyone see it? Or the necklace? How did Voldemort obtain the necklace, before Albania or after it :D. How did Ron start dating with Lev? it was because of Victor Krum, but did we see it? Phoenix??? Funeral??? Kids seems like they were used to the death of Dumbledore, where were the tears and prick of conscience of Harry? (he supposed to be stunned under the cloak and that was why he couldn't stop Snape killing Dumbledore)Minister's proposal? ETC.."
208,6,"Definitely Not the Best, But Still Entertaining","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth installment in the long-running series and usually by this point, franchises start to go down the gutter but is Harry Potter one of them? Let's find out!"
209,4,Budget Harry Potter,"Unfortunately this addition feels like a budget movie among a great series, something feels missing and things seem less suspenseful, slightly more amateur acting and a more boring flow. Feels like a shame."
210,1,This movie is being shown on TV,... and I'm on IMDb looking to see if I'm the only one who found this film tedious. Looks like I'm not!
211,10,May be the best Harry Potter movie yet,"There is a story that tells when the great Fred Zinnemann, director of such classics as High Noon, and Walter Murch were editing Zinnemann's Julia. Two test screenings had gone disastrously, and cuts had to be made. They realized a certain sequence had to go. As editor Murch went to make the cut, Zinnemann spoke that when he read that particular scene in the script he knew he could make this movie. Murch froze. Was he about to cut out the heart and soul of the movie? Murch turned to Zinnemann and made a motion, as if to say, ""Well?"" Zinnemann nodded. ""Do it."""
212,3,"Please do not kill the next book, make a decent adaptation for once","Can anybody why an unknown writer like Steve Kloves and a mediocre director like David Yates, took the best and most successful saga ever written and probably and destroyed like this. Not only Half Blood Prince movie is less than half of the novel; but this is a two and a half hours movie where almost NOTHING happens. I suspect, the director unable to transmit the complexities of the book (this and the next one are the darkest of the series) and decided to just fill up the time with unimaginative action scenes (not even in the book) and empty enlarged situation; but nothing that benefits the movie at all. As an example; if you want to know what is the meaning HALF BLOOD PRINCE you will have to read the novel. You will no WHO IS thanks to phrase by the end (""I am the HALF BLOOD PRINCE"" ) but that's all the reference you will get on the books title. If the main story is not even there, do not expect the secondary's ( but important), to be even mentioned. They aren't. Just one thing; as much as I love the characters and the actors behind them; this movie is an insult to any reader and fan of the books"
213,4,Definitely not as good as my favorite book,"This reminded me a lot of Twilight. It concentrated much more on the romance than actual important parts of the plot. It jumped all over the place. Honestly, if I had not reread the book a week ago I would have been so confused. But then again I spent the whole movie wondering where different parts were. Basically read the book again to get the plot but try not to think about it when watching the movie."
214,8,"Not the most action-packed of the films, but a worthy adaptation nonetheless.","As it happens every time a new ""Harry Potter"" film is released, there was a giant amount of hype surrounding ""Half-Blood Prince"". Add to the fact that it's obviously going to be popular due to the Potter phenomena that's swept the world over the last 10-12 years or so, the movie was met with glowing reviews - many indicating it was the best film in the saga yet."
215,5,"Since I'm not a fan of Harry Potter, I can't really give this a fair review...but I'll try.","Okay, here's the deal: I'm not a Harry Potter fan at all. I never got into the books and the first movie just bored the hell out of me. So, since I'm supposed to be reviewing every movie in 2009, I dreaded having to see this. Luckily I got it out of the way rather quickly last night at a midnight showing (the theater was filled to the brim with ""Potter Nerds"")."
216,8,Hilarious and heartbreaking. Captures well the awkwardness of teen romance.,"Harry joins Dumbledore in a quest to discover details about Voldemort's past that could lead to his undoing in the future, all while the teenage trio deal with humorous and heartbreaking relationship woes. This sixth film deftly balances mystery, comedy, and romance for its first two hours, wisely slowing the pace to give its characters room to breathe and grow before thrusting them into the breathless, chilling, and genuinely heartbreaking last half hour. Michael Gambon here gives the definitive portrayal of Dumbledore, and the relatively lighthearted initial tone serve as a brilliant contrast to the earth-shattering encroachment of evil; it truly feels like there's something to lose, and the stakes are set high for the finale. "
217,6,Too much teen drama and not enough magic,"Harry is back in the sixth installment of Harry Potter. There's lots of romance in the air, so much that it is clouding the actual plot. But, let's see what Harry and David Yates have in store for us. "
218,1,Opinion of someone who hasn't read the book before,"--- NO SPOILERS FROM HERE --- Some people claim this movie is perceived better if you hadn't read the book before because you don't expect certain things to happen, so the sole fact that movie is different from the book (which isn't bad by itself alone) doesn't make you angry. Well, exactly for this reason I never read the Harry Potter book before I see the corresponding movie, so I watched Half-blood Prince being as clean as possible, without any expectations whatsoever. And guess what? Even from this point of view, this movie just SUCKS!!! I won't write long lists of things that were present in the book but not in the movie, like other fans. These didn't actually annoy me when I watched the film, for the aforementioned reason. You can just count on a lot of things being unexplained and completely unclear, simply leaving a lot of loose ends and some things don't even fit. If you haven't read the book (like me), you won't understand plenty of things, and if you have read it - better keep away from the movie to not ruin your mood."
219,9,"Adventure, Action, Love, Comedy, Darkness, Heros, Villains and most importantly MAGIC!!!","First off I'd like to say that I have read the book twice and obviously loved it, so I am perfectly aware of what was differences, however it's a filmmakers perspective on the book, things work on the page that don't necessarily work on screen, like no end battle was a big one, yeah I missed it, but it would have been extremely repetitive judging on what takes place in the last book. Certain characters or scenes that played out in your head may be different in the movie, because obviously the director, cinematographer and screenplay writer have different heads then you do."
220,8,Dark days ahead...,"I was quite surprised by how much I liked this one. Not that I didn't like the previous ones, but I was so in love with the books that I never felt completely satisfied by the movies. However, in this case, the book was actually my least favorite of the series, but the movie has turned out to be my favorite so far."
221,8,Great...but not the best,"Ah yes Harry Potter is always a treat to watch because you know by now it is going to be entertaining.With this one i had that ""WOW"" factor but a few problems along with it."
222,7,Good Potter Film,"I am not a very big fan of Harry Potter let me start off just by saying that. I only read the very first book and didn't like it much but see why kids would love the stories. I have seen most of the movies and like them somewhat better than the book I read but still didn't enjoy them all that much, again I see they are more for the kids who love the Potter stories. This movie I took 2 kids to and I thought it was an enjoyable film, it seems like the actors are starting to ""grow up"" and they are given more grown up issues to deal with and stories to tell. Particularly good I thought was the girl who played Hermione she had some great parts in this movie. The story is darker which I like for the older kids and adults who go to see this movie but they don't go too over the top with it it is still a good story and ""believable"" at least as far as any story like this can be believable."
223,8,"Good atmosphere, great cinematography, and some fine performances overcome narrative troubles","The problem Steven Kloves had when he adapted ""The Half-Blood Prince"" was that the source novel doesn't contain a naturally cinematic story. You're not quite sure what everything is building up to. What is ""The Half-Blood Prince"" about? Voldemort's secret? That mysterious potions book? Ron making a fool of himself in romance? "
224,6,Disappointing!,The sixth instalment in the internationally loved wizarding franchise has been perhaps one of the most awaited films of the decade; even more so considering the gruelling year fans have had to wait since it was decided to push the film back 12 months.
225,3,Harry Potter and the Halfwitted Director,"OK...so we're reaching the final chapter of the franchise, and the inevitable confrontation between the forces of good and evil are ever fast approaching."
226,10,The best Potter movie so far,"I loved this movie. The opening sequence was explosive, especially in IMAX 3D, the storyline was dark (very), Draco Malfoy was even more evil, the acting was superb, the special effects were amazing--in other words, everything a Potter fan could hope for."
227,5,Highly disappointing,"This film was quite disappointing and did not live up to the previous film that was done by David Yates. In the series of all the movies made from the books, this one was just slightly better than the horrible (Prisoner of Azkaban). The actor the chose to play slughorn was all wrong. Slurred speech, Uneven delivery, and just looked wrong for the part. The movie jumps from one chapter to the next going, by the book, where a full chapter is done in 1 minute in the movie. There were some parts and scenes that had nothing to do with the book, this confuses me. Why waste the time putting stuff in that isn't there, and leaving stuff out that should be? (Leaving out Bill weasley, dobby and Kreature, Minister Scrimgore, Fudge, and numerous other characters was unforgivable) Yes, i know, you cant do the WHOLE BOOK for a movie, but I made this movie, i could do a MUCH BETTER job, and maybe ad 10 minutes to the movie, and tell the story much better. The one bright aspect is that the main actors aren't the cute kids anymore, and have grown up to be wonderful actors. Had i know, i would have waited for this film to come out on DVD instead of paying to see it. I am sure it might do 230 million dollars, but they need to put that much money into the value of the writing and production of the film."
228,2,Garbage.,"First of all, I have not read the Harry Potter books nor do I have any intention of doing so. I went to see this because my girlfriend loves the books, which means I had to. That said, I haven't had any problems enjoying or at least tolerating the previous movies. I even rather liked the first two, but this movie was trash. Absolutely trash."
229,1,I hate the creator of this film more,"This was easily the worst film among the lot guys....I don't know what the other guys mean by ""great film""....maybe Warner Bros them-self is posting these comments....I had read from newspapers that this film has lots of romance and comedy.....But unfortunately that is the ONLY thing that this movie has.....and these jokes were mostly un-laughable....and the romance was non-palpable I am a lover of HP series (movies and books both)....but i don't remember each and every line like some of the fanatics.....i only remember the outline.....I wont say a movie is bad just because it deviated from the book....I am judging the film just own its own merit...ITS REALLY Disappointing....virtually no magic, no mentioning of possible horcrux materials, too little Tom Riddle memories, and the final battle scene -well there was no battle.."
230,1,spoiler? how it could be possible?,"An awful movie? Yes, this is the least I could said about this mess. Spoilers? Maybe, if you can find a plot in this no-brain wash. Well, I thought it could be weak, but I went because of the kids, I thought I could be at least funny. At the end they didn't like it either. I've not read the books (the bestsellers), they are too fat to be valuable, and I think, if you don't know the story you would not understood anything either, no way. I am almost sure, the book could be more interesting, but a movie is not a book and if you try to make it like the book, you lose with no mercy. The movie is an endless cliché and boring to death. The person who plays Harry is the weakest actor I've ever seen, with approximately 3 or 4 grimaces, that's all. There are some freaky teeny love stories, which are laughable, I would prefer ""American pie"" instead. Accidentally I've seen the movie in original, but it was not something adding a value. Actually the people in the cinema laughed almost all the time, I tried to sleep a bit but it was so aloud, so I couldn't. Anyway, a miserable stuff, I'm just wondering how the advertising can manipulate the masses in such a manner. What's a pity!"
231,3,Bad adaptation of a bad book,"By now, my interest in the Harry Potter films is virtually nil, given the rather dull, uneventful, uninspiring nature of the last two entries (Alfonso Cuaron's PRISONER OF AZKABAN being a high point of the series for me). Sadly, when I saw journeyman director David Yates was back for this sixth outing, I expected the worse...and I got it. HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is another messy, pointless entry and a bad adaptation of a book that was already pretty poor in itself. This overlong outing is packed with superfluous stuff, trying to mix world-changing danger and events with typical teenage romance and laughs. The two elements never gel, and you have to wonder why we spend so long dwelling on Ron's romance with an infatuated student when his house has just been burned to the ground and his whole family put into peril."
232,7,VERY VERY VERY disappointing,"OK, after the Order of the Phoenix I read all 7 of the books. After reading or even during reading them I was disappointed with how the movies were made. But this by far was the worst. I even briefly thought about leaving. I can understand not having the Dursleys in. They didn't add a lot to the book anyway and I knew the battle scene at the end was left out (apparently Yates thinks the fans are sooo stupid they would get confused with the battle scene in the next movie) but the rest was just pitiful. In the book where Harry and Ginny kiss was far better. They left out so many of the memory clips and it was a bit confusing (as in what was that ring for...I know but if you haven't read the books you wouldn't)."
233,5,listen to audiotapes of the books....,"Little at a time the movies erode the actual storyline adding more Hollywood's scenes and less of the magic of Rowling's extraordinary books. This was the most disappointing of all the movies so far and I was SO looking forward to it...If people can't bring themselves to read the books (they are large and time consuming), listen to the audio books, especially Stephen Fry's version which will bring so much more to the stories than these movies. I have loved and watched them all over and over and now this one is finally feeling like a movie made from a book...really disappointing and missing the mark. I won't buy this one."
234,8,The return of Harry Potter is much better than expected,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, much like the other films in the series, picks up almost immediately after the events of the last film with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) revealing Voldemort's return to the wizarding community. But despite this ongoing threat, Harry just wants to be a normal teenager chasing pretty girls and spending time with friends. But with Death Eaters trying to break into Hogwarts, and strange occurrences Harry is sure Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is involved with, life is anything but normal."
235,6,The Look of Love,"Let's get it out, it's hard to compete with #3 and #5. Those two films set the standard for what one expects from adaptations of the novel, and ever since it was announced that #7 would be split in two... To be fair, this film isn't bad, but it's not what the book was, and I do understand what ""adapted or based on"" means. It's just that I expect at least the basic storyline to remain in place."
236,1,The worst movie... ever,I have to agree with every one who thinks this movie is the worst thing that happened in HP story.
237,8,"A respectable adapation of the book, but in the end only a prequel to the grand finale!","I always thought that ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was the weakest book of the series, because it just feels like a bridge between Book 5 and 7, that doesn't have anything to offer on its own. The whole plot basically centers around the romantic problems of Harry, Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Dumbledore traveling through memories that involve Lord Voldemort's past. The excitement factor was just absent for pretty much the first 3/4 of the book, and while the final was quite thrilling, it also fell short of some of the others in previous books. Now, with that in mind, I went to see the film with rather low expectations, and expected to hate it and be mad for a long time that they butchered the Harry Potter film series beyond saving. Well, it turns out I was wrong. All in all, the film was a pleasant surprise, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. Was it the worst of the six Harry Potter movies? Probably yes. Is it worth watching though? Definitely! "
238,2,What can I say......,".....it just was really really bad! I love the Harry Potter series and I was really looking forward to see this movie. During the movie I laughed and the dead water-people gave me a good scare, but at the end of the movie I was beginning to wonder what the movie was about..."
239,5,"a for effort: no seriously, where did they try?","I mean it's not an awful movie, (if you think of this film as a standalone). There are moments in it i genuienly enjoyed. However, it is a pretty poor adaptation of the book. The whole 'romantic comedy' addition to it all-meh. For not to mention how the canon endgame ships were pretty much butchered."
240,8,So sorry to say,"I'm really sorry to say this, but I feel, that the director of this movie doesn't have enough talent to work on it. The book itself is so great, actors are amazing, visual effects, music, everything. But all this turns into already second week and boring movie, which leaves no memories or emotions whatsoever."
241,1,Sexist - Stereotypical - With a flawed narrative and cinematic lacking!,"I have never used the phrase 'what a waste of my life' – ever! But here it is ""what a WASTE of my life""! Firstly, I will refer to the above statement and 'obliviously' label the film as SEXIST. I will now accuse it for portraying unfair stereotypical views on teenage-culture."
242,2,Harry Potter and the Half-Baked Plot,"The problem with the Harry Potter books is that the books are too long, the twists are too sudden and convenient. Is Snape a god guy, a bad guy, a good guy, or a bad guy? Rowling makes him to be whatever fancies her at the moment, continuity and consistency be damned."
243,10,Weakest Potter Enty,"Half-Blood Prince is the funniest film in the series. It's well-acted, nicely shot and Dumbledore is wonderful. But as I'm a Potterhead, and as an adaptation it disappoints. Too romance-focused and not enough focus on Voldemort, and it's unfortunate how Ginny is portrayed here."
244,2,Hogwart's Magic Lost,"The magic that is Harry Potter and Hogwart's is completely missing from this movie. There is no suspense in watching it. One should never be watching a Harry Potter Movie thinking about their laundry. I did though. The actors did fabulous, but the story is completely flat. Most our your favorites will be lucky if they get a 15 second cameo. There is no climatic ending. I was actually grateful for the ending, it meant I got to go home finally! The movie is far too long for as little content as it has. I do not mind changing a novel to make it's leap to the big screen, but at least leave enough to remind of us of the original text. This movie kept the names and the places, but very little else. The magic is gone. Let us all hope they find it again before the last two come out."
245,9,Possibly the best one yet!,"They pulled out all the stops for the latest installment of the Harry Potter series and you won't be disappointed with the end result. As a fan of the books and films, I was truly impressed with how The Half-Blood Prince turned out."
246,8,"A great Harry Potter movie for fans, if not fanboys","A reviewer for the Washington Post described ""Half-Blood Prince"" as a Harry Potter movie for non-fans. As a Harry Potter fan myself, I not only loved this film but thought it was one of the best of the Potter movies, rivaled only by the third, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron. The reviewer was confusing fans with fanboys. Of all the movies, this one is probably the least faithful to the source material. It eliminates large sections, makes subtle changes to what it does show, and includes one violent sequence that sharply contradicts the book. Fanboys (who are not, I should mention, all male) are deeply bothered by this, because they want the movies simply to replicate the events of the books on screen. Of course that would be impossible, unless each film was at least five hours long. The best they can hope for is what director Chris Columbus did with the first two films, stuffing as many events as he could manage into two-and-half-hour slots."
247,10,The best of them all,"It's so different from the previous and the last two films, but in the best way possible. We get to spend a last year at Hogwarts with our three heroes and the movie does so well in connecting the dark times coming to the place we're so familiar with. It's darker, more adult but also brilliant in developing and setting the characters up for the final two movies. Love it!"
248,10,"While Lacking In Some Places, Over All It Surmounts All The Other Movies.","*WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*"
249,3,Worst of the lot. Took all the fizz out of the book and served colored sugar water,"I don't understand! What happened to the people who brought us those excellent first four adaptations (I was disappointed with the fifth one too but not as much as this one)!? Did they get themselves a lobotomy or something!? Perhaps the most darkest and excellently put together books of the Harry Potter series, turns out as a movie that is essentially about teenage hormones and unexpected laughs! What happened to all the key plot points that bind together to give us the excellent ending of the seventh series? Where is all the drama, the urgency and the action of the book? Where is the epic showdown within Hogwarts that gets Bill injured? Where is Bill, for that matter!? All the major plot points that add up in the seventh book and result in such an awesome closure of the series are omitted! It is completely mind boggling that so much information can be omitted when adapting the book. I think the filmmakers got complacent and lazy, right from the fifth installment onwards, but watching the level they have stooped to for this one, I am really not that enthusiastic about the seventh and eight movies at all."
250,1,Betrayal -- Is Yates really Voldemort? Is Kloves really Umbridge?,"Sitting there in the dark watching this travesty,I just felt betrayed. It was like a death eater sucked all of the joy, magic and cheerfulness and lets just say it -- logic that should have been present in the movie away. The one star is because it was so hot outside and the theater was air conditioned. This movie is IN-appropriate, IN-excusable and IN-sulting!"
251,1,"""Blameless""","The sixth film of Harry Potter story was damaged by stage director, who added too much from himself to the Harry Potter story from read books. There were so much unnecessary details and scenes (ex: Wisley house burning,etc.). I wonder where are battles between good and bad in the end of the film? Because I think that it is preposterous that death eaters didn't catch Harry to take him to Volandemort when Harry was pursuing Snape alone!!! The romantic story of Harry and Jinny relationship was awful.Harry made the first step, not Jinny was showing her evident sweetheart!! Such scene as lacing Harry's shoes was impossible!What does it mean? Is it how Englishmen show their love? I want to admit excellent play of Rupert Grint and Tom Felton, the best actors from all young actors from the cast. Big number of stage director's gag has ruined all impression from the movie!And IT IS NOT A ROMANTIC COMEDY!!!Harry is sad because his godfather died, the whole magic world is afraid because Volandemort is back, and after all Dambledor dies what makes it even more sadder!! Therefore, I won't lean on a broken reed, 7th film of Harry Potter.."
252,,Very confusing and a total waste of time.,"***SPOILERS*** Okay, let's get one thing over with first. I am not a big fan of Harry Potter books or movies. I've only read up to book 4, since I got tired of waiting for the rest of the books to come out, and when they did I just wasn't interested anymore. Now my interest has suddenly grown, mainly because of this movie."
253,7,Review Harry Potter six,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince's opening scenes are marked by the chaos and confusion permeating both the Muggle and wizard communities as they experience acts of terrorism via Voldemort's army of Death Eaters, free from the shackles of Azkaban and eager to wage war for their master. The fancy of years gone by has been replaced by a general feeling of unease as prominent members of the wizarding world go missing, their businesses left destroyed or abandoned. Rumors suggest Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is getting too old and possibly too senile to offer protection strong enough to defend against The Dark Lord, and parents question whether Hogwarts is still the safest place for their children. Magic has irrevocably made the leap from pretty lights and the odd hex to a weapon of mass destruction in the wrong hands. War, hormones, and dark magic equal a better-than-average year for the students of Hogwarts, and the best Potter movie since Prisoner of Azkaban."
254,1,Harry Potter Gives you the Finger,"HP Giving you the Finger? I was happy to see Wormtail get a little screen time, his part in the book was about as big as his part in the movie. While there are differences in the book version and movie for this scene, there is one glaring detail that both HP book fans as well as HP movie fan can both agree on. We see poor Wormtail is living with Snape, he opens the door to greet Snape's guest and what do we see, a stubby little hand missing a finger wrapped around the door. Wait a second, that was the hand he cut off to bring back Voldemort in GoF, the hand that is now a brilliant silver fully functional hand."
255,8,"Certainly not half-hearted, though possibly half a film...","After five successful instalments of the Harry Potter franchise, The Half Blood Prince follows suit with another magical extravaganza."
256,9,Something awesome this way comes!,"The Harry Potter franchise, like its youthful cast, continues to get darker, seriouser, and more mature. In this sixth entry, Harry has to deal not only with Death Eaters and He Who Shall Not Be Named (coughVoldemortcough) but also teenage hormones, which seem banal to us old folks but rather consume the entirety of the demographic audience's existence."
257,8,not so bad as the haters have you believe,"Having read the reviews of this film, its hard to write a positive review without expecting animosity from the majority. It seems to be more hated than loved thats for sure, and the main consensus is generally because of scenes from the book being omitted which people deem important."
258,1,Smells Like A Stale Cauldron,Sadly after a decade of experience and billions of dollars in revenue the franchise would have perfected its movies - but sadly not.
259,6,Probably the least in the entire series,"THe Half Blood Prince is one of the first movies in the Harry Potter Franchise that I could not get into. I read the books awhile ago, so I don't remember everything, but I do seem to recall that the novel, much better than this movie, had a lot more detail. It seems to me that a lot was cut out. I mean more than half the story. THere is one scene in particular that I do remember however, the final battle sequence, and it was totally cut out of the movie. I cannot accept this."
260,7,my least favorite HP movie,"I still love this movie, but it's my least favorite out of all the harry potters. i hate how many of tom riddle's memories they leave out and how they leave out dumbledore's funeral. i also hate that scene they added where the death eaters burned down the burrow. it was SO unnecessary and added nothing to the storyline. also, this movie has a lot less action than the other movies, which isn't a big problem but at times it gets boring. i feel like they focused way too much on romance drama in this movie (i'm fine with a little bit, but there was quite a lot) and they should've used some of that time to add in a few more of tom riddle's important memories, like how he made some of his horcruxes. those were my favorite parts in the book."
261,1,How Inferi Massacred the Fans,"It is very difficult to write a neutral review of a very pathetic adaptation of one of your favorite books. Yet, try, I shall! For a fan, the movie is torture, but for someone who has miraculously avoided everything potter in the real world and knows nothing about the series, he would definitely enjoy watching the movie once in the theater (especially if someone else paid for the ticket). So what makes the movie bad? Spoiler Alert!! You have been warned."
262,7,Satisfying...but several niggling aspects that drain the energy out of the film faster than a Dementor Kiss,"Even before its release, Half Blood Prince had a dark mark against its name. I felt completely abused after Warner delayed the release. How could they do this to us fans? But when I gaze back into my Pensieve, I walked out of 'Half Blood Prince' satisfied...emotionally. BUT there is still plenty to go all 'Moaning Murtle' over...."
263,8,Bloody Brilliant,I'm aware this is one of the most highly anticipated blockbuster movies of this summer and with those kind of expectations disappointment is almost inevitable. And yet the latest instalment of the HARRY POTTER genre manages to impress.
264,3,Worst of all movies and not even worth writing review,I haven't read the book and according to me this is the worst of all movies till now. Still can't imagine how it took 2 years to make this crap. There is absolutely nothing related to the title and the movie. The producers followed a great marketing strategy as the movie has nothing in action apart from what is shown in the trailers. Hope the future movies do not cheat viewers like me who haven't read the book and would like to enjoy most of the movie. Disgrace to show the death of the great wizard Dumbledore so lame. I seriously think dumbledore himself was so frustrated after seeing this movie that he let him killed rather than continuing in another pathetic movie.
265,9,"Once again I must ask too much of you, Harry","Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again."
266,9,Best Harry Potter Movie to date,"I totally disagree with the bad reviews on this movie. Yes, some plots elements were not in the movie but I think it was a good thing and I did not miss them. The books grew bigger as the series went on, and in fact the last book in so big that they talk of releasing 2 movies to cover it."
267,3,.....Worst one yet,"As a fan of the books I have always been highly critical of the harry potter movie franchise, but I have always been able to appreciate and enjoy the movies even though they may have left out some of my favorite scenes from the books. However, this movie was different. I want to start out with the good by just saying that the acting in the movie is great, each cast member did a great job........but unfortunately that was the only thing keeping this movie afloat. The score was one of the worst I've ever heard in a movie, and the CGI was terrible as well. In the scene where Dumbledore an Harry get the locket, in what is probably one of the most traumatic scenes in the Harry Potter book series, I was left feeling bored, and I almost laughed at how fake the Inferi looked. I felt like I was just watching a herd of Calista Flockharts with bad makeup storming Dumbledore and Harry on the island......it looked ridiculous. There was no build up throughout the movie. By the time Dumbledore's death came along it seemed to just come out of no where and I was just yawning and waiting for it to be over. My main issue was that the movie was ONLY about the relationship drama going on at Hogwarts; it was like David Yates based the movie on an episode of NYC Prep. He completely avoided what the Half Blood Prince is really about.......learning about Voldemort's history and how and why he became who he is. The only thing we learned about him was that he was a bad kid and he created horcruxes, but it didn't really go deep into his character, which I feel was the purpose of the 6th book, not to highlight relationship drama in Hogwarts. Instead of focusing on that drama so much maybe some other parts of the book should have been included such as the other memories of Voldemort? Or maybe the huge battle scene at the end of the book? Or maybe DUMBLEDORE'S FUNERAL?! Overall, I was left questioning David Yates' abilities as a director. The whole storyline was boring, and I have seen Lifetime movies better than this. As I said before, I know some scenes will not be included, and that is fine, I loved the first five movies despite what they didn't include from the books, but this was ridiculous. He left out the scenes in the book that were the exciting parts, and also the scenes that were detrimental to the whole story and paving the way for the seventh book. I saw the movie with some friends who didn't even read the books, and they too just thought it was a bore. Thank you David Yates for raping my favorite story in front of my eyes."
268,6,Unfortunate Title,"It's unfortunate that the title of the book is ""Half-Blood Prince,"" because, really, given what the story is really about, that part was sort of a ""B"" story-line. The ancient textbook was important for the first potion-making scene (Harry HAD to win that Felix Felicis) but after that, it could have very easily been dropped from the storyline. Snape's original ownership of the book, his half-blood parentage, even the Sectusempra spell could all easily have been dropped to make room for more important details, since none of these figure prominently in Deathly Hallows. From the film makers' standpoint, that must have been annoying."
269,,Harry Potter and the Half School Musical - Some Spoilers,After watching this movie I thought Half School Musical was a more appropriate title.
270,10,So disappointing it's surreal,"************SPOILERS*********** I left the theater feeling much like I had after Order of the Phoenix: angry, disappointed and rather bewildered. The fact that I had spent 6hrs in line for this on opening night did little to ease my wretched mental state. There is little to say that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewers, but I wanted to note a few things that annoyed me intensely within this farce of a script: "
271,8,Not that great,"It seems that many people think this movie was very good... I think it was a horrible representation of the book. This is just my opinion, but honestly, I was completely and totally disappointed. The sixth book was my favorite of the series by far and this movie didn't do it justice. It seemed way too obvious to me that they made it more as a build up for the final movies instead of focusing on making this movie more enjoyable. Many people will probably disagree with me but I just thought I'd tell you that if you go into it expecting it to be amazing (like I did), you may be extremely unsatisfied upon leaving the theater."
272,1,The worst Harry Potter Ever...,"I went to watch the premiere show for this movie with high expectations, but ended up with total disappointment. I didn't read the books, so my judgment is based only on a movie with a plot, characters. This movie has nothing with the fact that it is too long for nothing. I kept on straggling just to understand what is going on, which was nothing. For more than an hour and a half, no major progress in the plot, it was only a love story which didn't seems to fit in. You cannot sense the emotions and the whole part was some silly jokes just to make sure that you don't fall asleep. I was amazed to see the number of people leaving the theater. Eventually, it was my part to leave because I felt I am wasting my time because economical report on CNN seemed to be more entertaining!!! I didn't witness the ending, and after reviewing some other comments, I believe it was a correct decision."
273,8,"Finally, a Harry Potter FILM not a collection of memorable book scenes","This is the first film to me that felt like a proper film rather than a collection of favourite scenes from the book, jumping from one to the other and hoping you didn't notice as you kinda enjoyed seeing them come to life."
274,3,Just like the rest of the Harry Potter films...,"Every time a Harry Potter movie opens, it seems the same thing happens: the movie makes a ton of money and gets great reviews. However, I disagree with all of that completely. If these movies were original ideas, based on original screenplays, then yes, they'd be pretty good movies. However, they are NOT. They're based on a series of books that are incredibly well written."
275,10,I Don't understand what others are complaining about,"Trust me, if you choose to not see the movie because of the negative comments you will truly lose something. i am not saying that others reviews are bad, but giving the movie 1 star or 2 stars i simply stupid. If you truly are a harry potter fan you will enjoy the movie, not off course love it, because the movies and the books will always be different, and thats the point!. many people are complaining about how different it was from the book and so on, well, a movie cant be exactly similar to the book, thats why it is callers ""the Movie"", if you want the book then you should read the book. one should think of what the movie contains, not that its not the book."
276,6,Better than the film it's following,"It's a pretty good film, some of the pacing is off and the lore is a bit less interesting than in the other films but the main story is a lot more interesting in this one and it contains a lot of darker elements than the other which tends to help the story."
277,7,"Decent adaptation, but missing just too much. People who hasn't read the book might like it more","This is a very well made condensed adaptation of the book. It seems they know how to make the adaptation better with each installment. Sure it's missing few good parts from the book, but overall it's a job well done. But still audiences that haven't read the novel will probably impressed by this movie, but it is still missing some key parts from the book. I also found it odd how it cut some good action parts from the book while adding stuff in that isn't in the book. I have said this before, but since this is a real build up for the plot for the last movie. It should have had more input with the actual book because of this and cause of other aspects as well. But overall this is a well made movie and a movie those that didn't read the book will probably enjoy. It's just very well directed but could have been better if certain aspects of the book was added in as well. I also liked how the characters almost seemed fully developed and overall I can see why so many people enjoyed this movie."
278,5,The least of the series,"I haven't read much of this series. I have seen all the films and they have made me a casual fan. Upon glimpsing the PG rating for entry #6, I approached with caution. Isn't the series supposed to dive headlong into more perilous territory with Voldemort's return? This film refuses, and what we get in a stellar looking film with very little in the way of direction."
279,5,Harry Potter and the Half fun movie,"I have to say i felt a bit bored during this movie, about 3/4 of the film is about love, which was a lot of fun but uneventful and the history of Voldemort which basically builds up to pratically nothing ! there is no excitement at the end, and the last fight scene and death of Dumbledore was way too rushed. So to me this was one of the films that make me go... that is it ? But still this film had a few positives as well. This is was a more of a different but still unique harry film mostly about love and relationships. The movie spends a lot of time with that so it feels like there is no major threat even though Dumbledore makes it sound big, it lacks in the feel. But the visual effects of the film is outstanding and it is a pretty funny film, but not dark enough to satisfy me. the build up is the stand out point of the film, but the climax was just too short and unfinished."
280,,The Sting,"""In my life I have seen things that are truly horrific. Now I know you will see worse."" Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)"
281,8,The saga thickens up.,"This film is the adaptation of the sixth book in the Harry Potter saga, written by JK Rowling and was directed by David Yates. Always betting on the continuity of its main cast, as well as in the ability of its studios when it comes to special effects and computerization, Yates manages to make a great movie. The script also becomes increasingly complex and dense. The loves and crossed romances will increasingly join the central plot, and that will help to thickens it and make the film more and more adult and mature, deeper and psychologically challenging. The actors will also gaining more and more experience and maturity and will raise their performance to ever higher levels."
282,3,Simply awful entertainment,"Contrary to the generally positive reviews this film has been receiving, I found this to be an awful film."
283,4,Awful,"When i read the book and watched film it was like some passages shown on the film, no attach or no story telling i don't think anyone would understand who didn't read the book. However, Harry Potter franchise is a big one so i think there wouldn't be any man who didn't read the book before watching it. When I look the mechanics of the film, i would say it is just okay because there is no special addition, i think there could be more creative camera angles etc. I give one zero but i can't so give 1. I also sense a lame attempt of humor. I must write absurd thing to fill this goddamn 10 line rule to send my review. So i am going to write irrelevant things. Book, shoe, pencil, cotton, sock, caterpillar, rosemary, flying butter"
284,10,Snazztastic.,"Let's get one thing strait. I walked into this movie expecting to hate it. I was never interested in the books, nor movie series, yet after reading a pretty snazzy review for the film in the paper, I thought that I might as well check it out."
285,4,Not my cup of tea,"As an avid Harry Potter reader, I was left with an empty feeling when I exited the theater. While I had braced myself for possible disappointment after reading about all the artistic changes I knew would be coming, it still did not prepare me for the actual movie."
286,6,An extremely disappointing and actually quite boring film.,"I am not a particular fan of the Harry Potter films, though I love the books. I just feel that they never quite adapted to screen well. The first two films are OK I guess, but by The Prisoner of Azkaban things start to go a bit wrong. The Goblet of Fire is almost as bad but Order of the Phoenix is actually the only one that I think is above average for a film. Because of my enjoyment of the last film I had high expectations for The Half-Blood Prince, however I was very disappointed. For starters it was just boring. What little plot there was in the film was drowned out by the ""domestics"" of Ron and Harry's love-lives (and yes I know that's in the book but I felt that it was too much here). It pottered around for a couple of hours dipping in and out of the plot when it felt like reminding the audience that there is indeed a story. Also, I feel that much of the magic of the first two films has been lost completely now, the darkness of the last film pushed it aside a little, but now it has been lost completely. Finally, when there was actually a climax, it was very weak and frankly I'd stopped caring. I felt that something extra was needed towards the end and I'd lost all interest. The only things worth watching in the film actually are the performances by Michael Gambon, Jim Broadbent, Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, all of which were superb. Worst since Prisoner of Azkaban"
287,1,What a Half Brained Director,"I walked into the theatre thinking, ""Well, I've read the book. But let's keep that aside. I mean the movie has to be crisp."" I didn't expect it to be lifeless, colorless, stupid & idiotic. Let me describe my experiencemaybe that way we'll b on the same note."
288,8,Best in the series by far,"I just saw the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince with my stepbrothers and I must say that I'm not surprised that this one is rated so good. Almost every Harry Potter film I've seen have gotten better and better than the last one. Although the Goblet of Fire is my favorite one out of the films, this one runs pretty close to replacing it. I love how Ron and Hermione's relationship begins to grow stronger and I almost cried when Dumbeldore dies at the end. I think that the Deathly Hallows will be just as great as the other 6 films and I cannot wait for its release this November. The Half-Blood Prince is one of the best in the series."
289,5,My thoughts . . . .,I will start by admitting that I prefer John Williams' music and I am something of a purist when it comes to the story. I went to this film with low expectations and my expectations were met.
290,7,Something is missing but the movie is definitely 'half-full' and not 'half empty'.,I've seen countless of reviews just listing things that was not in this movie. The film and the book are separate. They work differently and have different ways to tell the same story. Do not expect everything in the book to be in this film. I think we said goodbye to that when the Goblet of Fire was over 500 pages long. A movie CAN stay loyal to its source material without leaving out everything. The Half Blood Prince works that way just like any other previous installments did.
291,9,Where was Half-Blood Prince?,"I'm a big fan of Harry Potter's series, and I was so looking forward to this movie! After seen it, I loved it. I loved the chosen actors such as the actor who played Tom Riddle when he was 16 years old, the captions, the scenarios and so on. But when I started to think about the movie as a fan of the book, I wonder ed what have the people that didn't read the book thought of the title: Half-Blood Prince. I think that it was not very well explored, as if it was not important to the movie, I mean, it isn't the most important to the series itself but to this movie, for this story, it was! And the only thing we could see was Harry doing good potions and no mystery beyond the Prince himself. When Snape says he is the Half-Blood prince, it doesn't even make people shocked. I think that it could have been more mysterious..."
292,4,A big disappointment!,"The movie looked from a stand alone perspective is okay, but when you compare it to the book, its one of the worst executions. Many interesting parts from the book are missing, with useless parts from the book added. The director has chosen the easy route, and at the end of 2 and a half hours you feel the movie is incomplete. The scenes which should have been the longest are short, and lot of effort is given to the sub plots, which could have been skipped. In the whole movie nothing really happens, it just drags on."
293,3,The Magic Spell that got F'd Way Up.....,This movie was an incredible disappointment for me and my 10 friends that went. Warner Brothers should be hung for putting this garbage out. The movie is a complete puff piece. It was like watching a G rated version of the movie through cliff notes of the book. 
294,1,Trite and vacuous.,"I Expected this film to be trite and vacuous and I was not disappointed. The acting by Radcliffe et al was wooden and uninspired, and the story-line was infantile. It would not be difficult to make an interesting story out of these characters. It was clearly beyond the abilities of Hollywood scriptwriters. Why does ""World Class"" wizard Potter seem unable to do any impressive magic? He bumbles through uninspiring adventures, only to be rescued with consummate ease by Dumbledore or Granger.We never see him study, or perform any magic of note, yet he is called a ""genius"" on several occasions. I struggled to stay awake while Potter and friends went about their unconvincing business. Avoid this film, or wait for it to come out on rental. The cinema ticket price is not worth it. Dreadful crap...."
295,6,Why oh why...?,"I saw The Half-Blood Prince today after days of nervous finger-biting anticipation bordering on hysteria all of which involved reading the book all over again, snapping at any remotely anti-Harry Potter remark, watching all previews on TV, buying ridiculously expensive tickets to watch the 3D version of the movie etc... I was just extremely anxious to know and once and for all be relieved knowing that the film version of THBP was going to do justice to the novel. I had my reasons to worry... if the film version of 'The Order of the Phoenix' was anything to go by then boy, I had a lot to worry! After all it was the same director and the same team who had successfully managed in trashing probably the most intricate HP book... So, I saw this movie and I'm... well, OK I'm not seething in righteous indignation as some Potter purists might be... but I'm just very disappointed..."
296,6,Disappointing,"This movie wasn't that great. This movie was like a teen drama movie. Having a lot of romantic scene. Audiences are introduced to the ""Half-Blood Prince"" in a textbook near the beginning. But the film forgets Half-Blood Prince's textbook about this for 2 hours until the big reveal. The rest of the plot is twisted with awkward ""love"" sequences, more Quidditch, useless Hogwarts staff, and more world-building. The screenplay shakes from being rushed to being broody at many a time. They should have included some of Lord Voldermort's back story, especially the Gaunt Scene which could have added to his character development. Although its cinematography is really great, acknowleding the fact that the times were getting darker, the climax appears rushed."
297,,Harry Potter and the Half-Done Script - someone needs to elevate this to the level it could be...,"I remember back in August when this was pushed back from Nov to July. Time seems to have been bewitched to pass by us speedily, as the film has been released, and while it is better than than the one before it, Order, I had a sense of how it could've been taken to the next level, largely."
298,4,Boring,"I did not like the movie at all. I am not speaking about the story - the movie itself was rubbish! There were no connections between different scenes, it looked like a collage of separated mini stories."
299,6,How Grand It Must Be To Be The Chosen One,"Harry, Ron and Hermione return to Hogwarts School amid speculation that something terrible is being planned. Dumbledore believes a reclusive former teacher holds the key to the secret, whilst Harry suspects Severus Snape of being in league with the dark forces. Can Hogwarts survive the evil tide amassing against it ?"
300,8,Complete as a movie but don't look as harry stuff,I saw HBP the whole hype surrounding the movie about HBP didn't work well but the movie was good . Good with capturing sound visuals .
301,1,By far one of the worst!!!,"I am a huge fan of the books and I found myself thinking ""what the hell is going on?"" throughout 90% of the film. The worst book to film adaption ever!!!!!!!! Yates and Kloves should be fired and J.K Rowling needs to take more of a hand in the creative choices because these films lately have been lacking. I hated OOTP and I've also not liked GOF but this was a complete and total wreck. I will not waste my precious time and money to see garbage. In todays economy you cannot depend on media hype and good teasers/trailers making a film come off as good by choosing the high points and then showing a complete crap in it's completion."
302,4,Not exactly satisfying,"I will start by saying that if you haven't read the book then you'll be at a total loss when watching the movie. Why? Because much like the previous installment, the Half-Blood Prince feels made from unrelated patches connected in a very loose manner that defies logic."
303,10,Best Potter Yet,"If you have not seen the 6th installment of the Harry Potter series of movies, then you need to see it again, again, and again. With the other 5 movies compared, this one outranks them. I have seen all Harry Potter movies on premiere nights and read all 7 books. But nothing compares to the sheer enjoyment of seeing it first-hand. This movie continues the story of the boy who lived and how he has to face to meet the sticky end and destroy one of the powerful darkest wizards of all time. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson give outstanding performances. My congratulations goes to JK Rowling and David Yates, especially to JK, she has poured her heart out over these books and my thoughts and prayers are with her as continues to write and tell her story the best way she could. When this movie comes out on DVD in December I will be getting it to add to my collection. I give this movie a 20 for great special effects and a great storyline."
304,3,Why on earth are they doing that?,"To all disappointed fans all over the world: Why don't we unite and send Warner Brothers and J.K. Rowling tons of letters each day, where we express our disappointment, that we now twice have been given not the movie we all were expecting? How can J.K. Rowling even agree, that David Yates and the authors are taking every magic out of her creation? Does she even care? What is her opinion?"
305,7,Better watch the film before reading the book,If you haven't read the book (or have kinda forgotten all the details there) you will pretty much love this movie. It appears nicely done and it is fun watching it.
306,1,They did it again.,"The 5 movie was bad enough to fire David Yates and to beg Alfonso Cuaron to come back. It was dull and sometimes really stupid but at least it was a movie about Harry Potter we know from Rowling books and about events which are in HP books. The Half-Blood Prince is not only a cinematographic failure but also is a complete disaster as screen version of the book. The book is simply destroyed. It's some sort of ""American Pie"" with characters named Harry, Ron, Draco etc. It's a piece of fanfiction written by Stephen Cloves and directed by David Yates. Being a huge Harry Potter fan I feel myself insulted by this movie. It seems Worner Brothers decided to make movie so idiotic to test people: is audience still want to see it and will they go to our next violation of HP? I wonder what's next. May be the next movie will be about Harry-Hermione-Ron's menage de trois during their lovely camping when they will be trying to find horcruxes? Of course, if Cloves and Yates would decided to leave such things as horcruxes in their next big thing. May be not. May be it's better just to let characters talk about how Ron is OK with Harry seeing Jinny. Because that is really important things and screw the rest. "
307,10,My Harry Potter Movie Review,"I went to the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. It stayed more true to the book then any other Harry Potter. Some of the others watching the movie, who hadn't read the series but seen all the movies was shocked when Dumbledore died. But we just told them you haven't seen the last of Dumbledore yet and they were happy. I really can't say a bad thing about the movie. I loved it. If I had to pick one thing they forgot to put in the movie would be would the funeral of Dumbledore when the white tomb was created and there was no Krum or Cho. But those are only small tiny things for those who want to be picky. I was extremely happy that the scene from the book where Hermione created the birds and attacks Ron with them when she is upset that he kissed the other girl. Overall AWESOME MOVIE, I plan to go re-watch it soon!!!! It's a must see movie."
308,9,The magic is back!,"My Take: While both loyal fans and non-fans may get picky, this is a good change of pace for the big-screen series."
309,6,The 6th Installment really splits HP fans down the middle...,"Harry potter fans around the world really fall into 2 camps. Those who grew up reading the books then watching the movies; and those who opt just to watch the movies never reading the books. Never before has a Harry Potter film divided these two camps, as is evident from the reviews, so dramatically. If you are a book fan you will be left ultimately disappointed at the lack of loyalty to JK Rowling's original story - especially at the end scenes. However if you are a film fan and have no prior knowledge to the story then I think you will be perfectly content."
310,9,The Best Harry Potter Film Yet,"I constantly and consistently hear complaints from Harry Potter book fanatics about the film adaptions. Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons..."
311,2,How did they manage to ruin one of the most interesting books around?,"People have already said so I'll be brief. This film is so awful compared to the book,i cant believe people love it. The book is a million times better and I'm hugely disappointed."
312,3,It was a teenage drama in magic world.,"It was big disappointment for us.It count me and my three friends, who visited this movie. Movie started with some black fog is going over London bridge, and there is chaos all over.Those are same scenes which you have watched in movie trailers, but those were the only scenes which had some actions in them. "
313,6,Of yawning and snogging,"Don't know how this thingumajiggy mustered 8+ on the reviews. Oh, maybe it was for the teenage audience who are still all a-glee for some snogging. I had to go grab some popcorn and a drink to keep meself awake. The scenes were stretched, almost like a pause after every character speaks so as to make the viewers digest the consequences of such an action. The only piece of action you get my dear friend, is some more snogging. I wish they could have given some more of a role to Carter - what a waste. Once you come out, you can't help but wonder if the movie could have done without H.P. as he didn't do much expect what, a snog? And the H.B.P, well less said the better, as he was a Zero Blood one. So what is H.P. and the H.B.P. all about? Good question and I may have the answer: the movie is lengthy...this helps when you want a nice afternoon siesta and the heat is beating down at you at 100+ outside. 6/10."
314,10,A amazing chapter for the Harry Potter saga.,This movie is really a incredible chapter in the Harry Potter universe. The movie does make a few changes from the book that make more sense and just flow much better. The romance becomes one huge part in this story which really adds more emotion to the overarching story ark. The end of the movie is so amazing. Overall this movie is really a achievement in cinema history.
315,9,Here's the thing...,"Is it the book? No. But by god it's a fantastic movie! Not since PS/SS has a HP movie captured the essence and magic of the books, and is there ever magic! Although some things may be confusing to those who haven't read the books,the movie appeals to all sorts of people, old or young. With a perfect balance of humor romance and darkness."
316,1,HP half blood prince,"--- spoiler alert--- Oke i did not read the novel but after seeing this movie i knew something was up, or rather missing . So i landed here . "
317,8,Full-blooded,"I just saw ""The Half-Blood Prince"" at the end of a week-long viewing of all the Harry Potter movies without having read any of the books (yes, I am the one that is left), and I enjoyed it probably the most of all of this. This loses none of the vast imagination and inventiveness of it's predecessors, and at the same time is decidedly a very still, brooding, tense, and suspenseful film."
318,5,Bad adaptation,Well the thing is the book does a lot of things better than the movie establishing quite a stuff that should have been shown in the movie which wasn shown .
319,,of narrative space,"Who saw and keeps seeing the Harry Potter franchising and thinks a little bit about it knows where it is going to (or supposed to). The franchising is unusually long, for films that work a single story-line, even more when the evolution of the age of the characters matters. It started 8 years ago, it will finish its release (we suppose) in 2 years. So a decade with the same characters. But more, a decade with the same viewers. That's the trick, each film does not attempt to target new audiences, instead it attempts to get the ones who saw the previous films. Of course new publics are welcome, but picking up the regular one (that started in the books) seems to be the main purpose. That's why every film is 'darker' than the previous one, because if the first one was to be seen by someone with, say, 10 years, than the last one should be watchable by someone with 20. It's a clever idea, and which apparently has allowed all the new films to be bankable despite the long duration of the characters. Also, i suppose, that's why Chris Columbus got out of the boat after the third one, he has his imagination shifted into targeting children, and ""families"" in the way. When Columbus got out, they had trouble replacing him, and i think the two previous films are absolute cinematic disasters. The last one, specifically, is a total mess in every respect. Well, Yates must have seen it plenty of times, and made it partially up in this one."
320,1,"A Good Movie, but An Awful Harry Potter Adaptation","As a movie, the film is decent, but as a Harry Potter Adaptation, I think it completely butchered the book. I'm fine with the writers and directors cutting out parts of the book and changing other parts to accommodate for the subsequent plot holes because it is extremely difficult to create a 100% faithful film adaptation. That said, they spent so much time on other things and IMO didn't get those things right. "
321,1,I can't believe J.K. Rowling allowed them to butcher her book in this way,Let's make it short and simple.
322,10,Fantastic!,"Okay...Many hard-core fans have been disappointed with this movie. Why? Because they ALL think it should follow the book EXACTLY the way it was written. I am a hard-core fan, and I love this movie because I see the movies separate from the books. The books are good the way they are, and the movies are good the way they are. I don't compare them because if I do, I know I will be disappointed, and so will many others. I also don't understand how all the haters of this film dislike David Yates...yet they praise the acting. A director is the person who tells the actors to act certain ways, to have certain emotions. To people who think David Yates is a horrible director but thinks the acting is good should all feel dumb. No offence but seriously, people need to get some common sense. Anyways, If you are reading this and you are debating seeing the movie, please go. It was fantastic! Also remember if you are a hard-core fan of the book, do NOT compare it to the movie. Go see the movie to be entertained!"
323,8,The Great Shock finally!,"There is no good audience if there is no love for sudden and big shocks caused by events or action in a movie. The death of the main characters is the best way to do that. When we already know all that, then it is up to the director and screenwriters to make the most spectacular shock. And they succeeded in that. The final scene with Dumbledore's death is perfect. Well done! We are shocked, in disbelief and full of anticipation. That's the effect of a good movie. Thanks JKR for the great character of Dumbledore. We will never forget him. I made this event as a first part of commenting on this piece of Harry Potter because that's what I've been waiting for a long time. Announcing the news that a spectacular finale of this saga awaits us in the best and most striking way possible. The evaluation of the characters has been raised to a high level, the mystique and darling are dominant throughout the film and the wizarding world we are used to is finally more realistic than magical. The insertion of the mystical Half-Blood Prince whose identity is later revealed is masterful. The scene of the entry of Lord Voldemort's followers after the assassination of Dumbledore is great and spectacular. Lots of good scenes and action. Just keep it that way because this movie deserves it. wrote a great book and set a difficult task for the screenwriters and directors to shoot it. I like the plot of the film because it keeps me in suspense and on the other hand it pulls me to think about how this saga could end. There is no need for me to comment on this part of the film in more detail because it is commendable and I want it to remain so because I feel that I will need the strength to comment in the next, final, parts of the film."
324,6,The Movie if hadn't read the books is OK otherwise its crap,The new Harry potter is packed with some good laughs some happy and sad moments and some action. With all that said it was OK. But for someone who has read the book three times like myself the movie was crap it left out several events and some of the more interesting action events from the book. With some of the events left out it will even effect the last two movies of the last book. So it leaves us to wander what will happen with the last movies. I do not know why when u have a great source to wright a script from how you can mess up but for this movie based off a book they did. Many of the important events in the book that were transferred to the film even still were s cued from there original form.
325,4,Too much liberty taken with the book,"J K Rowling really needs to have some stronger input into the screenplays because half of her HBP book is missing from the film version. This film just left me feeling ho-hum. I was expecting to see the big first ""Battle of Hogwarts"" going on while Draco Malfoy, et al, were confronting Dumbledore in the tower. Also, why was Harry cowering down below instead of under his invisibility cloak on the tower - I saw no point at all for that change. In the books, Harry is becoming more and more attracted to Ginny, but is fighting it because she's Ron's sister. In the film, it's as if he's loved her all along and Ron has always been aware of it. But the most glaring omission is the entire Tom Riddle backstory, told as a series of memories in the books and pretty much not told at all in the film. I really wanted to see the Marvolos and Tom's early years at Hogwarts (and, of course, a snake nailed to the door). And, while the book takes great pains to describe how dark Horcruxes are, in the film, there's no real sense that anyone thinks them all that evil. There's too much emphasis placed on the snogging of Ron and Lavender while Hermione can just stand by helplessly. All in all, a very poor adaptation of the book, almost ploddingly executed and a pretty dull film in contrast to a well-paced book. I sincerely hope the Deathly Hallows are better than this one."
326,10,Overall...,"I've been a fan of Potter since I was 8 years old. Every movie I've watched some many times I almost know them word for word and I was really looking forward to this latest film. I went into the cinema knowing that not everything I wanted from the book would be included, it was only going to be ""based on the book"", even so I was really looking forward to it. Personally, I didn't think the (re)introduction of Dumbledore really worked, leaving the Dursley's out was a mistake, but I think Slughorn's entrance was brilliant, as was the previous scene with the Alley and the Bridge. The Twins shop was beyond AMAZING!!!!!! It was exactly how I had imagined it. Hogwarts was amazing, as usual, and I was glad that Quidditch was back in the film, because that was one of my favorite parts of the book... However, I think there weren't enough of the lessons to lead into the next film(s) because if the viewers have not read the the books they may be left confused with the following films. One huge disappoint was the big battle at the end of the film, particularly the stuff with Bill and Fleur... it was needed IMO. Other than that, I really did enjoy it. The cave part was done brilliantly and I was on the edge of my seat that entire time. I should mention the acting of Dan, Emma, Rupert, Bonnie and Tom. They have grown up and matured, and their acting is a lot better now.. (not that it wasn't in the beginning though). All in all... I can't wait for the Deathly Hallows!!"
327,7,"Not as good as it should be, but getting there","This series of adaptations have had quite a rough time at capturing even the core of the books they're based on, nevermind the less essential stuff. This movie is one of the only two I feel manages to capture that core story well (the other being Prisoner of Azkaban)."
328,6,Harry Potter and the Half Ass Film,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is the sixth movie in Harry Potter film series. Too dependent on previous films or expecting the audience to have read the books, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince fails to develop into a complete movie."
329,3,"again, another complainer.","Oh gosh. This movie was seriously lacking. The obviously artificial lighting was so distracting, though I understand Yates was going for ""dark."" There was really hardly any magic in the movie, and maybe the producers and director jumped too fast on the chance to get in some ""romance"" in there, which should've taken the back seat compared to the more important storyline--and way more interesting!--storyline, that of Tom Riddle. It was so choppy, the color palette was so banal, and though the minimal music did a good job at creating that darker atmosphere, it wouldn't hurt to put in a little more to make the movie more engaging! Sometimes the quiet was just too awkward because there was already so much missing from the movie."
330,2,Not great,"Lets face it, films are never ever going to be as good as their books, because books can have so much more detail that films can't have due to time restrictions. "
331,8,Maybe the best Potter movie when viewed independently from the novel.,"And perhaps one of the poorer adaptations. When I watch these films, I do my best to try to watch them completely independently from the books, despite the fact that I have read them all multiple times, as the missing details are always frustrating. In this case, it was a bit difficult to do, as there were seemingly a lot of missing details (some of which are reportedly being shown in the 7th installment, others just eliminated completely for ease and time's sake). If you sit and compare every single detail of the book with the films as you watch them, Half-Blood Prince will frustrate you quite a bit."
332,1,What the Bloody Hell,"Just went and saw ""the half blood prince"" with my partner. I was disgusted with the movie, if id wanted to see some romantic bullcrap i would of watch twilight. I went to see Harry Potter you know magic, the dark lord all that, instead all i got was some pea brained directors half assed attempt at a movie with scenes not from the book added and import parts of the book completely ommitted. I've spent most of the night after the movie trying to explain the movie to my partner who didn't understand why it jumps about so much, why cast are doing certain things (which are previously explained in the book) and why a movie that was meant to be based off one of the best books of the series was so awful. As a loyal Potter fan i hope the final book lives up to the standard of previous movies. For final words id just like to say to David yates (aka the director) Im not angry with you David just very very Disappointed."
333,1,Horrible Movie,"It never happened that i've been falling asleep in a movie theater.. Well, it just happened. Just came back from the play of HP-The Half Blood Prince. After an hour and a half of cheesy college teenage romance i gave up. I woke up at the very end of it and i've never been so happy to leave. Slow paced, out of track and an horrible screenplay for those who've read the book and especially for those who haven't read one of the most exciting book of the series. The book still has excitement throughout all of the story. The movie doesn't at all. At the moment i don't even feel like to trust to go see the very next and last one. After the Goblet Of Fire HP's movies have been going in decadence as far as their quality is concerned. The $10 worst spent for a movie EVER."
334,9,"Entered apprehensive, left pleasantly surprised.","I went to see this having read many reviews--most professional critics were positive, while far more regular viewers were critical of the adaptation. To prep for the movie I re-read book 6 and book 7 last week, and so while I can appreciate that some people are upset at the changes to the details between the book and movie, I thought that the movie DID capture the essence of what the book was about--with the exception of the horcruxes (the details of where and what they were, was explained in sufficient detail in book 6, so that in book 7, this didn't necessarily have to be addressed, however their omission in the movie might mean that they will go into that in the DH-movie). As far as people complaining about the high school-ness of the movie, quite frankly, book 6 was all about the teenager-ness of the main characters (which I think makes their quest in DH that much more impressive)."
335,9,It's a great MOVIE but falls short as a book-film adaptation,Directed by David Yates
336,9,"What up with the hate, I thought it was awesome","Plot: In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is given private lessons from Dumbledore. So as Harry is learning about Voldemort's past, Malfoy begins to sneak off for extended periods of time, trying to carry out the deed, that He who must not be named asked him to do. "
337,10,Dark as I wanted it to be,I literally watched it 10 times and I don't regret! This film has potential and I like it more than I do with other films.
338,1,HP fans,"If you are a fan of HP and haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. Don't even think of watching this one. This movie is surely not meant for HP fans. Its purely for M&B fans..!! I amnt sure why the director got so obsessed with the teenage romance. He shdnt have messed up with this one which is one of the most important books among the HP series. In this book, there is complete change in the life of all the characters and thats hardly brought out in the movie. Dumbledore dies and you don't even feel it..!! So much happens to Draco Malfoy and thats hardly brought out..! The movie makes one feel as if HP is all about romance and that the other things are just ""pass on"" events! Grave grave injustice to the very essence of this book and to the HP fans. I really regret having given my money to this movie by watching it. Real pathetic direction and screen play."
339,7,The great magical divide,"It was only after Sirius Black's death in the previous instalment, the whole of the wizarding community finally believed what Harry Potter had knew all along. Lord Voldermort or the Dark Lord as he is known in the wider wizarding world is well and truly back. The wizarding world is convinced that Harry, who survived the Dark Lord's attack on him when he was a year old, is the 'Chosen One'. "
340,8,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, 2009","I admit, I love the series by J.K. Rowling and collect the 2-Disc special edition DVDs. The Half-Blood Prince is no exception. Though far from a masterpiece but not terrible, this will make a nice edition to the Harry Potter movies."
341,9,The best movie so far,"I actually adored this movie.i guess some people were disappointed because the film adaptation really didn't capture the essence of the book.however,this movie was actually the darkest and most entertaining to watch.i loved how Ron and lavender always made Hermione really jealous and that kind of made the movie have a much better flow.the one role that REALLY surprised me was Draco's.i have always thought he was nothing but a spoiled brat following whatever his dad told him to do,but in this movie we actually got see who Draco really was.i guess all along he hated being a death-eater.that sucks that dumbledore died.that was heartbreaking to watch.well,hopefully the next movie will be as great or better as this one.i recommend it to anyone who Isn't a fan of the books."
342,,"Love is in the air, and Death lies around the bend.",HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is the bleakest Potter yet. Voldemort's army is rising and is on the move. Times are dire.
343,4,Total lack of...,They could have made this movie into one of the best Harry Potter films. Instead they made a mediocre film that lacked emotion. Such powerful and moving parts of the book turned out to be full of nothing but bad direction and awful screen writing. 
344,4,"Has Good Points, but again--WAY too Short","This installment of the cinematic Harry Potter has great cinematography, lush cg effects, good performances, and a great musical score. But as a movie--it's pretty much a failure. Except for the romantic comedy elements (Ron-Hermione and Harry-Ginny) nothing in the film makes any sense. Incidents fly by one after the other with little if anything connecting them. To the viewer who hasn't read--or doesn't really remember--the story from the book, there is no cinematic story to follow. There is only one thing happening after another quickly followed by another seeming unrelated thing followed by another. No image, character or plot element is lingered on longer or shorter than another in this ADD afflicted film, so the viewer can't tell what's important and what's not. The drama is totally lost, making the film feel like nothing more than an extensive highlights reel. Half Blood Prince needed to be, at the very least, an hour longer. In fact, every adaptation from the third film on has needed to be longer as each successive installment has suffered more and more from fractured, cluttered, hard to follow storytelling. The first two films get ragged on by some for being simplistic and old fashioned, but as far as storytelling goes—i.e. involving the viewer in a coherent narrative with a beginning a middle and an end—they were far and away superior films to the rest of the series."
345,4,Poor adaptation of a very good read,"This long awaited film was truly a disappointment and I won't go into detail of the many things omitted since they are well elaborated in the reviews of others on this site. The acting was very good, the visual effects interesting. But for those who have actually ready the books, one is left at the end with: is that ALL there IS? and What happened to...? etc. In every Harry Potter film up to now, there have been significant moments and persons left out. It catches up with the film makers now more than ever with the adaptation of the sixth book and, I would surmise, we shall see how this continues with the adaptation of the seventh and final book. It already has been proposed in two parts and so I could only wonder whether or not this is meant to be more ""faithful to the text"" and/or the film writers/directors/producers are finally now going to fill in all the gaps left along the way. Yes, readers of the books OUGHT to take issue with this film and its very superficial adaptation of a very fine read. I can only wonder what author J. R. Rawlings thought of this and how much input she is given for the film productions. It is noteworthy to say here that, when filming the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, Peter Jackson and his people were very sensitive to those who had read and loved Tolkien's novel (yes, it really was one book). What I see done to the Harry Potter books is nothing short of great insensitivity to the reading public. The film's story line reminded me of the work done by a rather lazy student who had a book report to do and had only skimmed the text. There is little depth, many unanswered questions, characters whose development was left wanting. As I got to the end of the movie it occurred to me that someone watching this who had never read the book would be nearly clueless as to what was actually transpiring."
346,,For better or for worse,"Without Azkaban's intrigue or Phoenix's confrontations, Prince at best ranks a dubious third among the six HP releases, just edging Goblet. After 5 movies in the series, it is really not easy to generate any fresh excitement, and unless you have been hiding away in some tropical jungle when the seventh and last (purportedly) book was release, it is next to impossible that you are not already aware of the outcome in the romance department: Ron with Hermione and Harry with Ginny. Witnessing their development in this movie will therefore bring no more than just a tingle of adolescent joy in you (whatever your real age)."
347,1,absolutely awful!!! beyond words!!!,"This should be worst depiction of a HP novel. I actually felt bored to sit through the movie. So many plot holes and so much disconnection!!! I am fine with change, I don't ask the movie to exactly replicate the book. But the essence should not still be missed. This movie should not be about the adolescence of the characters but the journey into LV's past. How can anyone pull off the next movie w/o actually setting up any key plots needed for it? How can Harry complete his mission in the next part if he never actually saw any clues in part6? People say that we should not be comparing the movie with the book. But how anyone explain the burrow being burnt down? What it its significance in the story? And how corny is Ginny tying Harry's shoe laces. I felt like, where am I? what am I doing here? Even by a teen flick standards, this is bad."
348,3,Warner Brothers dropped the ball...,I'm really glad that people are feeling the same way as me.
349,4,Terrible Harry Potter installment; Decent fantasy movie.,"Perhaps the most important book in the series of Harry Potter makes for the worst film in the saga yet. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince perceives Ginny still as a shadowed character, with Hermione and Ron at each others throats only somewhat and Harry, is not shown as very matured since Order."
350,3,Hugely disappointing,"The fifth movie set a high bar in my opinion because it so well done and well paced. The sixth installment fell flat on its face terribly. firstly the pacing was so unbelievably slow - it took forever for the narrative to progress because it was mired in silly 'teen angst/romance' moments, all of which were severely changed from the book - totally unnecessary. The only time it started to pick up was when Harry requires the necessary 'memory' - and you will have to wait like an hour and half for that. "
351,6,Unjustice to movie done at each level,"Compared to other HP, this movie was least magical to say and was kind of moving too fast. People were led to assume lot of things and I feel it surely wasn't one of the greatest harry potter movie. It was more about snugging and love thing..... There wasn't any magic at all.... I mean how many new things were shown..... Like how they do put unbreakable jinxes on wall or stuffs like that... What happens to Weasley's after there House is burned.....Ron supposedly was sleeping up there.....and I guess he was still up there while house was burning... Quidditch match was great.....but not detailed.....it was like Today we play Quidditch and we won because of Ron...So lets party....all in 5 min may be...."
352,10,Stop whatever you're doing and see this movie!,"The movie can be described in words Ron Weasley can say, ""Bloody Brilliant"" This film is worth the money. The film really balanced the romance and darkness well. For its running time of 2 hours and 30 minutes, it didn't drag and you'll find you're entertained and thrilled. Interesting enough, each scene offers crucial or minor information for the audience to grasp. The story is easy to follow for non-readers. The character-development moments are the best moments. The cave scene is the cherry on the top of this wonderful movie. I had to admit that there were some flaws but no film is perfect, right? The movie will leave the audience desiring for the upcoming sequels."
353,8,More wizarding fun from Harry Potter,"Over the years the Harry Potter series has become a powerhouse, making billions for the publishers and film studios, making J.K. Rowling the richest woman in Britain and becoming one of the biggest film series ever. With Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince director David Yates offers Harry Potter fans a fine addition to the series (but not as strong as his previous attempt Order of the Phoenix)."
354,5,"This Movie Isn't Sleepy, It's Very Sleepy !",Being in the theater with this movie was a disastrous experience. I wanted to leave at least 6 times. It was nearly unwatchable and totally uninteresting!
355,3,Tragic and awful movie barely saved by brilliant acting,"I was 11 when I read my first Harry Potter. I have stood in queues at midnight waiting to buy the books. I have seen the previous movies and, though not completely impressed, I appreciated the effort that was made to bring the story to the silver screen."
356,,a great setup for the next chapter,"The magic is back in this entertaining sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. Young Harry is growing up, but still has a lot to learn as he walks the path of the ""chosen one."" Dumbledore recruits former colleague Professor Horace Slughorn to teach at Hogwarts in the hopes that his young protégé Harry will be taken under his wing. Harry discovers a mysterious book marked property of the Half-Blood Prince and enrolls in Slughorn's class, but the more Harry learns from the eccentric professor, the more he also learns of the treacherous Voldemort's dark past. Like most of its predecessors it's pretty long, yet richly detailed and charismatically performed, with a surprising sense of humor, and a story that holds you right until its exciting conclusion. A major improvement over the Order of the Phoenix, and effective in creating anticipation for the next installment. ***"
357,2,Comment / review from a non-reader of the books,What a mess! Dead-ends and utterly pointless turns en mass. 80% of the movie is a romantic comedy with random plot gems trying to push through. Stellar acting and cinematography is completely wasted.
358,10,Alan Rickman steals the film,"Yes, this sixth chapter is a darker, more ominous Harry Potter film, with a conclusion that suggests more alarmingly the deep dangers Harry and his friends have gotten themselves into. There was always a disconnect between Harry's enchanting school days at Hogwarts and the looming threat of Voldemort. Presumably it would take more than skills at Quidditch to defeat the dreaded Dark Lord. In one of the opening scenes, we find Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) late at night in a cafe of the London Underground, reading a copy of the Daily Prophet which poses the question: Is Harry Potter the Chosen One? By the film's end, he acknowledges that he has, indeed, been chosen to face down Voldemort (whose name should properly rhyme with the French word for ""death,"" mort; also, since their word vol can have meanings such as ""thief"" and ""steal,"" Lord Voldemort is most ominously named). Harry is distracted from his paper, however, by an instant flirtation with the young waitress, a saucy cutie who informs him, although he asked only with his eyes, that she gets off work at 11. She indeed waits for him on the platform, but the Chosen One must respond to his higher calling from Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), who either materializes, gets off a train, or has a pied-a-terre right there in the Underground. I for one will be disappointed if that waitress (I think her name is Elarica Gallagher) doesn't turn up again in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" whose two parts will conclude the series in 2010 and 2011. Some of these characters are reprised just as reminders. The giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), for example, turns up primarily to allow us to observe, look who's turned up! Snape, as played by Alan Rickman, is given much more dialogue, primarily I suspect because he invests it with such macabre pauses. Radcliffe's Potter is sturdy and boring, as always; it's not easy being the hero with a supporting cast like this. Michael Gambon steals the show as Dumbledore, who for a man his age certainly has some new tricks, so to speak, up his sleeve."
359,1,"Waste of Time, Money, resources and talent","This is the most awaited movie of this year but problem with is that it's a senseless film. Totally deviated from the original story, and trying to make a youth generation movie. All the actors are acted well but there dialogues are senseless. I Liked the other previous series of Harry potter and previous ones are really fantastic. When this movie started, I thought now something exciting scence will coming,ho ho ....waited and waited. But they are all trying to concentrate more on parties and love stories, no real deal of harry potter adventure, they have too much prolonged unnecessarly. This movie represents lack of imagination, and seems like director was in too much hurry. The film has 'A' class production value, but script wise, its a complete disappointment. The movies is high production and people will see with high hopes, but unfortunately going to bring disappointment. inspite over all these this movie will be hit, because name of harry potter will be enough, and I think its a important part of the series which links the other upcoming series. Hope they don't do the same mistake with other upcoming parts."
360,8,"Wonderful sizzling darkness, but too much teen romance.","I went to see HP and the Half-Blood Prince on Friday night. I did enjoy it, seeing it in a crowded cinema, with many teens and kids in eager attendance. I think it's the best movie in the series so far, and the director David Yates is certainly a competent man. The start of the movie is spellbinding as dementors ride through the West End and whoosh over the Millennium Bridge. It's simply exhilarating. Also, later, there are some fantastic, dark scenes, all of which Helena Bonham Carter as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange steals. She's like a black cat, hissing and dancing away, an electrifying performance. To see her hiding and leaping in the cornfield, and destroying the venerable dining hall are cinematic moments to treasure and remember. Alan Rickman as Snape is also better than ever, expressing so much just via the pauses in his speech, and slight altering of tempo."
361,6,"In one word, mediocre (minor spoilers).","This installment of the series felt very similar to the fourth part, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""; plot was sacrificed on the altar of light entertainment."
362,6,"Mediocre, at best",Mediocre.
363,7,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Sets the Finale,This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.
364,7,The Series is Back on Track,"Perhaps I should begin by pointing out that, unlike many reviewers, I have not read J. K. Rowling's original novel. I am, therefore, unable to comment on assertions that the film is not true to the spirit of the book or that it omits many of its best episodes."
365,1,Worst movie in the series,"I don't know the HP books, this makes it probably easier for me to be forgiving about everything that's left out. Unfortunately enough despite this I did not enjoy the movie one bit. In all the other movies there were really at least as many nice episodes/details as to make the movie enjoyable overall. This one is the exception: It is not really fun. Taking into account that I do enjoy fantasy movies a lot and typically rate them higher just because I like the genre, I really think that this must be one of the year's worst movies if you are not a HP fan or a sucker for fantasy ... On the positive side: It's most frustrating when a series ends with the worst movie. In this case that is almost impossible :-)"
366,3,A mess,"What a mess!!Not worth seeing,not even comparable to the book. HP6 is my favorite but that movie messed it all up. Awful plot,almost no events and not related to the book.HP5 film sucks but it was bearable but the next one is too much."
367,1,It don't get any worse than this!,"I'm speechless. This film was simply awful, worse than 'Phoenix'. I watched it with my younger cousin and it was hard for both of us to try and keep paying attention (I've read the book twice and he dozens of times). The whole movie was dull - dull acting (words can't describe Radcliffe's horrible acting (or should I say moaning, cause that's all he's good at)), dull story (screenplay to be exact), dull 'action scenes', dull villains and dull everything. Key elements from the book are cut and replaced with new lame and unnecessary scenes, such as cheesy jokes and everybody's favorite 'hormones'. Music was out of place - BRING WILLIAMS BACK! And while I'm on it - GET RID OF YATES for god's sake (but of course not, they've already signed him on for 'Hallows')."
368,8,maybe the best Potter Movie,"I loved this movie honestly. The third may still be my favorite, but this movie has a lot going for it. It had some good camera angles and shots that made me happy. I guess what makes this a good movie is that it worked as a movie and did not try to put too much from the book in and make it feel too disjointed. The best thing about this movie is that for once the kids felt like the kids that they actually are. They feel like teenagers dealing with lots of different issues and teenagers deal with. I do not mind that that moved up certain romantic aspects of the book, because it felt right. I think the entire cast really came around and gave some top notch performances even with minimal screen time. I love the casting that they manage to pull off even though they get so little screen time. I love what Maggie Smith did with her few scenes especially the end. I really felt the emotion of the loss at that moment. Rickman gave his best performance as Snape and those that know how the books end have the pleasure of recognizing how good his performance is and what a tough job he has. I still love Luna Lovegood and she was as quirky and perfect as always. Also some great casting of young Tom Riddle. I think overall this have the best performances of the entire cast with a few exceptions. Hagrid did a great job in the first and third movie and did not get a lot of screen time here. This might have annoyed some of the audience, but I love how they put in Remus and Tonks relationship in the movie in the smallest way but did not put any focus on it. It gives us an idea of that real people with real relationships are at stake here. I might not like how some of the side cast did not get bigger moments especially the other students, but I would rather have a coherent movie that a bunch of random moments strung together. I did have to say I think the music was overpowering at moments, but the lack of music in the last scene was nicely done. I think Yates did an excellent job and have high hopes for the last (two) movies."
369,8,from a guy that haven't read the books,"i haven't read the HP books. not one. i think i just don't like the books very much. too many pages for me, and its just not my subject to read about. the movies are different. i like the movies very much."
370,7,"Might have fall short, but nonetheless enjoyable",I do think the love romance comedy in the middle could have been shortened to make room for more plot development of Tom Riddle and his death-eaters. 
371,6,spoiled popcorn,"This attempt was like being in an ER and seeing someone being given CPR. You wait and wait for the beat.. a pulse... a sign of life... and instead you get a big ol_____________________________________flat line. No excitement to be found here I'm sorry to say. Besides not including a lot of the elements essential to the story line. They just didn't progress the story very much at all. We know Dumbledore is dead, Harry, Ron and Hermione are going to search for the horcruxes , and everyone is in love. It is a truly sad interpretation of the book. I agree with an earlier poster...We need a redo! Call it a Mulligan and try again. If this is what Yates has in store for us for DH part 1 & 2 then this will be a really sad ending for what started out as a great effort to bring such a wonderful series of books to life. Being loyal fans we deserve more. The characters, the actors and JK deserve more. Much much more than this lame attempt by Yates. I read some poor reviews of the movie before seeing it and just did not want to believe it. Well I can tell you it's all sadly true. Of the series this is by far the worst! I think I'll read the books again to get the taste of spoiled popcorn out of my mouth."
372,9,One of my favorite Harry Potter Films,"This is my favorite because we get to explore the relationships of all the actors more in this story and (spoiler) Hermione and Ron show more feelings to each other. I like that we get to see Harry use liquid luck potion, I love the addition of Professor Slughorn. Spoiler Warning: I also love that we get to see more of Voldemort's back story and see him become the person he is today. This is a dark film but there are also very heartfelt and sweet moments as well. You get to see Dumbledore and Harry's relationship grow as well. There are some funny parts in the movie as well. Overall, I would say this movie has great acting, great heart and the ending is so great and powerful! :)"
373,2,Good Acting... Horrendous Reenactment...,"I felt the movie was good but only if you did not read the book. The last movie to me was much better at connecting you with the characters. Some of the scenes left viewers confused at what was going on and why. Also the lack of details and changes to the original story are what killed it for me. (I.E: JK Rowling described the skull above the castle as a ""blazing green skull with a serpent thong"") details like that are what make the made the Potter series what it is. I am not saying I wouldn't recommend the movie just if you read the book please don't get your hopes up. The book and the movie are different in so many ways."
374,3,what the hell?,"I recently viewed the film ""harry potter and the half blood prince"" and found it extraordinarily painful to sit their and listen to the crap which was going on. HoNESTLY THOUGH, just look at the whole picture,......., what was that all about, and then i realised...., that film was made to kill off dumbledor, the film just went on and on, and as i believe harry potter reached his prime in the other films. Of which, he is and always will be unable to fulfil again, and again, the movie lasted for 2 hours and 33 minute's, it is almost as if the movie was just being made because it needed to and not because anyone wanted it made. ------- the best part of that film was leaving the cinema----- and i hope i never see that dreadful, endless, and extremely boring film, ever, ever, again!. It would literally be torture."
375,9,Severus' genius,"This part for the 1st time shows the most awaited chemistry between Ron and Hermoine. Also the Love of Harry for Ginny is made explicit. The battle has begun between the death eaters and army of Dumbledore. Malfoy gives for passage for death eaters and Severus kills Dumbledore. The most interesting part was the revelation of Severus Snape as the Half Blood prince. An elegant combo of love, fantasy and action was seen. Lastly the demise of Dumbledore was the most heart touching part."
376,4,"Loved the books, loved the first 5 movies, HATED this one.",What do you get when you remove all of the intensity of the book? When you try to make a comedy out of a drama? When you add unnecessary scenes when faced with converting a 650 page book into a 2.5 hour movie? When you have a breathtaking last 50 pages of the book that is boring and flat when put on screen? When you have the chance to show why strange things are happening but instead just slap great special effects on a sloppy script? When your new red-headed leading lady can't act but you are stuck with her because she was cast in the role 7-8 years ago? You get Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.
377,9,Wonderful adaptation that brings the comedy and magic back,"Girls, Quidditch and a mysterious potion book distract Harry Potter (Radcliffe) from the dangerous events outside Hogwarts whilst Dumbledore sets him a difficult task."
378,9,After all the OOTF disappointment...,"I really liked it, but I gotta say that David Yates (or maybe Steve Kloves) has failed about crucial details, especially in the Room of Requeriment scene (with that AWFUL kiss, that I'd have done way better if I were that close to Daniel Radcliffe), when Harry or Ginny HAD to see Ravenclaw's diadem, even if it was just for a second. And where the hell went Harry's chemistry with Ginny? "
379,1,Horrible film,"Not sure what the point of this was. A movie, a story, needs to be about something, this wasn't. Whoever did the screenplay should never be paid for another."
380,8,A darker Hogwarts and much the better for it.,"Dark, atmospheric and offset at points with comedic respite David Yates after his excellent Order of the Phoenix, turns out a fine spectacle with The Half-Blood Prince. Yes the Half-Blood Prince misses large pieces of the book, and yes I was not happy for it to lose so many memorable moments but as a piece of film it really does impress."
381,3,incomplete and disjointed.,"I, along with thousands of others, saw Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince at a midnight showing and all I can say is that I left the theater feeling cheated out of ten dollars and a proper climax. For anyone's who has read book six, you know there were many important scenes left completely out of the book. Instead these important scenes were replaced with ridiculous, although sometimes funny, love triangles and awkward teenage crush scenes. What was the point? I just kept feeling like Harry Potter had all these childish scenes just to target their young audiences. I felt the movie started to revolve more around Ron and Hermione and Harry And Ginny then Tom Riddle's past and how it is affecting everything in the present."
382,8,Simply irresistible.,"Being a hard person to please when it comes to movies, this one did rather well. There were points where I said ""Wha'"" or ""Heeeehh?"" but there where only a few of those. There were definitely some parts that did not exist in the book, and parts that they left out from the book. There will definitely be some confusion in the duration of the movie for those who have not read the glorious book, but I heard somewhere that JKR knows what she's doing and it will be made up in the last/last two films. I could have heard wrong, or right. The actors again were a delight. Harry may go out of character for a while, but I promise it's pretty funny. The new Horace Slughorn (Horace is such a great name, by the way), played by Jim Broadbent, was entertaining. The romance and age in the movie were probably much more emphasized than the Tom Riddle's secret. Did I mention unnecessary additions? I thought they could have done without those and put more from the book in. I may sound repetitive, but that is the only downfall in the movie. Overall, being a Harry Potter fan, the movie was simply irresistible. Enjoy."
383,10,TRYING to like the film,"I have to say, after I watched OOTP, my initial reaction was ""I MUST WATCH THIS AGAIN RIGHT NOW!"" I was extremely confident that the following films are in good hands. HOWEVER, HBP was fast paced- but moved so quickly that I felt like I was being rushed from one scene to this next. Additionally, although the scenery was quite beautiful, there were many parts when the CGI just seemed too fake. On another note, I will get down on my knees if I have to in order to beg Yates and Heyman to put ROBES on the trio! Please! You wear robes at Hogwarts- not Muggle clothing! You wear robes in the Wizarding world! I beg you. This isn't a very difficult thing to accomplish. As for the score, I must say I am slightly disappointed. I loved Nicholas Hooper on OOTP. Unfortunately, is it just me or did I hear the same thing at Fred and George's joke shop? I head some beautiful tracks on the trailer that I'm not sure I heard in the movie. (But I could be wrong.) On the other hand, the acting was superb- with the exception of the despicable, ignorant Michael Gambon and Jim Broadbent. The trio's acting has improved immensely, and I am grateful for that. Alan Rickman's interpretation of Snape and Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix are both incredibly amazing. They have nailed their characters. Regrettably, I must say even though Broadbent was not a complete failure like Gambon, I wish he played Slughorn better by really obsessing over Harry and people with famous relatives. (SPOILER) I especially was disturbed at the part when Ron was poisoned, and Slughorn just stood shocked by the side and did NOTHING.! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Harry saved Ron! WTF! While Harry did yell, ""Professor, DO SOMETHING,"" in the novel, Slughorn did react! Now, onto Gambon. I never quite got over Richard Harris' death, but that's because Gambon is an EPIC FAILURE. (SPOILER) Once again, he showed the ""angry"" Dumbledore, which is non existent in the books, when he yelled at the students ""Get to bed!"" Dumbledore would NEVER say something like that! Alright, now onto the events... (SPOILER for the rest of the paragraph) I am so disappointed by the stuff they cut out. First, I must state that, obviously, I'm always disappointed by stuff cut out in the films. However, I could understand most of the stuff the previous films cut out. As for HBP, I have never been so appalled. I fail to see how burning down the Burrows helped ""advance"" the plot. It was an unnecessary addition, which the timing could have been used to better the non-existent climax. The ending was appalling as well. Why wasn't Snape angry when Harry called him COWARD! Instead of having so much romance, film makers should have focused more on the Half-Blood Prince. Have Hermione yell at Harry a bit more for using the Prince's book! And why is the invisible cloak non existent except for on the train in the entire movie! You need it for Deathly Hallows! Plus, Harry's character would have never stood by if Dumbledore's disarmed and Bellatrix and Greyback were in the same room! Speaking of Dumbledore, HOW THE HELL CAN HE APPARATE IN HOGWARTS! WHAT A LOAD OF BS! They didn't even explain Greyback as well! Plus, Tonks and Lupin's relationship were never explained so why did Tonks call him sweetheart! If you're going to leave Tonks and Lupin's relationship out, FINE! But don' have her do something random like that! Next, Harry and Ginny's kiss There's only one word to describe that. PATHETIC. Simply pathetic! Oh, and why was Harry's Quidditch captain position not explained?! Why was he lacking in leadership during tryouts! Harry always shows leadership! The DA for example! Why was Ginny standing by his side! She needs to try out as well! Oh, and the Horcruxes Remember that! Was that, what, only briefly mentioned?! How can they advance the plot in DH if Harry doesn't know SH** about the Hufflepuff cup, the Slytherin ring, etc.!!!! And Sirius's will!!! What the hell was the point of including bloody Kreacher, who had one line, in OOTP if he wasn't mentioned to be inherited by Harry. Sorry, that all of these events are not in chronological order. But back to Dumbledore Why am I not surprised that Dumbledore's death was not depressing? Oh hmm maybe because the actor who played Dumbledore said he wasn't sad when filming the scene!!! Fine, if you don't want to include the bloody funeral. But PLEASE, make the death sad!!! And since you didn't include nothing about Dumbledore's wand, please remember it in DH. And why didn't I hate Snape at all like I did after reading HBP! Another comment on the romance, Ron and Hermione's wasn't awkward enough. There just wasn't the right transition. And WHY did Lavender Brown sit at another table with other GRYFFINDORES in the Great Hall after her and Ron broke up? There four tables in the great hall and they are seated by the order of the four Houses! Why are there Gryffindores on two separate tables? What the heck? And Neville! Why did he only have one line! I would like to see less of that dimwit Lavender Brown! And how did Lupin know about Draco's mission?! Speaking of which, I finally have one good thing to say about the film. Tom Felton was amazing. They did Draco justice- although I would have hoped Sectumsempra (Sorry, if I didn't spell it correctly) was a little bit more dramatic. After all, it is of the Dark Arts. It would have been better if we could have seen gashes on Malfoy and blood spilling out as Harry waved his wand wildly like he was supposed to though the battle was not bad. But speaking of battles, taking out the ending battle was the worst idea Yates ever had."
384,6,...Where did they go wrong,This movie is good...for a movie. But in the Harry Potter franchise it just doesn't cut. Most of the movies haven't. I am an avid reader of the books and I go to every midnight showing. I read the books at least once a year. When I saw the trailer for this movie was super psyched. It looked as if they had finally gotten one right. It looked brilliant. I came out of the movie not knowing what to think. I know that it's not possible for them to put everything in...but not to put some stuff in and then add some completely unneeded scenes is just upsetting. The burrow scene was useless.
385,3,"A middle, middle, and a middle - and a disappoint middle at that.","I enjoyed parts of this film, an I wanted to give it a higher grade, but I just couldn't make myself. I've never read the books and have never wanted to until now - and the *only* reason that I now want to read the last book is because this film just leaves you hanging, without satisfaction, closure, or ending. It reminds me of the first Lord Of The Rings. I could even hear, ""I'll come with you Mr Frodo!"" in the closing moments. ""And you can have my sword!"" ""And my shield!"" ""And my bow!"" And a quest of all things? I'm sure it'll be a very good and interesting quest. But from this series I kinda expected something a little less . . . mundane."
386,8,Teenage romcom and doomic thriller go head-to-head in this summer's number one blockbuster.,"Is there vital killings in Harry Potter's sixth adventure? Will (the great) Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort curl like a serpent and encompass the screen with his full evil glory? Will Daniel Radcliffe ever learn proper acting and hold the spectacle together as the heroic character he portrays? Will director David Yates put away all that schoolyard-nonsense once and for all and start making a thriller? Some of these questions will be answered, and some not, in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."
387,8,Atmospheric darkness & emotional intensity result in one of the better entries of the series,"While Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince still utilizes cheesy teenage romance scenes and subplots like the previous entries in these series, it is undeniably dark, much darker than its predecessors as every single scene seems to feature low key lighting which further enhances the onimous feel we get after watching the more serious scenes."
388,9,Easily the best film in the series,"Having recently watched the first five films again, I have to say that I have slightly mixed feelings about the Harry Potter film series as a whole. The first three, while still solid films, are not nearly as ""amazing"" as I remember them being (though Prisoner of Azkaban comes pretty damn close). Goblet of Fire, however, is much better than I remember it being, and part five, while not as brilliant as its predecessor, is definitely among the series' best. So, despite being a huge fan of the last few books, I've never particularly loved any of the Potter films, with the exception of the fourthand now the sixth."
389,10,Great cliffhangers in the end - damn I can't wait to see the next part,"I didn't read the books, but I have to say, that this movie didn't seem to me like it was missing any key points. I had that feeling in several other parts, but not this one. - Which really confuses me, because other reviews say the opposite thing. The people who claim this, actually read the book, and say, that a lot has been left out, and even changed. I don't know if it's true, but trust me, if you don't know the books, this movie still makes sense totally. It is one of the greatest parts. Especially if you like the direction into that Harry Potter is going. This movie is as dark as the 5th part. - I love it, and hope that the 7th part will be even darker. The atmosphere is great, and I am glad that Dumbledor finally had a bigger role in this part."
390,10,Rocked my multi-colored neon socks off!,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best movie so far. In fact (I know this is totally sacrilege) in many ways it even surpasses the book.
391,7,Probably the worst Harry Potter movie,"As the title says... this is probably the worst Harry Potter movie. It didn't make justice to the book: most of the time it was focus on Ron and Lavender ""romance""; I personally hated this green and gray and blurry effects, even when it wasn't about a dream or a memory they used those effects! Also, I didn't see too many magic things happening in here, it's like I didn't really feel this was Hogwarts. There were important things in the book that in this movie they just ignore it. I don't think this is a terrible movie but definitely not great."
392,9,Probably the best of the series,"I found this film much, much better than the fifth part. I did not like the fifth one mainly because the action seemed a bit silly. And even though this movie too has its problems, its still very likable due to its story and its acting."
393,6,Enjoyable but Slow,"I obviously did the 'HP experience' the right way. Watched each movie and then read the book. So I didn't get upset about how much of the book was missing from the movie. However I found it hard to follow some of the dialog and was forced to watch the film on DVD with sub-titles to get everything said. And it was much slower paced than the other films. That said I did enjoy it. **** Here is the spoiler**** While I am sure Dumbledore is dead, I couldn't imagine a situation more asking for him to actually be alive if the author wanted him to not really die. A master wizard (albeit tired) was disarmed by a 15 yo student, then fell off a tower, and his body was found later at the bottom of the tower. Hmmm... How hard would it be for a little confusing magic to make it seem he was disarmed, or even a fake wand? Dumbledore falls to his death? How ... ordinary. He couldn't use a float or fly spell to survive? And then in the 15 minutes between falling and his body being discovered it wouldn't be difficult for a master wizard to provide an artificial substitute. But.. as I said, I am sure he is dead, killing off important secondary characters in the second last book is a well-established literary technique. The use of the liquid luck potion was cute. A good way of allowing the writer to move the plot along without having to think up a reason for Slughorn to tell Harry the secret memory. But once you have opened the 'luck potion' box it can be a problem. How does harry defeat Voldemort? Well lets drink a large potion of 'liquid luck' and start writing random letters. Look, what luck, Harry has written a complete plan to defeat Voldemort without anyone dying or even being badly hurt. 'Wasn't that a stroke of luck'. Of course people will argue that it is not that powerful, but the point is that it can be argued. Until JK Rowling brought up the liquid luck potion, Harry and his friends had to succeed or fail using their skills, knowledge, friends, and a little ordinary luck."
394,4,One of the worst adaptations I've ever seen,"I will keep this review short, sharp and to the point. The sixth Harry Potter book is by far my favourite, with a nice balance of story, character building and action. This movie, however, is probably the one of the worst of the movies. Despite the entire cast giving great performances and the usual excellent special effects and score, the story was appalling, with so many vital points omitted and needlessly changed. So, to put this simply: fans of the book will come out sorely disappointed and fans of the movies will come out happy, but slightly confused. The pacing is all over the shop, most of the movie just jumps from scene to scene until the last half hour in which everything slows down for awhile."
395,9,A Welcome Return to Form for The Series,Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince is the best Harry Potter movie since the Prisoner of Azkaban. The movie incorporates the main themes of the novel while leaving out some minor details. Alan Rickman's turn as the morally ambiguous Snape is a joy to watch as he portrays the conflicting emotions of his character with great finesse. 
396,,Satisfied at last,"I'm a Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books and enjoyed them immensely. I was thrilled with the first 2 movies, feeling they were true to the book and well done. With the 3rd movie, however, not only did I suffer the loss of Richard Harris, who was the epitome of the wise, venerable, Dumbledore who commanded authority quietly - but the entire film style also deteriorated. The 3rd, 4th and 5th movies were so disappointing, with the jarring, disjointed film style and the growling, sergeant-like portrayal of Dumbledore. Even Alan Rickman's phenomenal acting skill was obscured. I considered not even watching ""The Half Blood Prince."" However, I took a chance and bought the movie to watch."
397,8,A Good Follow Up To A Good Series of Fantasy Yarns,"Entertaining, a good follow up to Order of The Phoenix, and amusing are the words I would use for the Half Blood Prince. Because it is thoroughly good if not better than the first three films of the series as it grew darker and more deeper. Good cast, good action, good moments and some bad I will admit. But well worth the price I paid for my ticket, I like the films but I am not an avid fan if anything of the books or franchise. More of a Star Wars man myself, but I do like them."
398,3,Worst of the Bunch.,"I've never felt compelled to write a review until now. This movie left me so empty that I almost walked out before it even really finished. To take the words from other reviews, this movie was soulless and anti-climatic. The movie makers chose to emphasize the wrong side of the story. It felt more like a teen love/sex comedy than a Harry Potter flick. The hormones were played up, while the Voldemort back-story felt more like an afterthought. Even the ""memory"" of when Dumbledore meets Tom seems irrelevant because it doesn't really explain much. It doesn't explain Tom's pain and awkwardness and doesn't really set the stage for who he becomes. We don't learn anything about his parents or his family, which, to me, is an important element in his becoming Voldemort."
399,9,"The darker, though the lonelier the movie appeared more closer","I never broke my habit of watching Harry Potter movies the time they became available in theaters. For its recent movies indeed warner brothers had made its integrity solid and best in the film industry. They say the farther the movie gets into the more it gets darker. I appreciate well how they have depicted Order of the Phoenix in the big screen. I wasn't disappointed on the other hand how Half Blood Prince appeared to lack with action, but then it had served its purpose to real viewers who knows how to understand the film's crew's intention of bringing it into theaters. The HBP centered much of course on the revelation of Voldermort's past, how it played well to Harry and Dumbldore's quest of defeating him. Most of his memories had given Harry what Voldermort had done to him and at the same time served as a clue for them in defeating the dark lord. The film most of my friends said had indeed departed so much with the book. I believe however that the writers had done well, and I also had faith that this would go well for everything written and made for the Harry Potter movies got approval of J.K. Rowling herself. I got the speculation that they are recovering for their extreme budget expenditures from Order of the Phoenix, since it indeed involve wizardry battle of elite level. They had to limit it and found a leeway of depicting into the screen HBP into a revelation rather than battle-packed episode. I got faith on the Harry Potter movie crews for creating the final movies in the future as good as its viewers expect. Nevertheless, HBP had been depicted beautifully and I really appreciated well how they portray the true intention of the book to the viewers."
400,2,By far the weakest of the lot...so far.,"Half-Blood Prince By far the weakest of the lot...so far. For someone that has not read the books, but have only followed the movies, this still seemed away too predictable and 'long in the tooth' Star Wars clone for most. I myself thought it so and most of the people I know that have read the stories found it well below the standards set by the previous outings. "
401,1,"A box office smash, but FLOP to HP fans around the world","Though HBP, the sixth installment of the Harry potter series, hit the box offices like a tidal wave, it left many fans of the book series by J.K. Rowling extremely disappointed. The cinematography and effects were outstanding. However, Many facts and events that are crucial to the storyline, such as Harry and Dumbledore's ""lessons"" which explain the horcruxes and the reasoning behind Tom Riddle's choices for them, were left out of the film. Scenes were added into the film that never happened in the book and proved to have NO significance to the storyline Such as the Christmas scene at the burrow with LeStrang. If the makers of this film were so keen on adding action scenes into the movie to keep it moving, then maybe they should have thought about the huge fight scene with the death eaters at Hogwarts on the night of Dumbledore's death, which actually did take place in the story. At the end, Harry picks up Dumbledore's wand from his desk, which anyone who read the books knows that it was with the headmaster in his grave. This is ,unfortunately, a major error made in the film will make it almost impossible for the final chapter to come to the big screen without the film makers looking stupid. All I can say is good luck, and in the future try to acquire a screenwriter who knows the story."
402,10,Thought this movie was great!,"One of my favorite Harry Potter films (mainly because I love Snape's character). Although many of the books are depicted quite poorly in several of the films in the series, I still rather enjoyed this movie. Only extreme Potter fans are butthurt over missing plots and ""scenes that should have been included"" but they fail to realize that movies cannot be 6 hours long...."
403,3,Successive Films Cannot Hide Radcliffe or Rowling's Shortcomings,It is a truth universally acknowledged that a writing style consisting of and relying upon verbose regency prose is too unleavened to deal with magic and wonder. 
404,10,SNAPE IS THE GOAT,SCORE: 9.7/10
405,8,"A different Potter, lyrical and introspective","I walked into the theater on opening day expecting a bigger, darker, and equally rushed installment of Harry Potter from David Yates. What I saw couldn't have surprised me more: this newest Potter is unrecognizably different from its predecessors, darker and scarier certainly, but also possessed of a lyricism and artistic expressiveness that had rarely, if ever, graced earlier films in the franchise. Every shot is a work of art; every dialogue carefully calibrated; every moment a visual feast. "
406,3,Now feeling very leery of the next two films...,"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been mentioned about how many important things were left out of this film. My only question is why this film adaptation so horribly represented the story it was supposed to be portraying. I think as the years go by people will look back and realize that David Yates was the worst thing that could have happened to this wonderful and magical epic story. Movies 1-4 were magical, interesting, and although they may not have followed the story-lines exactly, what movie ever has or could? At least they seemed to make every attempt to stay true to the heart of the story. Something that I simply cannot say for this film."
407,1,"Whoever has read the books and still liked the film, must have skimmed the books.","I am still reeling from the triteness and awfulness of this travesty of an adaptation. I noted that someone said that she had just finished reading it then went to see it and thought it was good! Cannot understand why. Perhaps she read it like Yates must have read it, with one eye blind and the other closed. Missing in Action: Head Boy and Girl, all the other memories, Ron's disastrous Quidditch episodes which would have explained why Harry needed to give him lucky potion; regarding potion - Harry did not take all of the potion, he gave it to Ron, Ginny and Hermione, which is why they didn't get killed in the final fight scene - oops, sorry there wasn't this scene in the film, and the stupid fight at the Burrows - not in any of the books that I read, Dumbledore also paralysed Harry at the end, under his cloak - I could go on and on; Ginny and Harry breaking up - what happened to that - not that they got together properly - I am so upset about this film."
408,6,"Came out just as I had Expected... Book readers, ""Avoid at all cost""...",I saw this movie recently and I want to save the other fans of Harry Potter readers from the misery I faced.
409,6,So much potential.,"This is probably one of the most anticipated films of this year aside from Star Trek. After being delayed more than half a year for the sheer purpose of generating more profit (They even had it in theaters earlier in the week than most films so it will get a higher rating on the movie review sites), The Half Blood Prince hit the theaters with high hopes. The midnight showings were packed from what I understand, and the first reviews were very strong. I was stupid enough to keep track of the percentage of positive reviews, even reading the sparse negative reviews to keep myself from getting over-excited. When the time came to see the 6th installment of this movie franchise I was extremely optimistic."
410,2,are you freaking kidding me????,"This is one of the biggest s***iest movies i've seen and one of the worst book adaptations ever...If you are a harry potter fan and have read all the books, then i'll assure you that u'll loathe this film for several reasons of which these are a selected few..."
411,10,amazing,it is a amazing movie there is nothing like this one of a kind movie i hope you enjoy this super movie there is nothing like this it is one of a kind for sure i hope you like this outstanding Harry Potter movie there has never been a movie like this because they never thought of making a movie this good before this is like the best movie ever created well i think so and i hope you think the same way because this is like one of the coolest films ever created this is a must see movie for everyone it is OK for the kids there has never been a movie quite like this before it is one sweet movie that you will enjoy there is nothing made like this it is a movie that you could watch more than once that is how good this movie really is
412,1,I'm disappointed!!!!,"This film is the worst of Harry Potter ever. It has no respect to the book. It looks like somebody put mixed scenes without any order. I'm so disappointed. I'm a big fan of Harry Potter books. This book have so much opportunities and David didn't use it at all. A was a little bit disappointed with the fifth one, but I hoped that the next will be better. But after I saw it i have no wishes to look the last one. I read all books 27 times and have all films at home. The first one movie is the best for me cause it is almost like a book. The second and the third one are very good. Than the forth one started to cut a book and don't follow the theme, but it can be looked. My first disappointment was the fifth one but after I saw Half Blood prince even that one is wonderful. I don't understand why David done that."
413,8,Good but...,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so I was really excited to see the film version of this. There was a lot that I was looking forward to, and I was a little bit disappointed because most of the scenes that I would've liked to see on screen were omitted. That being said, the scenes that were there were fantastic. However, I am still a little confused even years later as to why Death Eaters burned down the Weasleys' home. I thought this films in a really good job with showing the progression of the trio from children to basically soldiers. I think this is one of my favorite of the films simply because it was done so well."
414,9,A different kind of very good,"This is brief, I have lots to do."
415,4,140 minutes of waiting for action,"OK i know that Harry Potter has never been packed full with action and all the other parts before this one had moments i loved watching over and over yet in this one i was completely let down. I counted exactly 5 scenes in the movie where there was some action going on and these make up a maximum of 20 minutes of a 140 minute movie. Since i read the book before i was really excited about the fight at the end and Dumbledores dramatic death. What did i get? No fight and a Dumbledore provoking Draco to kill him in one second and then asking Snape for help in the next with a pathetic ""Sirius. Please."" HELLO?! He was standing next to the death eaters what did he expect him to do?! I was in tears when i read that scene in the book and expected the same in the movie yet i couldn't help laughing at how ridiculous the whole scene was. Not even his dramatic fall could make me feel a tiny bit of sadness. Everything else in the movie was good as always yet as the plot makes up the whole movie i myself can only give 4 out of 10 stars... little hint: i know your not going to be able to resist watching it but i would suggest waiting till its out on DVD its really not worth the money"
416,1,this movie sucked,"I am a pretty big Harry Potter fan and i have for the most part enjoyed the first five movies, but the sixth installment is terrible. I think people who don't read the books and don't look forward to key moments and exciting battles probably enjoy the movie. I on the other hand was ready to get out of the movie theater when it ended it was the worst movie by far! The combination of plot differences between the book and the movie and the drug out romance scenes i was ready to scream. i thought for sure that this movie would be the best one yet due to the exciting story line in the book."
417,2,Was really disappointed,"I was really looking forward to see this movie, even read the book again before hand so I could re call parts. When I went to see the movie I though the general movie on the teenagers was fine but sooooo much was missed!!! It doesn't match the book, there is so much un said/ shown. My husband who came to watch the movie with me has watched the previous movies but had not read the books yet thought the movie was rubbish and so did most the cinema. The extra scene at the Weasleys was rubbish, is was random and showed that the protection that was mean't to be on the house wasn't. The order was hardly in the movie... The Big flight, moaning Murtel etc was not in the movie. They didn't even show them crossing the lake in the cave. The small things and information is what makes the movie. Ron and Hermonie wasn't in the movie as much and were more detached from this all. BTW I love the books.. if you are interested in HP read the books... I just hope the next movie is MUCH better!!"
418,4,Mostly an unexciting summer at the movies!,"This is the very first time I write a comment of a Harry Potter film so I will start saying that of the books I have read just few pages of the first one (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) and of the films well I have seen now after seeing on the big screen yesterday's night this one, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, four and a half of the six. I remember seeing the first one on VHS, the second and third on the big screen and just parts of the fourth one. I'm just not a fan and frankly there's no chance to consider Harry Potter as one of the great movie series. "
419,2,Changed the fundamental elements of the novel,"While the movie was visually stunning, the plot line was awful, in my opinion. For me, the sixth book was about many things, but the dominant storyline was Harry's increasing knowledge about Voldemort (as guided by Dumbledore). His knowledge base grew by frequent meetings with the headmaster and particularly as seen through many memories in the pensieve. The movie only contains two such memories and little else involving this particular quest."
420,6,Decent Harry,"With all of the films you can notice that the acting is improving with the maturity of the characters. You can tell that there is a close bond between the actors of which all pull of their roles well. The directing and visual effects, like all of the films to date does not disappoint. "
421,2,Slow and boring,This is yet another blockbuster of this summer which has no plot and has no convincing actors play.
422,8,Splendid,"8-8-7-8-7-8. That's the track record that the Harry Potter series has racked up to date on my 9-point rating scale. M. Night Shyamalan has been more consistent; he started at 9 and dropped 1 point on each of his next 5 films. Peter Jackson has been more consistently good; I gave all 3 LotR movies a 9. But Harry Potter has maintained its high quality and solid internal consistency under 4 different directors (Chris Columbus, 1–2; Alfonso Cuarón, 3; Mike Newell, 4; and David Yates, 5–6). Credit for that must go, up front, to the source material from author J. K. Rowling. But not enuf attention has been paid to probably the most under- appreciated screenwriter in the biz, Steve Kloves, who authored 1–4 and returns now for 6, after having left Phoenix in the capable hands of Michael Goldenberg. I tend to favor screenplays by a single individual, rather than by committee (which, as we all know, tends to start with a blueprint for a horse and end up with a camel), and Kloves and Goldenberg lend credence to that preference."
423,8,A well-crafted adaptation that will surely displease fan boys,"When I walked into Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I expected a terrible adaptation of quite possibly one of the weaker books in the series. When I walked out of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I was pleasantly surprised with a well-crafted adaptation that bursted with life and vitality, and restored my faith in the Potter franchise. "
424,1,Harry Potter and the half- blood prince,"As Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') dark past."
425,2,God awful,"So bad I'm not sure where to start. I left the theater wondering what the hell I'd just watched and where the hell it'd come from. Case in point the burrow being destroyed was a completely pointless scene that could have been removed so as to make time for actually important things like Dumbledore's ideas as to what the horcruxes could be and even the significance of their existence and the number 7. Voldemort's past is glossed over completely as if they just expect everyone to have read the book before. How Harry and the others will even know what to look for in the next movie I haven't the faintest idea. Much of the movie is centered around the teenage relationships and it just drags the entire movie down with a lot of unneeded fluff. I know that the story's supposed to be about Harry growing up, but there's too much of an imbalance between relationships and the rest of the plot."
426,10,One of the best films ever!,"The newest Harry Potter film, The Half-Blood Prince, has struck magic at the Box-office,with audiences, and with critics. It's also put me under the Harry potter spell. It's the Summer's best film and on my top five ever list. The Harry Potter series has had some great films like The prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire. But The Half-Blood Prince is one that goes deeper into the characters lives. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, who should be in more films )has feelings and things for Ginny Weasly, his best friend's sister. Harry's best friend, besides Ron, Hermione, has feelings for Ron. "
427,10,Best Potter Yet,"If you have not seen the 6th installment of the Harry Potter series of movies, then you need to see it again, again, and again. With the other 5 movies compared, this one outranks them. I have seen all Harry Potter movies on premiere nights and read all 7 books. But nothing compares to the sheer enjoyment of seeing it first-hand. This movie continues the story of the boy who lived and how he has to face to meet the sticky end and destroy one of the powerful darkest wizards of all time. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson give outstanding performances. My congratulations goes to JK Rowling and David Yates, especially to JK, she has poured her heart out over these books and my thoughts and prayers are with her as continues to write and tell her story the best way she could. When this movie comes out on DVD in December I will be getting it to add to my collection. I give this movie a 20 for great special effects and a great storyline."
428,4,Harry Potter 6,Well If liked the 4th movie and can't stand reading this movie is for you however if you liked the book and thought that the 5th movie was a great Summary and was a improvement over the fourth YOU WILL BE DISSAPIONTED!! This Movie To me was Hollywood turning not so Interesting book in their perspective into one there is more romance in the movie than the book. and the way he did the romance was made everything funny. That and the first Scene in the movie Was not in the book at all. Once a again David Yates has Let Down Fans Of The Book Series By Cutting out a scene cause he didn't know how to do it so he made some quick way by doing adding something funny and making himself look bad in front of a world harry potter book audience . The First scene could have been quick Harry could have had his face on the glass with and a note From Dumbledore saying he would pick him up Friday at 11pm and the lights go out out side and and harry awakes and starts to throw stuff in his trunk and heads down stairs to find Dumbledore greeted by Uncle Vernon Did harry tell that i was coming and then a angry and shocked look on the uncle's face and Dumbledore explains why he's there and him and harry take off into the night. If done right it could have been done in the same amount of time as the Fake not needed scene in the first five minutes The Ending where Dumbledore dies should not of change and Did David Yates Not Read The Story Nevile Longbottom is not even in the movie he has one line He Is A important Character in the book and has to kill Voldemort in the seventh book I know i'll be waiting for the first part of the seventh movie to be released for i will not be going opening night i will wait for one of the fans of the book to write how the first part is. This movie was better than 4 in the long run but to me only by a notch so i gave it a rating above what i would rate it If Hollywood or David Yates Reads This Summaries Work great For movie i was pleased with what u did with the fifth book and how you summarized it in the film this is what you should have done with the sixth film not gone back to your ways of the fourth
429,5,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, seen all movies and read all the books. I showed up 3 hours early to make sure I got a good seat for this very anticipated movie. I'm very disappointed in the movie. I liked the special effects and they were a couple of things added that I thought were pretty good. But you can't rewrite the book so that it will fit into a 2 1/2 hour movie and be good for all of the little kids. The 6th book was supposed to be dark and I'm a little worried that they will forget this in the Book 7 movies as well. The fan base for Harry Potter has grown up with the movies, they aren't all still 10 years old. The kids who watched the first movie are now teenagers. In order to keep the movie PG and appropriate for small children they changed to many things and left out more than I can comprehend. "
430,1,Harry Potter?,"Lets just start off with if you had the choice of sitting in a electric chair or watching harry potter chose the electric chair, its less painful. The movie was slow and boring and lacked any entertainment once so ever. At times when the movie was trying to be funny it was just an awkward silence and let me just say this was only 10 minutes into the movie and i was already board out of my mind. The movie seemed to be low key and had no action through out the film. If you are thinking about seeing this movie, don't, its horrible in every shape way or form. So i give it one star because this website dose not allow me to give a worse rating. -Vinny Pizzi"
431,4,Where is the magic?,"When memory of the book evades you, you read it again if you have the patience or if it's so popular that it's been adapted for screen you best head to the theatre to rekindle the fervor, the anxiety and the nail biting experienced while turning the pages. Harry Potter and the half blood prince, while attempting to live up to the hype sorely misses the action, adventure and magic that are necessary to pace a fantasy movie. "
432,5,This is boring and bad!!!,"Come on, are you serious? I saw this last night and actually fell asleep! I can't remember the last time that this happened in a cinema as I'm a avid movie lover...This was the more boring 2.5 hrs I've sat through in a long time!!! Harry Potter is supposed to be a magician but we never saw any of his supposed potential!!! In fact he waved his wand a few times and barely conjured up any magic at all... No action, just long drawn scenes that went nowhere...together with no plot cohesion...bad boring movie that only wins with people because the novels are extremely popular!!! I suggest that everyone waits for the DVD release!"
433,10,Loads better than the first 5 put together,"I just watched the movie again for the second time. I have to say, this movie is by far the best of the series so far. I agree that it does not follow the book 100%, but things are left out in all the movies, and this one was 2 1/2 hours long even! Besides the ending battle being out, the burrow burning, and all the quirky scenes between harry and Ginny (I love the pairing but I don't think Bonnie whats-her-face has enough personality for Ginny's character) I thought they did an excellent job with the details from the book. This movie was how they should have made the other 5 movies; The acting was very much improved on everyone's part, the smaller scenes practically matched the book word-for-word, and the visual effects were absolutely stunning (dumbledores ring of fire, anyone?) All in all, my disappointment by the lack of some details was completely overshadowed by everything else in this movie. If the next 2 movies are anything like this one was, Harry Potter will have a tremendous ending."
434,3,writer/director did not understand the story,"Like a couple of the previous movies, this was adapted by someone who either didn't get the big picture of HP or just didn't care. They flex their CG muscles in ways that add nothing to the story and take time away from important story points. I understand that a movie is different than the book it is based on, there's no way around that. But this movie missed the mark on several MAJOR MAJOR points that are necessary to the story moving forward."
435,5,Read the book,"First of all, let me tell you that this is the worst harry potter movie ever made... and this is ridiculous because the book, harry potter and half blood prince is the best Harry potter book of the series. When I saw the order of Phoenix movie, I realized that I couldn't wait 4 years to know how the saga was going to end... I don't like reading books but I made an exception... and thank god that I read the book because the movie is so fast, so unclear and so dark that people that has not read the book, will understand nothing... In the book, the young live of Tom Riddle is exhaustively explained... and in the movie? In the movie only the visit to the orphanage! Really sick. More things... the final scene... what a XXXX! In the book the ambient is outstanding... but in the movie.... what a bad final scene. And for people who don't know.... this movie was scheduled for November 2008... but in October 2008 they decided that for economical purposes they will not release the movie 'til July 2009 even though the movie was already finished and packaged... Want an advice from a person that hate reading books? Read the book instead of viewing this awful movie."
436,10,Phenomenal Film!!,"Absolutely phenomenal film with great philosophical messages, acting, producing, directing, etc. It is a renowned and fantastic film! I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
437,3,Harry Potter and the Almost Absent Main Plot,"If you are a big fan of the books, like me, you will probably watch this movie no matter what, as I have done. I'm sorry to say though that the biggest spoiler is doing just that. Lets take a look: "
438,10,Funniest Harry Potter movie,"I loved how funny this movie was, and in that regard it was an improvement over all the other HP movies. It was the funniest HP movie, but most importantly it didn't have too much humour either, so it was able to retain the dark and hopeless theme whilst also being funny in parts."
439,4,Never read the book? Go see it. You have? Don't expect much,"I never read the book or the series for that matter so I guess my opinion doesn't matter but I'm on a mission to review every movie I saw in 2009 so here it goes. I thought the movie was funnier and more mature than the other Potter films but of course every negative comment i see here is about taking out scenes like the epic battle at the end, the character of Bill and many and I mean MANY scenes. I read somewhere that they took out many of these scenes because they are building up everything to be amazing for the last book. Well lets hope so because this movie was as disappointing as the second Transformers movie. Stick to the book director and please the fans. Expect a huge disappointment from this movie if you are a die hard fan."
440,9,An Imperfect Adaptation but Still a Good Film,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rating: B 
441,4,"bored, bored, bored","I've been reading that if you're a fan of the books, you'll hate the movie and likewise, if you haven't read the books, you'll like the film."
442,6,It was OK,I am not a reader of the books. Might read them after the movies are through. Seems like the books just ruin all the movies.
443,4,"Plodding, illogical, overlong","I've never read any of the Potter books, so I watched HP & the HBP as a movie plain and simple, and found myself bored to tears. Of course the art direction and design are again spectacular, but the story is a loose patchwork of disparate elements that is far from compelling and often seems unacceptably random. Why, for instance, does Dumbledore need to drink the fluid that contains the horcrux? It is also quite galling that characters who possess impressive powers of magic never use them at obvious times. Dumbledore is able to magically transport himself and Potter to a desolate rock in the sea (though it's unclear why they would stop there except for creating a nice shot), but then when he has to cross the lake in the cave, he has to conjure up a boat? Logic is nowhere to be found; the Hogwarts management must be senile to keep allowing the obviously evil Malfoy in, and blind not to suspect Snape. And while Voldemort's cronies have ample opportunity to kill Potter, they refrain from doing so because Voldemort has to do it himself. Why are villains always so unpragmatic? Of course a movie about magic requires suspension of disbelief. But that doesn't mean the makers can get away with anything. And while there is much talk of the more serious, 'psychological' nature of this installment, it all struck me as pretty obvious and very superficial. It's all very well to turn Malfoy into a doubting, troubled youngster all of a sudden, but how did that come about? Nobody cares to explain that to the viewer. In all, this is an overlong, self-important offering that ploddingly drags along to an unsatisfying end. The Prisoner of Azkaban remains, by a wide margin, the best of the Potter films."
444,7,Puppy Love hurts... More than a vicious attack by Lord Voldemort,"Based on my previous comments on films in the Harry Potter series, I received the feedback/criticism of people that I'm putting the emphasis too much on the ""coming of age"" aspect. It's certainly part of J. K. Rowling's franchise, but apparently not the essence. Fair enough, I was willing to keep this in mind for my next viewing, and that would be ""The Half-Blood Prince"". Well, I'm sorry, but after this film I'm even more convinced the true essence of the series is about growing up and the establishing of one's personality during the teenage years."
445,1,A Disgrace for all readers.. a comedy for movie watchers,"Being a reader and viewer of all the books and movies I have to say by far this is the worst movie. For one the movie did not show any important detail that viewers need to know for the final two movies. The important Tom Riddle memories weren't shown. No Funeral? No Big fight at the end? No werewolf attack? I can go on and on. It seemed they cut out all of the action and dark parts and put in comedy and romance. Although romance is an important part of this book, the scenes had to be the cheesiest and was completely over the top."
446,4,The screen Writer should be shot,"Who's bright Idea was it to make Harry Potter 6 as awful as what I just saw in the movie theater? They basically turned a great book into a PG rated Nightmare. I understand they want to make money but after watching this movie I want 2 things back. The $10 I spent on the ticket and the 2 and a half hours I had to spend in that theater. I understand about time and not trying to make another titanic length movie, but adding stuff that has not meaning for the 6th's book, Taking out a key point: the battle at the end, that what give this movie their WTF moments. I mean who goes to a school and just blows up the hall, please! I also don't remember Hargats house being set a flame. This movie was a study in what not to do as a script writer. I mean was I the only one that wondered who the heck was the big guy that they featured when looking at the death eater yet never told you what he's purpose was. I think the script writes should get on their knees and apologies to us all for this trash. This makes me fearful of what they plan for book 7, which they are cutting into 2 movies. If either one of them is PG I'm skipping them. over 20 people died in book 7 to make it PG would mean that all the fights and all the key points in the movies would be excluded. I can tell you as a fan giving it a 4 was being nice it doesn't rate that high"
447,10,worth to watch...unless compared with book,just saw the movie.well it was not really up to exceptions but what can u except ?? its 800 page long book.and it is not possible to take everything in 2:30 hrs time.
448,6,Do not understand why Yates felt the need to rewrite the story,"This movie was a serious disappointment to me, and it makes me worry that with the last two movies in the same director's hands that we are losing our beloved series to capricious and seemingly random rewriting. Did JK Rowling have any input into this one? Will she return to the set to try to recover control in the final segments of the story? I sure hope so."
449,8,Magnificent entertainment delivers one of the best of the series,"It is somewhat amazing to think that this series is coming to an end. When it first started, eight years ago, it seemed to be a very dull transfer to screen but, under the guidance of some fine directors, the films have become highlights of a year's releases. With ""Half-Blood Prince"" we have the best of the films since Alfonso Cuaron's ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". Though some problems remain, this is a thoroughly entertaining, highly effective, visually arresting piece of work which can be enjoyed by young and old alike."
450,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: full blooded funmaking fills my veins,Finally!! A Harry Potter movie that I really liked.
451,1,This story was destroyed,Dear Folks:
452,6,Ehh.. Nothing Special,"As with every movie that I've seen this summer, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince was hit and miss. Though I believe that it is the first one that had more hits than misses."
453,5,"Teen love, thin plot","Now far removed from the innocence of Chris Columbus' literally faithful yet cinematically unsatisfying Hogwarts appertif ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" at the onset plunges to its increasingly horrifying world with little regard to establishing its characters or the story for the sake of those uninitiated, which is not to say it's a bad thing, since it's unlikely one would only start this deep into the series. Yet it's this same urgency that typifies this installment's character as less a product in itself than an obligatory assemblage of a gorgeous production design and a handsome cinematography designed for the series' inevitable denouement. Set to conclude with the seventh book split into two parts, there are no more surprises, only mandatory buildup."
454,9,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" Brings the Magic Back!","""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the sixth movie in the Harry Potter franchise and continues the story of the young wizard as he faces his greatest challenges yet. The film explores the relationship between Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (played by Michael Gambon) as they try to uncover the truth about Voldemort's past and prepare for the final battle."
455,8,Half blood prince was OK... but it's not gonna be in my favourite movie list.^^,Well for me ... I thought the movie was OK having read the books at least 3 times each. The 6th movie of the Harry Potter series focused more on the emotion part. The emotions were very apparent in the film which blended well with the cinematography and the music. I appreciate the fact that they developed the Harry/Ginny relationship in the film since it was a shocker for some of the readers to see this couple happening. Considering that Harry Potter and the Half blood prince is a pretty long book. I thought the film version was pretty well done. Although I would have been thrilled if they included Voldemort's very dark past(killing his own family for one) and also the battle at Hogwarts and Dumbledore's funeral. 
456,6,"Good Romantic Comedy, although the book was more of a thriller","Stripped of all context and pretension, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, is a nice romantic comedy. If you are looking for a teenage romance and some innocent laughs, look no further. You will like this movie, and I don't resent you for it. That being said, I do not believe that the people making HBP understood the roll that the source material plays in the Harry Potter saga. In the book, Harry is faced with the reality that there is no one to protect him from the vengeance of Lord Voldemort, and that he himself cannot protect those he loves. It is the beginning of the end, as the inevitability of his confrontation with his arch-nemesis is driven home by the murder of his mentor. It is a thriller. The fact that the movie focuses instead on Harry's budding love life is difficult to swallow for a fan of the book. This sixth installment is also the book in which professor Snape's loyalty as a double agent is suspect. In the book, Snape's ability to conceal his true emotions and thoughts is second to none, whereas Alan Rickman portrays him as transparently hesitant. This ruins the ""surprise"" (or at least the catharsis) of his eventual redemption in the final installment. The suspense of the source material, the darkness that the death of Dumbledore deserves, the doubt and fear that Harry should feel at the end, as he sets off alone to find the hidden pieces of Voldemort's soul, is not adequately conveyed. There is no Battle of the Astronomy Tower or Funeral for Dumbledore (two of the most iconic scenes in the book). The film instead concentrates on comic relief and high school romance in a way that draws the attention away from the main plot line of murder and betrayal. And not in a good way. As a result, HBP does not serve the same purpose as its source material. That being said, the film is generally well designed, shot and acted. Many of the child actors have come into their own and the special effects are top notch. It is funny and usually touching at the appropriate times. Even the darker scenes are executed with the intended effect. This does not make it a dark movie, though. It is not a bad movie in and of itself, but it does fail to focus on what seems to be the main plot line of the book. The book is a great thriller, whereas the movie is just a decent romantic comedy. The 6 out of 10 -I confess- is more a result of my purism and disappointment than the quality of the movie."
457,8,This had an Empire Strikes Back feel to it,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) is a movie my daughter and I watched on HBOMAX together recently. The storyline depicts the continued rise of Lord Voldemort's army. As he builds his forces Harry digs into his past looking for clues to hopefully help him find a weakness that can be used against him.
458,4,Where is this movie's Horcrux????,"Dude, ""Where is the Horcrux of this film??"" The film is soul-less. Warner Bros has successfully torn the story's soul apart and have hidden it: my guess as to where the pieces are?? How about in each of the $200 plus million bucks this movie is going to easily earn. That is the tragedy. The movie is an empty shell robbed of the richness of the original story and the characters. Make no mistake...the production is stupendous, special effects are a marvel, the music is suitably brooding and Gothic, and the actors shuffle about mouthing dialogue and play their parts. The suspense element, what little of it is on screen is also terrific. There simply isn't enough of the good stuff. By cutting out a significant chunk of the bad guy's back story and various elements charting the growing emotional and romantic relationships among the leads especially Ginny/Harry and perhaps reserving an important concluding sequence from the book for the next film installment, what had all the elements for a great movie is now simply a just another summer movie. Conclusion: a well made empty film that is going to earn a zillion bucks."
459,1,only if i could give this 0/10,"i don't know what to comment about,there's nothing in the movie to comment about the first half was a teen-movie the second half was worse(the cave scene was okay) burrow scene was pointless(actually i found the entire movie pointless) there was no emotion in the end scene and the dumbledore's death scene(i was happy dumbledore was dead and the torcher movie was over) ginny weasley is given way too much importance(she hides the HBP's book and not harry) and i cannot imagine lavender blabbering about ron in front of the teachers let alone the headmaster dumbledore asks harry about his feelings for hermione there is plenty of these idiotic scenes,i don't understand how so many gave it 10/10 this might be the worst movie i have ever seen,shame IMDb doesn't have a 0/10 rating"
460,10,So Freaking Fantastic!,"Well...I saw the film today, and was not only impressed, but totally blown away. I thought the other films blew me away when I saw them (except OOTP), but this is the first movie in the series that I consider, seriously, a possible Oscar contender. The acting, music, cinematography, script, directing are all excellent."
461,9,What a nice warm movie.,"It's like a cuddly toy this film. If you watch all the harry potter films, this one is like the comforting mug of hot chocolate before the storm. It's funny, romantic, magical and most importantly, very beautiful to just look at. The performances have come a lot further. Emma Watson is less dramatic, Daniel Radcliffe takes a surprising and quite frankly hilarious turn in Harry's character at one certain point in the film!"
462,9,Don't Forget This:,"It has occurred to me that many of you commentors have forgotten that Rowling agreed to every change made to her own work for the movie. If you trust in her ability as an artist, as you who write things like ""I am an avid fan"" and ""I love the Harry Potter series"" do, you then must trust those in whom she has confidence! Like many of you have said, they cannot possibly involve every ounce of flavor from the books into the movie, and therefore they must set up the final two films."
463,8,Enjoyable entry to the franchise,Malfoy in entrusted with a responsibility as the threat of Voldemort looms over Hogwartz.
464,1,Don't waste the money to see it.,This is a seriously sad adaptation of a beloved story. AWFUL.
465,7,"Potter Movie comes of age.. the best of the series, till now","The previous installments of Harry Potter have all been thorough disappointments of what the books represented, and me, being an avid HP fan found them quite hard to digest. "
466,6,"Good movie, but lacklustre in comparison to the book","The Half-Blood Prince was one of the best books out of the entire series for me, but the movie fails to live up to the book and is easily the weakest of the films. It could have been one of the best, but ended up being the worst. "
467,10,"Not bad, a bit dark",This one was interesting I mainly like this one because of Jenny
468,7,Very good and darker,Harry potter and the half blooded prince is the sixth installment of the Harry Potter franchise. Harry is still dealing with Sirius Black's death and Voldermort is still lurking in the mist. Meanwhile Harry and the gang have to figure out who the half blooded prince is and is Albus Dumbledore in grave danger.
469,3,Not better then the last one,"This movie is weak. I heard rumors that it is great, but I was disappointed when I saw it. Again, much of the story has been cut off, like some parts vitally important for the sequel. Voldemort's flashbacks which are the most interesting thing in the book has been seriously reduced. We didn't find out nothing about Voldemort's family and very little about his personality. Snape, who is very important character in this sequel was to little used and some of them like Moody and Scrimgeour were not used at all. Action scene at the end has been cut off and Dumbledore's end badly changed. Harry's relationship with Ginny is not long enough developed and badly presented. Young Riddle is acted badly, Alan Rickman casting Snape is to old, Ginny is not pretty at all ,as well as Lawender Brown. I don't know why Harry Potter movies can't be longer, at least 3 hours long, most of people wouldn't have problem with that. At least they should put extra part on DVD."
470,6,Will it pay a price for altering and cutting the original story-line?,"I was very excited to watch this movie mainly because of two reasons, 1. It is a harry potter movie and 2. The story takes a decisive turn in finding weapons that will lead to the final goal of throwing out the dark lord. However, I was disappointed after watching this movie as the movie is completely out of line from the original book. We all understand that the entire book can not be covered in a movie that is about 2 hrs long but this one misses too many important events that any harry potter book reader will not be able to digest. The cinematography , sound and special effects are all great in this movie but just the constant reminder of many scenes that any harry potter book lover will miss in this movie is a killer for me. If you have not read Harry Potter books than probably you want find any difference and will actually like this movie but for someone like me who loves Harry Potter books will definitely be disappointed. And all around the world this series of movies have become very popular just because most of them have read harry potter books. The director has disappointed all the harry potter book lovers in this movie and it will be very interesting to see whether it will also affect the gross turn-out and ultimately the profit. I am now looking forward for the Blu Ray release of this movie especially the 'extended version' if they have any plans for the extended version of this movie. For me that might make sense."
471,8,R.I.P The angel,"Harry have since the last movie some connections with Voldemort and we know a lot more in this episode. Malefoy is becoming more and more seen as a treat in this one since the beginning of the movie. Still have some new interesting characters, some great revelations(about the half-blood prince). And the end a tragic event will change harry's life for ever. A nice movie who we can see also some love between the students and its prety representative of real life. I enjoyed it very much."
472,7,The most highly anticipated movie of the summer is worth the hype!,"The eagerly anticipated sixth installment of the Harry Potter franchise has arrived! Fortunately, the waits and delays were worth it. Although none of the Harry Potter movies have come close to the brilliance of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is probably the first film that actually surpassed the book in quality. Though it helped that I found the sixth book to be the weakest in the entire series, it is also a compliment to the film-makers, in particular the director, David Yates, and its stars, with special mention to the three main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson."
473,6,Worst One Yet,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review: Or Harry Potter and The Really Long film where very little happens that's right after 2 and a half hours of loved up teenagers 'snogging' (to use their words) what we get is less Harry Potter more Angus, Thongs and Perfect Wizards. Like all Potters the film has it's moments but this is by far the weakest one yet "
474,8,Beautiful,"Beautiful and explanatory film of the wizard saga. The film feels very much like a film of passage necessary for the plot but without a great soul which, however, makes it very well for what it has to do."
475,1,Worst HP Movie ever,"Only ~20% of movie contains main story. About 80% is high-school children loves. Lover fights, feelings... Young actors & actress acts are very awful."
476,10,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,10/10 - yet another delightful year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
477,8,Surprising,"After the poor adaptation of ""The Order of Phoenix"", I thought I would have seen again a disastrous Harry Potter movie, and I especially blamed the director and the main actor for this. Knowing that this installment had disappointed some fans really didn't help me to have positive expectations on ""The Half-Blood Prince"". But what I saw at the cinema was truly different from my low hopes. Director David Yates has improved, but not so much; Daniel Radcliffe persists in being a poor actor, but a whole team of non-supporting wonderful actors protects him - Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange make such a good job in their roles. The real magic here, that makes the movie better, is the screenplay and the special effects. The story flows smoothly and can be understood even by the audience who didn't read the novel, because this time there are no many complicated mysteries, supernatural creatures and a lot of useless subplots. "
478,9,Best One Yet!,"This movie was amazing. Even with the changes that some people believe were way too drastic the movie remained true to the book without that rushed feeling that Order of the Phoenix had. I know some people think ""oh everybody likes the next one the best just because it's the next one"" but this was just really well done."
479,5,This installment of the Harry Potter film series was phoned in.,"Of all the HP films – most of which were on the money and the Prisoner of Azkaban a brilliant offering that could stand on its own (except for the disappointing omission of Snape's fabulous tantrum when he discovers that Black has escaped from Hogwart's dungeon) – ""Prince"" is the one that has been messed up beyond the pale. Certainly it is a challenge to depict a book in movie form, but a skilled writer-director team could capture all the salient details and charming nuances if they so desired. This hodge-podge makes me believe that this installment was merely a throw-away from the producer's, director's and writer's viewpoint. What a shame and a waste. Makes me wonder what they are going to do to Ms. Rowling's final masterpiece, which is coming out in two parts. My confidence has been shaken. Messrs. Heyman, Yates and Kloves owe Ms. Rowling and the fans of her Harry Potter books a huge apology for phoning this one in.Summary:"
480,8,Review for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"This is my second time watching this movie. I let Jaime picked something that she was more familiar with after our daughter came home from the hospital. For me, I'm a bigger fan of the latter movies in the Harry Potter series since they are the most adult with the darkest themes. It has been sometime since my first viewing and having read the books so it was nice to watch this with my wife since she just re-read them."
481,10,"Beautiful, Funny, Dramatic and Dark... a complete film","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the sixth film in the Harry Potter series. It was delayed for almost eight months, and finally it is out."
482,7,Can Hardly imagine whether Muggles cud follow the movie...!,"The Movie i would say was relatively a bit disappointing to the previous one,period.The primary reason being,the movie has scenes woven in such a manner that u really gotta have read the book or at least read the movie's plot in the internet to follow.I felt way too bad for my friends who were followers of the movie but not the book,blinking at the turn of events for good amount,parts of the movie. The next disappointment was it had very few magical delights,people hardly cast magic or fight in the movie,its all brought down to conversations,Damn!Whatever u see in the trailer is all the candy in the movie. But it ain't justice to just complain about this movie,cause it has its own light hearted moments,Hermione n Ron,Harry n Slughorn,Harry n Lovegood,Ron's Quidditch moments and his first love were all nice to watch. The movie is set during difficult times,but it doesn mean every scene has to be dark toned,where is the gorgeous meadows,the distant shots of hogwarts,these are somethings which were missing starting from the HP5 itself. The other students of hogwarts Neville Longbottom,the patel sisters,Crabbe and Goyle,and many more,even though who don't have any serious role in the story could have had actually a few parts to be played in the movie,it made my ""Movie Friends"" wonder,'did they have a quarrel or something?'! The credits music ""the Weasley Stomp"" was very good,but what the heck...it followed an awkward final minutes in any HP movie,why was that Sooooo lame,David Yates?! OK guys,if u r acquainted with Harry potter,u r cursed to watch it whatever it is,but u fall under the regular Movie goer category,think twice,hope it doesn do a sectumsempra on u!"
483,7,"Life Keeps Getting Darker, and Tougher, as Harry and Friends Enter Adolescence","The maturation of the Harry Potter franchise is finally complete in this, the sixth go-round for Harry, Ron, Hermione and friends. Gone (or greatly reduced) are the Hogwarts Academy's whimsical little accents - jovial ghosts, talking paintings, animated plants, hidden chambers - replaced by a quivering mass of moody sentiment, rampaging emotions and stormy romances. It's sensible. The colorful decor we see in kindergarten doesn't usually match what's on the walls in high school."
484,8,Makes a magnificent novel look bad... more than disappointing,"I have been reading many user's comments and I agree with most of them: the movie is a horrible Harry Potter story wannabe. Among the things that disappointed me are the terrible omissions to key parts of the plot, not only for this novel but for the development of the next installment's plot; turning a dark drama into a stained comedy, focusing in the wrong things; and other already mentioned fails from the overall story. As for the filming, David Yates should leave!! As a Harry Potter fan, watching the 5th film after reading the 5th novel was heart-sinking. It was awful. I thus had mild expectations from this film, hoping of course it would improve; but it just disappointed me again (although it was a little better than the last). I thought the editing was really bad (not much could be done since must of the story was chopped off), and the soundtrack was, again, terrible. Nicholas Hooper has no imagination whatsoever, reusing tracks such as ""Fireworks"" from his score of the previous film and even altering a magnificent work of art from John William's third score for the Quidditch match. No doubt, fans should unite and scream to JKR that these men stop butchering her babies. David Yates should be gone, ALFONSO CUARÓN should come back, work with Steven Kloves and the composer should be the epic JOHN WILLIAMS!!"
485,5,HP6,"Half-Blood isn't bad so much as it is out of place. We're ramping up to the finale here, things are getting serious and some pretty heavy stuff happens here but there's also way way way too much teen drama here. So much of this is focused on the dating life of our intrepid trio. Again, I don't think that's bad, I just don't think it belongs at this stage in the series. Lord V is out there doing stuff, people are dying, war is coming and I frankly could not care any less about Ron thinking it's weird that Harry is dating his sister. Again though, if you're at movie 6 the reviews don't mean a whole lot unless these things suddenly turned just awful. You're invested at this point and it will get better..."
486,1,By far the weakest in the series and a very weak movie to boot,"This was by far the weakest movie in the series. I brought a person to the movie with me that has never read a HP book, nor has she seen a HP movie. I though the movie was weak compared to the book which was full of lush details and motivations entirely lacking in the movie. Then I looked at her face and knew she was thinking ""say what?"""
487,,"confusing, but fun","I haven't read the books. I haven't even watched all the movies. I didn't think I would like Half Blood Prince because I assumed that the series was too dark and grown up, and that all the fun and adventure from the early chapters was gone. But this movie left me wanting more."
488,3,"Disappointing, the worst Harry Potter I have seen","OK, the from the first to the fourth movie of the Harry Potter films, things were looking good and better, ""Order of the phoenix"" was good but not as good as ""Goblet of fire"", I thought this one would be a little better, but the trailer was very deceiving."
489,4,A far cry from the novel,"From the opening of the film, it's obvious that this is no longer Rowling's story. There's a spectacular effect of the Millennium Bridge being destroyed. Then we find Harry for some reason in a subway diner reading the Daily Prophet. (Wouldn't he be more cautious in the Muggle world?) He then begins flirting with a waitress when Dumbledore appears across the tracks, stone still like a statue."
490,6,Letdown by the Disappointing 3D IMaxVersion,"Truth to tell, I had very high expectations of this film because of the sheer awesomeness of the last Harry Potter movie (HP and the Order of the Phoenix), particularly the 3D I-Max version. However, this installment is just alright with me. I think my very high expectations got the better of me, and that affected my overall appreciation of the movie."
491,8,Are they people out there that haven't seen Harry Potter???,Snape finally got his job as defense of dark arts teacher. Another great adventure and very dark Harry Potter film. The end of an era.
492,8,"Half-Blood Prince reaches its peak in technical and character development, improving all aspects of the previous film and proves that the adjustments were not made by chance","Steve Kloves changed important parts of the narrative J. K. Rowling, removed details of certain sequences to make them more dynamic, accelerated in certain passages and contained in others. Action scenes left and teenage romances appear. He joins all subplots with cohesion and makes the powerful climax, not so much in action, certainly in the category emotion (especially for those who had not read the earlier books). In adapting not see some important events: Some characters were cut."
493,6,3 out 4 themes sacrificed for emphasis of 4th (teen romance/comedy),"I enjoy the HP books immensely, but attempt to approach the movies from the understanding that they cannot be literal representations of the books. What should be included versus what should not boils down to whether it is important to: The main themes of the book and/or The mythology of the series as a whole. These things, in their order of importance, are:"
494,7,Half-baked Prince may have been a better sub-title,"Apparently for some unknown reason, Steve Kloves screenplay & David Yates direction is not the same as the book that J.K. Rowling wrote."
495,9,Is half-blood prince the worst movie?,"Half-blood prince used to be my favorite Harry Potter movie, but then I read the books. I was so disappointed from the way this movie was filmed. The best parts of the books are not included in the movies and a lot of things are not explained. If the director had done the film similar with book, this movie would have been a masterpiece. However, I still love this movie."
496,,Harry Potter and the soul sucking film.,Sorry. That's the best title I can come up with right now. Maybe I'll edit it later.
497,1,Plain Awful,"OMG, what an awful movie. I don't even know that a movie can be so bad. I went to saw it because that I saw every previous ones and it have a good grade in IMDb, but it was sooooo bad, that I even can't believe it yet."
498,5,Not very good,"This movie is mostly nonsense. If you are a fan of barely explained plot devices, bad acting, slowly deteriorating effects, new magical items that will exist in one movie alone, and a convoluted story, then congratulations - you've made it this far. This movie is basically just fan service for the Harry Potter book fans (all the movies are fan service for the book fans). I would not recommend this movie."
499,5,"Cringe overload, worst of the series","The acting by Radcliffe and various others in this is like watching paint dry, it's so very dead and empty."
500,7,Half-blood,"I liked this one because of how dark it is, and the character building leading to the final two parts of deathly hallows."
501,10,a harry potter movie with the light moments,I just watched this movie in theatres last night and I have to say it is filled more with comedy and light moments than any Harry potter movie but that's only because this is meant to be a lightly entertaining movie the acting was very good by most Tom Felton's role without a doubt had to capture your interest as you watch the movie this movie skips a lot that happens in the book but it makes you laugh as well the scene in the climax is most dramatic in the movie I kind of wish that they would be honest to the books seeing as how the 4th and 5th movies were very rushed the film also has a lt of wity dialogues that made the audience and my self laugh out loud when I walked out of the theater I kind of wished that Harry Potter wpuld never be over but all things come to an end and eventually will the Harry Potter series but definitely go watch this movie it is definitely worth it.
502,8,"Good and Entertaining, not amazing.","To start off, I will address the common complaint that people are having with the film. They are saying that it's doesn't stay faithful to the book. I have something to say to the fans. As you may know, this is the first movie to be released since the series has been completed. With all the other movies they had tried to cram in as much information as possible because they never knew what would become important later. Now that they know, they're only going to keep in what's important and be a more entertaining movie. Once you're aware that not all story lines will be in this film you will have a good time."
503,8,Finally,Ugh finally someone died who is actually important to the story
504,9,Bloody awesome,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is such a step up from it's 2 predecessors and the best Harry Potter movie we've had since Prisoner of Azkaban, it manages to get so much done in it's very long runtime and also perfectly paved the way for the conclusion to the universe, it's a dark and brooding film with a compelling mystery and a phenomenal use of backstory for our main villain."
505,5,Truly bad,"I must say I really didn't like the film, it glosses over too much, it is visually stunning and some of the cinematography is beautiful but the story just isn't there, I have read half-blood prince twice and loved it and was really looking forward to the film but I must say it was a let down and a very anti climactic end."
506,9,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the best movie in all saga,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the best movie in all saga. It is the gloomy and perfectly directed movie. The last 2 movies are executed at this level too, but they lose in dynamics as are divided into 2 parts. In Half-Blood Prince important subject events open. And Albus Dumbledore death - top of development of the saga about Harry Potter."
507,6,"Incoherent and misguided, a severe straying from the franchise's quality","With any literary adaptation there lies a precarious balance between adhering faithfully to the text and re-shaping the content for a suitably cinematic watch, and never has this been more true than with the Harry Potter franchise. Forced to appease a massive fan base, most of the early films favour a talky, slightly clunky style, as if afraid to take chances cinematically at the expense of precious content. As such, it is both a blessing and a curse that with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, returning director David Yates appears finally confident of just about every potential viewer on the planet being abundantly familiar with Potter lore enough to finally branch out from the irritatingly excessive exposition of the earlier films. The problem being, Yates' chosen approach backfires spectacularly, managing to mostly squander one of the most intriguing narratives in the Potter series in an inane, incoherent mess. "
508,8,I'll give it a B+,I thought this harry potter movie was really good. But i thought the ending was pretty bad because they didn't do the battle that was in the end of the book.
509,2,Adding fluff removing essentials,"I'm a huge Harry Potter geek and have read all the books several times. I got to say that this movie was the biggest let down so far from the franchise, and was the reason that made me wait 5 years to watch the next one after its release.<br /><br />From PoA to OOTP it felt like they cut out nonessential moments but in general kept the things that made Harry Potter what it is. Magic, friendship, wonder, family, with dark overtones but still with light, happy and silly moments. Ofc you could always wish for more in all the movies (Dumbledores explaination of the prophecy in the end of OOTP which is my favorite) but hey, it's a long book put into 2 hours of screen time, something's will go out. But not in HBP.<br /><br />Here they instead added things that wasn't in the book and made the people who only looked at the movies miss out on huge impactful moments. And not only that, it completely F'd up a lot of the rules and boundaries which is a corner stones for every fantasy world.<br /><br />As a reader, you know that in DH how shocked they all were at Voldemort being able to fly like a ghost when they chased the 7 Potters. Here in the start, all death eaters can fly like black vapor through the sky and no one thinks it's a big deal. Dumbledore can apparate inside Hogwarts grounds. Firstly, one question that has been through the whole story so far has been, who is the strongest when it comes to just pure use of magic, is it Dumbledore or Voldemort? Everyone on the good side says Dumbledore, but I feel like Voldemort is probably a stronger magical user he has tapped into dark magic that Dumbledore never would dream of doing. But Dumbledore like Harry, has the ability to love, which is the strongest form of magic. They have only once come face to face with each other so far we know, and that is in OOTP and there they are equals. This is key factor to why they are safer at Hogwarts than anywhere else, cause Dumbie is there and ... YOU CAN'T APPARATE INSIDE HOGWARTS GROUNDS. This create big plot holes. Why couldn't Voldemort just apparate inside Hogwarts with his army and kill them all? Cause for all we know they are equals in magical use, so if Dumbie can, why can't Voldie? Love has nothing to do with apparition. The reason why Draco spent the whole frigging book slaving away repairing the cabinet is because of this reason."
510,8,David Yates does a better job in this film.,"After only a median direction of David Yates in the fifth movie , he can redeem himself in this film , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , the more the film still has many problems, as the novel dull Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown , that does not work , the more I believe that this is intentional , and sudden passion of Harry Potter by Ginny Weasley , the cast is fine , I liked the scenes with Jim Broadbent , this very well in the film , the soundtrack is still great, special effects are great , the script is a bit problematic , and I do not like the Draco Malfoy in this film , the more the film has a very sad ending , the last 40-30 minutes is very good. Note 8.4"
511,8,Story was not as intriguing as it could,"Sectumsempra, aka non-lethal Avada Kadavra."
512,8,"Doesn't work as a standalone movie, but it's still great.","It was known from the start that die-hard fans would complain about the movie. After all, the book is gigantic, and a series of cuts have to be made in order to make the movie work. In general, I'm happy about the decisions Kloves has made about what to cut and what to keep. Granted, there maybe is a little too much focus on the ""hormonal"" part of the story - the kids falling in love and being jealous and so on. But I actually liked this. Not only does it make the movie more humorous and fun - most of the humour courtesy of the ""romance"" between Ron and Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) - but it also develops the main characters and show how fast they have grown. Besides from cutting stuff, though, the filmmakers have made a couple of additions that also work. The film begins with an attack on the Millennium Bridge, which actually makes the presence of evil all the more palpable and imminent - the fact that they are attacking muggles is pretty disturbing. There is also an scene in which the Burrow - the Weasleys' home - is attacked. It is handled well, and serves the same purpose as the opening."
513,5,An entertaining movie without substance or depth,A strong cast and good sets always help the movie and most of the pacing kept everyone entertained. The movie definitely strays from the book and sadly exposes some plot lines that should have been saved until the next movie.
514,7,"Not Without Strengths, But Ultimately Far Too baggy","Genuine and well-staged darkness and visual spectacle can't make up for a baggy running time - the whole film could be 45 or so minutes shorter and sacrifice little in terms of plot or character. The love sub-plots feel like they get in the way; the first hour or so could be half that length; the rest of the film is only marginally less over-long. The strengths are real and effective, but it's hard not to think it could have been more so with more discipline."
515,6,A strong piece of cinema but far too much material is omitted,"Compared to the preceding two movies, The Half-Blood Prince is a lot less cluttered and much easier to follow. The direction, acting and editing are arguably the best of the series so far and I was particularly impressed by Michael Gambon's performance, who has improved with each instalment. There was probably overkill on the teenage romance dynamics but I thought the actors involved in these scenes did a pretty decent job working with that part of the story."
516,7,Dark Potter with a cracking mystery,"The return of the Dark Lord, Voldemort, and the battle of good against evil continues."
517,8,The Magic Continues To Mature,"I have yet to see a ""Harry Potter"" film that didn't impress me; that holds true with ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", the most mature of the lot and perhaps the best written. Continuing with the trend begun in ""The Goblet of Fire"", people will die, Voldemort's army of Death Eaters will make huge strides, and the courage of Harry Potter will be stretched to the limit. The result is another installment that continues to take this nearly perfect film franchise into darker and darker territory. The magical world that was once so whimsical and inviting has become home to unspeakable evils; on screen, this translates to a more realistic and gritty universe, drawing even more relevant comparisons to our own world than the previous installments. Some might be offended by the lack of the glitzy magic tricks that worked so beautifully before; I, however, believe that they would have felt out-of-place here. The magic presented here, more subdued and dramatic, is exactly what ""The Half-Blood Prince needs"". It is a clear sign of the series' maturation."
518,8,"Great Movie, but the book is better","This was one of the better Harry Potter films. I thought the acting and character development was good, as well as the sets, costuming, music and other basics that make a film good. Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) is genius, as always, and Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley) is excellent as well."
519,5,Another entertaining movie,I have just checked over my previous comments of the Harry Potter movies and I've seen all of them at the cinema. Having never read the books I don't really go into the movies with any knowledge other than the a few spoilers that you inevitably pick up.
520,9,I'm actually surprised!,"I used to hate this one every time I would watch it. I found it boring and dull. Now that I have seen it again, I love it! It's not dull at all. There's so many fun elements and it's a great story. I think this movie is amazing and possibly one of the best of the series!"
521,7,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"My least favorite Harry Potter movie, the story was excellent and clearly outperformed the rest of the parts, but it wasn't as enjoyable as the rest of the parts, and the action scenes in the movie weren't at the fifth level. Dumbledore's death was the saddest scene in the entire Harry Potter series."
522,8,A Return To Form,"The sixth of the Harry Potter films is a definite improvement on the previous effort, which was largely static and drab-looking. Director David Yates has learnt from his mistakes, coaxed better performances from the young leads and visually made the movie far more arresting."
523,10,Key Points missing!!!,"If you love the series like I do you will know that in every movie they have to cut parts of the book out. Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating."
524,1,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed by this movie. It cut out a great many important scenes and included insignificant things such as the teenage romance and angst. Where was the battle that was at the end of book? That was the most exciting part of book 6. It was cut to include a part where the Death Eaters burn down the Burrow. That was NOT in the book. What was the point of that? Most of the parts where Harry learns about Voldemort's past life are cut. The Pensieve trips are cut short and the horcruxes are not explained properly. And why does Harry act like a stupid coward hiding under a floorboard while Snape kills Dumbledore? He was supposed to be immobolised under the invisibility cloak!!!!!! This movie was lacking in action and suspense but overflowing with teenage drama that was not central to the plot of the story. As an adaptation of the book it sucked, big time."
525,,boring and bad,"Don't waste your time with this rubbish, if you value your time go and see something else. I don't know where to start-story pathetic, acting horrendous (One day they are going to look back at this guy who played Harry Potter and wonder ""what the?"" he is possibly the biggest geek to grace the planet)the rest of the features of this film aren't worth listing.This whole Harry Potter thing has been done to death, no matter how many fans there are this is clearly a fad that once over will stay over.Its so sad to see heroes now portrayed as little weasels, what horrible role models for children-don't let your kids see it they deserve better."
526,2,"Dumblesnore, Dumblechore, Jumping the Shark with a Dumblebore","Have never read the books (skimmed one), but eventually do see the movies, which have all proved moderately entertaining and coherent, great for kids... until this boring, disjointed mess."
527,9,Terrific Movie - Best Harry Potter movie yet,I'd been waiting to see Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for a very long time and finally July 15th came. For the first time I decided to see a Harry Potter film on the first day of release. This was partly due to how good the previous Potter film was and Warner Brothers certainly managed to gather a lot of hype for this Harry Potter installment.
528,6,The Worst HP Movie !,"(A POTTERHEAD'S REVIEW) ""It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you still have a bit of a security problem David Yates, because you have demonstrated with the sixth instalment to unconditional fans how a great book could end up being nothing more than a basket-case film""."
529,7,Good,"Here's my first thought: The editing lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. As Potter begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is nonetheless powerful."
530,2,Borefest,"Honestly, after watching the entire series recently, I forgot this film existed. It was that forgettable."
531,4,A book readers nightmare,"This movie was a let down. It was my favourite book of the series, but all of the scenes I was looking forward to seeing were done overwhelmingly poorly. It is unfortunate that the movie needed to be tame enough for youngsters to enjoy it, but the movie lacked punch in the vital scenes. The addition of scenes not in the book may have been necessary to complete the plot, but that is not the case for the ""burning of the burrow"" scene. It had no purpose and was disappointing in that the death eaters lured out their prize, then just gave up. What was the point? And since when can they all fly? There seems to be a lot of new fiction to the story that is going to make it interesting to see how they can blend this into an acceptable finale. Seems to be a lot of important plot left out, and senseless waffle included."
532,9,Finally!!!,"The movies have finally matured... just like the characters and the books should mature.... it's about time people realize that you can't expect random wizard duels, useless spell throwing etc.... the sixth installment of the series shows the dark times that have finally arrived, which was dreaded by almost all the wizarding community... also the students have matured physically and mentally and enter into the world of relationships, betrayal, heart-breaks etc... a very well made movie... better than most of the previous ones... the 1st, 2nd and the 4th ones sucked badly... rest all were great... for those complaining about lack of action, go watch transformers.. you won't be disappointed and please don't waste your time and money and then crib or complain about it... true, mature audiences and fans will understand the worth of the movie..."
533,8,Excellent movie but missing adaptation,This review contains spoilers.
534,7,"Overly compressed, but still good...","It was a blissful Thursday night when I went to the theatre eagerly anticipating the new Harry Potter movie. Luckily, the theatre was not overly packed, and I sat down with my customary pack of nachos and sprite to watch an interesting, but flawed movie."
535,5,is this the film you expect after reading the book,iam a great fan of happy potter books and read each book nearly 10 times.and my favorite book being the 6th and i never expected such a kind of film to be taken from my fav book.2 hr 30min time is not enough to take such an wonderful book and it needed to be taken like lord of rings a 4hr movie.comedy is good but movie is not a masterpiece and i expect much more from the movie.movie is not a complete disappointment but can do a lot much better.many action scenes in the book are not included in the movie and the climax of the movie is not good.even if the climax is good it might have covered a lot of negatives in the movie.expecting the 7th part(part 1) a lot much better than this
536,10,So many questions,"This movie leaves you with a lot of questions. But overall it was a good movie. As before, not much attention was paid to the sub-characters. The next movie should be very surprising."
537,4,Ron and Hermione EXTRAS!,"Seriously, what the hell happened with them? They did nothing! I didn't read this book, but i searched about it and... Why they omitted so many things? specially voldemort? "
538,4,Harry Potter is not Twilight,"Another year, another Potter film. Not actually. We've been without a franchise entry for almost two years with no good fantasy film to compensate. Twilight was an inadequate substitute, even if Half-Blood Prince isn't up to series standards. The two movies are, unfortunately, too similar. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is heavily influenced by its contemporary rival. As many hormones jitter around, the film is saved by a surprising dark story."
539,9,Tom Felton deserves so much praise for his performance!,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) follows Harry as he learns more about Voldemort's dark past in order to finally defeat him. This film really sets up the final films well and has a high level of tension, the atmosphere is incredibly moody!"
540,,Just like the book,"As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his pals begin their sixth year at Hogwarts, the forces of the Dark Lord are wreaking havoc on Londoners, both wizards and Muggles alike. Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to do a mysterious job for him, while Voldemort has apparently given Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) a rather unsavory task. Amid all this gloom and doom, young love has struck the Hogwarts student body and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all under its spell."
541,7,Malfoy Shines,"I don't mind the lighthearted stuff, but it is suppose to be dark. There are dark moments but I wish we see more Tom Riddle history. However, the Ron and Hermione sexual tension become obvious. Since Ginny is older and cuter, Harry starts noticing her. I also wish there have been more Harry and Ginny scenes.<br /><br />But, I find myself invested in Draco because this is where we see his vulnerable side. After this, my opinion has changed I used to not like him but now I feel sorry for him, and I cry when he cries he's under pressure. This is Draco Malfoy's moment."
542,3,1-3 for kids 4 & 5 kids and adults,"But this installment (also the weakest book) becomes incredibly and nauseatingly ""Tweenish""."
543,5,Setup for the final 2 in the series,"HP6 is the Empire Strikes Back of the J.K. Rowling series because it is largely a setup for the final Potter/Voldemort showdown in book 7. Along the way Dumbledore dies somewhat needlessly, the main characters discover sex, and the dark side, er Death Eaters strike back over the course of two and half and plus hours of beautifully rendered cinematography that comes off a little too perfect (the set dressers needed to dirty up Diagon Alley a bit for realism?s sake). For what the book had to the offer David Yates does a credible job (imagine what Terry Gilliam?s take would have been had he accepted the offer) with the exception of omitting the ending battle between the castle-storming Death Eaters and its residents. Poor Malfoy spends the whole movie repairing the vanishing cabinet only to see his compatriots waltz out the front door after Snape takes out Dumbledore. Beyond this Rowling?s comprehensive vision shines through."
544,8,Better than Order of the Phoenix thankfully,"I didn't find the story in the Order of the Phoenix that intriguing and I was hoping this movie wouldn't be like that which it wasn't thankfully. The first few minutes of the movie were a bit dull, but after that it started to pick up and story was interesting until the end. I liked the tone of the movie and the way it was filmed which gave a mysterious vibe that matched with the mysterious story. There were more funnier moments than usual probably not seen since the first two movies which I liked. Can't wait to see the last two movies which I have high hopes for because of how good this movie was."
545,8,This is a real step up as the series approaches the near end,Rating-8/10
546,8,Wow......,"Talk about memorable moments. Wow, this film is full of them. While the story can sometimes go slow, the high points are super high. The characters all create a dark but delightful feel. The magic is dark but whimsical. The tragedies in this film are very much there. The Half-Blood Prince is definitely darker than the other five for sure. The twist in the film was completely out of nowhere, and really makes you rethink everything you saw in the franchise before. The special effects work better, even though they don't use much of it. Overall this was a great addition once more to the fantastic franchise known as Harry Potter."
547,6,It's Not Bad But Not Great,"I think we need Alfonso Cuaron back & maybe another screenplay writer. I always liked Lawrence Kasdan's work. How about him? (If he's still alive, that is). If he isn't, bummer."
548,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Like James Bond, the Harry Potter movies just keep chugging along, immune to the outside cinematic world, ensconced in their universe of quidditch and muggles, inferi and death eaters. They have perfectly fitted their source material from day one: each arriving regularly with a thud on the doormat every year or so since 2001, achieving a near-institutional status that has eluded the Narnia adaptations."
549,7,Some of this seems tired,Let me start by saying that I'm not a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I've seen all of the films but I've never read the books. 
550,6,"Way better than OoTP, Yates, but you still have A LOT to learn...","If the human history is divided by the AC and DC periods, the HP's movies can be divided by the AY and DY periods.In the AY period, the worst vote that I give to a HP movie was to CoS, 7. In the DY period, this is the BEST vote that I give. I don't know what happen to J.K. Rowlling to approved this.Anyway, HBP is not a bad movie, way better than the weakness OoTP, but cut the Dumbledore's visit to Harry, almost all of the memories and the matches, the battle at the end and the Harry's relationship with Ginny is most unforgivable than the Avada Kedavra.The acting is good, but not exceed expectations ( by the way, why cut the letters with the Nom's results ? The scene of McGonagall conversation with Harry was confused for who not read the book because of this, don't you think ? ).Outstanding just for the Visual Effects. "
551,9,one of the best films of the saga,"I will never tire of watching this movie, it is just really too good. The mystery of the half-blood prince that remains throughout the whole film is very engaging and exciting, the relationship between ron and hermione is full of ups and downs that make the narrative super interesting, the cloud that hovers over draco and all his mysterious scenes give to those who are watching the desire to continue watching the film, to see how all the pieces of the puzzle will fit together. Needless to say that probably my favorite part, because it is cinematically extraordinary and emotionally super engaging, are the last scenes where there are the last missions of Harry and Professor Dumbledore. I recommend everyone to see it, even to those who have already seen it to see it again because it gives a lot of emotions."
552,7,A good piece of cinema,A Harry Potter film is never going to win Oscars. But that is not to say Rowling's material cannot be adapted into satisfying cinema. In my opinion that is what happened here.
553,7,"Not my favorite Harry Potter, but still fun and I enjoyed watching it","I remember watching this in theaters with a friend, and by the time the movie was over and we were having dinner together, she fired a whole bunch of questions at me about the plot. She never read the books but she did enjoy the previous movies and was asking me about what she missed. I was happy to fill her in on the details. This is one of those school drama type of films but it's dark and funny both. There were some scenes that were changed, but at least Luna Lovegood was back and we get to see her doing more. It's not a bad film, but it's my least favorite of the film saga along with Goblet of Fire. Still, it wasn't bad to watch in theaters."
554,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) - Collect All the Horcruxes!,"The sixth installment of the hit phenomenon introduces itself as ""The Half-Blood Prince"". Now, different from the other movies in the series, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is maybe one of the many Potter flicks to have great characters, visual effects, cinematography, and many moments of drama and suspense. But this movie contains separation from some of the important characters in this movie, and only a few moments in the film made no point. Also, some moments in the film felt like I was watching another episode of ""Gossip Girl"". But there were also positive comments on the film that included: Jim Broadbent's new performance, the neat visual effects, the cool cinematography, the new and improved storyline, and let's not forget that the Malfoy character has reached a more darker side to the role. Well, I'm not saying the movie is bad, I'm just saying the movie was cool and powerful, but some moments kind of made a fool out of the film. Well, sometimes we just have to understand what the Potter films will bring next. But I still think the movie was well-interesting, and it's another personal favorite film in the series. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", in my review, ""thrilling fun, but with feelings of satire""."
555,8,Recommended,"I like to read reviews of certain movies after the come out; this being one of them, as I read the first two or three pages of reviews on here and on other websites, it's striking at how many people dislike the movie (even though they did watch -- unlike some people who will merely give a move a low grade or even negative comments -- without actually watching the movie, but just to bring down it's overall score). The actual critics are generally very positive about this movie, saying nice things about. So are many on here, myself included (although my rating is actually closet to 8.5 than 9 but not low enough to just be an 8)."
556,8,An Eventful Magical Experience,"It was with a sigh of relief when David Yates gained renewed directorial confidence in his second Harry Potter film - ""The Half-Blood Prince"". A continued refinement of the darker aspect made by the producers, which emphasises more on depth. A gripping gloom without sticky sentimentality with wonderfully imaginative aesthetics and beauty, supported by a fantastic storytelling craft. And is one of the most exciting and humorous film out of the series,"
557,5,Ending makes no sense - what's with the Death Eaters?,Spoiler alert.
558,6,Merlin's Beard! How you've grown.,"As we have seen with the opening sequence of Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) and its metaphor for reaching puberty, the experimenting stages of Order of the Phoenix (2007) has the team in discussions of love and snogging. Now, the Half Blood Prince has truly set the foundations for the Harry Potter clan to now fully transcended adolescences by taking the next step that is young adulthood. It has been a long and sweet journey since the oh so sweet little darlings of The Philosopher's Stone (2001) first stepped into the limelight. The Harry Potter world has finally flowered."
559,1,Boring and without suspense,"Worst HP move thus far. While the opening scene was a thrilling 3-D like ride which should be seen at an OmniMax, the 3 minutes or so it lasted were definitely not enough to sustain my interest. There was absolutely no suspense. The notion that heroic Harry would be crushing on Ginny is sad, but writing likable, but dense and goofy Ron as the brilliant and beautiful Hermoine's crush is a ridiculous and intentional anti-Romantic ploy that simply does not work -- though that is the author's fault. Sorry, but pathetic Ron doesn't even qualify as a starter boyfriend for Hermoine. The characters' respective love interests are totally lacking in credibility of any kind and serve only as distasteful distractions from the extremely boring plot. I started checking my watch within 45 minutes, hoping the 2 1/2 hour movie was almost over. C'est la vie. At least I didn't pay for the ticket!"
560,7,"It's A Good-Enough Adaptation, But Makes Some Really Bizarre Changes And Additions. But Is Still An Enjoyable Movie In Its' Own Right","Pros:<br /><br />1. The humour is well-timed whilst serving as great character bonding, which is needed to balance out the overall dark themes.<br /><br />2. The score fantastically creates the relevant atmosphere with it being brooding and heavy for the dark moments, but fluffy and light for the upbeat moments.<br /><br />3. The special effects look incredible and have come a very long way since 2001.<br /><br />4. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) is palpable and it shines through in every scene they're in together.<br /><br />5. The sound design and mixing are wonderful, therefore helping the wizarding world come to life.<br /><br />6. The set and costume design, per usual, are immaculate and - like point 5 - help bring the Harry Potter world to life.<br /><br />7. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) deliver great performances.<br /><br />8. The death of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is exceedingly tense, tragic and emotional. It's one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the entire franchise."
561,9,Yet Another Great Harry Potter Film,"David Yates, in my opinion, is Harry Potter's best director, because his movies in this series are dark, more serious, yet still contain a bit of laughter and humour. I think this was quite a nice film to watch, very effective lighting and graphics, a script that was light and enjoyable, and frentic tension near the end."
562,7,A magical disappointment,"The Half Blood prince, the sixth and latest adaptation from Harry Potter's books in my opinion was the lamest and most disappointing movie of all six. At least the previous five has tons of action, adventure and humor. But this one is two hours and a half of the same boredom story. It is a flat plot that never advances and the lame excuse or romance make the film ridiculously cheesy. The very few of special effects that the movie has were very good. The cast were good but their performances in comparison to the previous movies were a little weak, I don't know but I never felt any emotion in them. The only ones that were convincing enough were Alan Rickman as Snape, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and the very little appearance of Helena Bonham Carter. In conclusion, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince for me is the biggest disappointment of the summer and even the year."
563,8,Peak Potter,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is peak Potterverse. It fully accepts its darker tone, bringing harmony to the experience. The technicals remain strong (possibly the strongest yet), the writing is consistent, and the acting is noticeably vulnerable. The theme is focused, the loss is genuinely painful, and the storylines converge neatly. Its ending feels slightly incomplete because the story isn't a standalone, but that's forgivable since everything else is effectively written. Plus, Rickman and Felton are layered, Gambon shows pain, and Radcliffe delivers a ranged performance. A welcome departure from its lighthearted beginnings, Half-Blood Prince embraces itself."
564,1,This Movie is a Travesty. Don't Let Your Kids Be Brainwashed by This Drek,Its just terrible. The acting is choppy. Dumbledore has lost his charm. Hes not funny or original hes gay. The old dumbledore was gay but he was mad good too i think i could act better than this guy. Harry has a strained relationship with harmoney. I never was the biggest fan of harry potter but i enjoyed his early years. He was all over the place doing cool s$1T with cool people like haggard and fred and george. Everyone has lost their charm. 
565,7,"A Pretty Bad Adaptation Of The Novel, But Surprisingly Well Made.","After how destroyed I thought ""Order of the Phoenix"" (2007) was, I had my doubts on seeing this one. This book is very important as it reveals a lot about the villain Lord Voldemort's past, and how things have escalated to this point as the penultimate in the series."
566,7,Pleasantly surprised,"I was very pleased with the way the series has continued with 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'. After the (in my opinion) miserable almost-failures that the fourth and fifth films were, I expected no better of the sixth. But the sixth movie is energetic, funny, coherent, and actually sticks to the book fairly well. There are, however some deficiencies, so let me get those out of the way first."
567,7,The Big Set-up for the final films,"From my point of view, this movie and the book, are used for us to receive the necesarry information to understand the final book or movies, I say this because the movie is mostly character development throught their relationships and telling us about the objects the protagonists are going to collect in the next movies. It is certainly not done in a bad way, the movie is very entertaining but there was a moment where I was just expecting for something to happend. It did at the final part of the movie and it was really shocking but I was already a little tiny bit tired. As I said, the devolopment and how they stablish stuff is good and I understand it was necesarry but still, mega enjoyable."
568,,"The double disk version has something that is very worthwhile, v 1.01","With HP 6, the second disk includes a 47 minute documentary based on interviews with JKR. For me this is the big thing about the HP 6 DVD release. The main disk is just the feature and normally that would be the one that I purchased the DVD for. "
569,7,Harry Potter meets 90210,"Okay, so the first thing you should know is that the plot of this movie at once consists of no more than what was seen in the trailer AND will make no sense without a firm knowledge of the other books and/or films. The bulk of the picture is made up of Ginny Weasley making strong sexual advances on Mr. Potter, and Hermione Granger being pi$$ed off at Ron for some reason that only women seem to understand, making for one very long soap opera, with the occasional bit of magic. This seems to be the movie in the series where they take a break from advancing the plot in any meaningful way (with the exception of Dumbledore's well reported moment) and concentrate on the difficulties of being young and in love, and somehow it works. This may be my favourite HP pic thus far (although Fiennes' turn in 4 gives it a good run for it's money) and it is definitely the funniest, and it's only rarely unintentionally so. Props to Jim Broadbent for carrying on the long standing tradition of lending some emotional weight to the series, and almost making it seem as if the younger members of the cast can act. Almost. This movie is pure filler before things really get going. If you like HP you'll like this, if you don't you won't, simple as that."
570,7,The best Potter film spoilt by a confused ending,"Harry Potter and the half-blood prince is the sixth film in the HP series and is directed by Order of the phoenix director David Yates. After six films based on the same storyline I would expect to have been bored by now. However, Director David Yates has tried his hardest to make each of his films different and it is definitely clear here."
571,8,Very Good,This was Good movie I liked it a lot it's way to long drags through half of the movie but it was still a lot of fun
572,4,Completely misses to convey the mood from the book,"I was looking forward this movie for ages. Couldn't wait to buy a ticket and get engrossed in a great story. Unfortunately, the 2,5-hour experience left me totally disappointed. The movie completely misses to convey the tightening darkness and despair in the wizards' world, and the much darker atmosphere of the book."
573,3,Does Not Do The Book Justice,"I have been a fan of the Harry Pottter books ever since they came out. Having read all of the books and sees all of the movies, I honestly have to say that the Half Blood Prince is easily the worst of the Harry Potter films by a country mile."
574,,Who is the bigger genius?,"I'm still not sure how to rate that movie. 8/10, 9/10 or 10/10? Somehow I didn't feel very satisfied at the end. I was missing a little more... i don't know, but there was this certain something that was missing."
575,7,The unmasking of a professor,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) is the second film in the series directed by David Yates, and is again marked by the darkness intruding the light."
576,9,Definitely a must see,"I'm not going to make any comments about the directions etc on here, all I want to do is tell you why this film should be seen! I went along to this film, not with the greatest expectations, as the other ones have only been average, but I had had a pleasant surprise. This is easily the best of the Harry Potter films so far."
577,8,A Masterful Adaptation: A Review of 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a spellbinding and emotional installment in the beloved Harry Potter franchise. From the stunning visuals to the impeccable performances, this movie truly delivers on every front. The film's story is rich and complex, delving deeper into the wizarding world and providing a closer look at the inner turmoil of its characters. The acting is top-notch, with particular praise going to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint for their outstanding performances. The pacing is perfect, with the movie seamlessly transitioning between action and emotion. Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a must-see film for any Harry Potter fan and a cinematic masterpiece in its own right. ""Brilliantly cast, emotionally charged, and visually stunning. The Half-Blood Prince is a potion of pure magic"""
578,3,disgusting,"After I saw this movie I just felt disgusted. Not disgusted by the teenage girls behind that where giggling throughout the movie. Not disgusted by the director which obviously thought Ron's love life was more important then Harry's journey through Tom Riddle's life. Not disgusted by the fact that certain key things got left out of the movie like Bill and Fleur, Scrimgeour, the massive action packed end fight or Dumbledore's funeral or the fact that Greyback was in fact not just a regular death dealer but a werewolf, which are not just critical parts of book 6's story but also critical for book 7. Not disgusted seeing everyone in the theater looking around with a WTF expression when the Death Dealers come and burn the burrow which will create another problem for the director of part 7. Not disgusted by the fact that the main focus group was girls of the age of 12-16. No I felt sad about all that, what I felt disgusted by was MYSELF because I had helped fund this piece of garbage and no matter how much I regret paying for my ticket, they already have my money, I also regret the fact that I already KNOW I'm going to 7 just in the off chance that they won't **** it up like they did with this movie."
579,5,Harry Potter and a half made movie from a half read book...,"It was dark, the movie just finished and I keep Wondering: why? Why they skipped all Voldemort's life? It wasn't important? there's no need to know why the bad guy is that way? And what about Ron's Brother? And what happened with the school's fight? it looks awesome in the book! Why did they do things like this? Why Dumbledore didn't freeze Harry? he looks like a coward in this movie. I guess that nobody read the whole book before start making the film, that's the only and possible reason to skip ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS of the book. I just didn't like it. I hope they will fix some things now they have decided to ""split"" the last book in two movies... another reason to hate this kind of ""foreword"" to the last two parts. why?"
580,7,A Bit Of A Step Back,A bit of a step back from its predecessor as the script chooses a meandering path through the story by indulging in borderline unnecessary fan-service subplots of blossoming loves & Quidditch matches.
581,6,disappointing...an average take on a brilliant story,"I expected Harry potter-the half blood prince to be the thriller, with all the history Voldemort's life and the dark world. Sadly, its just turned out to be an average take on the JK Rowling book, with Lavender Brown getting more frames than even Hermione."
582,4,Not Just Half-Blooded But Anaemic,"The sixth round in the ongoing fight between pubescent wizard Harry and ugly Lord Voldemort, formerly known as Tom Riddle, is even weaker than its numerous predecessors, lacking some of the earlier movies' visual wit and superficial charm while emphasizing the well-known shortcomings that hampered all installments: variable performances, sketchy and episodic narration and arbitrarily twisty (and often downright silly) story lines based on a hodgepodge of ancient and contemporary cultural mythology."
583,2,Nice bloopers summary or left-out scenes collection...,"First I wanna say sorry in advance for all those who gave this film more than 6 stars AND didn't know the book. I presume that all the others who actually DID read the novel first gave a bad critic cuz otherwise, i really suggest you to stop reading."
584,5,Yates still doesn't get it,"Yates's style still annoys me. He's trying to force fantasy literature into action. With Yates directing it seems that the grim visual side and ""action"" is more important than the actual story. And again, the idea of a dark fantasy story is making the movie so dark it's hard to see. That kind of aesthetic only suits David Fincher, and Yates is nowhere near his brilliance."
585,8,"Decent, but a bit muffled","This installment of the series is strong in its portrayal of darker moments, the conflict of Harry, and of the uncertainty of Snape's motives. However, it was surprising to see the heavy focus on romantic triangles that were not so much a focus in the novel, though it did seem like there was an emphasis to draw a parallel of commitment in a relationship to the commitments that characters like Snape made to follow through with the plan set forth by Voldemort and executed by the Death Eaters. Additionally, the portryal of a particular death seemed very quick and without emotion, like the directors and producers were expecting to not have to focus on that moment much because they perhaps assumed that the majority of the film's watchers would have already been emotionally influenced through the event by having already read the book. If that was their assumption, that was a mistake. The dark emphasis was good, but glazed over story lines and key events from the book make it a film that serves only to tell the story, but ought not to be remembered as anything legendary by any means."
586,9,They missed by just a bit:,"This is the first time in this series where I can honestly say that the movie was every bit as good as the book... though, for different reasons. You see, there is not all that much adventure and action sequences in the book so, while it doesn't drag because the characters are and plot development is outstanding, it still felt a bit on the long side. This caters perfectly for the movie. The challenges in fitting in all sorts of scenes are completely different than those in fitting in various emotions, which is what they faced when making this movie. In capturing those emotions, thoughts, moments of internal conflict, etc. they did a fantastic job. The only thing I thought they could've done a better job of was making Dumbledore's exit a bit more emotional like it was in the book. Still though, they did a great job there in general so that's not the reason I didn't give it a perfect ten. That reason lies with the fact that they hinted towards things in this movie that were not so profound in the book. I have not finished the final book yet so I can only speculate on some of the things I was already wondering but it seems as though, regarding Severus Snape, that they took advantage of knowing the ending of the entire story rather than the particular book itself. By knowing this, it seems as though they hint a little more at certain elements of the story than the book did causing you to think entirely differently about the act that took place. Nonetheless, this movie was still outstanding and I look forward to watching the final one(s)."
587,8,Gets better despite... it's ending,"Simply put, unfortunately there is a death in the film a bit more significant than the last time. However, there was just as many good scenes and happy moments as well."
588,7,The magic may have worn off in Order of the Phoenix but i don't remember it being so funny.,The magic that made this series a family movie would have disappeared in Goblet of Fire when it got dark. But Harry Potter still has a little bit of magic still left in it. Half Blood Prince brings the story into full circle as we draw nearer to the massive finale of one of the biggest series in movie history.
589,3,huge disappointment just anti-climatic,I was really looking forward to seeing this as i thought maybe after the order film was such a disappointment and just felt like a filler but watched this and found it to be exactly the same when dumbledoor and harry are at the place where he has to drink the poison i started to think great getting darker and there's going to be a good climax to the film but it just when down hill i mean when dumbledoor dies its basically malfoy not having the balls to do it and snape comes along and poof bye bye dumbledoor even everyones reaction to this is so mundane. The last 2 films have basically nothing happen in them and try to hard to appeal to everyone. If the film ended at the death would of been OK ...ended on a bummer a bit more hard hitting but it had to end with some mushyness which brings it right back down to 5 year old friendly and this overambitious nature of the film just ruins it. It needs to choose a more niche audience and have things actually happen.
590,1,Extremely Disappointing,How anyone could enjoy this film after reading the books is beyond me. Some extremely mediocre acting throughout with Gambon spearheading with a dreadful Dumbledore. Again i feel that the board behind the films at still hurting by the bad choice of casting in Daniel Radcliffe that can obviously not act...
591,8,"Love, War, and Crappy Romance for Harry Potter",I went to the theater with a bit of excitement for the sixth Harry Potter film. Being a BIG fan of the Harry Potter books and being very disappointed (understatement) by the fourth (shudder)and fifth film I want this one to be the one to change the hope for Harry Potter films. It came close yet not so close. Harry Potter book fans prepare to be in a dull treatment from the film and average film goers prepare to enjoy the epic movie. 
592,,faith restored,"This is a better Potter than we've known, with one big exception: the Quidditch sequence. From shot to shot, the blocking is almost completely borrowed from equivalent material in earlier stories. The only revision by this director is a slow-mo posturing from the characters on their broomsticks, which I guess is meant to be funny but feels embarrassingly like the Coke ads that play when you enter the theater."
593,9,best film of the year,It sucks that I have 6 months to go before I can even think to say that again
594,3,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Movie - prepare to be disappointed !,"I am not a Harry Potter fan, nor have I read any of the books. But my daughter, son and myself have seen several, though not all, of the films. Some have been more gripping than others, but all have been enjoyable and it has been great to have seen my kids grow up with Harry Potter."
595,,"Best Harry Potter film up to that point, I'd say","Although I don't quite understand how director David Yates could say no to the amazing cinematic possibility of using the conversation with the Muggle Prime Minister and the Minister for Magic as the film's introduction the way J.K. Rowling did in the novel, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince still impresses with very interesting opening shots, as we see the Death Eaters wreaking havoc even outside the boundaries of Harry Potter's increasingly dark magical world. This gives a first hint that the sixth movie in the franchise sets out to be the darkest and most dramatic one yet."
596,3,Story is king. But not in this movie.,"As has been said before, this is a really bad Harry Potter installment. Just viewers can throw away Star Wars-Episode I and not miss anything, this Harry Potter film does not have to be purchased and you will not miss anything."
597,4,Disappointing,"Although I enjoyed this movie, I think it was meant more to amuse fans who choose to not read the books but to watch the movies instead. Having read from the 3rd book to the end I have obviously realized that under time restrictions they must pull some things out. Usually there are a couple big things left out, Prisoner of Azkaban they failed to explain that James and his friends were the creators of the Marauder's Map, Goblet of Fire left out the fact that Rita Skeeter was an unregistered Animagus which should have been relevant in Order of the Phoenix when he does his interview with her (which was also left out). Those being some things as well as a lot of House Elf scenes and S.P.E.W, Pigwideon, challenges in the World Cup, etc. As disappointing as some of those things were I would have to say that Half Blood Prince was EASILY the most disappointing. How do you take out the fight scene at Hogwarts when Dumbledore dies and yet ADD a completely irrelevant scene about the Burrow. The fact that Harry had no curiosity as to who the HBP actually was unlike the book got me annoyed. Was it necessary to make the film PG and cut many of the action scenes and put so much emphasis on the love theme of the book. Worse than leaving things out in my opinion is when they COMPLETELY change things from the book to the movie. Why have Luna find Harry on the train with no explanation when Tonks clearly explained how she found Harry in the book. Even main characters were pretty much taken out of the movie. DID NEVILLE HAVE ONE WORD IN THE FILM!? I don't think so. Would it have been terrible to explain more of what was going on in the Muggle word as far as Dementors go rather then having the first couple minutes showing Harry flirting with a waitress. After I read Half Blood Prince I don't think I ever thought of any character in anything of more of a dirtbag than I thought Snape was. I thought it was creepy how Voldemort grew up. I didn't feel that after the movie. Was Dumbledores arm even scratched in this movie? After reading I was truly scared of Fenrir Greyback's character. Not the same feeling at the end of HBP as they didn't even explain who he was, although he was scary looking. The scene when they showed Draco going into B&B was completely changed as well, in the book he talked about the vanishing cabinet while Harry Ron and Hermione were listening via Extendable Ears. Instead they decided this would be Draco's initiation as a Death Eater. The action, storyline, and emphasis on certain things was VERY poorly done in this film. The only times I felt at all suspenseful was during the death of Dumbledore and the Inferi scene. I didn't know the Harry Potter's was supposed to be turned into a Romantic Comedy. Unfortunately the last two films won't be done any better because the directors will see how many people went to see the film and think, ""Oh we must have done an amazing job on this one."""
598,7,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""","Director David Yates' second venture into J.K. Rowling's world, ""Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince,"" is an occasionally magical film in both its content and its effect. Built with an eye for the fantastic, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is loose and airy, and Yates is adept at grounding and making accessible the supernatural world. ""The Half-Blood Prince,"" is a technically impressive but inherently imperfect film that corrects some of the series' longstanding problems, but stumbles over just as many others."
599,9,Authentic Work of Pure Art,"HBP is an authentic work of pure art...that is saying a lot for any movie of the grand Harry Potter franchise. Director Yates has done a remarkable work and has transformed the children-friendly series into a dark political-based thriller revolving around the theme of the wizarding world. And what's more, he has done this momentous task by staying remarkably true to the source material."
600,7,Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens."
601,8,Deeply mysterious,"This movie, about Harry Potter who begins his sixth year at Hogwarts, where he discovers an old book marked as ""the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past, is such a great sixth installment of the Harry Potter octalogy (2001-2011)."
602,7,Disjointed,"I have hailed the previous movies in the past for taking creative liberties, that are not in the book. For making a film stand alone, deriving an over arching story from a book."
603,7,Harry Potter & The Half Blood Prince Film Review By Rhett Black,"Darker, stronger & more magical. The Harry Potter Film franchise continues to get better with each installment. Forget the fact that the movie is never as good as the book. You can't get much closer than this. Books are 700 pages long & whilst virtually impossible to quote the book word for word, The Half Blood Prince takes the best from the text & puts it onto the screen with a bang. Harry & Dumbledore finally adventure together as a team in attempt to defeat Voldemort whilst the School Of Hogwarts is under attack by his army. Possibly the best of all six films so far & will be hard to top again surely. Explores Tom Riddle well as a boy but could have used Ralph Fiennes in some form during the film as Voldemort or earlier. Maybe next film??"
604,9,Favourite in the Series,"The reason why love Half Blood Prince above all (and mind you I have read the books much later) is because this film thematically defines the Wizarding World (cinematic universe, of course) which we know today. Before that every other film is thematically very distinct. Even certain films were idealogically separate. But after HBP the whole film found its own voice. Although I know that even the books do change their tone as they mature. But the films with Half Blood Prince finds a new humor and resonance between characters which kind of becomes the central theme later in Fantastic Beasts also. I for one love this shift, especially after Order of Phoenix being so dark."
605,8,Half Blood Prince Review,As Harry (Danielle Radcliffe) begins his 6th year at Hogwarts Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) needs him to help retrieve a piece of information. Professor Slughorn (Jim BroadBent) got particularly close with Tom Riddle when he was his professor and Tom had asked him for help. While getting to know Slughorn Harry finds a potions book belonging to the Half Blood Prince.
606,4,I spend 210 minutes in the cinema to get mentally molested.,"I have no clue why this film has such a high rating on IMDb. There are many movies that are way better than Harry Potter 6 and though they have a way lower rating. Actually I read all the books. While growing up I distanced myself from the fantasy world the books tried to build. Especially the 6th and the 7th book weren't that exciting anymore like the other 5 ones. Still they were cool to read and the storyline fitted. Action combined with the magic part, human relations, some cute weirdness all that getting expressed by a good vs. bad story. To sum it up: worth its reading time. I watched the first 3 movies and I was disappointed but with the 4th and the 5th movie it felt like the movies were getting better, they had at least more elements of the books in a acceptable balance as their forerunner. So I thought this one could be finally worth it to be called a Harry Potter movie. I was wrong...or better I was terribly wrong. It kinda reminded me of an adult movie, just that they only showed the plot and no explicit scenes. To summarize it they tried to be closer to the book this time by combining the ""human relations"" and ""cute weirdness"" and made a movie out of it. They kinda cut out everything else, there was like 5 minutes of magic and 5 minutes of action in the movie. It felt like they took the action scenes from the book that were described on like 50 sites and reduced them to 1 site, in the desperate urge to keep the movie on its love-boat-trip and to never risk the rated 12 approval. Sadly this movie kinda feels like a Twilight clone and I guess that the success of this explicit movie by girls in puberty made the producers of Harry Potter 6 cut The Half-Blood Prince the Twilight way: Combine a low amount of fantasy with a high amount of teenage love. After all it was like with the first 3 movies - they were just after the profit, disregarding in any way what they are doing to the books..."
607,6,Less Fuzzy Wuzzy; More Rowling Validity.,"I know we were all excited for this film. Everyone was just so giddy and excited. So when we got to see all the actors we've been watching for years, finally start playing the field- we loved it! But I think we all forgot that the book wasn't meant to be portrayed like this. It's a dark world and this has a dark storyline. They completely cut out every fight scene and any other negative stuff and replaced it with romantic garbage. This book was powerful and you really got the sense of how horrible things were getting for Harry and the rest of the world. I remember my heart breaking when reading the book because Rowling portrayed so well how angry, lonely, scared, and doubtful Harry was having just lost some of the most important people in his life and knowing the fate of the world rests completely with him. Did you get that from the movie?"
608,7,fantasy film,"This movie is a fantasy film I like that part when Harry ,Hermione ,Rony and dumbledor go to the cite because never on the harry potter films the people never go aut of the castel just on the hollidays."
609,8,Interesting movie,"Half Blood Prince is a very interesting novel and this movie is good as well.The ending is very sad.Snape has the biggest moment in this movie right at the ending and Alan Rickman did it very good.The rest of the cast does a good job.Very good movie.8/10<br /><br />One thing which I found weird is why they made Deathly Hallows into two movies.It would make more sense with Order of the Phoenix,which is the longest book in the series."
610,5,Not for novel fans,I get the impression that the people who gave this film good ratings aren't fans of the books...and that the converse is true also. I come into the second category.
611,10,darker it gets,"I have seen these films around 25 times since first out including seeing each one at the cinema at least 3 times (apart from prisoner of Azkaban which i saw 7 times in the Cinema)...i do class myself an avid potter fan or as some are called a 'potter head' but one thing i do get annoyed about is the constant rants on reviews that its nothing like the book or not everything is in the film from the book. can we make it pretty darn clear that with any film that comes from a book it does always say 'BASED ON THE BOOK ----- BY -----' is that not a clue people....based on.... just think before you write such reviews and also because you have read the books it does not mean you are a better fan or reviewer than me or those that have not read the book, to be honest i can find nothing more boring than reading a fiction book."
612,8,The calm before the storm....,"This movie is certainly a lot darker than the previous Harry Potter outings, and in many ways you feel it's the calm before the storm..."
613,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Review,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film directed by David Yates. I was quite excited to watch this chapter of the film as it was the one that was closer to the final 2 chapters. And I can say it was an entertaining venture.
614,1,"Best book, worst movie",This movie lacks subtlety. It's just one sequence after the other in a mad race whose goal is quantity rather than quality. 
615,9,best,"Harry potter is one of the most outstanding movie of all time.man i just ca not express my feelings that how much i love HR.when i watch it for the first time in 2016 i just totally amazed with this kind of movie and and i totally obsessed with it every time.what a story,characters,settings and especially daniel radcliff's acting.what a amazing movie this is.naive and innocent acting of daniel radclifff's makes me humble every time.each characters each and every character is lovable.what a movie is this."
616,3,What the hell was that??????,"I can't begin to say how much of a huge fan I am of the whole HP series and I was so looking forward to this film. I went to see it the morning of it's release with 2 friends and we were all so disappointed with how the film had been adapted (more to the point NOT adapted from the book). Scenes that were never in the book were put in and very important scenes (so important the next film/films won't make sense) in the book were left out!!!!! The most important scene of all was the big fight at the end of the book. WHERE IS IT!! One of the key scenes to introduce important key characters for the last film/films and it was like it never existed. Also the random scenes they put in could have been left out as they weren't relevant or important. These could have been replaced with the final fight scene. The film was also extremely scattered, there was no flow it came across random and as if no-one was bothered to honour the book respectably. The only thing that saved this film was the acting, however, I felt the Lavender Brown character was played well but written like a love sick puppy. It's supposed to be a thriller not a chick flick!"
617,7,Lacks... But Has a Strong Finish,"This film felt very long... felt different from the other films in the Harry Potter series. It gave off a sense of danger, but just took so long to get to the action. I'm giving this a 7/10 just for the strong finish."
618,7,Still very good,"There is a nagging feeling throughout this film that they are trying to just get to the real stuff in Deathly Hallows. The finale feels rushed, particularly for fans of the book, as the movie omits one of the most loved lines in the series. Performances are again excellent across the board, particularly from Tom Felton, who brings new depth to the newly conflicted Draco. Radcliffe is hilarious as Harry feels the effects of Liquid Luck. Not the best Harry film, but still very good 7/10."
619,9,Funny and darker,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the sixth film in the franchise and begins the end of a series of epic films in a Harry Potter movie franchise."
620,10,Absolutely Fantastic!,An absolutely delightful addition to the series.
621,4,The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment!,"The Half-Blood Prince Movie was a HUGE disappointment! :( It was utter nonsense! I don't know what crazy people wrote the script and story line for the movie, but it was completely at ends with the book. This might sound like a harsh review, but I'm sure they could have done a better job if they just put more effort -- after all, they did postpone the movie from last November until the middle of July. That's a good half a year! They could have edited much more within that huge gaping time span."
622,10,"Please, don't go into this movie looking for the book.","I want to make sure that everyone understands that I am an avid reader of the books. I have read them all 6-7 times through. The last time I had read book 6 was two days ago, in preparation for the film. I regret this slightly, as I was constantly reminded throughout the film that this was not the book, but was the best that the screenwriters could do with the time limit they were given."
623,8,"A good film, but the least stand-alone entry in the Potter franchise","All in all, I enjoyed the film. There is an avant-garde feel to this chapter which has been evident in places in the previous films, but this is the first full-on attempt to make something more than pop fare. My review will come from strictly a movie knowledge of the franchise."
624,7,Thumbs up for the action and drama! But thumbs (and toes) down for too much romance.,"I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week."
625,1,Not Fair to the Book Lovers,"After the previous Harry Potter films generating an unimaginable amount of money isn't it only fair for the men, women and children who have read the books to expect an epic portrayal of one of the greatest fantasy books ever written?"
626,5,Harry Potter and the Half-Cooked Film,"Like many millions of other people out there I have read the book of the Half-Blood Prince but unlike most I found the book to be a little plodding and too talkative, but with an action packed and exciting ending that left me, strangely, wanting more. Now that the film is out for release I didn't hesitate to go and see it because, quite frankly, I think the films are better than the books."
627,7,A fine companion to the book: EXCELLENT for two thirds of the way,"As good a time as is to be had for fans and those new to the Harry Potter world, it's difficult not to be a bit let down after last night's supposed Premier midnight showing of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE - suggested by the book which was the emotional climax of the wonderful series (even though it would take one more blockbuster book to resolve the main story lines)."
628,7,Too much snogging and not enough passion...,"They cut all of the heart out of this movie. After reading the comments here, I'm even MORE disappointed in this movie, because I had rushed through HBP in order to read Deathly Hallows back in 2007. The movie, on it's own, is very good. But huge important scenes from the book were left out (Voldemort back story too brief), completely stupid scenes put in (the Weasley's house) and the ending was bland and anticlimactic when it should have been deeply moving. Another reviewer commented on the lack of applause at the end, I noticed that too in my theater. The girl behind me who commented (frequently) ""that didn't happen"" was somewhat annoying, but totally right. UGH, I'm SO tired of movies that could have easily been PERFECT but aren't."
629,8,A Step in the Right Direction,"Over the years, I've found that the Harry Potter films have been consistently competent, but they seem to repeat themselves with fairly redundant story lines. As I've often disclosed to my wife, the movies are comprised of one basic formula: there's a mystery at Hogwarts, and it's up to Mr. Potter and company to discover the truth and prevent any wrongdoing."
630,10,"Astonishing, terrific, multi-layered, excellent, satisfying...",The sixth instalment of the long-running Harry Potter series based on J.K.Rowling's series of novels is a remarkable achievement from director David Yates and joins its predecessor Order of the Phoenix as the franchise's two best releases. 
631,3,Six Hour Snooze Fest!!,"OK the movie was only 2½ hours long but this felt like six. The book must have been much better. I have seen all the Harry Potter movies but they have been declining over the years. Each one seems a bit more lack luster than the last. Half Blood Prince is not a good title, since the movie isn't about him. The movie is about love relationships of the students and who is snogging who. It is about time Harry Potter started having sex. After all the actor playing him is twenty. But really, children and adults will get bored watching this unless they are just die hard fans of Harry Potter. Interesting characters take a back seat in this movie, as the main plot seems fade away in the teen romance."
632,4,Only a wizard could answer this one....,"Some users have blamed David Yates for this bad movie. As the movie is part American I would say the one responsible for all the nonsense (apart from the producers of course) is the screenplay writer :Steve Kloves. This being said, this film seems to miss all the essential notions from the book. Although adapting a book is never easy, this film shows no effort at all has been made to bring the real story to the audience. If you do not know the story from the book, you may even sit there wondering what it's all about because there's hardly anything that's explained properly at all... The only true nice scene is the one from the quidditch game... well choreographed. The rest is a total waste. How are they going to explain away all the inconsistencies they've created when the next film comes, this is truly a question only a wizard could answer !"
633,9,The darkest of all Harry Potter films,"Half Blood Prince is the darkest of all Harry Potter films - quite literally. The grading effect applied to almost every single shot give the film an almost sepia tone, making the film look like the sets were illuminated solely by candles. However, given that this sixth instalment of the franchise is the most emotionally painful to go through, it works."
634,4,This is an opinion,"The movie should have stayed true to the book wherein the first scene started with the Muggle Prime Minister being introduced to the new Minister of Magic and while he was being told about the ministry and how resent catastrophe were magic related....scenes o death eaters destroying the bridge, etc should have been background scene and not, not what was shown in the movie."
635,7,The awakening of the chosen ones,This movie left me pleased in general. I will not try to grade it in comparison with the other Potter movies but I have to note certain aspects that make it distinct. The most obvious one is its comparatively overt portrayal of the adolescent awakening of the attraction to the opposite sex. The fact that the main characters are more that just friends becomes more than evident for the fist time. I have not read the book in order to be able to say whether that is the choice of the director or the accurate reproduction of the novelistic text but either way it is a departure from the past.
636,8,The Weakest So Far. Still Great Though.,"When I was younger, this was always my least favourite of the films, and I think I was being really harsh cause I enjoyed it a damn lot this time. Now I still think there is too much focus on the romantic aspect, and there are still a few small moments (Snape never explaining why he is the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore apparating in Hogwarts, some choppy action editing) do still annoy me, but there is a lot to love here. Slughorn is a great addition, and we get some much needed backstory for Voldemort. The Dumbledore/Harry stuff is the best its ever been, the Draco Malfoy parts are really good, and this might be the flat-out-funniest of the series. The visuals are also really good here, and it's great to see how they have changed over the series to match the tone. I feel like I haven't mentioned how good the cast are in a while - Michael Gambon and Alan Rickman in particular are both phenomenal here, and the original cast who were once kids and, frankly, not that good, have much improved over the years. Overall, this still isn't my favourite, but I think I was way too harsh to a genuinely great film."
637,9,A worthy addition to the Harry Potter saga,"I am glad to say that, in this writer's opinion, the Half-Blood Prince has restored the films to what they should have been since the Prisoner of Azkaban, three movies ago. The Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix, respectively, were characterised by too short a length, bland dialogue and the lack of vital subplots."
638,5,My lowest rating for an HP film,"***Spoilers*** I had so many high hopes for this film. I loved movies 1-5, but I did stop reading during the 4th book. I always felt that the HP movies did the books great justice- probably the best book-to-movie adaptations so far. But this one was awful. Yes I do understand that the movies will never be as good as the book/the movies will always leave something out. But I never thought I'd give an HP film any lower than a 7/10. I gave this one a five."
639,3,The worst Potter movie EVER !!!,"I read pretty much comments here and most of them found the sixth installment of Harry Potter for ""beautiful"", ""dark"", ""mature"", ""great adventure"", etc."
640,7,The best in the series so far - the last half-hour in particular is incredible,"A fact too many filmmakers and producers tend to forget lately is that the single most important element of making a successful film is a compelling plot and characters. While the previous entry in the series, the fifth, perhaps suffered from too much plot and characters, this latest installment, with its substantially longer running time, reaches a very satisfying balance. Sure, many sub-plots and entire sequences are lost in the adaptation, but this is an understandable and natural event, and necessary to condense the plot and keep things moving along. But more importantly, the filmmakers and screenwriter Steve Kloves know where to keep the focus for most of the duration of the film: its characters. At least in its first couple of hours, the film is essentially a character study, building up the relationships, feelings, thoughts and emotions of its three (already-not-so-young) protagonists – Harry, Ron and Hermione – while also devoting substantial time to develop and explore the emotional conflicts of a fourth character who was always so flat throughout the first five films but finally fulfills and even surpasses his potential this time around – Draco Malfoy. I was overjoyed that the film took the time out to develop his character and portray his emotions and conflicts, and it added an extra compelling element to an already very rich film."
641,5,Not a good adaptation,"I have never had any problems accepting detours and storyline changes in novel adaptations when I can clearly see the point. The Half Blood Prince, however, seems to suffer from not deviating enough from the novels storytelling to work properly as a movie. Rather than being a whole and solid story which could in theory exist and stand on it's own as if the book had never been written, the movie felt to me like a chain of key events from the book vaguely linked together. I felt like too much attention was put into preserving the original story and keeping die hard fans as happy as possible, all at the expense of the story falling apart on the screen."
642,7,worst movie of harry potter but,Worst movie of harry potter but is a good movie. David Yates is a very bad director. bad adaption
643,2,Uhhhhhh........what happened?,"Okay, I just purchased the DVD, Widescreen edition, and watched it on my 52"" flat-panel........and I have absolutely no idea what happened in this version of the novel. I turned all the lights off (had to), watched on the big-screen, and still could not see more than 50% of the movie. Why do directors think that the only way to impart mystery and drama is to turn out all the lights on the set? Honest, most of the movie was lost due to the utter absence of lighting of the scenes. Is it too much to ask that the viewer actually be able to SEE the movie? "
644,10,Um,"Luna lovegood is the backbone of the series, an underused and unapriciated character"
645,1,You're kidding right? Worst 1 yet.,"This was supposed to be the movie of all Harry Potter movies before the finale. Instead, they chose to completely leave behind every detail of the book and turn it into Twilight for Potter fans. What a disappointment."
646,8,Might not be as good as the book but it's still awesome!,"Harry Potter returns for his sixth year at Hogwarts along with his best friends Ron and Hermione. This year, a new Potions Master, Professor Slughorn, teaches at Hogwarts. When Harry goes to one of Slughorn's classes, he finds an old battered Potions textbook with scribbles all over it which, in the end, turns out useful to him. This book belongs to, drumroll please, the Half-Blood Prince. While Harry is fixated with the book, he must find out who the Half-Blood Prince is. The Half-Blood Prince has been much anticipated since November (it's real release date before it was cancelled for July). So Harry Potter fans, like me, have been waiting for eight months for the release of this movie, watching the brilliant trailers, hoping the movie was going to be the same quality. Ladies and Gentlemen, I can tell you that the movie is just brilliant."
647,9,As good as any other HP film,"The year that Harry Potter becomes a nerd. At this point, I had grown up enough to recognise the mastery of Alan Rickman's acting - not gonna lie, it made me appreciate Snape a lot better. Plot-wise, it's the beginning of the end and this film brings answers that give the audience all they need to know to sit back and enjoy the last film."
648,7,Alright..,"I used to think this movie was boring, but it did a great joke of displaying the lives of the students at Hogwarts without all the drama. I'm a bit disappointed about how colorless it was but it did fit the theme of the movie. Another peeve of mine is how they seriously messed up Ginny's character and many others. Some of the dialog was cringe, in my opinion this is the worst Harry Potter film. They could've done much better displaying Ginny and Harry's romance and how they grew to love each other."
649,6,Not the best in the series,"Im a huge fan of Harry Potter. I love the books and the films. The 6th is my second favourite out of the books, the 7th is my favourite. I went to see this yesterday and was really looking forward to it. I liked it but not as much as I hoped."
650,7,"flawed interpretation gets away with murdering the original material, but does get away with it",Harry Potter is back at Hogwart's and Dumbledore has a particular task for the young wizard.
651,,harry potter in a half dead movie,"This movie in my opinion is the worst of all the HP movies. The names are the same. Most of the scenes are LOOSELY based on the book. Best Done character? Snape Worst sequence? Fight as the bad guys are running away, lacked depth and any real action. Harry is portrayed as such a wuss. With computer animation any part of the book should have been easily doable. The valiant fight in the school against the death-eaters?? missing in action!!! If I were JKR I would sue somebody over this horrid piece. The Movie was Dark and seemed to be JKR's nightmare of what the series should not be. "
652,6,Harry Potter and the Missing Plot,"Okay I'll try not to be too harsh because I did enjoy the movie. I enjoyed it because it was entertaining, funny and not boring. And I liked the special effects and the acting was also good. "
653,7,"Half-Blood Prince Brings a More Mature Tone to the Franchise, Despite Pacing Issues and Underdeveloped Characters","""Half-Blood Prince"" marks a shift in tone for the Harry Potter franchise, as the stakes become higher and the characters are forced to confront the reality of a world at war. This sixth installment is a strong entry in the series, despite some pacing issues and a lack of focus on certain storylines."
654,6,weak in a lot of aspects,"What a waste. The great book was wasted by very bad screenplay and worse directing. Honestly, did actually someone force David Yates to direct this movie? I don't know where to start. I read all Harry Potter books and watched the movies so far but I am not really a fan boy, I just enjoy. So my comments are rather objective."
655,2,Bo-ring,"My favorite review about this movie: ""It's boring, nothing happens, and Dumbledore dies in the end."" Pretty much wraps it up."
656,,Big Disappointment,"This is by far the worst entry in the series so far, I'm sorry to say. There is no zest to the film. And as others have mentioned, many important story elements in the book have been left out. Why leave out the opening scene with the muggle PM meeting the Minister of Magic? That would have been an excellent summary for new viewers. With a little persuasion they might have got Tony Blair to play the PM: that would have been a hoot. "
657,8,The best HP movie yet,"I've read all the books and loved them. What I find really annoying is that the same people that whined about PoA, Gof and OotP not being canon enough, go to see HBP and suddenly are shocked and outraged the movie doesn't follow canon. Obviously these people have a learning disability."
658,7,Great film....but doesn't give you the closure that you find in the other films,"This is coming from someone who has just watched all 5 movies for the first time a week before this film came out. Its pretty easy to peg this one. If you enjoy the others, you will easily enjoy this one. It certainly travels further down the 'darker' potter path, especially with its incredible score and fantastic cinematography that just pull you into the story even more. The movie is very well rounded.....it has just the right touch of every aspect......by having just enough action, just enough humor, and just enough suspense. One cannot help but be entertained by its story. However, the only mis-understanding i had with the film was the end. They really didn't give you much closure that you would find in the other films. Even if something bad happened at the end.....they would always find a way to end it with the audience feeling complete.....and that is something that i admired about the Harry Potter series. But this movie didn't have that edge to it. For the first time, it left you wanting more. Now is that a bad thing.....not at all......it was just different, and it took some time for you to grasp the concept. Sure we have had our Empire Strikes Back, where we leave the theatre saying ""I cannot believe that, whats going to happen to so-and-so"". If you have not read the books, and only seen the movies like i have.....you will certainly see that added effect to the end. But does it take away from the movies overall value......not at all......it has easily saved the 2009 summer....by actually providing some depth and entertainment with its story. Very well done."
659,9,Dark places,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters."
660,6,Harry Potter and the half-blood prince,Like all Harry Potter fans I have read all of the books and seen every film so far. I would have to say that this film is not my favourite so far and leaves you feeling that some vital parts of the book are missing. However this is worth watching and I feel this will only disappoint the most hardcore Harry fans!
661,10,Absolutely Perfect,"Definitely one of my favourite movies of the series. Not many movies can make me cry, but the ending really got me."
662,10,Definitely my favourite,"Love it so much probably, because it's so different from the rest. We get to see how dark the world is now that the Dark Lord is out there and not even hiding it. Draco's dark side taking over, Snape teaching defence against dark arts, Ron is in love for a while and gets a girlfriend, Hermione is finally open to Harry about his feelings towards their mutual friend. Not to mention Dumbledore's death, which was very emotional to me."
663,8,Another Harry Potter another slightly better movie!,"Starring again is this new Harry Potter is Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson of coarse are the main characters and along with the others. In this movie Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is trying to figure out who the half blood prince is when he discovers an old school book with more intelligent ways of perfecting the spells written in a potions book. After watching or reading the sixth book in the seventh movie and book everything has been unsafe to everyone because the return of Voldemort is now known, including going back to Hogwarts. Along with that Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has shown him past memories of Tom Riddle who is now Lord Voldemort and telling him he is keeping himself alive through horcruxes which they will have to find and destroy in order to kill Voldemort. This movie was so well done and it's been so much fun watching all of the main characters grow up since the first movie and they have all done such a great job I don't think I would have picked any other kids besides them to do all these movies."
664,7,"i give seven points to some nice plot moments and to a few actors, who were brilliant.","10 points for Snape, was well done, but since he is the half-blood prince, we should of seen him more in the movie. Hermione was brilliant, Ron brilliant, Ginny - just beautiful, Harry Potter - just horrible. He didn't persuade me of his feelings to Ginny, and they should be very strong. Perhaps that gentle kiss and the way Ginny took his hand compensated it a little. I honestly don't like Daniel anymore in playing the most important role, he is not doing it well for me. Everyone around him is doing it much better. He wasn't even jealous when Ginny kissed another guy."
665,4,Meh,"More teenage dating drama than cool wizard stuff. Seems toothless. The acting and music aren't bad, but the whole thing feels uninspired. Has a few interesting moments, some laughs. Overrated."
666,7,"Leaving the Book Aside, the Best Potter Movie Yet","Since midnight on July 15 it has been clear that people around that world have been eagerly awaiting an update in the Harry Potter saga. The fact that nearly everyone in the theater already knows what is about to happen doesn't seem to matter much. The movie pulled in the largest ever midnight showing box-office revenues and smashed through the opening weekend coming out, unsurprisingly, on top. Little if any of this was unsuspected. What was unsuspected was the vast difference between critical reviews and Potter fan reviews. The critics loved the film and Rowling book lovers, in large part, were not impressed. The problem, I think, lies in the fact that avid Potter readers walk into the theater and expect to see every plot point covered in the 652 page book portrayed on screen—in less than two and a half hours. It's simply not possible."
667,2,Royal Flushed...,"Year 6. Harry is nearing the end of his summer of reflection. After agreeing to host a tube hostess for the evening , another reflection appears across the track. Dumbledore. He has somewhere to be and so does Harry."
668,5,"It looks great, but it's not that good","It's been almost 8 years since the first film of the Harry Potter saga came out. The cast has grown as did the budget and the buzz surrounding it. In these 8 years, technology has developed too and that is pretty noticeable. It's going be surprising if ""The Half-Blood Prince"" doesn't get a few award nominations on the visual and special effects area. It may be daring to claim, but I didn't see one single mistake or bad effect (except maybe the absence of Harry's scar in a few scenes, but the guy probably didn't have that much time to spend in the make-up chair)."
669,8,Strange and romantic love,"How did he grow up to be a gloomy, proud and humble teenager, how did he meet Lily Evans, who was still a girl, and fell in love with her, and how did he love her, and loved her all his life?<br /><br />This love. To the extent of aesthetic feeling. What's the big deal if you just cling to your life and persevere in it. This kind of love with dreams and delusion sinks into the sea of illusion, which makes people secretly lose heart. I sighed silently. The practitioners of this kind of love are terribly tough inside. Not even time matters."
670,3,This is BAD,"I have never read the books. But i did watch all the 5 previous movies. They were enjoyable to good (Goblet of Fire). But this was well actually nothing. This is a totally empty movie. No story, no action, misplaced ""humour"" After 10 minutes i wondered when is this movie going to start. After 2 hours it was enough and i left the cinema. 2 1/2 hours of love potion making and scenes that make you fall asleep (i dozed off 4 times) Why is Harry just looking like a coward when they kill Dumbledore. After that he follows them???"
671,8,Little better than the last.,"The 6th installment in the Harry Potter franchise, it's good. It's better than the last but not better than any of the others. I really liked Draco's involvement in this movie I also liked the mystery of the Half Blood Prince. The plot wasn't too bad, but I didn't like how it involves romance so much."
672,4,Why do we do it to ourselves?,"It comes around most summers, the flurry of hype and advertising surrounding the latest Harry Potter instalment, and every critic claims it is The Best One Yet, the reviews all say Harry Potter Shows Its Dark Side and everyone comments on how they are Maturing As Actors."
673,4,Totally disappointed with the ending.,"---Spoiler Alert--- I do not read HP books, but I interestingly follow every movie. I have been enthralled with HP movies before, and this movie started off beautifully - darker than ever, and the special effects were rendered very well. I was ready to watch the best ending ever. I was expecting an extraordinary war or battle. All I got was disappointment."
674,8,Maybe my favourite Harry Potter,"It's quite complex and often funny. It looks great, and manages to bring out many emotions at once, with characters often going their separate ways against each other."
675,1,the worst potter film till now,"what a freaking' awful thing...all the greatest most important matters from the book where missing. all the fantastic scenes, the excitement, the mystery....who's responsible for this awful crap?"
676,8,Don't know why People Hating it,Guys it only Movie it s hard to Take Book into Cemenatic world so enjoy the movement and Don't Compare it With Book Movie gets u emotional and Happy at same time and Leaves many Questions Behind for Next One it's like Once u got U want More .
677,8,Brilliant,"There are a lot of things I would like to press in this review, but I'll try to keep it to a bare minimum. First off I knew that from the beginning that the tone of the film would be more darker and serious. And I loved that, as most of the previous films hadn't captured that. Yates brings his skills to the screen directly, and with Kloves writing, everything worked out great. The acting seemed more solid, a credit to Yates and I would like to name a few who I believed were tremendous, Felton as Malfoy, Radcliffe as Harry, Gambon was much much better, Rickman was superb and Broadbent pulled off an excellent Slughorn. The visuals were excellent, particularly the cave scene where Dumbledore casts the fire. And most importantly, it was very close to the book. Although It would have been better if more scenes closer to the plot were added, such as the battle at Hogwarts, but reading about why it was cut, I felt it was a good enough reason. So all in all, I was still happy with the end result. The score really did bring out the emotion in the film, particularly at the end. I believe that it was the combination of Kloves's writing combined with Yates directing, as the previous HP film had a different writer, and there was a different atmosphere. Overall, a great film that stuck close to the book and will very likely thrill the audience."
678,8,A technical standout,"This might well be the most underrated of all the movies. One's first impression upon viewing is usually that 'nothing happens' until the end. However, repeated viewings reveal a deep tapestry of emotions and genres, ranging from romantic comedy to murder mystery."
679,4,A cure for Insomnia,I was surprised to see how far these films had fallen. I absolutely could not stay awake through it. I tried rewinding several times to regain interest and finally gave up.
680,10,Amazingly brilliant.....Worth waiting the whole year for!!,"OK...i know everyone's gonna start having hissy-fits about the rating I gave, But come on....Im a die-hard potter-fanatic and after a whole year of excruciatingly painful wait (I actually kept crossing days off the calender *gulp*) I was more than satisfied!! This movie beats every other summer movie that was released including the not-so-watchable Transformers sequel and a mildly funny Ice-Age 3(saving grace....of course scrat and scratte!!) :/ To start of with, the visuals are as usual mind-blowing and very well-placed...Unlike some movies (*cough* transformers *cough*), it doesn't over-kill with the CGI. The music composed by Nic Hooper stands out and the Weasley Twins theme just gets stuck in your head!! The direction is quite brilliant considering the time constraints in making a movie outta 600-page odd-book, however its been nothing short of spectacular!The key points are well-set-up and unlike some comments i've read (*cough* guy from MN, USA *cough*), I totally rebuke them!! The stellar cast is nothing short of spectacular...and Tom Felton as the ""timid boy made to stand-in as a brave one"" steals the show. His expressions and words reek with the inner turmoil and anguish, Im hoping for his BAFTA nomination for outstanding performance in comparison to stalwarts like Jim broadbent, Alan Rickman and well...Michael Gambon (*cough*)."
681,9,The best movie yet!,"I see a lot of complaining about how this movie strayed to far from the books, and that's very true, but I still loved it. They took out a lot of things and inserted a lot of things too (the opening scene is awesome) and that was why this movie was able to positively surprise me even though I read the books."
682,2,Harry Potter meets Soap Opera,"Let me say first, i haven't read any books of the HP-Saga to this day(will do that when i saw the last installment of the films in 2011). Before watching the HBP I knew Dumbledore would die in it and yeah I already know Harry will beat Voldemort in Book 7, but after HBP i thought ""What the hell was that???"". The whole plot is totally out of balance. One unrelated scene after another combined with poor dialogs. The first 90 minutes are complete soap-opera. Horny teens are running through a pheromone-fogged Hogwarts. No development in the story, simply nothing to gather momentum. Complete boredom. At this time i noticed a few people leaving cinema(first time i watched that on a HP-Film!). It seems the director David Yates was over challenged. No sense for dramatic scenery, the right pace and the correct emphasis. When Dumbledore was killed by Snape. A 3-Minute-Scene, no funeral...nothing. As if Dumbledore was a supporting role. The disappointment was complete. And not forgetting Harry himself. Yates and/or the disastrous screenplay(should get a razzie next year for 'worst adapted screenplay') direct HP like a helpless coward. In every duel Harry's enemy do one magic spell and HP lies beaten on the ground. After the movie was over I thought ""So, this is the chosen one? This is the one who will kill Voldemort??"" After that episode not by himself!! Maybe Voldemort sees Harry and says:""Oh boy, you're such a loser. It's beneath my dignity to raise my magic wand. You win!"" Please Mr.Yates do us a favor and pass the directors-chair to somebody else. PLEASE!!!"
683,8,Certainly not Half-Full,"David Yates' second Potter adaption is a large improvement on his flawed but very entertaining and visually impressive first. With humour in abundance, violent action, a darkened mood to coincide with the predecessors in the franchise and an improved sense of characterisation anchor the 'Half Blood Prince' into higher regard than the 'Order of the Phoenix' (film wise)."
684,6,Harry Potter & the Love Potion Number 9,SPOILERS (not many or that big) AHEAD 
685,8,Suspenseful Installment,"Its the worst adaptation of the book so far as I have heard but as am just considering movie here, I liked it. Definitely better than earlier. Improved acts by everyone is a plus. With every installments its growing darker and darker and now we can actually feel the presence of Voldemort. It brings with itself more wizardry, more visual effects and a great cinematography. The romance is blooming now and a maturity is seen in characters. The movie created a mystery in the beginning itself and the suspense is carried out throughout till the end. Watch for the climax as its quite surprising. Overall I loved this one and would definitely recommend it."
686,9,"Not a bad film, perhaps the second best of the series","I wasn't expecting the movie to be good when I saw this film, mind you - I had no real expectations going in at all, beyond a kind of dread. The PG rating immediately turned me off, and I was pretty much going through the motions with it. The moment the film started i was utterly surprised at the dark, Gothic feel that was not nearly as prevalent in previous films."
687,6,Solid production that I'll never watch again,"The plot of ""Half Blood Prince"" could fit on a cocktail napkin. Harry returns to Hogwarts, does some more coming of age, and tries to avert an evil plot by the forces of darkness. Like the Potter films before it, the production is competent, but leaves me with no desire to ever see it again. Having read the books, the films feel like visual Cliffs Notes with the only surprise being how the cast and crew interpret the material."
688,10,"Great, But too many complaints!","The movie for me was great. It was funny, exciting, and included parts from the book. Sure it didn't include EVERYTHING, but it's a 2 hour movie. They can't fit everything into it. But some parts weren't in the book but were in the movie. For example: 1. Harry flirts with a girl."
689,4,My excitement about last 2 parts is 0/10,"The first part was surprisingly good and mature and above regular children movie. Second was a 2 steps down, but yet enjoyable and trapping. Third was a return to the form but the fourth was best, funny, adventurous, dark and Harry's best presentation as tortured hero."
690,10,Best by a mile,"Okay, so I saw this movie on opening night. I liked it, but it didn't fulfill all my expectations. Little action, much comedy, and staying very true to the book gave me mixed feelings. i didn't think it was my favorite. I saw it again because I thought I needed too, and let me just say, bravo. It has such a good story, a lot more action than I thought, and some very funny scenes. The cave scene was exactly how I imagined it. The only little problems I had were the flashbacks- they're weren't enough! I don't see how they can do some things with the 7th one without them, but who knows. The flashbacks that were done are brilliant, by the way. I just have to say, I'm craving a 3rd viewing and it reigns supreme on my list of Harry Potter movies now."
691,9,Why is everyone so furious? IT WAS GREAT.,"I cannot stay quiet while all you ""fans"" are putting bad things about the movie. You know what my family used to tell me after a Harry Potter film? My dad was like: it's OK. My brother literally slept. My mom didn't even get them. Now it was all different. They all told me it was great... and it was the premier. So tell me about it. They enjoyed not being in bed until 4 o'clock. That was when I realized that even thought they left many things aside (like DD's funeral, like the Dursleys, and the amazing fight we all missed) it was AWESOME. We all laughed and enjoyed the movie (especially me, who didn't sleep for 2 nights remembering every single part of it) because it wasn't exactly the book. Yes, what you'd read. We love to see an adaptation just like it is. But this was beyond everything we have imagined. Maybe that's the problem: perhaps we expected too much. But at the minute I started to forget the book (because books and movies are DIFFERENT) I realized it was freaking amazing. Dialogues were great, the course of the story was enjoyable (not tiring) and there were so many clues that really satisfied what we didn't have. Perhaps the only thing I didn't like too much was the ending because it was confusing (like Hermione telling Harry Ron was OK with his relationship with Ginny when there was only a kiss and some flirt), but keeping that aside, it was one of the best movies of the series. Really. I'll be one of those ""freaks"" with Hogwarts robes when the DVD (or should I say Blu-Ray?) comes out. So what are you all waiting reading this? GO SEE HARRY POTTER!"
692,9,Underrated,I don't know why so many people hate this film. I think it's pretty good!
693,8,Unique Yet Still Good,"Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying"
694,2,The POINT please?,Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince.
695,9,"Memorable Broadbent, fine Gambon, superbly crafted film with bleak ending",This is a superbly crafted film and I raised my rating to 10 after a second viewing.
696,9,"Emotionally Stimulating, Dark, Hilarious...AMAZING!","Being a huge fan of the books, I tend to be a critic when it comes to weighing out the book and the film. I have noticed with the Harry Potter series as the books get bigger, the films generally get worse excluding The Goblet of Fire."
697,10,Mixed emotion,"All in one, happy, funny, and sad. From the love that star to bloom to the dark secrets that revealed. The story becomes more exiting"
698,2,absurdly awful considering how great the book it is adapted from was!,"Y'know, I loved most of the Harry Potter book-to-movie adaptations. It's such an amazing world to get to spend time in, I felt privileged that the movies offered me an excuse to retread previous territory in the books. I enjoyed seeing certain details as if for the first time while watching all of my favorite scenes-the most poignant ones--still present in the movies."
699,9,"Very dark, but very good","This film is easiky the darkest of all eight, however with some spectacular scenes all the way through, it becomes very memorable. Emotion plays a huge part to this film, which really lifts it up close to the top."
700,8,The Movie vs The Book,"In Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince our heroes (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) are portrayed as lovesick teenagers with more serious things to worry about. Again the enemy (the dark Lord Voldemort) has a mole inside the Hogwarts school of magic. One of the people that Albus Dumbledore trusts most makes a secret pact with the enemy to protect this mole."
701,8,one of the most stylish potter films,"Many people will comment on the large chunks of the novel the film has missed out, however most people do not go to see a Harry Potter film purely for the story (if you only like the story of Harry Potter then just read the books as it is impossible to successfully tell the story in 150mins). People go to see the directors vision of that story. And in this sense the 6th Harry Potter film is truly successful. David Yates creates a visual style that shows his unique vision of Harry Potter and makes a film that truly stands out from the rest in the series. This style can clearly be seen in the flashbacks that are some of the best bits of the film where an inky blackness is used and where Tom Riddles voice always echoes slightly. If you liked Alfonso Cuaron vision of Prizoner Of Azkaban then I highly recommend this film."
702,9,"When I told my 5 years old niece that Harry Potter is just a story, she started crying.","I'm not really willing to give much details- rhymes & reasons regarding this film, because I know that those who have seen the previous five will go for this one just the same. My only little emphasis here: Do Watch It. "
703,9,great!,"This movie is so emotionally heavy and at times so funny. Like all the other harry potter movies, it's also so funny in the start and then the never ending loop of reveals start. The ending was so emotional for me. Fawkes was leaving, the trio was never coming back to hogwarts and dumbledore was dead. There was so much that was killing me inside."
704,4,What is with all the good ratings?,"This movie is crap! Everyone on this world who read the novel will confirm that... or they are completely nuts! Well... for the sake of truth i have to admit that i thought ""oh this is a good movie"" until the so called showdown starts. No Action at all! The book was full of it! Lots of fights and deaths and rel great action... NON in the movie! Just the death of Dumbledore! To me it seems like this movie builds up on the death of him! It centers about presenting Dumbledore once more as a great man everyone have to love and ... boom he dies! Im not saying he should have lived, no way! What i am saying is that some little... no,much more, more action would have been just good. My other concern is that you don't know how the Harry/Ginny and Hermione/ Ron relationships ended of if you did not read the book. Too much of a Teenie Movie as well! It focuses way too much on stupid Teenager Relationships... and this is NOT mature at all! All the jokes too are very stupid! It is much more of a kids film (with love) as any other part was if you ask me. But for the sake of the book: watch this movie to find it awful! That is all i ask of you. "
705,1,A slap in the face for Harry Potter fans,"There are many ways in which the story in the movie differs from the one in the book. One could conclude with certainty that everything in the book that contributes to the depth of the characters, thus the plot, making it convincing, is in the movie subordinated to the needs of commerce, meaning; action scenes (the notorious added scene, which was a truly ""how dare you"" move, according to book fans), clichés, ""let's-go-see-twilight"" type of crowd pleasers... The building of the story is completely destroyed, leaving only the scenes that were described as epic in the book, without awareness that the journey to these events, the details, and the getting to know the characters, played the most important role in the epic effect that it had on the readers. I understand that movie adaptations quite often require changes in plot and detail, so the story could be told right. This movie is, however, changing the story into something it is not; a shallow, boring, wannabe epic, that attracts mostly teenagers that desperately want to fit in. If Terry Gilliam had been given a chance to direct this, maybe it would have worked, but this guy turned a great story into a bad film, trying to make it ""better"". A slap in the face for Harry Potter fans."
706,7,Weakest Harry Potter adaptation to date,"I should note that I stopped reading the Harry Potter books after the 3rd one, because as they started growing in thickness I had other reading to do in my library and preferred to finish the series when the series was finished. So as I watched the movie adaptations starting with Globlet of Fire they were fresh. That strategy did not work at all with this movie. It was about as exciting as watching a chess match without knowing all rules of the game. It is clear they are lopping out large portions of the books in order to tell a 2-hour story and this one did not translate to film very well."
707,10,Excellent!,"Nobody cares what you think. This is an awesome movie that I went to see over and over again! If you are so disappointed, go see the horrible Bay-formers and STFU. This is the best film of the summer and I guess that you don't understand how they translate an almost 652 pages book into a 2.5 hours of a brilliant film. Do you think you can make it better ? You think you have what it takes to make a harry potter film ? Well I don't know who you are, but something tells me that you can't! You are just a whiny fan boy who wants to hate everything they make. There were certain parts that I also wished they would include from the book, but they didn't and it was yet the second best Hp film. The best one so far was ""The order of the Phoenix"". Besides nobody cares what people in India think. "
708,10,Like a great wine this only gets better,"I have re-watched the Harry Potter films a few times and it is this film which captures me more and more. It really is an outstanding film. The direction is utterly brilliant, the music incredibly haunting (especially with Draco at the cabinet), the love lost themes heartfelt, the torn character of Draco superb, the acting by Daniel R at new heights, and the performance of Jim Broadbent almost show-stealing."
709,7,Made as good as possible,Once I read the book where this film was based on I knew immediately that this movie has so much potential to be great. There is so much in this story so I was really excited. David Yates is a director who is really experienced with the more political themes and Love themes. Mostly TV productions. It was an interesting choice to ask him back because he did a good job on 5 and I was sure he could do this.
710,1,Feeling ripped off? oh yeah,"Do you feel ripped off after watching this movie? Yeah, me too... The only thing that REALLY happened was that the old bloke with the long white beard spread himself on the fine Hogwarts cobblestone. There were two and a half excruciating hours of ... well... nothing ... except a lot of CGI, quite useless, if you ask me. Maybe I'm not a true fan of Harry Potter, but if i were, I would have really felt disappointed after watching this. I felt like the producers went hand in hand with the popcorn sellers .In the cinema i went there was a pee/popcorn brake. The pee brake was the most rewarding sequence of the whole movie, which could have been summarized in one hour tops. I can hardly wait for Harry Potter blah blah blah 2... NOT. Enjoy this movie, if you can. I couldn't"
711,7,Surprisingly Good,Other Potter reviews
712,9,The best Potter yet,"Book purists beware: if you expect every scene in the book to be covered here, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a fun, well-crafted, well-acted, exciting adaptation that captures the essence of the book, you'll be satisfied."
713,1,David Yates is a jerk,"I want to ask David Yates personally about this: ""Do you hate HP books? or ""Do have a personal hate to JK Rowling?"" If not.. Why do u intend to make HP movie become worse and worse?? I had enough disappointment with the fifth movie. But compared to the last one, the fifth one is like The Sound of Music with many Grammies. PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASEEEEEEEE don't make the 7th movie.. I don't think is the actors and actress that make the movie so bad.. It's the writer and the director who has changed so many important part in the movie... Harry looks like a coward when he just stood there watching Dumbledore died.. and after that, he started calling Snape a coward... Oh.. come on... I will stop hating you if you step up and be a gentleman and admit that you are just not good enough to direct the movie.. Please give it to some one else who are more competent... PLEASEEEE"
714,8,Polished Film that somehow lacks a certain Gusto,"The film is arguably one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all-time, especially seeing it's the first Potter flick that has been released since 2007. After watching the movie, I cannot pin-point as to why this great film lacked a certain ingredient that could've made it a classic."
715,1,This is called a bridge...,"...but frankly I rather would like to see this bridge torn down for remodeling purposes. How to fill up a 2h+ movie with absolutely nothing beats me. I definitely liked the other Harry Potter movies and will find the time to see them again... eventually. Halfway through the movie I waited it to end. But this was a complete and utter waste of time. Yes, it follows the book to a point but did it have to be a 2h+ movie for that. This was the first Harry Potter movie that made me yawn and go to the toilet. I was away for 10 min and missed absolutely nothing important. Save your money and rent it instead. If you MUST see it. Otherwise, see something better then this like for instance a B-movie."
716,7,It's mostly just a bridge towards the final film.,"The 6th installment of the Harry Potter film reminded me a lot like its previous movie, except that this story heavily focuses on the background of Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) and the sexual tension that our three main characters are experiencing in their mid-adolescence."
717,7,Fogive it,"""Harry Potter"" like a classical Chinese novel ""Journey to the West,"" he said in his imagination the sky is attracting hundreds of millions of readers. However, the wonderful novel lies in its ability to stimulate readers to text ""translation"" into the image, as to the quality of finish you made from your own dishes, and the silver screen version of the slightest mistake would be like a factory produced canned or box. Look at ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", I suddenly have a mind of such a thought: Since when large is no longer so excited and we look forward to it? ""Transformers 2"" failed to achieve the expected positive, wish I could get to see a large number of pleasure, but out of theater, I still can not help but be disappointed, perhaps, that is, there is a large free word-of-mouth box office era. "
718,3,Slow and Dull. Richard Curtis Lite,"This film was so slow it almost stopped. The plot took an age to get going and was OK thereafter, but not until near the end."
719,5,Half-Blood prince=Half-A@# Movie fare!,I want to start by saying half a movie deserves half a score (hence the 5). I took my 10 year old son to this film. So I have the opinion of two adverse perspectives. From the opening scene I was in high hopes that this installment of the Potter franchise might actually be entertaining to those not involved in the page-turning melodrama. I was sadly mistaken.
720,9,Easily the best of the series,"Up till this point, I was always vaguely dissatisfied with the Harry Potter films, feeling that they failed to adequately represent the source material. They either cut out important bits, left in unimportant bits or were just badly paced or filled with mawkish sentiment. The directors chosen to helm previous instalments were a mixed bag. Alfonso Cuaron's darkly Gothic ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was, till now, the best of the bunch, mixing a brilliant cinematic sensibility with great storytelling, while the others were a mixed back. Mike Newell's ""Goblet of Fire"" was very slick, but also very soulless, a SFX buffet sans wit, while Chris Columbus first two films are nigh on unwatchable, full of terrible dialogue and mawkish, cheesy sentimentality."
721,9,"Dark, Gritty and Atmospheric","I've seen a lot of criticism towards the producers for straying somewhat from the source material in Half-Blood Prince. So far the big screen adaptations have rarely included any scene or other that is not explicitly stated in the works of JK Rowling. I can see why a lot of hardcore fans of the books are disappointed in some of the decisions to deviate from the origin - I too am one of those fans - but to be wholly honest the movie is all the better for such scenes. The much maligned Burrow attack scene seems to have caused the most tears throughout reviews. I believe Yates and co. took the initiative to include this act as a device to shoehorn Bellatrix somewhere onto the screen, and as far as I'm concerned the more we see of Helena Bonham Carter in this role the better. So overall I am not critical at all of the producers' decisions to stray from the books, and thought a defence of these judgements was in order."
722,5,Magic for fans but won't convert non-believers!,HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE Director: Peter Yates Country: USA/UK Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 153 Minutes Rating: 12(A)
723,2,Worst of the lot!!!,"This movie was terrible. I expected something much better from all the wonderful critics who must have been paid to create their praise of this film. I should have realized something was wrong when on opening day there were 12 showings of this film at my theater and the next day the showings were cut by half. Let's get to the movie itself. The book is huge and it looks like the director took enough scenes from the book to put together this snoozer. Unfortunately, the parts he took at times make no sense whatsoever without an explanation or reading the book. There was a sense to the movie that you should read the book first to understand what is going on in the movie. Even having seen all the previous Harry Potter movies does not help you to understand what is going on. Scenes begin and then they end without anything being accomplished. As for the plot it is fairly simple once you determine what it is but to get there you must plod along with a movie almost totally bereft of any action. And just to put a cherry on top at the very end the half-blood prince is revealed. Wow, this revelation has all the effect of a balloon slowly losing air. You will be saying to yourself, now what does this have to do with the plot? My suggestion? Read the book if you actually want to waste your money on this 2 hour mess."
724,4,Lack of important details - so bored I fell asleep,"Harry Potter's series were my daughter's favorite. We have them on DVD and she watched them a lot, over and over again. I too accompany her and even read all the books."
725,9,A must watch for fans and not so much the fans of Harry Potter,"The first thing I said to my friend after leaving the Theatre was that after the Sorcerer's Stone, this was the perfect adaptation of a Harry Potter book. The direction was awesome and it captured and accentuated the key plot points. The cinematography was superb. Throughout the movie various color schemes have been used - right from vivid sunny colors to obscure tints of reds and blues - all these create just the perfect ambiance."
726,9,"I loved it, despite the flaws.","First of all, I am a MASSIVE Harry Potter fan, but that doesn't mean I'm saying the following just because I love the series so much."
727,8,The beginning of the end,As the progression continues deeper within and throughout the sequel. The main principle and point of view. As back in the beginning and the basics. Has been told as we known it. As the main foundation as between. Ones again decided the final three movies reminding in Hp.
728,1,Utter Garbage,"i cannot believe that this trash was shown to me last night i waited hours to see this and after the disappointment of all the other movies i thought WB would have gotten it together and made this movie for the true Harry Potter Fans the ones that read and love the books not the lazy ones who just watch the movies this movie had no imagination, the one main thing i was looking forward to was the big fight seen in the castle... and the ""liquid Luck"" they made Harry seem stoned out of his freaking tree what the hell is with that you show ""durg use"" but no fighting? come on! what they need is a true harry potter fan to re-direct all of these movies i think the only one that was closest to the book was the first movie. all of these movies have so much to offer a true Harry Potter fan would sit through a 6-9 hour movie if they knew it was going to be true to the book and thats what they should have done made each movie a 2 parter just shameful work anyways another thing i didn't like was how they foreshadowed EVERYTHING! i can't believe they would do that how are you suppose to enjoy something when its utter BS (and this is for the lazy people who don't want to read the books) how can you get the one piece of the film where you use your imagination to think of what could be going on??? and i wasn't expecting WWW scene to be so short they were in their shop for like what a whole 4-5mins come on..."
729,9,Finally! A movie with some fiber :),Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince...
730,9,"Look at it as a movie, not a book","I realize that this movie, although it does follow the basic plot of the book, is completely different from it, but it is still incredibly entertaining and well-done. There are so many things that stand out in this movie, from the brilliant acting, to the masterful and toned cinematography, to the haunting, magical soundtrack, and the competent direction. Everyone seem definitely gave it their all on this movie, and it shows."
731,1,Worst Movie Ever!,"WORST MOVIE EVER! Why don't the directors start writing novels of their own, because it's evident that they cannot follow the ones Rowling has written. She should be appalled by the way they have completely disfigured her stories. I would. And I thought that the Order of the Phoenix film was bad!... This is much worse."
732,10,I cried. And I don't cry THAT often.,"I went to see the premier with some of my friends and my little brother at 12:01 am, July 15th. "
733,4,Cant understand all the praise that this one got.,"I can remember seeing this at a cinema while on holiday with my family in Great Yarmouth. I highly anticipated seeing as it had been two years since the last one. I grew up with the books and movies, and always got a fantastic experience and sense of adventure when I watched them. But Potter's 6th adventure is the worst of the series, considering that the book was pretty cool. I walked out of that cinema wishing that i'd spent my money on mundane arcade machines."
734,,I have seen the worst Potter's film,"The harry potter and the half-blood prince was the worst film,the past films are far better than this film,this film had no action or fighting.It isn't the same as J.K.Rowling's writing.I studied this book rather than seeing the film .It has no important opera.The lead character of the film is Potter,maybe he is older .haha... Too many things were cut out, too little action, too much fluff, and, at the end, I didn't care whether or not there was a DD funeral. Definitely the weakest film yet, too many things taken out, and too many silly things put back in this film .lastly, when I finished seeing this film,I felt very disappointed.it has a good writer and a perfect star ,but it has not a good director."
735,7,"""You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter""","This my second time watching through the Harry Potter movies. And upon rewatch this was a lot better than I remember.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in most of the Harry Potter movies is that they are too long. I believe if they shaved off 30 minutes of most of the movies they would be better.<br /><br />Like all the Harry Potter movies the 3 main cast members are compelling and there interactions with other characters such as Dumboldor and Snape.<br /><br />As the movies go along they get darker, and less humorous, but the humor in the movie lands.<br /><br />Specifically this movie starting with the ending sets up the two part final chapter very well.<br /><br />Dumboldor's death is very tragic and very surprising the first time, not for me I either had it spoiled or was asleep.<br /><br />The relationship between Hemonie and Ron is at its strongest in this movie. Draco starts down largest part of his arc, when before he was a constant side character with little change.<br /><br />Ginny and Harry are not portrayed as a good couple, according to my brother not done justice to the books.<br /><br />I appreciate learning more about Voldemort and building up his master plan for the nexts movie, though it may not be strongest.<br /><br />Though the most memorable part is when 100s of gollums attack Harry as they crawl out of a lake, them Dumboldore shoots fire."
736,5,An epic series deserves an epic movie.,I was looking forward to this. I do not read the books so i was expecting some gaps in the narrative (especially after Azkaban).
737,5,Did not live up to the hype,"I walked into the movie theater for this movie expecting a very good movie for a lot of reasons. One was the hype, it was one of the most looked forward to movies of the year. Another reason was the book, which was good and also seemed to be perfect to be turned into a movie. However, I left the theater a very disappointed Harry Potter fan. This movie did not push the plot the way I would have liked it to. I do realize that, having read the books, I am naturally inclined to expect the movie to be the same, so I try to go into movies such as this with an open mind. However, this movie did things that differed from the book, and I felt the book did a better job with. The first and foremost thing was the romance between Ginny and Harry. This romance was pushed and forced into our faces more than it needed to. The spontaneity of the book was lost, and I really hated what the movie did. It made it seem like a wishy washy teen romance instead of a realistic teenager in love, like the book did. Another thing I disliked was how it portrayed Slughorn. In the book Slughorn was definitely a man with faults, but he was also an obviously talented wizard that deserved his spot as potion professor. The movie made his seem like a bumbling old fool who was ALWAYS on the verge of tears. The final thing I will address on this review are the private lessons between dumbledore and harry. I felt this movie could have definitely compacted the pointless romances in order to put more attention on the relationship that is developed here. This relationship and the facts learned in their time together are very important in the next movie, and they either skidded over or completely left out huge parts of it. So this movie was anticlimactic and overdone. I would recommend Harry Potter fans to see it, but not to expect much out of it."
738,3,Maybe the worst Harry Potter movie ever !,"First of all , I know that turning a book into a movie is a hell of a job , you can't keep "" All"" the readers satisfied of course , but this one was terrible ! Want to know why ? count with me then : 1. First of all , it is more than a "" Romance - Drama "" movie than fantasy ! what is with all the romance ? was it "" this "" bold in the books ? it's more like a teenager romance movie than one of the best fantasies ever ! 2. Some chapters are really important in the books , they have some effects on the future events and also very cinematic . For one example , there is no such a thing as "" Hogwarts Battle "" in the movie ! ignoring this and putting a bunch of trash "" added by director scenes "" into this movie , really made me sick . 3. One of the most powerful aspects of the books , is their complete attention to the characters . There is no such a thing in this movie . just imagine some one who had not read the book , watching this movie . what would he / she know about Grayback (Warewolf) ? The most important character in this movie - as titled - should be Snape , and how much you can know about him ? "" I'm the half blood prince "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the hell ? why ?!!! Arkin is one of the most powerful actors of these series , and yet nothing about his character in the movie ! There would be a thousand questions about the plot for some one who had not read the books ! "
739,8,Love is in the air at Hogwartz,"With heavy emphasis on attractions to the opposite sex and the jealousy that comes with it, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a transitional tale of both the children's growth and the breaking of light for darkness. The once lively halls of Hogwartz, lined with young children practicing their magicks and playing games with one other has been swapped for dark foreboding paths, barren classrooms and unnaturally looming darkness. The quirky professors of the lighter films, having scattered and banished since The Order of The Phoenix are no longer here to entertain us with their eccentric personas, goofy spectacles and comedic spells. No, this is a very different Hogwartz and Dumbledore's relationship with Harry Potter is more the focus than the raging hormones of he and his friends."
740,7,Once again Harry,"A common rant one is likely to hear about the Harry Potter films is that 'they are not quite upto the books'. The simplest of notions, understandable but a touch absurd really. When a view of this sort is expressed, it is essentially a feeling of disappointment at not being able to connect with the movie on the same level as the book. Absurd in that these are two utterly different forms of artistic expression. I needn't go into the differences, they are numerous - from the time period in which they are savoured to the nature of the sensory experience. If they are so different in the first place, why are they spoken of in the same breadth ? Nobody ever says of a song and a book that have the same roots that one isn't as good as the other. I think it's got something to do with the fact that cinema, for the major part, has been treated as a derivative form in that it needs a source material. In other words, all cinema is essentially an adaptation. We've loved stories for millennia and when the motion picture arrived, the realization was that this was a great medium for telling a story. Only it's not just that. It imparts sensory detail that isn't merely addenda but is capable of standing on its own."
741,10,A filler movie yet still entertaining,"Good movie but its mostly a filler, setting up for the final two. The scenes are very emotional though and cant help but bring a tear to your eye."
742,5,I expected so much more,"In advance, I would like to apologize for my English. There aren't any important spoilers in this review. "
743,8,Exciting and Surprisingly Dark Stuff.,"16-year-old Harry Potter is now in Sixth form at Hogwarts. However, with Voldemort still at large, now with a growing entourage of Death Eaters out to get him, he could be forgiven for putting academics at the back of his mind. Danger is brewing aplenty, including a very ominous meeting occurring between Narcissa Malfoy, Draco's mother, and the ever-ambiguous Professor Snape. What's more, the teenagers Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ron's sister Ginny struggle with their feelings for each other, causing a complicated mess of emotions. Dark times, indeed."
744,8,Captures the Spirit of Rowling's Original Novel,"Let me preface my remarks by saying I am an avid fan of the Potter books, and my review cannot help but be from this perspective. "
745,8,HBP was Verrrry Entertaining But.....,"I went into this movie with no real expectations,though i was dying to see this since i read the book,now i really enjoyed this film a lot it was funny dark scary and sad all in one,a huge upgrade from the very dreary (though well made)OOTP,i will give this a 8 out of 10 simply because of the plot changes,there was absolutely no reason for them,especially giving away the ""Bad Guy"" at the beginning,of course we all knew about that, those of us that read the books,(almost everyone on planet earth)but they should have stuck to the book as much as possible,now one more point id like to make is that i didn't read the 6th book in quite a while so it was much easier for me to enjoy the film,because only main plot points were fresh in my mind,so i would really recommend NOT reading the book again before you watch it if possible,because if you do you will be way more disappointed with the film."
746,10,Such captivating story Bravo JK Rowling,"This movie is one of the most intriguing one yet. It offers a perspective on paths, on decisions, while some might turn to darker paths, the other will find strength, and other (even some professors) would have taken some decisions that now come to regret. Life is a sequence of choices, and nothing proves it better than this movie. It will reveal even more from the now adult characters, and show that they too were students once: Voldermort, Snape, or even Harry's parents, they all have a lot more to their back story than was originally thought. And is not just interesting, but it does make sense to find out more. Some plot twists, some sad moments and yet the movie is still wonderful. Bravo JK Rowling, just bravo."
747,9,A visual treat,"I thought Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was a real treat to watch. I loved the sets, the costumes, the props and particularly the way it was filmed. Visually it was beautiful, lovely to watch. I particularly liked the way the phials of memories in Dumbledore's study were lit up and stored in an elaborate Victorian font cover. I also enjoyed all the railway shots. It was quite long, but it seemed to go quickly. It was entertaining and amusing as well. Malfoy is getting more human and not just the enemy of Harry, it gives the whole thing a little more depth. Bellatrix is delightfully Gothic and over the top and Snape is getting enigmatic and now Harry, Ron and Hermione are poised for a quest.... I look forward to the next one and hope it lives up to the standard of this one."
748,4,Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good.,"Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it's ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it's just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn't detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered."
749,6,"Not the best, worst of them all.","Although this movie did have some great moments, they are far outweighed by the bad. It left out a lot of things that occurred in the book. I do understand that not every word of the book can be translated into the movie, but I definitely feel that they shouldn't have left out some of the things that they did. If you've read the book, you're well aware that Dumbledore shows Harry the memory of Tom Riddle's grandfather and mother. The movie left this out. It also left out the part where Dumbledore explains what items could possibly be horcruxes. The bathroom fight scene between Draco and Harry is mediocre, and not at all what one would expect."
750,7,Teen Crushes vs the Darkest Magic,"Its been a long wait for this film especially after the postponement of its release date from November 21,2008 to July 15,2009. One thing that the postponement was successful in accomplishing was increasing the excitement and the expectations for the movie. And I could never afford to miss the premiere show of HBP in India. "
751,1,David Yates.. HP destroyer !!,"I have said it before ..i'll say again this director have made the worst of Hp movies.. i see that HP 4 is the best HP movie is the one who should've direct the other movies.. i can't believe this ""Yates"" is gonna direct the other last 2 movies as well !!.That will kill the series.i don't know what warner bros seeing in that director!"
752,4,Brief Moments Of Entertainment But That's It!,"This installment is the weakest in the series of Harry Potter films. When I watched this in the theater & rewatched it on DVD, I found it quite boring. It has its brief moments of fun or heartbreak but it's very boring to sit through this whole movie. I'd recommend watching YouTube clips of this movie rather than sitting through all the boring parts of the movie. Although it follows the book (which is also boring) it still doesn't mean it's a good movie. 4/10 is my rating for some brief entertaining moments that gets outweighed by boredom throughout."
753,,ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz. No wow factor.,"If you look at your watch every ten minutes, does it mean you're worried about getting the last bus home? No. But what if others in the theatre start turning their cell phones on? Are they too, worried about the time? No. The movie is terrible in that it takes you absolutely nowhere. It doesn't suspend reality and let you buy into anything for even one scene. As far as shooting the movie goes, it was like stepping into the way back machine after buying a pet rock. There wasn't any good reason to have done it, and now you're clutching a rock that cost you your allowance."
754,5,The Harry Potter soap opera,"Considering only actual readers of the Harry Potter series would ever have a chance of understanding most of what takes place in this film, and focusing one's attention on said readers, the film really only repeats what recent installments of this franchise have been doing to boot: the selection of about one hundredth of the story and the then almost robotic depiction of said portion in a 2 hour and a half long session."
755,6,"They tried to do better than the previous ones, but yet still failed miserably","The Book: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best and biggest book of them all. The drama in the story has had me totally convinced that J.K. Rolling was quite a masterful writer, which understood all the different layers and depth of the English language."
756,3,"Sorry, this was a bad movie.","I'm afraid some of the positive comments posted here on our beloved IMDb have been added by the zealous Harry P. marketing machine. In my humble opinion, no true Harry Potter fan can be satisfied with this movie. "
757,9,A sweet and fresh breath of Harry Potter series,"No matter what you think of HP6 movie, I still love it, and rate it 9/10. Yeah we all know there's no Death Eaters' fight, no Dumbledore's funeral, no Ravenclaw's tiara, no Bill turning into a werewolf, no etc etc. The film somehow mismatched with all other blockbusters this summer, like Star Trek, T4, Transformer 2, where every explosion seems to BOOM right in front of your face. What remains afterward were simple and sweet. Lavender's damp heart on the window, Ron's funny face and quotes when influenced the Love Potion, Hermione's smile when Ron's mumbling, Malfoy's expression when realized the bird was dead... Personally, I think all the cast did an amazing job, fulfilling and blowing life into the characters. Rupert outstandingly succeeded the 10 minutes of ""tragical Ron and the Love Potion"", which really made us believe that Ron's been enchanted. Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right, with jokes and haunting glance saying ""Please"". Tom Felton finally had room to bloom, showing more humanly aspect of Draco. And it was both surprising and delighting to watch Jim Broadbent portraying ""I prefer the whole set"" Prof. Slughorn. Of course, not to mention wicked and scary Helena Bonham Carter (as always), and Alan Rickman's creepy but perfect skill of slip-one-word-at-a-time."
758,1,A Great Book Deserves a (Much) Better Movie,"In Steve Martin's ""Bowfinger,"" we see him looking at index cards thumb tacked to his bulletin board, the traditional way screenwriters note and arrange and rearrange the scenes of the movie they are writing. The trouble with most novels is that they have many more scenes and parts of scenes than can be included in a 2-hour (or even longer) movie, so scenes and story points have to be omitted. The trick is to capture as much of the story and the essence of the novel as you can while still making an interesting and even magical movie."
759,3,"Subtlety is sacked for schticks: sleaze, snogging, and seedy second-rate stagecraft","Let me first say that I am a movie buff of sorts, and I take my time making judgments on films. And the acting in this movie was very good, and visually (other than the Inferi, which looked inhuman and merely repulsive rather than scary) it was appealing. "
760,6,I suggest you read the book first.,"Expectations were particularly higher for this version of Harry Potter for many reasons. It is based on the second last book of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, wherein Ms Rowling reaches a scintillating grasp over the prose she writes and her fans get various insights over the plot of the series taken as a whole. There is the utter darkness of Voldemort's past that is included in this book and though his current self as Lord Voldemort never features greatly in the book, the portrayal of his former self is more than enough to cast a shiver down one's spine – I mean who can forget the rabbit hanging from the rafters? But most importantly, one of the central characters of the book, the mentor, the guide, the teacher leaves the hero alone to face the most famous villain of our times at the very end."
761,10,Love it,I'm going to leave the same review at every Harry Potter film. The Harry Potter film series is seriously the best! I can watch it over and over again and I will never get tired of it. I love this whole magic world and I love how perfectly connected the series are. I was a huge fan when I was a child and I'm surely still are - 10/10!!
762,7,"Great beginning, disappointing execution on the ending",The film started out with what was brilliant with the essence and soul of the book... That is up until the bathroom scene where the soul was ripped from the movie very jarringly only leaving an empty shell of what could have been.
763,8,Harry Potter book vs movie,"The reason this movie is getting rave reviews is because it is an excellent movie. I am getting sick of people comparing the movie to the book. If I wanted to know what took place in the book versus what takes place in the movie, I would read the book. That is the reason that I haven't read any of the books, and I don't intend to until after the movie series is over. I went to the theater to see Harry Potter the movie, not Harry Potter a literal interpretation of the book. My interpretation of the characters has been based on the movie version of these characters, which to my understanding are ""based"" on the characters in the books. Seeing this movie, I was stunned by a certain event which occurs at the end of the film. I understood exactly why the characters involved in the event did what they did, and I didn't feel that I needed to reference the book to see if my understanding was correct."
764,,A superb addition in the series,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince may not be what most people expected. But hey, lets just forget about it and understand that not everything in the book will be in the film. With that aside, it is an improvement from the previous movies."
765,10,Excellent! Just Excellent!,"This is by far one of the greatest movies of the year. The reason it has stuck with me so much is that it feels like much more than a Harry Potter film. The acting was superb,the special effects were awesome,the cinematography is at its best,and the overall story telling is great."
766,10,Dark and epic,One of most beloved character dies. Another known character is the half blood Prince. Watch the film to know the secrets
767,9,What's Yates got in store?,"After watching the first 5 movies I never expected this to be a better adaptation of the book because it is not possible to wrap up 6th book in a span of anywhere under 3 hrs. Also there once again were minor changes to the original plot. Yet inclusion of the battle at the end b/w DA and Order vs Death Eaters could have set it up for a totally different response rather than the current less than expected results. Yet Yates has done a pretty good job in this film. Also the younger cast of this series have acted a lot better and Gambon, Broadbent, and Rickman are simply superb in their roles. I'm a great fan of the Harry Potter books by J.K.Rowling, and I expect that Yates does a fair amount of justice with the Deathly Hallows. The graphics and sound effects in the 6th movie were also remarkably improved and as a movie it was one of the best of the series. I hope for much more better movies in the form of 7th and 8th ones."
768,3,Not for Potter fans.,"Is this film was made without the name Harry Potter, I might have enjoyed it so much more; sadly it was missing all of my favorite scenes. "
769,10,"J.K. is just buying for time, as are the characters, for what's coming...","The narrative of this entry in the series is somewhat thinner compared to the other entries, in the sense there really isn't one. Each entry to this point has a guiding narrative, and all the events of that entry still relate back to that narrative. The only problem I have even remotely with this entry is that the main plot of Draco having to do something horrible for Lord Voldemort is barely the center piece at all."
770,4,awkward!,"I watched this movie as soon as it released in my country, and I felt upset. I watched it with my friend who also a big fan of HP, and we agreed that the movie is the most book-alike, otherwise the most boring one. I don't understand why David Yates prefer Ron comedy scenes than the most important scene of the book! Well, I admit Ron-Hermione/Harry-Ginny love story is very amusing, especially for those who are big fans of them. But should it be?? The best part of the movie are cut down! How BRILLIANT."
771,4,Harry Potter & the Half-Assed Movie,"I didn't hate it like I did PoA. It was a good movie. Great? No. Best out of all the movies so far? Hardly! Better than the last movie? Yes, in some aspects."
772,10,A truly great film for fans of HP,"The sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series delivers everything it should. Action, suspense, comedy, horror and sadness are all done in exactly the right amounts. The movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions, from happy to sad to scared and many other places in between. It is certainly a movie that will have you laughing out loud one minute, gripping the arm of your chair the next, and if you're anything like me, crying your eyes out as well. But it is so worth the ride. I hope other HP fans like my family and I will enjoy it as much as we did. And I hope that it continues to attract new viewers to the series. They haven't all been brilliant, but I think this one is easily the best. Sure they haven't kept everything in from the book, but they can't. It just wouldn't be possible. What they have done though, they have done very well. Well worth the money!"
773,10,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"The clips are a bit messy, and the light is a little dark. Besides, I really can't find anything wrong."
774,7,"Pretty Good, but let down by plot holes and over the top romance","Allow me to begin this review by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter novels and films. The books are sensational and the movies are fairly solid. Half Blood Prince was my 2nd favourite novel, so I was very eager to see the film adaptation. I'll focus on what is enjoyable about the film first, and assess the weaknesses thereafter."
775,8,Very good.,I'm very biased towards this film. It may not be the greatest but i still enjoy this very much
776,1,Worst HP Film Made,*****The only Spoiler is that it's Bad*****
777,6,the next two movies better be amazing,"I am a huge harry potter fan. I have read all the books and waited in line for my copy till 2 am because I couldn't wait any longer to see what would happen next. I have seen every movie the day it premiered and own them all on video. After they got a different director the movies have just been going downhill, but this was just ridiculous. Not only did they leave out several important parts. A few of which were the main reason I had been looking forward to the movie in the first place. They also filled the movie with a bunch of pointless fluff that was barely mentioned in the book. I left the theater feeling disappointed and all that is left to say is the two movies that makeup the 7th book better be amazing."
778,8,Solid adaptation,"Saw this in a cinema. Good adaptation that focuses on the most important elements - character. Really liked the awkward teen romance, really fits the setting. Teens will always be romantic and hormonal even when the world around them is awaiting dread."

780,8,"Not Flawless, but Still Amazing","Since I'm obviously a raw Potterhead, this is always the movie that makes me admit that not the whole Harry Potter franchise is perfect. After David Yates taking over the Potter series and making a perfect movie (Order of the Phoenix) I thought he is not even able to make a mistake in the following parts, but he obviously did manage to make some flaws in the Half-blood Prince. The movie is enjoyable and it holds the watcher's attention the whole time, because the characters (especially the main ones) are still relatable, likeable and simply interesting through the whole story. The plot is a masterpiece as well, perfectly layered and full of new interesting information for the fans, but that's where we come to the main flaw of this movie. It's not a perfect adaptation of the book, as the previous parts were. The Half-blood Prince book is my favourite Harry Potter book, since it's focused on the main antagonist of the entire story, Lord Voldemort. The book is about his history, his origins and his rise, and that is probably the most interesting element of the entire Harry Potter story. Draco Malfoy is the next focus of the story, apperaing a bit rarely than Voldemort, but still enough often. He grows up into a totally new person, mostly forced by his parents but still partly deciding for himself, and since that's a big change, the book talks about it pretty often. Unlike the movie, which is for some reason focused on the teen romance, Ginny and Harry's relationship, as well as Ron and Hermione's one, and the whole thing feels wrong because it doesn't fit the way David Yates presented it. Due to that, he also missed so many important information about Lord Voldemort and Draco, since he took a totally different focus than the book contains. Other than that, the movie still looked very good and David Yates kept the qualities from The Order of the Phoenix (cinematography, props, sets...) but the story made this movie not so perfect like the other parst."
781,9,Harry Potter 6,"When it's Harry Potter, people are going to watch it regardless of anything. I am not saying that this movie lacks to recreate the magic. Actually I would go ahead and say this is the best amongst all that have came until now! This movie has everything in it - drama, emotion, magic and needless to say the impeccable scenes by all the actors. This movie takes the Harry Potter movies to an altogether new level. The scenes between Harry and Dumbeldore are beautifully crafted and will hook you onto to the screen until the end. If you want to compare this movie with the previous one's then I would say that this movie has a darker side than the rest. This is mostly because of the tragic scene at the end of the movie. Even if you have never watched a Harry Potter movie before, it is a must watch. I would give it a 9/10."
782,9,A beautiful and grand set up for the final journey,"Definitely worth the two year wait. HBP wasn't my favorite of the Potter books but the translation to the screen was one of the best and most accurate in the series. The novel truly came to life. Though the novel and film aren't as action packed as OOTP, Harry Potter 6 features some of the best acting to date in the series despite having one of the weaker stories in the series which might confuse those not familiar with the novel."
783,9,Love it but do not know why,I love this film but I do not know why.
784,9,is legendary,The imagination is bold and innovative and the plot is legendary<br /><br />The reversal of the plot is thrilling and readable<br /><br />He has love and love loyalty and betrayal hope and despair adversity and prosperity.
785,4,This film simply missed the point - contains spoilers!,"I was really disappointed in this film, even more so than the previous ones. It left out really relevant and important plot points from the book, confused issues and was so disjointed in places it simply didn't make any sense. Why were Bill and Fleur left out of the film altogether? Why not say that Greyback was a werewolf and responsible for Remus' condition? Why bring in Bellatrix? And why dumb down Dumbledores death scene so much it became meaningless? You were given no idea whatsoever of Snapes torment at what had to be done because of the desperate situation he had been placed in, nor of Harrys frustration of being genuinely immobilised and helpless (and invisible under his cloak) because he was none of those - just lurking in the shadows (which of course not one death eater bothered to check - yeah, right!) As for burning down 'the Burrow', well, my hopes that the final films would somehow redeem the series and pull everything together plummeted completely. Also, I've read the cast list for the films to follow and they leave out some very important characters indeed, which doesn't fill me with optimism. When they announced they were making films that would be true to the spirit of the books, it sounded good. The end products have been, at best, disappointing and this chunk was by far the worst yet. They've tripped it of everything that made the books so readable and ought to have made the films watchable - they are simply heartless, commercial, bland, blatant. cynical money making exercises which takes a well known phenomena and uses it for its own ends."
786,7,"Not just good, very good!","Masterful installment in the Harry Potter series and the only estimable work since Prisoner of Azkaban. Following two gloomy films, I enter Half Blood Prince skeptical, and understably so. Once again, the work is dark and brooding and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry seems drearier than a nursing home. The storyline is clearly good, but the filmmaking must stand as an altogether separate work. "
787,7,a great refresher for any book fan,"I've been watching Harry Potter Movies for like seven years now, and each one has disappointed me. I keep thinking that they aren't so much movies, as visual presentations of the best scenes from the books. I keep thinking you just really couldn't follow them if you hadn't read the books. But then who hasn't read the Harry Potter books right? Well my wife for one. She'll read Twilight, but not Harry Potter. Okay okay, I'm not here to complain about my wife's reading habits. I wish she had never read the Twilight books, but then I bought them for her because I knew she would enjoy them. ANYWAY, I thoroughly enjoyed the new Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I think this was because I really enjoyed all the scenes they chose from the book, and I really liked how dark this one started to get. I thought it was a pretty good example of the how much things change from about the ages of sixteen to eighteen, how you really start to lose that last bit of childhood innocence. I also thought this movie worked pretty well as a moral allegory for the moral choices that start to emerge at the close adolescence. As you lose that last bit of childhood innocence, you really have to start admitting that your choices negatively and positively impact the people around you. You start to create your own sense of morality, you start to decide what moral guidelines influence your decision making."
788,5,Alright but kind of disappointing,Overall this movie was not that bad. However I will say that some parts of the book were completely destroyed by this movie. They took out necessary or large parts of the novel and put in random scenes that were never in the book and that served no purpose. I realize that they need to cut things out of the movies because the books are so long but they did not even make good use of the time they had because of the scenes they added that should not have been there. I also felt they focused too much on the relationship aspect and took out a whole bunch of important details that will make the events in the 7th movie much harder to explain in my opinion. I think the writers were relying on people who read the books to understand the back stories that they never explained at all in the movie. Overall it was an okay film but parts of it just left me extremely disappointed.
789,7,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,i will be Honest i have never read any of the hp books well i have read first few Chapters of order of the Phoenix that aside i can understand after reading some of the reviews why fans of the books are upset when you make a movie based on a book you expect to see what you have read on the big Screen whats the point of making the movie if you are going to miss big chucks out/important parts out having not read the books i would not know whats missing that said now i know whats missing i can see why i found some scenes confusing and making no scents we never found out what the half blood prince is i don't mind romance but this was ott i was disappointed there was hardly any action from what i have read in other reviews there should have been a battle in hogwarts but it was cut out what a shame most of the cast where on top form enjoyed the film but would have enjoyed it more if all the missing links were in place(aka missing scenes from book)i hope they every last detail from the last book in the next two movies (thats why its in 2 parts hopefully)so at least the series can go out on high note 
790,6,I was somewhat disappointed,"The movie title is barely explained--we don't know why the Half Blood Prince is important to the overall story--its never explained. Aside from the reference to him in the book and the revelation that it is Snape, we know nothing about the Half Blood Prince."
791,4,sob sob,"i cant believe i am saying this but this must be the worst of the potter films i have seen!! i am a big fan of the books and the other 5 films but watching this addition of the potter films left me thinking have i finally out grown harry potter. i found myself watching it with excitement and just ending upi really disappointed. i have read the book and it was really good with all the little twist and basically bring an end to the some of the stories which left us all guessing. but the film just didn't give me the same feeling it just seems that harminone is out growing these film as she is just growing as an actor and i think we will see big things from her in the future but the others just seem to be flogging a dead horse!! daniel radcliff just seems to be out growing the role of harry and just giving him a tranparent and one style acting method which i thought would develop with more experience but i am mistaken. As for ron whesley, i love this actor but again he is the same he i bring nothing new to the role and is becoming predictable and boring!! as for the editing well i think have done as much as they could for the time they where given but again as all the others they have missed so much out so if you haven't read the books you cannot understand some of the little sub stories which are going on. i think i may just have to wait for the 7th installment to come and see how they are going to end the series."
792,9,Dark secrets revealed.,"In terms of the entire franchise, along side Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is always looked at as not up to par with the rest of the series and one of the weaker installments. However, to me it manages to be one of my favorites of the bunch and one I constantly find myself always going back to."
793,5,ho hum,"It would be a reasonably sure bet that if someone has seen the prior films they will be seeing this one. In other words a sure-fire hit. As such you might expect they'd relax some of the requirements forced upon a big budget film - i.e. less emphasis on action and focus on the story. But alas not. And to rub salt into the wound is the nature of the action. The opening and that rather chaotic somethingorother in the middle at the Weasley residence is really quite forced and uninteresting; another would be the inclusion of Quiddich-why do that when its involvement in the development of Ginny & Harrys relationship is cut? Speaking of that, there is no development it just sort of muddles along through a series of disjointed events and is whittled down to a lone kiss. No actual relationship. Development indeed."
794,2,Better than the next and the last but overall still not that great,"While nowhere near as bad as the order of the phoenix or the bloated mess that was deathly hallows, it still fails to live up to even the fourth movie in the series, in fact it almost feels as if it's a more boring version of that fourth movie."
795,9,An Epic Treat For The Eyes And Ears! Don't let it leave the cinema before you see it,Okay so I'll divide this into each quality of the film.
796,3,"Not the content, but the presentation put me off.","Although I had read the book, my sieve-like mind had forgotten all of the details, so the differences between the book and the movie that bothered many other viewer didn't bother me."
797,3,Same old Same old,"I was eagerly waiting to see this movie as I'd seen all the other five, and I had to resort to begging my children now teenagers to go to the cinema with me..."
798,,The half-blood prince,"The movie is the sixth of Harry Potter series. This starts from the scene that Harry and Dumbledore go to the house of Horace who was a teacher in the Hogwarts to ask him to come back to the school as a teacher of Posions. The reason why they want Horace to return is he know the secret of Voldemort. They want to know that and to have a hint to defeat Voldemort. Harry tries to get the secret from Horace many times. Finally, Horace tells him about the secret that Voldemort cuts his own spirit into seven with a magic which is called Horcrux. That is Voldemort does not die until his seven spirits are destroyed. At the end of the movie, Dumbledore is killed by death eaters and Snape. This last scene is very surprising. I enjoy the movie and want to watch other series."
799,6,Heed the warnings. Movie falls dreadfully short of preceding ones,"I've enjoyed the first 5 movies to date without having read the books or needing to. But this movie was obviously off the pace of its predecessors. My wife who has read every book was able to answer my 30 some questions. Which leaves me pondering why the producers who have done so well with the previous movies, botched this one up Soooo badly. As you read around the other reviews they make it clear what is missing from the books. But even a person such as myself could tell the pacing and characters were way off. Don't get me wrong. The actors have grown and the movie focused on their personal growth and relationships. We got to see more of everyones growth including specific bad guys like Draco. The special effects were as always top notch but i would expect no less from a Potter movie. But not the blockbuster I was hoping for. No great magic fight in the school. Missing characters. Many explanations not offered as it's assumed everyone read the books. Overall. It just fell short. Hopefully the final 2 part movie covering book 7 will overcome all the short comings of this movie."
800,6,Sadly one of the weaker movies in the series,"""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was once again directed by David Yates. During his sixth year at Hogwarts Harry discovers a book that is ""Property of the Half-Blood Prince"", meets an old friend of Dumbledore, Horace Slughorn and learns more about the past of Lord Voldemort."
801,8,Nicely done,"Very pleasant of the eyes in terms of cinematography, but still not up to the mark of the OoP.<br /><br />One of the well done HP movies. I only wish the Bellatrix-Burrow scene didn't happen. Apart from not being in the book, it makes no sense at all, security system wise.<br /><br />Everything else really worked, great acting on all parts, especially Radcliffe's"
802,8,Lord of Cuts,Having seen this movie just few days ago... must take its toll. And thereof i MUST see the DVD release (hence making the second look) before making any permanent opinions. But as first look opinion here is mine.
803,,The worst movie adaption of the Harry Potter series,"If you are a fan of Harry Potter, then you will certainly like the novel ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. In fact, it's my favorite novel of the series. But what about the film? The film is nothing but a disappointment, I'm very sorry to say that. Just imagine, the novel brought us such pleasure, but the movie... only disappointment. Yes, the fact that the filmmakers have to make the movie shorter so that the audiences do not feel bored is true, but why did they put all the unimportant scenes in the movie? For example, the scene of the Burrow burning down, is it there in the novel? No it wasn't there. So why did the filmmakers waste such precious time by putting that scene in the movie, huh? That was one of the things that made the movie longer. Yes, that scene was exciting, but it was too unimportant. Where were the scenes where Tonks finds out Harry in the train, Madam Rosmerta is shown under the Imperius curse, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, etc., etc? The filmmakers didn't put these scenes in the movie. The thing that hurts me the most is that most of Tom Riddle's memories are missing. Those were perhaps the most important and the most interesting parts in the book."
804,9,Definitely the best of the Potter franchise so far!,"I can honestly tell you that I have been a Potter fan for more than half of my life. I have grown up with the Potter books and they matured at the same time I matured and at the very same rate. The five previous Potter films didn't always impress me. I adore Chamber of Secrets and the Sorceror's Stone, they contained the same feel of magic and wonder that the books did, the feeling of being new to Hogwarts and the wonder of the mysteries that reside there. Afterwards, the films got a bit choppy. I always felt that certain important plot points and bits of things that made the books my favorite, lacked to communicate with the big screen. "
805,,Totally agree,"I totally agree with you. I am a huge Harry Potter, and i was so looking forward to this movie. If I hadn't read the books and I thought this was a romantic comedy I would probably think it was good...but this is Harry Potter people, what happened? There is no suspense, no dark side, no thrill, nothing. The important parts of the history pass like a flash, some characters like Hagrid don't even have an important role...I left the theatre wanting to write to warner bros and ask for my money back. There is no excuse for this cuz they have been doing a great job so far. I won't even comment on the ending, it's just ridiculous."
806,8,A Very Well Done Installment in the HP Series,"I'm glad that I saw this film in theatres for the first time last month. The directing is very inspired and I love the slow transformation of Harry and Dumbledore's relationship from a mentor-student one to a somewhat more balanced one. Also, this film shows once again that romantic relationship choices is not JKR's strong suit. Harry and Hermione have so much chemistry together (or at least Daniel and Emma)!"
807,8,"Funny,Richly colored, and dark.","While some people may see this Harry Potter as a disappointment, I find it to be quite the opposite. While the movie does leave some parts out, David Yates did a good job cutting down the book so that it had a reasonable running time but still had key points in the story. Daniel Raddcliffe (Harry Potter) Was excellent, Although he was not as good compared to his older peers, such as the always wonderfully dark Alan Rickman(Severus snape), and the Manic and beautiful Bonnie Wright as Bellatrix Lestrange. The Cinematography was beautiful, capturing the dark yet rich tone of the movie. Also, I found this movie much more humorous then the past installments. Emma Watson is amazing at capturing the sweet yet troubled in love Hermione, and Rupert Grint gives a funny yet only passable performance as Ron Weasley.Bonnie Wright was the only Actress who I found to be very terrible at playing her role, which was a very easy one. In the few scenes in which she appeared, Bonnie gave a flat, Rather card-board performance as Ron's sister and Harry's love interest. The special effects were once again fantastic, and the final quidditch match in the series was well done.While I do advise viewers to get a little background info from reading the book or consulting a friend who knows about the series before seeing the movie, simply because it can get a little confusing. Over all, Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince is a Great and Triumphant movie."
808,7,Here we are again...,Here we are again with an installment to this potentially epic saga that has produced another bittersweet result.
809,7,Let the games begin,"This movie is about the time when harry learns that the evil has become so great that what was on safe might not be anymore. The world is changing and they all have to fight back, all the card are being laid on the table and the fight for who is gonna win has become a race/game."
810,9,A great improvement from the previous movies,"The problems with all of the Harry Potter movies so far have been that the director hasn't had complete control over the project because not all the books were out, so the complete story wasn't known. That meant that should a detail that becomes important at the end be left out, massive problems could be caused. This gave the Potter films a very rushed and very complex plot, which alienated audiences. Half Blood Prince is the first movie out since the final book was released, so director David Yates had complete creative control, and let me be the first to say the improvements are incredible."
811,5,Worst in the bunch,"As a huge fan of the entire Harry Potter series, especially the sixth book, I have to say I become more disappointed each time I watch it. The main focus of the director and screenwriter was to make it funny and entertaining, and so they let the overall point of the story fall to the wayside. They go through important scenes too briefly, leaving little room for character development, and spend too long on scenes that have no value to the story as a whole. The book was about the pending final battle with Lord Voldemort, and the funny scenes, and the parts dealing with the characters' various relationships, were added in as comic relief. The movie was the opposite. It was all about entertaining the audience, and the important parts were just stuck in randomly. They really overdid the romance and the consequential drama, focusing way too much on that aspect of the story."
812,1,"Awesome trailer, horrible movie","I went to the theaters to finally see Public Enemies at which they cancelled due to the amount of people wanting to see the new Harry Potter. I was not too upset considering the trailer for the movie looked much better than the previous films. I have read up to the fourth Harry Potter book so I had nothing to compare the movie to in terms of the sixth book. That being said the movie was awful. Even if I had read the book I would say the same thing. If your a fan of the books then I'm sure you will go see this, but I strongly advise against it. The beginning sucked you in with decent visual effects and what looked like three smoke monsters terrifying the muggles. After that part, which lasted a minute or two, I had to wait an hour and half to see Dumbledore defeat hundreds of Gollums with a storm of fire, but before that I had to sit through an hour and a half watching each of the characters trying to get laid. The best part of this movie experience or lack there of, was the popcorn."
813,2,The destruction of the book,"Tua half blood prince Is by far the worst Harry Potter movie. Too many scenes were cut, too many scenes were changed, and some illogical and pointless scenes were added"
814,7,Still great,I love all the movies of H.P. But as the book was much better and I much understood from the book than the movie. I wish if the movie didn't cut that much from this book. Still great movies and great books.
815,5,Here We Go Again!!!,"IS it that time again? Another Harry Potter movie!!! I was the unfortunate one to have to go and see it to write this crummy review. It was awful! i can't believe im saying this, but the PG version ones were actually better than this 6th installment of the Harry Potter series. First off, 2 hours and a half!!! i mean, for half the movie, we were just looking at Harry and his stupid fat head! he didn't even wear the scar in this movie! disgraceful! i think i should be the new harry potter! i mean, im charming, sexy, intelligent, six pack... anyway, lets move on. They should make this movie go quicker. The camera moves so slowly that i could've gone to China and back again and still the camera would be looking at Harry Potter crying over something retarded. And whats with him liking Ginny! i mean, he has all these hot girls (or men, i saw u Frank'n'furter)and he goes for the wranger who is younger than him! i mean, im not gonna go up to a girl thats in 2nd grade whilst im in 10th grade and ask her out! that's just disgusting! Anyway, im gonna have to wrap this up soon. So that idiot has given this a 5 out of 10. the next harry potter is split in two, so i guess about 4 hours for each movie. there wasn't much clips of harry potter ruddy crying that they gotta add more. That idiot is out!!"
816,,"Plot, character development, exciting action? You're a year too early.","The sixth Harry Potter film, ""Half-Blood Prince"", is very well crafted but it serves no purpose besides setting up a sequel. If you desire plot, strong character development, climactic action you're a year too early. For all the wasted time and effort that went in to ""Half-Blood Prince"" I can only hope that ""Deathly Hollows"" is the next ""Citizen Kane""."
817,5,A Disappointed HP fan,"Wow as a huge Harry Potter fan I was so looking forward to seeing THBP,,,I almost cried when it was put back 6 months,,, I was so sure this was going to be THE best HP film as the book is bloody marvellous."
818,4,For Harry Potter geeks everywhere... a disappointment.,"*Continuous SPOILERS throughout* Okay, as a major Harry Potter geek, i expected to walk into the theatre to experience all the emotions, the darkness, and the magic that i saw in the book. Disappointingly, it had little to none. Lets start at the beginning... it was slightly random... no Dumbledore picking Harry up from the Dursleys, just Harry in a grimy café, hitting on a muggle girl. I didn't see the point in that. I will say, though, that i found Jim Broadbent as a near-perfect Slughorn, persuaded out of retirement by Dumbledore."
819,4,Weakest of the bunch,"I have been over Harry Potter for awhile and I feel the movies have been going downhill since the 3rd one; but Half Blood Prince made me realize that the previous movies were actually rather good. This movie had such mediocre acting, bad acting, (and what was up with the lighting) that I had to scratch my head wondering why nobody stopped this before too much money was spent. If I remember correctly Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince are around the same length, so why did the former movie seem to be so much better constructed than this one? This movie jumps all over the place and has a couple of really pointless scenes, and the writer/director makes the characters do some idiotic things. I feel sorry for anyone who has not read the books because this movie, unlike previous ones, will seem quite confusing if you had not read the book or finally decided to go see your first HP movie. Emma Watson has been the poster child for bad acting amongst the younger cast members since about Goblet of Fire; but she had a lot of company with this movie. Rupert Grint gave about a 3 performance, and honestly I think his character could have gone on vacation for all he added to the film. Daniel Radcliffe was so off and on with his lines and scenes that it was almost painful to watch. He has never seemed so stiff and out of touch with his character before; perhaps the writing caused him to not know what his characters motivation was in certain scenes. The actress playing Ginny Weasly was atrocious as was her character! How could so many people be involved in this movie yet nobody took the time to prevent the inclusion of Ginny tying Harry's shoe or feeding him cookies? Not only was Ginny written as a doormat but the actress gave her so little personality that she could have been scenery. Tom Felton's performance had to grow on me but he was definitely at the top of his game in this film, too bad he didn't give his co-stars pointers. The lines he had to say were pretty bad, but he gave it his best shot; and all around I would give him an 8. 3 other things were missing from the movie: Jason, Alan, and Helena. All 3 have an uncanny ability to steal every scene they are in and Alan and Helena were used too little in this film when Alan especially should have had much more screen time. Jason was expected to be absent but I would have made up a scene so he could appear because he is truly that good."
820,9,One of the best of the movies,"In my opinion this is one of the best of the movies, focusing on the human strengths and weaknesses of the various characters as the war approaches. Particularly good: Felton as Draco, trapped between Voldamort's orders and what's left of his human decency; Slughorn, not just a pompous name-dropper but an aging has-been trying to win his new students' respect; Gambon of course gets Dumbledore's best scenes of the series and lives up to them; Ginny comes out of the background to offer Harry love and moral support when he most needs it; Luna is back, as dotty and as helpful as ever."
821,3,Sux,"The acting is 100% but the history was changed, and lots of things was not show. The battle in the school at the end of the book, is missing, one of the best part of the book, was no show. The Kiss of Harry on the movie was different too from the book. Was far way more exciting on the book. things that was not in the book was on the movie."
822,9,"Best HP movie yet, almost","I really liked it. I don't understand why people keep moaning about how it's different from the book, if you want all your favourite parts from the book, just read the book. About the exclusion of back stories, you do realise the back stories are recounted using the pensive, that means Harry is only a bystander, you wouldn't even see him in the scenes. If they put all the back stories in, you would get 30min of Voldy and his dear mummy, daddy, grandpa,and uncle, Snape, his folks and a young Lily. And it would means 30mins less of Harry and the trio. I don't think the non-readers audience are OK with that, I believe they'd rather have 30mins of RomCom of the trio. From a commercial point of view, I think they've made the right decision."
823,7,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. Since the movies started coming out, I have not been a fan of them. None of the movies seemed to capture the feel of the book. They all seemed to get over-weighted by the arrogance of their own medium, focusing more on special effects and over-acting to get the story across. In Yates last installment wasn't stellar, though I had come to expect little, and got slightly more expected with that one."
824,1,Disappointment and Shock,"When Harry Potter first came out, I was immensely impatient to see it. Each time a new Harry Potter movie was advertised, I would sit there, counting down the days, until it was released on DVD so that I may purchase and watch it. "
825,10,Harry Potter Grows Up Brilliantly,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is an outstanding movie and a wonderful addition to the Harry Potter series. The book has two main focuses: Voldemort's back story and the setup for the war that occurs in Deathly Hallows. In terms of Voldemort's back story the movie does a fantastic job in bringing to life the memories that were included. The memory depicting the first meeting between Dumbledore and young Tom Riddle is just about perfect. And the way the memories of Riddle getting the information on Horcruxes from Slughorn. The portrayal of Riddle's hesitancy, casualness, and calmness that succeeded in attaining the information he wanted. It is a flaw in the movie that the memory of Riddle visiting the old lady with that unusual name I'd never heard of where Riddle first sees Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's Locket. While the story of the Locket isn't hurt that much in the movie because it's clear when it appears that it is a Horcrux the Cup is the bigger issue. In Deathly Hallows Part 2, viewers who haven't read the books will have had no introduction to the Cup and will be confused about the how and why of it being a Horcrux. When making the book to movie transition I would have cut out that retarded Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff and instead included more Voldemort memories, especially the memory where he learns of the Cup and Locket. The memories that were well done and wonderfully brought to life but at least one more should have made the cut. As for the war setup this was pretty well done. This is the volume at which Harry Potter has truly become dark. Sorcerers Stone was charming and innocent. The next four movies were mixed with Chamber of Secrets tilting lighter and Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix tilting darker. But Half Blood Prince is truly and completely dark. From start to finish the tension is palpable as one thing after another leads to serious tone. We start with a muggle bridge collapse, have Katie's tragedy, and climax with Dumbledore's death. The characters come off as hardened by what's going on around them. The last of childhood innocence is gone and everyone and everything has grown up. The acting is great as it always is in Harry Potter. Daniel and Emma are splendid in their main character roles. Love Evanna in her role as Luna. I'd have liked to have seen Luna have a bigger role in both the movie and the book but I tell you what, Evanna does a beautiful and memorable job with what she is given. And although he never reaches Richard Harris performance, Michael Gambon gives his best performance in the Dumbledore role in Half Blood Prince. And of course Alan Rickman is still deliciously perfect as the complex Snape. What's interesting here is that the significance of Dumbledore's death and the circumstances surrounding it and events leading up to it aren't apparent until you've either read or watched Deathly Hallows. This is largely a setup story but you don't really know what's being set up until Deathly Hallows. I like that the cinematography has gone dark to match the tone of the stories. This is well shot film with a fitting atmosphere and color scheme. Nicholas Hooper does a good job on the score but I'll always wish John Williams could have done the whole Harry Potter series. One thing I'd like to single out is that I much prefer how Dumbledore's death is treated in the movie than the book. The students wand tribute is much more genuine and heartfelt than the more formal and stately funeral in the book. The pacing is uneven. The first third and final third of this movie are totally awesome baby! But I do find myself fast forwarding quite a bit during the second third. I really could have done without the romance/sexuality stuff. More Voldemort memories would have been better. Nevertheless I give a full 10 here because this movie is greater than the sum of its parts. The relevant parts are beautifully brought to life. And the movie has an emotional sincerely about it, especially during the tragic climax. Due to darkness and emotional intensity this movie should only be people in middle school or older. The bridge collapse, Katie's tragedy, and especially Dumbledore's death are far too emotionally intense for elementary school children. I don't know why this wasn't PG-13. Also elementary school children will likely find this movie less interesting than the first five Harry Potter movies as it's slower paced with less action and more setup and has no child appeal elements. Overall Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a wonderful movie that earns its stripes. Faithfulness to the Book: 8 out of 10. Casting and acting: 10 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 10 out of 10. Music: 7 out of 10. Pacing: 6 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10. Greater than the sum of its parts."
826,8,Sonicly fun and entertaining... yet somewhat confusing?,"I liked this film. I can see why people who are fans of the books (I am one too) might be annoyed with this film as it does take a few liberties with the plot. It misses a lot, and it would be interesting to know if people who aren't familiar with the books are completely confused by this movie. But then what it does, it does well: *Warning Spoilers Ahead* Harry's character is getting more depth, he's less of a good two shoes and more real. I am still not really believing his romance with Ginny, though Bonnie Wright was great. I just want to know what the hell was going in with his character at the start, riding around on trains and flirting with waitresses? Ron and Hermione's budding romance might annoy some, but as it is one of my favorite part of the books I loved it. It's awkward, sweet and it really manages to capture that strange and beautiful feel of teenage love. It might have been a bit obvious, but at least it didn't give away too much and it's still not right out in the open. Lavender is a bit over the top, but I think it works."
827,7,A good Harry Potter film but not as good as I expected,"I saw this film expecting it to be great, even better then the Order of the Phoenix, which in my opinion is the best Harry Potter film. But it wasn't as good as the fifth one. I read the book which I thought was great but the movie just didn't live up to expectations. It seemed like the director focused more on love and romance then the darkness that is happening in the film. It wasn't until the ending of the film where the movie seemed to shift it's plot from romance to fighting Voldemort and the Death Eaters. The ending battle was cut out of the film because there will be one similar in the Deathly Hollows part two and I can understand that but the battle scene was really cool in the book and the fight between Snape and Harry was only a couple minutes long with little dialogue exchange and Dumbledore did not have his funeral but it might be in the Deathly Hallows part 1. The battle scene between Snape and Harry was powerful in the book but not to great in the movie. So this movie is good, but not great like I expected it to be."
828,5,David Yates fails again...,I understand that The Half Blood Prince has got a high score IMDb and an exceptionally good rating at Rottentomatoes but I will explain my reasons in detail for rating it so lowly.
829,10,just outstanding!,"I'm gonna start by saying i'm a huge Harry Potter fan, so i know every detail of almost every book."
830,5,Anti-climatic,"Talk about a letdown, I just couldn't believe they left out the most important part of the book. Why did the death eaters even enter Hogwarts? They didn't do anything but watch and play around blowing some windows out when leaving. It was like the screen writers just forgot what this book was about and left the main part out. If they needed more time they could have left out scenes that were not even in the book like Harry and Ginny running through the talk grass in the burrow and the burning of the Weasley home. They could have saved at least 5 minutes there and I can think of many other things that were unnecessary. You would think they would query the fans before writing the final script. Where was J. K. during this process? I can't believe she would approve. I was very disappointed."
831,4,"Too long, Too Boring.",I'm not by any means a fan of Harry Potter. I was invited by friends to go catch the sold out show at the theater for a night out. I have read the first three Harry Potter books when i was younger but gave up soon after. I have only seen the first two movies and then this one.
832,9,S*** just got real,Plot: 9<br /><br />Acting: 9<br /><br />Script: 9<br /><br />Directing: 10<br /><br />Cinematography: 9<br /><br />Musical Score/sound editing/mixing: 9<br /><br />Visual effects: 9<br /><br />Setting: 9<br /><br />Characters: 10<br /><br />Symbolism/themes or overall feel: 9<br /><br />TOTAL: %92
833,8,The worst HP Movie,"I don't hate that movie, but for a HP movie, the whole movie isn't really good...maybe because Dumbledore dies, I'm not sure...<br /><br />The movie is still a good one and very important for the story.."
834,7,Pretty Lame,"The Harry Potter franchise will only be remembered for its novels, the movies are horrible compared to the books. The sixth book was way too much different from the movie. The acting and movies were horrible once again. Snape and Malfoy in the book hated Harry Potter much more in the book than the movie. Characters that should have played a big role in the film should have been: the new Minstry of Magic (but he isn't seen or mentioned in the film). Romlinda Vane allows appears in one scene, and doesn't play a big role at all. Why does Tonks look so different, the werewolf played a much smaller role than the book (he doesn't even speak in the film). Some of the stuff in this film should have been rated PG-13, like when Harry Potter used the Sectumsempra spell on Malfoy. Slughorn in the flashbacks doesn't look any younger than the present time. Pretty sloppy acting, lines, and directing. I wouldn't waste your time seeing this. The book is much more interesting."
835,1,Only god knows how disappointed I am...,"Hey guys, I got to see the HBP at it's midnight screening. I was so excited about it, I practically bought tickets two weeks in advance. After 2 and a half hours, I was awestruck. Not with delight, but with utter disappointment. As a die-hard HP fan, I was looking forward to this movie more than any of the others, such as the battle of Hogwarts, Dumbledore's death and funeral, as well as the journey into Riddle's past. Quite unfortunately, almost all of the above plot elements were cut out of the movie. Now, we have all had our experiences with cutting out plot points in HP movies, but the entire point of HBP was Riddle's past! They barely included any of that stuff! Now, I can't remember all of the points they missed, but you can look at any of the other reviews and find out. At that point, I thought it couldn't get any worse. I was wrong. It's one thing to cut out things, but to add in stuff that never even happened!?!?! When I saw the scene of the burrow burning down, my thoughts raced, thinking, did that ever happen? Did I miss a chapter? Then, I realized there was a general sense of confusion in the theater. Yet another downside to this movie was the almost complete lack of deep emotion. Add that to the cheap and one sided humor of the completely un-important Lavender Brown, and you had a disaster. The main point is, if we don't want a complete mess up of films 7, both parts one and two, David Yates better get his act together, or else Harry will have been killed."
836,4,Watchable but only just,"First I'm not a massive die hard read all the books 14 year old harry potter fan, I'm in my 30s and have watched the other harry potter films when they have basically come on the TV and enjoyed them so thought id give this one a go. Hugely disappointing!! The plot and the story line are Sooooooooooooo slow at one point I fell asleep for 20 Min's on the sofa and when I woke up it was as if I hadn't missed anything the plot was still dragging along at a snails pace. Very little action but lot and lots of deep meaningful 'we are so big and popular now we don't need lots of action' drivel."
837,1,David Yates is Harry Potter Franchise's biggest mistake,"Overall the worst among the series. From start to finish the plot is dull, dreary, and unbearable. To kill Dumbledore without the burial that marked his quality as being the greatest wiz of all time is just downright a scam. Might as well just let him willingly jump off the Astronomy tower."
838,9,Heart Wrenching,"The Harry Potter series has definitely had my interest since the beginning. I bought my ticket for this film a month in advance, and when I arrived opening night at 9:45 PM there was already a line. The Half-Blood Prince is without a doubt the best film yet in my opinion. Though it did not strictly follow the book, the film adaptation was amazing. This film relies on the viewers assumption of certain events, since conveying every detail the book contained would result in a 15 hour movie. Nonetheless, the director did very well in including the essential parts, the guts if you will, that make the Harry Potter series what it is. This film, however, had a separate feel from the rest of the series."
839,6,A middling adaptation,"Though I was rather disappointed with the tiresome attempts to make a optimistic yet serious book into a 'comedy for the family', and the pathetic acting in the initial stages of the film, and the fact that the filmmakers left out so many essential sub-plots and events that would otherwise render the movie incomprehensible to a non-reader; I was impressed with the special effects and the terrific latter half of the film. Even though the filmmakers chose to compress a lot of the core of the book in just a few moments, it's still executed well enough to warrant the 153 minute run-time. "
840,8,Best Harry Potter Book and a good movie,"""Half-blood prince"" is my favorite Harry Potter book and the movie was pretty good. The movie left out a lot of key details but that's not something to worry about because they can't put everything into the movie or the movie would be 12 hours. So, if you want to watch a 12 hour Harry Potter movie you might as well just read the book. I liked how well detailed the memory scenes of Tom Riddle are done and there is a lot of humor added to this movie. I thought it was hilarious when sexual jokes were made in the movie and everyone was laughing except for the 10 year olds and under. I thought it was hilarious that they didn't get the jokes and was shocked that the movie got only a ""PG"" rating because it does incorporate a good bit of suggestive material."
841,6,Meh.,"I am not a big harry potter fan, and I would not rate any of the series more then 7 out of 10. Definitely not good enough to top either The prisoner of Azkaban or The Goblet of Fire. "
842,8,"Most Underrated, But I liked It!","After seeing this movie in the Cinemas i was slightly let down. The trailer looked awesome but the film wasn't as good. When i got it on DVD i enjoyed it a lot more abd understood the stoyline a lot more. Some scenes were comical and Romantic. Sadly it's one of the underrated ones, i don't think it was as entertaining as the first four i certainly was quite impressed from the outcome and a big improvement from the last Harry Potter. It was quite a dark film and i thought the last 20 minutes were brilliant and action packed. It was good to find about Horcruxes and it was sort of the beginning of the end. You have to watch this one to watch the Deathly Hallows."
843,8,great movie with stunning visuals!,harry potter and the half blood prince is the sixth installment in the franchise and to be honest with you this is probably one of the best harry potter films in the franchise it is probably 2nd in best looking film next to deathly hallows part 2 and they did a tremendous nice job with the special and visual effects it should have received a academy award for this movie is pure beautiful and the directing in this movie is wonderful and it hits you hard with deep satisfying music and art direction and again the acting is great as always but it seems like it has gotten enhanced up to this point in the franchise so in my opinion and reaction i would say that this movie is a great movie that will be enjoyed but there are some flaws that could get in the way of the movie when viewing but at times it can be ignored it depends on what type of person you are so i would give this film a low B+ to a high A-
844,9,Let the film speak for itself,"There is so much to enjoy in this film. The humour quotient has been upped, the budding romances are both amusing and, in Hermione's case, affecting and it is one good looking film. However, as a passionate fan of the novels there were moments - not least the violent events at the Weasleys' home at Christmas - which jarred. I wanted to shout, 'but, but, but that's not in the book!' So, there is a health warning for book nuts like me - let go of your need for this film to be faithful to the details of the book and let it speak for itself. Do that and you may see that this film is faithful to the spirit of Rowling and you'll be in for a funny, exciting and thrilling time."
845,6,"Of Harry Potter movies, Daniel Radcliffe's hair looks the worst in this one","I saw this in theaters, and I watched it tonight a second time with my whole family to celebrate my daughter finishing the 6th book. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint have good chemistry, and their friendly scenes together made some of the best moments."
846,4,There is no point to this movie other than preparing you and your wallet for the next one.,"Went to see this movie this afternoon with my kids, and this is by far the worst of the entire series."
847,7,Nice continuation of the incredibly immersive Harry Potter books,"He sixth installment in the incredibly popular wizard series carries on the tradition of following the books. The half-blood prince probably won't bring with it the expectations that came with the Philosopher's stone but then it is expected to be lower key as the franchise comes to a closure- there remains just one more book after this (deathly hollows). However, this film is darker in tone and should be headed for more mature territory just like the series."
848,4,"Maybe the best book of the series, for sure the worst movie so far","Too much romance, almost no action, if they had a short time to tell the story, why would they make up nonexistent scenes?! Why did the picture need to be so dark and depressing? The depressing book was Order of Phoenix, Half Blood prince was a good mood book with a sad ending, not an entirely sad book. Where's the quidditch finals? Where's the fight at the ending (I was expecting this so much! :( )? Where's Dumbledore funeral! Almost all the nice parts of the book were cut from the movie..."
849,6,Why Why Why???,Spoilers!!! I'm disappointed! I really don't understand why this movie had so many differences from the book.
850,8,Harry Potter & The Half Blood Prince - Spine-Chilling Fantasy Thriller,"Just back after the FDFS of one of the most awaited movies of this year, the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series where Harry starts his sixth year at the Hogwarts school, in IMAX format, my first experience in this format..."
851,2,hp and the half-blood prince genre: romantic comedy,"first i want to write that i registered to IMDb only so i could comment on this film...i'v never seen such a disappointing film before. the director took out ALL the important parts of the book and left us with only the insignificant touchy romance...seriously the entire room was laughing every 5 seconds of the first half (by the second everybody was asleep)...nothing happened. we learned nothing about Tom Riddles history and the horocruxes (wasn't that the whole point of the story), important characters were missing (bill, fleur, charlie, dobby, kreacher, etc) and what was the whole part of the vanishing cabinet...the came into hogwarts and got out, no huge fights seen at the end which would have saved the entire movie had it been there."
852,8,Don't expect it to be the book... it's a nice watch!,"Obviously, we can't expect the movie to be like the book. After being somewhat disappointed the last 5 times, I went to see this movie not having read the book. And to say the least it was a pleasant surprise."
853,1,simply horrible,"this was the worst movie i have seen in years. the entire movie is setup with the most atrocious dialog. ""oh look here is (insert proper noun) it does this, and this, oh and i wonder if it will do that later in the movie."""
854,1,"What happened? It was really boring,",I had watched all the Harry Potter movies but never the books so I was watching it with no hangover.
855,6,Where was all the action?,"I went to go see this movie with very high expectations. I just finished reading the book 2 days before I saw the movie. And from the book I was expecting a movie that had a lot of suspense with an ending of total nonstop action. But instead I found a movie that tried way too hard to be funny left out many major key plot points that I have no idea how they will convey them in the seventh movies. One of my least favorite parts of the movie was that they rated it PG when the book could have been rated R if they made it into a movie. I think in order for it to be rated PG they had to take out the whole last scene of the fight in the school, which in my opinion was the best part of the book. The movie also didn't even mention the ministry of magic, which played a decent part in the sixth book. So overall they spent too much time trying to develop all of the characters relationships, and in turn left out a lot of action. Other than that it was a great movie, great cinematography, followed the plot fairly well, and explained a lot of what needed to be known for the seventh movies. The movies are what got me into reading the books, but this is the first movie where I would have much rather just read the book and gone without seeing the movie."
856,3,I'll just pretend this film wasn't made,"As a movie in its own right, its mediocre. If you have read the book, unless your memory is damaged or your sense of taste is alien, you can only agree with one fact: this was the worst HP movie script ever made."
857,8,"David Yates, Not again.",Harry potter previous movies are great and i used to watch them again and again but the 5th part is not so good due to bad directions.
858,2,Important Parts Or Not So Much?,"Was it just me or were some major parts with a LOT of importance left out of the movie when compared to the book? I mean I understand that it is almost impossible to include EVERYTHING in the book, but what about the major parts? Why leave those out? Am I mistaken when I say that Harry finding out that since Sirius died, Harry owns all his belongings, including Kreacher, is an important fact in the book? I mean, Kreacher is the one that helps Harry later on, why not add this? What about the whole Dumbledore joking around about Hogs Head and how he knows the bartenders? And why in the heck is Dumbeldore's wand just sitting on his desk after he dies? That is a HUGE part, later on, that it was laid to rest with Dumbledore. Speaking of, where was his funeral? It didn't have to be long, but him being laid to rest was a pretty siginificant part too. Some things didn't make sense either, for example: Snape being The Half Blood Prince. If you didn't read the book, there is NO explanation why he is The Half Blood Prince. And the whole fight and attack around/at the Weasley's house. Why was that in there? NOTHING came from that. And WHERE was the fight at the end? Was I the only one looking forward to that part of the movie? It never came. Like the Death Eaters could just stroll out of Hogwarts with no one to at least try to stop them, besides Harry. Little action, too much cut out (like more of the memories of Voldemort, including the one about how he came back to Hogwarts to be a teacher), it wasn't a HUGE mess, people that didn't read the book liked it, but they don't know everything they missed that could help set them up for understanding the events that happen in the next two films."
859,7,Good but disappointing,"Let me start by saying this book is my favorite so I had high expectations for the movie. Sadly I was disappointed that this movie seems to be the only movie that changed major plot lines for no apparent reason. I can't believe they made Ginny Harry's ""dirty little secret."" It takes away from the end when Haryr has to give Ginny up. The movie makes it into such a trivial encounter that no one who hasn't read the books will understand the passion that was there. Also I cannot understand what they were thinking when they decided to totally eliminate the battle at the end. It took away from Dumbledore's death. The Death-Eaters would not have wasted entering Hogwarts just to watch Snape kill Dumbledore, they would have made a big show of things, hence the battle."
860,8,"Great film, even though it isn't close to being a carbon copy of the book","Granted, no movie will ever be as rich in detail and in plot as a book is. However, this film is DEFINITELY the best one as far as Harry Potter goes. An avid HP fan, I've read each book no less than 10 times, and therefore it was easy to tell how the film deviated from the book. Many parts of the book were entirely take out, some of them vital to the story line. The beginning is completely different, and some scenes were entirely made up. The scenes that weren't from the book did actually help the movie, so I won't complain about them. I was looking forward to seeing how they did all the meetings between Dumbledore and Harry, and was extremely disappointed to see that not only do they meet twice to discuss Voldemort, but that only two of the memories Dumbledore shows Harry are seen. I believe the meetings between Dumbledore and Harry to be the backbone of the book, since that's where Harry learns not only what a Horcrux is but also finds out what are the ones Voldemort made (Hufflepuff's cup, Nagini, Ravenclaw's Diadem, Slytherin's Locket). Since this was omitted from the film, it's going to be very interesting to see how they incorporate it to the next one, being the Horcruxes what the seventh book is all about. The humor in this movie is great, as well as the special effects. The acting has also gotten much better when compared to the other films. What makes this movie great is that, although it didn't entirely follow the book, it was carried out extremely well, therefore making it a movie that's interesting not only for the HP fans, but for people who've never read the books of this fantastic world that is Harry Potter."
861,6,I'm not the right person for this.,"Let me begin with saying, I LOVE ALL THE HARRY POTTER MOVIES!"
862,2,A disappointment for the Harry Potter book lovers,"The special effects of this movie are good. VERY Hollywood. But why did the director tamper so badly with the wonderful universe created by Jo? 1.Why was Harry reading The Daily Prophet sitting in a Muggle restaurant? At the beginning of Half Blood Prince, Harry is recovering from the unbearable pain and grief caused by the death of his godfather, who was a father figure cum best friend to him. Then why oh why, did we have to watch Harry flirting with a restaurant waitress in a ""I-am-sixteen-with-raging-hormones-and-serious-need-of-dating"" way? This was just an example of how the characters have been made shallow. They do not follow Jo's wonderful original characters. 2.At last Luna and her father have got a supporter of their weired theories. The director of this movie actually SHOWS us wrakcspruts!!! 3.The Burrow was burnt down. It was being used as the headquarter of the Order, surely it should have had some strong protection? What purpose did this scene (which was not in the book) serve?And in the scene right after this,Ron and Ginny are acting all normal. 4.What about the battle at the end? 5.Where are the other memories which contain vital information about the Horcruxes? 6.WHERE IS THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN RON AND HERMIONE? Examples: Can you imagine Hermione herself telling Ron about snogging Krum, and then getting drunk? She tells Harry that she chose Mclaggen to annoy Ron, but he never seems to have known who her date was! This list will go on and on and on, so I stop here. I happened to enjoy this movie because - 1. I was sitting in an otherwise empty theatre with my boyfriend and we snogged whenever the movie got annoying. 2. I enjoyed the special effects."
863,4,HUGE Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, in them Rowling crafted a complete, complex, consistent magical world that readily captures the readers imagination and pulls the reader into her imaginative world and Harry's adventures. In the books, action proceeds logically (according to the rules of her magical world) and the characters are fully developed and fascinating."
864,4,Worst Movie in the Harry Potter Series,If I wasn't a Potter Fan .. I wouldn't have gave it a 4*.
865,6,Had bad felt for first time but Voldemort shines without appearing.,"Reviewing Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince in year of 2020 it's almost like 11 years after release this film. The story follows Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts as he receives a mysterious textbook, falls in love, and attempts to retrieve a memory that holds the key to Lord Voldemort's downfall. Not say bad film it's brings like we should study for exams before going to exam hall. That brings more deeper for Harry Potter knows more about Lord Voldemort. It's brings some factor such Harry Potter's in love between Ginny Weasley , Ron and Hermione questionable love factor, who is really the Half Blood Prince that Harry using in potion class , Dumbledore request with Potter to gain more information about Voldemort with new potion Professor Horace Slughorn who was close with Lord Voldemort in his school period and Professor is new dimension in this film by guiding Draco Malfoy. This brings how Harry's having impact with Half Blood Prince book, to find who is this and what is more information about Lord Voldemort with some love factor between the trio wizard."
866,2,Very Disappointing...... Wished it was Half as Good as the Novel,All I can say is that this film is not worth watching as it strays far from the lines of the book. Though the script quite often quotes the novel it does not follow the subject of the story and general plot. 
867,7,Em,"Knowing that hundreds of pages of books are difficult to adapt, but you can't lose the main story of the half-blood prince, and many details are not clear."
868,3,"what a disgrace to the ""Harry Potter"" name",This movie was a disgrace. I am shocked that they would display such horror on the big screen. I have seen better directing and story lines in middle school plays.
869,10,My love,The sixth part of the great non-child saga.
870,1,Wait for the DVD,"One of my favorite books reduced to a smarmy goofy back story. Seriously? Unfortunately, yes. As I walked out of the theater I couldn't believe what I had just seen. A movie that was so far from the book that it barely resembled the text from which it was adapted from. This series is titled Harry Potter and..... This movie was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. NOT Ron and Lavender and the Half Blood Prince!!! I can't even begin to imagine how they're going to recover from the eliminations of this movie not to mention the eliminations of past characters from other movies. Too bad, I really had hoped WB would redeem themselves after the fiasco of Phoenix and the selfish move to push back the release date of this movie. Wait until the DVD is released, then see it. Otherwise grab the book and enjoy a true masterpiece!!!"
871,7,Patience!,"My first impression was, is this really Harry potter and the Half blood prince? Where's all the missing pieces? I'm just hoping on one thing - that since there's the two part deathly hollows left, they'll have plenty to work with - like maybe a recount of a huge battle at Hogwarts between DA (Dumbledore's Army)and the Death Eaters on the day of Dumbledore's death and other missing pieces they completely left out!Maybe they deliberately did that so they can include it in the next one or at least deal with them in some way later in the two part of the Harry Potter Sequel Finale."
872,6,"The most crucial book, the worst adaption.","This movie started off where the fifth one left off. Oh, wait, no it did not. We saw Harry return to Hogwarts. Why start this film off with him back at the Ministry? Where was the important conversation Dumbledore had with the Dursleys in the book? That would have been a great way to start the movie off. And what was with the burrow attack scene? All in all, the movie was great. It made me laugh, gasp, and shed a tear. But compare it to the MOST IMPORTANT book, and it falls extremely short. The movie had so much romance and forced funny scenes, it soon became ridiculous. However, if you watch the movies only, then you will probably find this movie the best one yet. If you are a true Harry Potter fan, you will be outraged by the lack of information they set in the movie. It will be very hard for them to progress with the seventh one, since there are a lot of missing pieces that were set in play by the sixth book, which were left out of the movie. There are so many flaws and holes, I could write a book the size of The Half Blood Prince containing the mess ups. Way to screw up, yet again, Hollywood."
873,5,Not as good as it should have been,"The movie seemed half baked. The acting, the cinematography, the art direction, were all excellent, however the movie lacked a clear direction. Worse still, the antagonist for most of the movie is Draco Malfoy which is a bit of a downer when you had Voldemort before."
874,5,This movie is a cringe festival !,"It is a fun movie with lots of cringe moments that made me laugh so hard at one point. I think they were just trolling us very successfully. For example, I can't make any sense of the scene where Ginny tied Harry's shoes. Why there is a moment like that in this movie? Seriously, I got goosebumps in most of the scenes."
875,1,Not Boring but a lot of key points missing!,I saw harry potter last night i didn't think it was boring but a lot is missing.
876,10,my harry potter and the half blood prince review,"for some one who hasn't read the book but watch all the films i must say this is this best harry potter film yet much darker, much more humour and more insight into the world of harry potter."
877,8,Best Potter,"By far the best. Film feels very fleet footed and has a very nice way to connect the funny weired humor with a deeper darkness of the past and an even darker future, which is glooming at the horizon."
878,7,Not the best as expected...but Don't miss it .,"Movie begins with quite a pace when spooky death eaters rise from the hell and causes trouble around. It is going to be the sixth year of Harry and his pals in Hogwart and they have got some serious issues to settle down(AS AlWAYS).The quest of finding means to kill Voldermort continues and this time Harry has to befriend the new professor of potions Horace Slughorn to find out the secret oh his ex student ,Tom Riddle who is now known as Voldermort. Also he has to unveil the mystery of the book which has written on it ""This book belongs to THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE"". He is lead by his favorite Dumnbledore through various death defying twist and turns in and outside Hogwart. And this time he doesn't get the company of his friends who are more busy in their adolescent infatuation. The menacing presence of Lord Voldermort is absent this time which is a thing to be missed in the movie.Though the evil part is played by Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape. The U.S.P of the film is undoubtedly is its cinematography which is awesome.The actors truly justify the characters from the genius of J.K Rowling. This is not the best of the series but don't miss it ."
879,5,"Pity, disappointment for great expectations","I think I need to watch the movie again. I don't trust my first impressions, lately. My only sensation during the film was disappointment. Not only the awful adaptation, but also the imbalance as a film which could and should have been great. That makes me feel angry. I understand what a book adaption for a film is, and I value the effort made by filmmakers. It's been successful until now. This has been little awful."
880,5,Good set-up but not much else,"While this entry may not be as visually interesting and compelling as the some of the previous films, it still provides some pretty crucial set up for the big finale coming up."
881,6,"Exciting dark style, but lacking in variety and story","After being severely disappointed by the fifth movie in the series, the Order of the Phoenix, I can easily say that my expectations for this movie were very low. The third and fourth movie were by far the best in the series, and unfortunately this sequel could not meet those standards. However, after watching it, I was surprised by the way the movie was conducted. At most points in the movie it was very dark, but there were several funny moments that all types of audiences found humorous. The main objections I have with this movie was variety of the plot. I understand that every single element of the book cannot be incorporated into the movie, but there very important events from the book that were not even mentioned. First, the new minister of magic. I mean come on, not even a side comment about him? Or how about what happens to Bill Weasley? Doesn't he get attacked by the Greyback? I was expecting much more actions scenes from the Greyback, not just a couple posing scenes. As for the soundtrack, the same repetitive music from Order of the Phoenix was used, which was an annoying jolly tune that does not at all go with the entire movie, but the music was better for the more darker scenes. Also, there was too much emphasis between Slughorn and Harry. However, I was quite impressed by Daniel Radcliffe's acting, although his emotions could have been portrayed better as he got over tragedies too quickly. I strongly believe that David Yates is by far the weakest of the multiple directors of this best-selling series."
882,9,Very good,The best movie I've ever seen really I love it definitely deserves a better vote
883,4,Irony and Tragedy Of Half Blood Prince,"As an HP fan Im greatly disappointed, this is probably the worst interpretation of the whole series which for any true fan is tragic. But ironically for casual movie-goers or 'movies only' fans seem to have enjoyed the movie."
884,3,Trying hard to figure out what book this is based on,This film reminds me of the story about people writing serials who would leave the hero in a completely inescapable position because someone else was going to write the next chapter.
885,3,IMPORTANT STORYLINE LEFT OUT,"Ok. Yes.. I know, people who read the books always find the movies ""bad"". But here we have something else. All Voldemort's past is gone, and in HP#7-8 you can realize that there is no a sequence, i.e. 1. Suddenly we see Harry with a piece of mirror, which came from where?? How did Harry know about the other horcruxes? Ok in HP#7-8 we see that he can ""hear"" them, but why this didn't happen with tom's diary in HP#2. I 'm so sorry for this great book to become this bad movie!"
886,8,"Good movie, but did not follow the book!","This was by far my favorite book along with deathly hollows. Movie wise, this was a good movie. Love, comedy, and adventure. For the big fans of the books, sorry to disappoint you, but you will be disappointed. They left huge parts of the book out(the huge part in the end when the death eaters come to the school and there is a huge battle, not in it, along with other major parts). Now don't get me wrong, i loved the movie, my favorite out of the rest. It wasn't corny and stupid, it was solid. I just really wish they would've stuck to the roots of the book! I can only hope the next movie is more book orientated."
887,9,The Darkest Potter Yet.,"This is the darkest Harry Potter Film yet. There's a lot of evil in it...which I personally enjoyed very much. This is one of my favorite Harry Potter movies. The cinematography is fantastic, the plot is epic, and it keeps you interested. "
888,7,Good film,"Like the others, I think that this is a good film; however, like the others, you need the previous one to understand all the plot so it could not be considered a complete film. The main soundtrack is not as good as the first."
889,3,"HP and the Half Blood Prince, (not the book, just a crappy movie)","What can I say on behalf of this movie that let me down so hard and infuriated me so much? Slughorn was a good actor, Lavender was funny, and they finally got rid of the worst Dumbledore possible..... that's about it."
890,6,Not Good Not Bad,"When i finished the book, i was excited to see how the movie would turn out. The Book featured a lot of information critical for the next book, and well the movie seemed to forget some of it."
891,4,From bad to worse,"I find it hard to trust IMDb ratings nowadays. The only way for this movie to get almost 8 stars is to get a lot of reviews sponsored by the producers. And if you look at many positive reviews, they really look artificial, just like advertising."
892,5,"Good for Movie Goers, but a Disappointment to Book Readers.","However cinematic and thrilling this movie was... however many stunning special effects and great acting were employed... this movie left a viewer either very confused about the story, or very disappointed with the content. The storyline followed the book as loosely as the movie writers possibly could muster. in fact, the Half Blood Prince, which dominates so much of the story in the book, only appeared as a sub story in the movie. The Half-Blood Prince story went about something like this:"
893,3,Bad adaptation,"I agree that this was a horrible representation of the book. I felt like half of the story and characters were cut out (where has Dobby been, he plays an important role after all!!!??) and even changed (Ginny does not cry over boys, come on!! and since when does Dumbledore need to ask Harry permission for anything, it seemed like the two were more buddies than professor and student). The main problem I found though, was the lack of characterization of Voldemort- this is the whole point of this story!!!!!!!! Without knowing his character Harry can't kill him, come on Hollywood writers, get your heads out of you butts!!!"
894,5,Not nearly as good as the book...and MASSIVE plot holes.,"I thought the visuals and the mood of the film were fantastic. The filmmakers did a superb job re-creating the eeriness and darkness of the novel. Unfortunately, that's about ALL they captured of the book."
895,7,More suitable title would be The Awkward Adventures of Ron Weasley and the Snogfest from hell..,"The scene in the theater following my viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was like most of the other film's conclusions. People were clapping. However, I soon became aware that this was not a complementary applause but a condescending spattering of relief that the film was finally over. This became most apparent when someone said out loud, ""Yes, it's finally over!"" The sentiment was solidified when the exiting throng muttered their own forms of agreement to this statement. This was coming from a crowd whom one would believe to be the most avid Potter fans. A reasonably intellectual, slightly alternative group of adolescents and young adults who most likely read the entire series. Sadly to admit, my take was not far off from the pack. Please stop trying to reinvent the wheel."
896,10,"Not bad, but left us flat!","I am not a book purist, but I do feel the movie should at least try and keep the story on track."
897,5,Do not understand why Yates felt the need to rewrite the story,"While I understand that the director had a limited amount of time to try to fit in the details of the book, his interpretation of the film fell flat."
898,7,Excellent film,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince IS a good film. I went to see it last night and was hugely impressed with the acting, cinematography, lighting, close-ups and editing. It was interesting but not difficult to follow. I think it's a huge step up from the previous films, definitely catering for the older audience. But...I can understand where the fans of the book are coming from. I've been reading the books since I was eleven, and there are several seemingly important story lines missing, as well as the charm and humour brought by JK Rowling. I am also a film school student however, and understand that sometimes even major cuts are necessary to keep the film fast-paced and catering to a wider audience. I think David Yates finally found that balance in this film, and while I would have liked to have seen a little more action, the dramatic moments certainly make up for it and it's likely DH will be full of action anyway. Everyone will go and see Harry Potter regardless, simply because it's Harry Potter, 'loosley based' on the novel, but still great films."
899,7,"Eh, wish I'd gone to the matinée instead of paying full price :/","Once again, like so many other book-to-movie adaptations, this one feels a bit like a cliff notes version. I know, I know, you can't turn a book into a movie without leaving SOMETHING out. Books just have way too much information. However, the things that David Yates decided to leave out is virtually unforgivable, the supporting storyline came to the forefront way too often, and the things that never happened that were included, left me scratching my head. All I can say is Deathly Hallows had better be spot on, considering they get two movies to do it in."
900,2,this movie emptied the book from any meaning,"I've waited a while for this movie, and like most, I've seen two trailers. The first one was focusing on Voldemord and let me foresee a movie focusing on the genesis of the dark lord. It felt quite exciting and chilling. The second one seemed more spectacular, but composed of ill-assorted bits of intrigue, and suggested chaotic writing and an obvious lack of purpose. After watching both, one after the other, I felt rather confused about what to expect from this movie... It was either bound to be brilliant or messy. Too bad, this movie is awfully messy."
901,6,"Artistic masterpiece, but wrong atmosphere","I'm a reader of the books so this might be a tad biased. I enjoyed the movie very much. It seemed more mature than the other movies in way, just the visual effects and stuff. Artistically speaking this movie was beautiful. My favorite scene was a panned view from outside the castle. It went from Hermione and Harry sadly sitting downstairs, a moved to show Ron running upstairs with his girl friend and then zoomed out to show Draco on a balcony staring over the school grounds. It was perfect; the lighting, the way the feelings of the characters were displayed and it all just fit in wonderfully. Besides a few scenes like that though, I found it had the wrong atmosphere. All of Hogwarts now knew that Voldemort was back and killing yet there was so much joking around, it didn't give the movie the seriousness that it deserved. I felt like they were making it into a joke, and that would have been find if it was any other movie but the Half-Blood Prince. The flashbacks were filmed and acted quite well. I must say I really liked Tom Felton as he acted Malfoy. This movie was more centered around Draco and Tom Felton did a terrific job of depicting the character; he was very creepy. When Harry and Dumbledore were in the cave the inferni (dead people) came out of the water I liked how the inferni looked and how it gave that ""jumping"" feeling. I found that after Dumbledore's death, the funeral and everything was much too rushed to be sad and that the movie failed to depict the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore so that when Dumbledore died and Harry was all sad, anyone who didn't read the book was left think ""Okay, why is he so sad? He barely knew the guy..."" To abbreviate I liked the movie's filming but it wasn't all that well paced near the end and I found the atmosphere wrong for the story so because of it's flaws I'm only giving it a 7/10."
902,5,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Good special affects but Disappointing Harry Potter Movie,"Up until now the Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite Harry Potter Movie this one has now taken that position. I know it is difficult to compress a large book into the time frame of a movie deciding what to leave out and how to close the plot holes created. This one however deviates further from the book than its predecessors it not only leaves a lot out as expected, it has added scenes that are not in the book and appear to have been included only to enhance the 3D effects in the cinema, make things difficult for the next director to stick to the original story line (e.g. The sequences at the borough) or like the scene in the railway café for no logical purpose; and is out of character with the book. Each new director has understandably put his own stile on the movie, but at some point I ask is this a continuing story following the lives and adventures of a group of teenage wizards over a seven year period, in which case there should be some consistency and continuity throughout the series, if so Hogwarts and locations and objects within it should not change from movie to movie. If on the other hand the movies are not meant to be a continuing story but separate adventures that just have the same character's then this movie OK, but there were so many inconsistence's and contradictions to the books and the other movies that I found it very jarring to watch as part of the Harry Potter series and as such was disappointing."
903,8,"Very good, Yates' finest","Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black. One of the many things i love about this film, is its ability to be a comedy film, with many laughable moments and also a dark, gritty stage of the series. One of the reasons it works so much is Delbonnel- the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. So many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. The cinematography is excellent, blocking is used superbly and the close-ups are astonishingly good. The acting is superb as usual, but it's Jim Broadbent as Slughorn who steals the show. This one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no long winded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skilfully guiding us through. To me, this is the most memorable film in the series, and one of the best, with one of the strongest plots."
904,3,The book - great steak -- the movie - not even hamburger,"I agree with the other parties comments on this specific movie. Half-Blood Prince was extremely chopped up, jumped around scenes too quickly, and was too focused on romance. I've read and listened to the unabridged audio book of HP #6, and there was not enough information in so many of the scenes to make heads or tails of things. Granted the movie was about 2 1/2 hours long, it could have stood for some axing of the romance, or putting in another 15-30 minutes of scene filler to give more definition of what was going on. I tried to take it in the view of a person who had never heard or read the series, and I think that person would have thought the director had a channel changer remote control mentality or some sort of attention deficit disorder. The Order of the Phoenix movie suffered some of that as well, but seemed to have a better following story line than this one. And with Deathly Hallows being a two-parter, I hope the story line is not so chopped up."
905,6,"Just as a movie, Weakest of the Entire Series","As someone who is vaguely familiar with the books, and an admirer of the movies this was a major disappointment. Not saying that the movie is bad by any means but this is a case where the movie really crumbles under the weight of adaptation. Not everything written in books is translated well to film. And it feels like a lot of details that should be included are not and things that shouldn't be included are.<br /><br />A pretty huge chunk of the movie feels like a series of disconnected scenes that you could change the order to and it wouldn't make any difference. Plus a huge setback is no narrative thrust, there is no goal that we are supposed to care about.<br /><br />But on the upside, the last 40 minutes is one the best climaxes in history. That is what elevates the movie and increases rewatchability."
906,1,Terrible!!!,I was so disappointed in this film. I counted down the days until it's release and went to see it on opening day. What a waste of time and money.
907,8,What's the big deal?,"Personally, I don't get why everyone is calling this movie such a failure."
908,10,Best One In The Series,"OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG Harry potter and the half blood prince is one of the best harry potter movies in the entire series, this movie has such a great story with great casting and suspense, this has a great ending but I'm not going to spoil it but let's just say that the movie has a Sad Sad ending The Cast Daniel Radcliffe is just the beginning of the awesome cake, his supporting cast Emma Watson and Rupert grint are great as harry's best friends, Alan rickman plays the teacher Snape. HUGE SHOCK AT THE END OF THE MOVIE The Story This movie has a great and intriguing story that has you being pulled in for the entire thrill ride that never lets go of you when you're on the ride, if you have read the books this will be a great movie The Action Sequences Don't get all fanboy on me, i love this movie to the heavens but the one problem with this movie is that there is not many action sequences but when there is action, it is so intense you feel like you are harry potter Verdict On my scale of 1 out of 10, i am not surprised with the rating that I'm going to give it, 10 out of 10 this is a epic masterpiece of cinema that you must see on the big screen, it won't have the same feel on DVD"
909,1,What the F**k,"Now how the bloody hell do you rate this movie this high?! This is a true insult to both great and horrible movies... Have any of you read the book? I had more trouble finding accurate events from the book then Hollywood sh*t, I used all my energy and manage to watch 26 minutes of this movie and it is truly the worst case of piece by piece destruction of a great story and I hate it with all the pieces of my now bleeding heart. J.K. created a masterpiece and then sold everything down the drain for money, I will try to remember the books as they were and the characters as they were described, I hope you will too. Read the book or if you are lazy listen to the audio book. This doesn't deserve a place in the junk next to my child's diapers, instead it should be shoved up Adolf Hitler's a*s and remain there for all time."
910,,depressed cast !,"I'm so disappointed with this movie. I agree with all the other comments regarding the movie being a very poor adaptation of the book and key elements missing, but has any one else noticed how depressed and apathetic the cast seem. Daniel Radcliff appears as though he just can't be bothered to put any effort into his character. It also appeared that the 'absolutely fantastic' Alan Rickman struggled to utter the simplest lines. My daughter remarked on the way out of the theatre that it seemed as if the whole cast had been involved in major arguments and fall outs and was finding it difficult working together. There was none of the chemistry between characters which made the earlier movies so electric. In the book Ginny Weasley's character comes across as feisty and strong, in one chapter she is likened to her mother 'molly' in the movie Ginny appears aloof and distant. The developing bond between Harry and Ginny is hardly depicted and what reference they do reveal to their blossoming love falls flat as there is absolutely no depth in the acting between the two characters. We watched the movie in a packed theatre. Before the credits began to roll people where getting up and exiting the screen. If you have read the books and know the characters well you couldn't possibly enjoy this movie. We are so disheartened and sad, we shall not be bothering with the final movie 'Deathly Hallows' It's just to painful to witness such wonderful actors and the genius of JKR's work rendered into such rubbish."
911,5,Ehh... it could have been better.,"I will start with something positive. The acting was definitely first class and the spats of hormonal humor was funny, and reminisce to the earlier years at Hogwarts. "
912,7,"High school movie, with a little Harry Potter mixed in","Now don't get me wrong, I did like the movie a lot. However, I think their focus was on romance too much and not on what really matters in the big picture."
913,1,worst ever,"I have finally seen the new film and I have renamed it Harry Potter and make it up as we go along. I didn't go and see it at the cinema, as I heard bad things before it's release. My kids went and my daughter told me it was bad. Just to make things clear, I am a huge fan and have read all the books more than once. I finally saw it and was horrified. The only two things that were even close to the book, were Slugthorne and Katie Price. I understand that things do get changed, but this was completely re-written. I'm presuming that Harry has moved to London, as there are no train subways in Surrey. Where on earth did you get that Harry loved riding trains. Blowing up The Burrow, was so wrong and so pointless. Nothing was anywhere near. How can that mess of a story carry on into the next films. I am presuming that you haven't read the books and therefore don't have a clue what your doing. I will not be buying it and I will not go and see the last two. It has been completely spoiled and I have never been so disappointed and angry in my life. The end was so bad. I and others have felt betrayed. Personally I think it should be trashed and start again with someone who knows what they are doing."
914,8,Think of it as a first part of a trilogy,"You gotta think of this as a first part of a trilogy. Things are starting to get to the final conclusion of the story. If you've read the final book, you enjoy the movie better knowing what is coming in the final two movies. If you haven't you feel like there is so much left out, but it's all in the final book. I do think that instead of the attack on the burrow, they could've had the attack on hogwarts giving some more time to Neville and Luna and what they end up doing in the final book, particularly Neville. One more very important thing they leave out, is one very important memory that gives Harry the clue to finding the final horcruxes in the last book, this was taken out and is very important to what they do in the future. Also, the kiss was totally lame. Harry was the one supposed to take initiative, not Ginny. Anyway, if you haven't read the last book, don't worry, everything SHOULD be explained in the final two films, so think of it as a first part of a trilogy and you might enjoy the movie more. If you read the final book after watching the movie, things will make sense."
915,7,Disappointed Fan,"The thing is, I really love harry potter. I had a total marathon of the past movies counting up the days until the movie came out. So, I really disappointed in the fact that the left out such crucial details of the Dark Lord's life. After watching the movie you would think that he's just a man who wants to be immortal not the truth behind him. Everything from hating his father and mother is completely left out. We got no good insight as to what happened so them. Even the ring, that was shown but not really explained. Furthermore the characters relationships were not built on more. The way that Snape and Dumbledore interacted in the book was more in-depth. The emphasis on the way that Dumbledore put all his trust into to Snape was shown. In the novel it was so clear absolutely how much that he trusted Snape it was crazy. After reading the 6th one, and the death of Dumbledore, I felt like he was such a old fool. But in the movie I got none of that sensation. Even the ending...where was the feeling, the passion, the feeling of doom and solemn that was about to take over them. I totally did not appreciate the whole line about Ron not caring that he was with Ginny. It was random it did not fit right there. Dumbledore has JUST DIED. Whats going on...No offense but the screen play writers tore up the book. I feel that the movie totally did not convey anything that was going on."
916,10,I was numb throughout the adventure!!!!!!!!,"As always I'll start with what I didn't like here. The pure exclusion of Marvolo, Merope and Morfin. I was particularly excited about the scene where Harry gets a glimpse of Hufflepuff's Cup but that didn't happen. Ralph Fiennes'es superb acting could've been exhibition-ed more if they had shown that exchange about a job b/w him and Dumbeldore. and then the absence of Ravenclaw's diadem in the movie."
917,8,meh T_T,"For someone who has read the book, I was kind of disappointed. Of course, in my opinion, the books are always better than the movies. I think that's unavoidable, because in the books you can read how harry was feeling, understand it better and so on. However; as a disappointed fan of twilight, I kind of saw it coming- that the movie would be less thrilling than the trailer. Don't get me wrong, the movie was amazing. Its just, I expected better. I think they should have stuck to the book a tiny bit more. I mean, they could have added the part where the gryffindors win the cup and Ginny and harry kiss there. They could have added more dialogue in the scenes with harry and dumbledore- this was the most disappointing, I expected the relationship to grow more than they showed. My favourite scenes, however, were- one, when Hermione was crying and harry was literally her shoulder to cry on. Two, when harry drank Felix felicis and saw slughorn in the greenhouse. Three, when the bridge was falling- amazing effects. Finally, when harry was being dragged down the lake."
918,1,Shockingly bad adaptation of a great book,"Wow, that was truly awful."
919,7,Great Build Up To the Final 2 Part Movie.,"Goods: Funny, Looks GREAT, Sad, Dark, Mature, Better Acting! "
920,,Garbage,"It's been more than two years since I saw this film, and I am still disgusted with this pile of garbage. Now that I am reading the novels for the third go-round, I felt compelled to do what I can to voice my intense displeasure with this movie. Some of the reviews on here - the glowing 10-star gushfests - really?"
921,6,"Watch the Film before reading the Book, else you will be disappointed","Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint Harry's 6th year at Hogwarts. Dumbledor (Gambon) persuades Slughorn (Broadbent) back from retirement so Harry can find out a memory that will unlock the secret into beating Voldemort."
922,8,"Really Good Movie! If you haven't read the books, wait until the movies are finished though","The Harry Potter movies towed the line of the book for the first 3 films and then from there, as the size of the books increased the less the feature length adaptations resembled the source material. This unavoidably is a disappointment to anyone who has read the novels beforehand, because the books are so intricate, well thought out and well written. That being said, this movie continues in that direction by abandoning J.K.R.'s weave of subplot and distilling the book into a PG- rated teaser trailer of the book. "
923,8,"A great movie, as Harry Potter films go","Although I have read many of the comments and sense that the general feeling towards this movie is disappointment, I must say that I have to disagree. As an avid reader of the books, having read them all at least three times, I feel that I go into these movies with extremely high expectations. However, this was the movie I was most impressed with in the series. I may have become desensitized to the normally horrifying book-turned-movie process, but I feel like Yates hit the mark this time. All of the essential parts of the book are there, with much added entertainment that was a pleasant instead of discouraging surprise. About 80% of the movie is verbatim from the book, exactly how I pictured it, and for that I am grateful, having sat through Harry Potter films that seemed to be about 50% Rowling and 50% Hollywood."
924,8,Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,"PG(Some Violence, Supernatural Themes|153MINS|Adventure, Family, Fantasy Users need to know that this installment continues the series dark tone, and the fantasy sequences are more intense. For young viewers, the death of a beloved character can be extremely upsetting. Other characters are injured, kicked and cursed in frightening ways, and a very intense climatic scene involving frightening, demon-like creatures is guaranteed to frighten young children. There are also some upsetting scenes and violent attacks. Some of the students are almost adults (16 years old), so there is a few romantic moments between boys and girls, but kissing and hand-holding is as far as it goes. Though Harry and the main characters continue as positive role models, characters continue their evil plans. There are also a few scenes featuring alcohol consumption, and a professor serves teenagers with it."
925,8,Good addition to the series,I went into this movie expecting not to like it because of all the talk of what they cut out of the novel. I was wrong.
926,9,An adaptation that captures the spirit and charm of the book well,"It's witty, yet still dark. While it does have to leave parts of the book behind, it captures the essence that made this book great. While Order of the Phoenix has some kinda lazy VFX, I felt this movie did an excellent job utilizing the effects in new ways. Tom Felton and Michael Gambon make incredibly standout performances here. "
927,4,For Fans of the Books a Major Disappointment,"Before you read this you should know I love Harry Potter. The message of the series and the characters have been a part of my life since I was ten years old. I grew up with Harry, Herminone and Ron. That is why I feel an obligation to warn fans of this brilliantly written piece of literature. Prepare yourselves! I am not by any means saying that the film is a complete wash but if you, like me, love the book brace yourselves for an utter let down."
928,5,The Half-Crap Prince,"Being a fan of Harry Potter films and books, I was very disappointed in this. The performances were good, but some of the characters were left out. They completely forgot about Harry's other flame from ""The Order of the Phoenix"", Cho Chang, and a lot of other characters. I was beginning to like Neville in the last film, but in this one he doesn't say a word. "
929,8,"For an adaptation of a 650 page 6th of 7 book, it'll do","First - not a raving Harry Potter fan. I don't find JK Rowling's writing style timeless or overly literary, but she spun a great story using great imagery and created characters you cared about. I consider the books entertaining and well-crafted, but I'm not a rabid HP fan."
930,7,Note quite a 10 .... SPOILERS,"Other folks have made many comments already with which I agree, so I would like to restrict myself here to a few things that really bothered me, and kept me from giving this film a higher score. "
931,3,Bitterly Disappointed,I went to watch this movie on opening night with high hopes. The series had been building wonderfully up until now. So what went wrong?? I get that films have to cut out a quite a bit of the book as otherwise they would be too long. However why oh why did they add bits that did not belong. For example the attack on the Weasley house. Was that needed? No. However it wasted time that could have been used on other things.
932,4,Disappointment to Readers of HBP,"I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince on a Thursday afternoon. After watching the film, I'm glad I did not attend a midnight showing, for I would have had to bear witness to the stunned reactions of fans to what should have been a thoroughly absorbing film."
933,1,"Man... If I Wasn't Such A Harry Potter Fan, I Don't Think I Would See the Next Movie...","Okay, so I was going to see the most recent addition to the HP movie collection, and I thought, ""Why don't I check out IMDb?"" So I looked at the comments posted and I thought, ""Man, some of these people really hate this movie, what complainers!"" But I went to see it anyway. And you know something, those complainers are all right! The worst installment of the HP movie series so far (and I thought OOTP was bad). It turned a truly amazing book into some sort of Twilight remake, but with a different story line! The comments that rate this movie TEN STARS have obviously never read the books. If I didn't love the HP series so much, I probably wouldn't even see the seventh movie. But I love the books so much, I feel compelled to go see and own all of the movies. Those of you who have read and love the books, if you don't feel obligated to go see the movies, then don't see them."
934,1,book 6 vs the Draco Malfoy Movie,Please tell me that this director is NOT the director of the next 1 and 1/2 movies.
935,5,Disappointing,"It is possible that being the 6th movie in the series it is unreasonable to expect a lasting impression. But I think the movie has been very sloppily made - the dialogs poorly written, the narration badly organized, the ending too abrupt (even though I concede it has to follow the book). While i did not get bored (the game of 'quidditch' alone as usual makes it worth watching), I felt the movie left a lot to be desired. I have not read the book but the plot seems very weak. I hope the last part is being made with more care and less hurry. Given people's expectations and the sure money earner that it is, why cant the movie director be more thoughtful in his presentation and not give it a 'commoditized' feel."
936,6,SPOILER ALERT,"Gandalf dies! Not too bad, managed to stay awake to this one!"
937,2,Worst Potter movie ever. Why did they do that?,"To keep it short: I did NOT read the book. This movie does NOT have a story and it does NOT explain anything that happens within it. The Half-Blood-Prince is mentioned. Fine. But never explain WHAT exactly that is, or even why it should be important."
938,5,"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.","I liked the book, and in fact, the book was not meant to be a movie. This one was more of a talking book that had plot. This adaptation left me looking at the floor. During the middle of it, i found a piece of popcorn more interesting. But it got better as it went on. The acting was phenomenal. Michael Gambon gave the performance of his life. The only character I dding'tbelieve was ginny. This was a good movie if you hadn't read the book, and it would've been good if it dding't have a middle. somewhat disappointing, but somewhat pleasant. It's not the best potter movie, but it's not the worst. That title still belongs to order of the phoenix"
939,9,Almost Perfect,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is in my opinion the best movie of the series so far (yes, I think it's better than Deathly Hallows; Part 1). And yet I was very disappointed when first watching it. Basicaly I missed just two things: A – there could show more Harry's brilliance at potions classes (although the one scene that did show it was really good) and B – the memories regarding Tom Riddle; the one at the Gaunts, the one at Hepzibah Smith and the one with Voldemort and his uncle Morfin. I feel those memories are crucial to the story (ironicaly Dumbledore said something very similar) and would also be really interesting. This is in fact the one thing that's keeping this movie from being the best one of the series. I was hoping they included those scenes in the Extended Edition and I was disappointed again when I realized they didn't. I find it perfectly logical that not all scenes from the book can be in the movie. Those of you who are making lists of what was in the book but wasn't in the movie are a little bit, forgive me, ignorant. It's quite obvious that not ALL scenes can be in the movie. In fact of course lots of them can't and won't be. Where you do get confused is when they make scenes that not only weren't in the book but are completely irrelevant to the story. Nevertheless this movie NEEDS to be watched. "
940,3,I disagree,"I think that David Yates did a terrible job of adaptation. I couldn't believe that he changed the fight sequence in the end. When I was reading about the death eaters fighting the students in Hogwarts, I could imagine the scene so vividly and I thought that it would be the best Harry Potter film yet. I was sadly disappointed with the directors choice to accentuate the love stories in all their lives and leave out the juicy details that dealt with the main plot of all the books. I mean, why even show the magic cabinet? The death eaters came through and then ran away from Hogwarts after doing very minimal damage. They never had to use the thing according to the movie and therefore it was pointless to have it in. This was just one of the many sequences that was sadly unnecessary,(even though it should have been) in telling the story. I felt like I had missed something grand in the movie. Especially after the crappy mourning process that was supposed to take place of a grand funeral. I hope that the seventh movie can redeem this awful piece of trash. "
941,8,Good Movie,"Would have been great if it had been six hours long so they could have included everything. Movie makers had to cater to the book fans and movie fans. I think they had a good balance. Great books don't always make great movies due to time constraints and what makes a great book doesn't make a great movie. Many of the good parts left out of the book simply wouldn't have made the movie much better. Overall, yes there was room for improvement, but I'm not sure what they could have taken out to fit more in. Taking out some of the romance stuff might have made it more faithful to the book but I'm not sure that it would have improved the movie. I think I'll re-read the book, I'm sure it will be even better now."
942,1,COmplete Disappointment For the fans unlike previous movies,"All the comments before mine are showing the fact.The movie was a disaster for all the fans. I personally haven't read any book, but after this movie i will in order to calm my nerves.But i liked all the previous movies.This one hurt my feelings.I went out of the cinema with my tears ready to drop wondering how could they possibly do that to us? how could they shoot such an awful movie.It lasts 2.30 hours 1.30 of which is about Ron and his sexual games.There are silly jokes,i thought i was watching American Pie or something.The movie leaves you with a feeling of disappointment and emptiness.I hope that i have time to read the book soon because i was really hurt at my feelings.Could somehow all our complaints be read from the producers or whatever JK Rowling,Yates and whoever other is responsible for that mess?I wish so... 1/10 because there is no 0 or negatives (-)"
943,9,One of the better Potters!,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a good film, but suffers from the problem the other Potters have: it just can't strike the same chord as the books, especially the conclusion which, while thematically faithful to the book, didn't feel as emotional on the screen."
944,5,Easily the worst in the series,"Although I have a passion for fantasy, I never read the books about Harry Potter. The movies however I've seen several times each, and I enjoy them all."
945,3,Very Disappointing...,"As a person who read the books, I was incredibly disappointed in this film. Although I did think the acting and overall production value of this film was top notch, the writer who adapted Ms. Rowling's book should be struck with the Cruciatus curse! Instead of focusing on the story arc of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort, he decided to spend his 2.5 hrs. focusing on Harry and Friends' ""coming of age"". i.e., he chose to focus on who was hooking up with who. (Kinda like Harry Potter: High School Musical Edition...). Although this was in the book, the primary focus was on Harry discovering Tom Riddle's history, the discovery of the Horcruxes and the assault on Hogwart's by the Death Eaters resulting in Dumbledore's murder. None of these things were properly represented in the film, with the exception of Dumbledore's death."
946,6,"Enjoyed, but could have been better",Movies never did justice to the books. There were many details that could have been added. But what bothered me the most is that they failed to show the beautiful relation Dumbledore and Harry shared. Their relation was merely reduced to that of Teacher and Student. And this happened the most in the Order of Phoenix and Half Blood Prince. HP movies were one of my favourite movie series but after reading the books I just could not watch the movies without complaining in every next scene.
947,1,So uninspired and raw,"Unlike the earlier movies, this movie is boring, no songs. It is so raw and i dont think this movie should be like some teenager movies. 7 and 8th movies are like that too. I do not reccomend this movie to anyone who likes actions. This was such a raw movie and i skipped a lot of minutes (Around 20) watching it. I really like book of the movie but after this movie i couldn't enjoy my book. I thought the movie would be very.... idk what to say. I thought the movie would be like the 5th film. Exciting soundtrack, interesting plot and players playing their role very well. There is absolutely NOTHING in this movie. My review of the movie is also the same as 7th and 8th film. If you are a fan of Harry, i can't stop you from watching the film but this film ruined my whole Harry Potter love."
948,5,To all the raving fans!!!...This is the worst of all!!!,Yet another disaster attempt !!! I seriously think Yates&co failed miserably in understanding key plot of the book and having read all the earlier comments from all the users i don't quiet understand how some really feel this movie is so good and convincing.
949,4,fans will be disappointed,"i am not a harry potter fan, but i really like the series, iv'e read every book and i find them pretty good. i have watched the other 5 movies too, and i always find something that i dislike, whether it is poor acting, bad casting or parts from the books that get chunked out. i had my expectations high for this one. i saw the trailer, and i thought ""oh, finally, a true harry potter film!""... i was terribly wrong."
950,2,Don't waste your time,"I usually don't get too worked up over movies that are bad adaptations of a book, but this movie was so awful I felt the need to register an account a tell everyone not to waste their time."
951,4,Harry Potter minus angst,"For a story which gets progressively darker, the movies seem to get quite lighter. It' got a healthy dose of romance, awesome graphics, funny dialog and decent acting. But it really lacks the angst which really characterizes Potter. I admit that too much of angst is one of the pitfalls of Harry's character. But Harry Potter as a boyscout hero does not work for me. That's Ron's job, which he does rather well both in the book and movies."
952,5,What book was this again?,You may find yourself wondering that very thing if you watch this movie and are a fan of the book series.
953,9,Loved it! Definitely the best HP movie so far!,"Personally, I absolutely LOVED this movie and it is definitely the one that follows the book story the most."
954,9,A Worthy adaptation and portrayal,"With the last two installments the harry potter franchise has lived up to the ingenious storytelling genius of J.K.Rowling. The half blood prince has an added flavor of humor to it which was the only characteristic missing from Rowling's novels. A brilliant adaptation of the book adds some scenes and deletes some of them but still does justice to the plot. The effects are awesome and though the ending lacked in intensity compared to the order of phoenix, there isn't a dull moment in this 2 nd half hour long movie. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape easily steals the show with other actors portraying their characters with equal finesse. A Must watch for everyone. Highly recommended"
955,8,"Yet another great movie in the series, if not the best.","I went to this movie with no expectations whatsoever, but even if had high ones, I'm certain they would've been fulfilled."
956,3,Worst Harry Potter film by far.,"As a massive fan of the Harry Potter books, and films alike, I was really looking forward to seeing the Half Blood Prince. As one of millions of people who love the books I was expecting something at least on par with the previous films. I was bored and confused as I watched my favourite book be badly directed, badly written and cringing at times."
957,7,Not The Potter We Expected,"I can't take the real taste of magical Rowling style until The Goblet of Fire. That means i think David Yates isn't a right choice for the Harry Potter series. I don't surely know he is a good director maybe. Because in some thriller scenes it seems nice. It takes you in movie. But there are no solid connections between scenes in this movie. Seems like funny, thrilled and romantic scenes shown orderly. In funny scenes it seems adequate. They make you laugh really. You can't see much romantic scenes but it's OK. Thriller scenes are good. You feel the tension when you're watching. But something is missing. Something that original book or first two movies have is not in this movie. You can't go with it and forget the clock. You always watch because you wonder what is different from book. Also as the other fans said very important scenes deleted when filming. I think Chris Columbus or Mike Newell were good choices for Harry Potter but not sure about Yates. Watch this if you wonder but don't expect much..."
958,3,One of the worst films ever considering the story from which it was created,Before dismissing my conclusion please read the review. There are three aspects we should consider when talking about this film. 1. How good it is a film by itself.
959,4,Worst movie in the series... so far,"Being an avid fan of the Harry Potter books, I have made sure to see all of the movies, and, as with any movie based on a book, can accept that the movies do and sometimes must deviate from the original text. With that said, the deviations presented in this film are beyond my ability to forgive. I honestly must ask why J.K. Rowling allowed this to be released; this is not the longest of the movies, and with so much covered in the sixth book, it could have used to be 30 minutes longer."
960,6,I'm a huge fan of the books and i was not happy,"i have to say that for someone who has not read the books, like many of the movie critics who have written reviews on this movie, it is a very good movie. for someone such as myself, i would have to say that i was quite disappointed that there was not battle scene at the end. the book is filled with intense dialogs of tom riddle and the questionable half-blood prince which all lead up to this awesome and absolute thrilling battle scene between the order of the phoenix and the death eaters. i did not understand why it was left out of the movie. i was absolutely shocked when i saw that snape led the death eaters out of howgarts without even a struggle, except for the couple of spells cast by harry, followed by a ""i am the half-blood prince"" by Snape which seemed to have been put in there for the sake of the title. i feel as though they replacement this, what was supposed to be a gripping scene, with burrow catching on fire and harry and Ginny running through the field. the burrow is not once set on fire throughout the series, in fact, there was supposed to be Charlie's and Fleur's (two characters who were missing in the movie as wheel) wedding in book 7. although it was an interesting scene, it begs the question on why Greyback and lestrange did so if they didn't even attempt to capture harry and kill Ginny. the other very important detail i am very disappointed in not seeing in the movie is the fact that Dumbledore did not explain how and why Voldemort chooses the objects he does to use as horcruxes and why the locket would be in that specific cave. the fact that they showed a picture of the cave in tom riddle's room is simply not a good enough explanation. Grawp's memory is not even in the movie and that is a crucial detail in how and why voldemort's horcruxes symbolically represent Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. is it with this knowledge that Dumbledore left harry with that harry succeeds in finding and destroying the other horcruxes. this ties in the fact that harry, in the book, hides his potions book near a gargoyle in which he places a tiara on its head, a tiara in which he only realizes in the 7th book that it is Ravenclaw's tiara and of course another Horcrux. as a reader, i am very disappointed about these crucial details that were left out. i'm wondering how they are going to succeed in making the 7th book leaving so much out of the 6th movie. i believe that all this could have possible incorporate in the movie if it was not so concentrated with love triangles. j.k. rowling's half-blood prince is magnificent, detailed, and perfect, and i do not believe that movie did it all justice."
961,4,"Should be titled ""Harry Potter and The Warner Brothers Licence to Print Money""","Dear oh dear oh dear. Haven't the bean counters at Warner Bros yet realised that HP fans WILL come and see the films no matter what? If they haven't then they should check the box office receipts. If they have, then why ""... in the name of Merlin's pants ..."" can't they get a decent script writer and a not-full-of-himself director to make a faithful visual representation of at least one HP book? There are lots of comments supporting this film as a good version of the book. To all of you who feel this way, please stop short changing yourselves and go back and read the book again (this time pay attention). There are so many inaccuracies - the film starts with one on the London Underground for instance and where David Yates got the idea for blowing up The Burrow is beyond me. I still don't know why the idea of Death Eaters being able to fly without broomsticks was ever allowed, seeing as how it is a major Voldemort only development in book seven! And as for the way Snape kills Dumbledore (good riddance to Michael Gambon I say) its an absolute joke. Plus, no funeral. Yea Gods what was everyone thinking about? Again so much story, particularly the back story about Riddle's upbringing is skated over. Yes the film is darker, even #5 HP & OOP is darker. But you have to be darker in the right way. You need to take time to build up the story to create the darkness, not simply lower the lights on set."
962,10,Always something mew,My wife and I watch Harry Potter series once or twice yearly. We're still finding new details every time. I really enjoy the story.
963,9,"Excellent, really excellent.",SPOILERS!!!! SPOILERS!!!
964,8,Simply Confused,"This movie was excellent. The acting, cinematography, special effects, and the pacing were great. As in any novel adaptation though, far too much was left out for my tastes."
965,5,Ho Hum,"A very disappointing movie. Slow and tedious at times, I found myself checking my watch every fifteen or twenty minutes. Scenes did not flow and were not always relevant to the plot. Seems like the magic is gone from Harry Potter movies. Where were the moving staircases? Where were Nearly Headless Nick and Moaning Myrtle? Crabb, Goyle, and Nevile Longbottom ? Sure the movie advanced the overall Potter plot and helps set up finale. But it seemed to be a bunch of individual scenes loosely connected. It was great to find the primary cast intact, but as noted above some important characters were missing. A weak effort. I've read all the books and this movie is the first one that didn't follow the book very well at all."
966,10,best movie,I'm sorry but this is simply the best Harry Potter movie. I can't lie to you when dumbudor dies I cried everytime
967,6,a missed adaptation,disclaimer: not a fan of the books although this was the one i enjoyed the most - plus the adventure of seeing it at midnight with my wife and son made the experience fun.
968,5,Why did Yates and company burn down the Burrows?,"It is my understanding that HP 6 was in the can before Yates and company decided to split the 7th book into two parts, making two movies, choosing to allocate more time to cover the events leading up to Rowling's grand finale."
969,2,The worst film about Garry Potter,"I'm a fan of GP, but this film is the worst. Explaine why. The first is to admit that during the film there were only dark colors without any bright thing. I know that the 6th book isn't such fairy tail like the 1st, but it's a movie of high quality but not like in TS. Most of all episodes outdoors weren't panoramic like in other films. And territory around castle and Weastly's house was not the same like it was previous. About actors. Play of Ginny was the worst comparing with the 2d film. And also I don't like that half of plot in this movie was changed especially 2 last episodes (in cave and Dambldor's death). I don't think that it was to hard to do all like in book. And where is Dambldor funeral? I don't want Yats to make a movie!! He is untalented producer!"
970,8,"The beginning of the end it's Darker,Deeper and Better !!!","I have always been a fan of harry potter books,but to be honest the first 4 movies of harry potter were great disappointment to the book fans and not that interesting to stand alone as a movie to appeal to a regular cinema enthusiast."
971,9,fun summer movie,"I am a die hard harry potter fan as most of you on this site are, and these movies are great. Everyone is going through them with a fine tooth comb looking for it to be exactly like the book when with the allotted time it cannot be done. When you go into the Harry Potter movies you must realize how difficult, and impossible it would be to put it all in one movie. Plot must be changed for purposes of continuity and other reasons. Remember that they are limited to two and half hours and cannot translate the text word for word. Overall this movie did a wonderful job of capturing the essence of what J.K. Rowling produced in her books, as well as staying true to the characters she has so vividly created for us to enjoy. Go and see this movie!!! and have a great sumer :)"
972,8,The Best Harry Potter Yet,"Like the other Harry Potter movies, I get the feeling that there was a lot left out of the original story in order to fit everything into the 2 1/2 hours of screen time. I haven't read any of the books, and it never really effected the movie experience until this episode. Did the book elaborate a little more on the Half Blood Prince? Did it tell any of his back story or is that something that we have to wait for in the next installment? It just doesn't seem like a smart thing to do to title the book after a character and then have the plot of the movie about something completely different. Instead of the story of the Half Blood Prince, we're told about Voldemort and his time at the school. It was still good. But am I really going to have to read the book to get the real story? That's lame."
973,10,The best film,This is a great film and I love it so much. I saw it again.
974,10,Fantastic for Fans!,"Please don't be put off by the negative reviews - it seems some people think it's ""cool"" to take cynical pot-shots at a successful franchise."
975,1,Hello.,"it was the worst movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!! The movie was a disappointment, the other HP's have been very good, so i expected much out of this to. The beginning was confusing, and didn't make so much sense! And the whole point of the movie... the only thing that we got to know is that Snape was a death eater ore whatever and Malfoy become a death eater as well. and that Dumbledore died, + all the romantic CRAP that was in it -.-''' HP is not a romantic film, so what was that all about? well, lets just say that the whole film was boring, and didn't make sense. So you'd better do a really good movie next time, I mean HP 7, or else u're gonna loose a lot of customers..."
976,6,OK Movie x didn't actually get what going on xx but to be fair OK xx,I was supposing a great ending to the story but got what proved to be rather amusing. The movie was OK is all aspects but didn't much do to achieve the teen choice action award. Hermonies part was rather like a High School Romance while same with Ron. It was harry to played the real story. Its more story/ Drama so if you are supposing a great action kinda Harry Potter it must not be your day. To be honest I am not a Harry Potter fan although I tend to see the movie but this movie was well not for me as such its for genuine Harry Potter fans. My rating is 5/6 as a movie but 8 for a Fan based rating. Anyways hope to see a great ending to the harry potter sequel in the near future.
977,7,I liked it but....,"This movie does serve it's purpose, serving as a gateway between the previous and up-coming films. I have to say as a passionate follower of the books and movies, I expected so much more from this film as the 6th book was my favorite. There was so much detail left out of the movie that I felt I wish would of been seen. Now I fully understand the difficulties of adapting a book onto screen and filming the most important parts of the book and trying to make everything tie itself together. I commend Yates for the difficult tasks he has before to do the series justice. Like I said, I just wish there was more detail in it, it was striped of so much and changed a tad here and there from the book. I guess it's just too hard being as the movie was already 9 reels long. I give it a 7 for my profound love of the series. All I can say is that if Yates states ""You haven't seen anything yet"" I hope he really has something special in line for us in the next two. By giving himself another movie to help finish the 7th book, I believe he will be able to add more to the movie."
978,10,Mature and Realistic,"The sixth installment of Harry Potter did wonders establishing a very real, and very terrifying backbone to the series. We have to understand that Voldemort is at large and that the Wizarding is at War. There is no more time for childish themes. This film was very good, and it stayed true to the book. I thought it was neat how mature the actors have become in accordance to the characters in the book. Doesn't skip a beat. The actors did a wonderful job, and I have to say both the drama and the comic relief offered, balanced the entire movie out, making it both entertaining and frighteningly real. Harry Potter and his gang are in for a really nasty time, and I don't think many realized it until this movie, including myself. I envisioned the horrors of Final Battle in the 7th Book, but to see it captured on screen will make the fantasy a reality. I give props to the Cast and Crew for making a wonderful film, and for making the series come to life. I can't for the 7th (& 8th) movie!! Oh...the music was magnificent."
979,5,A long wait to be let down...,"...but how can a book be better than the film? The main story of the book is Dumbledore's realisation of the existence of Horcruxes, and the crucial help required from Harry to secure possession of an old un-tampered memory belonging to Slughorn, the new potions master; and in turn find the Horcruxes and destroy them. Infected by an incurable curse, Dumbledore knows that his time is running out."
980,8,Not as bad as i thought will be!!,"I am a really big harry potter books fan, and I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I had listened a lot of thoughts on this movie and they were rather bad. Therefore, i had prepared for a really really bad movie. But, I was wrong."
981,7,Worth a watch - It's just one interpretation,"Overall, an interesting and entertaining interpretation of arguably the best (and my personal favourite) book in the Harry Potter series. I really enjoyed the film, though on reflection it might be connected to the fact that I have not read the book in over a year, and forgot parts of it."
982,,What did you expect after Goblet of Fire?,"A new record has been set. Three movies in a line, and each one worst than the previous one. Why didn't you stick with the Potter series Alfonso Cuaron?. This movie is horrible, as they were Goblet of Fire and Order of the Phoenix. It is not only the lack of screening time, but also the director. Alfonso had the same problem, but he made a wonderful Azkaban movie. He put some humor in the movie, but in an intelligent way. The last three movies are simply ridiculous. I must conclude that nowadays, people make movies for USA ( as this country is full of brainless teenagers ). If you don't believe me, just go a see Transformers 2. All the important things, that make the 6th book the best of the series, are cut out. People who had not read the books must be wondering... What is going on here? And the three kids, they are terrible. They need acting lessons urgently."
983,7,Ouch,Loved the teen hormone theme but the rest of this was a real sad excuse for an HP film. This type of film needs the ending we expect or at least something close. 
984,3,Disappointed,I was sorely disappointed in this movie not because it wasn't faithful to the book but because it felt like they just threw things in with the aim of a shot gun. 
985,9,One of the best if not the best in the series.,"This film captures the darkness and desperation brought on by the death eaters and voldemort. The acting from everyone has improved greatly, Alan Rickman gives his best performance by far as Snape. Gambon finals delivers as Dumbledore, playing him flawlessly. Then there's Tom Felton who plays the scared and troubled Draco Malfoy as if he himself was given the task of killing the greatest wizard of the age. The cave scene was done brilliantly, though some of the other ""action"" scenes were a little under-whelming. Overall, this was a big step up from OoTP. I left happy with it despite some minor flaws and it sets us up for a great ending in DH I and II."
986,1,How are they going to fix there mistakes,I understand that the next movie will be split into like Kill Bill. Too bad Tarenteno cant direct the next one. They did such a bad job I see no way that the next movie can even fix what they did. No funeral. Thats where the elder wand is at. And Ron's house burning down. Half of the 7th book takes place there. Jk Rowling should sue those bastards for destroying her book. But I guess she still gets paid. I would like to take this time to thank Warner Brothers for doing such a shitty job. I'm not even sure I will see the next one. I hope and pray that they will do justice. Or let Chris Columbas do the next one. He seemed to know what he is doing. Note to all don't buy this movie. If you never read the book you should like. If you did boycott the next one with me if they do a shitty job like this one
987,5,Harry Potter suffering from the Lord of the Rings syndrome.,"What? You might say when you look at the title of my post. Well what is the Lord of the Rings syndrome? If you read the book and watch the film there are certain deviations and certain things that are missed or not mentioned. The main reason for that is that when a writer writes a book he doesn't think: ""Well, I won't write this because the movie will become too long, no descriptions because if they have to do a movie this scene should be at least 30 minutes long, and how much will the CG cost."" No wonder Tolkein never wanted the Lord of the Rings to be filmed, while he was alive. "
988,5,Disappointing,"Visually, this film was beautiful. All of the actors were at the top of their game (special nod to Helena Bonham Carter - scared the heck out of me). My one problem - and it's a big one - was the ending."
989,4,Not for REAL Harry Potter fans...,"The six installment to this series has gotten great reviews and is said to be the best movie so far. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been an avid reader of the books since childhood. In anticipation for the movie I reread the 6th book. I was extremely excited for this since I loved the book and the reviews were all so positive, I have to say, it was by far the worst movie so far. The books are masterpieces and perfect in every way and this movie strayed so far from the book. It changed almost everything, from minor details to extremely important plot points. I wouldn't have been surprised if they changed the name of the movie from The Half Blood Prince because it barely skimmed the surface of that element to the book and the importance it plays."
990,5,"Hormones, yes. Emotion, not so much.","I thought this movie was very entertaining, but the problem I had with it is there really wasn't any build up and there was no opportunity for me to be involved with the story."
991,4,Could have been a thousand times better,"Well I just saw the movie today,and well the only thing that I can say That I'm thoroughly disappointed.The sixth book is my favorite book,and to see such a poor on screen adaptation of it,I have nothing to say."
992,4,Totall Disappointment,"After reading ZeroCorpse-1 review I have to agree with his assessment of the movie. There were definite plot story lines that were left out so that at the end when Snape said to Harry that he is the Half Blood Prince I was like ""where did that come from and why did he say it?"" There was nothing leading up to it so it made no sense. Also if there were ""Guards"" in the castle then what happened to the battle between the Order and the Death Eaters? I just read that the screen writer did not even read the book. Well if I was J.K. Rowling I wouldn't want someone destroying my books by pitiful attempts to bring them to the screen."
993,6,Worth watching but could be better,The last couple of Potter films have done something that I felt the first two didn't achieve- leaving parts of the book out without rewriting them/allowing the audience to not believe they happened in this interpretation. This film went one step further and presented things that happened in between the lines in the books- for example the bridge and Cormac being slimy towards Hermione. However certain things that didn't occur in the book but were included in the film seemed unnecessary and there purely for blockbuster duties; the blowing up of the Burrow and Hagrids' hut.
994,7,"After creating one of the worst films in the series, Yates is able to redeem himself somewhat.","Order of the Phoenix had me worried about the state of the sixth film: the editing was haphazard and the pacing was off -- in general, the whole structure was poor. Luckily, Yates seemed to realize this as well, rectifying most of his mistakes in his second entry in the Harry Potter series. It almost reaches the quality of Prisoner of Azkaban (before falling greatly). The editing has improved, the cinematography has jumped in quality as well, the pacing for the first half is good and the writing and dialog is better; however, there are still downsides such as well."
995,10,Outstanding film,"This is where Harry Potter started to get seriously amazing again like it had with the Prisoner of Azkaban. I loved the book, but Half-Blood Prince nails the dreary, dreamlike atmosphere with a standout soundtrack by Hooper. Visually immersive, this shows what you want in a film adaptation, for it it to have all the cinematic bells and whistles and more. Film has it's own necessities and you simply can't think about the book when judging a film on it's own. You want it to be a complete work of art? Well this film looks like a Rembrandt painting and is perhaps one of the most comfy films ever created."
996,6,Brilliant Movie? I think not!,"Indeed, the special effects in this film were impressive, however the movie was a MASSIVE let down to me as a big HP fan. I have read all of the books countless times, so I was expecting to notice a FEW mistakes in this movie."
997,4,An uninspired recounting of the events from the book.,"Sometimes, when a movie based on a book is filmed by people who love the book, understand it and want to only recast the story into the medium of cinema one ends up with a slightly different but no less compelling retelling of the same wonderful story. Example in case would be Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy where it is abundantly clear that he poured his heart and soul into the movies, that he was a humble admirer of the world that Tolkien shaped and that he treated the work with respect and dignity. The end result was a story that even the most die hard fans of the books could find little fault with."
998,4,"I'm a huge fan, but what were they thinking?","Like other posters, I am very upset that they chose to eliminate the pivotal fight scene only to include something that was never part of the original book. Perhaps they did so to eliminate Burrow Scenes from the next two movies but that would be devastating as the Burrow figures so prominently in the next film. Seconly, I really hated their decision to have Harry just stand by while Dumbledore was killed, in the book he was immobilized by Dumbledore and under the invisibility cloak I don't see why they thought it necessary to change that critical part. I certainly hope that Yates or his team is paying attention to what we have to say and he makes corrections in the next two films. I would be devastated to learn that he ignored our input and ruined the final two movies. JK wrote an excellent book, directors shouldn't be allowed so much creative license. I am very disappointed. Mel in Vegas"
999,8,Another brick in the wall...,"Okay, we have the teenage love scenes, the super special effects, and the best selling book to support the film. But we also have a dull scenario filled with stupid dialogues and a lot of added things that weren't really needed."
1000,4,This Movie Lost the Plot!!!,"We all know that when going from book to film some creative liberty has to take place, however the makers of this film took a very well written book and turned it into a teenage kissing fest."
1001,4,Harry Potter and the mess of a book.,"Okay, now I had a very nasty feeling about the new Harry Potter movie. The last movie was a disaster apart from the last bit where Harry was possessed. But never mind I decided to enjoy this one regardless of my annoyed reactions of the muck up of the last ones."
1002,10,Confronting the Past,"I've watched/read all the Harry Potter books and movies and it's brilliant...Absolutely brilliant. Exploring the memories of Lord Voldemort's darkest times, Harry Potter, the boy who lived prepares himself for the final battle against the Dark Lord. He taught us that in life, we may hope for something to happen, but it may not happen the way we want it. And so, we must not make a big deal about how life is not being fair and we must just accept that everything happens for a reason. One of the morals of the story is that you never know what you are capable of until you try. Harry was faced with extraordinary circumstances, and he was able to rise to the challenge. He found reserves of bravery within himself, as well as special abilities. Harry Potter had no idea that he was a wizard, of course."
1003,9,"Different formula, great outcome","Man, I can count the days I've waited for this movie to come! And you know what? It was certainly worth it. In the previous film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I had a very strong way of seeing the adaptations. I guess I was kind of intolerant because the story on-screen didn't show all the things I wanted to watch, but the fact is that, a film is a film, and a book is a book. No matter how faithful it may be to the novel, it will always sound and be different. And this film is clearly proof of that. Right in the beginning of it, we watch immediate changes in the storytelling. It doesn't start with Harry at home. It starts with an event we don't witness in the book. Nevertheless, it was nice. Different, and very creative. Most of the action that takes place on-screen had many changes, but that just makes the movie very authentic, very independent, and as long as it remains loyal to the original plot, all the rest is valid. Keep in mind that it is ""based on the novel"". This is just for you guys, Harry Potter fans and everybody else, to remember to criticize the motion picture for itself. The constant comparison between film and book only makes the evaluation difficult and unfair. There, I've said it. Now, about the movie, I loved a bit of everything in it. The storytelling was very decent, mentioning all the important events of the book, being constantly creative, smooth and fast. The screenplay was quite bold and guess what? It had precisely everything a HP movie should have: feeling, true teen hood, a very unique sense of humor and loads of fun and magic. Steve Kloves used a risky screen writing, given that the story was so radically different, and the characters, especially, the young ones, were much more credible, because they acted more like real teenagers, being rebellious, joking about this and that, full of feelings, with jealousy, craziness, boldness, and all the ""nesses"" you can come up with; love, friendship, rivalries and all that we can expect from teenagers. The acting was definitely improved, because now, Daniel Radcliffe was able to give more of himself in each scene. Emma Watson was, too, very complete. She gave us a much more detailed, pain in the neck, and annoyingly lovable Hermione. About Rupert Grint, he nailed it! He made some scenes, serious laughing matters. He helped bringing truly enjoyable comedy. When Ron had to be ridiculous, Rupert came along and made the audience laugh their heads off. Beautiful! The cinematography was precious. I think I had never seen before french cinematography in a big budget film. It was so innovative, and surprisingly magical. It totally transformed the ambient of the scenes. What else can I say? I could keep writing about this, and probably, I wouldn't be done by tomorrow. I will just tell you this: expect the boldest, strongest, and most loyal (to the the story's and JK Rowling's spirit) HP movie you've ever seen."
1004,7,Great opening...Terrible Ending...,"The film's opening sequence was breathtaking. And that's about it. The rest of the film revolves around the romance of Harry and his friends. As a matter of fact, the whole Voldemort background was nearly cut from the film, save for two shallow flashbacks. The complex story of Tom Riddle was never elaborated in the film. And this is where my list of complaints starts. Oh, and by the way, it's time for those blasted anti-book purists to swallow every single praise they've given to this film. They don't deserve to be called fans of Harry Potter, because they literally don't know anything about the importance of staying true to the books. Damn them all, if I may say so. "
1005,6,Torn between 2 sides of my brain,"Having recently re-read HBP prior to the film coming out, I was greatly distressed by how much was cut from the book: The new leadership of the Ministy of Magic, Harry's new inheritance (including inheriting Kreacher), leaving the Dursley's stunned with shame. and so much more."
1006,2,From a Hallmark director to Hollywood Hallmark director,"Well I hate the Order of the Phoenix because the bad direction and the TV movie style of the photography (like a Hallmark movie) with this one the director improve in this point but he forgot to told the actual story of this book. He was more worried about the teenage loves than the Half-Blood prince and Tom Riddle stories, well with this parallel story of the book Harry doesn't have a clue where to start to look at the horcruxes because he barely know something about the past of Tom Riddle. The director needs to back to TV."
1007,10,"Amazingly portrayed! AND YES, I am a fan of the books, and the Half-Blood Prince is one of my favorites.","Many people are saying this is an awful movie compared to the book, but honestly saying, I thought the movie was quite fun and amazing. Yes, they have deleted things, but everything necessary is there. I had very low expectations for this movie after Order of the Phoenix, but as soon as the trailer came out, I knew this movie will be amazing. The special effects are better than ever. The casting is amazing, the acting is great. By the way, come to think of it, the book itself is more of a romance and focuses on the story more towards the end."
1008,8,It's a great movie!!,"I just watched the movie and I have to say that it could not been made better ! Well it's true that there are a lot of differences to the book, but the main story is as in the book! The only thing I really disliked was the ending.....it was a little to short for my taste! The effects are great and the story went never boring......always something happened....and that's what i liked very much! After this movie I decided to read the book once again to see how it changed my view. It's always interesting to see the differences between the book and the movie and it's even more interesting to compare the pictures you have in your head after you read the book and the pictures on the screen."
1009,,FINALLY The Harry Potter Movie I've Been Waiting For!!!!,"I still can't believe that my least favorite book in the HP series turned out to be the best adaptation. Seriously, this is not only the best adaptation but an elegant, mature, layered, wonderfully crafted piece of cinema. None of the usual gimmicky amusements or wince- inducing cheesiness of the previous movies, or over the top acting. "
1010,7,"Overall, kind of disappointed with the movie","As like any other Harry potter fan, I was miffed about the movie release push back from November to July. But once I was over that, I was giddy as all can be for this movie, and I bought my tickets weeks ago to ensure a spot to the midnight show...and I must confess, as much as I wish I didn't I was fairly disappointed in the overall outcome of this movie."
1011,7,Good for those willing to ignore missing book scenes.,"I've been a fan of Harry Potter since I read the first book around ten or eleven years ago. Around the same time as the first movie came out. I'll admit that, as a fan of the books, this movie is kind of a disappointment. But the big thing to notice is that it's a MOVIE, and while it would be nice to have everything from the book in the movie, it's not possible."
1012,8,Harry Potter 6 a bit of a let down...but there is hope,"As a fan of the Harry Potter universe, I have to say that the movie was building up to that awesome fight scene at the end but the production company didn't pull through. Although I enjoyed the comedic touches and for the most part the plot line stuck to the book, I was expecting (as I am sure others were)a bang for my buck. Personally I think they should have saved the money they spent on the attack on the Burrow and used it for the end invasion of Hogwarts. All of the other little things and details from the book however could not be copied word for word and translated into the movie or else it would have been 4 maybe 6 hours long. Everyone should keep in mind this, whether you were there or not, back when the original star wars came out the empire strikes back wasn't as good as the 1st or last. It was a set up movie for the big show stopping finale, much as harry potter 5 and 6 are a set up for something (hopefully) phenomenal. With that said they should have played up the darkness factor and still broken it up with the comedy, and again that final battle in Hogwarts would have shown how much of a threat Voldemort and the Death Eaters really are, being able to infiltrate one of the safest places in the wizard world. Of course I will see the last two movies when they come out, my only hope is that they don't disappoint."
1013,6,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - I was expecting more...,"Harry Potter and the half blood prince is a highly entertaining and truly enjoyable movie. The movie overall is very good and a light hearted look at the trials and tribulations of growing teens and the relationships they ""enjoy"" plus the usual twists. In many ways the scenes are stolen by the outstanding performance of Rupert Grint. He will have you rolling on the floor laughing your @$$ off. Alan Rickman does his usual outstanding job as the ever formidable Professor Snape. Once again we are not sure if we should love him or hate him though it becomes apparent if one reads into the story a little deeper. As a newcomer (actually returning teacher) Jim Broadbent plays a very entertaining but not quite readable Professor Slughorn. Peculiar, yes, but not quite as intriguing as most of the other 'single season' professors have been. What this movie lacks is the depth. The intrigue, the mystery, the suspense and the excitement. These components all exist, but are too superficial and run by much too quickly. The characters never have a chance to draw on or show their deeper thoughts and emotions, even near the end at the movie's 'big event', when one would expect a great outpouring we have but a moment's silence and unity. No sparks, no thunder...where is the depth? The hugely charismatic Helena Bonham Carter and other villains are on screen for only a glimpse a half dozen times or less and the ever Epic battle of good vs evil..............well, you will have to see it to believe it. The cinematography and score are terrific as expected, but perhaps it is in the direction that the multi-layered characters are flattened out. Chris Columbus and Mike Newell got it..as for David Yates....has he ever read the books? I will certainly buy the DVD and enjoy it again but somehow just expected more."
1014,8,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,"The graphics were awesome... The story line was awesome... The movie made time fly by pretty fast. However, they said at the beginning they were going to make the movie into two parts and they didn't. Which I think is there biggest mistake! Even a person watching the movie would of realized that to much was missing.(Either it wasn't explained enough, or it didn't make sense) I think the fans would of been more pleased with the movie being in two parts then crammed into one movie. I hope with the next movie they fill in the gaps that were lost in this movie. Otherwise I think the directors etc did a great job for what we saw!"
1015,3,Long Movie But Not Much Action,"Somebody spent a ton of money making this movie. The special effects were great, the acting was as good as in the prior movies, but nothing much happens in this one. In fact the movie had more the feel of a long-running soap opera than a feature film. A lot of time was spent covering teen romances. A lot more time was used to drop hints about things one presumes will come in future movies, but which lend nothing to this one. Not to worry though, the movie has enough logical inconsistencies in it to distract you while you're waiting for nothing to happen. The plot does pick up a bit toward the end, but not much is resolved, and even that which seems apparent has the feel of misdirection."
1016,1,An affront to fans of the book,"This movie falls far short of any expectations I have had. I have read the books several times and have found the other movies to at least attempt to follow the book. This movie did not follow at all. For one thing they left out several key characters. You never see Bill Weasley, Fleur Delacour, Rufus Scrimgeour, and Kreacher. All these people come into play into the book in a major way so why were they not in the movie. Second they left out key points in the book. Such as Fudge being sacked and replaced by Scrimgeour, Bill and Fleur being engaged, Harry inheriting Sirius' house. They added one scene that was never in the book. The scene they added was at Christmastime when the Deatheaters attack the Weasley home. That never happens in the book. In the book Scrimgeour visit and accuses Harry of being ""Dumbledore's man through and through."" They also left out some key scenes from the book. They never show the final battle between the Deatheater and The Order of the phoenix and D.A., they never show Dumbledore's funeral. As a fan of this book I find the whole movie completely terrible. If you have never read the books then you will find this movie enjoyable but other than that I would suggest to not go see the movie."
1017,9,As a fan.. I liked it...,"First of all, I wanna apologize for my lame English... I'm just learning hehe..."
1018,8,The success had been lost for people but not for me,"Harry Potter is one of my best movie , I've never seen . It was funny listening the movie but I didn't understand why it hadn't much success and why it wasn't ranked as the world best movies. The popularity has been decrease compiler to the previous movies . I think that people are annoying but I hope they won't be for the last . It is supposed to be the Harry Potter which has most of actions. My favourite part was the intoxication of Ron with the love filter while he had completely lost his normal behaviour and also cruising professor Slughorn. The main topic for the 6th book was peace and love . There was a lot of Death Eaters and more attacks and most the suspense is awesome."
1019,10,"This Half-Blood Prince is awesomely, bloody BRILLIANT!",WARNING: This review might be a bit biased to your liking since the writer is a certified witch. So beware. You've been warned. (May also contain spoilers.)
1020,3,The Half Blood Prince,"I was so very disappointed in this film. Way too many liberties were taken with this film. The special effects were great but they did not happen in the book. The movie concentrated on Ron's love life and not the important facts of the book. Why did the screen writer feel the need to change a good thing, remember the old adage ""If it's not broke don't fix it."""
1021,8,Best potter flick to date,"David Yates has made arguably the best potter film yet, I do believe that after Chris Columbus, he is the only one to have captured the true essence of Harry Potter and yet the two directors have really contrasting approaches. Whilst Chris made two very accurate adaptations and set the tone, David Yates has not only captured the feel of the sixth book but also added a lot to it so that the movie becomes an entirely separate entity. For those who have already read the book this movie will be a good surprise because they will find that the director takes several liberties in terms of the plot but all those for the first time don't destroy the movie but enhance its effect and those who haven't read the book are in for a treat because the movie has some amazing special effects and some really good performances this time around. Not only that but this is a grown-up and the most realistic harry potter movie to date."
1022,6,not what i expected,"I had expected a bunch of magic, but what i saw was a bunch of relationships and making out. It seemed like half the movie was based on Ron and whatever her name is. Where is the action? Where is Hermione and Ron by harry's side? I'll admit, the beginning was awesome but once you reach the middle of the movie i was wondering what big event was coming up. It pretty much seemed like rising action the entire movie and then an abrupt ending."
1023,3,Very disappointing...but expected after the terrible 5th movie,"I'm reading other people's comments and they all seem to be fans of the series, but one thing that seems to be overlooked is that a movie adaptation of a book should be able to stand alone. I read the book, although it was years ago since it took so long for the movie to be released, but I really had a hard time following the movie because the book wasn't fresh in my mind. My husband, who has never read the books, had no idea what was going on and lost interest fairly quickly because he just couldn't follow it. I thought this was a terrible movie, due to a lack of a clear plot and just utter confusion from scene to scene with no transitions. We really had no idea what was happening through most of the movie. This director is terrible. He ruined the 5th movie and it appears he has no plans to improve. It's a shame. This was a great series in book form."
1024,6,"Good, but missing key points","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was my favorite of the Harry Potter series, however the movie was a big disappointment. The very beginning is what got me the most. I was looking forward to see Dumbledore tell the Dursleys to quit treating Harry horribly, but instead, they show Harry being completely reckless during the summer, and Dumbledore just picks him up at a train station, which didn't happen in the book. I was also disappointed how a few of the actors played their roles. Daniel Radcliffe didn't seem to play his role as Harry Potter as seriously as he did in the previous movies. Emma Watson also seemed to lack. The actors who I thought did the best were Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Tom Felton, and Jim Broadbent. The story focused on too much of the romance instead of Dumbledore showing Harry about the Horcruxes. I recall Dumbledore showing Harry only two or three memories. Dumbledore showed Harry many more in the book. And the Weasleys' house burning down? Where's the wedding going to be in Deathly Hallows? The movies also started to lose the magic that the previous ones like Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets had. I was pleased with David Yates' interpretation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Peonix, but after seeing Half Blood Prince, I am a little worried how (Even though it is being split into two movies) Yates will interpret Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Overall, as a movie itself, I think it did well, but compared to the book, disappointing."
1025,7,"Good, even if different from the book","I had heard some relatively bad reviews of the movie before I went to see it, so I was sort of expecting to be disappointed. As an avid follower of all things Potter, I know the book very well and was anticipating that some elements wouldn't make it into the film. This has been true for all of the other movies in the series as well, so it wasn't a shock to me in this one. I was pleased to see the inclusion of some elements that I thought might go by the wayside, such as the Weasley brothers' joke shop, the brief romance between Ron and Lavender Brown (who, oddly, went unnamed in the film), and Ron's stint as Keeper of the Gryffindor house quidditch team. However, it was odd to see the scenes that appeared in the movie but not in the book. The incident at the Burrow, while certainly effective at instilling fear and urgency into the overall situation, was a complete invention of the film-makers. And some slight differences between the book and movie were puzzling to one who has read the books many times over. For example: why was it Luna Lovegood and not Tonks who discovered Harry on the Hogwarts Express? Silly, I know, but these things drive me nuts. I was also pleased to see that, even though this film takes place at a time when both the wizarding and muggle worlds are in nearly their darkest hours, there was still a fair amount of humor and light-heartedness. The entire ""Liquid Luck"" scene borders on hilarity, and Ron's encounter with a love potion had the whole theater guffawing. I think it was refreshing, too, to see Harry and Ron get to play some really funny moments - knowing what lies ahead in the series, I doubt we'll see much of that again, and these actors clearly have the chops to play comedy as well as drama. As for casting, the new professor on the block, Slughorn, was played very well by Jim Broadbent. Though Broadbent is a little less ""walrus-y"" than the Slughorn that Rowling describes in the book, he still played the character perfectly, a little unctuous, a little vain, a little absent-minded. Interesting to me was the choice of Helen McCrory (I recognized her as the top-shelf personal security maven Amanda from the NBC series Life) as Narcissa Malfoy, mother to Draco and wife to Lucius. She played her role here well, and she will get the chance to reprise that role in the final 2 films of the series. Though she was not styled the way I would have expected, she was still a good choice for the role, and I look forward to seeing her again. Speaking of style, what happened to Prof. McGonagall? Did they run out of magical makeup? And since when does she wear a set of robes reminiscent of an evil puffer fish? The film certainly had its head-scratcher moments, but overall was quite enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially fellow Potter fans (who are going to see it anyway, regardless of reviews), but also to non-followers of the series. Unburdened by the knowledge of what the story holds for the future, the couple behind me in the theater speculated what the next 2 movies will contain while the credits were rolling. They didn't know what had been left out, and they can't wait to see how the story ends. Well, even though I know how the story ends, I still can't wait for the next movie to come out."
1026,4,The worst of the movies,"When I saw the movie, I had read the book the past week. So the story was fresh in my mind, maybe my hopes were too high. But I really didn't like the movie. Way too much stuff got cut out, although funny (where it shouldn't have been) it was overall very blend."
1027,10,Maybe movie of the year,"First of all, we must understand this: A novel and a movie based on a book, are two entirely forms of art. HP fans should stop blaming this movie for not being a filmed presentation of the book. In my opinion, as long as a director shows respect to the book, there are certain freedoms he/she can have, on the way of expressing themselves."
1028,5,"OMG, What Happened ?!",Can somebody please tell me how JK Rowling allowed this ?! This movie is rubbish ! 
1029,3,Where is the magic?,"As a big fan of the books, I have to say that ever since the third HP movie it's a really huge disappointment."
1030,9,Amazing,"**Will Contain Spoilers** So far, the negative comments that I've seen regarding this movie seem to revolve around the fact that certain elements were left out, such as Dumbledore's funeral, several memories, and the Dursleys altogether. If this really bothers you, then why did you see the first five and expect anything different? The first two movie adaptions were very close to the books, and while the third kept to the main storyline, there were several random additions that made no sense and (personally) distracted from the movie as a whole. The fourth was a complete disaster, composed only of major plot events, while the fifth was only marginally better."
1031,8,Good films....with a few disappointments,"Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE fan of both the books and the films...having read AND watched them (and listened to the audiotape) since I was 9. Having said that I've never found the films to be rubbish, despite other reviews which point out lack of content. Yes, Scrimegour does not appear(Bill Nighy will appear as him in DH) Yes, Big battle scene is left out Yes, No scolding of the Dursleys Yes, Robbie Coltrane hardly appears (forgive me Im a Hagrid fan) there's loads of missing stuff...but people seem to forget that Half Blood Prince is a 600+ book and that films rarely get more than 2 hours and a half. You cant squeeze in every single ruddy detail into a 2 hour film. I for one have always enjoyed the feel of these films, light and funny at the start and middle, and tragic in the end. The cast has always been excellent (Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, Tom Felton and Emma Watson are a pleasure to watch)despite the fact that there are so many roles they manage to squeeze in a few lines all the time...and you get to appreciate that little time you get to see them in action (despite Timothy Spall not having proper dialogue since GoF)"
1032,7,Disappointed despite the warnings.,"Half-Blood Prince was my favorite Harry Potter book. I was so excited to see this movie. I couldn't wait to see the back stories. Voldemort's history, the Potters and Snape as teens at school, etc. I waited months and months after the movie release date was pushed back. I could not have set myself up for more disappointment."
1033,7,Harry Potter and the.... love triangle?,"Being a huge Harry Potter fan I was looking forward to seeing the 6th film as all the others had been brilliant. I have been impressed with the close relationship of the books and the films in the majority of the series. However it feels that the Half-Blood Prince was the least similar- hardly focusing at all on the main story line, missing key events out such as some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore including the explanation for why the locket horcrux was hidden in the cave etc. It seems that a lot was either completely missed out or changed, which will to me possibly cause confusion during the next parts of the story line. However I can't deny that the film was brilliant in it's own way, all actors have matured greatly in skills, Rupert Grint was excellent in the HBP. However different it was to the book. The character relationships were built on using plenty of humour, this got the whole audience laughing, especially when Harry had taken liquid luck. However I feel a little too much time was spent on the romance other than the major plot. I feel that someone who had not read the books would greatly enjoy the film, however it is quite a let down compared to the book. I would highly recommend the film as it has some great moments in and truly is magic on the whole"
1034,10,Best movie ever,"I went to see this movie at the midnight showing, and it was amazing! It's not only my favorite Harry Potter movie, but my favorite movie of all time. It had a great storyline and the story flowed really well. It would have made sense to any one pretty much (even if you hadn't seen the other films). It was still dramatic while continuing to have well written jokes. It also followed the book really closely (*SPOILER*: I don't really know why they had to blow up, then rebuild the burrow)and even included most details the other films didn't have. It also set up the next film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I would recommend this move to anyone (even if they aren't a Harry Potter fan)and is great for a rainy day or family movie night."
1035,9,All is not as it seems in the best yet Harry Potter film,"In Harry Potter and the Half Blood-Prince, Director David Yates' talent shines through the dark, deep, and emotional atmosphere to strike up a sure-fire blockbuster that will have the audience both rolling with laughter, and gripping the edge of their seat. With another increasingly stellar performance from the main cast (Danielle Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) who like wine, get better with age, Yates puts together a cast and set nothing short of genius. As huge Harry Potter fans go, they are notoriously critical of the movies, but this 6th installment will have them immensely satisfied at how true it stays to the book. "
1036,10,"simply the best OHHHH, better than all the rest (tina turner)...",WOW!!! mind has been blown!! I knew this movie was going to be awesome because it had awesome previews to accompany it. I can always tell if a movie is going to be marvelous by the previews alone...Half-Blood Prince= awesome... Transformers= explosive diarrhea
1037,9,The best of the Harry Potter Films!,"I've allowed myself to sleep on the Harry Potter film before I decided to write about it. Frankly, last night at the end of the film, I was overwhelmed with excitement. I thought the movie was outstanding. Incredibly well made and quite funny. The child inside of me was excited at the magic both within the film and of the film. I follow here with thoughts on film design, content, and its conversion from book to film."
1038,6,A not so intriguing Potter,I Solemnly swear that i am up to no good....
1039,,Creepy in all the wrong ways,"**Spoilers** Let me begin by saying that I have NOT read the book. I did read the first two books and liked them very much, and I'm a fan of the movie franchise. However this film left much to be desired."
1040,7,"Great acting, but one (or two) mayor thing(s) missing","OK, first of all, I didn't know, what to think about this movie when I left theater. When the movie began, I had high hopes because they had released such awesome trailers. And it looked good for the first hour and a half. They introduced everything i wanted to see. One nice thing was the Quiditch game, that wasn't to long but not to short either. The acting of Radcliffe and the others was outstanding. They are finally no ""child-actors"" anymore."
1041,2,Nothing like the book!,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, in fact, this was the 1st Potter movie I ever saw in the Theater! I went with 3 other people and out of the four of us, I liked it the best and I would give it a C-! The visuals were great and the acting on a whole was very good! If you hadn't read the books or watched the other movies, you will have no idea what is going on! Voldy in his adult form is not in the film and neither are a majority of the characters from the book or they are subjected to very minor roles! I want to state that I understand that you can't put everything in the book into the movie but cutting things and then make up things and include them is just stupid! This is done throughout the film and it doesn't help the story. In fact, it bodes ill for the next two films because it eliminates characters and places from them! A scene with the Burrow being attacked by the DE and it burns down! Yates put this in for a action scene instead of the climatic battle at the end at Hogwarts because he said the last movie will end with a battle like that and he didn't want to repeat it! We won't see the last movie for 2 to 4 years and by then the technology will advance plus it would have given Yates an opportunity to do a better battle scene than he would have done in HBP and lastly, the two battles are totally different! In the end by excluding the battle scene in HBP, the ending is very flat because Yates changes everything about Dumbledorf's murder. From the appearance of the scene to the actions of Harry and Snape, plus makes the whole story of Draco sneaking in Death Eaters a waste of screen time because there is no battle! He has Luna save Harry on the train instead of Tonks, I don't understand that switch. Ginny/Harry romance is totally different than the book, I thought the book did it better. Very little back story is done of Voldy/Riddle and horecruxes. The story The Half-Blood Prince is totally forgotten in Yates pursuit of teen love as are every other major and other sub-plots! I really enjoyed the romance in the novel and I did enjoy some of it in the movie but not at the expense of everything else! I love the Harry Potter movies but this one was so disappointing on some many factors! I can't believe Rowlings allowed them to do this to her novel! This movie will make millions but I think in the end it will hurt the franchise because I don't see many people going back to see it again and that is what defines a great movie!"
1042,4,"no dialogs, lots of CGI.","I want CGI in movies rated just as adultery materials. This CGI madness has to stop. More CGI in a movie, more I feel like I am watching director's masturbation in his own way. When directors tend to use CGI in a movie, they just throw away all the story. Same happened with Transformers 2. Both HBP and Transformers 2 are more like combination of trailers than movies."
1043,9,No more a kids movie,"The people who haven't read the book might have a hard time understanding the plot. This movie has less magic and action compared to the previous movies, so people who are expecting to see action and magic will surely be disappointed. Half blood prince is my most favorite book in the series, the movie had covered many parts of the book but has failed to explain it well which makes it difficult to understand for a non reader. The movie was too serious unlike the previous movies which were like kids entertainer. The acting of all the cast was excellent, specially Slughorn he was just like how i imagined him in the book. Even Dumbledore was portrayed how he really should be (matured and calm) unlike how he was in the 4th movie (very overactive and jumpy). The acting has seriously improved. Some of the things which wasn't there in the book was added, they could have removed it and added thing which were in the book, for instance the climax fight in the book was something i was looking forward, but was disappointed. At times when you feel bored the comedy brigs you back to the movie. When it comes to the romance the romance between Harry and Ginny was too sudden and something was missing. But i believe the movie would have been more fun if John Williams had composed the background score instead of Hooper, his soundtracks were good but it wasn't there when the movie needed it. My favorite movie in the series would be the 3rd one, it too had most of the book covered and also the plots were clear unlike here and the background score, action, magic all were in right proposition. In half blood prince some things were at their best and some very poor. Overall this is up to now the best movie of the year but wasn't good enough. My personal rating: Acting -- 10 Cinematography -- 10 Direction --- 7 Adaptation of book -- 5 Background score -- 5"
1044,10,Saw Half Blood Prince first time from the release Date.,"I am Harry Potter Series fan from Past 15 years when i was 9 years old. I had watched first five parts till 2007 and i didnot want to see other parts because i knew that if i will see next parts then i will again go in my fantasy world because harry potter is love and you get lost in his love but recently After 12 years(1 week ago)i watched Half Blood Prince and again i lost in his love and in fictional world.It was good movie, all characters did great job I love Harry Potter Series and all are as our family, i personally like Alan Rickman,Evanna Lynch, Daniell,longbottom, rupert and all,every character is like a family member❤"
1045,8,Harry Potter and the gang are back for more hi jinx...,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was probably my favorite Harry Potter experience since seeing the original for the first time. As with the books, the maturity of the characters shows through in this film. It's a little darker, a little heavier and, of course, a big revelation in the story. They also up the ante on the humor which came across in a pretty enjoyable way. "
1046,8,A little piece of advice...,"I consider myself to have two personas within me when I watch Harry Potter films. On one hand I am the avid die-hard obsessive Harry Potter fan. From that perspective, this movie was a tremendous disappointment. I'm not going to list everything they cut out in the movie (as most other commenters have done), but I'll just say that much of the meat has been cut out and that they are going to have a very hard time with the next installment as they cut out major plot points. The Harry Potter fan in me chastises Steve Kloves for his terrible, TERRIBLE adaptation of the novel that captured my heart many many years ago. From that perspective, this was the LEAST faithful of the Harry Potter adaptations: like Slughorn's first modified memory, it was useless and a disappointment to all concerned."
1047,1,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: A Disappointing Disaster,"As a moviegoer, I was beyond disappointed with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This film was a complete disaster from start to finish, and I can't help but feel that the series has officially jumped the shark. While I was a fan of the earlier Harry Potter films, this one was nothing short of a disaster, and I'm left wondering why they even bothered."
1048,6,"compared to the others, a 6 out of 10 at its best maybe a 5 instead",let me sum it up for you. The movie is 2.5 hours long. two hours of hormones raging with everyone kissing everyone just about. With crybaby boohooing about someone kissing someone that isn't me. They throw in a couple short scenes about Tom Riddle when he was young and how drako is becoming a death eater with a job to accomplish for Tom Riddle. That's just to keep you from losing interest in the movie because of all the teen romance that's sprouting everywhere. Then the last half hour was the only interesting part of the story and was almost worth sitting through the last two hours for. what a disappointing piece of crap. It needs heavily edited with a lot more action and mystery questions to be answered. MAJOR FAIL TO MAKE US FANS WAIT SO LONG FOR THIS DISAPPOINTMENT !!!
1049,5,All Excitement Avoided,"Here we are back at the latest in the Harry Potter franchise. I left the movie being thoroughly unimpressed. Major scenes from the book were deleted or downplayed to the point of boredom. Reasonable expectations were never realized. The most exciting scene from the movie was a complete invention by the movie maker. One bright thing was seeing Bonnie Wright do a very good job in the whole movie. Ginny was quite good. This seemed to be a skeleton of the book, when adding ten minutes to the movie and not filming the scene that was a complete fiction of the movie maker, the movie could have been exciting or even compelling. My advice is to wait until the movie gets to DVD, as it certainly was not worth the price of admission and popcorn."
1050,8,Sorry to disagree but this is one of the best Harry Potter films,"OK, I've read all the comments on here and I'm aware I'm going against majority opinion here, in fact I read them all before I went to see the film last night and was therefore expecting the worst. But I was pleasantly surprised, I really thought for the most part they did an excellent job with this book and in fact I would say it's one of my favourite films. As everyone else has mentioned the acting was absolutely superb, the special effects, direction etc were all top notch. It seems what everyone has a problem with is the plot. I have read all seven books several times, and reread them just recently in anticipation of this film coming out. This is a tough book to adapt, really nothing much happens in terms of action or plot. It's predominantly background that is setting up the events of the final book and exploring the relationships of the main characters. For those who complain the film is focused too much on the romance and not enough on the story, reread the book, apart from the memories which don't translate well into a film and would bore everyone to death, and Dumbledore's death, the relationships are a HUGE part of the book! I think they did a fantastic job with it, the characters are all perfect, just how I imagined, particularly Lavendar who is just cringe-worthy. I thought in this respect they did a brilliant job. Dumbledore's death is also good, I disagree that they should have included his funeral, I though the way they did it was very good, very emotional, they didn't need the funeral in there. I also thought the cave scene in the movie was actually better than the book. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was better than in any of the other films, much more like Dumbledore than the angry old man he comes across as in the other films. And the special effects and interaction between Harry and Dumbledore were great. The only thing that I have to say I felt should have been different was the death scene, although it was good, it could have been perfect had they stuck more to the book and had Harry immobilised and the battle with the death eaters. It did seem a bit strange that Harry would just stand there and let Dumbledore die, but I guess it reinforces the fact that he trusted Snape and didn't expect it to happen, but then his reaction when it happens is kind of delayed. Also the other death eaters don't really have a reason for being there without the battle scene, why did Draco bother letting them into the castle when he had Dumbledore alone anyway and Snape to help him? Changing that would have made it perfect for me. But as for the other stuff about the detail of the horcruxes and Bill and Fleur etc. I can understand why people are worried about how they will deal with it in the final films, but let's remember that they are creating two more films and wait and see how they deal with it there. In my opinion if they add the detail into the 7th film it will be better anyway as we will be finding out about things that are relevant to that story in the 7th film. We already know the wedding is happening as it has been filmed already, but I don't think it is necessary to introduce the characters beforehand. Finally, I think people need to remember that the books and films are separate entities, why bother seeing the films if they are just exactly the same as the stories in the books, this way we get to see someone else's vision of the HP story and have something that is different and stands alone. I personally think they did a fantastic job of a very difficult book to translate into film."
1051,6,1/2 Blood Prince,"This version of Harry Potter was, as the last three movies have been, only a closely related story to the books. It, like most screen adaptations of best-sellers, always leaves you asking, ""I wish they had included (insert your many favorite passages here)."" "
1052,9,"As a sequel to a series of movies I love, it did not disappoint. As a movie adaptation of a book I love, it fell short.","For those who read the books, otherwise some of this will not make sense."
1053,,Very Disappointed..........,I watched The Movie yesterday and Let me tell u I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise Mostly the Novels...I Didn't Like The Fifth Movie But I thought May Be Because I Didn't like the story either.......So I didn't criticize the new director Back then and I said He would do Great with a wonderful story like the HBP.....Then the Movie Came out.....The worst story and direction I've ever seen in series....The result u Get By letting a British Soap opera director do a Big Motion picture....The First 2/3 of the movie u feel like watching a stupid romantic comedy with all emphasis on relationships....and some laughs.....Suddenly the whole point of the movie is Rushed in the final 1/3...actually the final scene Is rewarding but not enough to make up for what it has been preceded with...... 
1054,3,153 minutes of your life you will never get back,"Seriously, I generally like the Harry Potter series, and am not a movie snob, but this is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. With its glacier slow pacing, complete lack of suspense, and bizarre lighting, this movie will leave you feeling lobotomized. I would be angry at having lost 153 (!!!!) of the most boring minutes of my, but I am too numb to care."
1055,9,"Sectum Sempra! A great movie, I can't wait for HP7","A wonderful movie. HP has become so successful now that as many people like to stick the boot in, as those who rave about it."
1056,4,Harry Potter and the Teenage Angst,"I've seen fans of the books hate this movie. I am a fan of the books and did not like this movie. It was one of the darkest books and one of the most light-hearted movies. When I read the book, I did not care about the love triangle/square/hexagon that was going on, did you? No. I did not go see this movie to see a version of Twilight. I wanted to see the main plot line. Why was it even called Half-Blood Prince if you weren't really going to include it? And apparently Voldemort isn't important anymore. I was bored waiting for the movie to do something besides talk about love interests. Actually, I went with someone who had only seen the movies and never read the books. He was also confused about what was going on and felt the whole Half-Blood prince thing was just kinda thrown in there. Overall, he didn't seem to care much for the movie either. I think he felt that major points were left out. He was significantly confused and didn't care about Ron/Lavender. And, at the end of the movie, I was waiting for DD's funeral to happen. Then, just a black screen and credits. Wait, what? Apparently DD doesn't matter anymore either. So then, who seemed most important in this movie? Ron, Lavender, Harry (I suppose), and maybe Hermione. Aragog's death? Hilarious apparently. Nothing about this movie seemed quite right. I spent $8.50 to be sorely disappointed. My favorite book turned into my least favorite movie, and I was alright with most of the other films made."
1057,5,"No, no, no, no, no and again no","Seriously the sixth book is probably the best book in a lot of peoples opinions for it reveals so much about the past and how voldemort was born. This film had 2 important flashbacks, just two, anyone who hasn't read the book will now never know of the noble house of gaunt, of how harry finds out about the other horcruxes, unless of course they hash them into the next sequel. Yet somehow they managed to add parts to the movie that didn't actually happen in the book, the burrow exploding, come on."
1058,10,My favourite,"I know that most of the fans consider the 6th movie one of the worst but; unlike them, this one is my favourite. I do not exactly why it is but I guess this one represent the passage from a teenager to an adult, loosing tge beloved ones and facing the real worl, leaving almost everything and entering the most-desired-episodes etc. Even though it moves exteremly slow, I kind of like it. All the Snape shoots, Harry figuring things out and of course Granger and Potter understanding each other better, all makes it one of my fav."
1059,10,The funny one,As a big Potter-fan I have to say that this move is the best.
1060,3,Very disappointed,"As a fan of the books I entered the Cinema full of hope and anticipation, sadly leaving the Cinema was a completely different story.(As is the Film)....... I have always wanted to enjoy the films despite the sometimes necessary changes to plot, but for me this film was a step to far!!! The total lack of explanation regarding Dumbledore's condition and its Acquisition was one of many major omissions that left me feeling totally disconnected with his and Harry's journey. None of the books exploration of Dumbledores ""Brilliance"" and connection to Harry are covered and the ""Half blood Prince"" seems to have been reduced to a film title, with barely any of its relevance being covered and a clumsy explanation thrown in at the end!! The finale to the film is nothing short of ""Terrible"" Once you look past the special effects (which are spectacular) and the brilliant job of the actors as they fight to pull it all together I was left wondering why so many truly important scenes could have sacrificed at the expense of so many pointless ones and why so many plot changes could be allowed that had I not read JK Rowlings books I would be left wondering what ""all the fuss was about""................."
1061,7,Best movie of the series however it suffers from some flaws,"i think the movie was excellent, EXCEPT for some parts where the audience were left confused or faithful harry potter fans outraged. For example, the death-eaters attacked and burnt the burrow (Weasley house). Some people might ask what that might have been about and comments such as ""so random"" ""what the f***?"" ""weaslly are homeless"" can be heard and quite understood. There are more similar scenes such as this throughout the movie, another can be the beginning where a much older bartender hits on Harry and much unlike his character harry hits back. I think those scenes should have been totally deleted, it adds confusion to both people familiar with the story and those who aren't. I personally would have used that airtime to make the ending a bit more complicated and add a fight scene. Otherwise i think the movie was quite good and closer to the book than the rest of the movies. The comedy was nice but a little too much at times and the acting was definitely improved. I wish we could see a bit more of Snape though. I was extremely pleased with Michael Gambon's performance in this film, specially for a man who has never read any of the harry potter books. However one must note that this movie was surpassed by the book itself, one cannot understand the magic of harry potter books without reading the books. Yet this is definitely the best movie in the series. 7.5/10 for me on this."
1062,5,Feeling slightly cheated.....,Highly unsatisfactory ending to an otherwise gently amusing film. 
1063,6,Where was all the magic?,"I don't know how to feel about this movie. I had so high expectations, but I must admit that I was really disappointed."
1064,10,Mixed feelings,I feel like the books are Amazing but I like the movie too.
1065,,Horrific,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have read the books too many times to count, I have never been a fan of the films as they don't even come close to how amazing the books are, and this is the worst of a bad bunch. Massively important parts of the book are replaced by long awkward silences and close ups of Daniel Radcliffe's expressionless face. If it wasn't for the title of the film you could be mistaken that this is actually even a Harry Potter film. It is so far away from the actual book, major storylines are missed and characters wrongly portrayed. Terrible acting, terribly written and directed. I can't actually believe JK Rowling actually allowed this film to be released, it is a sham and an embarrassment."
1066,8,Could have been better.,"I thought this movie was a great way to establish Harry's journey during the final 2 movies. It establishes Toms character through his backstory and the danger of the horcruxes. Dumbledore is looking super badass and Draco's task is heartbreaking as he is forced to do something he simply is not ready for. The soundtrack is also one of my favorite, with ""Inferi in the Firestorm"" and ""Dumbledore's Farewell"" being some of my favorite scores from, throughout the 8 films."
1067,9,"Solid movie, excellent cast, storyline sometimes questionable",If you are a fan of the books (as I am) and want to give yourself a treat by watching this movie: forget about the book (and don't think too much about the 7th of the series) and simply enjoy the cinematography!
1068,5,Something was missing!,"I was looking forward to the battle at Hogwarts towards the end of the movie and when it didn't happen. It had such an anti-climax effect on me. I left the cinema feeling lost! The director obviously had done a great injustice to the book by adding new events (like the burning of the Burrow) while omitting others (the climatic battle at Hogwarts, Voldemort's family history, more details on the Horcruxes etc). I mean, why can't they just stick to the book?! By changing events, they now have to film other made-up events to fill in the gaps in the final 2-part movies."
1069,6,Disgraceful to the Harry Potter true book fans,"I was extremely excited about going to see the film especially because of how much dark and mysterious the book is. I wanted to cry at the end of the movie not because of its ending, but because how boring and flat the movie was. ----Contains spoilers---- If you are an true book fans I believe it will be better off reading the book again instead of watching the movie. I dragged my boyfriend to watch it with the promise that there was going to be a lot of action during the film but I was deeply disappointed. The movie spent more time going in between scenes about the flirting among all the young Hogwarts students and very vague understanding about the Dark's Lord past. I was looking forward to all the memories it should have included and the impressive wizard fights when they break into the castle. Dumbledore's end was too quick and sudden with no funeral! What annoyed me the most was how horrible Ginny was! Pointless love scenes among them. The only scenes I enjoyed were the ones with Lavender Brown. There was truly no action in the film (maybe Quidditch) and it seemed to drag so much even though this is an extremely important book (film) in order to understand the seventh book and the destruction of the Dark Lord. Gosh I am so mad about the film. If you have not read the books you might find it occasionally funny, cute and maybe ""dark"" but I would suggest to pick up the book and start reading it."
1070,9,"A good movie, with a lot missing.","Despite Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince being an excellent movie, it is lacking in much of the important story."
1071,1,The Worst of the Book is Thrown into the Movie,"Great For Romantic Fans,"
1072,9,Glad I saw it when I had the chace,"It's definitely worth seeing I've never really been able to get into the series and have never bothered to see any of the other films and after having the basic plot explained to me I was able to pick up on the plot and watch the movie. The visual effects were top notch and you see acting that can only come from people who have basically grown up together. You can tell that they're not only friends on the set but off the set as well, but I digress. I don't really need to give a basic plot line but I will anyway. Harry and friends are back at Hogwarts and Dumbledoor has Harry after Voldimorts secrets via. memories. Anyway It was an enjoyable film and I recommend it. The only reason I wasn't able to get into the series was because I thought it was geared toward a younger audience and that the first three films were a bit childish. I'm glad I took the time to see this film. Check out my full review of this and other summer movies at: http://openmindedfilmreviews.blogspot.com/"
1073,2,"Horrendous movie, Disastrous adaptation",I cannot remember when I have seen a worse movie than Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince... 
1074,6,Not my favorite part of the Harry Potter story,"This part of the story is almost devoid of the outstanding freaks that graced the previous series - like Grimm's Evil Eye or Sirius Black. The appearances of the witch Helena Bonham Carter and the darkest Alan Rickman are too brief, the excellent dramatic actor Jim Broadbent playing the potions professor is too ""normal"" to give the action any of the light-hearted ferocity that has graced the series. And surprisingly, there is little magic in the film. The destruction of London Bridge by the outrageous Eaters, the most dramatic spectacle of the film, is briefly glimpsed in the beginning, and the obligatory quidditch match, wand duels, potions lessons and other indispensable paraphernalia of the series are already perceived as routine<br /><br />I think the most important thing in this series is not to lower the bar. To keep it, and better to raise it higher and higher."
1075,8,great adventure film,"Although the adaptation lacks many of the good scenes described in the book, if we talk about the movie, it is a good movie, interesting and tense scenes and a good connection to the story. One thing I don't like is the color mode in which the whole movie is shot, it makes it look weird. Rupper and Daniel's acting looks very strange, I don't remember if this was the case in the book, but it doesn't look good in my opinion. Finally, it's a very interesting story as we know a lot about the backstory, and if you're not seeing the saga for the first time, there are things that make a lot of sense. It's an interesting movie for daytime viewing, only if you've already seen the saga not as a standalone Harry Potter movie."
1076,8,Crucial moment,"Definitely, this is one of my favorite parts of the saga of the well-known series of books. In her<br /><br />we are introduced to secrets and new characters and old ones are revealed."
1077,9,Must-see,"I think the Half-Blood Prince is my favorite part in the series of both movies and films. This is probably the saddest part, but still. There are quite a few powerful scenes that reveal the interpersonal relationships of the characters. Team building, friendship and quarrels, all this makes the film very memorable. Bellatrix also appears here, who was excellently played by Helena Bonham Carter. She combined a child, a crazy and flirtatious girl. A very energetically powerful villain. I recommend watching this movie."
1078,10,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Film ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is based on a book by Joanne Rowling with the same title. This film is a fantasy."
1079,5,Disappointed,"I am sorry, but I do not understand how so many people are loving this movie. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. They left out the two main parts of the story of the sixth book. Where is the battle? Where is Dumbledore's funeral? Why is Fenrir just a side character with no lines? Where are all the flashbacks? Especially the first at the Gaunt's. I am sorry to be one of the few who was not as pleased with this title. I just don't understand how the climax of the book can be left out of the movie. And what in the heck is the added scene at the Weasley's....Pointless. I did enjoy the cave scene however. I thought it was done quite well and the depiction was pretty close. I have been a die-hard Harry fan since the beginning and have read all of the books at least 3 times each, 5 times for the last three books. I enjoyed the movie but was definitely disappointed with it."
1080,2,If your a harry potter fan from the books keep away from this or you may find all the magic has left hogwarts.,When I first came onto IMDb after watching twilight I expected my own savage dislike of the poor acting and terrible directing to be reflected in a meagre IMDb writing.
1081,7,Half Blood Prince,"My favourite film's Harr Potter and I love Harry Potter books. This film is very impressive. It's has got big actors: Michael Gambon,Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman. My favourite actor is Alan Rickman because he is the lead actor in this movie and really succesful. I think this movie is the most emotional of the Harry Potter series. ""Happiness is always there. Just remember to turn on the light in the darkest time."" -Albus Dumbledore."
1082,9,HBP is a wonderful movie,"I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be a movie filled with humor, thrills, and suspense. Now to address some gripes some reviewers had with this film."
1083,4,"the movie is cool, but WTF is with 3D","The movie was up to standards of the Potterian and if I'd watch it in a regular theater I'd rather love it and gave some 8 points. But, unfortunately, we decided to wait for quite a while to get the most possible out of it, by going to watch it in 3D IMAX. THAT WAS A MISTAKE! I'm not sure if it was stated anywhere, but the movie runs in 3D only the first 15, the most uneventful, minutes or so. If it were the first 3D movie ever, I guess it could be an excuse. But it were not! I felt robbed, by paying extra $7 and getting an even worse quality movie, I'd get in a regular theater."
1084,4,My least favourite Harry Potter movie.,"I LOVE Harry Potter, read the books and watched the moves but the Half-Blood Prince is disappointing. I'll start off with the positives: The starting visuals are brilliant, shame it couldn't br this good the whole movie. The memories are also brilliant. Dumbledores death is also done very good. But for the movie flaws, the movie is WAY to relationship focused, I don't need to see Ron and Lavender Brown over like an eighth of the movie. The memories are good but why does it not show all of them, I would've loved to see the Gaunt Family and all the others not just 2. Also why was the burning of the burrow there? That was uneccessary and didn't need to be there. One final thing, what is the movie called? It is called Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince. How much of the Half-Blood Prince is there? Only like 3, the reveal it was Snape Aldo sucks, am incredibly disappointing Harry Potter movie."
1085,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Harry Potter. The name alone causes screams around the world. 'The Half Blood Prince' was not only my favorite series, but it was also one of my all-time favorites."
1086,6,"Once again I must ask too much of you, Audience!","I really enjoyed the first three parts, liked the fourth, struggled with the fifth and have been left totally irritated by the actual part! It seems - FOR ONE WHO HAS NOT READ THE NOVELS - necessary to be in possession of a SIXTH sense, to understand the plot of the HBP by only watching the movie. What prefigures during the OOTP is the impossibility to picturize in 2 hours what lasts 607 pages!"
1087,4,The movie was pure butchery of the book!,"Having read all the books and viewed all the movies to date I can say this film was my first real disappointment. The film was a total butchery of the book! I understand they have time constraints and they have to cut out some parts. They left out too many explanations and rushed through several key sub-plots. They should have thought it out more clearly what to include and what to discard. The fact that they added a scene that, while dramatic, was a complete deviation from the real story line. They could have lengthened the show by about 10 minutes and set everything on path. I wont even mention the butchering of the ending. I truly hope the last book is followed more closely. Tho I can't help but feel the magic has been lost."
1088,6,The point of view of a guy who has not read the books.,"First of all let me state that I am not a hardcore Harry Potter fan. I have not read the books, however, I have watched all the previous movies. Having said that, I found this movie somewhat slow. Although it did explain a great deal of stuff, I thought the movie lacked action scenes. The previous movies of Harry Potter I thought to be very entertaining. There was a great deal of action, magic and interesting stories. They were the kind of movies that drive one to go to the movie theater, I mean who doesn't want to see magic in a wizard movie? This movie on the other hand lacked a lot of that. On the other hand it did explain some intriguing stuff which I found very interesting but not enough to drive my attention throughout the whole movie. As a result, I felt bored and even sleepy at times. Even though I might understand why some fans find this movie particularly amusing, I don't think it is worth the money for outsiders of the HP world like myself. Once again, this review is intended to give some insight to people that might want to watch a good adventure/fantasy movie."
1089,10,honest review WITHOUT spoilers,"In the 2009 screenplay, written by Steve Kloves, Harry Potter is brought into a new light. He must choose between the paths of a normal teenage life or follow to be ""the Chosen One"" and destroy the lasting remnants of Lord Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the new action, fantasy, and adventure movie of the year, with just a hint of romance and mystery. Staring Daniel Radcliffe as the lead role of Harry Potter, Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), the trio set off in their 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
1090,5,Phoning it in...,"To start off, I will admit that I am indeed a Potter Purist. I have read all of the books several times, but I understand the translation from novel to film often leaves certain points from the book out. And, as with all of the Harry Potter books, it is impossible to cram every plot point into a movie that people will actually sit through. With this clarification out of the way, may the review begin: "
1091,5,Yates successfully ruined the best book of the series,"Remember the lord of the rings trilogy? Each installment pushed three hours and everyone sat through that and loved every minute? The Return of the king obtained a clean sweep at the Oscars which is the smallest hint to how great the films were. This movie skips over so many vital portions of the book and emphasizes the love stories with horrific acting. For most fans I have full confidence in saying this is the worst interpretation of a Harry Potter Book and they should have hired better writers and a better director who actually read the book. I am not sure if they are worried about time or whether little children would follow but this book was a work of art and to disgrace it with this awful editing and plotting really rubs me the wrong way. Take a chance and be bold, follow the plot! Two positives: Malfoy did a good job portraying the scared,dark hesitant character and the cinematography was excellent."
1092,4,"the weakest in the series ..""I want my money back""","Too little action, too much fluff, and, at the end.Definitely the weakest film yet, The movie was just plain AWFUL! ""I want my money back"". Consider me highly disappointed in that this is by far the weakest film of the series, and that's saying something after the extremely dull Order of the Phoenix."
1093,4,Bloody free spirited screenplay!,"Just FYI, I just started rereading the half-blood-prince and am about in the middle of it. "
1094,9,Fantastic Segway...,"Whether you will love or hate this movie seems to depend almost entirely on whether or not you can accept that it is in fact a movie based upon (rather than a literal translation of) the book. If you recognize that the screenplay writers needed to take extreme ""poetic license"" in order to cram the ""essence"" of such a long book into just 2.5 hours, then you will most likely enjoy this movie tremendously. Furthermore, you will leave the theater anxious for the next installment because this movie does a great job of setting up for the Deathly Hallows. Like the five HP movies before it, this one strays greatly away from the book it is based upon; however, it does a wonderful job of communicating the overall ""message"" of the book. I loved seeing how each of the characters has evolved and I must admit I've become quite ""emotionally attached"" to them in that I cared deeply what happened to them while I watched the show. In addition, I am really looking forward to what happens in the next movie. The only reason I wasn't so upset at Dumbledore's demise at the end (as I was the first time I read the book), is because from book seven, I now have the benefit of knowing why as well as what will happen next. For me, this is arguably the best Harry Potter movie so far and I may even head to the theater again (I usually wait till DVD release to watch them a second time)."
1095,6,A bit disappointing for a non-die hard potter fan.,"Having never been a die hard fan, or having read any of the books, I have enjoyed the Harry Potter series because each installment has been full of adventure, excitement, intrigue, a bit of romance, and, most importantly, a good storyline. I have watched all movies several time and enjoyed them each time. "
1096,4,weak teenage romance movie,"that is what this movie was, there were very few and far between parts of the movie where it was interesting, then the rest focused on the silly little love triangles going on in their school. they had some of these in the past movie where it only took up about 15 or so minutes of the movie, but this time around their silly romances took up a very large portion of the movie.. these portions were incredible stupid and incredibly boring, i felt like i was watching a really really bad soap opera, it makes me laugh seeing the high ratings this movie is getting because people just see ""harry potter"" so they immediately give it the rating of 8+ without even thinking about what it is that they just put themselves through for 2 hours.. anyway this movie was bad. and i am someone who has enjoyed the other hp movies."
1097,10,The Best Of The Series!,I thought this Harry Potter film was the best of them all. I was not disappointed at all. I've read all the books & seen all the movies. Trust me this Harry Potter does not disappoint.
1098,4,Technically great.,"I was really looking forward to this movie, now I'm thinking WTF!$!?. The Half Blood Prince was a great book and the movie castrated it. From a technical point of view this movie was amazing. Cinematography, CGI and the musical score were truly brilliant. For those things the movie scores full marks but story wise it was really Sh*t in comparison to the book. After seeing what Yates did with the Order of the Phoenix I felt immediately that he should finish the rest of the movies left in the series. After watching his latest effort I take it all back. Even though the movie was roughly 2.5 hours long, I felt that some of the actors didn't have enough time to really create a meaningful impact. Everything about the story just felt extremely compressed. One of the biggest letdowns that this movie has is the way it dealt with the ""climax"", it was massively disappointing. I'm not sure if there were budget constraints in regards to how it should have built up to the climax, because after the money the previous movies have made, it really shouldn't have been an issue to leave out what would have been an exciting part of the movie(those of you that have read the book will understand). Like I said earlier, this movie has redeeming qualities. I was constantly glued to the screen because this movie has some serious eye candy. The cinematography and the way that Yates directed some of the scenes were breath-taking. The musical score was better than the previous films and the CGI was on par with most decent blockbusters. If you've read the books you will more than likely ignore all negative criticism and watch the movie anyway, which will more than likely leave you feeling disappointed."
1099,6,Wtf...,"As I have seen and read all of the series, I knew where the movie was going...and I kind of enjoyed it... putting the emphasis on ""kind of"". However, the movie leaves out important stuff. They substituted it with some humor ...which wasn't THAT funny. It was maybe worth a chuckle here and there, but nothing more. Throughout the first part I was thinking this was a romantic comedy or something....like we were watching some soap opera. Cut the crap, I'm not here to see Hermione go ""oh my gaawd....I love ron...but he's with that chick...oh my gaaawd"". Yes, it should be a part of the movie, but not THE part of the movie. I came to see Harry Potter do some magic, not get a hard on from Ginny. I want action, adventure and yeah... a hint of romance. If you're going to watch this with the same expectations...this movie is going to disappoint."
1100,5,"If you want to enjoy this movie, Turn off your brain...","Regrettably, I wasted 3 hours waiting at the theater for this movie to start. I was excited and even contempt with the 12 year old girls running around in capes because I thought it was all worth it to see the movie! ...I was wrong."
1101,10,A pivotal film,"I think Half Blood Prince is quite an achievement as a film, which I think was Yates' intent. He has stopped trying to make books on film and started making cinema. HBP is, in a way, the end of the previous Potter series and the beginning of a trilogy that will stand on its own as great films that tell a truly Epic Tale. You can see the succession clearly if you watch the last three in sequence: Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, and Half Blood Prince. Each is darker than the one(s) before. In each, the main characters lose a bit more innocence (in a way, the first three were about Harry the abused nephew regaining a sense of wonder and innocence). The Harry Potter that emerges in HBP is not a boy-wizard anymore. He is a man, grown too soon. He is The Man who must defeat Voldemort. And he, Hermoine, Ron, and their friends must do it on their own, on the strength of what they have learned and the innate talents they possess. I am *really* looking forward to the last two films because Yates has now put his own stamp on the telling of the tale, and I love it. The young actors have matured in their characters and their craft to the point that they can handle the challenge of making film instead of a book projection."
1102,4,Harder and harder to understand,"I watched this film over the weekend without reading any reviews to hopefully have a clear mind. Unfortunately, I was still disappointed."
1103,9,"Great movie, but a bit of disappointment","As a movie goer, and compared to the other ones, I personally LOVED it. Here's why: 1: I loved how the comedy was intertwined with dark, creepy images of Draco Malfoy. I found that it was really well done, and it put in something for everyone. 2: The hormones of the teens really start kicking in. The whole Hermione/Ron love/hate story cracked me up. 3: That undeniably funny/awkward scene where Ron and Harry are in the dormitory talking about 'nice skin'. That scene alone deserves to be paid 10$ to be seen. 4: It wasn't all doom and gloom as it seemed the 5th one was (to me). 5: There was no pacing with extra talking, the movie had a good beat (it switched from fun (Ron/Hermione) to creepy/scary (Draco) to suspenseful (Harry and Dumbledore visiting memories)and it kept going around the cycle). 6: Great acting. They made me love all the characters. 7: I actually liked the scene they added. It's one of those rare cases where adding a scene from a book-based movie didn't turn out disastrous, although I would have liked to have seen them extinguish the fire, because it made me a bit sad to see them all so scared and sad. But I was also a bit disappointed, as an avid fan of the books, for these reasons: 1: Probably the biggest reason, THERE WAS NO FIGHT SCENE. I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to it the most. 2: Not much Neville, no Scrimgeour, no O.W.L. grades received, not much Fred and George, no Bill and Fleur... a lot of things were missing. 3: Not much explanation over Horcruxes, and not many important memories were shown, so it might difficult to understand the last ones for non-readers. Apart from that, I found it overall a very good movie. Basically, if you've read the book you'll think a lot of things are missing, but you'll understand it better than if you haven't."
1104,5,And.... what was the point???,"In my opinion, this movie failed as a Harry Potter film not so much because the scenes were poorly made, but because the scenes were poorly CHOSEN."
1105,5,"Wow, just wow","I am a very big Harry Potter fan. I've read the books and seen all the movies. While it is understandable to stray from the books a bit and leave things out to cut it short, this movie took it way too far."
1106,8,"Loved it, but feel like I got stiffed somewhere....","I can't explain it. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I've waited years, months, hours, minutes. Counted down. Background: I read bits and pieces of the first two books, and the 4th book before the 4th movie came out. Having been disappointed by the things they left out I vowed to not read the series until after the movies were finished because it ruined the 4th movie for me. This movie made me change my mind. I knew things were missing, but it irritated me because I couldn't tell what."
1107,5,HP HBP receives an Overall C-,"In comparison to the other movies and to the books themselves, whilst taking into consideration acting and direction, storyline, visuals/sound efx and SoundTrack. I gave this Movie an Overall C- in HP Terms an A for Acceptable. The Acting was awarded a B+ Based on acting skills with the exception of Michael Gambdon who left something to be desired. the Visuals etc.. received a B+ as well for the outstanding/Excellent job that it incurred. However the Storyline was a C- to D+ as it completely and utterly was disastrous. The Direction I also gave a C- to D+ as I fear the Direction that the story line Alterations have not only affected just this movie but the 7th and final one to come."
1108,7,Very boring and leaves out valuable info,"Overall i liked the movie very much but it leaves out so much information that is crucial for the next movie. in the book dumbledore told harry to not tell anyone about the hocruxes except for his best friends. Also Dumbledore and harry discussed what the other horcruxes might be, this gives harry a HUGE lead for when he goes to look for them. also harry got a big hint on how to destroy a hocrux in the book with basilisk venom but nothing in the movie. i honestly don't see how they will be able to make these next movies without these facts."
1109,9,"Good setup for HP7, Focus on relationships, Will be better in hindsight","As I exited the theater after the midnight showing, I noticed that the younger crowd was very disappointed and were noting several changes and details that were left out, and the older crowd was pleased overall. I'm not sure if that's because us older folk are used to movies leaving out detail or if we realized that the undertones of this movie are very important to the overall series."
1110,8,Mike Todd,"Hey Mike You missed the boat entirely. These books were never written as R rated and if you read that into them you need help. I will agree that the movies need to be more faithful to the book, but they did not leave the overall story line. All the major parts are included. Ron's romance with Lavender, Vane going after harry. The parts of the story you mentioned especially Tom Riddle's murder of his father and grandfather do not add anything to the story. We know that Tom is a bad seed. Are these scenes necessary i don't think so. you seem to want to make the many players much older than they are. You need to Remember that Harry, Ron and Hermione are only 16 and most of the other students are younger. Last but not least I think most people go to the movies to relax and enjoy not looking for a dark experience."
1111,9,"Great acting, stop hating","I have read the books countless times, and the sixth more then usual in anticipation for this movie. I realize big parts were cut out, but it was said before Bill, the funeral, the end fight, were all gonna be cut. We all saw the movie you don't need to keep complaining, what are you gonna do the movie can only be so long. Yes the part with Luna having such a large role made me angry to, but for all the people crying about how too much stuff was moved along such as relationships, they have to or people who didn't read the book would not understand. The acting was incredible, easily the best of all of them. Your just ignorant if you read the book and assume everything you wanted is in the movie. They don't have time to add in the chemistry between Ginny and Harry. Please commenting about how much stuff was caught out, we get it, it happens with every book to movie. Great movie, great acting, okay direction, great visuals, best it could have been."
1112,7,Great attempt but not quite achieving what the film needs.,"This film was directed well within its own choice of material but missed parts of the book which should have been included. Before I went to see the film I was on you-tube watching some of the interviews with some of the cast and other celebrities and I heard a comment from Graham Norton saying ""Why read the books, they make them into films! Why spend hours when you can watch them in two and a half hours... and it's in colour!"" This comment made me think whilst watching the film, i wonder how much of this you can really understand without reading the books because the films cut so much of the really important information out which is then difficult to grasp without the background knowledge. Unfortunately, we have become dependent on visual images now because of it being so easy and you don't have to put any effort into watching a screen. "
1113,4,Poorly done...,"I would have to agree. I feel that this movie was poorly done. Book 6 in the Harry Potter series is the first true acknowledgment that ""War"" has arrived. There was no indication of this in the film. There are scenes missing from the movie that are crucial to the development of other characters who become key in the battle between good and evil."
1114,9,Great Movie!,"First of all, this movie was awesome, it was a great thrill ride throughout and everything was gorgeous. Everything was beautifully composed and put together in the movie, and as all ways the killing curse was amazing. Second of all, I've read the books and I understand that they left quite a bit out, but honestly, this is really just build up for the 7th book, the only big thing that happened in this book was that Dumbledore dies and the horcruxes are discovered. Lets face it, no matter how good they tried to make this movie, the 7th movies will blow it away, there's so much more in the 7th book and thats why they are making two parts to it. I enjoyed this movie and i cant wait for the last installments!"
1115,7,Good movie if you see it for what it is.,"I have read the comments, Read the book, and now seen the movie. All I have to say is that Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good movie. We have to remember a few things here. First the movie was an interpretation of the story. Is it like the book? Yes. However there are some that think that the movie lacks certain parts. This is true it does lack certain parts, one of these parts are the big battle at the end, the funeral and other parts as well."
1116,7,"Great movie, despite obvious plot changes","I am an avid Harry Potter fan, both of the books and movies. Obviously, a lot of Potter fans have been disappointed with this movie. However, they need to give David Yates & co a break. Although I was extremely disappointed that they cut out the big battle scene at the end of the book, which really wouldn't have added much more time and was one of the best parts of the book, Yates obviously couldn't have possibly put every single detail in the film without it being unbearably long. I do agree that the burning of the Burrow was unnecessary, although the short battle scene with Fenrir and Bellatrix was pretty cool, and the entire movie's plot line was changed from Voldemort to Teen Love Soap Opera. The amount of time they spent portraying the different love triangles could have been used explaining Tom Riddle's life and the Horcruxes. This felt like a ""Half Blood Prince Part I""; they will have a LOT of explaining to do in Deathly Hallows Parts I&II. Bill and Fleur's relationship was completely cut out, a lot of important Tom Riddle memory scenes were omitted, and the reveal of the ""Half Blood Prince"" felt like an afterthought. Severus Snape quickly said ""Oh, I'm the Half Blood Prince"" and then walked away. Dumbledore's death was rushed, and nothing really seemed to happen afterward, unlike Sirius' death in Order of the Pheonix. His funeral was not included, but I'm sure it will be in Deathly Hallows Part I. All that being said, I still think it was a great movie. The Tom Riddle scenes that were included felt dark and eerie, and correctly portrayed the beginning of his alter ego, Voldemort. Tom Felton did an incredible job as Draco, the audience could feel his fear of completing the task Voldemort assigned to him and the fact that old Voldy would kill his family if he did not complete it. He was no longer just this high school bully character who wanted to make Harry's life difficult; we saw more depth and emotion from him. Lavender Brown was just as obnoxious and overbearing as I expected her to be, and the scene in the train where she draws a heart on the window was equal parts creepy and hilarious. Overall, I felt the movie somewhat explained the true plot, but not nearly as much as it should have. Yates could have made an incredible battle scene at the end, and missed a huge opportunity by cutting it out. It was a valiant effort, and I did enjoy the movie. This was the first midnight showing I have attended, and I still believe it was worth the waiting and the cost."
1117,6,What were they thinking????????????????,"I took my grandsons to see the movie last night. I have read the series several times and was anticipating this installment with relish. This was, in my opinion, the richest, most informative chapter of the saga and explained so much."
1118,10,Overall Good Film,I love the books but have learned to just enjoy the movies for what they are: loose interpretations and have enjoyed every film of the series.
1119,,really? you're serious? wow.,"OK so it was Tuesday night and i was totally geeked for the midnight show of my favorite thing in the world harry potter!! I'm thinking to myself this is going to be soooo intense and the action scenes are going to be crazy! The time passed, my eyelids actually got droopy while I was watching (and i napped before the movie) and suddenly it's 3am-ish and I'm confused... where was it all? Did I miss something?!?!?! WTF? This was so disappointed that I'm stupefied. I have read and own all the books and considering this movie is supposed to be the book on the screen I was under some sort of impression that they should be similar. silly me. Granted, books made into movies are never entirely accurate, but they stick to the basic plot, whereas this did not. at all. ever. They focused far too much on romances and rushed through the important parts. I cried more about my the 3 hours of my life I lost than that REALLY IMPORTANT SCENE that took all of 3 minutes. Now I would like to express my opinion to those who thought this was a good job, made them laugh, etc. um.. hi this series isn't about comedy if that's what you were looking for i might suggest ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" or perhaps ""Bruno""? Harry Potter is not a romantic series, a comedy serious, a warm-hearted love fest, or any combination of those. sorry. I've read some of these rave reviews people that given and it makes me want to vomit. I expected amazing, top of the line, best in the series and I got drivel. I got left over parts like if a good screen writer or whatever took the book made an excellent script/storyline and I got to see the leftovers. all I have left to say is YUCK. THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT"
1120,10,sumptuous telling of a careful tale,"While I can appreciate the reservations of some of the earlier commentators, personally I find this to be one of the better in the fairly good series of Harry Potter films. I think this film is one really for those who have enjoyed the books in that it captures the texture -- if not all of the details -- of the imaginary world of wizards and Hogwarts School. The purpose of the film is not to reproduce the book but rather to tell a story in a very different medium and, please note, with the full artistic collaboration of the authoress, JK Rowling."
1121,4,Half-Blood What?,"I think the previous commenters have already covered everything that was omitted from this film. If you have read the books, at least you had some frame of reference for the action that was happening, but I pity anyone who was only vaguely familiar with the series because they would have been left totally clueless as to the reasons behind the action. Hello - the book is called Harry Potter and the HALF-BLOOD PRINCE. When did the ""half-blood Prince"" part become secondary to the plot? About ten minutes from the end of the film we have Snape saying ""oh, by the way, those are my spells and i'm the half-blood prince"" - the end? The book itself, which plays such an important part in the story, makes a short appearance before it is tossed away - much like other important plot points (Slytherin's ring?) and creates tension between Harry and his friends and also with Snape (with funny results)."
1122,7,What happened to the end? Did they just run out of money or something?,"I thought that this was possibly the best of the movies so far. I did not like that they cut out/ downplayed many of the minor characters ,such as Neville and Seamus Finnegan who only appeared a few times in the film and Percy and Bill Weasley and Fleur who didn't appear at all. Also, after the point that Harry and Dumbledore leave to find the horcrux the plot COMPLETELY diverts away from the book and does nothing but disappoint. Not to mention the ENTIRE final battle at Hogwarts which was my favorite part of the book, and didn't show the fighting skills of pretty much everyone. However, the mood in this film was the lightest since ,possibly, the first one, and was overall good."
1123,7,Would be more enjoyable if you're not a purist - sadly for me,The first scene I was dissatisfied with was Horace Slughorn's appearance.
1124,3,aaaaargghhhh,"Harry Potter.... half blood prince.. right, first of all, love the books. read all the negative reviews and believe them!!! They are true. Ech time a read a positive review it's like somebody was rented to describe this great movie and everything. First of all: Daniel Radcliff is everything BUT a great actor... The movie doesn't tell a story, it tells bits and pieces and lets the viewer make up the in between... "
1125,8,Half Blood Prince: Good but not Great,"This HP movie was overall very good. It had the very best acting of any of the other Potter films. All the young actors have really improved their range and look completely at ease on screen. I was afraid when I heard that this movie was going to focus on romance that it would stink. Everyone did a superb job with the teenage love interest, making it funny and sincere at the same time. This movie had more funny moments than previous HP films. It really helps lighten the story (that is overall fairly dark).Luna is a riot and I was very glad to see her featured. The casting was excellent especially with Broadbent as Slughorn. This movie made me care about the characters. Felton did an excellent job as the tormented Drago(even though he looked 25). While the action was lacking in this film some of it was very good. The beginning was better than the book and the part inside the cave could not be better. Thank goodness that they brought back Quidditch, they did very well with that part of the film. While some of the story line was changed, not all of it was bad. The kiss between Harry and Ginny ,while not the same as the book,was very sweet and I think that considering they had barely developed Ginny's character in the other movies Yates did pretty well with it."
1126,8,"If you want the book, stay at home and read it. If you want a fun film, go out and enjoy it!!",Spoiler or two! 
1127,6,The best so far - but why change some of it ?,"Firstly, I have read each and every Harry Potter book, but I understand that a film is never going to satisfy each reader, as everyone imagines scenes in their own way. However, I thought this film was one of the best HP's so far, for several reasons. I felt the actors really managed to excel in this film. Daniel Radcliffe actually seems to become 'harry', rather than an awkward teen actor only portraying a two dimensional character. Emma Watson ends her excessive over-acting and becomes much more likable as Hermione, and Rupert Grint shows himself capable of comedy in many scenes which verged on slapstick. Jim Broadbent and Jessie Cave were spot on in the role of Slughorn & Lavender, Tom Felton perfectly portrayed the desperate and tortured Draco Malfoy, and for once, I felt Michael Gambon actually did justice to the character of Dumbledore, an area in which I have always thought he has failed in the past. Bonham Carter, as always, was flawless as Bellatrix Lestrange. However, where some characters were allowed to reveal themselves, others who could have developed even further, such as Neville, became insignificant and almost a joke. "
1128,8,Decent tho still lacking,"I really liked this movie, it was far better then Goblet of Fire but was still lacking in several departments, causing some minor disappointments. First and foremost there is the lack of information on the Half-Blood Prince even Snape revealing he is the Half-Blood Prince is kind of melodramatic and confusing, why where did the name come from etc. If you hadn't read the book the reason it is titled such. The other major disappointment is that Dumbledore has been so unrelatable and disconnected in the other movies that unlike his book his death was not even sad or really all that moving. I felt more when Sirus died then Dumbledore I'm not sure this is a discredit to this particular movie or the series as a whole, that Dumbledore is not all that relatable in the movies which is one of the many major contrast from the books and I have a feeling in another up and coming death in the next movie, that I will not feel as close to those characters either for it really to effect me. Other then that the acting was great the movie was excellent and really is far better then the goblet of fire and was more on par with the first two films of the series."
1129,7,"Good, but not the book!","Just before I start i want to say I actually did enjoy this film, but there were a lot of problems!"
1130,6,not bad,i went to see the new harry potter movie it was not to bad was better then harry potter 5 but still not as good as the first four that came out in the last two if you have not read the book which i did they took to much out of hp 5 not so much taking out of hp 6 but still not as good as the first four i just hope in the last they live most if not all the story the way it was in the book i don't care if it is a three or four hour movie keep it same as the book.i don't remember in hp 6 where harry potter is talking to a waitress in a café the book starts off with the ministers of magic popping in to see the prim minster to let him know about the deaths.just go read the book if you haven't already then watch the movie and judge for your self
1131,5,The movie was OK but having read the books I didn't like the changes!,"I just finished watching the movie and found it disappointing as compared to the completeness of the storyline in the books. The movie characters did an excellent job in their individual performances and interaction. The photography and visual effects were once again a pleasure to watch. The movies' storyline was OK but the changes made by the director/screenwriter subtracted substantially from the original story without any enhancement. The movie also eliminated several areas and characters of the book that are of importance in the final book. I would prefer to watch a 3 hour movie than to lose vital portions of a story to editing. Hopefully the individuals who made this movie will be far away from the final 2 movies or add a disclaimer to the beginning that states, ""if you enjoyed the books and their details you will find these movies OK for entertainment but not accuracy!""So my overall opinion and recommendation would be, if you enjoyed the other Harry Potter movies you will no doubt enjoy this one as well as it is very entertaining, moves along at a good pace and keeps you captivated. However if you have read the books and enjoyed the detail, the interweaving of critical characters, sub-plots and intricacies, then this movie will leave you somewhat on the flat side and wishing that Rowling would not allow people to change an already proved storyline."
1132,5,Why change a plot?,"For an avid fan of the books this movie doesn't live up! Its changes are so dramatic and drastic that it twists the original plot and destroys the settings for the next two movies. This book was set up to have a very dark plot with comedic scenes. However the director focused more on the comedic scenes and completely straying away from the dark themes. I understand it is essential to cut back certain scenes from the book in order to make a concise film. However the film is approximately over two and a half hours. It seemed like that the director choose to leave out the key defining moments of the book and focus on the smaller details. Emma Watson is a great actress for her age, however it seemed the director portrayed as a crazy jealous girl. The subtleties from the book are completely ignorant. Rupert portrayed Ron with some quality. Daniel Radcliffe, though many may disagree, is very one-dimensional and has trouble shifting from happiness to uncertainty. They never developed the relationships between Tonks and Lupin they sort of just throw that at your face. There is absolutely no chemistry between Ginny and Harry! This is unfortunate but was an essential characteristic of the book. The memories, why cut the backbone of the plot. This was essential in explaining the horcruxes and sets up Harry's adventure in the next book. They took only two memories which were shown with great quality. They never explain what apparition is, and again just throw it out at you. The movie uses lot of elements from the book, however they never explain anything. Why is Dumbledore allowed to apparate into Hogwarts? This was a stupid change, even if he is the one of the greatest wizards in the wizarding world. Why does Harry watch from below like a true coward? All the film portrayal's of Harry is one of action, why do they change that? It made so much sense in the book that Harry is physically frozen and immobile due to Dumbledore's sacrificial nature. They portray Dumbledore as a weak coward, that Malfoy can disarm? Why do they burn the Burrow, what significance is that, that is such an important setting in the next book! I read that Yates wanted to keep the fighting to a minimum in this film, as the next couple of movies are centered thematically around battle scenes. They even say that Dumbledore's funeral is the opening of the next film. Lets hope that the next two films are more accurate to the plot. Its an adaptation, not a creation on its own. Lets hope that the screenplay and direction and overall plot is not changed to such an extent that hurts the original plot! On the whole this movie is fairly enjoyable it in it as a film, leave out the book and appreciate the movie for what it is. As a true Harry Potter fan don't hate the movie entirely. Lets just hope that things change in the forthcoming films."
1133,4,Toooo many cuts,"I'm sorry to say that this movie disappointed me very much...I am a very big fan of Harry Potter (the books mostly) and i had very high expectations of this part of the story. There were too many cuts from the actual story and a lot of fillers. I just have one question.Since when did Harry Potter become a Comedy / Love story? The movie should've been axed on the memories that Dumbledor showed Harry concerning the younger Tom Riddle a.k.a The Dark Lord. The ending was really poor in details... The only part that I actually loved was the one in the cave with the fake Horcrux... Congrats on ruining something that might have been the greatest movie of the past few years and maybe of a few to come. Without any regrets for my words , Skip"
1134,5,Disappointing movie,"Of all the HP movies, this was the most disappointing. Even more disappointing than The Order of the Phoenix. I had read somewhere where David Yates said he was going to focus on Harry. Well, duh. But it doesn't have to be to the exclusion of others. In The Order of the Phoenix, the fight scene at the Ministry of Magic was all about Harry even the the Order and the DA were helping him. Now we have the Burrow, which is in the middle of a field not surrounded by trees, burning down courtesy of Bellatrix. Why was this scene even in the movie? Or why was Bellatrix shown destroying the Great Hall? Not in the book. Or the ending, when Harry chases after the Death Eaters. NOT! But done to ""focus on Harry"". Those 3 scenes could have been taken out and Dumbledore's funeral shown instead. Harry doesn't have to go it alone until the end of book 7. Crikey people. I can't believe JK was okay with how the plot went. I hope 7a and 7b show that it takes more than Harry to battle Voldemort until the end when Harry has to make the ultimate decision. That truly is his alone to make."
1135,4,Not very good movie,Hi i watched this movie a month ago i wanted to comment but i didn't read the novel back then so as most of people said the movie missed a lot of the action that were in the novel and some which is really important for the 7th part one of the things that really made me mad the burning of the burrow scene which was completely out of the book!!!! Also a lot of the memories that dumbledore showed harry isn't in the movie and of coarse the fight in Hogwarts isn't there too which was going to be really good if it was there also harry and Ginny relationship was no where to be found except a kiss!!! well a lot of people said if u haven't read the book before u watched the movie u will find it gr8 well i haven't of coarse it was fun but after all its a Hp movie and i excepted more of it!
1136,,Good...but.....lacking something,I just saw this today. While I was blown away completely by the visuals....the movie is absolutely stunning...I couldn't help but feel that in the making of this movie those breathtaking visuals were relied upon much much too heavily. There was so much missed opportunity. 
1137,7,Was a bit disappointed...but still good.,"Well I have always been a Harry Potter Films & Books and have always loved them. So i was so excited to see this film, I read the book again for the 3rd time before I went to see the film."
1138,7,Good but not as good as number 3,I found this potter film relatively good and I think it is the second best. It is dark and funny with some superb performances.
1139,4,Why missed whole story with government and ministry of magic?,"In Deathly Hallows producers also will erase racism and dictatorial rules against mud-bloods, because they afraid so in China will be forbidden and don't earn little money? (why they didn't show comic fight brothers Weasley against YOU KNOW WHO?, do producers afraid so in China people will see Voldemort=China regime) For political reasons removed from movie Fred and George slogan: WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POO — THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION! I see in Harry Potter hope for nations fighting against regime and racism. Conclude: big disappointment this film adaptation of HP."
1140,3,Only watch it if you haven't read the book,I cannot believe how screwed up this movie is. They talk about stuff they haven't even explained so you probably wouldn't know what they were talking about in the movie if you haven't read the book. It's ridiculous! And to think I got excited to go see this movie. I sat through the movie thinking: where is Bill and Fleur? Why didn't they even talk about Horcruxes? Why was the Burrow burned down? Where was the wedding? Where is Scrimgeour? When did Lupin and Tonks get together in the movie? AND WHY IS THERE NO BATTLE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE!?!?!?!? I am confused as to why J.K. Rowling even let them turn this book into a movie.
1141,6,As a fan of the book I find the adaptation to film didn't mesh well.,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was an amazing book that contained central ideas which were not faithfully and accurately represented in the film. Firstly, Harry is guided by Dumbledore through different memories of specific events concerning the antagonist Voldemort. Harry is asked by Dumbledore to take special classes that involve understanding the true nature and development of Tom Riddle as he evolved into the story's antagonist Voldemort. The story as it was told in the book was a complete dissection of Tom Riddle's character. It showed how Tom lacked genuine positive affect towards his peers at school. Harry learned how truly focused Tom Riddle was on the manipulation,coercion,and domination of individuals at school. Later on as the memory lessons continued Harry is exposed to a new Tom Riddle one who has become destructive and murderous. Dumbledore reveals to Harry the true extent of Tom Riddle's obsession with power leading to the eventual transformation into Voldemort. Not much of this is in the film as to lead one to wonder why such a main part of the story was left so bare of any life. The director, David Yates does not faithfully explore the triangular relationship between Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore that is so pervasive in Harry Potter's world most notably as to the fact when he fails to distinguish how important all of Voldemort's memories are to Harry's own view of himself. The problem is that someone who hasn't read the books or seen the other films can't decipher how much of an impact Voldemort's personal development and actions have affected Harry's own individual thinking and behavior in Half Blood Prince. The memories that Dumbledore reveals to Harry are so important that to ignore the viewing of one leads to an incomplete preservation of each of those character's foundation, story, and film. As to not seeing all the memory scenes as a fan who is looking forward to them it is disappointing and sad as they are not in the film. Also, keep in mind that the essence of who Tom Riddle has become drives Harry and Dumbledore's emotions and actions in their final quest together. Consequently, not to include all the memories takes away from the importance that memories have in making Harry and Dumbledore go search for the last Horcrux."
1142,7,Very Disappointed,"I vote 7 simply because it is a Harry Potter film. It was not a bad film but in contrast to the book so much (what i would see as vital) information has been omitted. I find this really sad and now wonder how much is going to be left out of the final film considering they have shut doors on plots from this one that finish in the next one. Do they intend to incorporate everything important to the story line, omitted from film 6 into film 7? If this film is a taste of things to come then i think the last film will not quite live up to previous Harry Potter films, and will thus end an brilliant series on a very poor note. I do understand that some parts of the book do need to be edited for film but i believe they have edited the book a little too much."
1143,7,Half Full,"While many people are focusing on how the movie left things out of the book the fail to see what the movie included. Such as fenir greyback, Hermione creating the canaries, and many small details that can also be found in the book. Also many of the things missing at the end of the movie are going to be put into the beginning of the next movie, such as the funeral. I think we should stop concentrating on what the movie is missing, and focus on what it has. No book can ever be perfectly made into a movie and include every single detail, that is just impossible, so as a whole the Harry Potter movies have done a pretty good job in incorporating the books into the movie and not having us sit in the theater for 5 hours, though some of us wouldn't mind that."
1144,4,Wow! What a disappointment!,I'm not going into the all of the stuff that is wrong with the movie. It's been done over and over.
1145,4,"Torn, But Over All, Not Very Good","I found myself very torn with this movie. I am an avid HP book lover and have not been too happy with the adaptations since David Yates came into play. However, Half-Blood Prince was my favorite book, barely beating out Deathly Hollows, so I went to go see it when it came out."
1146,7,Don't be over dramatic!,OK. so i may not be the biggest potter fan in the world but i think you're being slightly over dramatic! The wedding between bill and Fleur is not exactly vital. and as for not being able to understand what is going on it is plain enough... i have read each book albeit only once but i still understood what was going on throughout the whole thing. and as for overplaying the whole thing between Ron and lavender they had to somehow downplay the dark side of the book so that it was still suitable for the younger audience and somehow i think they well have to do the something with the seventh and eighth film unless they plan on cutting off half of their audience. If you want the full story your obviously not going to get it in in 2.5 hours! there's only so much they can put into the film... and people enjoy the films... so they read the books as well. As for the battle scene although it wasn't fully panned there was still a hint of it and the reason Snape did nothing and didn't fight back is because HE'S ACTUALLY A GOODY!!!! The funeral scene however i agree was essential and missed out however since the next one is 2 films i would care to venture the guess that the opening of the first one will be the funeral... just as a way to remind people what happened at the end of the last film!
1147,7,People Need To Calm Down,"People need to calm down and stop whining about the film. They are so obsessed with what they think the film should be like they don't want to accept it. I feel people are expecting too much, they build up fantasies where the film will be an exact translation of the book. Who wants that!? It would be completely boring and the film would be far to long. It is fine if you feel they should have included more (i agree) but there is no need to get so angry and write of the whole movie. It would be interesting to see how many complainers could fit a fairly large book into a short space of time and satisfy both readers of the book and people who have only seen the films while keeping the mood and setting the tone and plot up for the next book. Also the next book is being made into two films, they might want to make this film more light-hearted and romantic because the next two will be dark throughout most of it. They might squeeze more of what was missing in this film into the next."
1148,3,Loved the book but extremely disappointed with the movie,"The movie just like the last, is a complete disappointment. "
1149,3,Worst adaptation from HP books,"This is the worst of all. Lack of screen time cannot be a excuse for this. They wasted so much time in showing Romance. Rowling uses Romance as a diversion in the books. Half Blood Prince is about Voldemot and how to kill him. Harry has to understand his weakness and find ways to kill him. This is the simple theme of HP6. Director just simply forgot this. The beauty of the books are the plots are water tight. One simply cant find a hole in it. While in the movie,there are huge plot holes. How are they going to explain how Harry is going to find the Horcruxes. This movie is just a one time watch and we just have to hope that the next one will be good,given that they are taking it as 2 movies."
1150,5,Too choppy and not enough 3D,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan but I was highly disappointed in Half Blood Prince. While this director did an amazing job on the last film, this one presented too choppy in my opinion."
1151,8,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince: A Continuous Battle between Good and Evil.,"The 6th movie in the Harry Potter collection, this movie is another journey of Harry, Daniel Radcliffe, in a struggle against evil. His close friends, Ron played by Rupert Grint, and Herimone played by Emma Watson join Harry to try to find the person who is responsible for the treacherous acts at their school against Professor Dumbledore and who is the mysterious owner of Harry's textbook called the Half Blood Prince, join Harry. The movie keeps the viewer entertained with the finding of clues and puzzles to solve in order to find those who are part of the notorious band of Death Eaters, those that have pledged allegiance to Lord Voldermort. Through the film, certain romantic relationships unfold. While these events take a back seat to the main plot, they hold importance in the characters normal lives and future. The end of the movie will have the audience wanting to grab the next Harry Potter movie as soon as possible to find out what happens next. It seems that there are similarities between Draco Malfoy played by Tom Felton and Harry. They come across as total opposites but both are powerful wizards that have the support of different groups. Each has their own agenda to be fulfilled, though each stands in the way of the other. They are destined to be enemies. Professor Snape looks after Draco and Professor Dumbledore looks after Harry throughout this film. Again, Snape and Dumbledore are very different from each other in their behavior and appearance representing good and compassionate to insensitive, cold, and vicious. The majority of the Potter movies have played upon this same theme. The previous Harry Potter theme in The Order of the Phoenix was very similar to this one. It involved Harry and his friends trying to stop the evil followers of Lord Voldermort from enhancing their position to become more powerful and destroy those wizards that attempt to stop them. There is some humor in the movie but for the most part it is dark film and tragedy arises in this film with sacrifices made in order to stop Lord Voldermort. The movie used interesting color effects to portray the theme. The color was almost non-existent to the point of a black and white hue. I feel the director wanted the viewer to focus more on the actions of the characters. This use of low color hue helped us from being distracted from pretty scenery and kept our attention on what is unfolding throughout the film. This low color filming also seems to help enhance Harry and the others struggle against the evil forces working against them. The music helped to enforce the themes in many of the scenes. There is a fight scene between Draco and Harry. The music is fast paced, as is this action scene. Harry and Draco are chanting deadly spells at one another as items around them blow up or are destroyed. The music is loud and encompassing with the sound effects of the spells increased to increase the battle between the two. There is another scene where Harry and Ginny battle the Death Eaters out in a field. The music is again tense and evil sounding reflecting the presence of the evil characters and their devious intentions. The movie has twists and unexpected outcomes that catch the viewers off guard. The struggle of good and evil continues throughout the movie and is reflected in movies' use of color and music. The editing and use of camera work bring this fantasy world to life and make us feel we ourselves are part of this everlasting struggle to conquer the evil the Lord Voldermort and his followers. I have a great appreciation for this film they way it was created and presented the theme throughout the film."
1152,9,Captured the feeling and characters,Out of all Harry Potter movies I like this one the best. It captures the characters and feeling of Hogwarts better then any other movie of this series. The atmosphere is thick and lets the viewer dive right into Hogwarts and the magical world it contains.
1153,8,One of the better ones in the franchise,"""Half-Blood Prince"" was a definite improvement on the previous effort, which was largely static and drab-looking. Director David Yates learns from his mistakes, coaxed better performances from the young leads and visually made the movie far more arresting than ""Order of the Phoenix'."
1154,10,Anıl Tufekcı,"I think harry potter is the best movie I have ever seen because it's beautiful.There are a lot of hard work.I wish Dumbledore didn't die. I felt sorry because of it.Severus Snape is a good man but his character's figure is bad.The movie and the book are different from each other.Some character 's(Albus Dumbldore,Severus Snapes,Harry Potter,Rebeus Hagrid,Hermonie,VOLDEMORT...) were good and success.I know some of the characters.I think they are so talented.I want to continue this movie and book.This movie is perfect.Mehmet Hodja is the best teacher of the world.He is handsome and clever so we are lucky student."
1155,9,Not like the book.,"I rate it nine because it was emotional enough to make my best buddy and I cry in the theater. All the Harry Potter movies are a disservice to the books and I wish they would all be redone someday. Nobody will read the books because of the movies! Read the books! The movies are badly done!! I didn't like the quirkiness and stupid jokes littering this movie or the fact that emotional and moving bits of the book were left out. Additionally I don't know if the way Dumbledore acted was supposed to add to the stupid humor or if they were trying to make him like that, it was dumb. The music on this movie was very fitting to the nostalgia of the books and the movie did get very emotional."
1156,6,HBP falls short of expectations....,"I was quite disappointed by the outcome of the movie. The trailer seemed so promising...but then again, trailers ARE made to promote movies."
1157,8,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, directed by David Yates and screen play by Steve Kloves, is a captivating addition to the series. For those who have not read the series and only watch the movies, the movie definitely had enough in it to keep you interested and did not leave room for questions. However, for Harry Potter fans who have read the books, it is clear that the movie is missing some essential pieces that provide a lot more information to the plot. In both senses, it was still a good movie that was well produced with remarkable actors and actresses."
1158,6,Left Feeling Frustrated,"As the title of this review indicates, I left the theater yesterday feeling frustrated. Because this film was so close to being great, had so much potential, and just didn't follow through, in my opinion."
1159,9,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.,"Warner Bros is finally revealing the 6th tome of the famous saga Harry Potter. A movie that many fans were waiting for, but the best is yet to come... Many secrets are unveiled about Lord Voldemort, especially secrets from his childhood and many characters are getting closer to each other. However an horrible betrayal is about to happen..."
1160,8,Surprisingly good,"*** CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS**** I'm a HUGE Harry Potter fan and I fell in love with the books, so when I decided to watch this movie I had high expectations. And I wasn't disappointed!! (mostly) As usual, the cast were outstanding, Luna was brilliant, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was sassy and easy to connect with. I'm also a Draco Malfoy fan (I know he's got a lot of haters, but I think he's great) and Tom Felton was perfect once again! Throughout the whole film I knew what he had to do and felt so bad! I was choke-sobbing in the sink scene and yelled at Harry for using ""Sectumsempera!"" on him. Innocent, Harry? I beg to differ. Felton's delivery is great too. Although my favourite Dumbeldore actor is Richard Harris, Michael Gambon did very well here, as always, and delivered a rich performance. I started crying again when Dumbeldore died! This scene also had me going ""aw, yes, go, Malfoy!! It's so sweet you can't kill him!"" and ""You GIT, Snape!!"" Alan Rickman is fabulous here as well. Delivery once again amazing, and bitterness true to the character. If you're a Harry Potter fan, (books, movies or both) I think it is crucial you see this movie, so long as you see 1-5 first! Long live Harry Potter and happy watching!"
1161,6,Fine performances save the production,"I have read every Harry Potter book, have viewed every movie in theaters and purchased every DVD. I and my other 3 Potter fans have enjoyed the way the books had been faithfully presented on film until now. All four of us rate the film as a 6 out of 10. We understand that this chapter in Harry's adventures is a setup for the last two films that are in production. But whoever made the decision to try to cram Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince into one production made an unfortunate decision. The book has far too much information to ignore. Two of my friends who had not read the Potter books thought the film to be disjointed. I had the same thoughts about the script and editing."
1162,9,UNDERRATED,"Just because this movie is not like the books, doesn't mean that it is as bad as people call, if you think of it as a sequence without connections to the books, you will see that is much more than just a bad adaptation."
1163,8,The Half-Blood Prince is the most successful film in the series so far.,"Here's a small essay on book-to-film adaptations under the guise of a film review. Anyone who read a single book and watched a single movie in their lifetime should know that a five-hundred-page novel can not be squeezed word-by-word into a two-hour movie. Actually, I should say 'should' not be squeezed. That's because a five-hundred-page book, no matter how much of a page turner it might be, will most likely end up as a boring and monotone viewing experience if it's translated to the silver screen chapter by chapter, scene by scene. The first example that comes into mind is the film version of The DaVinci Code."
1164,3,Where did the plot go?????,"I have been waiting for this film to come out for the past one and a half year and to say that I'm disappointed would be putting it really lightly. What happened to Harry Potter? What happened to the plot? The whole time I was sitting and waiting to see a coherent story telling about Tom Riddle's past, which has led him to becoming the dark lord; the emotional bonding between the characters and not some lame jokes about puberty and growing up; the grand fight at Hogwarts at the end of the book, where once again you come close to realizing that this is true, that you might lose everything in just a matter of minutes, and which brings Harry to the emotional peak, where he's finally clear about his mission as the chosen one; Dumbledor's funeral with the centaurs, which is a very touching scene in the book, but all of these were cut out of this two hour movie adaptation of a teen written fan-fiction based on the Harry Potter realm. "
1165,5,Boring.,"Now, I'll admit it - I haven't read the book of the Half Blood Prince. But - I am gathering from the user comments thus far that they missed out all the good stuff and just included the crap. Well do you know what - as someone just going in and watching Half Blood Prince as a film - boy can you tell thats what they've done. Even my 4 year old daughter could tell. She whispered in my ear halfway through the film and said ""Daddy, this is boring - when is Harry Potter going to do something?""... this is a girl who sat through the zzzzzzzzzzz fest that was Transformers 2 without batting an eyelid. Do you know what - I'd have to agree with her. This film was really boring - with very little happening in it. The poorest Potter movie by far."
